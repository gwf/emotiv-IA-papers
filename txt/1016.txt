Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the cerebellum is emerging as a novel
non-invasive tool to modulate the activity of the cerebellar circuitry. In a single blinded
study, we applied anodal tDCS (atDCS) of the cerebellum to assess its effects on brain
entropy and brain rhythms during self-paced sequential finger movements in a group
of healthy volunteers. Although wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) systems cannot
compete with traditional clinical/laboratory set-ups in terms of accuracy and channel
density, they have now reached a sufficient maturity to envision daily life applications.
Therefore, the EEG was recorded with a comfortable and easy to wear 14 channels
wireless helmet (Epoc headset; electrode location was based on the 10–20 system).
Cerebellar neurostimulation modified brain rhythmicity with a decrease in the delta band
(electrode F3 and T8, p < 0.05). By contrast, our study did not show any significant
change in entropy ratios and laterality coefficients (LC) after atDCS of the cerebellum in
the 14 channels. The cerebellum is heavily connected with the cerebral cortex including
the frontal lobes and parietal lobes via the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway. We
propose that the effects of anodal stimulation of the cerebellar cortex upon cerebral
cortical rhythms are mediated by this key-pathway. Additional studies using high-density
EEG recordings and behavioral correlates are now required to confirm our findings,
especially given the limited coverage of Epoc headset.

INTRODUCTION
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique
aiming to induce short to prolonged functional changes in Central Nervous System (CNS)
circuits and to promote neuroplasticity (Priori et al., 2014). The cerebellum is particularly suited
for application of tDCS for both anatomical and electrophysiological reasons (Grimaldi et al.,
2014; Ferrucci et al., 2015). Cerebellar tDCS induces neurophysiological changes by modulating
cerebellum-brain inhibition (CBI) through effects upon the cerebellar cortex (Grimaldi et al., 2016).

The Modulation of Brain Entropy

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Anodal tDCS (atDCS) exerts an excitatory effect upon the
Purkinje cell layer, unlike cathodal tDCS (ctDCS). There is
currently a growing interest in the potential applications of tDCS
to the cerebellum given the major contributions of the cerebellar
circuitry not only in motor domain but also in the so-called
cognitive operations and in the emotional processing (Koziol
et al., 2014; Lupo et al., 2015). Recent studies point out that tDCS
of the cerebellum is even emerging as a potential therapeutical
tool to tune down symptoms in cerebellar ataxias. For instance, it
has been demonstrated that a single session of anodal cerebellar
tDCS transiently improves symptoms in patients with cerebellar
ataxia and thus represents a promising technique for future
rehabilitative approaches (Benussi et al., 2015).
Electroencephalogram (EEG) brain rhythms are markers
of the cerebral activity and can be used to control a braincomputer interface (BCI). It has been shown that tDCS can
modulate brain rhythms and that atDCS can significantly
impact the alpha band (Spitoni et al., 2013). This modulation
is particularly interesting and shows promising perspective to
enhance BCI event related desynchronization/synchronization.
It could enhance BCI wearable BCI application such as the one
developed by Looned et al. (2014) in the upper limb for a drinking
task.
Brain entropy is currently used to estimate the information
conveyed in a signal and is especially applied to characterize
EEG signals in disorders of the CNS, such as neurodegenerative
diseases, epilepsy and coma. One typical example is the study of
Abásolo et al. (2006). The authors have assessed the variations
of EEG entropy in Alzheimer’s disease and have tested the
hypothesis that the regularity of the patients’ EEG was higher
compared to age-matched controls by computing spectral
entropy and sample entropy. They found that the analysis of
sample entropy could distinguish patients from control subjects
(at electrodes P3, P4, O1 and O2), bringing the possibility of
an early diagnosis for a very common devastating disorder in
the elderly. No difference was found for spectral entropy. In
the field of epilepsy, Kannathal et al. (2005) have compared
different entropy estimators for the detection of seizures. Their
method reached a 90% classification accuracy between control
and epileptic EEG. In disorders of consciousness, entropy
studies show reduced information processing in minimallyconscious-state and unresponsive-wakefulness-syndrome, in line
with impaired information flow (Thul et al., 2016). Overall,
entropy allows a better estimation of the information flow in the
brain. However, very little is known on the EEG entropy as a
neural correlate in a context of voluntary movements of the upper
limbs.
In the current study, our hypothesis was that tDCS of the
cerebellum modulates brain rhythms and/or entropy during
self-paced sequential finger movements. The rationale to assess
the effects of tDCS of the cerebellum on brain entropy and
rhythms is that the cerebellar circuitry is essential in the
computation of critical movement parameters such as the timing,
the organization of motor sequences or the reconstruction of
sequences of events to predict the future (Braitenberg, 1967; Ivry
and Spencer, 2004; Molinari et al., 2008; Leggio and Molinari,
2015).

Participants
The participants were asked to sign a written consent, following
approval of the study by the Ethical Committee of the Hôpital
Erasme-ULB (Study reference: P2014/378). The following
exclusion criteria were applied:
•
•
•
•
•
•

History of neurological disease or head trauma
Intake of psychotropic drug
Alcohol intake in the previous 12 h
Metal implant in the body (i.e., pace-maker)
Skin lesion over the skull
Pregnancy

We included 20 healthy subjects (mean age ± SD:
24.0 ± 8.3 years; 12 males/8 females). In order to determine the
dominant side in the upper limbs, the Edinburgh handedness
inventory was used (Oldfield, 1971). The majority of subjects
were right handed (n = 18). Due to the discovery of abnormal
excess of power in the beta band during whole protocol, subjects
6 and 16 were excluded from the analysis (see Figure 1 and ‘‘EEG
Analysis’’ Section below on data analysis, z-scores of average beta
band for subjects 6 and 16 compared to the other subjects were
respectively: 5.86 and 5.82). The results thus relate to a group of
n = 18 subjects.

Characteristics of the EEG Helmet and
Wireless Recording
The EEG helmet was a wearable, comfortable and wireless
headset to avoid bulky equipment and time-consuming
procedures that would prevent further potential applications
in the ‘‘real world’’ (Berka et al., 2004; Debener et al., 2012;

mean values and the whiskers represent the 10 and 90 percentiles. The dots
are the outlying values. Note the excess of Beta activity for subjects 6 and 16.
The Beta band is expressed in percent of the complete spectrum (%).
Z-scores for subject 6 and 16 are respectively: 5.86 and 5.82.

and unobtrusive EEG helmet now widely used in literature
(Debener et al., 2012; Ekandem et al., 2012; Badcock et al.,
2013; Steinhubl et al., 2015)1 . Channels location is based on
the 10–20 system. Sampling rate is 128 Hz (first acquired at
2048 Hz then down sampled), with a resolution of 0.51 µV.
The bandwidth is 0.2–43 Hz. This wireless EEG also includes
a two-axis gyroscope to record head rotation (sensitivity is
2.0 mV/deg/s; 1 bit corresponds to about 1.61 deg/s). The
EEG helmet was placed on the subjects’ head as recommended
by the manufacturer to obtain reproducible results (the two
front electrodes are located two fingers above the supraorbital ridge and the two bottom electrodes are placed on
the mastoids, see Figure 2A). The continuous monitoring
of impedance of each electrode was performed during the
experiments (the value of the impedance is displayed online as
a color code). The electrodes were regularly moisturized with
physiological saline (NaCl 0.9%) using an adjustable pipette.
This operation is critical to maintain the effectiveness of the
helmet. Data were transferred to a laptop computer during the
acquisition.
Wireless EEG recordings (duration of each recording: 3 min)
were performed in a quiet room at rest, and subsequently during
the execution of sequential thumb-fingers movements in the
basal state, after sham session and after application of cerebellar
atDCS (see below). The sequence: (a) basal recording; (b) postsham; and (c) post-atDCS has been described earlier in a study
demonstrating the modulation of long-latency EMG responses
by non-invasive modulation of cerebellar activity (Grimaldi and
Manto, 2013). In such settings, atDCS has an after-effect lasting

Callan et al., 2015). Indeed, current EEG devices used in
the clinic are usually stationary, wired and cumbersome
systems (Mihajlovic et al., 2015). Although it is obvious
that wearable EEG systems still require developments and
cannot compete with traditional clinical/laboratory set-ups
in terms of accuracy and channel density (for instance, the
channels FC3, FC4, C3, C4, CP3 and CP4 are not present
on this helmet which a drawback for motor task. Future
study should address this issue), they have now reached a
sufficient maturity to envision daily life applications (Casson
et al., 2010; Balanou et al., 2013; Zao et al., 2014) and most
probably become one of the systems used in BCI applications
in the near future. The helmet was an Epoc headset (emotiv,
Eveleigh, NSW, Australia). This is a 14 channels wireless

instance, Grummett et al. (2015) made a comparative study of different
wireless EEG systems including the Epoc and showed that, even with
limitations, these devices were suitable for research paradigms. One example
of practical use of this helmet to assist upper limb movements on the basis of
EEG signals was provided by Looned et al. (2014).

at least 1 h (Nitsche and Paulus, 2000, 2001; Nitsche et al.,
2003). In rodents, we have observed strong effects of atDCS
of the cerebral cortex (duration of stimulation of 20 min) on
CBI with changes lasting more than 2 h (Manto et al., 2011).
Therefore, sham session has to be administered before the actual
stimulation.
For the first recording at rest, subjects were instructed not
to move the eyes/the head/the limbs, to keep the eyes closed, to
avoid jaw movements and deep breathing, and to remain calm
during the whole recording. Subjects were also asked to remain
silent during EEG recordings. The second recording was the
basal condition during the execution of self-paced movements.
Subsequently, the sham stimulation was applied during 20 min.
Then the subject was instructed to perform again the finger
movements (third recording: post-sham). Afterwards, atDCS of
the cerebellum was applied during 20 min, followed by the last
EEG recording (fourth recording: post-atDCS) during sequential

Subjects were comfortably seated in an armchair, with their
elbows on the armrests. The dominant forearm remained in the
vertical position during the task and the hand was recorded on
a video to check that correct sequential finger movements were
performed. The task was a self-paced sequential thumb to fingers

fingers) at a slow and comfortable speed as reported earlier in a
study comparing motor execution and mental imagery (Sauvage
et al., 2011).

EEG ANALYSIS
EEG signals were analyzed using Matlab (release 2014b, The
MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). First, the average offset
was removed for every EEG electrode and the signal was band
pass filtered using a 4th order Butterworth filter with cutoff
frequencies of 1 and 50 Hz (see Figure 3). Then the signal was
split into 2-s windows. Visual inspection of EEG signals did
not reveal contamination by eye-blinks or muscle bursts and
therefore no other artifact rejection technique was applied. Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT) was used to extract the Power Spectral
Density (PSD) of the signal. We applied a Hanning Window and
a zero padding (equal to the next power of 2 of the window
length plus 29 ; this is a general practice as computation time
is not an issue in this study) to increase accuracy (McNames,
2013).
The following quantities were computed for every channel on
both the PSD averaged across all the time windows and the PSD
computed from the complete signal. The Power Spectral Entropy
(PSE) was computed using the following formula (Freeman and
Quiroga, 2013):
E = −

N
X

pk log2 pk

(1)

k=1

where pk is the PSD of the kth frequency divided by the sum
of the complete PSD vector and N is the number of frequency
bins between the two cut frequencies of the band pass filter
(pk corresponds to the ratio of the kth frequency bin in the
spectrum). This ratio ranges from 0 when only one frequency bin
has a probability of 1 to log2 N for an equal frequency distribution
(white noise).
The Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) was also computed
using the following formula (Freeman and Quiroga,
2013):

FIGURE 6 | EEG Alpha/Delta ratio (complete EEG signal) for the
T8 electrode for all subjects per condition. The boxes correspond to the
25–75 percentiles, the continuous lines are the median values, the dotted lines
are the mean values and the whiskers represent the 10 and 90 percentiles.
The dots are the outlying values. Note the increase for the stimulation
condition. The Alpha/Delta ratio is expressed in percent (%), ∗ p < 0.05 as
compared to the three other conditions.

KLD =

where qk is the same as pk but computed for the rest or basal
condition only (both rest and basal reference have been used
in this study). This ratio is always positive and equals zero for
two similar probability distributions. It gets larger the further the
distributions are.
From the power spectra, the following frequency bands were
computed using a trapezoidal integration: Delta (1–4 Hz), Theta
(4–8 Hz), Alpha (8–12 Hz), Beta (12–30 Hz) and Gamma
(30–45 Hz). The integral between the frequency boundaries
was divided by the integral of the complete spectra (1–45 Hz)
and converted to percent. We also extracted the following
ratios of frequency bands integrals: Theta/Delta, Alpha/Delta,
Beta/Delta, Gamma/Delta, Beta/Alpha, Gamma/Alpha and
Beta2 /Alpha. The frequency bands were also computed using
the rest session as a common reference. The band integrals
were all divided by the integrals of the complete spectra
from the resting state condition (rest referenced frequency
bands).

sessions consisted of a 30 s ramp-up from 0 mA to 1.5 mA
followed by a 30 s ramp down to 0 mA. No current
was delivered during the following 19 min. Sham session
gives to the subject the feeling of being stimulated but
does not have any physiological effect (Gandiga et al., 2006;
Nitsche et al., 2008). For the active stimulation sessions, the
current was set to 1.5 mA and the duration to 20 min
(including a 30 s ramp up at the beginning) as reported
earlier (Grimaldi and Manto, 2013). Subjects were singleblinded: they were not aware if sham or actual stimulation was
applied. The anode (size: 5 × 6 cm) and the cathode (size:
9 × 7 cm) consisted in sponge electrodes with conductive
rubber inset. The anode was located halfway from the subject’s
mastoid process and the inion (Figure 2B) on the dominant
side (Grimaldi and Manto, 2013). The cathode was located
on the subject’s acromion. This electrodes’ setting ensures
stimulation of the lateral cerebellar cortex (Rampersad et al.,
2014).

mean was subtracted and data was divided by variance). To
test the difference in ratio distribution between conditions, an
analysis of variance (ANOVA) on ranks was performed using a
Kruskal-Wallis test. Normal data group of equal variance were
also tested using a one-way ANOVA. Multi-comparison testing
was done using the Student–Newman–Keuls (SNK) method.
We took into account the hand dominance (two subjects were
left-handed) to average EEG parameters (inversion of channels).
Statistical significance was set at 0.05.

From these frequency ratios, the Laterality Coefficient (LC
ratio) was computed using the following formula:
LC =

C−I
C+I

(3)

where C is Beta/Alpha ratio of the contralateral limb and I is the
Beta/Alpha ratio of the ipsilateral limb.
It should be pointed out that this is not the first study on
frequency bands computed from EEG signals collected with
the Epoc headset. In particular, this headset has been used
to assess the neurological and cardiovascular responses during
meditation (Steinhubl et al., 2015). The authors used Matlab
to compute the power produced in five frequency bands and
to identify the changes occurring during meditation. The same
headset has also been used to assess the brain response to
marketing stimuli (Khushaba et al., 2013). Furthermore, a study
by Wang et al. (2011) has used the EEG signals collected from
this headset to compute frequency bands ratio (Theta/Beta ratio)
and establish a fractal dimension based neurofeedback in serious
games. This ratio is a convenient technique to show an increase
or decrease in the PSD frequencies of the signal. We used a
similar approach.

RESULTS
As illustrated in Figure 4, an increase in the Theta/Delta
ratio computed from the average of PSD over time windows
was observed after application of atDCS over the cerebellum
compared to the three other conditions. This was statistically
significant for the electrode F3, contralaterally to the cerebellar
stimulation (p < 0.05). The same ratio computed on the complete
EEG signal showed the same increase on electrode F3 (p < 0.05,
Figure 5).
The Alpha/Delta ratio computed on the complete EEG signal,
showed a significant increase after stimulation for the electrode
T8 (p < 0.05, Figure 6) compared to the three other conditions.
The normality of data and the equal variance were respected. A
one-way ANOVA showed that only data of the basal condition
were statistically different compared to data of the post-atDCS
condition (p < 0.05).
Figure 7 shows the Delta frequency band computed from the
average of PSD over time windows for the electrodes F3 and T8.
The SNK showed a significant decrease in the frequency band

STATISTICAL PROCEDURES
Statistical analysis was performed using Matlab and Sigmaplotr
(Jandel Scientific, Germany). Descriptive statistics were
computed. Mean, median, quartiles and SD values were
extracted. Data normality was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk
test on mean normalized and variance-standardized data (data

DISCUSSION

We have excluded from the analysis two subjects due to
abnormal excess of power in the beta band. High level of
beta power can be observed in anxiety states (Beran, 2012),
after intake of drugs such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates
(Blume, 2006), after alcohol intake and is also common in
children suffering from hyperactivity (Clarke et al., 2013).
Recently, an excess of beta activity has also been observed
in case of conduct disorder and psychopathic traits (CalzadaReyes et al., 2016). Intake of psychotropic drug was denied
by our subjects and thus the origin of abnormal beta
band for these two subjects remains unclear. The excess of
high frequency oscillations likely reflects an imbalance in
the excitation-inhibition homeostasis in the cerebral cortex
(Orekhova et al., 2007). Given the key-role of high frequency
EEG rhythms for both perceptual and cognitive processes,
probably genetically determined abnormalities in the neuronal
mechanisms generating high frequency EEG rhythms have been
incriminated (Orekhova et al., 2007).

Our findings show a decrease in the Delta band for the electrodes
F3 and T8 during self-paced finger movements. By contrast,
EEG PSE and KLD showed no statistically significant change
after atDCS, suggesting that the cerebellar cortex could not be
a major modulator of brain entropy during self-paced sequential
finger movements. The LC ratio also did not show any significant
change, indicating that atDCS does not bring any significant
lateralized modification including in the Beta/Alpha ratio in this
study and electrode configuration. Also the fact that both ratios
of entropy (PSE and KLD) remain unaffected by atDCS suggests
that this non-invasive neurostimulation method does not bring
brain rhythms in a more disordered state at our electrodes
locations.

that our subjects could not distinguish the sham vs. anodal
stimulation.
Further research with a conventional high-density EEG
equipment and behavioral correlates should be undertaken
to establish the effects of atDCS during sequential finger
movements. Our study did not include dedicated measurements
of the kinematic profiles of finger flexion/extension movements.
In terms of behavioral correlates, the cortico-muscular coherence
should be studied to assess the coupling between EEG signals
and voluntary muscle discharges (Larsen et al., 2016; Zheng et al.,
2016).
This is the first study in human showing that atDCS of the
cerebellum tunes brain rhythmicity during self-paced sequential
finger movements. The anatomo-physiological substratum of
these changes could be the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways
(Strick et al., 2009) In particular, stimulation of the cerebellar
cortex modulates the activity of dentate nucleus which is heavily
and diffusely connected with the cerebral cortex (Dum and
Strick, 2003). The thalamus is a central node for the relay

It is important to point out that this study has several
limitations. First, although the EEG helmet is easy to wear
and is very comfortable, it has a low electrode density and
a small bandwidth compared to more conventional laboratory
grade EEG systems. Therefore, a study comparing the results
obtained with our wearable EEG device and a conventional
EEG should be carried out to confirm our findings. Second,
atDCS was applied over one cerebellar hemisphere and not
over the entire cerebellar cortex. Third, we applied one current
intensity (1.5 mA) and we did not assess the dose-response.
Fourth, we did not administer ctDCS to compare with atDCS
and we did not repeat the administration of atDCS over
several days. Finally, our study was single blinded. However,
regarding this latter limitation, it should be emphasized

and processing of sensitive and motor signals. Generation of
rhythmic activity occurs through the interaction of stereotyped
patterns of connectivity together with intrinsic membrane
and synaptic properties (McCormick et al., 2015). Indirect
modulation of the thalamic nuclei via the cerebello-thalamic
projections could modify the general brain dynamics and
redistribute its rhythms. Furthermore, it is now established that
the cerebellum is anatomically connected with basal ganglia in
reciprocal loops (Shakkottai et al., 2017). Therefore, atDCS of
the cerebellum could impact directly on the slow frequency
waves generated within basal ganglia to allow coherence in
the high frequency bands across the cortico-basal ganglia
network (López-Azcárate et al., 2013). Such mechanism is
suggested to contribute to the fine-tuning of the timing
of synchronization events across different structures in the
brain.
We found an effect of unilateral atDCS upon the EEG activity
of both cerebral hemispheres. What could be the anatomical
substrate? Not only the corpus callosum heavily links the
two cerebral hemispheres, but also the parallel fibers within
the cerebellar cortex cross the midline and allow a direct
anatomical communication between cerebellar hemispheres
(Bastian et al., 1998). Motor but also cognitive operations
such as executive demands are known to be associated with
bilateral cerebellar activations in fMRI paradigms (Küper et al.,
2016). These bilateral activations are subserved by numerous
loops between cerebral, cerebellar and brainstem nodes to
ensure the anatomical connectivity between both cerebral
hemispheres.
AtDCS of the cerebellum tunes fundamental brain rhythms.
This might have both fundamental and clinical implications.
Zhang et al. (2013) showed that an occlusion of the middle
cerebral artery in rodents induces a decrease in the alpha/delta
ratio and is associated with a loss of motor control. Application
of atDCS to the cerebellum could prevent this effect. This
could be tested at a very early stage of a stroke in human.
Also the modulation of brain rhythms induced by atDCS of
the cerebellum could be used in the future to enhance the

performance of wearable and multimodal BCIs aiming to assist
neurological patients. Indeed, BCI inefficiency remains currently
a major challenge (Zhang et al., 2015).

CONCLUSION
We demonstrate that atDCS of the cerebellum exerts an effect
in terms of brain rhythmicity without affecting brain entropy.
We suggest that atDCS of the cerebellum should be assessed
in neurological disorders characterized by an excess of low
frequencies EEG activity. We also suggest that there is a need
to include behavioral measurements in addition to conventional
high-density EEG measurements covering also sensorimotor
areas in future studies. Our data do not support potential
applications of atDCS of the cerebellum to modify brain entropy.
