Introduction: Computer games have attracted remarkable attentions in general publics with
different cultures and their effects are subject of research by cognitive neuroscientists. In the
present study, possible effects of the game Fifa 2015 on cognitive performance, hormonal levels,
and electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were evaluated in young male volunteers.
Methods: Thirty two subjects aged 20 years on average participated mutually in playing
computer game Fifa 2015. Identification information and general knowledge about the game were
collected. Saliva samples from the contestants were obtained before and after the competition.
Perceptive and cognitive performance including the general cognitive health, response delay,
attention maintenance, and mental fatigue were measured using PASAT test. EEG were recorded
during the play using EEG device and analyzed later using QEEG. Simultaneously, the players’
behavior were recorded using a video camera. Saliva cortisol levels were assessed by ELISA kit.
Data were analyzed by SPSS program.
Results: The impact of playing computer games on cortisol concentration of saliva before and
after the game showed that the amount of saliva plasma after playing the game has dropped
significantly. Also the impact of playing computer games on mental health, before and after the
game indicated that the number of correct answers has not changed significantly. This indicates
that sustained attention has increased in participants after the game in comparison with before
that. Also it is shown that mental fatigue measured by PASAT test, did not changed significantly
after the game in comparison to before that. The impact of game on changes in brain waves
showed that the subjects in high activity state during playing the game had higher power of the
EEG signals in most of the channels in lower frequency bands in compared to normal state.

Key Words:
Cognitive, EEG, Saliva,
Cortisol, Video Games

Discussion: The present study showed that computer games can positively affect the stress
system and the perceptual-cognitive system. Even though this impact was not significant in most
cases, the changes in cognitive and hormonal test and also in brain waves were visible. Hence,
due to the importance of this matter, it is necessary to create control systems in selecting the types
of games for playing.

1. Introduction

omputer games are a common and prevalent cultural issue in all languages. These
games, similar to other human-made instruments and modern technology are made as a
response to what is appealing to the human
and have important role in daily life’s skills (Thirunarayanan & Vilchez, 2012). The action game FPS (First-person shooter) for instance, on one hand leads to boosting
brain function in response speed, concentration, attention, spatial cognition and life skills (Bejjanki et al., 2014;
Feng, Spence, & Pratt, 2007) and on the other hand, exciting, stressful and scary games have negative effects on
the cognition and right processes of the nervous system.
Another harmful effect is on people’s thoughts, their
lifestyle, sometimes happening so subtly that they don’t
notice but does irreparable damages (Gray, Braver, &
Raichle, 2002; Tamamiya, Matsuda, & Hiraki, 2014).
At the thinking process of people, different parts of
brain structure, including prefrontal area are involved.
The thinking process includes issues such as creative
thinking, decision-making, aesthetics, judgment, and
problem solving (Kringelbach & Rolls, 2004; Rosenbloom, Schmahmann, & Price, 2012). Targeted computer
games can promote a healthy lifestyle and life skills such
as confidence, strengthen the spirit of partnership and
cooperation, develop human emotions, improve physical and mental health, improve the adaptability of the
person with themselves, others and their environment of
life (Thirunarayanan & Vilchez, 2012). Browsing into the
frontal cortex with other parts of the brain, including the
neo-cortex, cerebellum system, basal complexes and limbic system approves the theories in relation to cognitiveperceptual processes and the decision-making system
and specifies a neuroanatomic model of the decisionmaking chain in the brain (Krawczyk, 2012; Kringelbach
& Rolls, 2004).
The brain of a hyperactive child always distracts while
doing a task and has a deficiency of attention. The clinical
demonstration of the condition of these children includes
carelessness, negligence and disregarding details, difficulty in social relationships and low self-esteem (Lofthouse,
Arnold, & Hurt, 2012; Rosenbloom, et al., 2012). Over
10 years of research on the impact of computer games on
the human brain indicates that puzzle games like Tetris
can increase the effectiveness of parts of the brain such
as problem solving, decision making and processing. The
impact of computer games on the human brain has long
been studied. One of the most notable studies in this field
was conducted in 1992 by a neurologist at the University

194

of California, Richard Higher. He studied the impact of
computer games on the users’ brains. The impact of Tetris
game shows how learning to play a game like Tetris can
affect the brain function (to increase spatial skills) and a
game like FPS improves functions such as selective spatial attention and spatial perceptive analysis in an equal
way (Foroozandeh & Mahdieh, 2014; Masson, Bub, &
Lalonde, 2011).
Showing faces with different emotional states lead to
intense activity in the amygdala. Including the amygdala
responses to emotional behavior and stimulating changes
related to the physiology of the human nervous system.
Scientists have also proven that amygdala response to aggressive faces is stronger than responses to happy faces
(Davis & Granger, 2009; Feinstein, Adolphs, Damasio,
& Tranel, 2011; Nater & Rohleder, 2009). On the other
hand, scientists have shown that computer games can
lead to changes in stress factors and result in changes in
brain function. Several studies have indicated that chronic
stress due to continuous stimulation of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal stress system (Hypothalamus-PituitaryAdrenal Axis, HPA) causes chronic sustained increase in
plasma density of cortisol in the blood (S. Lupien et al.,
1999; S. J. Lupien et al., 1998; Wolf et al., 2001). Due to
this matter, continuous stimulation of these receptors occurs in the areas of the brain with high cortisol receptor
(McEwen & Morrison, 2013). This constant stimulation
aids the activation of glutamate receptors in the brain and
the system stimulates receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate,
NMDA and so motivates the excessive entrance of calcium ions into cells of targeted tissue (Lofthouse et al.,
2012).
On the other hand, increasing the time of stimulation and the excessive entrance of calcium ions into the
cells through the NMDA receptors, the activity of the
next group of enzymes have more role in the process
of programmed cell death (Apoptosis) (S. J. Lupien &
Lepage, 2001). For this reason, most of the damage of
chronic stress relates to areas of the brain which have a
lot of glucocorticoid receptors. Research has shown that
the hippocampus as an important structure in the brain
is involved in the memory and the main site of expression and activity of these receptors is the hippocampus
(S. J. Lupien et al., 2005). Previous extensive research
suggests that short-term stress with rapid increase in cortisol concentration results in increase in cognitive abilities associated with the hippocampus such as memory (its
types). The research indicates that memory loss occurs
in people with chronic stress conditions (apart from the
stress type) (S. J. Lupien & Lepage, 2001; McEwen &
Morrison, 2013). Thus it seems that increase of the stress

this study is to study and analyze the changes in cognitive and hormonal changes created in brain waves while
playing the game of Fifa 2015 in young male volunteers
so that by analyzing these changes before, during, and
after the game we can reach a proper approach as to how
computer games affect different functions of people.

2. Methods

time (chronic stress) and imposing several types of stress
simultaneously not only leads to memory loss, but more
importantly leads to disorders in brain processes related
to memory such as decision-making, responding, the
ability of integrating various sensory inputs and different types of memory (Wolkowitz, Lupien, Bigler, Levin,
& Canick, 2004). Research has shown that current computer games are able to affect a wide variety of cognitiveperceptive functions in the users. These changes can be
due to functional changes in different brain parts. Researchers have used the brain wave recorder machine to
study the various functions of the brain during games recorded (Minchev, Dukov, & Georgiev, 2009; Sepúlveda,
Alonso, Guevara, & González, 2014).
While recording process, the neurons of different areas
of brain are created through displacement ions involved
in neuronal function. Cerebral cortex is the center of high
mental processes, the place of registration of feelings,
starting intentional actions, making decisions and formulating plans (Gray et al., 2002). Electrical activity of neurons in the brain causes the formation of brain electrical
activity called brain waves. Brain waves have different
types and functionality and are divided into different types
depending on the frequency (delta wave, theta wave, alpha wave, wave SMR, wave, beta, gamma wave). The
performance and activity level of each of these waves can
vary in different circumstances. The amount of changes
differ by the type of brain function wave (Başar, BaşarEroglu, Karakaş, & Schürmann, 2001; Sepúlveda et al.,
2014). Using the recognition software PASAT, changes
in cognitive function including attention, mental fatigue,
and general health of the volunteers was examined before
and after the game (Tombaugh, 2006). The purpose of

32 university student volunteers with an average age
of 20 years enrolled in the project. The questionnaire included personal details and questions about their favorite
game, type of games, time of day to play, and many other
questions. The volunteers participated in a double tournament game of Fifa 2015 football match. The game was
played as a single knockout and elitism index showed to
improve the quality of the results. Before and after the
game, saliva samples were collected from all the participants in the study in Falcon tubes of 10 mL volume
and was maintained at -20°C. On the day of experiment,
first the samples were melted at room temperature and
after centrifuging with round 3000 for 5 minutes, 20 microliters of each sample was separated for testing. Then,
Cortisol ELISA kit was employed for the measurement
of human salivary cortisol (Cortisol ELISA KIT, Diagnostics Biochem Canada Inc, dbc).
The PASAT test was used to assess cognitive performance of the subjects. PASAT software was used to
assess cognitive perceptual activity of the players before and after the game (Tombaugh, 2006). In this test,
61 numbers between 1 and 9 are presented randomly in
time intervals of 3 seconds. The testee should add every
two consecutive end numbers up together and tells their
number before presenting a new number. For example, if

results showed that the plasma levels in saliva after a Fifa
2015 football game has significantly decreased after the
game in comparison with before that (P<0.05) (Figure 1).
3.2. The impact of Fifa 2015 computer game on
mental health (number of correct answers) in
PASAT test, before and after the game
The results showed that the number of correct answers
has not changed significantly before and after the game
and so the participants’ mental health has not undergone
significant changes (Figure 2).

Figure 3. The response speed in participants after computer

comparison with before the game (P<0.05).

the numbers are 2 and 6 respectively, to respond correctly
they should say number 8. Each testee would give some
correct answers in every test which (the accuracy of the
response) would be compared to each other for every test
before and after it. The average response time (response
speed), the longest chain of correct answers (sustained attention) and the longest chain of incorrect answers (mental fatigue) are also examined in this study.
Moreover, during the game, the participants’ brain
waves that were recorded using EEG machine from
Emotive Company in wireless way were examined.
During the game from beginning to end, the changes
in brainwaves were recorded using quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) by placing 14 electrodes on
the volunteers’ heads (based on quantitative evaluation
index). They were also displayed based on intensity of
brainwaves activity in two-dimensional and three-dimensional maps as different colors using Brain Mapping
software. PASAT data analysis and the amount of cortisol
level were analyzed by SPSS and changes of brain waves
were evaluated by QEEG during the game.

3.3. The impact of Fifa 2015 computer game on response time
The results of PASAT test showed that the participants’
response time after the game has increased significantly
in comparison with before the game (P<0.05) (Figure 3).
3.4. The impact of Fifa 2015 computer game on
sustained attention
As mentioned, the longest chain of correct answers in
PASAT test are considered as a measure of sustained attention. Results showed that sustained attention has increased after the game in comparison with before that,
however, it has not been statistically significant (Figure
4).
3.5. The impact of Fifa 2015 computer game on
mental fatigue
The longest chain of wrong answers in PASAT test is
considered as a symbol of mental fatigue. Results showed

The data were expressed as mean and standard deviation (Mean±SEM). Paired t-Test was used to determine
the significance of the within-group differences. P<0.05
was considered statistically significant.

in the figure 6 and 7, the power of the signal has been
increased in most of the electrodes in lower bands (3Hz)
during the high activity compared to the time of starting
the game. This can be due to the high activity during playing the game. This increased of power can be also seen
in occipital electrodes in higher frequency bands (15Hz).
In contrast, the power of the signal has been decreased in
occipital lobe (in 6 and 10Hz) and in frontal lobe (in 15
and 18Hz) (Figure 6,7).

that there has been no significant changes in this parameter after the game in comparison with before that (Figure
5).
3.6. The impact of Fifa 2015 computer game on
changes in the brain waves
The impact of the game on brain waves changes was
also evaluated. The EEG signals were collected during
playing the game (FIFA 2015) using EMOTIV system
in 14 channels. The signals were then analyzed using
the EEGLAB. The period of 2s in the normal condition
(Figure 6) and the same period during the high activity
condition (Figure 7) were analyzed. These conditions
have been taken from the movies taken during playing
the game based on the face of the subjects. As it is shown

The results have been summarized in Table 1. The average and the standard deviation of the power for the two
conditions have been reported in this table. The average
and the standard deviation of the power for the two conditions have been reported in this table for 14 recorded
channels using the Emotive system.

4. Discussion
Depending on the type of game (action-adventure, horror, strategy, entertaining), computer games utilizes dynamic images and exciting sounds to present a thrilling
world to people eager for excitement and this appeal is
what takes them to a whimsical world where they can
think of themselves as heroes and centers of the world
around them (Bartholow, Bushman, & Sestir, 2006; Feng
et al., 2007; Masson et al., 2011; Tamamiya et al., 2014).
Studies in this field indicate that playing action video
games (VGP) type can affect the visual short-term memory, spatial cognition, multitasking and some aspects of
executive functioning (Boot, Kramer, Simons, Fabiani,
& Gratton, 2008; Mishra, Bavelier, & Gazzaley, 2012).
In the present study we used Fifa 2015 game. A comparison of the amount of cortisol before and after the game

in players of Fifa 2015 showed a statistically significant
decrease in cortisol levels after the game in comparison
with before that (Figure 1). Investigations showed that
the initial stress increases mental abilities such as attention and processing speed and ability for decision-making, unlike chronic stress that impairs mental ability (S.
J. Lupien & Lepage, 2001; McEwen & Morrison, 2013).
On the other hand, short-term stress leads to a sense of
competition and excitement associated with the complex
amygdala function of the emotion. On the other hand,
the central amygdala as the brain stem controller, controls emotional behavior and physiological responses
such as neuroendocrine and autonomic responses such as
the HPA axis are activated before the game and plasma
cortisol concentration goes up. The activity increases the
amount of saliva cortisol. Studies have shown that stress
hormones particularly cortisol can reduce the inter-cellular connection in the forebrain, mainly prefrontal cortex,
in long term and also hippocampus and reduces the decision-making skill and short-term memory. This decrease
of activity leads to disruptions in decision-making system and amygdala activity and increases the probability
of anti-social behavior such as fear, anger and other abnormalities (Davis & Granger, 2009; Nater & Rohleder,
2009). Hence, measuring the amount of this hormone can
show the activity level of system resulting from different kinds of games. In the present study, the increase in
saliva cortisol concentration before the game is probably

198

related to the stress-emotion system of the players before
the game (Feinstein et al., 2011; Nater & Rohleder, 2009)
such that the amount of cortisol after the end of the game
is reduced significantly (Figure 1).
Functional and structural changes in the human amygdala have been reported in a wide variety of conditions
which include mental disorders, stress disorder, anxiety
disorder (PTSD, fear and paranoia), depression, schizophrenia, and autism. Studies have also shown that stress
system activity causes sympathetic (or parasympathetic)
responses in the person (Feinstein et al., 2011; Nater &
Rohleder, 2009). One of these responses is the increase
in the secretion of the enzyme in saliva (salivary alphaamylase). This reaction occurs rapidly and its effect are
showed within a few minutes. Therefore, the increased
concentration of salivary alpha-amylase enzyme is
known as a non-invasive biological index for measuring
the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. This enzyme is also a valuable tool for the study of stress as studies have shown that the levels of these enzymes vary in
response to acute and chronic stress. This increase occurs
as the adrenergic system activity increases in the salivary
glands (Davis & Granger, 2009; S. J. Lupien et al., 2005).
PASAT test is the test that is frequently used by “neuropsychologists” to assess patients’ consciousness processing. This is a tool to test the “immediate memory” and
“attention” in which the “stimulus” is presented through

Basic and Clinical

visual or auditory ways. PASAT test was first used in
1974 by Gronwall and Sampson simultaneously with the
publication of the research on the effects of brain damage
on the speed of information processing in the brain (Tombaugh, 2006). PASAT test was designed to assess the effects of brain damage on cognitive function of the brain in
patients with a wide variety of neurological - psychological syndromes. The impact of computer games on public
mental health (number of correct answers in PASAT test)
before and after playing showed that the number of correct answers before and after the game does not convey
a significant change, and therefore people’s mental health
during this game did not undergo specific and significant
changes (Figure 2).

that the response speed in people has increased significantly after the game in comparison with before the game
(Figure 3).
In addition to the role of emotion, scientists consider
amygdala as a part of the brain that is involved in regulating a variety of cognitive functions such as attention,
perception and explicit memory. The cognitive functions
mentioned above are mediated by amygdala processing of the external stimulation of the mediate emotions,
then the output of the amygdala leads to the release of
hormones in blood through the stimulation of hippocampus, frontal cortex and finally the hypothalamus and the
activation of hypothalamic-pituitary -adrenal stress axis.
These hormones move toward the brain and attach to the
neurons in the amygdala and finally connect with the
hippocampus and improve the explicit memory (Hanif,
2013; LaBar & Cabeza, 2006; Smeets, Otgaar, Candel,
& Wolf, 2008).

Public mental health is one of the symptoms of correct
mental functioning in people and reflects the correct relationship between various parts of the nervous system
associated with cognitive functions such as memory,
learning, and the fluent verbal ability. Since these relations are crucial for a nervous system to function in coordination with each other in a programmed manner, any
factor which may disrupt or reduce this relationship, can
affect the output of the nervous system (here the correct
answers to questions) (McEwen & Morrison, 2013; Tombaugh, 2006). The influence of computer games on the
response speed from PASAT test in this section shows

In the study also the response speed increases as it is
closely connected to short-term memory. The impact of
computer games on the sustained attention that is depicted by the longest chain of correct answers in PASAT
test is also studied. Results in this section shows that
sustained attention at individuals after the game has increased in comparison with before the game, but this was

not a statistically significant change (Figure 4). Making
a decision is the result of an active memory to perform
brain processing and processes that are used to maintain
and manipulate information in short term. This memory
activates for a short time, focuses our attention on a specific topic, removes irrelevant information and leads us to
a decision. Active memory deficiency causes disruption
in efficiency, learning calculations and solving complex
problems. Active memory is also essential to control attention (Boot et al., 2008; Tang & Posner, 2009).
The results of the latest PASAT test that used the longest
chain of wrong answers as a symbol of mental fatigue
shows that there was not a significant change in people
after the game in comparison with before the game (Figure 5). Increasing the number of wrong answers does not
mean that the brain was not able to collect exact and acceptable answers (Tombaugh, 2006). One of the explanations for this inability could be that due to the existence
of underlying stresses, the ability of the brain based on
hippocampus function reduces (S. J. Lupien & Lepage,
2001; McEwen, de Leon, Lupien, & Meaney, 1999). In
previous research it has been determined that being at the
presence of stress weakens the ability to make decisions
in animal or human models and disrupt different types
of memory (S. J. Lupien, et al., 2005; Maheu, Joober, &
Lupien, 2005). Therefore, it can be stated that in the present study, mental fatigue after the game does not have a
negative effect on brain function (Figure 5).

evaluated. The results showed that during high activity
when the subjects played games, the power of the EEG
signals in most of the channels in lower frequency bands
increased. The high activity during playing the game decreased the power of the EEG in lower frequencies in oc-
