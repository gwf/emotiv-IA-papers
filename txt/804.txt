New technological advances of the 20th and 21st Centuries provide several new
opportunities for engineers in the future. Modern engineering methods feasible by these
new technical solutions, however, cannot meet expectations in all fields and situations
without adequate knowledge and competence. Spreading new and modern engineering
methods as well as acquiring new applications is a crucial issue in education. In brain
research, which is one of the most significant research areas of the past decades, many new
results and meters have appeared that could be used in engineering methods, too. Based on
brain activity observation, new meters open up new horizons in engineering applications.
Electroencephalogram-based brain activity observation processes are very promising and
have been used in several engineering research primarily for implementation of control
tasks. In this paper, an EEG-based engineering research work is demonstrated, which
supports the acquirement of practical knowledge and can measure cognitive ability with a
device capable of brain activity observation. In the engineering research task, a braincomputer interface (BCI) had to be developed for the measurement of the average level of
attention. The results of the BCI have been compared and contrasted to the results of two
tests applied in cognitive psychology, the PEBL Continuous Performance Test (pCPT) and
the PEBL Test of Attentional Vigilance (pTOAV). It can be stated that the results of the
procession developed in this research and the results of the pCPT and the pTOAV tests are
in correlation.

Introduction

With the continuous development of IT systems, new opportunities have also
become available in human-computer interaction. These human-machine interface
systems have appeared in many applications and research areas, basically called
the field of cognitive infocommunications (CogInfoCom). CogInfoCom, involves

the speechability, communication, linguistic and behavioural interaction analysis,
face and gesture recognition, brain-computer interface (BCI), human cognitive
interface – virtual and real avatars dealing with the complex mixture of human and
artificial cognitive capabilities in human computer interaction processes [48-63].
The socio-cognitive ICT field includes collective knowledge, cognitive networks
and their intelligent capabilities. Education and learning are closely related to this
area, the CogInfoCom based learning abilities investigating capabilities for
learning through modern informatics-based education, the educoaching including
education through online collaborative systems and virtual reality solutions for
example [64-80]. The human computer interaction processes including
CogInfoCom aided engineering also cover this area, the industrial applications of
CogInfoCom including production engineering, production management, the
cognitive control contains theoretical solutions based on or targeting cognitive and
other human body related processes, cognitive robotics and autonomous mental
development [81-90].
Owing to research in cognitive neuroscience, several specific functions of brain
activity are known, but to deeply understand the basic physiology of the brain and
nervous system several revolutionary developments are now affecting this
research [1]. Understanding the operation of the brain is of great importance in
measuring and interpreting brain waves. The electrical and magnetic phenomena
of the neural functions can be observed during brain operation by
electrophysiology [2]. The most common device for the electrophysiological
observation of the neural functioning of the brain is electroencephalography,
which is used for observation and registration of brain electrical signals generated
by brain activity [3]. EEG signals are mostly processed by the quantitative EEG
(QEEG) method, where the frequency spectrum of the EEG signals is observed
[4].
The EEG-based observation methods are used in several clinical and
psychological examinations [3]. Brain Laboratories at New York University
Medical Center have already published a computer-assisted differential diagnosis
of brain dysfunctions in 1988 [5]. In this research, a computer analysis-based
QEEG signal processing was used, which is a highly sensitive way to give specific
interpretation of measurement results and can evaluate human
electroencephalography, [6]. In the nineties, the primary use of QEEG in clinical
practice included organicity detection, diagnoses of discriminant functions and
epileptic source localization. [7] The earliest psychiatric use of EEG was imaging
human cortical brain activity, but other application possibilities of the EEG have
diagnosed the Attention Deficit Disorder [8], Learning Disability [9], sleep
disorders, Alzheimer's disease [10] and stroke [11], for example. Attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been researched to characterize and
quantify the main characteristics of this disease for decades. [8]
Measuring electroencephalogram (EEG) activity requires complex, expensive,
intimidating and immovable equipment. As a result of continuous development in

– 226 –

recent years, new, mobile EEG biosensor-based embedded devices are available
for new entertainment applications, cognitive infocommunications [25] or
educational purpose [36-46]. In these applications, the connection between brain
activity observed by the EEG and the induced function is effectuated by a braincomputer interface (BCI) [12]. The latest brain-computer interfaces applied with
biosensors, and modern signal processing units have become cheaper and mobile
because of their simple structure, while their accuracy is similar to that of the
clinical EEG devices [12, 13]. This technology is mainly used for solving control
tasks in engineering research, for example robot [14], helicopter [15], car [16] or
prostheses [30] control.
The paper is organised into five sections. Section II describes the primary
objectives of the EEG-based engineering research, the theoretical background of
the EEG-based measurement method and the connection between brainwaves and
attention. Section III presents the main steps of designing a computer-based EEG
system, in this case, an attention level measurement system. The detailed
implementation is described in Section III as well. In Section IV, the evaluation of
the BCI-based attention level test is compared to the results of two
neuropsychological attention tests, the PEBL Continuous Performance Test
(pCPT) and the PEBL Test of Attentional Vigilance (pTOAV). In Section V, the
main conclusions are drawn.

2.1

The EEG-based Engineering Research
The EEG Measurement and Brain Waves

Electrical activity in the brain and the electrical signals resulting from ionic
current flows within neurons can be measured by the EEG method placing a
sensor on the scalp [17], [18]. There are millions of neurons in the brain and each
of these neurons generate a minimal electric voltage field. The aggregated
amplitude of these electrical signals typically ranges from about 1 uV to 100 uV in
case of a healthy adult, and these messages can be detected and recorded on the
scalp [17], [18].
Patterns and frequencies of these emitted analogue electrical signals are typical in
different brain activities. The brain signals are commonly referred to as brain
waves and their frequency spectrum are typical in different mental states [19] and
can be readily determined by digital signal processors. Several new EEG-based
headsets can detect these signals, for example, NeuroSky [20] or Emotive [21].
The strength of different brain wave types can be calculated by FFT (Fast Fourier
Transform) algorithm, which is a mathematical method used in EEG analysis to

– 227 –

J. Katona et al.

investigate the composition of an EEG signal. In this way, the frequency
distributions (as a spectrum of brain waves) can be observed by using FFT
algorithm after filtering, for example Kalman filters [47]. The spectrum of brain
waves is very sensitive to the mental and emotional states of the brain, so this
attribute is used to monitor mental activity [19]. Table 1 below contains the
commonly-recognized brain wave frequencies, which are generated by different
types of brain activity [22].

A NeuroSky EEG-based MindWave Headset

NeuroSky has been developing EEG-based measuring devices for years with the
co-operation of some universities, for example, Stanford University, Carnegie
Mellon University, University of Washington, University of Wollongong and
Trinity College [23]. Measured and processed data provided by a NeuroSky’s
device has been compared and evaluated with the Biopac system, in which
traditional, wet electrodes are used widely in medical examinations and research
[24]. The power spectra in the 1-50 Hz range were observed based on the
measurement data provided by the NeuroSky’s and Biopac device, which is the
frequency spectrum of specific brain waves. According to the validating results,
the correlation factor between the power spectra provided by the two devices is
larger than 0.7, and this means that results produced by the two devices are nearly
identical [13]. The MindWave EEG headset (Figure 1) is a lightweight, portable
device with wireless communication supporting Windows and Mac Operating
Systems [24]. It uses only one AAA battery, and the device can run 6-8 hours. The
main parameters of this device are [24]:
 Weighs 90 g;
 30 mW rated power;
 50 mW max power;
 2420 – 2471 GHz RF frequency with 10 m range;
 57600 Baud;
 1 mV pk-pk EEG maximum signal input range;
 12 bits ADC resolution with a 512 Hz sampling rate;
 1 Hz calculation rate.

The Attention Level and Brain Waves

The connection between attention and brain waves was observed in the 1970s, and
an EEG-based attention analyser was patented [26]. The method of attention
measurement is based on the FFT spectrum intensity examination of brain waves
[20]. From the observations, it could be claimed that the components of brain
waves, the amplitude of alpha brain waves is rather low, while in the inattentive
state it is high [26]. For examination of attention, the Frontopolar1 (Fp1)
measuring position is the most suitable [27] which is located on the frontal lobe
such as MindWave EEG headset uses. The difference in alteration of brain waves
is the base of the patented attention analyser. Several parameters of brain signals
can be determined with digital signal processing algorithms. Power spectra could
be calculated using discrete Fourier-transformation (DFT) algorithm and based on
the resulting brain wave intensity, results can be evaluated [28]. Using the FFT on
EEG signals, the intensity of brain waves and the level of attention can be
determined, which is higher when the spectrum of Beta activity is stronger and
Alfa is weaker, according to Table 1.

The BCI Software

Brain signals are measured by EEG technology – measuring, digitalization,
screening of voltage variation resulted from electrical activity of the brain – and
during partial evaluation, BCI systems supply processed information. [33], [34].
With the consumption of new information, we can operate other applications and
instruments. The BCI system accomplishes a sort of connection between the

following viewpoints need to be taken into consideration [29]:

the application directed by the BCI.

The whole of the effectiveness of the usage and the user's contentment determines
the ISO 9241-210 (2010) with the use of the product. The efficiency determined in
international standard shows how precisely individuals can fulfill the appointed
purpose with their usage. The effort and time invested by users determine
effectiveness. The contentment of an individual depends on convenience,
efficiency and satisfaction according to user's expectations. [31]
The purposes of interface integration in brain computers are summarized in the

service of appropriate responses and representation for user to carry out
appointed function with assistance of application’s graphic user interface.

Different structural alternatives and possible limits of the forming system have to
be taken into consideration during brain computer interface design. During the
planning process, various solutions were needed to search and analyze for the
emerging problems and validation was applied. For the end of the planning
process, only those valid tests were needed to work out which refer to the
implementation.

3.1

The Design of BCI the Software

As a first step, a valid and logical design had to be worked out that represents well
the operation of the system and writes down its main process readily transparent.
Figure 2 illustrates well one possible solution to the problem. The flowchart
represents how the whole system communicates interactively with the user. To
read files supplied by the EEG headset, a serial communication was needed,
where the control of the appropriate work of the port is prominently essential.
After setting the port successfully, the program starts a different thread to process
file packages, which arrive from the headset: validating values in packages,
appropriate processing of file packages and representing proper and processed
items in file packages. The creation of the class diagram from UML’s static
diagram is based on logical diagram, as a well-planned and specified class
diagram makes the implementation task easier. The execution of the software

– 230 –

Acta Polytechnica Hungarica

Vol. 15, No. 3, 2018

implementation of two classes is necessary; its object samples process the data
arriving from the headset and represents it on the computer screen in the form of a
column graph. Furthermore, the implementation of two partial classes is needed;
its objects are responsible for visual appearance and case variation of different
graphical items. With the use of the logical and the permanent models, one of the
most significant design tasks is the planning of the transition and co-operation of
the status of the variable object. As several dynamic models are used in UML
language, we used the so-called sequence diagram. Besides the static and the
dynamic point of system view, it was essential to design the application from the
aspect of user case of the system because with this we can easily measure the
system function and behaviour with appointing characters and tasks from the user
aspects.

The Implementation of the BCI Software

The software has been implemented in Microsoft Visual Studio. The development
environment supports object-oriented high-level C# programming language,
which is the most widely used language in Windows operating system
programming. The program was divided into two main sections: data-processing
and view. The data-processing component performs reading, conversion and
processing of the data which arrive from the headset through serial connection,
and the view part fulfills the representation of the appointed signs with the help of
column and timing diagram (Figure 3). The serial port parametrization menu is
visible in the window bottom left corner. After the setup of the serial port, a popup
window appears to open the selected port. After successfully establishing the
communication channel, we can start the measurement of brain activity by
clicking "Reading Waves" button. The calculated and average values of the
recorded data are visible in column graph form. The time functions of a given
measurement can be examined in the top right part.

The Tests and Examination Results of Attention
Level Meter Compared to pCPT and pTOAV
The pCPT and pTOAV Neuroscience Tests

The pCPT and pTOAV neuroscience tests are used to evaluate the attention level
meter [35]. The pCPT test (Figure 4) examines concentration during a test that
runs for a relatively long time, for approximately 14 minutes. During this
examination, 360 letters are shown to the test subjects who should press the space
key if the shown letters are not X. Having finished the pCPT, the software
evaluates the results immediately, and it is available in report format.

Figure 4
Test subjects must respond by pressing the space bar to all stimuli except the X.

T.O.V.A. was first used by psychologists and neurologists to examine attention
deficit disorder, but it is also used in non-medical areas, such as schools or
rehabilitation programs. The pTOAV test is a simple implementation of T.O.V.A.;
it is a concentration/alertness test, which only examines the reaction to visual
stimuli. As with Conner's continuous performance test, target gems are
distinguished for this type of test as well as anti-target stimuli. In the test, a black
square is located in a white square on the computer screen, randomly on either the
bottom or top parts (Figure 5). Test participants should press the space key if the
black square is located on the top.

A black square appears randomly on the screen in a white square. Test subjects must respond only to
targets when the black square is on the top. For the first half of the test, targets are rare; for the second
half, they are frequent.

4.2

The Test Subjects

34 high school students participated in this experiment. All test subjects were
healthy, with no history of psychiatric or neurological disorders. The age range
was 14-18, the average age was 16.2, range ±1.4; 47% of girls.

4.3

The Statistical Analysis

The statistical evaluation of data in the case of the PEBL tests was made by an
interval scale, while the SPCI 23 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) program pack was
used on an ordinal scale for the BCI, therefore, non-parametric tests were applied
for BCI results, and parametric tests were carried out with PEBL test results if
parametric test conditions were fulfilled. Regarding the differences between the
morning and afternoon results of PEBL tests, where test subjects are independent
of each other, the pattern of results followed a normal distribution. Therefore, a
related-pattern t-test was applied where the effect size was determined by Cohen
d-value. As during the PEBL tests, the average attention registered by the BCI
system was measured on an ordinal scale, Wilcoxon-signed rank test was carried
out. In the case of the used statistical tests, the p<0.05 value was found to be
significant.

4.4

The Results and Discussion

During the first quantitative experiment, dependency relationship and collected
metric data were examined and correlation was analysed. The next step was to
find connections with the help of an independent and a dependent variable
between pCPT/BCI and pTOAV/BCI attention level results.

Comparing the pCPT and BCI Results

The correlations and relationships between the obtained test results and BCI
system results can be estimated and evaluated on the whole sample, i.e., on all test
participants. To observe the correlation between individual measurements,
Spearman's correlation was used, because the BCI variable was determined on an
ordinal scale type, and our data was monotonic. It can be concluded that the pCPT
and BCI results obtained in the morning show a significant positive correlation
(Figure 6a), where rs=0.693 p<0.01 (2-tailed). Moreover, the pCPT and BCI
results obtained in the afternoon also show a significant positive correlation
(Figure 6b), where rs=0.710 p<0.01 (2-tailed).
Furthermore, a significant difference was found between morning
(M±SD=315.34±5.19; D(32)=0.133 p=0.158) and afternoon (M±SD=308.81±5.92;
D(32)=0.105 p=0.200) t(31)=16.16 p<0.01 (2-tailed), d=1.17 pCPT test results.
According to the Wilcoxon signed-rank test results, a significant difference (T=0
Z=-4.94 p<0.01 (2-tailed) r = 0.87 was observed in pCPT and BCI results, in the
morning (Mdn=52.05) and afternoon (Mdn=45.05) hours.

As seen in Figure 7a, medians differ in comparison to the bottom and top
quartiles, so it generally appears that test subjects achieved better results in the
morning hours, in addition, data grouping is rather above the median, while the
results were weaker in the afternoon hours from all aspects and data disposition
from the median was even smoother. Figure 7b shows that medians differ in
comparison to the bottom and top quartiles and it generally appears that test
subjects achieved higher level of attention in the morning hours. In the afternoon
hours, the tests show decreased level of attention and data grouping from the
median was smoother, too.

Another aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the pTOAV
test and the average level of attention provided by the BCI system. The obtained

correlation because in case of the BCI variable, ordinal scale type was determined,
and our data were monotonic.
The results show that pTOAV and BCI results obtained in the morning have a
significant positive correlation (Figure 8a), where rs=0.73 p<0.01 (2-tailed). The
pTOAV and BCI results in the afternoon also show a significant positive
correlation (Figure 8b), where rs=0.72 p<0.01 (2-tailed).

Moreover, pTOAV tests in the morning (M±SD=629.16±6.93; D(32)=0.105
p=0.200) and afternoon (M±SD=619.84±5.92; D(32)=0.095 p=0.200) have a
significant difference t(31)=13.29 p<0.01 (2-tailed), d=1.29
The results of the Wilcoxon-signed rank tests show that the difference between the
average level of attention measured by the BCI system was significant (T=0 Z=4.94 p<0.01 (2-tailed) r=0.87) in the morning (Mdn=52.55) and afternoon
(Mdn=47.20) hours.
According to Figure 9a medians differ in comparison to the bottom and top
quartiles and it can be seen that in the morning, the test subjects achieved a higher
level of attention and data disposition of the afternoon results is more noticeable
below the median.
Figure 9b shows that the medians differ in comparison to the bottom and top
quartiles and it can be seen that in the morning, the BCI system recorded higher
level of attention, while the data disposition is smoothly distributed around the
median. In the afternoon hours, the results of the BCI system and the pTOAV test
have decreased, and distribution from the median was even smoother.

Conclusions
With regard to the advantages of the processed BCI system, it is visible based on
the test results that relatively high, above 0.6 correlation is shown between the test
results of both the morning and the afternoon hours, and it shows a strong
relationship between the observed characteristics. This means that comparing to
the applied test-based measuring methods of the examination of attention; the
implemented BCI system could be an alternative method to investigate attention
level.
