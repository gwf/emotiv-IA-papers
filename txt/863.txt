Sleep quality is important, especially given the considerable number of sleep-related
pathologies. The distribution of sleep stages is a highly effective and objective way of
quantifying sleep quality. As a standard multi-channel recording used in the study of sleep,
polysomnography (PSG) is a widely used diagnostic scheme in sleep medicine. However,
the standard process of sleep clinical test, including PSG recording and manual scoring,
is complex, uncomfortable, and time-consuming. This process is difficult to implement
when taking the whole PSG measurements at home for general healthcare purposes.
This work presents a novel sleep stage classification system, based on features from
the two forehead EEG channels FP1 and FP2. By recording EEG from forehead, where
there is no hair, the proposed system can monitor physiological changes during sleep
in a more practical way than previous systems. Through a headband or self-adhesive
technology, the necessary sensors can be applied easily by users at home. Analysis results
demonstrate that classification performance of the proposed system overcomes the
individual differences between different participants in terms of automatically classifying
sleep stages. Additionally, the proposed sleep stage classification system can identify
kernel sleep features extracted from forehead EEG, which are closely related with sleep
clinician’s expert knowledge. Moreover, forehead EEG features are classified into five
sleep stages by using the relevance vector machine. In a leave-one-subject-out cross
validation analysis, we found our system to correctly classify five sleep stages at an
average accuracy of 76.7 ± 4.0 (SD) % [average kappa 0.68 ± 0.06 (SD)]. Importantly,
the proposed sleep stage classification system using forehead EEG features is a viable
alternative for measuring EEG signals at home easily and conveniently to evaluate sleep
quality reliably, ultimately improving public healthcare.

INTRODUCTION
Monitoring human physiology during sleep is essential for individual health. Sleep is increasingly viewed as playing an important
role in restitution (Akerstedt et al., 2007). As an important aspect
of well-being, sleep quality is closely related to overall quality of
life, life satisfaction, secretion of the stress hormone, cortisol, and
inadequate immunity (Gallagher et al., 2010). Evaluating of sleep
quality is especially relevant, owing to a considerable number of
pathologies linked to the sleep. Sleep stages are also recorded for
clinical diagnosis and the treatment of sleep disorders. Sleep quality is most closely related to the distribution of depth of sleep;
indeed, sufficient sleep quality must reach adequate deep sleep.
The depth of sleep is characterized by different cortical electrical activities. Several sleep stages can be defined by variations of
cortical electrical activities and other physiological signals, i.e.,

muscle activity and eye movement. According to Rechtschaffen
and Kales rules (R&K rules), sleep stage can be segmented into
wakefulness, movement time (MT), REM and sleep stages S1,
S2, S3, and S4 based on features of EEG, EOG, and EMG (Kales
and Rechtschaffen, 1968). In addition to modifying the standard
guidelines for sleep classification by R&K, the American Academy
of Sleep Medicine (AASM) developed guidelines for terminology,
recording method, and scoring rules for sleep-related phenomena (Iber et al., 2007). In the AASM guidelines, sleep stages S1 to
S4 are referred to as NREM stage 1 (N1), NREM stage2 (N2), and
NREM stage3 (N3). N3 reflects slow wave sleep (SWS, R&K stages
S3 + S4).
As the reference standard clinical multi-parametric system,
polysomnography (PSG) (Holland et al., 1974) is used in sleep
studies to define the different physiological sleep stages and

diagnose many sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, restless
legs syndrome, rapid eye movement (REM) behavior disorder,
parasomnias, and sleep apnea. The PSG system requires a minimum of 11 channels, including electroencephalogram (EEG),
electromyogram (EMG), electrooculogram (EOG), oxygen saturation (SpO2), and electrocardiogram (ECG). However, assessing
a complete PSG has several limitations. First, PSG is not a portable
device and typically placed in a sleep center, which is unfamiliar
environment for patients. Second, PSG requires many physiological electrodes and wires placed on the scalp and body, possibly
affecting their sleep further. Third, a standard sleep diagnosis in
clinical practice is time-consuming and expensive (Zoubek et al.,
2007). These processes are monotonous, and time consuming
and unproductive. A simpler EEG acquisition and analysis system must be operable by patients for home use, as well as solve
current PSG problems.
Recent studies have adopted bioelectrical signals (i.e., EEG,
ECG, EMG, and EOG signals), which allow subjects to operate
at home in order to develop sleep stage scoring methods, while
attempting to obtain results similar to those of experts involved
in visual scoring (Park et al., 2000; Anderer et al., 2005; Tian
and Liu, 2005; Berthomier et al., 2007; Doroshenkov et al., 2007;
Virkkala et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2009; Güneş et al., 2010; Jo
et al., 2010; Yιlmaz et al., 2010; Eiseman et al., 2011). The classification structure of most of sleep stage classifications consists
of feature extraction and classification schemes. The references
differ from each other not only in the presented feature extractions and the corresponding classification schemes, but also in
different bioelectrical signals used, such as EEG, EOG, or ECG.
Feature extraction is a highly efficient means of achieving a satisfactory classification performance in order to develop a sleep
stage classification approach. Certainly, if extracted features can
achieve a high separability in distinguishing between different
classes, classifiers can perform satisfactorily. In recent studies
(Berthomier et al., 2007; Doroshenkov et al., 2007; Güneş et al.,
2010; Jo et al., 2010), the signal process procedure regards an
entire 30-s epoch as a processing unit to extract spectral and temporal information directly. The specific characteristics of sleep
stages are smoothened easily within an entire 30-s signal process.
For instance, the k-complex and sleep spindle only appear suddenly in a short period with 0.5–1.5 s in a 30-s epoch. Therefore,
a short-term signals process should be incorporated when a
developing feature extraction approach. Compared with EEG
measurement, despite overcoming the hair problem, EOG and
ECG still have certain limitations. For instance, EOG and ECG
requires adhesive electrode pads, and the locations of EOG (or
ECG) and corresponding amplifier are divergent from each other.
A subject’s sleep position may interfere with the wire, thereby
degrading the EOG and ECG signal quality. Despite the persistent
hair and conductive gel problems associated with EEG measurement, recent developments to resolve these problems include a
headband and portable EEG recording device, as well as a dry
polymer foam electrode for long-term EEG measurement (Lin
et al., 2008, 2011). Additionally, physiological characteristics during sleep are more easily identified by EEG than by EOG and
ECG, explaining why the former is preferred when classifying
sleep stages.

Sleep stage classification via forehead EEGs

Berthomier et al. (2007) assessed an automatic sleep scoring
software (ASSEEGA). The system adopts a 3-step procedure for
automatic sleep scoring, based on a single EEG channel. In classifying five sleep stages, the agreements between ASSEEGA and
two expert manual scorings are 76.0% (kappa = 0.67) and 78.2%
(kappa = 0.69). Although highly promising for diagnostic and
automatic ambulant scoring. This system still requires 2 bipolar
channels (Cz-Pz, international 10–20 standard system), which are
located at the back of the skull and hair site, conductive gel, and
a laboratory EEG recording device to achieve a high resolution.
The connection between hair and conductive gel, and subject’s
sleep position may also worsen the EEG quality, further lowering
the estimation accuracy of the sleep stage.
This work develops a sleep stage classification system via
two forehead EEGs, i.e., FP1 and FP2. FP1 and FP2 EEG measurements have the following advantages: non-hairy site EEG
recording is performed; the two signals also contain eye movement information; and the system is easily self-adhesive and
self-applicable for homecare users and long-term monitoring.
The proposed classification system incorporates a novel feature
extraction approach, capable of extracting spectral information
while considering manual scoring rules. The proposed system
further incorporates the relevance vector machine (RVM) as the
basic classifier. Importantly, the proposed system provides preliminary results for diagnostic assistance and automatic ambulant
scoring to determine whether a patient requires detailed testing
with the PSG system in a sleep laboratory. Furthermore, the headband and portable EEG device as well as dry EEG electrodes (Lin
et al., 2008, 2011) greatly facilitate the implementation of the proposed system in homecare setting for long-term monitoring of
sleep quality, as well as for large-scale population studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SUBJECTS AND DATA ACQUISITION

Ten right-handed adults participated in our study (ten males;
mean age 24 ± 6 years). None of the participants reported having
a history of psychological disorders. Following a detailed explanation of the experimental procedure, all participants completed
a consent form before the experiment. To avoid influences from
other external factors, all subjects were instructed not to consume
alcoholic or caffeinated drinks or sleeping pills beforehand. The
experiments were performed at night (10:00 p.m.–08:00 a.m.). All
experimental procedures received approval from the local ethics
committee (Institutional Review Board of Taipei Veterans General
Hospital, Taiwan).
The sleep PSG signals were recorded with a sampling rate
of 128 Hz using Sandman Elite (Sandman Elite, Nellcor Puritan
Bennett [Melville] Ltd., Kanata, Ontario, Canada) (Figure 1D).
All subjects were required to sleep for a single night in the sleep
laboratory of National Chiao-Tung University (Figure 1A) and
wore all PSG electrodes during sleep. The complete PSG recording
contains six channels EEG (F3, F4, C3, C4, O1, O2), two channels
EOG, chin EMG, leg EMG, airflow signals, lead-II ECG, oximetry,
nasal pressure, snoring sounding, and body position (Figure 1B).
Forehead EEG signals from FP1 and FP2 were also recorded by
the same PSG system simultaneously (Figure 1C). All of the EEG
signals were re-referenced to the opposite lateral mastoids (A1

and A2). The contact impedance between all of the electrodes
and scalp was controlled to be lower than 5 k. No adjustment or
artificial removal techniques were applied to the data. Each data
set contained 5–8 h of forehead EEG signals and complete PSG
signals.
SLEEP STAGE MANUAL SCORING

Sleep data for each subject were scored visually based on the manual scoring rules of AASM to five sleep stages by an experienced
sleep expert. The five sleep stages are W, N1, N2, N3, and REM,
and each 30 s sequential epochs was assigned to a sleep stage.
Table 1 summarizes the distribution of sleep stage belonging to
subjects.
PROPOSED AUTOMATIC SLEEP STAGES CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

Visual manual scoring often identifies the different sleep stages
based on EEG activities. While attempting to incorporate the
advantages of EEG activities of manual scoring rule, this work
presents a novel sleep stage classification system embedded with
a feature extraction approach, which is inspired by the sleep

clinician’s expert knowledge in translating two forehead EEG signals to the relevant features, and relevance vector machine (RVM)
in order to classify the sleep stages automatically. Figure 2 displays
the flowchart of the proposed sleep stage classification system. As
per AASM recommendations, a 30-s sequential EEG recording
should function as a unit to assign a sleep stage. In the preprocessing step, all of the 30-s EEG signals are filtered by a band pass
filter within 0.5–50 Hz. The following sections described the proposed feature extraction, normalization, and RVM procedures in
detail. After RVM, the input 30-s EEG recording assigns a sleep
stage. When the recording procedure stops, the final sleep stage
results for the whole recording can be estimated.
Feature extraction

Previous studies extracted frequency-domain features by fast
Fourier transform (FFT) within the entire30-s signals. However,
the previous studies regarded the entire 30-s signals as a processing unit to directly extract frequency-domain features by FFT.
Under this circumstance, the specific characteristics of power
spectrum density of 30 s signals are easily smoothened, and the
corresponding sleep spectral activities are lost, when the characteristics of sleep appear only at a short period in the time signals.
The entire 30 s signals contain a significant amount of information, and the spectral information obtained from FFT directly
cannot accurately reflect the advantages of the manual scoring
rules. To resolve this problem, this work presents a novel feature extraction approach to extract spectral features by short-time
Fourier transform and manual scoring knowledge, which retain
the properties of temporal manual scoring rules and represent
the spectral response in power spectral density. According to the
manual scoring rules of AASM (Iber et al., 2007), the EEG activities include alpha rhythm, theta rhythm, K complex, sleep spindle
and slow waves. For instance, the epoch is scored the wakefulness
when more than 50% of the epoch has alpha (8–12 Hz) rhythm.
The epoch is scored as the N1 when alpha rhythm is attenuated
and replaced by low amplitude, predominantly theta (5–7 Hz)
rhythm for more than 50% of the epoch. The epoch is scored
as N2 when the K complex or sleep spindle (12–14 Hz) occurs

with the theta background rhythm. The epoch is scored as N3
when more than 20% of the epoch has high amplitude slow wave
activity. If a single epoch contains 2 or more stages, the stage that
contains the greatest portion of the epoch is assigned.
Figure 3 describes the proposed feature extraction for each
30-s EEG signal. Following the expert knowledge of manual scoring rules, the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a 1 s
Hamming window overlapped with a 0.5 s window is used rather
than using FFT within the entire 30-s signals (Figure 3A). Power
spectrum densities (PSD) of fifty-nine segments are calculated
after using STFT in entire 30-s EEG signals. Following STFT, the
PSD of each segment is normalized to avoid individual differences. PSD of each frequency bin of each segment is divided by
the total PSD of each segment (Figure 3B). Proposed features are
identified in the following definition.
The slow wave activity (0.5–2 Hz and amplitude of greater
than 75 microvolt) refers to an important index to score N3, and
the ratio of slow wave activity has to be greater than 20% visually. Therefore, PSD in lower delta (0.5–2 Hz, denoted as ↓Delta,
Figure 3C) is chosen to represent the feature of the slow wave
activity. Moreover, the average PSDs of the lower delta of upper
and lower 80% of 59 segments are viewed as the features of slow
wave activity.
As the most important characteristics in visually identifying
N2, and K complex and sleep spindle occur spontaneously and
roughly every two epochs. K complex is a well-delineated negative sharp wave in EEG immediately followed by a positive
component with total duration at least 0.5 s; in addition, sleep
spindles are oscillations of sigma (12–14 Hz) with duration of
0.5–1.5 s. Hence, the maximum PSD of sigma band among 59
segments and the average PSD of sigma band of the remaining
58 segments is represented as features of sleep spindle. Moreover,
the maximum PSD of delta band (1–4 Hz) among 59 segments
and the average PSD of delta band of the remaining 58 segments
are represented as features of K complex (Figure 3C).

Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neuroprosthetics

While tending to appear during drowsy, meditative, and
sleep onset, theta rhythm scores the epoch as N1, N2, and
REM. The average PSDs of theta of upper and lower 50%
of 59 segments represent the features of light sleep (N1+N2)
(Figure 3C).
Movement time, normal resting waking consciousness and
wakeful relaxation with eyes closed are accompanied by gamma
rhythm (30–50 Hz), beta rhythm (15–30 Hz) and alpha rhythm,
respectively. Experts score the epoch as stage wakefulness, when
beta and alpha rhythm appear more than 50% of epoch.
Thus, the average PSDs of beta and alpha band of upper
and lower 50% of 59 segments are represented as the features of stage wakefulness. Movement time stage is mainly
accompanied by muscle artifacts obscuring the EEG for more
half an epoch. Hence, the average PSD of gamma of 59 segments is represented as the feature of movement time stage
(Figure 3C).
As mentioned earlier, for FP1 and FP2 EEG channels, sixteen
features are extracted, respectively. Two features are extracted as
↓delta activity; two features are extracted as delta activity; two
features are extracted as theta activity; two features are extracted
as alpha activity; two features are extracted as sigma activity; two
features are extracted as beta activity; and one feature is extracted
as gamma activity.
For investigating the influence of the proposed feature
extraction approach, the conventional PSD feature extraction approach is compared with the proposed one. The conventional PSD feature extraction approach is calculated by
the fast Fourier transformation directly for each entire 30s EEG signal. Notably, this work does not further consider
the feasibility of integrating the frequency bins to the specific frequency bands such as delta and theta. The PSD activity ranging from 1 to 50 Hz is used here as input features.
Also, for FP1 and FP2 EEG channel, fifty features are extracted,
respectively.

Relevance vector machine

SYSTEM PERFORMANCE VALIDATION

Relevance vector machine (RVM) is a learning algorithm based
on Bayesian framework and support vector machine (SVM)
(Tipping, 2001). RVM has a form similar to that of SVM; they
differ in the measurement between binary classes. SVM learns the
maximal distance of margins between binary classes, while RVM
learns the maximal probability of margins between binary classes.
In contrast with RVM, SVM has the following disadvantages: the
number of support vectors (SVs) grows with an increasing number of training patterns; the overfitting problem may occur if SVM
selects too many SVs; the decision value is derived from the hyperplane function of SVM in the feature space, making its formation
as the probability degree impossible; and the penalty parameter of
SVM must be set; this penalty parameter significantly influences
the classification results. This parameter is generally determined
by the cross-validation approach. Further details of RVM and
SVM can be found in Tipping (2001).

To illustrate the efficiency of the proposed feature extraction
approach, this work evaluates the separability of different feature extraction approaches by using the Fisher criteria (Fukunaga,
1990). Two Fisher criteria are expressed as follow:

www.frontiersin.org

J1 =

tr(Sb )
tr(Sw )

J 2 = tr(S−1
w Sb)
where Sb and Sw denote the between-class and within-class scatter
matrix, and tr (A) refers to the trace of square matrix A. A larger
J 1 and J 2 imply a larger separability of the presented features in
feature space.
Under the extracted feature approaches, this work compares
the classification performances of linear discriminate analysis

Huang et al.

(LDA) (Fukunaga, 1990), k-nearest neighbor classifier (k-NN)
(Fukunaga, 1990), SVM (Chang and Lin, 2011; Li et al., 2012),
and RVM (Tipping, 2001). Several trials are performed for kNN, in which the value of k is varied from 1 to 20, to determine
the value that maximizes the accuracy. The selected k in k-NN
is 13. For simplicity, this work only adopts the linear kernel for
SVM and RVM to evaluate how the proposed feature approach
influences. From the perspective of SVM and RVM, the advantage of SVM and RVM is the extension of feature space by the
kernel function. The feature space of SVM and RVM is implicitly
defined by the kernel function. Hence, two popular kernel functions, i.e., linear and radial basis function (RBF) kernel of SVM
and RVM, are more closely examined. As for the SVM, a penalty
parameter (also called slack variable) C of SVM, in which the
trade-off between the margin and the size of the slack variables
in this experiment is controlled, is determined by a grid search
within given set {0.1, 0.5, 1, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 1500}.
Here, the C selected from the grid search is 50. A grid search is also
performed to derive the proper parameter of RBF kernel within
a set {0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 1000}. Here,
the selected parameter of RBF for both SVM and RVM is 0.5.The
multiclass strategy in SVM and RVM adopted in this work is a
one-against-all strategy (Bottou et al., 1994; Li et al., 2012).
In this work, the sleep PSG data of ten subjects are collected. To evaluate the performance of the proposed classification
system, the classification performance is evaluated using leaveone-subject-out cross validation (LOSO). Implementing LOSO
involves taking the data from one subject as the testing set and the
data from other remaining subjects as the training set; the same
procedure is repeated until all subjects are including in the testing
set. As is well known, the training data and the testing data should
be independent of each other. Restated, the testing information
should not be used in the training step. The k-fold cross validation
approach is the conventional means of evaluating the classification performance. However, this approach cannot ensure that the
training data and testing data are independent. Because the training data and testing data are from different subjects, the training
data and the testing data in LOSO are independent. Hence, LOSO
is less subjective than the normally adopted k-fold cross validation
within the single subject.
This system performance is evaluated using three valid indices,
i.e., overall accuracy, sensitivity, and Cohen’s kappa coefficient.
Overall accuracy refers to proximity of measurement results to the
actual value and precision to the repeatability or reproducibility
of the measurement. Sensitivity is performed to reflect the ability to identify positive results for each class. Cohen’s kappa is
a statistical measure of inter-rater agreement or inter-annotator
agreement for qualitative (categorical) items (Cohen, 1960). As is
generally assumed this measurement is more robust than simple
percent agreement calculation since kappa takes into account the
agreement occurring coincidentally.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Performance of the proposed feature extraction approach is evaluated by using Fisher criteria, i.e., J 1 and J 2 , to demonstrate the
separability. Table 2 lists the values of J 1 and J 2 . Both of J 1 and
J 2 in the proposed feature extraction approach are larger than

the conventional PSD feature extraction approach, implying that
the proposed feature extraction approach has a better separability
than conventional PSD feature extraction approach. For illustration, principal component analysis (PCA, Fukunaga, 1990) is
performed to decompose the proposed extracted features and
conventional frequency PSD features to first two principal components (PCs), respectively. Figures 4A,B show the scatter plot of
the first two PCs from the conventional PSD feature extraction
approach and the proposed feature extraction approach, respectively. These figures clearly reveal that the spatial distribution of
the proposed feature extraction in PC space has the better scatter
distribution than that of the conventional PSD feature extraction
one. The scatter plot of the proposed feature extraction approach
presents the scatter points from different groups, i.e., wakefulness, N2, N3, and REM, which are leading ones in their own
industries. However, the conventional PSD feature extraction
approach can not verify this observation. Most data points from
the conventional PSD feature extraction approach are mixing in
PC space. Additionally, regardless of in which feature extraction
approaches, most of the data points of N1overlap with N2, and
REM, because the EEG characteristics of N1 in manual scoring
rules closely resemble that of N2, REM.
Figure 5 and Table 3 display the average classification performances from two feature extraction approaches and four
classifiers. The performances, both in terms of overall accuracy
and kappa coefficient, of the proposed feature extraction more
significantly improves (p < 0.05, paired t-test) than the conventional frequency PSD features. The proposed feature extraction
approach has an approximately 20% greater increase in overall
accuracy and kappa coefficient than the conventional frequency
PSD extraction approach. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient can reach as high as 76.7 and 68.2% by RVM, respectively.

features of the conventional extracted PSD with those of the
proposed approach. According to the above results and Fisher criteria, the proposed feature extraction approach has a better separability than the conventional PSD feature extraction approach,
as also verified by the classification performance in Table 3. The
rise in classification performance depends on the proposed feature extraction approach while considering the manual scoring
criteria. In particular, the kappa coefficient in the proposed feature extraction approach is increasing significant implying that
the proposed method improves both the overall performance
of classification and its accuracy for each class with a balance
trade-off. For instance, the sensitivity for wakefulness in LDA
(conventional PSD feature extraction approach) is 95.7%, i.e., the
highest sensitivity of a single class; however, the sensitivity of the
other classes is extremely low.
Table 4 and Figure 6 summarize the results of SVM and RVM
with RBF kernel and liner kernel. The optimum result is RVM
with linear kernel, in which the accuracy and kappa can reach

www.frontiersin.org

76.7% and 0.68, respectively. Next, RVM and SVM are compared, revealing a significant increase in both linear kernel function (over accuracy, p = 0.012, paired t-test; kappa coefficient,
p = 0.024, paired t-test) and RBF kernel function (over accuracy, p = 0.033, paired t-test; kappa coefficient, p = 0.069, paired
t-test). Two kernel functions in SVM and RVM are also compared.
Applying the RBF kernel in SVM has a ∼1.5% improvement in
overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. However, it does not reach
a statistically significant level (over accuracy, p = 0.071, paired ttest; kappa coefficient, p = 0.089, paired t-test). In terms of RVM,
applying the RBF kernel in RVM also does not reach a statistically
significant level (over accuracy, p = 0.582, paired t-test; kappa
coefficient, p = 0.658, paired t-test).
In terms of SVM, although the number of SVs is normally less
than the training patterns, the number of SVs grows larger with an
increasing number of training patterns. However, the overfitting
problem occasionally occurs in SVM with a large number of SVs.
The number of SVs of SVM is generally larger than that of RVs

in RVM. The number of support vectors (SVs) is also compared
with that of relevance vectors (RVs). RVM is characterized by the
fewer number of RVs than that of SVs in SVM.
Fewer RVs can avert the overfitting problem. For each subject, the training patterns come from the remained nine subjects,
explaining the variation in the number of training patterns. This
work adopts the one-against-all multiclass strategy, which is a
“one class vs. all others” method, for SVM and RVM. Therefore,
the train population is considered from all classes. In the oneagainst-all multiclass strategy, SVM and RVM train individual
decision hyperplane (formula of SVs or RVs and corresponding
coefficients) for each class. From ten subjects, the mean of number of train pattern is 7425.9, and standard deviation is 131.4.
Table 5 shows the mean of number of SVs and RVs from linear kernel and RBF kernel. Regardless of whether linear kernel
or RBF kernel is adopted, the number of RVs is significantly less
than the number of SVs (all p-values are less than 0.0001 with
Student’s t-test). Although the number of trained SVs is in the
thousands, the number of trained RVs only ranges less than several hundred, thus representing a significant difference between
RVs and SVs.
To investigating how class imbalance prior influences the classification performance, this work describes the confusion matrix
between the proposed sleep classification approach, in which
RVM is used with linear kernel function and expert manual
scoring (Table 6). The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient,
as computed from this confusion matrix, are 76.7% and 0.69,
respectively. Table 6 and the performance in Table 4 demonstrate
that the reported validation indices are not biased.
Figure 7 shows the estimation results, based on the proposed
classification approach and the manual scoring results for one
subject (S07). The top plot is the distribution of the estimated
sleep stages from proposed classification, and the below plot is the
distribution of the sleep stages from the sleep expert. For this subject, the accuracy between the proposed classification approach
and the sleep expert’s scoring is 82.5% (kappa = 0.77). The proposed classification approach with only forehead EEG can reach a
quite similar performance with the sleep expert.

DISCUSSION
Based on the scatter plot and Fisher criteria, this work demonstrates that the proposed feature extraction approach can achieve
a better separability than the conventional PSD feature extraction approach. The classification performance also demonstrates
that the proposed feature extraction approach is more effective

than the conventional PSD feature extraction approach in distinguishing between different sleep stages. The proposed feature
extraction approach is considered with the sleep stage manual scoring knowledge. Additionally, time-frequency analysis is
performed to extract the spectral activities in a short segment
window signal not whole 30-s signals. The proposed feature
extraction approach characterizes not only by its temporal information of manual scoring, but also by its spectral response. Sleep
experts distinguish between the different sleep stages by counting
the rhythm and the amplitude of EEG visually by per-second EEG
signals from whole 30-s signals. The proposed feature extraction
approach applies the short-time Fourier transform with a one second window and overlap 0.5 s. Also, the PSD activity is transferred
from STFT to several specific frequency bands, e.g., low delta
(1–2 Hz), delta (1–4 Hz), theta (5–7 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), sigma
(12–14 Hz), beta (15–30 Hz), and gamma (30–50 Hz). With the
entire 30-s data, 59 segments are extracted. To overcome the individual differences, the PSD of each segment is divided by the total
sum of the PSD of each segment. Hence, the PSD activity in the
proposed feature extraction approach is the proportion response
of PSD. Based on the expert’s manual scoring knowledge, several features are extracted from these specific frequency bands of
59 segments. STFT can achieve the spectral activity of specific
frequency response which may be more or less resonant in the
spectral space. For instance, the sleep spindle is a sigma rhythm
lasting from 0.5 to 1 s, and occurring suddenly. If the fast Fourier
transfer is applied to a N2 epoch with one spindle of whole 30s EEG signals, the specific sigma frequency response cannot be
identified clearly. The principal spectral response might be a background spectral response, i.e., theta spectral response, and the
amplitude of PSD within the sigma band might be extremely low.
However, STFT can separate the signals into several segments
in order to calculate the PSD individually. If the spindle occurs,
STFT can enhance the corresponding spectral activity more than
that of FFT with whole signals. Moreover, in addition, to using
STFT to transfer the signals to PSD, this work also proposes sorted

www.frontiersin.org

power activities to extract the manual rules’ properties for the
specific frequency spectral activity as the sleep features. The corresponding specific frequency spectral activities are extracted by
following the manual scoring rules. For instance, the maximum
power of sorted sigma power activities can represent the feature
of the sleep spindle. If the current epoch is N2, the value of the
maximum power of sorted sigma power activities is higher than
that of the maximum power of sorted sigma power activities from
the other sleep stages.
The value extracted by average PSDs of alpha and beta of
upper 50% of 59 segments from wake stage is higher than that
of sleep. The value extracted by the average PSDs of the slow wave
of upper 80% of 59 segments from N3 stage is higher than that
of other stages. Similarly, the other features from different frequency bands can represent the other sleep stages. Berthomier
et al. (2007) characterized several contrast functions, which are
feature extraction approaches, as defined by the EEG power activity calculating from whole epoch directly. Although Berthomier
et al. (2007) considered the baseline resting EEG frequency of each
individual to adjust the spectral criteria, the extracted features
were still calculated from the whole 30-s EEG signals. The specific
frequency activity still diminishes, when the frequency activity is
calculated within the whole 30-s signals. Hence, the proposed feature extraction approach is a more effective means of extracting
the sleep characteristics.
SVM has recently achieved higher empirical accuracy and
better generalization capabilities than other standard supervised
classifiers (Fatma Guler and Ubeyli, 2007; Lotte et al., 2007; Xu
et al., 2009; Li et al., 2012). However, as mentioned earlier, SVM
is limited in the number of SVs and the selection of penalty
parameter. The penalty parameter in SVM is adjusts the generalization capability. RVM is an extension algorithm that eliminates
the disadvantages of SVM. SVM learns the maximal distance of
margins between binary classes while, in contrast, RVM learns
the maximal probability of margins by exploiting a probabilistic
Bayesian learning framework between binary classes. The penalty

September 2014 | Volume 8 | Article 263 | 9

Huang et al.

parameter in SVM is usually determined by the cross-validation
approach. The chosen penalty parameter depends on the setting
candidate set. Too much training time is expended when selecting
the penalty parameter in SVM, if the setting candidate set has
a wide range. The chosen penalty parameter is a local optimum parameter, depending on the setting candidate set, not
the global optimum parameter. The chosen penalty parameter,
which affects the number of SVs, incurs the overfitting problem
in training phase. RVM can estimate penalty parameters automatically. Additionally, RVM can improve the problem in the
number of SVs. Accounting to our results, the number of SVs
can significantly decrease in the number of RVs; the classification performance can also be improved by RVM. Hence, the
RVM is applied as the basic classifier in the proposed sleep stage
classification system.
The detection of N1 is always the most problematic aspect of
the sleep stages (Virkkala et al., 2007). Identifying a significant
feature in EEG that could separate N1 from wakefulness, N2, and
REM, is rather difficult because N1 is a transition phase in the
changes of wakefulness and other sleep stages (Virkkala et al.,
2007). The sleep EEG characteristics of N1 closely resemble those
of N2, REM, and resting wakefulness. Our results demonstrate
that the extracted features from PSDs in N1 resemble to N2, REM
and resting wakefulness (Figure 4). Moreover, many epochs of N1
are misclassified to Wake, N2, and REM (Table 6), explaining the
difficulty in automatically identifying N1 by a computer. Efforts
are underway in our laboratory to address this problem.
Recent efforts have attempted to develop a more reliable sleep
system with few bioelectrical channels, i.e., one EEG, one ECG,
or two EOGs, in order to simplify the complex PSG inspection
(Berthomier et al., 2007; Virkkala et al., 2007; Yιlmaz et al., 2010).
Virkkala et al. (2007) devised an automatic sleep stage classification via two EOGs. The performances (Virkkala et al., 2007)
with 5 sleep stages are 72.5% epoch-to-epoch agreement and 0.63
Cohen’s kappa, and the sensitivity of Wake, REM, N1, N2, and
SWS are 74.10, 72.7, 39.2, 79.1, and 73%, respectively. Although
this work applies two channel signals, the FP1 and FP2 EEGs,
which can reflect the eye movement, have more information in
classifying sleep stages. Hence, both the characteristics of sleep
EEG and eye movement are captured. Additionally, the proposed
classification system accurately estimates sleep stages. Yιlmaz
et al. (2010) presented a sleep stage and obstructive apneic epoch
classification via single-lead ECG. The performances (Yιlmaz
et al., 2010) with 6 sleep stages are 73.1% epoch-to-epoch agreement, and the sensitivities of Wake, REM, NREM1, NREM
2,NREM 3, and NREM 4 are 95.6, 84.9, 98.5, 61.8, 94.3, and
87.4%, respectively.
Performance of the classification (Yιlmaz et al., 2010) is satisfactory, even the sensitivity of NREM 1 (98.5%), which is the most
difficult sleep stage to be identified automatically (Berthomier
et al., 2007; Virkkala et al., 2007). Yιlmaz et al. (2010) applied the
10-fold cross validation within a single subject data, which totally
separates a subject’s self-data as the training data and also as the
testing data. For instance, for a subject with total 800 epochs,
partitioning produces 10 subsets with 80 epochs each. Therefore,
the training set (720 epochs) and testing set (80 epochs) include
totally separate sets of data. The training set and testing set

originate from a specific subject. Moreover, the properties of
training and testing data resemble each other, the corresponding
with the over-fitting problem in training phase. Notably, attempting to use a subject-dependence model by a specific subject in
order to classify another independent dataset may cause worst
results. LOSO cross-validation is a more objective evaluation
approach for machine learning experiment involving human subjects to allow for subject-to-subject variation. The testing data are
subject-independent to the training data. Hence, the performance
evaluation by LOSO is more effective and reliable than k-fold
cross validation in developing a general model involving human
subjects. As mentioned earlier, the right and left EOG signals are
recorded by placing two electrodes at the nasal and temporal canthal regions of the eye, in which one electrode is attached to the
middle of the forehead as ground electrode while another electrode is placed on the left mastoid M1 as reference electrode.
ECG signals are acquired by two electrodes in a modified leads
II configuration (Malmivuo and Plonsey, 1995). The positive and
negative leads are placed on the fourth inter costal space and the
left of the sternum. Also, both of the EOGs and ECG still require
adhesive electrode pads, and the locations of EOGs (or ECG)
and corresponding amplifier diverge from each other. The sleep
position may affect the recording quality of physiological signals.
Berthomier et al. (2007) presented an ASSEEGA based on an EEG
channel. In terms of performance, the proposed sleep stage classification system is nearly equivalent to the ASSEEGA. However,
ASSEEGA still requires 2 bipolar channels (Cz-Pz, international
10–20 standard system), making it infeasible for homecare applications. First, the position of electrodes is not easily identified,
self-adhesive, and self-applicable for a self-operating user. Second,
the conductive gel and a laboratory EEG recording device are still
required in the recording signals. Although several portable EEG
devices (e.g., Mindo-4S (Mindo, Hsinchu, Taiwan), MindWave
Mobile (NeuroSky, CA, USA), and Emotiv epoc headset (Emotiv,
Eveleigh NSW, Australia), as well as dry sensors) can overcome
this problem, the comfort of dry electrodes of Cz and Pz is still a
major challenge during sleep.
Anderer et al. (2005) recently developed and optimized an
automatic classification system based on a central EEG channel,
two EOG channels and a chin EMG channel; in addition, the final
validation of overall epoch-by-epoch agreement is 80% (Cohen’s
kappa is 0.72) between the proposed automatic classification system and human expert scoring. Obviously, the data-rich recordings have more information, e.g., sleep brain electrical activity
from EEG, muscle activity from EMG, and eye movement from
EOGs. Such information-rich physiological data provide more
important indices to classify the difference between REM and
light sleep, i.e., the rapid eye movement and the lowest mandible
muscle activity. Hence, the data-rich recording can achieve an
excellent performance. Although the performance in this work is
not equivalent to that of the classification system (Anderer et al.,
2005), the proposed system attempts to reduce the number of full
PSG signals to fewer physiological channels, as well as further
classify the sleep stages effectively. Therefore, the proposed system uses forehead EEGs, i.e., FP1 and FP2. FP1 and FP2 have
the following advantages: the physiological data include information from sleep brain electrical activity and eye movement; and

adopting the forehead EEGs makes it feasible for self-application
for a self-operating user. With the portable EEG device (Lin et al.,
2008) and dry sensors (Lin et al., 2011), home-based users can
easily to wear the EEG headband to record the sleep forehead
EEG signals by self-applicable. Furthermore, we can further analyze with the collected data can be analyzed further, even leading
to the development of on-line sleep stage classification software.
Despite its contributions, this work has certain limitations.
The collected data are limited to young and healthy study participants. The sleep stages in normal person are expected to
diverge from the norm and to be more heterogeneous than those
of older or younger, healthy individuals or patients. The sleep
stage manual scoring rules are based on counting the rhythm
of different frequency activities. The proposed system attempts
to comply with this criterion in order to extract the sleep features. The system also uses STFT as temporal and visual rules,
i.e., processing the signal within one-second window, and further
extracts features by PSDs representing different rhythms of different frequency activities. This system is created by the healthy
subjects, and does not have obvious evidence to verify that the
proposed sleep stage classification is reliable in older individuals
or patients. Therefore, efforts are underway in our laboratory to
study the relation between patients and the proposed sleep stage
classification system.

CONCLUSION
This work presents a novel sleep stage classification system, consisting of a novel feature extraction method and RVM classifier,
based on only two forehead EEG channels. Also, the classification
performance is consistent with the sleep clinician’s expert knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of using the
proposed system as the preliminary screening results for a preclinical diagnosis to assist clinicians in making a diagnosis (rather
having a depth testing with PSG system in a sleep laboratory) to
reduce time for the procedure. Moreover, the proposed system
only uses two forehead EEG signals, allowing us to apply the wearable and wireless EEG recording device (Lin et al., 2008; Liao et al.,
2012) [e.g., Mindo-4S (Mindo, Hsinchu, Taiwan) and MindWave
Mobile (NeuroSky, CA, USA)] in order to record the patient’s
EEG signals at home. Importantly, the proposed system provides
an easier way for large population studies, long-term sleep monitoring, and home-based daily care. Efforts are underway in our
laboratory to integrate the wearable and wireless EEG recording
device and the proposed sleep stage classification system. As an
important aspect of performance, the automatic artifact detection
might be a possible way to improve the efficacy of the proposed
system. Hence, the efficacy of the automatic artifact detection
should be considered in the proposed system in the future work.
