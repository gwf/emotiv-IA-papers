Abstract
The main mechanism of market economy – competition – has forced
organizations to search factors influencing advertising effectiveness. Relying on
the maxim “unseen – unsold”, the visual impression of advertising becomes
crucially important. First visual impressions do often influence mid- and longterm human behavior and are influenced by factors such as context or visual
complexity. The aim of this research is to determine the effect of visual layout
complexity of advertising on consumers’ attentional resources engaged in
processing an advertisement as well as evaluation and classification time of the
advertisement regarding different levels of visual layout complexity. To reach
the aim of the article, P300 event-related brain potential is recorded and
analyzed. In the context of visual complexity of advertising, recording and
analysis of P300 component reveal whether high visual advertising complexity
leads to more attentional resources engaged in processing an advertisement as
well as whether advertisement with high visual complexity is evaluated and
classified slower. Moreover, questionnaire research is provided for the
participants in order to assess the differences in attitudes towards the brands
advertised with different layout complexity levels. As a research results, the
effect of visual advertising complexity on cognitive processes such as attention
allocation and its influence on the attitude toward the object is revealed and the
managerial implications for creating effective advertising are provided.

Introduction
The impact of advertising complexity on consumers’ attention has been discussed
among marketing scholars and practitioners for a long time. Moreover, it is broadly
recognized that different kinds of complexity exist. The three primary frameworks where
advertising complexity is analyzed are verbal, visual, and informational. Each framework
represents the amount of elements (characterized as a part of that particular framework)
within an advertisement. E.g., Pieters, Wedel, and Batra (2010) analyzed visual
complexity which was characterized by feature complexity (advertisements are visually
complex when they contain dense perceptual features) and design complexity
(advertisements are visually complex when they have an elaborate creative design);
Michailidou, Harper, and Bechhofer (2008) proposed that visual complexity reflects
design complexity of an advertisement; other scholars provided a research of advertising
complexity in a verbal framework analyzing syntactic complexity (Lowrey, 1992, 1998)
and lexical complexity (Chamblee et al., 1993); Phillips and McQuarrie (2004) described
advertising complexity in terms of rhetoric complexity; Putrevu, Tan, and Lord (2004)
provided a term of informational complexity.
The object of this research is the layout complexity of print advertising. According to
Chamblee and Sandler (1992), although layouts represent the culmination of all the
components that make up print advertisements, minimal attention has been paid to the
effectiveness of the various styles of layouts. Paradoxically, the topic of the effectiveness
of advertising layouts is rarely analyzed in scientific literature. El-daly (2011) emphasizes
that many studies of advertising do separate out components of ads, concentrate on one
or a few and ignore the others. The research provided by Rayner, Miller and Rotello
(2008) revealed that the nature of the ad per se can influence where viewers look in ads.
Therefore, it might be hypothesized that advertising layout is an important predictor of
advertising effectiveness. The aim of this research is to determine the effect of visual
layout complexity of advertising on consumers’ attentional resources engaged in
processing an advertisement as well as evaluation and classification time of the
advertisement regarding different levels of visual layout complexity.
Stating that the number of arrangements and patterns of print advertising are almost
endless, Nelson (1975) proposes that it is possible to fit most print-medium
advertisements into ten basic categories or layouts: Mondrian / Grid; Picture-window /
Ayer No.1; Copy-Heavy; Frame; Circus; Multipanel; Silhouette; Big-Type; Rebus; and
Alphabet-Inspired layout. According to Chamblee and Sandler (1992), one of the most
popular and most widely used layouts is Picture-window (also called Ayer No.1). In
Picture-window layout, the main attention is given to a picture or illustration, leaving the
headline, subhead, and copy unimportant (Feasley, Stuart, 1987). According to Ong
(2010), this kind of layout is very effective nowadays, because reading has lost its appeal
to a new generation that is fed on a diet of fast-paced multimedia technologies. We
consider this type of layout as the most suitable to provide a simple message due to visual
advertising simplicity (low complexity). At the other extreme we found to be the Circus
layout which generally deals with a larger-than-average number of components (Feasley,
Stuart, 1987). According to Nelson (1975), it slows down the reader, making things more
difficult to take in; and in the process of working through the disorder, the reader may

remember more. Therefore, we consider this type of layout as the most suitable for our
research by reflecting visual advertising complexity.

Research methodology
Experimental stimuli
Event-related brain potentials (further – ERPs) are regarded as neural manifestations
of specific psychological functions (Fabiani, Gratton, & Federmeier, 2007). The specific
P300 ERP (large positively-deflected peak occurring approximately 300 to 800 ms
following stimulus onset (Pontifex, Hillman, & Polich, 2009)) provides information about
the neural activity of fundamental cognitive operations (Ma et al., 2008). The amplitude
of P300 is proportional to the amount of attentional resources engaged in processing a
given stimulus and it is not influenced by factors related to response selection or
execution; moreover, P300 varies with the emotional value of the stimulus to the
perceiver (Gray et al., 2004). P300 peak latency is proportional to stimulus evaluation
timing (Polich, 2007). Hence, in the context of the advertising complexity, recording and
analysis of P300 component can reveal whether a complex layout in the advertisement
leads to more attentional resources being engaged in processing an advertisement as well
as whether a complex layout generates higher emotional value to consumers.
Additionally, latter analysis can reveal whether a complex layout in the advertisement is
evaluated and classified slower than a simple one. Therefore, in this research authors
analyze the differences of P300 peak amplitude and latency regarding different
advertising complexity levels in the context of convenience product category,
hypothesizing that those different advertising complexity levels lead to different amounts
of attentional resources engaged in processing the advertisement and different
advertisements’ evaluation and classification times.
P300 is usually assessed using an “oddball paradigm” (see Gray et al., 2004; Fabiani,
Gratton, & Federmeier, 2007; Polich, 2007; Mayaud et al., 2013). As such it was applied
for this research. The visual stimuli consisted of two target stimuli (probability = 0.05 for
each), distractor stimulus (probability = 0.1) and standard stimulus (probability = 0.8).
For the target stimuli, advertisements of well-known convenience product category
brands reflecting different levels of layout complexity (representing Picture-window and
Circus layouts) were chosen. The choice of these particular advertisements was based on
such prevailing characteristics of layouts: copy (no copy / heavy copy); color (up to 3
colors / plenty of colors); spokesperson (no / yes); brand (positioned in the same place;
similar visual complexity levels). Six experts of marketing and advertising participated
in the procedure and validated the correct choice of the target stimuli.
All visual stimuli were presented in the center of computer screen (resolution:
1366x768) for 631 trials totally. The stimuli were presented in a randomly generated order
for the participants using Matlab R2012b software package. The stimulus was always
presented at fixation for 800 ms each; the interstimulus (black screen) time interval varied
from 0.3 s to 1.5 s in random order (average interstimulus interval – 900 ms).

Recording electroencephalographic activity and analysis of P300 ERP
EMOTIV EPOC EEG headset was used for the experiment. Based on Mayaud et al.
(2013), it was setup front-side-back. The 14 single-use felt pads were located at the
extended 10/20 locations Fp1, F7, CP5, T7, P7, P3, PO3, Fp2, F8, T8, CP6, P8, P4, and
PO4. The EMOTIV headset uses a common mode sense (CMS) electrode at F4 location
and a driven right leg (DRL) electrode at F3 that can be related to the ground and reference
in more traditional acquisition systems. Electrode impedances were controlled visually
with the EMOTIV control panel and EMOTIV TestBench. Signals are internally digitized
at 2048 Hz (16-bit) and subsequently low pass filtered (43 Hz) and down sampled to 128
Hz before transmission to the acquisition module.
All of the participants were instructed to respond to the target photo (both target
stimulus) by pressing on a response box with their right index finger and not to respond
otherwise. The distance between computer screen and the participants’ eyes was about 30
centimeters and the screen was centered in their line of sight. Markers that indicated the
precise stimulus onset time were sent from the Matlab R2012b software to the EMOTIV
TestBench v1.5.1.2 software via com0com serial port.
The recorded EEG file of each participant was imported from the EMOTIV TestBench
to the add-in programs of the Matlab R2012b software: EEGLAB 13.14.3b (Delorme, &
Makeig, 2004) and ERPLAB 4.0.3.1 (Lopez-Calderon, & Luck, 2014). In these programs
data pre-processing was done by applying independent component analysis (ICA) to
remove blink and saccadic movement artefacts from the EEG data, an automatic EEG
artefact detector based on the joint use of spatial and temporal features – ADJUST 1.1
and band pass filter (0.1 – 30 Hz). Data were organized in epochs corresponding to
intervals [-100; 800] ms, centered on a stimuli onset. Epochs were rejected according to
± 100 μV threshold criterion. In total, 28 ± 3 epochs per participant (n = 30) per target
stimuli were obtained. A time window of 100 ms before stimuli onset was used as
baseline. Averaged ERPs were generated for every participant and for every electrode for
each stimulus. Latencies and amplitudes of P300 were compared for the different stimuli
by applying Student T Test in IBM SPSS Statistics V.20 software package. As the
EMOTIV EPOC EEG headset does not contain midline electrodes, the analysis was
provided for the electrodes P3 and P4.

Questionnaire research
References In order to determine the differences between brand recall, advertising
recognition, and attitudes toward the brand and advertisement as well as purchase
intentions regarding the brand advertised in advertisements with different complexity
levels, questionnaire research was provided. The questionnaire contained three parts:
1) The section containing questions concerning brand recall and advertising
recognition;
2) Attitudes toward the brands, advertisements, and purchase intentions:
Attitudes were measured on a semantic differential scale by 11 items each:

• attitude toward the brand – low quality / high quality, unlikable / likable, bad / good,
worthless / valuable, unattractive / attractive, not advisable to choose / advisable to
choose, not distinctive / distinctive, useless / useful, inferior / superior, negative / positive,
ineffective / effective;
• attitude toward the advertisement – dull / interesting, unpleasant / pleasant, not
important / important, unattractive / attractive, inappropriate / appropriate, not useful /
useful, not informative / informative, not persuasive / persuasive, irrelevant / relevant,
ineffective / effective, bad / good.
A 7-point Likert scale was used to measure purchase intentions regarding the specific
brand provided in the advertisement with specific complexity level;
3) Socio-demographic data (age and gender).
Consequently, the hypotheses were made that the levels of brand recall and advertising
recognition are different for the advertisements with different layout complexity levels;
and that the attitudes toward the brand and advertisement as well as the level of purchase
intentions are different for the advertisements with different complexity levels.
Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses using IBM SPSS Statistics V.20 and
XLSTAT 2014 software packages were provided to assess the differences in attitudes,
recall, recognition, and purchase intentions regarding brands advertised in different
complexity level advertisements.

Participants
The EEG experiment was continued until there were 30 appropriate sets of
participants’ data. Consequently, 34 participants participated in the experiment and 30
participants’ (12 female) data was used for the analysis. All of the participants were righthanded with normal or normal-to-corrected vision. 26 participants (out of 30) were at the
age group of 18-29 years, 4 participants were 30-39 years.
All of the participants were volunteers and had not been paid for the participation in
the EEG experiment. Before the experiment each of the participants was informed in
detail about the experiment and signed consent forms. The experiment was held in
Lithuania, Vytautas Magnus University, August-October, 2015.
All of the participants of the EEG research completed the questionnaire research.
Further questionnaire research was conducted on university students, using the same
questionnaire given to subjects of the EEG research. Thus, 162 respondent in total
participated in the questionnaire research (37 percent of male, 63 percent of female; 97
percent of respondents were at the age group of 18-29 years, 3 percent of respondents
were at the age group of 30-39 years). Again this research was conducted in Lithuania,
Vytautas Magnus University, August-October, 2015.

Research results
All The grand-averaged amplitudes of P300 component for different advertising
complexity levels (i.e. highest and lowest) in the different parietal channels (P3, P4) are
provided in Table 1. As it can be seen, the amplitude of P300 is a little higher for the
lowest advertising complexity level in channel P3, but in channel P4 it is higher for the
highest advertising complexity level.

It can be seen from the Table 2 that in the channel P3 lower advertising complexity
level elicited larger P300 amplitude than the higher one, but the difference in latter
channel of the amplitude of P300 component regarding those complexity levels is
statistically non-significant. On the other hand, in the channel P4 the highest advertising
complexity level elicited larger P300 amplitude than the lowest one as well and the
difference in latter channel of the amplitude of P300 component regarding those
complexity levels is statistically significant. Thus, the assumption can be made that the
source of P300 event-related potential is in the right hemisphere. Consequently, it could
be stated that the highest advertising layout complexity level leads to more attentional
resources being engaged in processing an advertisement as well as higher emotional value
(positive or negative) to consumers when compared to the lowest advertising layout
complexity level.

The topographic map of the difference of P300 amplitude in the parietal channels
regarding different advertising layout complexity levels (highest – lowest) is provided in
Fig. 1 below, and it substantiates the assumption that the source of P300 event-related
potential is in the right hemisphere, where the highest advertising layout complexity level
elicits statistically significantly larger P300 amplitude than the lowest advertising layout
complexity level.

The grand-averaged latencies of P300 component for different advertising layout
complexity levels (i.e. highest and lowest) in the different parietal channels are provided
in Table 3. The longer latencies of the P300 component in the channel P3 as well as in
the channel P4 are elicited by the highest advertising layout complexity level. As higher
complexity refers to the abundance of elements, meaning the greater the number of items
that must be scanned in short term memory, hence it requires longer processing time
which is reflected in the longer P300 latency.

Differences of the mean P300 latencies regarding advertisements with different
advertising layout complexity levels (high – low complexity) are provided in Table 4. In
both channels (P3 and P4) the difference of P300 latency is statistically significant. This
leads to the conclusion that the speed of processing the advertisement is quicker when
advertisement’s layout complexity level is the lowest.

When analyzing unaided brand recall, it is important to mention that all of the
respondents (100 percent) remembered at least one of the brands that they saw during the
research procedure. Nevertheless, brand advertised in the lowest complexity level
advertisement was the first to come to mind for 90 percent of respondents, while brand
advertised in the highest complexity level advertisement was the first to come to mind
only for 10 percent of respondents (see Table 5). Thus, brand presented in the
advertisement with simple layout creates much deeper recall than the one presented in the
advertisement with complex layout.

To compare aided brand recall and advertising recognition levels regarding different
advertising layout complexity levels, the McNemar test is applied (two dependent
samples; non-normally distributed data with dichotomous variables). As can be seen in
Table 6, aided brand recall is statistically significantly better when brand is presented in
the advertisement with simple layout. Nevertheless, the difference in advertising
recognition regarding advertisements with different layout complexity levels is not
statistically significant.

The analysis of the research results revealed that the more attentional resources are
engaged in processing an advertisement and the higher emotional response is elicited
when the highest advertising layout complexity level is chosen. Moreover, latter
advertising layout complexity level leads to a more positive attitude toward the
advertisement. On the other hand, the analysis of the research results revealed that the
lowest advertising layout complexity level requires shorter processing time, because of
the smaller number of items that must be scanned in short term memory. Furthermore,
the brand presented in the lowest complexity level advertisement is recalled better,
additionally, attitude toward that brand is more positive and purchase intentions of that
brand are higher. Nevertheless, there is no difference in advertising recognition regarding
advertisements with different layout complexity levels.

Discussion and managerial implications
This study contributes to the knowledge advancement in the marketing and advertising
literature and industry in two ways. First, it examines the effect of advertising layout
complexity on consumers’ attention, recall and recognition, attitudes toward the
advertisement and the brand, and purchase intentions. Second, neuromarketing research
methods are applied in this research to explore the effect of advertising layout complexity
on consumers’ cognitive operations.
The results obtained in the current study show that more attentional resources are
engaged in processing an advertisement and higher emotional response is elicited in case
when the highest advertising layout complexity level is chosen. Moreover, higher
advertising layout complexity level leads to a more positive attitude toward the
advertisement. The assumption can be made that more positive attitude toward the
advertisement with the highest complexity level is related to the higher emotional
response elicited by this advertising complexity level (of course assuming that the
emotional value elicited by certain advertisement is positive). On the other hand, the level
of brand recall is very low when brand is presented in the advertisement containing the
highest complexity level. Bearing in mind that brand recall forms attitude toward the
brand, which influences purchase intentions, it is not surprising that attitude toward the
brand presented in the advertisement with the highest complexity level is worse and
purchase intentions of latter brand are lower than of the brand presented in the
advertisement with the lowest complexity level. In contrast, there is no difference in

advertising recognition regarding advertisements with different levels of layout
complexity. The highest level of advertising layout complexity means the greater number
of items that must be scanned in short term memory, thus it requires longer processing
time and considering that attention is in some sense capacity-limited, the brand (one of
the elements) can be left outside the conscious consideration. Consequently, it could be
stated that when the aim of marketing communication is to enhance brand awareness or
to form attitude toward the brand, the highest level of advertising layout complexity is
not appropriate. Subsequently, when consumers’ attitude toward the specific brand is
positive, it is useful to use the highest level of advertising layout complexity, because in
this case the whole advertisement receives more attention and the attitude toward the
advertisement is more positive, suggesting that the advertisement will be seen and liked
(see Fig. 2).
Figure 2 Algorithm for the selection of the level of advertising layout complexity
The lowest advertising layout complexity level requires shorter processing time,

because of the smaller number of items that must be scanned in short term memory and
the assumption can be made that this creates the possibility to better later recall of each
of the elements seen (the lowest advertising layout complexity level implies that there is
no more than few elements in the whole advertisement). Furthermore, the brand presented
in the advertisement with the lowest complexity level is not only recalled better, but also
attitude toward that brand is more positive and purchase intentions for that brand are
higher. Consequently, it could be stated that when the aim of marketing communication
is to enhance brand awareness or to form attitude toward the brand, the lowest level of
advertising layout complexity is appropriate to reach the aim of marketing
communication. Then again, as the attitude toward these advertisements is worse than to
those containing high layout complexities, meaning that advertisements with the lowest
layout complexity level can soon start to be annoying to consumers, it is advisable to
switch to the highest level of advertising layout complexity when the positive attitude
toward the brand is formed.

By following the provided recommendations organizations can improve the chances
of creating successful and effective advertising campaigns.

Conclusions
Consumer attention capturing is one of the relevant topics in recent research of
advertising effectiveness. However, in order for advertising to be considered as effective,
attention capturing is not enough. Brand recall and recognition, attitudes toward the
advertisement and the brand, and purchase intentions have to be assessed as well. This
study contributes to the discussion on the effectiveness of advertising layout complexity
by providing the results that the level of advertising layout complexity has a different
impact on the cognitive processing of advertisements as well as on consumer recall,
recognition, and purchase intentions.
The research results enabled to draw a picture of the strategic usage of advertising
layout complexity: initial usage of the low complexity of advertising layout (Picturewindow layout) helps organizations in creating brand awareness and familiarity; after the
brand gains its position in consumer memory, the higher level of advertising layout
complexity has to be provided (Circus layout) to create an emotional value.
However, due to the highly complex experimental procedure, current research
considered only two forms of advertising layout: simple (Picture-window) and complex
(Circus). In the further researches other advertising layouts have to be tested for their
effectiveness. Moreover, different colour spectrum, different types of advertising
spokesperson, different product categories might be chosen for the researches.
