Abstract
Stress is a major growing concern in our age, adversely impacting individuals
and society. Stress research has a wide range of benefits with the potential to
improve health and wellbeing, personal day-to-day activities, increase work
productivity and benefit society as a whole. This makes it an interesting and
socially beneficial area of research. It motivates objective understanding of how
average individuals respond to events they observe in typical environments
they encounter, which this thesis investigates through artificial intelligence
particularly bio-inspired computing and data mining.
This thesis presents a review of the sensors that show symptoms which
have been used to detect stress and computational modelling of stress. It
discusses non-invasive and unobtrusive sensors for measuring computed
stress. The focus is on sensors that do not impede everyday activities which
could be used to monitor stress levels on a regular basis. Several computational
techniques have been developed previously by others to model stress based on
techniques including machine learning techniques but these are quite simplistic
and inadequate. This thesis presents novel enhanced methods for modelling
stress for classification and prediction using real-world stress data sets.
The main aims for this thesis are to propose and define the concept of
observer stress and develop computational models of observer stress for typical
environments. The environments considered in this thesis are abstract virtual
environments (text), virtual environments (films) and real environments (reallife settings). The research comprised stress data capture for the environments,
multi-sensor signal processing and fusion, and knowledge discovery methods
for the computational models to recognise and predict observer stress.

Abstract
Experiments were designed and conducted to acquire real-world
observer stress data sets for the different environments. The data sets contain
physiological and physical sensor signals of observers and survey reports that
validate stress in the environments. The physiological stress signals in the data
sets include electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic
skin response, blood pressure and the physical signals include eye gaze, pupil
dilation and videos of faces in visible and thermal spectrums.
Observer stress modelling systems were developed using analytics on
the stress data sets. The systems generated stress features from the data and
used these features to develop computational models based on techniques such
as support vector machines and artificial neural networks to capture stress
patterns. Some systems also optimised features using techniques such as
genetic algorithm or correlation based techniques for developing models to
capture better stress patterns for observer stress recognition. Additionally, a
computational stress signal predictor system was developed to model temporal
stress. This system was based on a novel combination of support vector
machine, genetic algorithm and an artificial neural network.
This thesis contributes a significant dimension to computational stress
research. It investigates observer stress, proposes novel computational methods
for stress, models stress with novel stress feature sets, and proposes a model for
a temporal stress measure. The research outcomes provide an objective
understanding on stress levels of observers, and environments based on
observer perceptions. Further research suggested includes investigating models
to manage stress conditions and observer behaviours.

Chapter 1 Introduction
This chapter provides an introduction to the thesis. It presents the motivation
for the proposed research on computational observer stress and identifies the
main research questions and objectives. A schematic diagram is presented to
describe the characteristics and components of a computational model for stress
modelling. The chapter also summarises the organisation of the thesis.

1.1 Motivation
There are ongoing significant changes in technology and its uptake in society
particularly to improve the health and wellbeing of people. A technical
challenge confronting researchers and technology developers is to meet the
escalating demands for approaches to monitor wellbeing to address everyday
unavoidable life pressures and challenges. Stress is a leading threat to people
because the demands imposed by modern lifestyles on people cannot be
satisfactorily controlled. This is a major risk to health and social aspects of life.
In general, stress is a “complex reaction pattern that often has psychological,
cognitive and behavioural components” [1]. It can be used to describe the
physiological and health wear and tear of the body experiencing changing
environments having three main facets – input stimulus, processing and
evaluation, and response [2].
The medical literature indicates that stress, when sufficiently powerful
so that it overcomes defence mechanisms, has a range of severe impacts on
immune and cardiovascular systems on individuals. As stress becomes chronic,
it makes individuals more vulnerable to infections and incurable diseases, and
slows down the body’s immune and recovery processes [3]. Individuals are
continuously exposed to viruses and infectious diseases, which their immune
1

Chapter 1: Introduction
system defeats but will have lower or no capability to do so when the
individual is under stress [4]. In the developed world, stress is becoming the
main cause of cardiovascular diseases and depression [5].
In addition, stress is a major cause of financial burden on society [6].
Statistics in 2005 show that above 75% of visits to medical practitioners in the
United States of America were due to stress-related symptoms [7, 8]. Stress
costs Australian Taxpayers at least $300,000 every day according to a report in
2009 [6]. Several government and non-government organisations (e.g.
International Stress Management Association UK [9], SupportLine [10] and
Lifeline Australia [11]) are established to help individuals deal with stress and
to create awareness of the issues associated with stress, a major problem faced
by the world today.
Stress research has a wide range of potential applications and benefits
including the capacity to improve personal, government and industry
operations. This research has the potential to increase the robustness of military
operations, law enforcements, athlete performance [12], games and education
software, life support systems, learning and increase work productivity [13].
Computer systems using non-invasive techniques that dynamically provide
assessment of stress using human stress response signals have been exploited
to determine stress in fighter pilots [14], but these systems are obtrusive and do
not suit flight operations and behaviour. Some less intrusive systems have been
developed to detect stress in a range of people including car drivers [15-17],
computer users [18], army officers [19, 20], pilots in flight [20, 21], surgeons
[22], and surgical patients [23]. However, the data analysis methods and
models are quite simplistic and have not been shown to scale across different
day-to-day environments.
There is a growing research interest to analyse stress objectively. The
stress research community acknowledges that stress is “too well known and too
little understood at the same time” [2]. The major current focus in stress
research is to determine objective ways to detect stress with minimal obtrusion.

2

1.2 Research Question and Objectives
The variables associated with stress and their modelling come from various
disciplines including signal sourcing, signal processing, data knowledge
discovery, computer science, physiology, and bio-physical analysis making it
multidisciplinary by nature. A range of relevant techniques from various fields
including computer science (e.g. machine learning, data mining), mathematics,
statistics, and hybrid methods have been applied to stress research, which will
be discussed in Chapter 2 of this thesis. These provide a rich hybrid
environment for investigation in the proposed research.

1.2 Research Question and Objectives
Study of stress detection, modelling and management is an important need to
address the major concerns stress poses to the world today and in the future.
This motivates an objective understanding of how average people respond to
events they observe in environments they encounter, which is captured in the
main question for the research of this thesis:
Can observer stress be modelled computationally?
The aim for this thesis is to develop a computational model of stress based on
objective human responses collected from human observers of environments.
The model will be used to recognise and predict stress of a person during an
environment they encounter. The environments will range from abstract virtual
environments (text) through virtual environments (film) to real environments
with real human interactions. Various non-invasive and less or non-obtrusive
sensors and computational techniques will be used to develop computational
models for observers of the environments. The sensors will be used to source
human response signals showing stress symptoms, which this thesis will refer
to as primary stress signals. The signals will include physiological and physical
signals and will be recorded for observers while they see an environment
during data collection. The physiological signals will be captured by electrodes

placed on the human body that are non-invasive (i.e. electrodes that do not
penetrate the body by incision) and less or non-obtrusive (i.e. electrodes that
minimise obstructing natural movement) and the physical signals will be
captured by camera and vision-based sensors. Signal processing, feature
extraction, feature selection and modelling methods will be proposed and
developed to discover stress patterns to recognise and predict observer stress.
A high level architecture of the computational model of observer stress
envisaged is presented in Figure 1.1. The computational model of observer
stress will be a contribution to Human Centred Computing in the
understanding of stress behaviour.
The main objectives towards answering the research question include:
1. Review literature and discuss how stress has been defined and
modelled;
2. Define an objective stress measure;
3. Define observer stress;
4. Collect real-world observer stress data: design and conduct experiments
and record primary stress signals for observers of abstract virtual
environments, virtual environments and real environments;
5. Develop computational models for observer stress for abstract virtual
environments, virtual environments and real environments; and
6. Propose future research from the work presented in this thesis.

conducted to acquire real-world observer stress data for the different
environments. This section presents details on the structure of the thesis.
In order to establish the context of the research, Chapter 1 gives an
introduction and general background for the research in computational stress.
It describes the motivation for computationally modelling observer stress,
which is the purpose for this thesis. A review of the literature in computational
stress research will be presented in Chapter 2 focussing on primary stress
signals and computational techniques for modelling stress. It provides a
detailed background of the research. Chapter 3 presents a definition of
computed stress and describes observer stress using the definition of computed
stress. The architecture of a computational model of observer stress is also
presented in the chapter. The proposed definitions and model architecture are
used to model observer stress in abstract virtual environments (AVEs), virtual
environments (VEs) and real environments (REs) in Chapters 4-6.
Chapter 4 presents computational models of observer stress in AVE. It
proposes observer stress models for independent individuals, individualindependent models, stress feature optimisation methods for observer stress
classification, a hybrid stress feature and model parameter optimisation
method for stress classification and a method to determine optimal time
segments for observer stress detection. The chapter details the stress signal data
collection process that was conducted to obtain a real-world observer stress
data set for AVE. It discusses the performances of the observer stress models on
the data set.
Observer stress computational models for VE are proposed in Chapter 5.
Chapter 5 also analyses primary stress signals sourced using contact sensors
and non-obtrusive sensors for observer stress classification. The analysis
provides a potential for stress analysis for individuals to use in their daily lives
in a non-research context. Real-world stress data sets for VE were collected
which included the primary stress signals used to model observer stress in
Chapter 4 and primary stress signals sourced by non-obtrusive sensors. The

6

1.3 Thesis Organisation
chapter presents the process taken to collect the stress data. The chapter also
proposes video imaging techniques of faces and presents novel stress features
based on videos of faces of observers in the thermal spectrum for observer
stress modelling and analysis.
Chapter 6 proposes computational models of observer stress in RE. The
architectures for the models were adapted from Chapter 5 based on their
performance on stress data for stress classification. The chapter also proposes a
computational stress signal predictor system to estimate a stress signal for
observer stress. The models were tested on real-world observer stress data sets
for RE. The primary stress signals in the data sets collected were based on their
performance in stress classification in Chapter 5, the level of obtrusiveness of
the stress sensors and the potential for the sensors to be ubiquitous. The process
for the data acquisition is described in the chapter.
The thesis concludes with Chapter 7 summarising the major
contributions made in this research for computational stress research and
identifying questions emerging from this work for future research. Appendices
A-C provide material used in the research experiments that were conducted to
collect real-world data sets for observer stress for AVE, VE and RE.

Chapter 2 Background
This chapter* presents a literature survey and provides a background for the
work in this thesis. It discusses the definition of stress used in the literature,
sources of stress, human response signals to detect stress and computational
methods developed in the literature to objectively model stress. Subjective
assessment measures (e.g. survey reports), physiological measures (e.g. skin
conductivity, heart activity and brain activity) and physical measures (e.g.
behaviour, facial expressions and eye gaze) have been used to detect stress
which this chapter details and evaluates. These measures are referred to as
primary stress measures in this thesis. An evaluation of the objective measures is
given. This chapter also discusses stress monitoring systems available to
consumers, which are based on the primary stress measures. Further,
computational techniques that have been used to develop models of stress for
stress detection are discussed and evaluated.

2.1 Introduction
Traditional stress management and treatment techniques [25] that outline
general practices to implement have been utilised to facilitate coping and
dealing with stress to reduce the risk of negative effects on individuals, but
these practices are too general. Computer systems that dynamically provide
indications of stress have been exploited to determine stress in fighter pilots
[14], but were obtrusive and do not suit usual operations and behaviour.
However, less intrusive systems have been developed to detect stress in car
drivers [17].

Chapter 2: Background
Various response (or symptom) measures have been used to interpret
stress. The response measures reflect reactions of individuals and their body to
stressful situations. Some individuals may react differently to stressful events
from others due to their body conditions, age, gender, experience and so on.
There are techniques, such as artificial neural networks, that can deal with these
variables [26]. Additionally, uncertainties and complexities also exist that need
to be dealt with when defining stress. Techniques, such as fuzzy logic, can
narrow the gap.
Hormonal imbalances and physiological and physical changes are some
characteristics associated with stress i.e. they are symptoms of stress. When a
person is under stress, increased amounts of stress hormones (e.g. cortisol or
catecholamine levels) are released and measures for these hormones are
obtained via invasive methods (e.g. taking blood, saliva or urine samples),
possibly performed by qualified practitioners, and require lengthy analysis
procedures conducted by qualified scientists ([27-30]). Also under stress,
changes in heart rate (HR) [31], blood pressure (BP) [32], pupil dilation (PD)
[33], breathing pattern [34], galvanic skin response (GSR) [35], emotion [36],
voice intonation [37] and body pose [38] are observed, which, unlike measuring
stress hormones, can be acquired through non-invasive means. This thesis
concentrates on non-invasive and automated methods requiring shorter time
periods for detecting and analysing stress. Physiological (e.g. heart rate, skin
conductivity) and physical (e.g. facial expressions, voice intonation, body poses,
and gestures) features enable such methods and can be used to model stress
objectively.
The current focus of stress research is to determine ways to detect stress
and is in the early stages of computational modelling. A range of techniques
from various fields, including computer science (e.g. bio-inspired, machine
learning, data mining), engineering and statistics, have been applied to stress
problems. This chapter will investigate sensors for primary measures
(physiological and physical measures) of stress and computational techniques

10

2.2 Definition of Stress
used for signal analysis, feature extraction, stress detection and recognition, and
computational models used in the literature over the recent years.
In this chapter, a measure of stress refers to a primary (or symptom)
measure (or signal) for stress, monitoring stress means examining fluctuations in
primary measures for stress, and indication or detection of stress refers to certain
fluctuations in primary measures for stress that show an increase in stress
towards distress. These terms will be used in the chapter to describe work done
in the literature.

2.2 Definition of Stress
The term, stress, as applied to biology was coined by Hans Selye in the 1930s.
Selye defined stress as “the non-specific response of the body to any demand
for change”. In general, stress is a “complex reaction pattern that often has
psychological, cognitive and behavioural components” [1]. It can essentially be
used to describe the wear and tear of the body that experiences changing
environments, thus giving three main facets – input stimulus, evaluation and
response [2]. Stress has been studied in a range of fields with different
backgrounds and focus. It has been described differently in different fields with
diverse meanings, but the definition of stress is still elusive, even within a
single field, like psychology [39]. In medical terms, stress is defined as the
body’s psychological and physical (including behavioural) reaction or response
to the imbalance between demands and the resources available for a person. It
is known as a natural alarm, resistance and exhaustion [40] system for the body
to prepare for a fight or flight response to protect the body from threats and
make the body adjust to changes. The different phases of stress, response,
resistance and exhaustion, are defined in Selye’s famous definition of the
General Adaptation Syndrome [41].
When an individual is under a stressful situation, hormonal and nerve
signals are sent by the hypothalamus gland to the adrenal glands. Then

11

Chapter 2: Background
hormones including stress hormones, such as cortisol and adrenaline, are
released for the body to provoke action. Stress affects various areas of the body,
with physiological changes, such as heart rate, blood pressure, pupil dilation,
breathing patterns [34], and galvanic skin response. Glucose levels are rapidly
elevated in the bloodstream, and energy supplies are mobilised and directed to
critical regions of the body. Stress can be good, but it can also be dangerous
depending of the intensity, duration and frequency.
There are two forms of stress, which have been defined by Selye [42].
Good stress, eustress, results in a more favourable and positive state whereas
bad stress, distress, leads to an eventual negative biased (emotional, mental or
physical) state. Some indicators of eustress have been defined to be pleasurable
psychological states, positive emotions (e.g. joy, happiness, and excitement),
hope and meaningfulness [43-45]. In this thesis, stress will be referred to
negative stress in the dimension towards distress, tension, fear and anger.
Stress can provide benefits [46] in various ways, including taking forms
of motivation or encouragement to complete tasks. On the other hand, stress
has been known to decrease concentration and attention levels [47, 48], impair
capabilities in learning and decision making [49], and reduce performance [50].
Long-term or chronic stress can lead to illnesses affecting the brain [51], immune
[52], cardiovascular [53] and gastrointestinal systems [2], and has been found to
have links to diseases, such as, depression [54], cancer [55] and sleeping [34]
problems. In addition, stress has been reported to promote cancer growth and
reduce the effectiveness of cancer treatments in animal models [56]. Without
stress, individuals run the risk of boredom and with too much stress they are in
threat of damaging their well-being. Therefore, it is important to strike the right
balance of stress to maximise the benefits. This thesis aims to develop a
computational method to objectively understand stress.
Usually, people can subconsciously determine whether an environment
is stressful well. The challenge in this thesis is to develop objective methods for
assessing stress and develop a model computationally based on people’s

12

2.2 Definition of Stress
physiology, affect, cognition and behaviour. As a consequence, the model could
be used to interpret the stress of the environment based on objective reactions
of people, thus giving a stress model of an environment based on people’s
perceptions of the environment.
Short-term or acute stress is a common type of stress and has been a
common area of study. During the initial phase of stress, cortisol is secreted the
most [57]. In high doses or in cases of slow recovery [58], acute stress can be as
harmful as chronic stress. Through the study of hormone production
behaviour, an individual may form an adaptation mechanism for being
exposed to a stressor for an extended period [57], but the body shows more
distinctive signs of stress to novel stressors [59] or in the case of increased
perceived impact [60]. Health and psychological problems can be better
predicted by acute stress [25], thus there is vast amount of literature
surrounding these types of stress [61-66]. Moreover, acute stress can be
recognised by most people because the symptoms are new to the body.
Observers are good predictors of stress as well. A scenario is when a person
stands up in front of an audience to talk. Members of the audience can deduce
that the presenter is stressed by analysing physical characteristics, such as,
voice and gestures.
Some symptoms of stress, generally obvious to individuals, include
anxiety, anger, agitation, annoyance, fear, frustration, preoccupation [67],
tension and depression [68, 69]. Stress can be measured by measuring these
symptoms or emotions. Emotions have been defined by valence and arousal
dimensions. The valence and arousal dimensions are continuous scales ranging
from negative to positive. Valence depicts pleasantness, whereas the arousal
dimension shows excitement. Physiological and physical measures and human
reports can be used to determine valence and arousal thus emotions that show
stress.
Hormonal imbalances, physiological and physical changes are some
characteristics that show symptoms of stress thus giving an objective definition

13

Chapter 2: Background
for stress. Stress hormones can be obtained to measure stress but such measures
are obtained invasively. This thesis will concentrate on non-invasive methods
for obtaining stress characteristics, which can be acquired from physiological
and physical signals. Physiological features, such as, increase in heart rate and
higher skin conductivity, are related to stress. Some examples of physical
features that are affected by stress are changes facial expressions, voice
intonation and gestures. Changes in these physical features can mount to
change in behaviour and from which stress could be recognised as well. In this
thesis, physiological and physical characteristics are used to model stress levels
of an individual influenced by their environment.
There is a wide range of individuals considered in stress research. The
groups of people whose stress has been monitored using non-invasive
techniques include computer users [18], army officers [19, 20], car drivers [1517], pilots in flight [20, 21], surgeons conducting an operation [22], and surgical
patients [23]. Agitation in dementia patients have been automatically
recognised as well [70, 71]. Stress on drivers has been found to have the same
devastating effects on driving as talking on a mobile phone or having eyes off
the road [47]. The research in this thesis could potentially benefit these people.

2.3 Sources of Stress
Stress is caused by an unpleasant intervention in the form of real events or
perceived impact, namely a stressor. High cognitive load, extreme temperatures,
demanding physical activities, and predicting and waiting, or witnessing a
present or past horrific experience, are some forms of ways to increase stress
levels. Meditation [72], hypnosis [8], listening to relaxing music [73] and
reading [27] are known to reduce stress. In some cases, activities affect stress
levels more than others for instance, classical or self-selected relaxing music
reduces stress levels significantly compared to silence or listening to rock music
[35]. In terms of the symptoms of stress, meditation has been found to have a

14

2.3 Sources of Stress
greater impact on GSR than listening to music [74]. Drinking black tea [58]
reduces stress by reducing levels of cortisol. In a physiological sense, the
activities reduce cortisol levels, and increase HRV.
However the effects are quite the opposite when an individual is
exposed to stressors. Common stressors tend to contribute to cognitive load.
Stressors that have been used in stress experiments to stimulate stress or
emotions that induce stress include video (action) games [75, 76], solving
difficult mathematical/logical problems [77], energetic music (including rock
[75]), movies or film clips [75, 78], public speaking [79], and preparing and
delivering verbal responses to threats and accusations [58]. Other forms of
stressors include the Paced Stroop Test [80, 81] (a clinical mental stress test that
uses an interactive software application for individuals to identify font colours
of words within a given time period where the words spell out colours) and the
Cold Pressor Test [30, 82] (requires immersing a person’s body in icy cold
water).
There are mixed classifications for exercise as a stressor [27, 83-86].
Exercise has physiological characteristics of a stressor, but it improves mood,
fitness and health (provided that it is not excessive) [77], which is quite the
opposite to other stressors. However, exercise is generally considered to be a
stressor [87, 88].
Stressors can be characterised as physical, biological, cognitive,
emotional and psychosocial. In this thesis we do not make distinctions between
the different types of stressors and thus, stress.
Symptoms of stress tend to appear a brief period of time after a stressor is
observed [17]. The expected physiological effect of a stressor takes may take up
to several seconds or minutes to recover. The recovery time is dependent on the
type of stressor and physiology of individuals. Research suggests that
physically active individuals respond to stress with lower variations in stress
hormones and lower physiological responses compared to individuals who do

15

Chapter 2: Background
not exercise regularly [79]. As a result, exercise makes an individual more
resistant to stress.

2.4 Measuring Stress
Traditionally, stress has been measured using assessment based on humans
rating stress levels on some scale (e.g. Relative Stress Scale [89], Fear Survey
Schedule [90], Cook-Medley Hostility Scale [91], and Brief Symptom Inventory
[67, 92]), which are subjective. All these assessments require major human
intervention, including manually recognising and interpreting visual patterns
(possibly with some support tools) of behaviour in observational studies. Stress
experiments that use various sensors to obtain objective measures of stress also
use subjective assessment to verify measurements obtained from sensors [17].
Lack of data and insufficient capability of existing modelling techniques force
the activity of measuring stress to include these subjective conventional
methods. It is regarded that self-assessment is a good measure of stress [89, 91],
and this motivates this research that more work needs to be done to bring
objective methods for measuring stress up to par (if not, even better).
Techniques that measure stress hormones, e.g. salivary cortisol levels
[27-29], urinary catecholamine levels [30], and blood glucose levels can be used
to determine stress levels but require invasive methods. In addition, an increase
in cortisol levels is “positively correlated with negative perceptions” [77].
However, in some stressful situations cortisol levels are significantly low, which
can result from other processes in the human body e.g. enhanced short-term
memory [93]. As a consequence, cortisol measurements cannot be solely used to
determine stress.
The primary measures for stress investigated in this thesis are
physiological and physical measures. A physical feature or characteristic is
defined as a property in which humans can see changes without the need for
equipment and tools, unlike physiological features, which require the use of

16

2.4 Measuring Stress
tools that need to be attached to individuals to detect general fluctuations.
However, sophisticated equipment and sensors using vision and audio
technologies are still needed to obtain physical signals at sampling rates
sufficient for data analysis and modelling.
Common techniques for detecting stress include analysing physiological
signals, electroencephalography (EEG), blood volume pulse (BVP), heart rate
variability (HRV), galvanic skin response (GSR), and electromyography (EMG).
In addition, physical signals for measuring stress include eye gaze, pupil
dilation, voice characteristic, and face movement. Figure 2.1 shows the physical
and physiological signals that will be investigated and in this research.
Some high level properties for primary measures that indicate stress are:
1. Increase in galvanic skin response over a period of time
(1)

2. Increase in heart rate variability over a period of time (which is the rate
of change of heart beat)
(2)

3. Increase in pupil dilation over a period of time
(3)

4. Decrease in skin temperature over a period of time
(4)

5. Decrease in blood volume pulse over a period of time

2.5 Subjective Assessment Stress Measures

2.5 Subjective Assessment Stress Measures
A common approach for stress measurement is subjective self assessment
because it is widely accepted that individuals are generally good assessors of
their personal stress levels. It is the result of the fact that individuals are
different and have different experiences, personalities and have developed
somewhat different stress resistance and coping mechanisms. Logically, this
would suggest that individuals can assess and manage their stress solely, but it
is not always true. There is evidence showing that underlying assessment,
resistance and coping mechanisms may not be that different after all. Stress
management and treatment techniques have been developed and there are
organisations established with the goal to help individuals coping with stress.
Research has moved in the direction to measure stress objectively and results of
initial research suggests that it has the potential to be used solely without the
need for human intervention in stress assessment [95].
Subjective based measures for stress have been used widely [96].
Assessments based self-reports and observational studies, induced by tasks e.g.
driving tasks [17], interview and/or questionnaires [97-99], are a common type
of measure for stress [17, 35], especially in the field of Psychology. There is a
range of stress (or stress-related) assessment scales, including the Relative
Stress Scale [89], Fear Survey Schedule [90], Cook-Medley Hostility Scale [91],
and Brief Symptom Inventory [67, 92]. All these assessments require major
human intervention, including manually recognising and interpreting visual
patterns (possibly with some support tools) of behaviour in observational
studies. Solely, stress inventories measure baseline stress, but our focus is to
measure instantaneous stress that accounts for baseline stress and stress caused
by the environments observed by individuals. Then this can be used to
determine stress patterns across multiple individuals.
Stress experiments that use various sensors to obtain objective measures
of stress also use questionnaires to verify measurements obtained from sensors

19

Chapter 2: Background
[17], which is due to the lack of data and techniques developed for stress
research from which models and classification techniques can be compared. It is
regarded that self assessment is a good measure of stress [89, 91], which could
be due to the lack of objective measures. Another reason for such a claim is the
vagueness in the definition of stress.
Subjective measures may not be reliable methods for measuring stress
especially when used in isolation because of the encouragement of cognitive
mediation [76]. The context in which a particular type of subjective assessment
is done could influence the assessment as reported in a study done to assess
media quality [100]. In addition, these measures have been used to measure
stress in simple or familiar environments e.g. listening to music of different
genres [35]. The method of subjective assessment also raises problems for
measuring stress in complex and changing environments e.g. individuals find it
challenging to determine stress levels in unfamiliar environments [95]. Recent
research in stress has been investigating objective measures for stress. In a
research project that investigated the effectiveness of music in dealing with
stress, physiological measures along with self-assessment reports were used to
determine stress [35]. Physiological signals have been shown to be highly
correlated with subjective assessment [76]. Our research aims to develop an
objective metric for stress.
Provided that the raw rating, mean and standard deviation are ,

and

respectively, numerical ratings in stress questionnaires have been normalised
using equation (6) and then back transformation used to obtain the average and
standard deviation statistics to determine statistical significance.

(6)

Methods and tools required for subjective assessment as stress measures
are less expensive compared to those that require high-sophisticated sensors,
computational power and memory and similar technologies. The problems
20

2.6 Physiological Stress Measures
with self assessment include under or over-estimating stress levels. In order to
minimise these deviations, questions and the structure of assessment in self
assessments must be carefully designed [101, 102].

2.6 Physiological Stress Measures
The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS), responsible for involuntary activities,
is made up of Sympathetic and Parasympathetic nervous systems. Stressful
events or emergency situations cause dynamic changes in ANS, where the
activity rate in the Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) increases and the
Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS) activity decreases. Alternatively,
activities in the PNS dominate during resting activities. SNS and PNS regulate
the galvanic skin response, heart rate variability, and brain waves, which are
the main measures for stress used in the literature, and other physiological
systems including blood pressure. Details of how stress affects the ANS at
molecular and cellular levels are provided in [103]. Note that stress towards
distress is not a sole contributor to changes in the ANS and the features it
controls, for instance, eustress (which characterises as a positive state e.g. joy)
can elevate skin conductance like distress [104].
Symptoms of stress appear as time progresses and this makes continuous
recordings of physiological signals significant to monitor variations and trends
to detect stress reliably. In order to deal with voluminous data associated with
such recordings, measurements from physiological sensors are usually divided
into segments before features are obtained. In a driving experiment [17],
segments were made up of 5 minute data out of 30 minutes, which included
rest, city and highway driving representing low, medium and high stress
respectively. Main statistical features obtained from physiological data have
included normalised mean, root mean square, mean amplitude, variance, and
normalised signals. Using feature values over time segments does not only
provide data from different perspectives but also helps reduce the effect of

21

Chapter 2: Background
noisy or missing data during analysis as opposed to analysing raw signal
values.

2.6.1 Skin Conductivity
Galvanic skin response (GSR), also known as skin conductance or electrodermal
activity response, is reliable indicator of stress [17, 35, 105, 106]. It is a
measurement of flow of electricity through the skin of an individual. When the
individual is under stress, skin conductance is increased [107] due to increase in
moisture on the surface of the skin, which increases the flow of electricity.
Conversely, the skin conductance is reduced when the individual becomes less
stressed. Physiological details of the way the SNS affects skin conductance can
be found in [108].
The fluctuations in skin conductance are recorded as changes in GSR.
Variations in GSR have reflected stress levels in individuals while they played a
competitive racing game [73]. In addition, cognitive load [109] and work
performance [76], which can be seen as stressors [110, 111], have strong
correlations with GSR.
GSR measurement can be taken by measuring electrical potentials
between electrodes placed on surfaces of the skin. Electrodes are typically
placed on the hand, first and middle fingers. Some popular equipment used in
stress related research experiments to monitor GSR include the Biopac
GSR100C [73], Thought Technology Limited GSR2 [81], Affectiva Q Sensor
[112], BodyMedia Sensewear [78], and BodyBugg [113]. A couple of these
systems are shown in Figure 2.2. An analysis of the characteristics of the
equipment systems is given in Table 2.1.

2.6 Physiological Stress Measures
GSR features that require minimal calculations (e.g. mean and sum) have
been used to compare stress in different tasks [109]. More complex features
such as, the number of orienting responses in a time segment, sum of the startle
magnitudes, sum of the response durations, and sum of the estimated areas
under the responses have also been used [114]. However, it is not known
whether these complex measures gave better indications of stress than minimal
calculations.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a popular non-invasive measure to detect
cardiovascular conditions [115], ANS activities [26], and is another reliable
primary measure for stress [31, 106, 115-117]. Many stress monitoring systems
use HRV to detect stress [118, 119]. It is believed that HRV also reflects how
well individuals are able to adapt to changes [115].
Electrocardiogram (ECG), also known as elektrokardiogramm (EKG), is
highly sensitive to heartbeats and a superior measurement to derive HRV
signals [120]. ECG is a graphical recording of electrical activity produced by an
impulse of ions flowing through cardiac muscles, which dissipates into the
region around the heart with diminished amounts spreading around the
surface of the body. The main electrical signals are produced by cardiac cells
depolarising and repolarising. Depolarising occurs due to the flow of ions
accompanying atrial heart muscle constriction which results in a P wave. The
impulse then travels through the ventricles of the heart causing septal
depolarisation, early ventricular depolarisation followed by late ventricular
depolarisation. This series forms a QRS wave, the dominant wave. After the
completion of depolarisation, ventricular cells repolarise by restoring it to
resting polarity, resulting in a T wave. The main waves in an ECG are shown in
Figure 2.1 and their descriptions are summarised in Table 2.2.

27

Chapter 2: Background
A change in potential can be measured between electrodes attached to a
person’s body on each side of the heart during the electrical stimulation cycle of
the heart. ECG signals are periodic and have persistent features such as R-R
intervals, a parameter to determine HRV. The Einthoven’s Triangle, theoretical
triangle area around the heart representing lead vectors, can be used for lead
configuration based on desired information. There are three main lead
configurations, but Lead I is sufficient to obtain a HRV signal because it gives
the complete QRS waveform [121].
Popular systems used to obtain continuous heart rate include the
Thought Technology FlexComp and Biopac ECG100C (shown in Figure 2.4)
[73]. An analysis of these systems is presented in Table 2.3.
Acute stress causes the heart to contract with high force and increased
frequency. With more chronic stress, the mass of the heart is increased to
provide the body with greater response to stressors [122]. A decrease in ECG
amplitude is an indicator of stress in healthy individuals [123]. This is due to
vasoconstriction, where peripheral blood vessels constrict. Details of how the
SNS affects heart activity when an individual is exposed to stressors are
presented in [124].
Heart activity has been found to be more correlated with stress as
opposed to EMG and respiration recordings [17]. However, the baseline heart
rate depends on cardiovascular fitness of an individual and the activity the
individual is doing at the time. This means that heart activity measurements
cannot be directly compared across multiple people for stress unless
measurements are standardised using some baseline measurements.

HRV is an indicator of dynamic and cumulative load, making it a good
measure for stress. Short term lower HRV reflects acute stress, which means
that HRV can be negatively affected during stress [125]. Generally, low
frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) bands of HRV are used to analyse
stress. LF and HF are known to reflect SNS and PNS activities respectively. LF

31

Chapter 2: Background
has been categorised as 0-0.08 Hz [17], 0.04-0.15 Hz [26, 126] or 0.05-0.15 Hz [31,
81] and HF has is either in the 0.15–0.5 Hz [17, 31] or 0.16-0.40 Hz [81] range. It
has been suggested that these definitions for frequency bands could be
inappropriate if the respiratory frequencies are not in the range of 0.15-0.40 Hz
because it could affect ANS activity estimates [126]. Examples of activities
where the respiratory frequencies could be extreme are during intense exercise
or during extreme relaxation with respiratory frequencies of 0.7 Hz and 0.1 Hz
respectively [126]. The frequency of ECG between 0 Hz and 0.04 Hz, sometimes
known as very low frequency (VLF), has been found to distort stress detection
[127].
Stress levels are expected to increase with increase in Energy RatioECG in
Equation (7) (used as a stress feature in [17, 81, 128]), which is defined in terms
of total energy values in LF and HF:

(7)

A clustering based fuzzy model has been established where HRV features are
mapped to a 0-100 (mental) stress scale [26]. Three HRV features, each corresponding
to VLF (0.01-0.04 Hz), LF (0.04-0.15 Hz) and HF (0.15-0.5 Hz) bands, were used as
parameters to the fuzzy model. The features were defined using continuous wavelet
transformations, where detailed definitions are given in [26].

2.6.3 Brain Activity
Research shows that relationships exist between brain activity and stress [129,
130] and further research is required for more insight to develops models based
on brain activity to determine stress. Some methods by which data can be
obtained for analysing brain activity are functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and electroencephalography
(EEG). EEG is currently the most commonly used of the above stress measures.
32

2.6 Physiological Stress Measures
This is due to its high temporal resolution, low intrusive equipment and low
cost. EEG has been used to determine stress levels in computer game players
[129] and biofeedback games [130].
Neural activity in the brain produces electrical signals, including well
known signals that are captured in EEG. EEG records complex electrical
waveforms at the scalp formed by action electrical potentials during synaptic
excitations and inhibitions of dendrites. Potentials at the scalp range from 20 to
100 V [131], which can be recorded by pairs of electrodes attached to the scalp
on opposite sides of the brain hemisphere. The diagram in Figure 2.6 shows the
placement locations for EEG electrodes according to the International 10-10
system standard. In this configuration, distances between adjacent electrodes
are 10% of the total front-back or right-left of the skull. The International 10-20
system standard is a variation of the International 10-10 system standard in that
it does not require as many electrodes. The International 10-20 system standard
has distances between adjacent electrodes that are 10% or 20% of the total frontback or right-left of the skull.
EEG electrodes are identified by their names, which include information
on their placement location on the head. The name of an electrode consists of a
letter and a number, which correspond to the brain lobe and the location on the
hemisphere respectively. The brain lobes are shown in Figure 2.5. Letters and
numbers in the electrode names and their respective lobes and positions on the
brain hemisphere are presented in Table 2.4.
The EEG waveforms are characterised by frequency, amplitude, shape
and sites of the scalp. Also, age and state of alertness is also relevant to analyse
the waveforms [131]. Activities in the right hemisphere of the brain dominate
the activities in the left hemisphere of the brain during negative emotions [132],
which suggests an area for stress detection. Details of the way stress affects the
brain are provided in [133].

correspond to the electrodes of the Emotiv EPOC headset which follows the
International 10-20 system standard. The figure is adapted from [134].

Examples of systems used to source EEG are BioSemi and FlexComp
systems. These equipments require a relatively higher degree of intrusion
because the subject has to wear a head cap with electrical conductivity gel and
electrodes that need to be attached to particular positions of the subject’s head.
The level of intrusion can stir potential subjects away from research
experiments that use such equipment. In addition, preparing the equipment
and the subjects for EEG data acquisition can take a relatively long time.
Alternatively, EEG can be sourced using less intrusive equipments, such as the
Emotiv EPOC headset. The highlighted electrode positions in Figure 2.6

correspond to the electrodes for the Emotive EPOC headset. Examples of
equipments used to source EEG are presented in Figure 2.7 and an analysis of

EEG signals are categorised by frequency and each category represents
some state for a person. The indices, waves or bands in the EEG are categorised
in Table 2.6. Beta and alpha waves represent conscious states whereas theta and
delta waves signify unconscious states [135]. Rapid beta wave frequencies
(resulting from a decrease in alpha wave frequencies) is the main characteristic
indicating stress [75, 131, 135]. Alpha waves appear on both sides of the brain,
but slightly higher in amplitude on the non-dominant side, generally observed
in people who are right-handed [131]. Band pass filtering can be used to
remove noise and obtain certain parts and features of an EEG signal before
analysis. EEG signals can be filtered using a band pass filter with appropriate
values for low and high pass filters e.g. 30 Hz and 4 Hz respectively.

Brain activity has been examined for those who have experienced
chronic stress. It has been found that females with post-traumatic stress have an
increased activation in the anterior and middle insula when presented with
stimuli that reminded them of the previous stressful events [136]. This
characteristic was obtained through fMRI recordings and analysis. In a different
study, positive, neutral and negative emotions were classified using EEG [132].
EEG frequency band power, cross-correlation between band powers, peak
frequency in alpha band and Hjorth parameters [137] were some features used.
Hjorth parameters are time-based characteristics of an EEG signal and details
can be found in [137].
Signal processing methods (e.g. FT) have been applied to EEG and
analysed in time, frequency and spatial domains. For physical stress [138], Ratio
of Power Spectral Densities of the Alpha and Beta bands has been calculated
and analysed for stress [139]. Results suggested that the ratios for Alpha ( )
and Beta ( ) powers defined as given in equations (8) and (9) respectively were
negatively correlated with self-reports.

hemispheres of the brain. Beta bands, , are similarly represented.
Measurements for Hjorth parameters [137] and fractal dimensions [140]
are other measures used in analyzing EEG signals. Hjorth parameters are timebased characteristics of an EEG signal and the three Hjorth parameters are the
Activity, Mobility and Complexity parameters. Suppose x is an EEG signal with
values for N equally spaced timestamps. Then the Activity parameter is the
variance for an EEG signal and is defined by

(10)

The Mobility parameter is a measure of the signal mean frequency. Given that
x’ is the derivate for x, then the Mobility parameter is defined by

management by training the brain to reduce symptoms of stress e.g. Interactive
Productline Mindball, a competitive game system. Mindball uses EEG
information to assess stress and provide feedback over a period of time, and the
player with lower stress levels win the game [75].
EEG signals may have more information about stress levels than blood
pressure and heart rate. EEG has been claimed to show differences in relaxation
(opposite of stress) levels that blood pressure and heart rate information cannot
illustrate [75]. Sum of alpha and theta, and the sum of alpha, beta and theta are
good measures [75] for relaxation. It is not yet known whether EEG gives more
details of stress than GSR.
Stress states have been classified using EEG data and a decision tree
model [129]. Other work has used EEG to classify states that are not directly
related to stress but could be used as a basis for further EEG-based stress

41

Chapter 2: Background
models. SVMs, ANNs and Bayesian classifiers have not showed much variation
in performance for classifying emotions ranging from positive to negative
emotions [132]. In addition, EEG data has been used to classify different tasks
with ANNs and SVMs and their variance in performance was not significant
[141].

2.6.4 Other Primary Physiological Measures
The primary measures of stress presented in this section are not reliable if used
solely. They are usually used in conjunction with other primary measures
discussed above. Apart from stress, there are other body triggers that affect
signals of the primary measures investigated in this section by distorting the
signals, so it makes stress detection difficult if used as a single measure to
detect stress.

Blood Pressure
Blood pressure (BP) is the pressure exerted on the walls of blood vessels due to
blood circulation and varies between a systolic (maximum) and a diastolic
(minimum) pressure. An increase BP has been related with increase in stress
[142].
Continuous BP waveforms can be measured using systems like the
Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor (ABPM-50) or Finapres (FINger Arterial
PRESsure) monitor system shown in Figure 2.8. Just like traditional BP
monitoring systems, ABPM-50 requires a cuff to be wrapped around the upper
arm. However, Finapres requires its cuff to be wrapped around a finger and is
less intrusive and less disruptive.

Blood Volume Pulse
Blood volume is the amount of blood in a blood tissue during a certain time
interval. Blood flow through the blood vessels after each heart beat causes
changes in light reflections, thus, provides measures for constriction of blood
vessels and heart rate. Decreases in blood volume pulse (BVP) have shown to
43

Chapter 2: Background
be correlated with increases in stress and lower stress levels have illustrated
increases in BVP [143]. Measurements of BVP can be taken using a
Photoplethysmography (PPG) from the skin capillary bed of a finger. A PPG
bounces infra-red light on the skin and the amount of light reflected provides a
measurement of the amount of blood present in the region. It has been used by
commercial (HRV-based) stress monitoring systems [144, 145]. BVP has been
used with other physiological measures to detect stress more reliably [81].

Muscle Activity
Electromyography (EMG) shows electrical activity produced by active muscles
i.e. muscle action potentials. For stress detection, EMG electrodes have been
placed on the trapezius muscle [17], which is located in the shoulder. Other
measurements, such as, GSR and ECG, have been found to be better indicators
of stress [17].

Skin Temperature
Skin temperature (ST) has been used to measure stress in conjunction with
other primary measures [18]. Investigations show that ST is negatively
correlated with stress i.e. ST increases when stress levels decrease and ST
decreases when stress increases [143]. ST has been measured using LM34 IC by
placing the sensor on the distal phalanx of the left thumb [81].

Respiration
The rate and volume of respiration has been used to measure levels of stress but
generally in conjunction with other physiological measures [35]. Most
respiration monitoring systems require individuals to wear a belt around their
chest [17]. This type of a system is intrusive and may restrict individuals from
performing their regular activities. In addition, it has been claimed that other
44

2.7 Physical Measures
physiological measures, such as HRV and GSR, reflect stress levels to a greater
extent than respiration, particularly in driver stress [17].

2.7 Physical Measures
In this thesis, a physical feature or characteristic is defined as a property that
humans can see changes in without the need for equipment and tools, unlike
physiological features, which require the use of tools to detect general
fluctuations. Physical signals that are sensitive to stress are behaviour, gesture,
body movement, facial expression, eye gaze, blinks, pupil dilation, and voice.

2.7.1 Behaviour, Gesture and Interaction
Body language can express stress states and humans are generally good
assessors at finding these relationships. Body language is defined by body pose
and/or body motion. Recognition of body language requires complex
techniques that consider degrees of freedom for body configurations and vast
variations in motion. Behaviour can be determined by examining body
language. Behavioural recognition and analysis requires computer vision
techniques with the purpose of understanding a visual environment. However,
the common method for determining stress through behaviour is by human
experts. Stress levels in car drivers have been assessed by humans who used
their judgement to examine driver behaviour on recorded videos [17]. Future
research could include developing techniques for automated stress detection
from behaviour data. Due to the time-varying nature of stress, HMM, Markov
chains, Bayesian classifiers [146], Hidden Semi-Markov Models, ANN,
Temporal Scenario Recognition and Petri Nets are some types of techniques
that can be investigated for interpreting and analysing behaviour associated
with stress.

45

Chapter 2: Background
Stress models based on gesture and interaction features have been quite
simplistic. Driving scenarios are rich in stress stimuli that induce drivers to
react by gestures, which is an area where stress has been modelled. Gesture
recognition has been used to determine stress in car drivers [17]. Approaches
for predicting driver behaviour have also been developed through vision based
techniques and dynamic Markov models [147, 148]. Haptic cues have been used
in

stress

Investigations with mouse movement show that individuals click mouse
buttons harder as their stress decreases [107].

2.7.2 Facial Features
Facial features can provide insight to feelings and mental states for individuals
including stress. When conversing with an individual, a person can get
feedback from facial features which they can act accordingly e.g. the person
might cut a long story short when they observe and realise that the individual
is showing signs of frustration, agitation or preoccupation by less nodding,
reduced facial muscle movements or frequent eye movements to other objects
in the surroundings.
There are systems (e.g. FaceLAB, NEVEN Vision [149]) that automatically
determine facial features (e.g. points on face, head movements, levels of mouth
openness) from cameras or videos. FaceLAB, a product by Seeing Machines, is a
system for head and face tracking and allows obtaining measurements at a
sampling rate of 60 Hz for facial features including eye gaze, pupil dilation and
blinking signals non-invasively and non-intrusively. The equipment consists of
a pair of cameras, with infrared lighting. It does not require any form of contact
during signal acquisition. The FaceLAB system is shown in Figure 2.9.

46

2.7 Physical Measures

Figure 2.9: The FaceLAB system for face, eye and pupil tracking

Facial Expressions
Stress classification models have been developed from facial feature data and
results show that facial expressions can be used to show stress [150]. When
responding to stressors, facial expressions indicate biological responses reliably
[28], which are commonly used to assess stress. Online analysis of facial
expressions can be used to predict behaviour and events, e.g. car accidents, in
real-time [151]. Facial muscle movements have been used to determine stress.
Increase in head and mouth movements indicate increase in stress [107].
Human observers are good at assessing individuals’ stress. The human
brain of a healthy individual has facial expression recognition detectors to
determine emotions that show symptoms of stress of a person but
unfortunately the process by which the brain deduces such conclusions is yet to
be understood. Machine learning techniques [152], including SVM, principal
component analysis [153], and decision tree-based classifiers [153] have been
used for facial expression recognition.

47

Chapter 2: Background
Eye Gaze
Eyes can provide information in social interaction. Eye gaze provides
information on an individual’s attention source, and enables deducing the
individual’s mental states and intentions. Using eyes to focus on a particular
object on a computer screen for a greater period of time and frequent focuses on
the object are characteristics that correlate with stress levels [107]. The types of
measures obtained from eye gaze for measuring stress include gaze spatial
distribution and percentage of saccadic eye movement [107].

Pupil Dilation
Pupil dilation has been examined for stress detection [80]. If an individual’s
pupil dilation increases [154, 155], the pupil dilates at a higher frequency, then
it suggests that the individual is possibly in a stressed state [107]. However,
both negative and positive stimuli can cause an increase in pupil dilation.
Results of a research experiment suggested that pupil dilation increased
significantly when experiment participants were exposed to negative and
positive arousing sounds [33].
A common characteristic used in stress detection is the mean value for
pupil dilation over time. An increase in stress has been shown by increasing
mean values over a time period [81]. Interpolation techniques have been used
to determine pupil dilation during blinks [81], but simple techniques such as
replacing the blink with the last valid pupil dilation measurement value
suffices [33].
Some eye tracking systems used to determine pupil dilation are the
FaceLAB 4.5 [156] and ASL-504 eye gaze tracking system [81] with sampling
rates of 60 Hz, and Applied Science Laboratories series 4000 eye tracking
system with a sampling rate of 50 Hz [33]. The eye monitored for pupil dilation
does not seem to be significant but individuals’ left eyes are commonly used to
monitor pupil dilation [33, 80].
48

2.7 Physical Measures
Eye Blink
Eye blinks are sensitive to stress but conflicting characteristics have been
suggested for stress detection. Some literatures state that higher frequency of
blinks are detected when an individual is under stressful conditions [157]
whereas others seem to suggest the opposite [107]. These conflicting
conclusions could have been caused by analysing data obtained from different
experiment environments. The results of the literature that suggested a
correlation between higher frequency of blinks and stress were acquired from
real driving experiments whereas the results analysed from solving
mathematical tasks on a computer suggested the opposite. In addition, faster
eye closure has been suggested as a characteristic for higher stress levels [107].

2.7.3 Voice
Stress in voice is defined as “observable variability in certain speech features
due to a response to stressors” [39]. Presently, ‘certain’ is not well defined and
the ‘features’ may include lexical, phonological or prosodic features. Detecting
stress in voice is a dynamic process. It is the nonverbal components of voice
that reflect stress. Key features claimed to show increases in stress are increases
in range and rapid fluctuations in fundamental frequency [158-160], increases in
energy for high frequency voice components [161], and greater proportions of
high frequency components [37].
Determining stress levels through speech is non-invasive, less obtrusive
and less expensive [19] compared to other methods for measuring stress. Such
stress monitoring systems are common and have been developed for users
including army officers [19], and video game players [95]. Air Force Research
Lab (USA) claims that a voice based stress detection system can efficiently
measure officers’ stress, with the aim to reduce their workload, improve their
effectiveness and, as a result, save lives [19]. Stress is part of everyday life and
can change the characteristics of speech. Intelligent speech recognition and
49

Chapter 2: Background
speaker identification systems use stress models to consider changes in speech
characteristics due to stress [162].
Speeches of drivers under stress have been modelled using signal
processing techniques, Teager energy operator (TEO) and multiresolution
analysis. Dynamic Bayesian networks and hidden Markov models were used to
classify the features within utterances. A SVM and an ANN were used to model
the features across utterances. [163]
Voice features for stress models include loudness, fundamental
frequency, zero-crossing rate, jitter and energy frequency ratios [37]. Stress
related emotions have been measured in speech by extracting features
including voice quality, pitch, duration, intensity, formants, vocal tract crosssection areas, frequency, Teager energy features, glottal characteristics, duration
of silence, and speech rate [160, 164-166]. A system that detects frustration and
annoyance (symptoms of stress) in voice has been developed for flight
telephone booking through a prosodic model [165]. Frustration was detected by
longer speech durations, slower speech and pitch rates.
Acoustic components in voice that can be used to show stress are caused
by physiological changes that depict signs that the human body is responding
to stress [37]. This is an example where physiological and physical
characteristics of stress are related. Micro-muscle tremors (MMT), caused by
muscle tension, and voice stress analysis (VSA) reflect stress. MMT is caused by
the muscles in the vocal tract and is transmitted through speech. MMT and
VSA have been used in lie detector systems [167].

2.8 Fusion of Measures
Combinations of sensors have been used to give a better measure of stress.
Facial expressions, eye movements, head movements, GSR, RTD and BVP data
have been fused to develop a stress model [107]. Physiological sensor data have
also been fused to determine stress. GSR, BVP and HR have been used to

50

2.9 Evaluation of Primary Stress Measures
determine stress in video game players [76]. Computer users have had their
GSR, EMG, ECG and respiration data used for stress classification [80]. Car
drivers have had their relative stress levels monitored by ECG, GSR, EMG and
respiration recordings, but ECG and GSR mirrored stress more reliably [17]. In
addition, drivers have had facial expressions and road conditions recorded and
synchronised to the physiological measures to support results [17]. Computer
users have had their HRV, GSR, pupil dilation and skin temperature recordings
monitored to detect stress [81].
Other work has involved using physiological measures to model
symptoms of stress e.g. agitation, anger, fear and frustration. HR, GSR and skin
temperature have been used to recognised agitation in dementia patients [70].
Emotions of anger, fear and frustration have been classified using GSR, HR and
skin temperature [78]. An emotional recognition system has been developed
based on EEG, GSR, HRV, BVP and respiration [168].
Some measures in a combination of measures may be redundant with
other measures and this may cause collection of unnecessarily large volumes of
data and unnecessary processing time. This motivates using an optimal
combination of measures for measuring stress. Techniques used that can be
used to determine an optimal measure combination include mutual information
measure [107] and principal component analysis [129].

2.9 Evaluation of Primary Stress Measures
Table 2.7 provides an empirical ranking of primary measures for stress based
on discussion in this chapter, their correlation with stress claimed in the
literature, equipment intrusiveness, techniques developed for mapping to stress
scales, and extent of usage in the literature. The ranking has been established in
[24].

microphones. However, physiological measures have been widely used for
stress detection even in stress monitoring systems, which require individuals to
wear or touch electrodes or sensors. Potential area of research could be to
develop stress detection techniques using physical measure features sufficiently
powerful so that individuals are not required to make contact with equipment.

2.10 Published Stress Data Sets
A data set for automobile drivers in different stress driving conditions,
consisting of physiological measures (ECG, EMG, GSR and respiration), have
52

2.11 Stress Monitoring Systems
been published and details are in [17]. The data set is available at
http://www.physionet.org/pn3/drivedb/

2.11 Stress Monitoring Systems
Commercial biofeedback systems (e.g. ThoughtStream [169], StressEraser [118],
emWave [119]) that provide continuous feedback have been developed to assist
with managing stress. Some stress monitoring systems are shown in Figure
2.10. The ThoughtStream system bases stress monitoring on GSR, while
StressEraser and emWave use HRV. Both, StressEraser and emWave use a PPG
sensor to monitor consecutive blood pulses in a finger and directs the user to
breathe in certain patterns to reduce stress [144, 145]. To lower stress levels
using the ThoughtStream system, the user listens to music where its tone is
controlled by the user’s GSR readings. There are similar systems, e.g. Procyon
[170] and Proteus, developed by Mindplace [171], the same manufacturers as
the ThoughtStream system, which extend the ThoughtStream system to
incorporate visualisation tools with visual material synchronised with music.

2.12 Computational Techniques for Modelling Stress
Various

software

programs,

tools

and

packages

(e.g.

Matlab

[172],

AcqKnowledge [173] and Biosignal Analysis Software [116]) are available for
analysing physiological and physical signals. Most of the tools and applications
are not specifically designed for primary measures of stress but they suffice for
general data exploration. Exploring signal data is beneficial because it enables
selection of appropriate computational techniques to model stress. It also
allows detection of noisy, corrupted or missing signal data, which is useful in
the process of preparing data before computational stress models are
developed. This section focuses on computational modelling techniques used
for stress.

2.12.1 Data Preparation
In order to remove individual differences and provide a more robust base for
comparisons, measurements for features can be standardised before analysis or
provided as model input. Let X represent a data point for some measure then X
can be standardised using equation (16).

(16)

Usually, standardised running average signals for primary measures
over time have been portrayed in graphs to illustrate the responses affected by
stress. Correlation analysis has been performed to determine relationships
between the primary signals and symptoms of stress at each of the time steps
[107].
Primary stress signals may have signal corruption when obtained from
sensors. These corruptions will generally be due to noise and other corruption
sources such as, transmission distortion. Techniques based on correlation
54

2.12 Computational Techniques for Modelling Stress
methods and evolutionary algorithms could be used to optimally remove signal
corruptions for modelling stress.

2.12.2 Feature Extraction Techniques
Various signal processing techniques have been used to extract features from
primary nonstationary signals of stress. Popular techniques include Fourier
transformations (FT) and wavelet transformations (WT). They can be used to
remove noise in time series or feature extraction [157, 174]. It is common to
transform physiological signals (e.g. EEG [157], GSR [17] and HRV [120]) from
time to frequency domain in order to extract features that are more apparent in
the frequency domain for analysis using FTs. WT is another technique that
allows signals to be transformed from time to frequency domains, but allows
data to be divided into different frequency components. Unlike FT, WT
performs well when approximating data that has sharp spikes and
discontinuities.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) have mainly been used to extract features from EEG data and
can be used for reducing the feature set or removing unwanted features from
the set of primary measures for stress models. PCA was used to reduce features
in EEG signals to model stress [129]. ICA has been used to remove eye
movement and other muscular movement information, which is generally
considered to be noise, from EEG signals [141].

2.12.3 Feature Selection Techniques
Large numbers, in the order of thousands, of stress features can be derived
from primary stress signals to analyse stress. This set of features may include
redundant and irrelevant features which may outweigh the more effective
features showing stress patterns. For sensor data, some features may suffer

55

Chapter 2: Background
from corruption as well if minimal feature extraction processing is done. This
could cause a model to capture patterns in the data that are not central to stress
and cause the model to produce lower quality classifications. The number of
features could also affect the classification performance for instance, if a large
number of features were to be provided as input to an ANN then it would
result in quite a large network. This can lead to the issue where the ratio for
number of samples to the number of connections and weights in an ANN could
be relatively small and result in poor classification performance. Selecting
effective features by reducing redundant and irrelevant features have been
known to improve the quality of pattern recognition [175] because it can help
the model better capture necessary patterns in the data and in turn, this can
improve the quality for recognition.
In order to achieve a good model, it should be robust to input tuples and
features that are redundant, irrelevant or suffer from corruption. A genetic
algorithm (GA) could help solve these problems by selecting salient subsets of
features for optimising stress recognition. GAs have been successfully used to
select features from large numbers of features (e.g. features from microarray
data [176]) and features derived from physiological signals [177, 178]. A GA is
based on the concept of natural evolution and has been commonly used to solve
optimization problems [179]. It evolves a population of candidate solutions,
represented by chromosomes, in search for better quality chromosomes. The
quality for each chromosome in the population is defined by some fitness
function. A GA search evolves a population of chromosomes using crossover,
mutation and selection operations. Crossover and mutation operations are
applied to chromosomes to achieve diversity in the population and reduce the
risk of the search being stuck with a local optimal population. After each
generation during the search, the GA selects chromosomes, mostly made up of
better quality chromosomes, for the population in the next generation to direct
the search to more favourable chromosomes.

56

2.12 Computational Techniques for Modelling Stress
Correlation analysis is another method that has been used to select
features appropriate for modelling. It has been mainly used to deal with
redundant features and reduce their effect on models. Correlation analysis
using correlation coefficients has been reported to detect some redundancies in
time-varying data [180].

2.12.4 Artificial Neural Networks
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are inspired by biological neural networks
with characteristics for learning and reacting, making them a popular technique
in classification problems in health systems and an emerging approach for
stress research. Stress models based on ANN are at the early stages of research
and have produced promising results. It has been claimed that an ANN is
better at recognising stress than humans from voice recordings [95] and this
result contributes to motivation for further stress research using ANN.
An ANN has the capability to learn patterns to recognise characteristics
in input tuples by classes. It is made up of interconnected processing elements,
known as artificial neurons, which are connected by weighted links that pass
signals between neurons. A group of neurons form a layer in an ANN. The
layers and neurons in each layer define the topology of a feed-forward ANN.
An ANN has an input layer, may have multiple hidden layers and an output
layer. Input tuples for the ANN are passed through the input layer. Then the
weighted links pass the weighted signals to the neurons in the hidden layers
which process the signals further and then in a similar fashion the signals
progress through the following layers. The processed signals are propagated
through the ANN in this fashion for the signals to reach neurons in the output
layer which causes the ANN to produce the output for the ANN. Essentially, a
signal is propagated through the ANN layer after layer. In addition, the
topology of the ANN can be designed to include a time-delay to exploit the
time-varying nature of the stress features. Choosing the appropriate number of

57

Chapter 2: Background
points in time for stress classification is another task that forms part of the
process for designing the topology. The topology is usually designed by a trial
and error process. Further, the topology may have an impact on the
performance for classification.
Choosing the number of hidden neurons and layers is a critical aspect in
defining the structure of an ANN. With a small number of hidden neurons, an
ANN will not be able to differentiate between complex patterns, which will
result in an underestimation of the actual trend. On the other hand, a large
number of hidden neurons could lead to a poor generalisation because of overparameterisation. The number of hidden neurons is usually obtained
empirically. In some situations the accuracy may be similar for different
topologies, for instance, the accuracy for the one and two hidden layers were
similar when classifying fatigue [181].
Multi-layered perceptrons, a type of ANN with multiple hidden layers,
have been used for stress classification [182]. Features from physiological
measures were used in the classification. Recurrent ANNs (RANN) have been
used to measure stress. A RANN is an ANN that contains feedback
connections. It has been claimed to be useful for retaining information of how
the previous sample was processed to process the current sample effectively. A
RANN based on labelled voice data for experiment participants playing a video
game has been developed [95]. Utterances were recorded when participants
answered questions while playing the video game.

2.12.5 Support Vector Machines
Stress models have also been developed using Support Vector Machines
(SVMs). SVMs can be used to classify linear and non-linear primary measures.
Provided a set of training samples, a SVM transforms the data samples to a
higher dimension with the aim to determine a separating hyper-plane that
partitions data by class or labels. An appropriate non-linear mapping can

58

2.12 Computational Techniques for Modelling Stress
separate two classes of data with a hyper-plane provided that the data has been
transformed to a satisfactorily high dimension. A hyper-plane is chosen based
on support vectors, which are training data samples that define maximum
margins from the support vectors to the hyper-plane to form the best decision
boundary. SVMs have been used to predict stress states using BVP, GSR, pupil
dilation and skin temperature data [18, 81]. Other research that has used SVMs
to model human states include agitation detection in dementia patients using
heart activity, GSR and skin temperature data [70] and emotion recognition
based on EEG data [132].

2.12.6 Bayesian Classification
Bayesian classifiers can predict class membership probabilities for given
samples. Such classifiers are based on Bayes’ theorem and have been used to
calculate posterior probabilities for stress states. Naive Bayesian classifiers have
been used to classify stress [80, 81], which assumes classes are independent. A
maximum posterior decision rule was used to classify features from physical
measures to stress classes: “Stress” and “Normal” [81]. Alternatively, Bayesian
belief networks or Bayesian Networks (BN) can be used when classes have
dependencies. A BN can be represented by a directed acyclic graph or
conditional probability tables to show joint conditional probabilities for
attributes or variables. Nodes in the graph depict variables and arcs portray
causality. A Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) has been used to model stress
[107]. Unlike a traditional BN, a DBN can show how properties of stress vary
over time.

2.12.7 Decision Trees
Decision tree classifiers, based on a divide-and-conquer approach, have been used
in stress classification. The structure of a decision tree is like a flowchart. Each

59

Chapter 2: Background
internal node represents some criteria or test to divide the input space into
regions, each branch denotes an outcome of the test, and each terminal node or
leaf represents a target class. Algorithms have been established to generate
decision trees [183]. Unknown samples are classified by starting at the root of
the tree and moving the sample towards the leaf after testing the sample against
the criteria at the internal nodes in the path.
Decision trees have been used to classify stress based on characteristics
in physiological measures (e.g. EEG [129]) and combinations of primary
measures (e.g. combination of BVP, GSR, pupil dilation and skin temperature
[81]). A potential problem with using decision trees to model stress is the crisp
splits for prediction. Future research could investigate softening the decision
process with the use of fuzzy techniques or some probabilistic framework.

2.12.8 Markov Chains and Hidden Markov Models
The Markov property is a time-domain process with conditional probability
density of the current event depending on the ith most recent event, given all
the past and present events. A Markov chain is the simplest form of a Markov
model. It models the state of a system with a random variable, which varies
with time, where a state is dependent on prior states. The system of a Markov
chain is fully observable. On the other hand, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is
a type of a Markov chain but, as its name suggests, it is partially observable.
Only the sequence of observations can be seen in HMMs. HMMs are a double
stochastic process with a Markov chain that has a finite number of states and a
set of functions that corresponds to each state. The process is in one state in the
system at a time and produces a symbol that is dependent upon a random
function for that state. The generalised topology of a HMM is a fully connected
structure where a state can be reached from any state.
In stress research, HMMs have been mainly used in recognising stressed
speech [162, 163, 166, 184]. HMMs have been used for modelling emotions from

60

2.13 Fusion of Computational Techniques
voice data as well [185]. Markov models, including dynamic-based and HMM,
have been used for behavioural recognition and prediction [148].

2.12.9 Fuzzy Techniques
Fuzzy-based techniques, in particular fuzzy clustering has been used to
measure stress. A fuzzy technique has used HR to model workload [186], which
is somewhat related to stress. In addition, fuzzy filters could be used to filter
out uncertainties in physiological measures of stress. A nonlinear fuzzy filter
for reducing random variations has been developed for heart rate signals [187].
Fuzzy clustering, a hybrid of fuzzy and clustering techniques, has been
used to determine stress based on HRV as a primary measure [26]. Unlike
traditional clustering where data elements belong to at most one cluster, fuzzy
clustering generates data clusters such that data elements can belong to more
than one cluster with different membership degrees. Each data element has a
set of membership level values giving the membership degrees.

2.13 Fusion of Computational Techniques
Hybrid techniques for stress models include an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference
system [36], a fuzzy clustering technique [26], and a technique combining WT
and ANN [174]. However, the number of hybrid techniques developed for
stress models are few and, in relation to the previous sections in this chapter,
there is scope for more hybrids. On the other hand, primary measures have
been modelled using many more types of hybrid techniques but not directed to
stress. These include modelling behaviour [146] and emotions [188]. A BN and
a HMM was fused for behavioural analysis and recognition [146]. They used
behavioural analysis to discover criminal activities by using scenes around the
airport especially for baggage handling. A possible extension of this research

61

Chapter 2: Background
could include determining whether an individual is stressed by analysing their
behaviour for example, modelling interviewee jitteriness during an interview.

2.14 Evaluation

of

Computational

Techniques

for

Modelling Stress
Not many comparisons have been done to evaluate stress models. In an
investigation for performance of stress models based on supervised learning,
SVM was claimed to be a superior technique to Naive Bayes and Decision Tree
classifiers [81]. To resolve the need for an evaluation of computational
techniques suited for modelling stress, this thesis presents an empirical ranking
of techniques used for modelling stress in Table 2.8 based on the discussions in
this chapter, comparisons and usage in the literature. The ranking has been
adopted in the literature [24].
Models of stress in the literature have used their own methods for
measuring stress and determining performance in stress detection. They do not
result in models for managing stress in typical real life situations. Despite the
differences in metrics, the models reported in the literature have performed
much better than chance, which suggest that stress can be successfully
modelled and that further research in this area will benefit the area on
modelling stress. This motivates the proposed research to objectively model
stress in the direction towards motivating the development of an objective
stress management system for use in real life situations. The problem
investigated in this research is on observer stress which is an instance of the
stress domain.

2.15 Summary
This chapter presented a survey for stress research particularly focussing on
computational stress and highlighted some of the gaps. It discussed and
evaluated the primary stress measures and computational techniques to model
stress, which are quite simplistic. The next chapter will use the primary stress
measures to propose a definition of computational stress, which will be used to
define computational observer stress, a focus of this thesis. The primary stress
measures and the computational techniques discussed in this chapter are used
in Chapters 4-6 to develop objective models of observer stress.
63

Chapter 2: Background

64

Chapter 3 Computational Observer Stress
This chapter* defines computational stress, which is based on the primary stress
measures defined in Chapter 2. It also provides the architecture of a
computational model of observer stress.

3.1 Background: Stress Scales
The literature has reported stress values on some ordinal scales to describe
different stress states. Stress in computer users has been classified as “Stressed”
or “Relaxed” [81]. Similar labels have been used for stress in computer game
players e.g. “No-Stress”, “Average” and “High-Stress” [129]. Stress levels in car
drivers have been classified into three different categories – low, medium and
high [17]. Data segments for low-stress were taken from rest periods, mediumstress segments were taken from uninterrupted highway driving, and highstress segments were taken from busy main street city driving. Due to the
uncertainties, the categories could be defined in terms of fuzzy sets. Future
research could propose standard categorical labels for stress that following
research can adopt.
Stress values have also been defined on a continuous scale. A continuous
scale for mental stress has been defined as 0-100, where higher values represent
increase in stress levels [26]. Further, stress values could be represented on a
time-varying scale where each time step has an associated stress value, which
could be used to summarise stress characteristics over time.

*

Portions of this chapter have been published in [24].

65

Chapter 3: Computational Observer Stress

3.2 Definition of Computational Stress
This thesis coins the term computed stress and defines it as the stress
computationally derived from instantaneous measures of stress symptoms
obtained by non-invasive methods. A computational model of stress will take
some combination of stress symptom measures as inputs to produce a
computed stress measure as an instantaneous measure of stress at that point in
time.
The literature suggests stress is defined as a self-reported measure (e.g.
self-assessment [189, 190]) or observer-reported measure (e.g. human behaviour
coder [17]). These reported measures are used to support stress measures
drawn from directly measuring stress symptoms, but do not give an
instantaneous stress measure.
The key difference is the assumption that our computed stress assumes
there is an underlying property called stress for which both the symptom
measurements and the reported measures are approximations. This allows us to
use both these sources of information in AI models to learn the underlying
model of true stress. Henceforth, we use our term, computed stress, and
distinguish it from the traditional overall stress measure. With the definition of
computed stress, stress can not only be compared across time but also across
multiple individuals. A consequence of such models is that the computed stress
will be statistically more reliable than individual reporting or symptom
measures.

3.3 Definition of Computational Observer Stress
There are various forms of stressors as defined in Section 2.3. Some situations
where stressors emerge are when playing video (action) games [75, 76], solving
difficult mathematical or logical problems [77], listening to energetic music [75],
conducting a surgical operation [22], driving cars [15-17] and flying airplanes

66

3.3 Definition of Computational Observer Stress
[20, 21]. Under all these circumstances, the literature has reported the effect of
stressors on individuals who interacted with stressors directly or were directly
involved in the situation and were in the environment. The stress of an
individual in such a context may influence the environment they are in because
they “interact” with a stressor. This thesis will investigate the effect of an
environment on an observer who observes the environment that has a stressor
stimulated by actors in the environment and where their stress does not
influence the environment – a novel area for stress research. The observer is
likely to engage emotionally and intellectually with the events in which they
are present albeit passively. This thesis coins the term observer stress to mean the
stress of an observer of such an environment that stimulates stress and the term
computed observer stress to mean computed stress of an observer.
An average person spends a significant amount of time observing
environments investigated by this thesis. According to a statistical report
published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2011 [191], approximately
87% of Australians spend about three hours per day on average watching the
television. The report also stated that approximately 44% of Australians read
for about 1.25 hours a day. The activity times were recorded outside paid work,
study, housework and unpaid community work periods. The average number
of hours spent on watching television per day by the people in the United
States of America and Canada were 4.75 [192] and 3.5 [193] respectively in 2012.

3.4 A Computational Model of Observer Stress
Before computational models can be implemented for observer stress, it is
necessary to define an architecture for the models. The architecture proposed
for a computational model of observer stress is presented in Figure 3.1. The
model captures the environment that a human observer sees, uses the human
response signals and their stress assessment of the environment to develop a
computational system to evaluate observer stress. Data processors and
optimisers in the model aim to make the architecture effective and scalable for
modelling stress. Details of the components in the architecture of the
computational model are provided below.

68

3.4 A Computational Model of Observer Stress

69

Chapter 3: Computational Observer Stress
Observer
A human observer will see events in an environment and show responses that
will be captured by physiological and physical sensors.

Environments
The thesis will investigate modelling observer stress for three different types of
environments, which are abstract virtual environments (text), virtual
environments (films) and real environments (i.e. environments with real life
humans interacting with one another).

Primary Measures
Human responses will be captured from observers while they see an
environment. The responses will include physiological signals (e.g. EEG, ECG
and GSR), physical signals (e.g. eye gaze and pupil dilation signals) and human
assessment for stress of the environment. The physiological and physical
signals will be sourced by sensors. Responses from surveys will be analysed to
determine the human assessment for stress of the environment.

Processors
The human responses captured will be processed using signal processing and
statistical techniques to develop stress features. The functions of the processors
include data alignment and synchronisation, data cleaning, data transformation
and feature extraction.

70

3.4 A Computational Model of Observer Stress
Optimiser
Features will be normalized and optimised with an aim for the computational
model to capture general stress patterns in the stress data. Normalized features
will reduce the effect of individual bias for individual-independent observer
stress models. Further, large numbers, in the order of thousands, of stress
features can be derived from primary signals to model stress. This set of
features may include redundant and irrelevant features which may outweigh
the more effective features showing stress patterns. Therefore, a stress optimiser
will make the observer stress model architecture more robust and scalable. The
stress feature optimiser system could be based on correlation based or
evolutionary algorithm based techniques.

Stress Model
A computational stress model will have a knowledge base of the stress patterns
in the stress data for observer stress recognition. The model could be based on a
classification technique such as a support vector machine. The ground truth
will be defined from the processed and optimised human assessment response
and will be used to determine the quality of the model.

Stress Evaluator
Observer stress will be recognised or evaluated using a stress model based on
the stress data.

71

Chapter 3: Computational Observer Stress

3.5 Stress Data
The objective stress data derived from primary stress signals will be used to
model observer stress. The primary signals are the physiological and physical
signals that are known in the literature to show symptoms of stress. An
observer will have stress feature values derived from their primary stress
signals for every environment they encounter. The signals will be sourced from
the observer while they see the environment over some period of time. The data
will be used to develop computational observer stress models.
Stress data for an observer is defined by stress features calculated from
primary stress signals over the time of an environment seen by the observer.
The features include statistic and measure values of the signal over certain time
segments. These statistic values include the mean, standard deviation, kurtosis,
skewness, interquartile range, minimum and maximum. Measures such as the
number of peaks for periodic signals, the distance an eye covered and the
proportion of the time the eye fixated on different regions of the environment
for eye gaze signals, and values from the power spectrum for HRV, BP and
EEG signals are also examples of stress features. Figure 3.2 shows a
visualisation of the stress data for an observer.

Chapter 4 Modelling Computational
Observer Stress for Abstract Virtual
Environments
This chapter* presents computational models of observer stress for abstract
virtual environments (AVEs). Chapter 1 established that stress is a part of
everyday life and should be controlled and managed. However before these
can be defined and measured objectively, research needs to develop an
objective understanding of how average individuals respond to stress in typical
activities like reading, which is a focus of this chapter. According to our
understanding, the literature has not reported stress analysis for reading, which
further motivates the research in the area. This chapter details a data collection
procedure for conducting a reading experiment for observer

stress.

Computational models of observer stress for AVEs are proposed and
developed using the collected observer stress data.

4.1 Data Collection
A reading experiment was conducted to acquire primary stress measures that
consisted of physiological and physical sensor data and human reported data.
The physiological signals obtained comprised of ECG, GSR and BP signals, and
the physical signals were the eye gaze and pupil dilation signals.
Thirty-five undergraduate students were recruited as experiment
participants. The participant cohort was made up of 25 males and 10 females
over the age of 18 years old. The mean age was 19.8 years old with a standard
deviation of 1.6.

Environments
Data was collected from participants in a lab room, which was made up
of two smaller rooms – Acquisition and Inquisition rooms. Each participant sat
in the Inquisition room to have their signals captured during set tasks while the
experiment instructor controlled the data collection and task settings from the
Acquisition room. Before the start of each experiment i.e. data collection
process from one participant, the lab room was set up with the temperature set
at 22°C, Acquisition and Inquisition computers with required applications
started, consent forms and assessment sheets placed at appropriate locations in
the room, and all sensor equipment initialized and ready to be attached to a
participant. The experiment instructor controlled the data acquisition, text that
participants had to read and the room settings of the Inquisition room from the
Acquisition room. The participant read text while their measurements were
recorded in the Inquisition room. A photo of the Inquisition room is presented

Each participant had physiological and physical measurements taken
over the 12 minutes reading time period. During the reading period, a
participant read stressed and non-stressed types of text validated by participants.
Stressed text had stressful content in the direction towards distress, fear or
tension. Each participant read three stressed and three non-stressed text. Each
text had approximately 360 words and was displayed on a computer monitor
for participants to read. For consistency, each text was displayed on a
1050 × 1680 pixel Dell monitor, displayed for 60 seconds and positioned at the
same location of the computer screen for each participant. Each line of the
paragraph had 70 characters including spaces. A schematic diagram of the
computer screen is given in Figure 4.3.
Physiological and physical sensor signals were captured from each
participant over the experiment time. The signals captured were GSR, ECG, BP,
eye gaze and pupil dilation signals. Biopac ECG100C, Biopac GSR100C and
Finapres Finger Cuff systems were used to take ECG, GSR and blood pressure
recordings at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The Biopac GSR100C system sourced
GSR data through disposable EL507 GSR electrodes, which were placed on the
first (or index) and fourth (ring) fingers of the participant’s left hand. The
sensors had to be attached to the participant 5 minutes before data acquisition
so that appropriate signals could be recorded. For acquiring ECG signals, the
Biopac ECG100C system was connected with disposable EL503 ECG electrodes,
which were placed on the participant’s left and right wrists. Further, the
Finapres Finger Cuff system was attached to the participant’s third (or middle)
finger of the left hand to acquire BP signals. Eye gaze and pupil dilation signals
were obtained using Seeing Machines FaceLAB system with a pair of infrared
cameras at 60 Hz. Unlike the method for capturing physiological signals,
acquisition of eye gaze and pupil dilation signals were not obtrusive because it
captured the signals through visual sensors. A schematic diagram of the
equipment setup for experiment is given in Figure 4.4.

stress classes for tasks [198]. Participants found the text labelled stressed as more

4.3 Observer Stress Feature Set
Other stress response signals were derived from the primary stress signals for
stress modelling. These derived signals included the heart rate variability
signal, which is another common signal used for stress detection [31, 106]. HRV
was calculated from consecutive ECG peaks. Other stress response signals that
were derived included the peak voltage difference signals for periodic primary
stress signals (- ECG and pupil dilation), gradient signals of the primary stress
signals and the derived signals.
Features were derived from the primary stress signals as follows. The
signals were segmented into 5 second intervals with an overlap of 50%. Statistic
and measure values of the segments formed the stress feature set. These
statistic values included the mean, standard deviation, kurtosis, skewness,
interquartile range, minimum and maximum. Measures such as the number of
peaks for periodic signals, the distance an eye covered, the number of forward
and backward tracking fixations, and the proportion of the time the eye fixated
on different regions of the computer screen over 5 second intervals were also
obtained. The regions of the computer screen are shown in Figure 4.3. The
feature values were normalized by individual to reduce the effect of individual
bias in generating an individual-independent observer stress recognition
model. There were 215 stress features in total.

4.4 Stress Models for an Observer
The aim for the work in this section is to determine whether an ANN based
model can be developed for an observer to recognise their stress in reading text
with stressful content. This section proposes and tests a variety of ANNs that to
classify stress in reading using a novel set of stress response signals. It also
proposes methods for ANNs to deal with large numbers of features derived

84

4.4 Stress Models for an Observer
from the response signals using a GA based approach. The three different types
of classification models were ANN-AllInputs, ANN-GAInputs and ANN-3SegGAInputs. Each model made use of a different facet of stress feature signals,
from determining features that produced better stress classifications to
exploiting time-varying characteristics for signals.

4.4.1 Computational Stress Classifiers
Three topologies were used to classify stress in reading. For two ANNs, a GA
was used to select stress features, which formed inputs to the ANNs. As a
consequence, the three ANNs differed only on the number of inputs used. The
ANNs were:
ANN-AllInputs: A feed-forward ANN was generated for each
participant. The ANN had 215 inputs, which mirrored the number of
features derived from the primary signals for stress.
ANN-GAInputs: This ANN was similar to ANN-AllInputs but the
number of inputs was based on the features selected by a GA. The GA
selected features to improve the classification rate for stressed and nonstressed states.
ANN-3Seg-GAInputs: An ANN was generated for each participant with
at most 10 features with 3 sequential time segments for each feature as
inputs to the ANN. Like ANN-GAInputs, the GA selected features to
improve the classification rate for stressed and non-stressed states.
GAs were used to improve stress classification by selecting relevant
features and to leave out corrupted features. For instance, ECG sensors
malfunctioned when acquiring ECG signals for participant with index 19, and
this corrupted corresponding features. This information was recorded during
data acquisition and can also be seen by viewing graphs of raw signals. With a

85

Chapter 4: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Abstract Virtual
Environments
GA, there is a better chance that the ANN classifiers will not use corrupted
features for developing relationships from features for stress classification.
A reason for selecting fewer features than the total number of features
for ANN-3Seg-GAInputs was to determine whether fewer features can be used
to successfully represent the feature space with a smaller network. In addition,
if all the features were used as inputs then, in total, the number of inputs would
have been 3-fold greater than ANN-AllInputs. Results from ANN-GAInputs
show that all 215 features were not needed for an ANN classification. Using
ANN-GAInputs, it was found that a smaller subset of features can produce a
classification with a better accuracy. This provided another motivation to use
fewer features as inputs in ANN-3Seg-GAInputs.
The data sets for each participant was divided into 3 subsets – training,
validation and test sets – where 50% of the data samples were used for training
the ANN and the rest of the data set was divided equally for validating and
testing the ANN.
MATLAB was used to implement and test the ANNs. The MATLAB
adapt function was used for training the ANN on an incremental basis. Each
network was trained for 1000 epochs using the Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm. The network had 7 hidden neurons and one neuron in the output
layer. Future work could investigate optimizing the topology of the ANN for
stress classification on the reading data set. The correct classification rates and
the F-Score values were calculated to determine the quality of the classification.
GAs were used to select features in ANN-GAInputs and ANN-3SegGAInputs based on quality measures for stress classification from ANNs. A GA
is a global search technique and has been shown to be useful for optimization
problems. Given a population of subsets of features, the GAs evolved the
feature sets by applying crossover, mutation and selecting feature sets during
each iteration of the search to determine sets of features that produced better
quality ANN classifications based on classification accuracy values using 10-

86

4.4 Stress Models for an Observer
fold cross-validation. The initial population for the GAs was set up to have all
the features. The number of features in the chromosomes varied but the
chromosome length was fixed. The length of a chromosome was equal to the
number of features in the feature space. A chromosome was a binary string
where the index for a bit represented a feature and the bit value indicated
whether the feature was used in the ANN. For ANN-GAInputs, the initial
population had features varying in numbers equally distributed from 1 to 215
features. On the other hand for ANN-3Seg-GAInputs, each chromosome in the
initial population had 5 features with feature values for 3 consecutive time
segments. The other parameters for the GA were set experimentally and are
provided in Table 4.1.

4.4.2 Performance of the Classifiers
Stressed and non-stressed states for participants were classified using ANNAllInputs, ANN-GAInputs and ANN-3Seg-GAInputs. The accuracy values for
the classification were calculated using 10-fold cross validation [183]. The

Environments
values are provided in Figure 4.6 for each experiment participant. The best
accuracy values were obtained from ANN-3Seg-GAInputs. The accuracy values
were significantly different for the three ANNs based on the statistical
Student’s T-test (p < 0.01).

ANN-AllInputs performed the worst compared to the other two ANNs.
This shows that the ANN is susceptible to features that were irrelevant and
redundant for stress classification. The performance for ANN-GAInputs, which
was better than ANN-AllInputs, confirmed this. It used features that were
optimised for stress classification. The ANN that exploited the time-varying
nature associated with stress features gave the best stress classification. Results
were significantly better for ANN-3Seg-GAInputs according to the statistical Ttest (p < 0.01). This showed that feature values for stress had information in the
patterns over time. It is a significant observation derived directly from the
ANN result.

computational models. This section proposes ANN and SVM based models for
observer stress recognition. It also investigates the performance of the model
with a GA as a feature selection method and a novel feature selection method,
PISA, which is based on pseudo-independence of features. An analysis of the
classification performances for the proposed classifiers is also presented.

4.5.1 Feature Selection Methods
The large number of features derived from the stress primary signals may have
had redundant data so a feature selection approach based on correlation
coefficients for features was developed to reduce the use of redundant features
to model observer stress. Correlation analysis using correlation coefficients has
been reported to detect some data redundancies as stated in Section 2.12.3.
A correlation coefficient is a measure for the strength of the linear
relationship between features. Consider two features, X and Y, with

and

values at time-step t in X and Y respectively,

and

and

the means and

are the standard deviations for X and Y, then the correlation coefficient

is

defined by

(17)

The values for

(18)

89

Chapter 4: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Abstract Virtual
Environments
If

= 0, then features X and Y are independent otherwise the features

are correlated. However, stress features may have noise originating from data
collection and the human body. In addition, the definition for independence of
features for stress classification may be too strict. This motivated the use of
different degrees for feature independence. In order to distinguish from
independence defined by the strict criteria, we coin the term pseudoindependence to mean independence at a certain degree. Suppose the degree of
independence is set at

≤ 0.1 and

is found to be 0.05, then features X and

Y are pseudo-independent. On the other hand if

is found to be 0.25, then

features X and Y are not pseudo-independent.
The pseudo-independent based feature selection method, pseudoindependent feature selection algorithm (PISA), was used to select stress features
that was provided as input to a classifier to detect stress patterns. Given a set of
features, each feature was compared with each of the other features to
determine whether they were not pseudo-independent features. Features and
their not pseudo-independent features were found and used to generate a set of
pseudo-independent features for classification. The process by which a set of
pseudo-independent features were obtained was by PISA. PISA is defined in
Figure 4.7.
Given a set of features and a set of features that are not pseudoindependent to each feature, PISA firstly finds features that are pseudoindependent to every other feature. Then it selects one feature from a cluster of
not pseudo-independent features. The feature selected from a cluster is based
on its not pseudo-independent features – the number of features and whether
the features have been already selected. Features with a higher number of not
pseudo-independent features have a greater chance of being selected. This
characteristic of PISA minimizes the impact of highly correlated noisy features
on classification.

Chapter 4: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Abstract Virtual

To illustrate PISA, consider an example input set comprising features and
the features that are not pseudo-independent to the features presented in
Figure 4.8. Firstly, PISA determines features that do not have any not pseudoindependent features. A set {f4} is the result at this point. Now, the rest of the
pseudo-independent features need to be appended to the set. There are
multiple possibilities and they are {f1, f3, f4} and {f2, f4}. After applying the
algorithm the result will be {f2, f4}, which is the smaller feature set of the
multiple feature sets with pseudo-independent features. This approach reduces
the risk of selecting features that were derived from corrupted sensor data and
negatively affect the performance for stress classification. Suppose the feature
set {f1, f2, f3} were derived from corrupted sensor data and if {f1, f3, f4} was
selected as a set of features for classification, then intuitively the possibility of a
classification model to capture better stress patterns would be lower than if {f2,
f4} was chosen instead.

4.5 Individual-Independent Stress Models
Another feature selection method used for observer stress classification
was based on a GA. A GA is a global search algorithm that was used to select
features to improve the quality of stress classifications. The GA search evolved
a population of subsets of features using crossover, mutation and selection
operators in search for a population of subsets of features that produced a
better quality stress classification model. A subset of features is referred to as an
individual or chromosome. The quality for each chromosome in the population
was defined by the quality of classifications produced when a classifier was
provided with the features in the chromosome.
The initial population for the GAs had all the features. The number of
features selected in the chromosomes varied but the chromosome length was
fixed. The length of a chromosome was equal to the number of features in the
feature space. A chromosome was a binary string where the index for a bit
represented a feature and the bit value indicated whether the feature was used
in the classification. The parameter settings for the GAs were the same as in
Section 4.4.1 and the implementation settings provided in Table 4.1.

4.5.2 Computational Stress Classifiers
Classification models developed for stress pattern recognition from primary
stress signals were based on an ANN and a SVM. The models were extended to
incorporate feature selection phases either using the PISA or GA methods. Each
classification model was defined to capture individual-independent stress
patterns. The accuracy and F-Score values were calculated for each model to
determine the quality of the classifications.
The stress reading data set was divided into 3 subsets – training,
validation and test sets – where 50% of the data samples were used for training
a classification model and the rest of the data set was divided equally for
validating and testing the model. MATLAB was used to implement and test the
models.

93

Chapter 4: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Abstract Virtual
Environments
For the ANN based classifier, three topologies were used to classify
observer stress for reading. Each of the ANNs was provided stress features as
inputs based on a selection method. Therefore, the ANNs differed only on the
number of inputs. The ANN based stress classification models were:
ANN: an artificial neural network classification model that was
provided with all the features in the stress feature set as input to
recognize stress patterns
PISA-ANN: ANN with inputs as features produced by PISA
GA-ANN: ANN with inputs as features produced by a GA
The MATLAB adapt function was used for training the ANNs on an
incremental basis. Each network was trained for 1000 epochs using the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The network had 7 hidden neurons and one
neuron in the output layer.
Hybrids of SVM with PISA or GA were used to deal with ineffective
features for stress modelling and investigate whether the hybrids with feature
selection methods improved the quality of the observer stress classification. The
SVM based observer stress classification models developed were:
SVM: a support vector machine classification model that was provided
with all the features in the stress feature set as input similar to the ANN
PISA-SVM: SVM with inputs as features produced by PISA
GA-SVM: SVM with inputs as features produced by a GA
The architectures for GA-ANN and GA-SVM are shown in Figure 4.9.

4.5.3 Performance of the Classifiers
The six ANN and SVM based techniques were implemented and tested on the
data set obtained from the reading experiment for observer stress recognition.
Classification results were obtained using 10-fold cross-validation. The results
are presented in Table 4.2. Classifiers with feature selection methods performed
better than classifiers that used all stress features to model stress patterns. The
hybrid classifiers had correct classification rates and F-score values that were at
least 8% and 12% better respectively. Classifiers with a GA as the feature
selection method produced the highest accuracy with GA-SVM as the best
performing technique.

Performance measures for the classification techniques show that it was
beneficial to use the feature selection methods to model stress patterns in
reading. The stress features would have had redundant features and PISA
would have reduced it. PISA compared every feature to every other feature in a
pair-wise fashion and took a greedy approach in selecting features. Unlike

96

4.5 Individual-Independent Stress Models
PISA, the GA took a global view of the features and would have managed to
exclude more redundant, irrelevant and corrupted features.
In terms of execution time, the GA based approaches, GA-ANN and GASVM, took longer times than the other techniques to produce solutions. It took
PISA less than one second to select the features for the classification models
whereas the execution times for the GA based approaches were in the order of
hours. Classification without a feature selection method or with PISA took
quite a similar amount of time. Empirical execution times for the different
approaches are shown in Table 4.3.
The execution times for GA based approaches were recorded after the
search reached convergence except for GA-ANN, which took substantially
longer to execute. GA-ANN took at least 3 days and it took the other techniques
not more than a few hours to produce a solution. Therefore, it was not practical
to let the GA-ANN search execute for longer. Table 4.2 and Table 4.3 have a *
with the values to show results at the point when the GA-ANN search was
terminated.

Due to the relative long execution times for the GA based approaches to
search for a better stress classification result, other feature selection approaches
should be investigated in the future. With shorter execution times and good
classification performance results for classifiers using PISA, PISA has the
potential to increase the performance for classifications. In future, PISA based
97

Chapter 4: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Abstract Virtual
Environments
classifiers could be extended to have a more complex definition for pseudoindependence.
ANN and SVM based classification results using PISA over a range of
degrees of pseudo-independence were also obtained to determine the effect of
the different degrees of pseudo-independence on the classification results. The
results are displayed in graphs shown in Figure 4.10. The graphs show the
accuracy and F-score values along with the number of features for the different
degrees of pseudo-independence. For both, ANN and SVM, the plot for the
classification results show a positive overall rate of change and then it becomes
negative after 0.5 degree of pseudo-independence. The best classification
results are produced when the degree of pseudo-independence is 0.5. At this
degree, every feature is pseudo-independent at the degree of 0.5 to every other
feature in the set of features used as input to develop the ANN and SVM
classification models.

4.6 A Stress Model System with Feature and Model
Selection
Large numbers of stress features can be derived from primary stress signals
and it is important to select an appropriate subset of features to model stress
that provides higher quality observer stress recognition results as evident in
Section 4.5. In addition, it is a challenge to select an appropriate computational
classification model with optimal parameters to capture general stress patterns.
The aim of this section is to determine whether stress can be detected from
individual-independent computational classification models with a GA based
optimisation scheme. The GA is used to select appropriate stress features, select
a type of classifier and optimise the classifier’s parameters for observer stress
recognition. The different types of classifiers used are an ANN and a SVM.

4.6.1 A Hybrid Genetic Algorithm Stress Model
The performance of classification models depends on the inputs provided, as
investigated in Sections 2.12.3, 4.4 and 4.5, and also on model parameter
settings. Hybrid GAs have been presented in the literature that selected
features for SVM based classification and optimized SVM parameters for
various applications such as bankruptcy prediction [199], microarray analysis
[200], intrusion detection [201]. GA and ANN hybrid methods with feature
selection and parameter optimization has also been developed (e.g. weight
optimization [202]) including applications in gear fault detection [203] and
retail credit risk assessment [204]. The methods used in the literature used
different applications, different parameters for optimisation and different
features for selection from the ones presented in this thesis.
The type of stress models and parameters for the stress models in the
literature as stated in Section 2.12, were chosen using trial-and-error processes.
100

4.6 A Stress Model System with Feature and Model Selection
In this section, a GA method is proposed that selects a better model for stress
classification and optimises parameters for the models. For reference,
conventional GAs were described in Section 2.12.3. The quality of a
chromosome in the GA in this section was defined by the accuracy, sensitivity,
specificity and the F-score values of the stress classifications derived from the
classifier, its parameters and a subset of stress features encoded by the
chromosome.
A description for an ANN was given in Section 2.12.4. The layers and
neurons in each layer define the topology of a feed-forward ANN. An ANN has
an input layer, may have multiple hidden layers and an output layer. Input
tuples for the ANN are passed through the input layer. Then the weighted links
pass the weighted signals to the neurons in the hidden layers which process the
signals further and then in a similar fashion the signals progress through the
following layers. The processed signals are propagated through the ANN in
this fashion for the signals to reach neurons in the output layer which causes
the ANN to produce the output for the ANN. Essentially, a signal is
propagated through the ANN layer after layer. In addition, the topology of the
ANN can be designed to include a time-delay to exploit the time-varying nature
of the stress features. Choosing the appropriate number of points in time for
stress classification is another task that forms part of the process for designing
the topology. The topology is usually designed by a trial and error process, as it
will in general have an impact on the classification performance. The approach
proposed in this section aims to optimise the topology for stress classification.
Conventional SVMs were described in Section 2.12.5. There are a range of
parameters that need to be chosen to define a SVM. The GA hybrid in this
section focuses on selecting and tuning the kernel function for selecting an
optimal hyper-plane.
With the hundreds of stress features and the numerous options for
settings for the stress classification models, a GA was used to find an optimal
subset of features and search for a classifier that could best capture stress

101

Chapter 4: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Abstract Virtual

patterns from the features. Three different GAs, GA-ANN, GA-SVM and GAANN-SVM, were developed for stress classification. They differed in the type
of classification model used to define stress recognition in the search and the
type of chromosome. The chromosomes had components for features and
parameters for classification models. Each type of chromosome was a binary
string and represented the features and the parameters for the classification
model. In the component of the chromosome that encoded the features, the
index for a bit represented a feature and the bit value indicated whether the
feature was used in the classification. For the components that encoded the
parameter value, the binary string was treated as a binary number which was
converted to its equivalent decimal number to extract the value for the
component. The hybrid GAs are defined as follows:

GA-ANN. The GA used an ANN for stress classification. The
chromosome encoded the following components:


Stress features



Number of hidden layers (ANN)



Number of neurons in the first hidden layer (ANN)



Number of neurons in the second hidden layer (ANN)



Number of neurons in the third hidden layer (ANN)



Time-delay (ANN)

GA-SVM. The GA used a SVM for stress classification. The chromosome
encoded the following components:


Stress features



Type of kernel function: The bit value represented polynomial or
Gaussian radial basis function. (SVM)



Type of method: The bit value represented quadratic programming
or sequential minimal optimization method. (SVM)

102

4.6 A Stress Model System with Feature and Model Selection


Degree for the polynomial kernel function (SVM)



Sigma value for the Gaussian radial basis function (SVM)

GA-ANN-SVM. The GA used an ANN or a SVM for stress classification
depending on the value for chromosome component that encoded the
type of classification model. The chromosome in this search is essentially a
chromosome combination made up of the chromosomes in GA-ANN and
GA-SVM and encoded the following components:


Stress features



Type of classification model: the bit value represented ANN or
SVM



Number of hidden layers (ANN)



Number of neurons in the first hidden layer (ANN)



Number of neurons in the second hidden layer (ANN)



Number of neurons in the third hidden layer (ANN)



Time-delay (ANN)



Type of kernel function: The bit value represented polynomial or
Gaussian radial basis function. (SVM)



Type of method: The bit value represented quadratic programming
or sequential minimal optimization method. (SVM)



Degree for the polynomial kernel function (SVM)



Sigma value for the Gaussian radial basis function (SVM)

Some components in the chromosomes for the GA hybrids are analogous
to recessive genes in the biological domain. For GA-ANN, the chromosome
component that provided the value for the number of hidden layers was used
to determine whether the chromosome components that encoded the number
of hidden neurons for each of the hidden layers were needed to be interpreted.
For instance, if the number of hidden layers was interpreted to be 2, then the
components that encoded the number of neurons in the first and second hidden
layers were interpreted to define the ANN for classification and the component
103

Chapter 4: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Abstract Virtual
Environments
that encoded the number of neurons for the third hidden layer was not used.
Likewise for GA-SVM, the component for the degree for the polynomial
function was interpreted only if the polynomial function was selected as the
kernel function i.e. the value for component that encoded the type of the kernel
function was the polynomial function. Alternatively if the Gaussian radial basis
function was selected, the sigma value for the Gaussian radial basis function
was interpreted to define the SVM. GA-ANN-SVM was implemented in a
similar fashion with the addition of the chromosome component that provided
which type of classifier to use. If ANN was selected, then only the components
that encoded the settings for ANN were interpreted and the components for
SVM settings were not interpreted and similarly if SVM was selected then the
SVM setting components were interpreted and ANN setting components were
not interpreted.
The architecture for the GA hybrid algorithms is shown in Figure 4.11.
The parameter settings in Table 4.1 were used to implement the GA to select an
optimised model and features for observer stress classification.

4.6.2 Performance of the Hybrid Genetic Algorithm Stress Model
Hybrid GAs were developed and tested on the reading data set for observer
stress classification. The stress classification results achieved by an ANN, SVM
(from Section 4.5) and the different GA hybrids based on ANNs and SVMs are
presented in Table 4.4. For convenience, the results for ANN and SVM were
copied from Table 4.2 to Table 4.4. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to
calculate the performance for the classifications. Overall, the GA hybrids
produced better classification results than methods that did not use a GA to
select appropriate stress features and optimize parameter settings for
classification models to capture stress patterns. GA-SVM and GA-ANN-SVM
produced the best classification results with accuracy values of 98%. It suggests
that this accuracy is the best result achievable for stress classification in reading
based on an ANN or SVM. The accuracy values for GA hybrids were at least
21% greater than the rates produced by classification methods without a GA.

stress patterns for reading. Using all the features for stress classification, like for
the ANN and the SVM methods, would have included redundant and
irrelevant features which may have outweighed the important features for
observer stress recognition. The GA hybrids reduced the redundant and
irrelevant features to develop stress classifiers.
Execution times were recorded for the methods while they were tested
on the reading data set. The execution times for each method are shown in
Table 4.5. GA-ANN and GA-ANN-SVM took several days to produce a result,
which was a lot longer than the other methods. The execution time for GA-SVM
was in the order of hours.

In terms of quality of stress classifications produced and the amount of

classification methods with the highest accuracy and was not the worst in terms
of the execution time.

4.7 Optimal Time Segments for Stress Detection
Some stress response signals over some time segments may not be relevant for
analysis and modelling due to the lack of data patterns they offer. These signals
could contribute to lower quality stress classification results, inefficient

107

Chapter 4: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Abstract Virtual

processing and may impose large demands on storage resources. The work in
this section proposes an approach to search for relevant time segments from
human response signals, particularly physiological and physical signals to
recognise observer stress. This section proposes an approach to determine time
segments that were critical to differentiate the types of text based on stress. A
SVM is used to classify the different types of text based on the features of the
response signals. Further, a SVM and GA hybrid approach is developed to
determine optimal time segments for stress detection (OTSSD). As well as
optimising time segments, the GA also deals with hundreds of stress features
that may have included redundant and irrelevant features.

4.7.1 Motivation for Optimal Time Segment Selection
To determine the state of a person in a given circumstance, human response
signals are captured over some time period. However, the signals over the total
time period may not be necessary for processing to extract patterns for
detecting the state and it may be possible that a smaller segment of the total
time period may contain the data sufficient for analysis and modelling.
Analysis of the smaller segment could result in significant improvement in
efficiency because the effect of irrelevant or redundant data on the analysis will
be reduced.
Several computational techniques already reported in the literature can be
used to select relevant and optimal time segments, but they are not useful for
cases when relationships between the characteristics of signals and their
features characterizing the human state that needs to be identified are not
known. Visual inspection could be used to support selection of a more optimal
time segment as reported in the literature [205]. The visual analysis may be
difficult and could be prone to errors. For a problem like stress recognition,
several response signals need sourcing and analysis. This poses a major

108

4.7 Optimal Time Segments for Stress Detection
technical challenge as little information is available on how the various signal
combinations can be decoded and how the features affect stress recognition.
Feature extraction methods including cluster analysis provide amenable
methods to extract and use optimal patterns from time segments. These time
segments should be optimally selected, and some human intervention may still
be required.

4.7.2 A Genetic Algorithm Based System for Feature and Time
Segment Selection
GAs have been widely used for optimisation problems [206]. Details of a GA
were provided in Section 2.12.3. This work used a GA for stress feature
selection and proposes a GA based approach to find stress episodes in the
reading data set.
A chromosome either represented time segments as candidate stress
episodes, a subset of features from the set of all stress features or a combination
of both. Conventionally, a chromosome has encoding for one type of a solution
e.g. features [168]. For this section, the goal was to find stress episodes and
features over the stress episodes that produced better stress recognition results.
Hybrid chromosomes have been developed and used in the literature as
discussed in Section 4.6. Reportedly, this approach has not been particularly
used for encoding signals and time segment data.
Each chromosome in the hybrid GA was a binary string of fixed length.
For the chromosome that encoded features only, which is denoted by CF, the
chromosome contained information for all the features in the space of all stress
features. The index of the chromosome represented a feature and its value
indicated whether the feature was used in the classification to define the
corresponding model. The length of the chromosome was equal to the number
of stress features. There were three different ways in which time segments were
encoded. A time segment chromosome had one of the following definitions:
109

Chapter 4: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Abstract Virtual
Environments
CTS. An index of the chromosome represented a time segment of the
total reading time. The value for the index represented whether the
feature values over the corresponding time segment was used in the
classification.
COTS. A chromosome that had overlapping time segments where an
index of the chromosome represented a time segment of the total
reading time. Similar to C-TS, the value for the index represented
whether the feature values over the time segment was used in the
classification.
CTTS. A chromosome that had the start and end times of a time segment.
Stress feature values over the time segment were used in the
classification.
Another type of chromosome was developed that had encodings for
both features and time segments. The classification model was defined by the
feature values during the time segments depicted in the time segment encoding
component of the chromosome. There were three variations for this type of
chromosome and they differed on the time segment encoding component:
CF-TS. A composite structure with encodings for features and time
segments of the total reading time. An index of time segment encoding
component of the chromosome represented a time segment in the total
reading time and its value represented whether the feature values in the
feature encoding component was used in the classification.
CF-OTS. A composite structure with encodings for features and
overlapping time segments of the total reading time. An index of time
segment encoding component of the chromosome represented a time
segment in the total reading time and its value represented whether the

110

4.7 Optimal Time Segments for Stress Detection
feature values in the feature encoding component was used in the
classification.
CF-TTS. A composite structure with encodings for features and start and
end times of a time segment. The definition for time segment encoding
component was based on CTTS. Feature values depicted by the feature
encoding component over the time segment was used in the
classification.
A stress recognition approach consisting of a hybrid of a GA and SVM
was used to determine OTSSD. The GA searched for stress episodes based on
the quality of the stress classifications produced by the SVM given subsets of
stress features and time segments over the reading time. The GA provided a set
of features over GA selected time segments to the SVM to determine the quality
of stress classifications and evolved the set of features and time segments in
search for stress episodes.
To obtain stress classification results from a SVM, the stress reading data
set was divided into 3 subsets – training, validation and test sets – where 50%
of the data samples were used for training the SVM model and the rest of the
data set was divided equally to validate and test the model. MATLAB was used
to implement and test the models. The parameters for the GA implemented
were set as provided in Table 4.1.

4.7.3 Critical Time Segments from the Genetic Algorithm System
The GA-SVM hybrid approach was implemented using each of the different
chromosomes to search for stress episodes in reading. GA-SVMs with CTS, COTS,
CF-TS and CF-OTS were implemented with different time segment intervals. The
interval sizes were chosen based on the time segment size for feature extraction,
which was 5 seconds and detailed earlier in Section 4.3. The GA provided
multiple time segments at the end of the GA search from which the longest

111

Chapter 4: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Abstract Virtual
Environments
time segment that was defined by the multiple consecutive time segment
intervals was chosen as a stress episode. Results of the GA and SVM approach
using the different types of chromosomes to search for OTSSD are presented in
Table 4.6. The interval length for a time segment in each of the chromosomes
CTS, COTS, CF-TS and CF-OTS is depicted by i seconds in CTS_i, COTS_i, CF-TS_i and CFOTS_i

respectively.

Chapter 4: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Abstract Virtual
Environments
Participants of the reading experiment were given 60 seconds to read a
text excerpt. Results in Table 4.6 show that stress episodes in the reading data
appeared within a smaller segment of the total reading time in particular, they
appeared around 15-30 seconds. During this time interval, the SVM produced
the highest accuracy values. Figure 4.12 shows the number OTSSD searches
that produced stress episodes during various time intervals of the total reading
time. Each OTSSD search used one type of chromosome listed in Table 4.6. The
distribution of the number of OTSSD searches show that most of the searches
produced stress episodes between 15-30 seconds.
Searches for OTSSD that optimized features produced better accuracy
values than searches with chromosomes that only optimized time segments.
The searches that optimized features had chromosomes that had a feature
encoding component. The average accuracy value for the searches that
optimized features was 0.92 whereas the average accuracy value for the
searches without feature optimization was 0.85. Without feature optimization,
redundant features and features irrelevant to SVM based stress recognition
may have existed. These features were reduced with the use of a GA in search
for OTSSD, which produced a better accuracy. The best accuracy was 99% and
it was produced by the OTSSD search that optimized features and found a
stress episode during the 15-30 reading time interval.
OTSSD searches with chromosomes with time segment intervals that
evolved the start and end times of the time segment interval and time segments
with relatively short time intervals, in particular 5 seconds, found stress
episodes with higher accuracy. Using chromosomes CTTS and CF-TTS in the
search that evolved the start and end times for candidate stress episodes
provided more flexibility in the search for OTSSD because the search space was
less constrained. Chromosomes with time segments that had 5 second intervals
also had similar characteristics. On the other hand, the design for other
chromosomes made it difficult or impossible for the OTSSD search to find
stress episodes with higher accuracy.

To relate the time interval for stress episodes found by the OTSSD
searches to an average reading excerpt in the experiment, average eye fixations
of participants in relation to the reading display during the reading time are
presented in Figure 4.13. According to the stress episode for reading,
participants read approximately a third of the text before the start of the stress
episode. They read over half of the text in total by the end of the stress episode.
Investigation of the content of a text excerpt with division of text by content
and its relationship with stress was beyond the scope for this work. Future
research could investigate what divisions of a text excerpt caused stress
episodes.

4.8 Summary

4.8 Summary
In this chapter, details were presented for the experiment that was conducted to
collect a real-life observer stress data set for AVE and the various
computational models developed for observer stress in AVE. Models proposed
were successfully developed for individual observers and models that captured
stress patterns across the observers were also developed. The modelling
systems that had a feature selection component produced better quality
observer stress classification results. Classification results were obtained from
SVM and ANN based classifiers and features were selected using a GA based
approach. Results show that model using features optimised by GAs helped to
select salient features for stress classification, dealt with irrelevant, redundant
and corrupted features, and provided better classifications than the models that
did not use feature selection. A GA based modelling system that selected an
appropriate set of features and a classifier with optimised parameter settings
was successfully developed as well.
A feature selection method based on correlation analysis was developed
and compared with the GA based feature selection method on classification
results. The correlation analysis based feature selection method produced better
quality classification results than models without feature selection, but
produced worse results than GA based models. On the other hand, the GA
based models required longer execution times but the correlation based feature
selection method hardly had any impact on the execution time.
A computational approach for optimal time segments for stress detection
(OTSSD) was developed to determine optimal time segments, or stress
episodes, with the aim of obtaining better stress classification results. The
corresponding model also optimised stress features. A GA and SVM based
hybrid technique was developed where the GA searched for stress episodes
and optimised stress features based on the classification results produced by
the SVM.

117

Chapter 4: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Abstract Virtual
Environments
From the different types of models developed in this chapter, the GA
and SVM hybrid model produced the best stress classification results. In
particular, the model that optimised stress features and time segments
produced the best results. As a consequence, the GA and SVM hybrid model
will be used to model observer stress for virtual environments and real
environments.
In summary, the research contributions of this chapter are:


A real-world stress data set for observer stress for AVE;



Stress analysis from a novel set of primary stress signals;



Computational models for an observer stress for AVE;



Individual-independent computational models for observer stress for
AVE; and



A novel method for optimising time segments for stress detection.

Chapter 5 Modelling Computational
Observer Stress for Virtual Environments
This chapter* proposes computational models of observer stress for virtual
environments (VEs). The models for VEs use the definition of observer stress
and the architecture of the observer stress model presented in Chapter 3. This
chapter details the experiments designed and conducted to obtain observer
stress data sets for VEs for the computational models. It also presents an
investigation for modelling stress with primary stress signals sourced by
contact sensors and non-obtrusive sensors and provides an analysis of the
results.

5.1 Data Collection
Two experiments were conducted to collect primary stress signals of observers
of virtual environments. One of the experiments was similar to the experiment
for stress data collection for AVE presented in Section 4.1 because it acquired
ECG, GSR, BP, eye gaze and pupil dilation signals. The experiment for VE also
acquired EEG signals. The other experiment conducted for VE captured videos
in visible and thermal spectrums, EEG, GSR, eye gaze and pupil dilation signals
using non-obtrusive methods, unlike the experiment that used contact sensors
for data acquisition. These sensors need to be attached to an individual at
particular regions of the body and the person has to minimise their movement
during data acquisition. The contact sensors had a higher sampling rate than
the non-obtrusive sensors. The two experiments were similar in that they both
had the same virtual environments and that EEG, eye gaze and pupil dilation
signals were acquired using the same equipment.

Portions of this chapter have been published in [207, 208].

Chapter 5: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Virtual Environments

5.1.1 Data Collection Using Contact Sensors
Twenty five undergraduate students were recruited as experiment participants.
The participant cohort was made up of 15 males and 10 females between the
ages of 18 and 30 years. The mean age was 24.3 years old with a standard
deviation of 2.2.
Similar to the experiment detailed in Section 4.1, before the start of each
experiment, the lab room was set up with the temperature set at 22°C,
Acquisition and Inquisition computers with required applications started,
consent forms and assessment sheets placed at appropriate locations in the
room, and all sensor equipment initialized and ready to be attached to a
participant. The lab room is made up of two smaller rooms – Acquisition and
Inquisition rooms. The experiment instructor controlled the data acquisition,
films that participants watched and the room settings of the Inquisition room
from the Acquisition room. The participant watched the film clips and had their
measurements recorded in the Inquisition room.
The process of the experiment followed by the participant was also similar
to the experiment in Section 4.1. Each participant had to understand the
requirements of the experiment from a written set of experiment instructions
and what was involved in the experiment with the guidance of the experiment
instructor. The experiment information sheet and the consent form are
provided in Appendix B. After providing their consent to participate in the
experiment, the experiment instructor attached ECG, GSR, BP and EEG sensors
to the participant and calibrated the eye tracking sensors. The participant was
seated in front of a TFT-LCD display screen, which was placed between two
speakers of the surround sound system. The distance between the screen and
subject was in the range between 70 and 90 cm. The instructor started the films,
which triggered a blank screen with a countdown of the numbers “3”, “2” and
“1” transitioning in and out slowly, one after the other. The reason for the
countdown display and the blank screen was for participants to move away

120

5.1 Data Collection
from their thoughts at the time and get ready to pay attention to the films that
were about to start. This approach was used in experiments for similar work
done in the literature [209]. Subsequent to the countdown display, a blank
screen was shown for 15 seconds, which was followed by a sequence of film
clips with 5 second blank screens in between. The film clips were made up of
stressed and non-stressed films and each film was approximately one minute in
length. After the films finished, the participant was asked to do an assessment
on the films to validate the film labels. The assessment questions are given in
Appendix B. In total, the experiment took approximately thirty minutes.
Film clips were categorized by the type of environment they created.
Stressed films had stressful content in the direction towards distress, fear and
tension whereas the non-stressed films had content that created an illusion of
meditation or soothing environments. There were three stressed films and three
non-stressed films. For consistency, the films were displayed on a 1050 x 1680
pixel LCD Dell monitor and positioned at the same location of the computer
screen with a surround sound system for each participant.
Primary stress signals were captured using the same method and
equipment detailed in Section 4.1. Additionally, EEG signals from the Emotiv
EPOC device was obtained as well. The signals were captured at a sampling
rate of 128 Hz.
A schematic diagram of the equipment setup for the film experiment is
provided in Figure 5.1. The experiment instructor controlled the film clips that
the experiment participant watched from the Acquisition computer. The
computer was also used to control the participant’s response signal acquisition
and synchronize the signals while the films were shown to the participant.
Acquisition software applications for eye tracking and EEG signals required
relatively greater amounts of computer memory and processing. In order to
ensure that it did not affect the acquisition of the other signals, there was a
computer designated for eye tracking signal acquisition and another computer
for EEG signals.

5.1 Data Collection

5.1.2 Data Collection Using Non-Obtrusive Sensors
An experiment was conducted to collect videos in thermal spectrum (TS) and
visible spectrum (VS) of faces, and EEG, GSR, eye gaze and pupil dilation
signals of individuals while they watched films. The aim for the experiment
was similar to the experiment detailed in Section 5.1.1 in that it was conducted
to collect data for observer stress analysis for VE, but this experiment also had
the aim to minimise obtrusiveness of the method in which stress data was
collected.
Thirty-five graduate students consisting of 22 males and 13 females
between the ages of 23 and 39 years old volunteered to be experiment
participants. The mean age was 29.1 years old with a standard deviation of 2.4.
Each participant followed the same experiment process as the experiment
conducted with contact sensors. Details of that experiment process were
provided in Section 5.1.1.
While a participant watched the film clips, TS and VS videos of their faces
and EEG, GSR, eye gaze and pupil dilation signals were recorded. A schematic
diagram of the experiment setup is shown in Figure 5.2. The method used to
capture EEG, eye gaze and pupil dilation signals in the experiment detailed in
Section 5.1.1 was the same method used to collect the primary stress signals in
this experiment. In addition, GSR signals were sourced by the BodyBugg
system developed by SenseWear with a sampling rate of 0.0167 Hz. TS videos
were captured using a FLIR infrared camera model SC620 and VS videos were
recorded using a Microsoft Webcam. Both the videos were recorded with a
sampling rate of 30 Hz and the frame width and height were 640 and 480 pixels
respectively.
The primary stress signals for this experiment were sourced using less
obtrusive sensors than the method detailed in the experiment detailed in
Section 5.1.1. The limitations on participants minimising movement in Section
5.1.1, due to the attachment of wired physiological sensors, did not arise here.

123

Chapter 5: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Virtual Environments
In this experiment, the only sensors that needed to be attached to the
participant were the Emotiv EPOC headset, which is a headband, and the
BodyBugg armband. These systems were wireless.

Figure 5.2: Setup for the film experiment to collect facial video data in thermal
and visible spectrums, and EEG, GSR, eye gaze and pupil dilation signals

For each participant, a TS and VS video was recorded for each film they
watched. As a consequence, a participant had six video clips made up of three
stressed videos and three not-stressed videos. Note the usage of the terms film
and video. The term, film, is used to refer to a virtual environment or video
showing some content, colloquially called a “film” or “movie”, which a
participant watched during the experiment. The term, video, is used to refer to a
visual recording of a participant’s face and its movement during the time
period while they watched a film. Thus in this thesis, a film is a virtual
environment which is watched, whereas a video is a recording of the observer
participating in an experiment, who may be watching a film.

5.2 Evaluation of the Environments for Observer Stress
Results from the experiment survey validated the film classes. In addition, the
film classes were also validated by another forty people giving a total of 65
people who did the survey. Analysis of survey responses is a common method
used in the literature to validate stress classes for tasks [198]. Participants found
the films that were labelled stressed created stressful environments for the
viewers and films labelled non-stressed created environments that were not
stressful in accordance with the distribution of survey question responses
presented in Figure 5.3 and with a statistical significance of p < 0.001 according
to the Wilcoxon test.

A breakdown of the results from the Wilcoxon statistical test for the difference
in survey responses for stressed and non-stressed types of films for each survey
question is presented in Table 5.1. Participants provided responses to survey
questions for stressed and non-stressed types of films and the responses
showed that the different types of films were statistically significantly on all
questions apart from question (b) can the film help you unwind after a busy
day? Several participants wrote comments in the Other Comments section of
127

Chapter 5: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Virtual Environments
the survey mentioning that the non-stressed films were boring and such films
would not help them unwind after a busy day. These participants indicated in
their responses that the stressed films would help them unwind after a busy
day. It may have been that they usually watched stressed films to submerge
their emotions and intellect in the events of stressed virtual environments to
unwind after their busy day. In addition, the definition of a busy day for a
participant may vary across participants. For some participants, a busy day
may mean an emotional and intellectually draining day but for others it could
mean a physical draining day. Since this question was ambiguous for validating
the film labels it was not considered further.

5.3 Observer Stress Feature Set

5.3 Observer Stress Feature Set
A feature set was developed from the primary stress signals obtained from the
experiments. Features from ECG, GSR, BP, eye gaze and pupil dilation signals
were obtained using the method that was implemented to extract features from
the primary stress signals for observers in AVE. Refer to Section 4.3 for details
for the feature extraction from the primary stress signals. Features derived from
EEG signals included statistic features of signals in different frequency bands
and measurements for Hjorth parameters and fractal dimensions. Definitions
for EEG frequency bands, Hjorth parameters and fractal dimensions were
provided in Section 2.6.3.
Facial regions in VS videos were detected using the Viola-Jones face
detector. Due to the different nature of TS videos from VS videos, the ViolaJones algorithm was not appropriate for extracting facial regions, so a face
detection method based on eye coordinates [210, 211] and a template matching
algorithm was used. A template of a facial region was developed from the first
frame of a TS video. The facial region was extracted using the Pretty Helpful
Development Functions toolbox for Face Recognition [210-212], which
calculated the intraocular displacement to detect a facial region in an image.
This facial region formed a template for facial regions in each video frame of the
TS videos, which were extracted using MATLAB’s Template Matcher system
[213]. The Template Matcher was set to search the minimum difference pixel by
pixel to find the area of the frame that best matched the template. Examples of
facial regions that were detected in the VS and TS videos for a participant are
presented in Figure 5.5.

Chapter 5: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Virtual Environments
The literature claims that features from segmented image blocks of a
facial image region can provide more information than features directly
extracted from an image of a full facial region in VS [214]. Examples of full
facial regions are shown in Figure 5.5 and blocks of a full facial region are
presented in Figure 5.6. To illustrate the claim, features from each of the blocks
used in conjunction with features from the other blocks in Figure 5.6(i) can offer
more information than features obtained from Figure 5.5(a)(i). The claim aligns
with the results from classifying stress based on facial thermal characteristics
[215]. As a consequence, the facial regions in this work were segmented into a
grid of 3 × 3 blocks for each video segment, or facial volume, forming 3 × 3
blocks. A block has X, Y and T components where X, Y and T represent the
width, height and time components of an image sequence, respectively. Each
block represented a division of a full facial block region or facial volume. LBPTOP features were calculated for each block.

5.3 Observer Stress Feature Set
LBP-TOP is the temporal variant of local binary patterns (LBP). In LBPTOP, LBP is applied to three planes, XY, XT and YT planes to describe the
appearance of an image, horizontal motion and vertical motion respectively.
For a centre pixel Op of an orthogonal plane O and its neighbouring pixels Ni, a
decimal value is assigned to it:

(19)

According to a study that investigated facial expression recognition
using LBP-TOP features, VS and near-infrared images produced similar facial
expression recognition rates, provided that VS images had strong illumination
[216]. LBP-TOP features have been mainly extracted from image sequences of
people told to show some facial expression, which is not like the image
sequences obtained from our film experiment. In our film experiment,
participants watched films and involuntary facial expressions were captured.
The recordings may have more subtle facial expressions of the kind of facial
expressions analysed in the literature using LBP-TOP. In addition, it is not
known in the literature whether LBP-TOP is able to capture necessary patterns
as effectively from TS images as VS images [217]. With the subtleness in facial
movement and the different nature of TS images to VS images, it is possible that
LBP-TOP may not be able to offer as much information for stress analysis.
These points motivate the development of a new set of features that exploits
thermal patterns in TS videos for stress recognition. This thesis proposes a new
type of feature for TS videos that captures dynamic thermal patterns in
histograms (HDTP). This feature makes use of thermal data in each frame of a
TS video of a face over the course of the video.
HDTP captures normalized dynamic thermal patterns, which enables
individual-independent stress analysis. Some people may be more tolerant to
some stressors than others [218, 219]. This could mean that some people may
133

Chapter 5: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Virtual Environments
show higher degree responses to stress than others. Additionally in general, the
baseline for human response can vary from person to person. To consider these
characteristics in features used for individual-independent stress analysis, ways
have been developed to normalize data for each participant for their type of
data [17]. HDTP is defined in terms of a participant’s overall thermal state to
minimize individual bias in stress analysis.
A HDTP feature is calculated for each facial block region. Firstly, a
statistic (consider the standard deviation) is calculated for each facial region
frame for a participant for a particular block (e.g. facial block region situated at
the top right corner of the facial region in the XY plane) for all the videos. The
statistic values from all these frames are partitioned to define empty bins. A bin
has a continuous value range with a location defined from the statistic values.
The bins are used to partition statistic values for each facial block region where
the value for each bin is the frequency of statistic values in the block that falls
within the bounds of the bin range. Consequently, a histogram for each block
can be formed from the frequencies. An algorithm presenting the approach for
developing histograms of dynamic thermal patterns in thermal videos for a
participant who has a set of facial videos is provided in Figure 5.7.

Chapter 5: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Virtual Environments
As an illustration, consider that the statistic used is the standard deviation
and the facial block region for which we want to develop a histogram is
situated at the top right corner of the facial region in the XY plane (FBR1) for
video V1 when a participant Pi was watching film F1. In order to create a
histogram, the bin locations and sizes need to be calculated. To do this, the
standard deviation needs to be calculated for all frames in FBR1 in all videos
(V1-12) for Pi. This will give standard deviation values from which the global
minimum and maximum can be obtained and used to calculate the bin location
and sizes. Then, the histogram for FBR1, for V1, for Pi, is calculated by filling the
bins with the standard deviation values for each frame in FBR1. This method
then provides normalised features that also take into account the image and
motion, and can be used as inputs to a classifier.

5.4 Observer Stress Models Using Stress Response
Signals Sourced by Contact Sensors
The main aim for the work in this section is to determine whether observer
stress for VE could be recognised using individual-independent computational
models from sensor based stress response signals. ECG, EEG, GSR, BP, eye gaze
and pupil dilation signals are used. EEG signals were acquired using a
consumer sensor device, so another aim is to determine whether the consumer
sensor device can be used to source EEG signals for stress recognition.
EEG signals are generally captured by equipment that is obtrusive and
requires a relatively higher degree of intrusion (e.g. EEG sensors with electrical
conductivity gel needs to be attached to particular positions of a subject’s head),
relatively long set up time and experimenters that are experienced with the use
of the equipment. These factors contribute to lower number of participants in

experiments and motivated us to use the Emotiv EPOC consumer device.
Emotiv is portable, nonintrusive, easier to use and cheaper – the Emotiv
136

5.4 Observer Stress Models Using Stress Response Signals Sourced by Contact Sensors
headset with EEG sensors (and costs approximately $300 USD). Unlike
conventional EEG recording equipment, which has multiple wires that needs to
be managed, Emotiv is wireless. However, Emotiv has fewer sensors (14
channels) and a lower sampling rate (128 Hz) than the conventional EEG
recording equipment which can have from 32 to 256 sensors and a sampling
rate of at least 240 Hz to 16,000 Hz [220, 221].

5.4.1 Stress Classification Systems
The stress classification models were based on a SVM and an ANN. A GA and
SVM hybrid (GA-SVM) and a GA and ANN hybrid (GA-ANN) models were
also developed with the aim to use features, which were more relevant for
stress recognition and reduce feature redundancy to optimise stress
classification. The GA based models were motivated from the performance of
the models with optimisation for abstract virtual environments in Chapter 4,
which reported that GA based models produced more superior stress models
compared to stress models based on correlation methods. The architecture for
the SVM, ANN, GA-SVM and GA-ANN systems were defined as in Section
4.5.2. Feature values derived from ECG, EEG, GSR, BP, eye gaze and pupil
dilation signals were provided as input to the classification systems.

5.4.2 Performance of the Classification Systems
The computational classification models were tested on the stress data obtained
from the experiment that used contact sensors to collect primary stress signals.
Feature values derived from the primary stress signals were provided to the
SVM, ANN, GA-SVM and GA-ANN classification systems. The feature values
were normalized by participant to reduce the effect of individual bias.
Performances of the classifications produced the classification systems were

137

Chapter 5: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Virtual Environments
calculated using 10-fold cross validation. The classification results are provided
in Table 5.2.

Stress patterns in the film data set were best recognized with the GA
hybrids according to the measures for stress classification. When the
classification model systems were provided all the features derived from the
primary stress signals, the correct classification rates and the F-score were at
least 0.24 lower than systems with the GA feature selection. Classification
results show that the performances of SVM and ANN were similar. Similarly,
the performances of GA-SVM and GA-ANN in stress classification were
similar.
The stress feature values provided to SVM and ANN included
redundant and irrelevant features which outweighed the more effective
features showing stress patterns. However, the GA based models optimised the
features and produced models that captured more general stress patterns. Thus,
the GA based methods produced higher accuracy values.
The GA in the GA hybrid classification systems selected ECG features for
measurements of the LF and HF frequency bands, gradients, rate of change,
mean and variance for GSR, ECG and BP, rate of change of the distance covered
138

5.4 Observer Stress Models Using Stress Response Signals Sourced by Contact Sensors
by eye gazes calculated by eye fixations, and the rate of change of the diameter
size of the eye pupil. This feature subset had stress data on how the experiment
participants reacted to the different films and provided improved capability for
the classification systems to capture better stress patterns in the film experiment
data set and recognize stress better.
Further, EEG features were provided as input to the SVM, ANN, GASVM and GA-ANN classification systems as well. The classification results
based on 10-fold cross validation are shown in Table 5.3.

Like the performance of the classification systems on the primary stress
signals, GA hybrids produced better accuracy and F-score values than the
systems that used all features to develop a model. This shows that the GA
hybrids captured stronger stress patterns in their models. The accuracy values
for the systems without the GA was at least 0.16 lower than the GA hybrid
systems. In addition, SVM and ANN produced similar accuracy values and the
GA hybrids produced classifications with similar accuracy values.
The GAs selected measures for EEG fractal dimensions, and variance,
mean and skewness features of the EEG signals and signals in the Beta and
Alpha frequency bands for stress classification. The features selected by the
GAs had stronger relationship with stress and enabled the classifiers in the

139

Chapter 5: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Virtual Environments
classification system to better capture stress patterns in the film experiment
EEG data set.
Statistical analyses were conducted on the results and in accordance with
the Student’s T-test the GA hybrid systems produced significantly better
accuracy values than the systems without the GA with p < 0.01. Analysis of the
accuracy values produced by systems on the feature sets derived from primary
stress signals and the EEG signals showed no statistical difference for the two
feature sets (p > 0.1). This suggests that the EEG Emotiv system has the
capability to capture stress signals and has the potential to be used for stress
recognition in environments where intrusion needs to be minimized for easier
stress data acquisition.

This section investigates whether signals sourced by non-obtrusive sensors can
be used to model stress. As an initial step in computer vision based stress
detection, the work in this section aims to determine whether a stress
classification system for an observer of VE can be developed using data from
VS and TS videos.

5.5.1 Stress Classification Systems
The stress classification systems developed were based on either a SVM only or
a hybrid of a GA and a SVM (GA-SVM). SVMs have been widely used in the
literature to develop models for facial expression recognition [216, 222, 223].
Details of conventional SVMs were provided in Section 2.12.5.
It has been reported in the literature that thermal patterns for certain
regions of a face provide more information for stress than other regions [215].
The performance of the stress classifier can degrade if irrelevant features are
140

5.5 Observer Stress Models Using Thermal Facial Patterns
provided as inputs. As a consequence and due to its benefits noted in the
literature, the classification system was extended to include a feature selection
component, which used a GA to select facial block regions appropriate for the
stress classification. GAs are inspired by biological evolution and the concept of
survival of the fittest. A GA is a global search technique and has been shown to
be useful for optimization problems and problems concerning optimal feature
selection for classification [224].
Given a population of subsets of facial block regions with corresponding
features, a GA was defined to evolve sets of blocks by applying crossover and
mutation operations for diversity in the search, and selecting block sets during
each iteration of the search to determine sets of blocks that produce better
quality SVM classifications. Each block set was represented by a binary fixedlength chromosome where an index or locus symbolized a facial block region,
its value or allele depicted whether or not the block was used in the
classification and the length of the chromosome matched the number of blocks
for a video. The search space had 3 × 3 blocks (as shown in Figure 5.6) with an
addition of blocks that overlapped each other by 50%. The parameter settings
for the GA implemented for facial block region selection was the same as the
GA settings used for the GA hybrid system in 4.4. The GA parameter settings
were provided in Table 4.1.
In summary, various stress classification systems using a SVM were
developed which differed in terms of the following input characteristics:


VSLBP-TOP: LBP-TOP features for VS videos



TSLBP-TOP: LBP-TOP features for TS videos



TSHDTP: dynamic thermal patterns captured in histograms using
statistics for TS videos

These inputs were also provided as inputs to the GA-SVM classification
systems to determine whether the system produced better accuracy values.

5.5.2 Performance of the Stress Classification Systems
Each of the different features derived from VS and TS facial videos using LBPTOP and HDTP facial descriptors were provided as inputs to a SVM for stress
classification. Facial videos of participants watching stressed films were
assigned to the stressed class and videos associated with not-stressed films
were assigned to the not-stressed class. Furthermore, their corresponding
features were assigned to corresponding classes. Recognition rates and F-scores
for the classifications were obtained using 10-fold cross-validation for each type
of input. The results are shown in Figure 5.8.

Results show that when TSHDTP was provided as input to the SVM
classifier there were improvements in the stress recognition measures. The best
recognition measures for the SVM were obtained when VSLBP-TOP + TSHDTP was
provided as input. It produced a recognition rate that was at least 0.10 greater
than the recognition rate for inputs without TSHDTP where the range for
recognition rates was 0.13. This provides evidence that TSHDTP had a significant
contribution towards the better classification performance and suggests that
TSHDTP captured more patterns associated with stress than VSLBP-TOP and TSLBPTOP.

The performance for the classification was the lowest when TSLBP-TOP was

provided as input.
The features were also provided as inputs to a GA which selected facial
block regions with a goal to disregard irrelevant facial block regions for stress
recognition and to improve the SVM based recognition measures. Performances
of the classifications using 10-fold cross-validation on the different inputs are
provided in Figure 5.8. For all types of inputs, GA-SVM produced significantly
better stress recognition measures. According to the Wilcoxon non-parametric
statistical test, the statistical significance was p < 0.01. Similar to the trend
observed for stress recognition measures produced by the SVM, TSHDTP also
contributed to the improved results in GA-SVM. The best recognition measures
were obtained when VSLBP-TOP + TSLBP-TOP + TSHDTP was provided as input to the
GA-SVM classifier. The performance of the classifier was highly similar when it

144

5.6 Summary
received VSLBP-TOP + TSHDTP as inputs with a difference of 0.01 in the recognition
rate. Results show that when a combination of at least two of VSLBP-TOP, TSLBPTOP

and TSHDTP was provided as input, then it performed better than when only

one of VSLBP-TOP, TSLBP-TOP or TSHDTP was used.
Further, stress recognition systems provided with TSHDTP as input
produced significantly better stress recognition measures than inputs with
TSHDTP replaced by TSLBP-TOP (p < 0.01). This suggests that stress patterns were
better captured by TSHDTP features than TSLBP-TOP features.
In addition, blocks selected by the GA in the GA-SVM classifier for the
different inputs were recorded. When VSLBP-TOP was given as inputs to a GA,
the blocks that produced better recognition results were the blocks that
corresponded to the cheeks and mouth regions on the XY plane. For VSLBP-TOP,
fewer blocks were selected and they were situated around the nose. On the
other hand for TSHDTP, more blocks were used in the classification - nose, mouth
and cheek regions, and regions on the forehead were selected by the GA. Future
work could extend the investigation by more complex block definitions to find
and use more precise regions showing symptoms for stress for classification.

5.6 Summary
This chapter proposed computational models of observer stress for VE based on
real-world data sets. The models were based on SVMs and ANNs and
developed from primary stress signals captured either by contact sensors or
non-obtrusive sensors. Stress patterns in the data were successfully captured by
the SVM and ANN models. The hybrids of GA with SVM and GA with ANN
performed significantly better than the stress recognition systems without a GA
with higher stress recognition results.
Analysis of the results produced by the stress recognition systems on the
data sourced by the consumer EEG device shows potential for the device as a
tool for stress analysis for the type of work presented in this chapter.

145

Chapter 5: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Virtual Environments
Additionally, a new method for capturing patterns in thermal videos
was defined – HDTP. The approach reduced individual bias in the
computational models and enhanced individual-independent recognition of
symptoms for stress. For computing the baseline for stress classification, a SVM
was used. Facial block regions selected informed by a genetic algorithm
improved the rates of the classifications regardless of the type of video – videos
in TS or VS. The best recognition rates, however, were obtained when features
from TS and VS videos were provided as inputs to the GA-SVM classifier. In
addition, stress recognition rates were significantly better for classifiers
provided with HDTP features instead of LBP-TOP features for TS.
In summary, the research contributions of this chapter are:


A real-world stress data set for observer stress for VE;



Stress analysis from a novel set of primary stress signals;



Computational models for observer stress for VE;



Computational model architectures that can be successfully used to
model observer stress for both AVE and VE;



A comparison of primary stress signals sourced by contact sensors and
non-obtrusive sensors gave no significant difference on the performance
to model stress between signals sourced by the two sources; and



A novel method to capture stress features from videos in the thermal
spectrum.

Chapter 6 Modelling Computational
Observer Stress for Real Environments
This chapter* proposes computational models of observer stress for
environments with real life settings. It details an experiment which was
conducted to collect a novel set of primary stress signals sourced by nonobtrusive sensors suited to observers of a real environment. The primary stress
signals and sensors were chosen based on the performance of models for
observer stress classification, as tested on the data sets in Chapter 4 and
Chapter 5. Observer stress classification models for real environments are
developed and tested on the collected real world data sets. Additionally, this
chapter proposes a computational stress signal predictor system that provides an
objective stress measure that varies with time.

6.1 Data Collection
Two experiments were conducted to collect real-world observer data sets for
RE. The experiments differed on the type of real-life setting for the observer,
who was the experiment subject. One experiment had an interview setting
(Interview experiment) and the other experiment had a meditation setting
(Meditation experiment). Each experiment had a scripted role-play to create a
consistent real world environment that an observer viewed while they had their
EEG signals, GSR signals and thermal videos recorded. EEG signals were
sourced using the Emotiv system, GSR signals were sourced by the BodyBugg
system developed by SenseWear and thermal videos were captured using the
FLIR infrared camera model SC620. EEG signals were sourced at a sampling
rate of 128 Hz, thermal videos were sampled at 32 Hz with the frame width and

Portions of this chapter have been published in [225, 226].

147

Chapter 6: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Real Environments
height of 640 and 480 pixels respectively and GSR signals were sourced with a
sampling rate of 0.0167 Hz.
Each experiment took approximately 30 minutes which included a roleplay that took 15 minutes. A role-play was acted out by six people. There were
one or more viewers of the environment who took notes of the environment and
watched the role-play just like the observer. The viewers’ reports, which are
provided in Appendix C, validated the stress classes for the environments.
Before the start of each experiment, the observer and viewer(s) had to
understand the requirements of the experiment from a written set of
experiment instructions and what was involved in the experiment with the
guidance of the experiment instructor. The experiment information sheet and
the consent form are provided in Appendix C. After providing their consent to
participate in the experiment, the experiment instructor attached EEG and GSR
sensors to the observer and calibrated the thermal camera. The viewer was
provided with a questionnaire that they filled in during the experiment to
validate the stress state during the different stages of the role-play. The
experiment instructor signalled the actors to start the role-play.
In total, there were 25 observers who had their stress signals recorded
and 40 viewers. The observer cohort was made up of 10 males and 15 females
between the ages of 16 and 25 years. The mean age was 18.6 years old with a
standard deviation of 2.1. There were 12 observers for the Interview experiment
and 13 observers for the Meditation experiment.

6.1.1 Data Collection for the Interview Environment
The Interview experiment had an interview setting with the aim of stimulating
a stressful environment. The interview role-play had five Interviewers who
interviewed one Interviewee for a hypothetical job position. The Interview
Observer and the Interview Viewer watched the interview with the aim to
determine

the

Interviewee. This was a mechanism to ensure the Interview Observer and the
Interview Viewer focus on the environment during the experiment. The setup
of the Interview experiment is presented in Figure 6.1.
The results from the survey completed by the Interview Viewers were
used to define stress classes for the different stages of the role-play. This was
also done to assess stress classes for the meditation role-play in the Meditation
Experiment. Analysis of survey responses is a common method used in the
literature to validate stress classes for tasks [198]. The role-play was divided
into 7 stages of approximately equal time. Only the viewer knew about the
stages so that they could fill in the questionnaire for the different stages.

6.1.2 Data Collection for the Meditation Environment
The environment for the Meditation experiment had the aim of stimulating a
calm environment. For the meditation role-play, there was a Meditation
Conductor, who led the meditation by reading out a meditation script that the
five Meditation Clients had to listen to and follow.
The experiment instructor provided tasks to the Meditation Observer
and the Meditation Viewer to watch the meditation and determine which client
meditated the most. This was a mechanism to draw their attention away from
the Meditation Conductor and not act like one of the Meditation Clients – that
is, to avoid taking part in the meditation and meditating themselves. Figure 6.2
shows the setup for the Meditation experiment.

6.2 Evaluation of the Environments for Observer Stress

6.2 Evaluation of the Environments for Observer Stress
Survey results showed that earlier stages of the interview were more tense or
stressful and as the interview progressed through the later stages, the interview
environment became less stressful. The first stage was the most stressful and
the last stage was the least stressful with p < 0.01 according to the Wilcoxon
statistical test.
Results from the survey on the meditation environment were used to
define stress classes for the different stages of the role-play. The approach for
obtaining the results was the same as the approach taken to analyse the survey
responses from the Interview experiment. Viewers found that the level of stress
that the meditation created reduced as the meditation went into the later stages.
The results showed that observing the last stage of the meditation was the least
stressful. According to the Wilcoxon statistical test, the viewers found the first
two stages of the meditation more stressful compared to all the other stages and
they found the last two stages as not stressful with p < 0.01.

6.3 Observer Stress Feature Set
Features were derived from the stress sensor signals, which formed inputs to an
observer stress classification model. The feature set included temporal features
of the physiological signals and spatio-temporal features of faces captured by
thermal video. Thermal videos of observers’ faces were divided into salient
volumes where each volume had some section of facial regions (e.g. midforehead) in time series, which formed signals for feature extraction. The
signals were segmented into 5 second intervals with an overlap of 50%. Statistic
and measure values of the segments formed the stress feature set. These statistic
values included the mean, standard deviation, kurtosis, skewness, interquartile
range, minimum and maximum. Features derived from EEG signals also
included statistics of signals in different frequency bands and measurements for

153

Chapter 6: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Real Environments
Hjorth parameters and fractal dimensions. The EEG features were detailed in
Section 2.6.3. There were 1379 features in total.
For a thermal video of an observer’s face during the course of the
experiment, facial regions in the video were extracted and divided into sections
as in Figure 6.3. A face detection method based on eye coordinates [210, 211]
and a template matching algorithm was used to extract a face region. The
method was the same as in Section 5.3. A template of a facial region was
developed from the first frame of a thermal video of the observer’s face. The
facial region was extracted using the Pretty Helpful Development Functions
toolbox for Face Recognition [210-212], which calculated the intraocular
displacement to detect a facial region in an image. This facial region formed a
template for facial regions in each video frame of the thermal videos. Facial
regions in each frame was extracted using MATLAB’s Template Matcher
system [213]. The Template Matcher was set to search for the minimum
difference pixel by pixel to find the area of the frame that best matched the
template.
The facial regions extracted from a video were split into different sections.
Grouped and arranged in order of time of appearance in a video, the sectioned
face regions of video frames formed volumes. Statistics were calculated for each
volume segmented into 5 second intervals like the other stress signals. An
example of a thermal facial volume with a volume of a section of the facial
region is shown in Figure 6.3.

6.4 Observer Stress Models
The stress classification models were built using features derived from the
stress response signals of observers during the experiment. There were two
types of classification models – a SVM model and a hybrid of a GA and SVM
(GA-SVM). The GA based model was motivated from the performance of the
models with optimisation for abstract virtual environments in Chapter 4, which
reported that GA based models produced more superior stress models
compared to stress models based on other optimisation methods. The GA in
GA-SVM optimised stress features for the SVM classification. Details of a SVM
155

Chapter 6: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Real Environments
were provided in Section 2.12.5. A description of a GA and its role as a feature
selection component in modelling systems were presented in Section 2.12.3. The
parameter settings for the GAs were the same as Section 4.4.1 and the
implementation settings were provided in Table 4.1.
Features were provided as inputs to each of the classification models for
stress recognition. The feature values were normalised by individual to reduce
the effect of individual bias in generating an individual-independent observer
stress recognition model.

6.5 Performance of the Stress Models
SVM and GA-SVM were implemented and tested on the data sets obtained
from the Interview and Meditation experiments. The primary stress signals for
observers were provided as input to the classification systems. A classification
system generated a feature set and built a classification model using the feature
set. The performance of the model was evaluated using the correct classification
rate and F-score based on 10-fold cross-validation in recognizing two stress
classes – stressed and not-stressed classes – from the test input data. The first two
stages of the environments were labelled as stressed and the last two stages were
labelled as not-stressed in accordance with the results of the survey responses.
Stress classification results produced by the SVM and GA-SVM systems are
presented in Table 6.1.

Recognition rates were significantly better when feature selection was
incorporated in stress classification system according to the Student’s T-test
(p < 0.01). In addition, results for the classification systems show that observers
showed characteristics in their physiological and physical response signals that
were different during the different times of the environment. The patterns in
the response signals in the earlier stages of the environments were different to
the patterns in the later stages.
The classification systems were provided stress response signals
categorized by the type of environment setting – interview or meditation
setting. Classification results for the environment setting based on the response
signals of observers are provided in Table 6.2.

The classification systems captured better observer stress patterns to
distinguish whether the observer was stressed during a particular stage of an
environment (the performance results are summarised in Table 6.1) than
classification systems that distinguished whether the observer was viewing an
157

Chapter 6: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Real Environments
Interview or Meditation environment (the performance results are summarised
in Table 6.2). Statistical analysis showed that observer stress classification
recognition rates were better for classification systems that classified stress
classes based on the stage of the environment (p < 0.05). Results from Table 6.1
and Table 6.2 also show that stress patterns of observers were common for a
particular stage of the environment irrespective of the environment setting. For
future work, stress signals could be modelled for more than two environments
and investigation can be done to determine whether stress patterns captured in
some of the environments can be used to recognize stress in other
environments. Future work could also investigate developing models that
provide better classification rates to recognize environments that observers
viewed using stress response signals from observers.
Stress response signals obtained from the Interview experiment was
modelled using the SVM and GA-SVM classification systems with the first two
stages of the interview environment labelled as stressed and the last two stages
labelled as not-stressed. Results for the performance of the classification systems
are given in Table 6.3.

Similarly, the stress response signals for the observers of the Meditation

For the different environment stages, the classification systems captured
better stress patterns for the meditation environment than the interview
environment (p < 0.01). This is the case because the meditation environment
might have influenced the stress levels for observers more over the course of
the environment than the interview environment. The results correlate with the
experiment survey responses, which show that the change in stress for the
meditation environment was greater than the interview environment.
Feature sets selected by the GAs in the GA-SVM classification systems
showed that the EEG band power feature was common to all the feature sets.
This suggests that the band power feature had a stronger relationship with
stress classes than other types of features used in this section. SVM and GASVM were modelled with the EEG band power features only and their
performance results for observer stress recognition are given in Table 7. The
stress recognition results could not be differentiated from the results obtained
from the GA-SVM classification systems for the investigations done to report
results in Tables 3-6 (p > 0.1).

6.6 Observer Stress Signal Predictor
In this section, a computational stress signal predictor system is proposed to
predict the stress signal for observers of the meditation environment. The
individual-independent system is based on a SVM, a hybrid of GA and SVM
model (GA-SVM) and an ANN. It used physiological and physical sensor
response signals for stress of observers over the time of the meditation activity.
SVM based classification models were developed to determine the overall trend
of the stress signal i.e. whether stress was increased or decreased over time for
individuals. The GA-SVM model system was used to optimize features for
stress classification. An ANN based modelling method is proposed to model a
stress signal informed by the overall trend given by the stress classification
models and using the optimised features as input.

160

6.6 Observer Stress Signal Predictor

6.6.1 Computational Classification Models to Determine the
Trend of the Stress Signals
Stress classification models were built using stress features to provide
information on the overall trend of the stress signal for observers. The features
were defined in Section 6.3. There were two types of classification models – a
SVM model and a hybrid of a GA and SVM (GA-SVM). Features were provided
as inputs to each of the classification models. The classification models were
built to classify stress in two classes – most-stressed and least-stressed classes.
Details of a SVM were provided in Section 2.12.5. From the analysis of the
results in Section 6.5 of using a GA for feature selection in stress classification
systems, the GA-SVM model was used to reduce the redundant and irrelevant
features in the input feature set for classification using the SVM model. A
description of a GA and its role as a feature selection component in modelling
systems were presented in Section 2.12.3 and its architecture was given in
Figure 4.9. The GA-SVM model was also used to obtain optimised stress
features for predicting a stress signal. The parameter settings for the GA in GASVM were the same as Section 4.4.1 and the implementation settings were
provided in Table 4.1.

6.6.2 A Computational Model for Estimating a Stress Signal
This section proposes an ANN feed-forward based computational system to
estimate a stress signal for observers of the meditation environment. A
description of the ANNs was provided in Section 2.12.4. A feed-forward ANN
has an input layer, may have multiple hidden layers and an output layer where
each layer is made up of neurons. Input tuples for the ANN are passed through
the neurons in the input layer. Then the weighted links pass the signals to the
neurons in the hidden layers which apply a nonlinear activation or transfer
function to process the signals further and then in a similar fashion the signals

161

Chapter 6: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Real Environments
progress through the following layers. Until the signals reach neurons in the
output layer which causes the ANN to produce output.
The results from the stress classification models, which are discussed in
detail in Section 6.6.3, mirrored the experiment survey responses in that the
earlier stages of the environment were found to be more stressful than the later
stages. As a result, it was envisaged that the overall trend of the stress signal for
an observer for the duration of the environment to have stress decreasing over
time. Thus, curves formed by a linear function, symmetric saturating linear
function or hyperbolic tangent function are some examples of the functions that
the stress signal could resemble. The various basic forms that the stress signal
could take are presented in Figure 6.4.

Chapter 6: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Real Environments
ANNs were developed that took the optimised stress features found from the
GA-SVM model in Section 6.6.1 as input with the aim to produce a signal that
took the form of either a linear function, symmetric saturating linear function or
a hyperbolic tangent function. Three different types of ANNs were developed
and they differed on the type of desired output estimator function as provided
below:
ANN_Linear: the ANN had a linear desired output estimator function
ANN_SLin: the ANN had a symmetric saturating linear desired output
estimator function
ANN_Tanh: the ANN had a hyperbolic tangent desired output
estimator function
The MATLAB adapt function was used to train the ANNs on an
incremental basis. Each network was trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm for 1000 epochs or until the magnitude of the gradient for the mean
squared error (MSE) was less than 10-5 during the validation phase. The MSE is
the average squared error determined from the actual output of the network
and the expected output. The number of neurons in the input layer for each
ANN was equal to the number of optimized features obtained from the GASVM system and each ANN had 7 hidden neurons and one neuron in the
output layer. If all the stress features had been provided as input to the ANN,
then the network would have become unnecessarily large requiring longer
times for executing ANN training and testing phases and contribute to
capturing poorer stress patterns to predict a stress signal. During the training
phase, an ANN was presented with a data sample which had stress feature
values as input and an estimate value on the curve of the function for a
particular time segment. The point of training using this desired output
estimator is that the ‘time’ values of instantaneous stress were not known as
only a few human provided labels which related to many stress feature values.
164

6.6 Observer Stress Signal Predictor
Training to the different curves enabled determining whether a representation
could be formed which well relates the data to the curve.

6.6.3 Performance of the Stress Signal Predictor
SVM and GA-SVM systems were implemented and tested on the data sets
obtained from the meditation experiment. The primary stress signals for
observers were provided as input to the classification systems. A classification
system generated a feature set and used it to build a classification model for
stress. The performance of the model was evaluated using the correct
classification rates and F-score values based on 10-fold cross-validation in
recognizing two stress classes – most-stressed and least-stressed classes – from the
test input data. The first two stages of the environments were labeled as moststressed and the last two stages were labeled as least-stressed in accordance with
the results of the survey responses. Stress classification results produced by the
SVM and GA-SVM systems are presented in Table 6.4.

Feature sets selected by the GA in the GA-SVM classification systems
showed that the EEG band power features made up most of the optimized
feature set. This suggests that the band power feature had a stronger
relationship with stress classes than other types of features used in this section.
The SVM system was modeled with the EEG band power features only and its
performance results for observer stress classification are given in Table 6.4. The
stress classification results of the SVM that had EEG band power features
provided as input could not be differentiated from the results obtained from the
GA-SVM classification system on all stress features i.e. SVM with stress features
optimized by a GA (p > 0.1).
EEG band power features were used to predict the stress signal for
observers of the meditation environment. The features were provided as input
to the three ANN stress signal predictors - ANN_Linear, ANN_SLin and
ANN_Tanh. Each type of ANN was trained and tested on experiment subject
data on a leave-one-out basis so the ANN would predict a stress signal for one
subject after being trained on data for the other subjects. The average MSE
calculated for each of the ANNs based on the values on the corresponding
curve, which was provided in Figure 6.4, is presented in Figure 6.5.

ANN_Tanh produced the best estimation of the stress signal as shown
by the lowest MSE value compared to ANN_Linear and ANN_SLin and

According to the MSE values for ANN_Linear and ANN_SLin, ANN_SLin
produced a better estimate of the stress signal compared to ANN_Linear with
0.01 < p < 0.01. Examples of the outputs from the three ANNs in relation to the
form of the curve of the corresponding functions are shown in Figure 6.6. The
curves produced by the ANNs show that the overall rate of change in stress is
negative, which is consistent with the results produced by the classification
systems, but there were certain times in the meditation experiment when the
curves had a positive rate of change as shown by slight increases in stress
values over the time periods. This observation could not be deduced by the
survey responses from the experiment. Future work could extend the ANN
stress signal predictor with desired output estimator functions that could form
167

Chapter 6: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Real Environments
curves with rates of change that has a positive rate of change for certain time
periods and survey responses could be captured at a higher level of granularity
to validate the slight increases in the stress signal.

6.7 Summary
Computational models of stress for observers of real-life environments were
developed using real-world stress data sets formed from the Interview and
Meditation experiments. The data sets were made up of physiological and
physical sensor signals, which were provided to individual-independent
observer stress recognition systems to capture stress patterns in the data for the
interview and meditation environments. The systems were based on a SVM and
a hybrid of a GA and SVM. Observer stress patterns were successfully captured
by the computational models for the different environments. In addition,
relative stress patterns were successfully captured by the models irrespective of
the environment. This work provides a method to recognise observer stress and
determine whether an environment is stressful or not stressful.
169

Chapter 6: Modelling Computational Observer Stress for Real Environments
Further, a computational method to model a stress signal of an observer
for meditation setting was successfully developed using stress response signals.
The architecture of the model is presented in Figure 6.7. The survey was
designed to capture experiment participant responses over the period of the
environment. In addition, the responses across the participants were
statistically positively correlated. These two aspects of the survey provided the
ground truth to estimate a stress signal. The stress sensor signals and survey
responses were provided to an individual-independent observer stress
classification system based on an SVM to determine the overall profile of the
stress signal. A hybrid model of a GA and an SVM was developed to determine
which type of stress feature was more relevant for stress detection. The
optimised features were used to estimate a stress signal using the proposed
stress signal predictor, which is based on an ANN. Results showed that the
stress signal for observers was best represented using a curve that resembled to
a hyperbolic tangent function rather than being similar to a linear function or a
symmetric saturating linear function.
In summary, the research contributions of this chapter are:


A real-world stress data set for observer stress for RE;



Stress analysis from a novel set of primary stress signals;



Computational models for observer stress for RE;



Computational model architectures that can be successfully used to
model observer stress for all AVE, VE and RE; and



A computational stress signal predictor system.

Chapter 7 Conclusions and Future Work
This chapter concludes the thesis by summarising the major outcomes from the
research and contributions to computational stress research against the research
questions identified in Chapter 1. It also proposes some future directions for
research arising from the thesis.

7.1 Conclusions
Computational models were developed for observer stress for abstract virtual
environments, virtual environments and real environments using real-world
data sets which were collected for each type of environment. The research
established a context through an analysis of relevant work and identified gaps
in the literature. The survey of the literature included discussions of human
response signals that show symptoms of stress used previously in research for
stress detection. The term primary stress signals was coined in this thesis and
was used to capture the interpretation of human response signals showing the
stress symptoms and these comprised physiological and/or physical signals
sourced by sensors. An analysis was presented of the computational methods
used by other researchers to detect stress using primary stress signals for
situations eliciting stress. The majority of the models developed for stress have
used supervised learning techniques with ground truth based on human
reported stress [24].
An objective definition of stress coined computed stress, based on
characteristics of primary stress signals derived from non-invasive methods,
was proposed to differentiate its meaning from the traditional stress term. The
traditional stress term encompasses the definition of stress from human reports
and human response measures derived from even invasive methods such as
173

Chapter 7: Conclusions and Future Work
extracting blood samples. The term computed observer stress was proposed to
refer to a more specific type of computed stress to mean computed stress for
observers of environments. The terms and their definitions were used to define
the proposed computational models of observer stress for abstract virtual
environments [194-197] virtual environments [207, 208] and real environments
[225, 226]. These models were successfully developed for individuals and
models that captured individual-independent observer stress patterns.
Experimental designs were presented for real-world observer stress data
collection from the different environments. Observer stress data sets were
developed from the data collected from the experiments and used to investigate
and model observer stress for the different environments.
In addition, this research investigated modelling stress with primary
stress signals sourced by non-obtrusive sensors to make data acquisition less
obstructive for observers so that they are more comfortable during the process.
From the statistical analysis, there was no significant difference between the
observer stress classification results produced by the models using primary
stress signals sourced by contact sensors and non-obtrusive sensors [207]. This
suggests that interfaces for stress data acquisition have the potential to be
embedded in a person’s environment for monitoring stress and reducing the
risk of impeding the person’s usual behaviour and activities. Due to this
reduction in obstruction to enhance the capturing of natural behaviours and
activities, accurate recordings of primary stress signals can be made and used
to produce stress models that recognise stress more robustly.
Furthermore, a stress signal predictor system was proposed combining
the results of the various earlier investigations undertaken. The computational
system shows that observer stress can be modelled on a continuous time
domain for a meditation environment [226]. The structure of the experiment
survey and the statistical correlation of the responses of the survey across the
experiment participants enabled the development of the stress signal predictor
system for the environment. The experiment surveys for the other

174

7.1 Conclusions
environments did not have the essential structure to determine stress levels for
particular stages of the environment and this resulted in insufficient
information to define the ground truth for the model systems. As a
consequence, this thesis did not investigate developing stress signal predictor
systems for those environments. However, this thesis showed that it is possible
to develop a stress signal predictor system for an environment and if future
work could involve better methods to determine ground truth for the other
environments, developing stress signal predictor systems for the environments
could be investigated. A stress signal predictor system can help a person
understand their levels of stress at particular times while they see events in an
environment. As a result, this can allow a person to pinpoint which events in
the environment greatly influence their stress levels and levels of influence of
other events.
The research presented in this thesis has helped to develop an objective
understanding of stress and how average individuals respond to events they
observe in environments they encounter. It provides research findings that
have the potential to help individuals manage their stress, which is a major
cause for health, social and economic concern in our society. Further, this
research contributes in developing better and more objective approaches in
dealing with stress.
In summary, the main contributions to research of this thesis include:
1. Objective definition for observer stress;
2. Computational models of observer stress for observer stress recognition
using real-world data sets with sensor signals;
3. Real-world observer stress data sets for abstract virtual environments,
virtual environments and real environments;
4. Computational techniques for sensor fusion for observer stress
recognition; and

175

Chapter 7: Conclusions and Future Work
5. Computational methods to predict observer stress including a
computational system to estimate a stress signal i.e. stress varying with
time.

7.2 Future Work
Further research directions have emerged from the work in this thesis, which
provides a rich base for further research in computational stress. The major
research questions for future work are summarised below. Implementations of
the research outcomes are also identified and could benefit stress detection and
management in real-world situations.

A Stress Signal Predictor System with Optimisation
The stress signal predictor system proposed in this thesis could be extended to
include optimisation of the derivative or rate of change of the transfer functions
of the ANN to further generalise the process for estimating a stress signal. The
experiment done to collect human assessed responses during the activities in
the environments over time was at a more abstract level of granularity so the
small increases in stress levels in the stress signals could be not validated.
Future work in this area would require stress to be assessed at a more detailed
level of granularity than the assessment method in this thesis.

A Stress Signal Predictor System for an Observer for Different Types of
Environments
An investigation can be done on the effect different types of environments have
on the stress signal of an observer. A stress signal for an observer for each type
of environment could be estimated by the stress signal predictor using the
architecture proposed in this thesis and the stress signals for the environments

176

7.2 Future Work
can be compared. The research will also require developing methods to define
ground truth for the system.

Continuous Stress Measure Varying with Time for an Individual Interacting
with a Stressor
Future work could include estimating a stress signal for an individual
interacting with particular stress stimuli as opposed to estimating a stress
signal of an observer who was not actively engaged in the environment, which
was the focus of this work.

Optimising Time Segments for Primary Stress Signals for Stress Detection
Certain primary stress signals may show stress symptoms earlier than others
due to different physiological response times. For efficiency and better quality
stress classification, a stress classification model system can be developed to
make use of the signals that best show stress at particular time segments of an
environment. A computational model that detects stress by optimising signals
for particular time segments to improve stress classification can be investigated.

Computational Models with Capturing Time-Varying Stress Patterns
A more sophisticated model could be developed that captures time-varying
stress patterns by exploiting the time-varying nature of features for stress
classification. When stress feature values across time periods were provided as
input to the time-delay ANN stress classification models for individual
observers in Section 4.4, the quality of the stress classifications were better than
the classification models that did not incorporate values for features across
multiple time segments. It also formed a more robust stress classification
model. Future work could investigate the performance of individual-

177

Chapter 7: Conclusions and Future Work
independent models that capture time-varying stress patterns for stress
classification.

Unsupervised Learning Models for Modelling Stress
This work developed supervised modelling techniques for stress. Future work
could include an investigation of whether stress can be modelled using
unsupervised learning techniques. For these types of techniques, it will be
important to use optimised primary stress signals and optimised stress features
for stress detection. Feature optimisation methods proposed in this work could
be used e.g. GA and PISA based approaches.

Relationship between Computational Observer Stress and Environments
Research can be done to determine the relationship between computational
observer stress and the observer’s comprehension of the events presented in the
environment at particular times. A research question in this area of research
could be “is there a relationship between stress and reading to acquire
knowledge and if so how do the events in the reading influence computed
stress?”

How Much Rest is Enough After Seeing a Stressful Environment?
It was pointed out in the literature that ‘enough’ rest [34] should be taken after
being exposed to a stimulus or demand that causes stress. However, ‘enough’ is
not well quantified. Future research could investigate a quantifiable definition
for ‘enough’ rest. Another perspective that research could consider is to
determine and plan daily activity routine schedules to minimise the effects of
stress quantifiably.

178

7.2 Future Work
How do Computational Stress Models Compare for Individuals from
Different Social Backgrounds?
The research in this thesis reduced the effect of individual bias in
computational stress models by using stress data normalized by individuals.
Investigations of the effects of individuals from different cultural and ethnic
backgrounds on the proposed stress models were beyond the scope of this
thesis. This research could be extended to develop stress models for individuals
from different social backgrounds.

Modelling Observer Stress for Multiple Concurrent Primary Environments
This thesis investigated primary environments. An example of a composite
environment for an observer is when an observer watches an argument
between two people and also listens to non-stressful music on their
headphones. Future work could develop a computational stress model to
investigate how events in a composite environment, defined by multiple
primary environments, influence observer stress.

Scheduling Environments for Observers to Minimise their Overall Stress
A computational system can be developed to determine how different
environments influence observer stress and how the order of the environments
affects an observer’s stress. The system can be extended to propose an order of
environments for an observer to minimise their overall stress.

A Mobile Stress Management System with Online Stress Analysis and
Human-Centred Stress Acquisition Interface
The literature has reported the risk for health and social problems for
individuals when stress is left unmanaged, as discussed in Chapter 1. The

179

Chapter 7: Conclusions and Future Work
research reported in this thesis provides a basis for such a system. Algorithms
proposed in this thesis need an interface with users including a mobile
interface. Future work could develop a computational stress management
system (CSMS) that uses a non-obtrusive stress data acquisition interface and
provides online stress analysis in a mobile setting. CSMS will require
developing a non-obtrusive stress monitoring system interface that sources
data from a person encountering environments from their daily activities to
model stress, evaluate stress levels, provide a future prediction of their stress
levels, and suggest activities they should adopt to decrease or maintain their
stress levels in different environments.
