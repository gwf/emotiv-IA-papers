Abstract: As the use of social network sites (SNS) has become increasingly prevalent, its effect
on sustainable performance has received much attention. The existing literature has taken either
a positive or negative view of SNS, arguing that it either decreases performance by taking time
and effort away from work, or increases performance by providing social benefits for enhancing
performance. In contrast, this experimental study, investigates how SNS use can disturb or enhance
the performance of different types of tasks differently, thus influencing the sustainability of task
performance. Based on distraction-conflict theory, this study distinguishes between simple and
complex tasks, examines the role of SNS, and analyzes data including electroencephalography data
captured by a brain-computer interface. The results show that task performance can be sustainable
such that SNS use positively influences performance when participants are engaged in a simple task
and influences performance neither positively nor negatively when participants are engaged in a
complex task. The study finds the former result is attributable to the positive effect of the psychological
arousal induced by SNS use and the latter result to the negative effect of the psychological arousal
offsetting the positive effect of reduced stress resulting from SNS use.

1. Introduction
The use of social network sites (SNS) has become a mundane activity for most people. Facebook
alone had more than 1.86 billion monthly active users in 2016, 1.23 billion use it daily, and almost 94%
of daily active users (1.15 billion) use it through mobile devices [1]. Given the prevalence of mobile
support, people use SNS without time and space limitations, and SNS use has become rather constant.
One of the controversial issues regarding this perpetual SNS use is the relationship between
SNS use and performance: is SNS use helpful or harmful to the sustainability of an individual’s
performance? Many people believe that SNS use diminishes performance. In terms of learning
performance, SNS use decreases it by reducing the time and energy available for learning [2], leading
some professors to ban all laptop use in the classroom to prevent SNS use during lectures [3].
Most organizations also consider SNS use a distraction that impairs employees’ task performance.
In a survey of 1400 Chief Information Officers of U.S. companies with 100 or more employees,
54% responded that their companies prohibit SNS use completely, 19% authorize it for business
purposes only, 16% permit it for limited personal use, and only 10% allow it for any type of personal
use [4]. As this result shows, the majority share the view that SNS use while working diverts employees’
attention away from their tasks, and thus should be limited to work-related purposes, if allowed at all.
However, completely banning SNS use during work or limiting SNS use to only work-related
purposes seems neither possible nor effective. The prevalence of mobile devices does not require

employees to have access to a company-controlled network to use SNS. Most people are already
chronically connected to SNS, spending 1 h and 49 min per day on average on SNS, constituting 28%
of their Internet use [5]. Moreover, in a survey of 1060 companies that have adopted corporate SNS
for business purposes, 60% responded that SNS had the positive effect of improving organizational
performance but only when its use was not limited to work-relevant matters and embraced all kinds
of social interaction [6].
Researchers who have focused on the social benefits rather than the harmful distractions of
SNS suggest that SNS use can increase overall performance. For example, studies have found that it
can encourage cooperation [7], interaction [8], knowledge generation and sharing [9], strengthened
relationships among members [10], enhanced psychological well-being [11], and increased emotional
capital of an organization [6] and thereby enhance performance.
As such research implies, the effect of SNS use on performance can be more complex than simply
negative or positive. While SNS use can be a distraction that takes attention and resources away
from the primary task, its social aspects can simultaneously facilitate a positive effect and result in
increased performance. Therefore, understanding the relationship between SNS use and sustainable
performance requires a more integrated and granulated view that can explain when and how SNS
use can diminish or enhance task performance. Most research, however, is not designed to investigate
the effect of SNS use on performance during the completion of a task, and is thus limited in aiding
understanding of how the effect of distraction and social aspects induced by SNS use simultaneously
operate on task performance.
This study, therefore, adopts distraction–conflict theory [12,13], which suggests a certain
distraction can work positively on simple task performance while the same distraction can operate
negatively on complex task performance. This theory can be useful and effective in explaining how
the SNS use during the completion of work tasks can operate both negatively and positively on
the sustainability of task performance. More specifically, the study tries to answer two questions:
(1) Does such SNS use increase or decrease task performance? (2) What is the underlying mechanism
of SNS use that either increases or decreases task performance? To answer these questions, this
study uses an experimental method and analyzes responses gathered by a self-reported scale and
electroencephalography (EEG) data gained from a Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) device.
2. Literature Review: Effect of SNS Use on Performance
Research has yielded conflicting findings about the relationship between SNS use and
performance. This is because most studies on SNS use have focused on just one or the other of
two critical aspects of people’s engagement leading to performance: (1) the time and effort they
invest in a task, and (2) social aspects of the task, such as their interaction with others in the task
environment [14]. Research that focuses on the first considers SNS use as a distraction and views the
time and energy spent on SNS use as reducing those that should be devoted on performing a given
task, thus suggesting that SNS use decreases task performance. In contrast, the research that focuses on
the second values the social aspects of SNS that can leverage task performance directly and indirectly,
thus arguing that SNS use improves performance.
2.1. The Negative Effect of SNS Use on Performance
Regarding SNS use and the sustainability of work performance in an organization, researchers
share the view that SNS use reduces the time that employees are supposed to devote to work,
thus decreasing productivity, which is significantly constrained by limited time resources at work
(e.g., [15,16]). For example, Herlle and Astray-Caneda [17], viewed SNS as a distraction from work
that reduces work input such as completing jobs in timely manner and staying focused on job
activities during work time, and, consequently work outcomes, such as recognition and advancement
opportunities. They argued that SNS should be managed and controlled through organizational means,

Sustainability 2017, 9, 2270

such as training programs that teach organizational policies about SNS use and their responsibility
regarding the compliance with those policies and emphasize job input and output balance.
Research about the relationship between SNS use and the sustainability of academic performance
shows similar findings. While some researchers found no relationship between Facebook use and
academic performance (e.g., [2,18,19]), others found a negative relationship between them. Junco [20]
and Kirschner and Karpinski [2] demonstrated that time spent on Facebook was strongly negatively
related to overall GPA, as time spent on Facebook was negatively related to time spent preparing
for class. Frein, et al. [21] showed that high-use Facebook users had significantly lower scores on
a free recall test than did low-use Facebook users. In an experiment by Wood et al. [22], participants
in a Facebook use condition performed more poorly than those in a paper-and-pencil use condition.
Gupta and Irwin [23] found that when students received Facebook interruptions, they showed lower
lecture comprehension.
2.2. The Positive Effect of SNS Use on Performance
On the other hand, many researchers have found the positive effect of SNS use on performance,
focusing on its social functions. Regarding work performance, many believe that SNS as a social
technology can leverage the value of an organizational social network by enabling employees to
collaborate, communicate better, transfer knowledge, and reach out to experts whom they have never
encountered in a physical space to seek information (e.g., [24,25]). While examining those views,
researchers have found rather various results and diverse reasons in explaining those because the
social benefits of SNS can also vary. For example, Charoensukmongkol [26] argued that SNS use can
enhance perceived social support and found that intense use of SNS increased employees’ perceived
level of job performance. In a study of 1799 employees in the insurance industry, Leftheriotis and
Giannakos [27] found that a high social media usage group perceived their own work performance as
higher than groups with low or medium social media usage. Similarly, some found a positive effect of
SNS on performance improvement, but the way it turned out was different from their expectations.
For examples, Cao et al. [28], expecting to find that SNS use would enhance software professionals’
performance through promoting knowledge transfer and stimulating trust, found that it contributed
to increasing work performance only by strengthening trust among employees. Moqbel et al. [29]
hypothesized that the intensity of SNS use could directly enhance job performance by improving
work-life balance, but found that SNS intensity affected job performance only through job satisfaction.
Diverse reasoning about the positive relationship between SNS use and performance is also
indicated regarding academic performance. The findings of Al-rahmi and Othman [30] showed that
students’ interaction with peers and teachers through SNS enhanced their academic performance
directly and through collaborative learning. Yu et al. [31] found that Facebook engagement not
only affected performance proficiency positively but also improved it through increasing social
acceptance and acculturation. Ainin et al. [32] reported that Facebook usage intensity affected academic
performance positively by mediating social acceptance.
2.3. The Effect of SNS as a Distraction and Social Technology on Performance
As a whole, research has clearly shown that SNS use is a distraction from task performance,
but SNS are also social technologies that can improve overall performance by providing social benefits
to their users. Therefore, this study asks, what if the distraction and social effects of SNS, which appear
to be contrasting effects, operate simultaneously? For example, what if a person uses SNS during
the completion of a task but is somehow positively affected by the social benefits of SNS? Will the
distraction effect still be dominant and decrease task performance? Or will the positive social effects
offset the distraction effect and increase overall task performance?
The existing literature, however, does not provide an answer to this question. This is mostly
because, first, most findings have not resulted from a research design examining task performance
when people are distracted by SNS during the completion of a task, and second, most have not

Sustainability 2017, 9, 2270

4 of 21

considered how SNS use affects performance differently depending on task type. Some research,
for example, has simply compared the performance of SNS users to that of non-SNS users (e.g., [21,27]).
Some has used a retrospective method, asking people to report their SNS usage experience and related
it to their final performance (e.g., [30,31]). Others have employed a self-reporting method, asking
SNS users to evaluate their own performance and comparing those reports to those of non-SNS users
(e.g., [26,27]). Only a few studies have used a task-performing scenario and conducted an experiment.
In one study, Gupta and Irwin [23] simulated using SNS and listening to a lecture as concurrent
tasks and studied how students allocated their attentional resources between them. They found that
the task and SNS use competed for the students’ attention and that their attentional resources were
allocated toward the source that provided the maximum reward: the participants selected SNS over
a low-interest lecture more often than over a high-interest lecture. The view on SNS in this study,
however, was limited to another source of multi-tasking distraction rather than a social technology
whose impact can be diverse and pervasive in this highly connected era. Similarly, Wood, Zivcakova,
Gentile, Archer, De Pasquale and Nosko [22] took the same view, comparing SNS messenger use to
other distractions such as emailing and texting.
Therefore, understanding the effect of SNS on performance during the completion of a task in
a more consolidated and reconciled manner as both a disturbance or social leverage will provide much
more useful insights about the relationship between SNS use and the sustainability of task performance.
3. Theoretical Background and Hypothesis: Distraction–Conflict Theory
It is generally recognized that distractions decrease creativity and performance in jobs that
require concentration and creative thinking [33,34]. Distraction is defined as something that directs
task performers’ attention away from some ongoing activity [12,13]. This divided attention results
in attentional conflict among inputs when the distraction is very interesting or hard to ignore and
performers cannot attend simultaneously to the required task and the distraction. It then leads to
capacity and structural interferences, in which the number of incoming cues interferes with the capacity
to handle the task and divided attention to multiple inputs interferes with cognitive processing [35].
Not all distraction, however, is necessarily negative. Social facilitation suggests that distractions
caused by the presence of others lead people to be in a heightened state of psychological arousal.
This state is called drive as it has the effect of an excitatory state and has power to drive one’s
behavior [36,37]. This drive operates to enhance dominant responses, the most quickly elicited
responses to the stimulus [36]. It suggests that when people are psychologically aroused, they tend to
do what they are usually likely to do more strongly. When people are doing a simple task, such as a
well-learned routine task, the dominant responses are mostly correct ones that are helpful to execute
tasks; thus linked to better performance. However, when people are doing a complex task such as one
that is not well-defined, the dominant responses are usually incorrect; thus the execution of dominant
responses may lead to deterioration of performance [36].
The current study argues that this type of social facilitation can be provided by SNS use.
As Markus [38] showed, the mere presence of others can elevate drive by provoking attentional conflict
and can generate social facilitation just as with the specific presence of others. The mere presence of
others means that the performer is aware that other people are there, but these other people do not
evaluate the performers, give cues, deliver reinforcement, or lend help. Nevertheless, simply being
aware of others’ presence can distract performers and enhance or impair their performance. SNS can
provide a similar presence environment. It creates a feeling of social presence [39,40], which is defined
as the extent to which a medium is perceived as sociable, warm, sensitive, personal, or intimate [41],
thus increasing psychological arousal. Even though the presence of others in SNS is virtual rather
than physical and does not take place in real time, online presence can lead to a feeling of crowding,
which suggests insufficient personal space or excessive social contact within one’s surrounding [42].
Furthermore, recent studies have extended the sources of social presence from physical human beings
to virtual ones induced by technology (e.g., [43–45]). Thus, the following hypothesis is suggested:

Sustainability 2017, 9, 2270

5 of 21

Hypothesis 1. The psychological arousal in a group with SNS use will be higher than in a group with no
SNS use.
Distraction–conflict theory also posits that stress arises during performing a task and operates
differently depending on the type of task. Stress is felt when there is a “substantial imbalance
between environmental demand and the response capability of the focal organism” [46] (p. 17).
When performing a simple task, stress narrows the performer’s attention on a task and creates the
possible exclusion of irrelevant information [37]. Thus, decreasing the stress level is not an appropriate
tactic for increasing performance for a simple task. It is stress induced in a high-demand and high-threat
situation that disrupts performance [47]. When people are exposed to a task that is challenging and
threatening, stress rises as the anticipation of failure also arises and they try to adjust to the stress
physiologically, psychologically, and behaviorally [48]. In this process, task performance is generally
diminished since dealing with stress takes resources that can be psychological or physiological and
should be allocated to performing tasks [49]. Thus, people fail to sustain their performance level [50].
People who confront a high task load tend to experience more stress and to perform less well than
those assigned a low task load [51–53]. Therefore, there has been much effort to decrease task stress
when performing complex tasks.
In particular, attention-related research argues that stress increases and task performance
deteriorates when people experience directed attention fatigue after performing a task for an extended
period [54]. Therefore, research suggests that attention should be moved from a task even for a short
period time, and even this short break can help restore attention and reduce stress, thus repairing the
impaired performance level. A break means a period of time in which work-relevant tasks are not
required or expected [55], and taking it decreases work fatigue and maintains performance level [56].
Trougakos, Beal, Green and Weiss [55] have also shown that respite activities such as socializing
during work breaks are effective in increasing positive emotions and decreasing negative emotions.
Furthermore, this effect of socializing can operate regardless of whether it provides work-relevant
social support that can be helpful in performing a task. When stressful events occur, Cohen and
Wills [57] suggest, not only the specific social support given to a person regarding the event but also
the existence of social integration—the feeling of being embedded in a larger social network—can have
a positive effect on reducing stress and a person’s well-being. Therefore, as SNS use fundamentally
involves social aspects regardless of active or passive social activities, its use can become a break and,
at the same time, an effective means of gaining social integration. In other words, by moving attention
away from a task and making people feel others’ presence, SNS use can be effective in decreasing
stress. Since the effect of decreasing stress improves performance only for complex tasks, the following
hypothesis is posited:
Hypothesis 2. For those performing complex tasks, the stress level will be lower in a group with SNS use than
in a group with no SNS use.
For the performance of simple tasks, given that increased psychological arousal induced by SNS
use can increase task performance. Distraction–conflict theory can elaborate how this works [12,13].
People perform better when the beneficial effect of elevated drive generated by distraction outweighs
the disruptive effects of distraction. In the case of performing a simple task, the intensity of distraction
can actually have a positive effect on task performance [37]. The following hypothesis, therefore,
is proposed:
Hypothesis 3. The performance of a simple task will be higher in a group with SNS use than in a group with
no SNS use.
In the case of complex tasks, however, predicting performance following SNS use is complicated.
The effect of psychological arousal increased by SNS use can deteriorate performance of complex

Sustainability 2017, 9, 2270

6 of 21

tasks, but the effect of reduced stress can promote it. Therefore, this study hypothesizes that those two
effects will offset each other, and that SNS use thus will neither increase nor decrease complex task
performance overall. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:
Hypothesis 4. The performance of a complex task by an SNS use group will be indifferent from that of a no
SNS use group.
4. Method
An experiment was conducted. Particularly to capture stress of participants, the electroencephalography
(EEG)-based BCI method was used. BCI is a non-invasive technique for recording brain signals using
electrodes placed on the scalp to capture electrical activity primarily in the cerebral cortex [58]. The BCI
device offers demonstrated usability, reliability, cost effectiveness, and portability. It also involves
minimal risk for participants due to its non-invasive way of monitoring their brain signals. Thus,
the relative convenience of conducting studies and recruiting participants has increased the adoption
of the BCI method in various areas recently (e.g., [59,60]). The particular BCI used for this study is
Emotiv EPOC+ wireless headset (Emotiv (https://www.emotiv.com/), San Francisco, CA, USA).
4.1. Experiment Design and Procedure
To ensure that the difference between the SNS use and no SNS use groups was not due to the
mere effect of not doing a task, the non-SNS users were divided into two groups, one which took a
time of not doing a task (break) but did not use SNS and one which neither used SNS nor had a break.
Therefore, a 2 (task complexity: simple task vs. complex task) × 3 (the existence of distraction: SNS use
vs. no SNS use (break and no break)) design was employed. Participants were randomly distributed
among the resulting six conditions:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)

Simple task, SNS use
Simple task, no SNS use (break)
Simple task, no SNS use (no break)
Complex task, SNS use
Complex task, no SNS use (break)
Complex task, no SNS use (no break)

In this experimental setting, it was essential to ensure that participants did not have any
distractions other than that intended for the study. Therefore, the experiment was conducted in
a room in which each participant worked alone. As even the mere presence of an experimenter can be a
distraction, all experiment materials, including instructions, task forms, and questionnaires, were given
as computer versions. The detailed procedure was as follows. Each participant entered a waiting room
and was asked to read the provided task instructions. When the participant was ready, he or she was
escorted into an adjoining room and was seated in front of a computer. An experimenter then placed a
BCI headset on the participant. After the experimenter confirmed that the headset was worn properly
and then left the room, the participant clicked an online task, starting the experiment. When a message
announcing the end of the experiment was displayed on the computer screen, the participant was
asked to call out to the experimenter. The headset was then removed by the experimenter, and the
participant returned to the waiting room and left.
4.2. Task Complexity and Distraction Manipulation
Earley’s [61] scheduling task was adopted for the simple and complex tasks, as it is known to be
useful in controlling task complexity with the same materials and requires problem-solving efforts.
In doing this task, participants were asked to produce five unique schedules, each consisting of five
non-redundant classes. Upon starting the task, an online page was displayed with five empty class

Sustainability 2017, 9, 2270

7 of 21

slots for making a single schedule. By clicking each slot, a participant could see a list of 12 classes,
each having at least 10 different sections. Each class section had information consisting of (a) course
name; (b) day; and (c) time. For example, “Business Writing [Mon, Wed, Fri] 8:00–8:50 a.m.” meant
that a business writing course was offered at 8:00–8:50 a.m. on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and a
participant could choose the class for any one of those days; “Business Writing [Mon] 9:00–10:30 a.m.”
meant that the course was available at 9:00–10:30 a.m. only on Monday. When one schedule was
complete, the participant clicked the “next” button to move to the next schedule.
During this task, participants in both conditions were asked to follow three scheduling rules:
(a) each schedule must have five different classes scheduled on the same day; (b) class times
within a single schedule must not conflict; and (c) each schedule cannot duplicate another schedule.
For participants in the complex task condition, three additional rules were imposed: (a) no two
marketing courses (i.e., marketing research, marketing strategy, and consumer behavior) can be
scheduled within one hour of each other; (b) if a communication class is selected, the communication
practice class should also be included in the schedule and vice versa; and (c) if a course with an
introduction class is selected, the same course with a discussion class must also be in the schedule and
vice versa.
After finishing the first three schedules, participants in the SNS use group were interrupted and
asked to use their Facebook account for about three minutes. The three-minute time span for the
duration of SNS use was selected for three reasons. First, the average human attention span for a freely
chosen task can range from 5 to 20 min [62]. Second, the experimental design required assigning an
equal amount of minutes to the SNS use and no-SNS use and break groups and the experiment had to
avoid having the participants in the latter groups becoming overly bored while instructed to refrain
from doing anything for that period of time. Third, the aim of this study was to demonstrate that even
a short use of SNS can affect task performance. As a result, the duration of SNS use was conservatively
chosen as three minutes, which is slightly shorter than the minimum attention span.
Participants in the no-SNS use group who were assigned a break were instead asked to look at
the green square displayed on the page and do nothing for about three minutes. The green square was
shown for two reasons. First, the ultimate goal of the break was to release attention and looking at
green can help to achieve this purpose [63]. Second, by providing clear and specific guidance for this
period, participants were prevented from engaging in other attention-requiring activities. After three
minutes, they were asked to continue the scheduling and finish the tasks.
Participants in the no-SNS use group without the break condition were not interrupted and
instructed to make five course schedules consecutively. All of these instructions were displayed on the
computer screen as the experiment progressed.
4.3. Measurements
Three different types of measurement were used—namely, an objective measure, a self-report
measure, and an EEG interpretation measure. First, as an objective measure, the clock counter on the
computer calculated the time taken for a task. Second, a self-report measure was used to capture the
participants’ psychological arousal. Third, stress was captured through an EEG interpretation measure
provided by Emotiv EPOC+ software. The usefulness of capturing emotions and psychological state
through the EPOC+ is widely accepted in the literature (e.g., [64,65]).
4.3.1. Task Performance
Task performance can be measured in two ways: by how accurate the result was and by how long
it took. First, for accuracy, each rule violation in scheduling received a penalty score. The analysis
of variance (ANOVA) result on this penalty score indicated no differences in accuracy across the six
conditions—F = 0.791 (p = 0.557) for schedule 1, F = 0.972 (p = 0.436) for schedule 2, F = 0.706 (p = 0.620)
for schedule 3, F = 1.562 (p = 0.172) for schedule 4, and F = 0.784 (p = 0.562) for schedule 5—suggesting
that scheduling mistakes randomly occurred among participants. Therefore, participants’ task

Sustainability 2017, 9, 2270

8 of 21

performance score was measured by the time (seconds) it took to finish the task. As the time taken
for the first scheduling task may include the participants’ learning time of becoming accustomed to
the online scheduling setting, the time of the first scheduling was likely to be overestimated thus
disregarded. Then, the summation of the time taken for the second and third scheduling was used as
the performance score before the treatment (pre-performance), and that of the fourth and fifth scheduling
was used as the performance score after the treatment (post-performance).
4.3.2. Psychological Arousal
The measure of psychological arousal was adopted from studies by Bradley and Lang [66] and
Mehrabian and Russell [67]. It consists of a set of 12 bipolar adjective pairs (relaxed-stimulated,
calm-excited, sluggish-frenzied, dull-jittery, sleepy-wide awake, and unaroused-aroused) that are each
rated along a seven-point scale. Participants were asked to choose the rating that best described their
current status on each pair.
These questions were asked twice, first before the scheduling task to capture their initial
psychological arousal status (initial-arousal), then right after SNS use for SNS use groups and right after
break for no SNS use-break groups (treatment-arousal). Given that the no SNS use-no break groups
did not get a break, treatment-arousal was captured only for the SNS use and no SNS use-break
conditions. Then the average of the participants’ answers to the questions was used as the measure of
psychological arousal.
4.3.3. Stress
Stress level was monitored by BCI throughout the experiment. The average of the participants’
stress scores for the second and third scheduling was used for pre-stress, and that of their scores for the
fourth and fifth scheduling was used for post-stress for the analysis.
5. Results
5.1. Participants
For the experiment, 252 participants were recruited from a Korean university campus. Participants
were restricted to students who use Facebook and were promised 10,000 Korean won (roughly $9) for
their participation. For the analysis, the data of 18 participants whose EEG data were not generated
due to an unstable BCI connection or who reported no Facebook friends, suggesting their experience
could be significantly different from that of other participants, were eliminated. As a result, the data of
234 participants, 114 males and 120 females, aged from 18 to 34 (M = 22.021, SD = 2.189), were used for
the analysis. Demographic information regarding the participants is reported in Table 1.

that they did when they were interrupted and asked to use Facebook. Regarding the number of
activities, 47 participants answered they did one activity, 22 answered two, nine answered three,
two answered four, and one answered all the activities. Table 2 shows the number of participants who
answered they did the corresponding activity.

To ensure that the complexity of the task was manipulated correctly, participants were asked to
respond to the difficulty of the task using three questions taken from Earley [61]: “I found this to be
a complex task”, “This task was mentally demanding”, and “this task required a lot of thought and
problem solving”. A seven-point Likert scale with responses that ranged from “strongly disagree” to
“strongly agree” was used for those three questions and the responses were averaged. To eliminate the
possible effect of break-taking and SNS use on felt task complexity, participants in those two conditions
were asked these questions before the treatment. Participants in the no break condition were asked to
answer the questions at the end of the task, as they did not receive the treatment.
A t-test for the different task groups and two ANOVAs across the same task groups were
conducted (see Table 3 for descriptive statistics). A t-test result confirmed the difference in task

complexity between the simple task and complex task (t = 3.972 (p = 0.000)). Within the same task
type, no differences were found among groups for either the simple task (F = 0.129 (p = 0.971)) or the
complex task (F = 0.203 (p = 0.817)), thus suggesting that the complexity of the task was manipulated
as intended.

5.3. Hypotheses Testing
Table 4 shows the descriptive statistics of the scores for each task. Before testing the hypotheses,
ANOVA for pre-scores across groups for each type of task was conducted to ensure that the difference
in post-scores across groups was due not to the idiosyncratic characteristics of each group but to
the treatment effect. If this holds true, the pre-scores should not differ across groups. None of the
differences of the pre-scores across groups were statistically significant for the simple task—F = 1.972
(p = 0.144) for initial-arousal, F = 0.398 (p = 0.672) for pre-stress, and F = 0.372 (p = 0.690) for
pre-performance—and for the complex task—F = 0.85 (p = 0.919) for initial-arousal, F = 2.678 (p = 0.073)
for pre-stress, and F = 0.036 (p = 0.965) for pre-performance. This demonstrates no statistically
significant differences in the initial statuses of participants.

Performance

Comparison of post-score to
that of SNS use

The hypotheses comparing post-scores across groups were tested using one-way analyses of
covariance (ANCOVA). According to distraction-conflict theory, psychological arousal is the critical
factor that affects performance. As participants can be aroused by the interaction with the administrator
at the beginning of the experiment and by the artificial nature of experiment setting, their initial
psychological arousal scores were used as the covariate in ANCOVA. The test results are presented in
Table 5 and illustrated in Figure 1.
As the no SNS use and no-break group did not have their psychological arousal measured between
pre-treatment scheduling and post-treatment scheduling, only the comparison between the SNS use
group and break group was made. As expected, the SNS use group shows higher psychological arousal
scores than the simple break group for both types of task, supporting Hypothesis 1. The result is
illustrated in Figure 1.

For the simple task, it is interesting to note that the time taken for the first half of the post-treatment
scheduling (4th schedule) increased for participants in the no SNS use conditions, while it decreased
for those in the SNS use condition. The ANCOVA result shows that this difference is statistically
significant—F = 4.054 (p = 0.048) for between SNS use and break conditions and F = 4.688 (p = 0.034) for
between SNS use and no break conditions. The time differences in the latter half of the post-treatment
scheduling (5th schedule) across groups was not statistically significant, suggesting that the differences
in post-treatment performance across groups can be attributed to the improved performance right
after SNS use.
The same tests were conducted for the complex task. Although the data in Figure 1 seem to
suggest that the performance of participants in the SNS use group slightly improved after SNS use
while the performance of those no SNS use conditions was marginally impaired, the ANCOVA results
did not show statistically significant differences across groups.
6. Discussion
The results of hypotheses testing and additional analysis suggest several interesting insights.
First, although the psychological arousal scores of participants in the SNS use groups was significantly
higher than that of those in the simple break groups, note that the initial psychological scores of both
groups were higher than those following SNS use or break. A possible conjecture for this is that
participants were initially aroused due to the fact that they were being subjects of an experiment in
which an administrator installed a BCI headset on their heads that most of them have never worn or
seen in their lives. This initial arousal seems to have been alleviated as the experiment proceeded. This
does not mean, however, that the difference in treatment psychological arousal between the SNS use
groups and simple break groups is the consequence of initial arousal. The result clearly suggests that
SNS use made participants more psychologically aroused than did a simple break.
Although not supported, the test result for Hypothesis 2 suggests two things. First, a something
that can operate as a short break, which is getting attention away from a task, in the middle of
a task can be effective for decreasing stress. Second, for a complex task, this can be in any form:
a simple break or SNS use. For a simple task, however, only the simple break not SNS use decreases
stress level. A plausible explanation for this lies in how high the task performer’s need to release
attentional resource from a task is. When performing a complex task, in which the burden of the
task is substantial, the effect of releasing attentional resource from a task for moments whether by
SNS use or simple break may be dominant in decreasing stress. When performing the simple task,
however, the burden of the task is moderate, and thus there may not be a high need for the task
performer to release attentional resource. Therefore, the effect of releasing attentional resource from
the task is not dominant enough to prevent stress rising from attentional resource allocated to SNS.
This is consistent with the limited resource model of behavior regulation [68,69]. This model suggests
that people need self-control to perform tasks, and that this self-control uses mental and physical
resources such as attention and concentration. The tasks that are continued without breaks or need
more effort require high levels of self-control and thus cause performers’ stress [70]. When these
resources are consumed, self-control is no longer possible. To do tasks continuously, therefore, people
need to replenish resources. For this replenishment to be successful, recourse consumption level
should be lower than resource replenishment level and a break makes this possible by alleviating the
consumption of resources required for self-control [69]. The findings of this study imply that complex
task performers need to replenish resources more, and taking time off from a task, regardless of its
forms—simple break or SNS use—use fewer resources than doing tasks, thus also reducing stress
level as well. The fact that only simple break reduced stress level when performing simple task can
be explained similarly: a simple task does not require high levels of self-control, thus the level of
resource consumption for doing simple tasks may not be much higher than the level required for
using SNS. In other words, a similar amount of resources for task execution are consumed for SNS use,
thus resource replenishment does not occur and meaningful stress reduction does not occur either.

For the simple task, the performance of participants in the SNS use group was better than
those not subjected to SNS use. It is interesting to note that the only group of people whose
post-performance was not significantly improved was the simple break group, even though it is
also the only group whose post-stress level was significantly decreased. This finding confirms the
theory that stress is not related to simple task performance but only to complex task performance.
As distraction-conflict theory also suggests that high psychological arousal can have a positive effect
on simple task performance, the significantly lower psychological arousal felt by people in the break
group than that by people in the SNS use group can explain the relatively low performance of the
simple break group. When performance is considered as time taken for each scheduling, the overall
pattern of all three groups in Figure 1 shows a downward slope as the task proceeds, except for
the fourth scheduling. While the performance of participants in the SNS use group maintains the
descending path, those in the no SNS use groups take a longer time to perform the fourth scheduling
than the previous one. For the break group, this pattern might be explained by the low psychological
arousal they received from the break. For the no break group, it may be a result of the fatigue they feel
from the consecutive scheduling. This performance impairment occurs only at the beginning of the
post-treatment scheduling, as performance starts to improve again after that. Although this fluctuation
occurs only briefly, the finding indicates that only the SNS use prevented this performance fluctuation,
enabling performance to be sustainable.
For the performance of the complex task, the post-performance scores of all three groups are
not significantly different, as hypothesized. For participants in the SNS use group, this lack of
difference might be attributed to the positive effect of decreased stress being offset by the negative
effect of high psychological arousal, as the theory suggests. For the break group, however, their stress
levels decreased to as low a level as that of SNS use group and their psychological arousal level
was significantly lower than that of the SNS use group. This seems to be contradictory to what the
theory argues because distraction-conflict theory holds that they should thus have significantly better
performance given that both these effects positively affect performance. However, given that how high
psychological arousal must be to impair performance is unknown, the measured psychological level
for the break group can still be problematic for performing complex tasks.
7. Implications
7.1. Theoretical Implications
This study attempts to provide new understanding of how SNS use affects task performance by
examining its positive and negative effects simultaneously. The analysis of these results overall suggests
that use of SNS functions better than a mere break in improving performance when participants
are engaged in a simple task and no differently from a mere break when doing a complex task.
This suggests that, although SNS use is commonly viewed as a distraction, it can have a better or at
least the same effect as a simple work break, which is known to be a performance enhancer, therefore
contribute to making performance to be sustainable.
The findings of this study suggest, first, that SNS can play different roles for different people or
task environments. For some people performing a task that does not demand full concentration,
SNS can serve as a conduit to deliver a sense of others’ presence that is linked to increased
performance. For some people who are engaged in a task that requires full concentration, SNS can be
an attention-relieving break that is even socially enhanced. In this sense, this study contributes to the
literature by challenging the prevalent belief that SNS use is a mere distraction and by adding new
knowledge about when and how SNS use affects task performance.
Second, much of the literature concludes that SNS use has either positive or negative effects
upon performance without explaining the mechanisms by which SNS use influences performance.
This is partly because their methods are not designed to capture the effect of SNS use during a task,
instead using retrospective means or simple comparisons of SNS users and non-SNS users. To help fill

Sustainability 2017, 9, 2270

16 of 21

this knowledge gap, this study conducted a theoretically informed experiment and examined how
psychological arousal and stress induced and mitigated by SNS use can play a role during a task.
Third, by using physiological measures to validate empirical research, this study enhances the
methods used to reconcile physiological and psychological investigations. This is particularly useful
when a gap exists between people’s perceptions and behaviors. For example, Computers as Social
Actors theory [71] suggests that people do not perceive computers as social actors, but rather that
they react to them as they would to people in social settings. If an EEG shows that people’s brain
signals during SNS use display the same pattern as that during their face-to-face interactions with
physical human beings, we can understand a great deal more about the relationship between people
and technology than what psychometrics alone can reveal.
Fourth, the study challenges the assumptions of the current literature that view time and energy
in work settings solely as fixed resources and thus personal SNS use as inevitably a distraction that
reduces those resources. However, the findings of this study suggest that SNS can reduce stress that
is related to task complexity. As occupational stress can have negative effects on the physical and
mental health of people within the workplace [72], the personal use of SNS in learning and working
environments, although admittedly consuming some time and energy, may ultimately serve not as
a disruptive but as a productive distraction. The finding hints that seemingly wasted resources can
preserve valuable resources somewhere else suggesting that the time and energy as the fixed resources
in work setting should not be taken for granted.
Fifth, the findings of this study enrich the concept of social presence in distraction-conflict
theory. While previous studies have limited such presence to physical presence, this study shows
that the concept can be extended to online presence engendered by SNS. When combined with the
Computers as Social Actors theory [71], which suggests that people react to technology as they would
to other people, the findings of this study will further advance our understanding of how digital
materiality, by creating a perceptual social world, impacts our social behavior and, as a result, adjusts
our ontological world.
Finally, the findings of this study shed some light on enabling performance sustainability.
An individual’s sustainable performance is about not only enhancing their performance, but also
avoiding a drop in performance by preventing burnout [50]. A break has been known to have positive
effects on preventing cognitive fatigue and thus burnout [56]. This study suggests a new role of SNS:
SNS use, which is usually seen as a distractor of performance, can in some situations provide a break
that leads to sustainable performance.
7.2. Practical Implications
First, for managers of organizations, the findings of this study also suggest that personal SNS use
among employees does not have to be entirely avoided. Rather, in some situations, its brief usage in the
middle of work tasks should be even encouraged. Even though many organizations now acknowledge
the need for short work breaks, these results suggest that, in some situations, SNS use can have a better
effect than mere breaks. Entirely banning SNS use in an organization may be simple and easy to
execute, but doing so may result in losing valuable chances for achieving not only the sustainability of
individual performance but also the sustainability of organizational performance through enabling
social interactions [73] and helping to find entrepreneur opportunities [74].
Second, managers should consider not only task types but also workplace environments.
For example, when many people are working together in an open space, the psychological arousal
generated from having people physically nearby may be enough to keep a person motivated and
socially connected without engaging in SNS. On the other hand, employees who are working in
isolated environments might find SNS use energizing.
Third, the field study of SNS use in organizational contexts [6] suggests that successful SNS
use in an organization should not be restricted to work-related matters. This study provides a slight
hint of the reason behind this finding. SNS use should not be directed to the way to increase stress,

Sustainability 2017, 9, 2270

17 of 21

particularly when performing complex tasks. Restricting SNS use to work related matters not only
decrease organizational SNS use itself but may also associate stress to organizational SNS; this study
offers additional evidence that organizational SNS use should not be restricted to work-related matters.
Lastly, it is worth noting that the effect of SNS use is realized immediately, and thus workers can
begin the task they engage after SNS use in an improved condition. For example, the increased
psychological arousal produced by SNS use seems to prevent fatigue and enable fresh mental
processing capability for simple task performers. The improved task performance by SNS use can
be linked to the even better performance of the following task. Therefore, given that SNS effects can
be propagated to later task performance, the positive effects of SNS use at the right moment can be
magnified through time.
In conclusion, we are living in an era where our mundane activities are filled with technologies
that distract our attention. If we cannot turn these off, then we should seek out their positive
qualities—perhaps positive side effects of distractors—and think of using them wisely and helpfully
for our life to be sustainable as it should be. Disruptive distraction can also be productive distraction,
and momentary resource consumption can also be resource replenishment in the long run.
8. Limitations and Directions for Future Research
There are several limitations to this study. First, due to the inherent nature of experiment that
needs to separate variables of interest from other factors and the requirement of this study to eliminate
the presence of an administrator, it was possible to examine the relative differences in target variables
among the experimental groups but not their complicated causal relationships and specific threshold
that converts positive relationship to negative relationship or vice versa. In addition, to prevent
non-treatment factors from affecting experiment results, treatments have to be given at the same
moment for the same period of time across experimental conditions, without which it is not possible
to conclude that the results are due to the treatment effects. For this reason, timing and duration of
treatments in this experiment (SNS use and break) were fixed across conditions: at the end of the third
scheduling for three minutes. If not controlled this way, there could be many alternative explanations
for the result: the time taken for SNS use or break, frequency of using SNS or taking breaks, and task
progress level when a performer used SNS or took a break. Although this is necessary to control an
experiment and a task can be divided into as many subunits as possible, using SNS between subunits
of a task is not entirely natural. Future studies may adopt the method to monitor people’s SNS-related
behavior in a more natural environment in a longitudinal way. Doing so may reveal a myriad of paths
in which SNS use is connected to performance.
The current study revealed that the performance of a complex task by an SNS use group is
indifferent from that of a no SNS use group. The theory and results suggest that this is because
the positive effect of stress reduction offset the negative effect of psychological arousal. However,
other factors may intervene in the interaction between stress and psychological arousal. Future
research should focus on finding those variables and investigating the mechanism of how stress and
psychological arousal affect each other when performing certain types of tasks.
This study used a single form of task, a scheduling task. Although the chosen task involved
many types of task characteristics, such as decision making, solution finding, and varying degree of
complexity, future studies may extend this study by using multiple different tasks that are different
in nature and the time required to finish. Similarly, varying SNS usage time, purposes, and activities
as experiment treatments in future study can help establish a more robust understanding of SNS use
and performance.
This study delves into the relationship between SNS use and performance under the assumptions
of distraction-conflict theory. Future research may adopt different theories as main theories such as
the limited resource model of behavior regulation [68,69]. Future research may also investigate other
causes of positive and negative effects of SNS use on performance such as a feeling of social integration
and a compulsive need for using SNS than psychological arousal and stress. BCI devices such as that

Sustainability 2017, 9, 2270

18 of 21

used in this study can provide a good mean to measure various emotional and physiological factors
that can explain how SNS use affects performance.
9. Conclusions
The effect of SNS use on performance has been a controversial topic. As SNS use becomes a
mundane activity for increasing numbers of people, focusing on when and where it can have a positive
or negative effect on performance rather than simply categorizing that impact as positive or negative
can help move us far beyond our current understanding of its influence. The findings of this study
suggest that, contrary to the common view, short bouts of SNS use can enhance performance in a
simple task environment and make no difference in performance in a complex task environment.
This study demonstrates that high performance by SNS users on simple tasks may be associated with
high psychological arousal. It also suggests that although increased psychological arousal produced by
SNS use can impair performance in the case of complex tasks, the lowered stress it produced can offset
this effect and maintain the performance level. The findings can be used to reconsider organization
policies that are unfriendly toward SNS use, suggesting that when used selectively, SNS use can
contribute to increasing the organizational level of productivity.
