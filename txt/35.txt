Forward Invariance in Robotics: From Collaborative Swarm Behaviors to Safe Learning

Forward Invariance in Robotics: From Collaborative Swarm Behaviors to Safe
Learning
Prof. Magnus Egerstedt, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute
of Technology, U.S.A.

Abstract
Forward invariance refers to the property that if a system, like a robot, starts in a set, it stays in that set. Control
barrier functions can be used to ensure forward invariance by restricting the control actions to those satisfying
certain easily computable constraints. In this talk, we show how a number of problems in robotics can be cast in this
way, and we consider teams of robots, deployed in an environment over a sustained period of time, that can be
recruited to perform a number of different collaborative tasks in a distributed, safe, and provably correct manner.
This development will involve the composition of multiple barrier functions for encoding tasks and safety
constraints in a unified manner. Additionally, we show how one can achieve safe learning using barrier functions as
a way of ensuring that the exploratory part of the learning process never strays outside of what is currently known to
be safe configurations. As the system learns more about itself and the environment, these safe configurations expand
and, as a result, the learning process becomes increasingly less conservative. This process is illustrated by aerial
quad copters learning to fly in unknown and challenging wind conditions.

Attitude Synchronization and Formation Flying of Multiple Uncertain Spacecraft
Systems over Switching Networks
Prof. Jie Huang, Choh-Ming Li Professor of Mechanical and Automation Engineering,
Chinese University of Hong Kong, China

Abstract
More and more space missions involve the formation flying of multiple spacecraft systems. A few examples of such
missions include multiple spacecraft interferometer for infrared synthetic aperture imaging, large-scale distributed
sensors for probing the origin and structure of stars and galaxies, and replacement of multiple-payload platform. The
formation flying of multiple spacecraft systems entails the synchronized attitude control to provide the spacecraft
systems the capabilities of coordinated acquisition, tracking, and pointing. The existing results on attitude
synchronization and formation flying of multiple spacecraft systems are obtained under two key assumptions. First,
the communication network among the spacecraft systems is static and connected. Second, the model of the
spacecraft systems is known exactly. Never the less, neither of these two assumptions is realistic. In this talk, we
will report our recent research progress on the attitude synchronization and formation flying for multiple spacecraft
systems by relaxing the first assumption and removing the second assumption. To relax the first assumption, we
need to establish a distributed observer over a jointly connected switching network, which can be disconnected at
every time instant. To remove the second assumption, we incorporate the adaptive control technique into our design
framework to enable our approach to handle the uncertainty parameters in the multiple spacecraft systems. Finally,
we synthesize an adaptive distributed control law composed of the distributed observer and a purely decentralized
adaptive control law.

Learning-based Control
Prof. Zhong-Ping Jiang, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tandon School of
Engineering, New York University, U.S.A.

Abstract
This talk considers learning-based control design for continuous-time dynamical systems with unknown dynamics.
It introduces a new design paradigm, called "Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming (RADP)", that is
fundamentally different from traditional control theory. In the classical paradigm, controllers are often designed for
a given class of dynamical control systems; it is a model-based design. In the RADP paradigm, controllers are
learned online using real-time input-output data collected along the trajectories of the control system in question. An
entanglement of techniques from reinforcement learning and model-based control theory is advocated to find a
sequence of sub optimal controllers that will approximate the optimal solution as learning steps increase. On the one
hand, this RADP paradigm overcomes the well-known "curse of dimensionality" and the "curse of modeling"
associated with Bell-man's Dynamic Programming. On the other hand, rigorous stability and robustness analysis can
be derived for the closed-loop system with real-time learning-based controllers. The effectiveness of RADP as a new
framework for data-driven nonlinear control design is demonstrated via its applications to power systems,
autonomous vehicles, and biological motor control.

Optimized Assistive Human-Robot Interaction Using Reinforcement Learning

Date / Time

Speaker

Optimized Assistive Human-Robot Interaction Using Reinforcement Learning
Prof. Frank L. Lewis, Department of Electrical Engineering, The University of Texas at
Arlington, U.S.A.

Abstract
Co-robotics involves humans and robots working together safely in the same shared space as a team. This motivates
physical Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) systems that adapt to different humans and have guaranteed robustness
and stability properties. For modern interactive HRI systems to be capable of performing a wide range of tasks
successfully, it is required to include the effects of both the robot dynamics and the human operator dynamics. In
this talk we propose three adaptive HRI control systems that assist the human operator to perform a given task with
minimum human workload demands and improved overall human-robot system performance.
Human performance neuro psychological and human factors studies have shown that in coordinated motion with a
robot, human learning has two components. The operator learns a robot-specific inverse dynamics model to
compensate for the nonlinearities of the robot, and simultaneously learns a feed back control component that is
specific to the successful performance of the task. These foundations can be incorporated in the design of HRI
control systems that include the effects of both the robot dynamics and the human dynamics by using a 2-loop
design procedure.
In this talk, we develop an adaptive HRI control structure consisting of two control loops. First, a robot-specific
neuro-adaptive controller is designed in the inner loop to make the unknown nonlinear robot behave like a
prescribed robot impedance model as perceived by a human operator. In contrast to most existing neural network
and adaptive impedance based control methods, no information of the task performance (e.g. specifically no
reference trajectory information) is required in the inner loop. Then, a task-specific outer-loop controller is designed
to find the best parameters of the prescribed robot impedance model to adjust the robot's dynamics to the operator's
skills to effectively perform a given task. The outer loop includes the human operator dynamics and all the task
performance details. Given the inner-loop neuro-adaptive robot controller, three different outer loop designs are
given for robot-assisted task performance. Experimental results on a PR2 robot demonstrate the effectiveness of this
approach in using the robot to improve the human's performance of a motion task.
