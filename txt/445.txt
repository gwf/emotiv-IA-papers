Abstract. This paper introduces identification results of human response to virtual 3D face stimuli. Observations
of human reactions are done using preprocessed EEG (electroencephalogram) signals: excitement, meditation,
frustration, engagement/boredom. Virtual 3D face features – distance between eyes, nose width, and chin width – are
used as stimuli. Cross-correlation analysis demonstrated that dynamical relations between human reactions and stimuli
exist. Input-output models describing relations between stimuli and corresponding human reactions are built. A new
input-output model building method is proposed that allows building stable models with the least output prediction
error. Models’ validation results demonstrate relatively high prediction accuracy of human reactions.

estimation; model validation.

measure and analyze the signals [23]. We have chosen
to use EEG-based signals for human affective state
monitoring because of the reliability and quick
response [18], [6].
In this research, a virtual 3D face was used as
a stimulus for eliciting human reaction. It is known
that the majority of information to another person
when communicating is transferred by face features
[13]. A person is used to react to the smallest
face feature changes during a very short time [21].
We have created and used a realistic virtual 3D
face model. Human reactions when he/she is
observing visual stimuli (3D face changes) were
investigated.
Our previous investigations on the dependencies
between virtual stimuli and human affective responses
demonstrated that in certain circumstances the
dependencies exist and there is a need of further
research [20].
Three types of stimuli in virtual 3D face (distance
between eyes, nose width and chin width) were used
for human reaction elicitation and four response
signals (excitement, meditation, engagement/boredom,
and frustration) were observed. The aim of the
investigation is to identify the relationships between
stimuli and reactions to them and to describe those
using mathematical models that can predict human
reactions in high accuracy and can be used for human
state control systems design.

1. Introduction
Virtual environments are becoming a part of our
daily life including computer games, work tasks,
various mental and physical training programs,
e-learning, online shopping, and specialized software.
These environments affect the users in different
extents and ways. The influence can be both
positive and negative. Various studies introduce
investigations, where human state observation is an
important task. Several of them concentrates on
stress evaluation and training when using virtual
environments for military purposes and curing
post-traumatic stress disorder [15]. Other focuse on
neuro-marketing [11], [12], adaptive virtual mediator
services [14], social networks [22], and learning
applications [1], [4].
In order to protect people from various harmful
effects to their health (e.g. stress) that virtual
environment can cause [17], to create training
applications, or to implement/use virtual mediator
services [7], control mechanisms of virtual
environment object features and the interactions have
to be modeled [5], [10].
The most effective way to observe a state of a
person in a real time is to monitor human bio-signals
[19]. A variety of human bio-signals such as galvanic
skin response, pulse, magnetoencephalography
(MEG), heart rate, EEG, etc. are used for this
purpose and plenty of methods and techniques help to

largest/smallest value and zero (normal face) was 10 s.
The features were changing continuously: from
normal to extremely wide, then back to normal and to
extremely thin, then again to normal and to extremely
wide and again back to normal. The animated tests
were prepared for every of three features: distance
between eyes, nose width and chin width.

2. Observations and data
Features of virtual 3D face (distance between eyes,
nose width, and chin width) were used for input and
EEG-based human reaction signals (excitement,
meditation, frustration, engagement/boredom) of a
person were measured as output (Fig. 1). These output
signals were chosen as important features in learning,
and stress regulation. The output signals were
recorded using Emotive Epoc device.The device
records EEG inputs from 14 channels (according to
international 10-20 locations): AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7,
P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, AF4 [3].

Figure 1. Input-Output scheme for the experiments

TYPE 2 input signals (Fig. 3, bottom) were formed
when changing the 3D face features suddenly. “Small
distance-between-eyes”, “thin nose” or “thin chin”
was shown for some period of time, then the picture
was suddenly changed to “normal” and after some
time to “large distance-between-eyes”, “wide nose” or
“wide chin” and again to “normal”. It was repeated
two times with different time steps between each
change. “Neutral” face was equal to 0, “largest distance-between-eyes”, “widest nose” or “widest chin”
were equal to 1.25 and the smallest features – to -1.25.
Output signals – excitement, meditation,
frustration and engagement/boredom – varied from 0
to 1. If excitement, meditation, frustration and engagement were low, the value was 0 or close to 0 and if
they were high, the values of parameters were 1 or
close to 1. The signals were recorded with the
sampling period of T0=0.5 s.
Five volunteers (volunteers no. 1-3 were female,
and volunteers no. 4-5 were male) were tested. A
volunteer was watching three animated scenes of
approximately 1 minute one after another, and
EEG-based signals were measured simultaneously
using Emotiv Epoc device. The recorded preprocessed
signals were stored for later analysis.

Seven 3D woman faces were created using
Autodesk MAYA. One 3D woman face was used as a
“neutral” one (Fig. 2, middle). The other faces were
formed by changing face features in an extreme
manner: large and small distance between eyes (Fig. 2,
left and right, top), wide and thin nose (Fig. 2, left and
right, middle), wide and thin chin (Fig. 2, left and
right, bottom). After importing the 3D faces into Unity
3D engine, the transitions between the same kind of
features in the face were programmed using morph
target’s method.

Figure 2. A “neutral” 3D woman face (middle) and limit
cases of features: the largest (left top) and the smallest (right
top) distance between eyes, the widest (left middle) and the
thinnest (right middle) nose, the widest (left bottom) and the
thinnest (right bottom) chin

3. Correlation analysis
To estimate the possible relations between virtual
stimuli and human reaction signals, a cross-correlation
analysis between stimuli (3D virtual face features) and
response (EEG-based reaction) signals was performed.
Cross-covariation functions between input and
output signals and auto-covariation functions of input
and output signals are used for this purpose [16]:

There were two types of input signals used.
TYPE 1 input signals (Fig. 3, top) were formed when
neutral face was equal to 0, the largest (widest) feature
was equal to 1.8 and the smallest (thinnest) feature
was equal to -1.8. The values in-between were
changed
linearly.

5. Models validation
Every stimuli type requires 12 input-output models
for each volunteer. Each model is selected from five
possible models (when n=1, 2; m=0, …, n) using the
rule (21). Two types of stimuli for each of five
volunteers were used, so 120 models were analyzed.
The analysis of five volunteers’ data showed that
relations between each of three stimuli (distance
between eyes, nose width, and chin width) and
excitement output signal can be modeled when model
order is 𝑚
� = 0 and 𝑛� = 1. Relations between each of
three stimuli and meditation, frustration and
engagement/boredom output signals are best modeled
when model order is 𝑚
� = 0 and 𝑛� = 2.
Every model was validated through the output
signal (excitement, meditation, engagement/boredom,
frustration) prediction analysis. The predicted output
signals have the following expression [8]:

(21)

𝑚 = 0,1, … , 𝑛

where 𝛿 > 0 is a chosen constant value. Usually in the
practice of identification 𝛿 ∈ [0,001 ÷ 0,01] what

Identification of Human Response to Virtual 3D Face Stimuli

Results of model validation demonstrate that
average absolute relative prediction errors of
meditation and engagement/boredom signals in all
five volunteer cases were less than 1.5 %, frustration –
less than 3.5 %, and excitement – less than 10 %. The
corresponding relative error standard deviation
averages are less than 2 % for meditation and
engagement/boredom, less than 4.5 % for frustration
and less than 15 % for excitement output signals.
Predictive models are necessary in the design of
predictor-based self-tuning control systems [2], [9].
High prediction accuracies of the built models allow
expecting that they can be a basis for this type control
systems of human reactions to virtual stimuli. Such
systems could serve as a mean for regulation of
human attention level in learning applications as well
as in computerized workplaces for dispatchers.

6. Conclusions
Cross-correlation analysis demonstrated that there
is a relatively high correlation between stimuli (input)
and human response (output) and that evidences the
existence of linear dynamic relations between them.
When using cross- and auto-correlation functions,
a new method for building an input-output model was
proposed. It allows building a stable model for output
signal prediction with the least prediction error. The
models allow describing the dynamic dependencies
between virtual 3D face that changes during time and
the reactions to it.
Validation results of the models demonstrate that
every volunteer reacted to the stimuli individually and
the reactions are described by input-output models
with different estimates of polynomial coefficient.
The models describe the dependencies between
every input signal (distance between eyes, nose width
and chin width) and every corresponding output signal
(excitement, meditation, engagement/boredom, and
frustration) in high accuracy: averages of absolute
relative prediction errors of engagement/boredom and
meditation signals in five volunteer cases were less
than 1.5 %, frustration – less than 3.5 %, and
excitement – less than 10 %.
