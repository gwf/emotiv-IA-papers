Background: A number of benefits have been described for the long-term practice of
meditation, yet little is known regarding the immediate neurological and cardiovascular
responses to meditation. Wireless sensor technology allows, for the first time,
multi-parameter and quantitative monitoring of an individual’s responses during
meditation. The present study examined inter-individual variations to meditation through
continuous monitoring of EEG, blood pressure, heart rate and its variability (HRV) in
novice and experienced meditators.

Cardiovascular and nervous system
changes during meditation.
Front. Hum. Neurosci. 9:145.
doi: 10.3389/fnhum.2015.00145

Methods: Participants were 20 experienced and 20 novice meditators involved in a
week-long wellness retreat. Monitoring took place during meditation sessions on the first
and last full days of the retreat. All participants wore a patch that continuously streamed
ECG data, while half of them also wore a wireless EEG headset plus a non-invasive
continuous blood pressure monitor.
Results: Meditation produced variable but characteristic EEG changes, significantly
different from baseline, even among novice meditators on the first day. In addition,
although participants were predominately normotensive, the mean arterial blood pressure
fell a small (2–3 mmHg) but significant (p < 0.0001) amount during meditation. The
effect of meditation on HRV was less clear and influenced by calculation technique and
respiration. No clear relationship between EEG changes, HRV alterations, or mean blood
pressure during meditation was found.
Conclusion: This is the first study to investigate neurological and cardiovascular
responses during meditation in both novice and experienced meditators using novel,
wearable, wireless devices. Meditation produced varied inter-individual physiologic
responses. These results support the need for further investigation of the short- and
long-term cardiovascular effects of mental calm and individualized ways to achieve it.

Introduction
There is no doubt of a strong mind-heart connection, although it remains poorly understood.
The critical nature of this connection is exemplified by stress-induced cardiomyopathy (Takutsubo cardiomyopathy), the ECG and cardiac biomarker changes with acute brain injury, and

volunteers meeting the criteria for inclusion in the experienced
meditator group and the first 20 meeting criteria as a novice meditator. Identification of experience and novice meditators was for
study purposes only and had no influence on their activities during the week. Experienced meditators self-identified to having a
regular meditation practice for over 3 months of = 70 min per
week, whereas novice meditators self-identified as either having
never seriously tried meditation, or having not meditated more
than once a week during the prior 3 months. Exclusion criteria
were; (1) Chronic requirement for the daily use of chronotropically active medications, (2) having an implantable pacemaker,
or (3) known allergy to adhesives. Demographics of the study
volunteers are in Table 1.
The trial was registered on clinicaltrials.gov web site;
NCT01975415.

the heightened cardiovascular risk associated with depression,
post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health problems. Many of these interactions are believed to be mediated by
the autonomic nervous system, which evidence suggests can be
influenced through meditation (Ditto et al., 2006; Telles et al.,
2013). However, greater widespread acceptance of meditation
as a potentially important tool for improving population health
and wellness is hampered by the limited data available defining its benefits. In addition, understanding how that response
can influence cardiovascular function could help guide nonpharmacologic treatments of hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders (Burns et al., 2007; Djindjic et al., 2012; Mancia
and Grassi, 2014).
While there have been a large number of studies on meditation, a 2007 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
(AHRQ) evidence-based review classified the >800 studies as
being of “. . . predominately poor quality...” (Ospina et al., 2007).
Nonetheless, there is compelling evidence through functional
MRI and EEG studies of significant changes in central nervous
system (CNS) function during meditation, albeit primarily in
studies limited to expert meditators (Lutz et al., 2004; Garrison
et al., 2013). Other studies have explored the impact of meditation
on autonomic nervous system (ANS) function predominately via
changes in heart rate variability (HRV) with many but not all
finding meditation to be associated with increases in HRV (Choi
and Gutierrez-Osuna, 2011; Nesvold et al., 2012). While the acute
effect of meditation on blood pressure has previously only been
studied in a limited fashion (Barnes et al., 1999; Ditto et al., 2006)
there is adequate evidence of a long-term benefit of a meditation practice to prompt the most recent hypertension treatment
guidelines to give transcendental meditation a level IIB recommendation for the treatment of high blood pressure (Brook et al.,
2013).
The recent availability of wireless mobile health (mHealth)
devices for the continuous, non-obtrusive, passive monitoring,
and transmission of numerous biometric parameters allows, for
the first time, a more comprehensive and detailed evaluation of
the acute neurological and cardiovascular responses to meditation. In the current study we utilized these technologies to evaluate the acute cardiovascular and nervous system responses in
both experienced and novice meditators during mantra meditation to better understand the acute relationship between CNS,
ANS and blood pressure changes during meditation.

Monitoring
All 40 meditators wore a HealthPatch by VitalConnect
(http://www.vitalconnect.com/healthpatch). This device is an
adhesive patch worn on the chest that monitors and wirelessly
transmits a single-lead ECG, heart rate and respiratory rate to
an iOS device. Using the raw ECG data heart rate variability was
determined.
A total of 20 meditators, 10 experienced and 10 novices,
also had their EEG’s and blood pressures monitored continuously during meditation sessions. For EEG monitoring a
multichannel, wireless headset, the Emotiv EPOC was used
(https://emotiv.com). The EPOC uses a set of 14 sensors plus
2 references and connects wirelessly to Windows-based personal computers. For continuous, non-invasive blood pressure monitoring the Sotera ViSi Mobile system was used
(http://www.visimobile.com). It is a multi-parameter vital signs
monitoring system capable of continuous measurement and
wireless transmission of core vital signs that utilizes pulse transition time to track blood pressure in a non-obtrusive manner.
All wireless device data was transmitted in real time to a
HuNet Base Station (Huneo, Inc.) via a digital interface. There
the data were compressed and sent to a secure, HIPAA-compliant

cloud-based data storage. The data from the EPOC and HealthPatch devices were time-synchronized to the Internet during data
acquisition whereas ViSi data were collected and time stamped on
a local server that was also synchronized when later aggregated
with other sensor data.

Participants also recorded their level of distraction in relation
to the number of devices worn during the meditation. Distraction level was dichotomized (distracted vs. not distracted) and a
χ2 -test was used to compare distraction between the one device
group and three-device group.

Meditation Sessions
Cardiovascular and Respiratory

Volunteers were fitted with their monitoring devices on the
morning of the first full day of the meditation retreat and again
on the last full day. All devices were removed following the monitoring sessions with a total monitoring time of approximately
60–90 min for each of the two sessions. The general make-up of
monitoring sessions is demonstrated in Figure 1.
Meditation sessions occurred in a large ballroom with all
retreat participants receiving the same instructions and guidance
on silent mantra meditation. All were instructed to close their
eyes, relax their muscles, take a deep breath and exhale right
before meditation began. No specific breathing instructions were
given for the period of meditation. At the end of the meditation
period a chime was rung and all were asked to release the repetition of the mantra and to then sit quietly for a few minutes before
opening their eyes.
After the meditation session individuals sat quietly, listening
to talks for ∼10–20 min. This was followed by a 4 min guided
deep breathing exercise (pranayama). For the breathing exercise
individuals were guided through cycles of inhalation for 4 s, hold
for 4 s, and then exhale for 4 s via alternating nostrils. After the
breathing exercises monitoring was completed.
Over the ensuing 4 days between the first and last monitored
sessions all participants received continued instruction and practice in meditation, yoga and other activities supporting inner
calm in individual and group settings.

Respiratory rate
Respiratory rate was directly measured with the HealthPatch and
was successfully determined in all 40 individuals on the first day
but only 29 individuals on the last day. Respiratory rate was
documented in breaths per minute.

Heart rate variability
Analyzable data for heart rate and HRV was available for 40 participants on the first day of monitoring, but on the second day
data for 11 participants was either not recoverable or deemed
not useful for analyses (e.g., recording abruptly concluded during the meditation session). Artifacts in RR interval data were
filtered using an adaptive filter performed on the raw RR interval data from each study participant on both monitoring days
(Dos Santos et al., 2013). In brief, this procedure identifies proximal and global outliers in RR interval data, simulates a more
likely measurement based on proximal data points, and replaces
outliers with the simulated values in an iterative process. Heart
rate variability analysis was quantified on filtered RR interval data
using both time-domain and frequency-domain approaches. The
root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) between
adjacent RR intervals was calculated for each study participant
separately for periods during the meditation session and up
to 10 min immediately following meditation on both days. In
this analysis, RR interval data from the first and last minute
of the meditation session, and the first minute after the meditation session concluded were omitted from the analysis to
eliminate the possibility of artifacts induced by study participants transitioning from the non-meditation session to meditation session, and again to a non-meditation session. A Wilcoxon
signed-rank test was used to compare heart rate variability (RMSSD) between meditation and non-meditation sessions

Data Analysis
The primary outcomes of interest were HRV as calculated from
R-R intervals (the time between consecutive R waves on an
ECG), continuously monitored mean arterial pressure, and EEG
changes. Meditation-associated changes in the measured biometrics were compared to the post meditation period due to the
consistent period of relaxed listening during that time.

breathing exercise individuals were guided through cycles of inhalation for
4 s, hold for 4 s, and then exhale for 4 s via alternating nostrils. The final
monitoring session was similar to the first with the meditation session lasting
24 min, followed by 10 min of quietly sitting and listening to speakers and
then 4 min of guided breathing.

FIGURE 1 | General make up of time period in which participants
were monitored. On the first day all participated in a mantra meditation
session lasting 26 min, after which they remained in place, listening to
speakers for another 20 min, followed by a 4 min guided deep breathing
exercise (pranayama), after which monitoring was complete. For the

gamma (25–40 Hz) bands. Individual channel data was censored
according to the measured contact quality for each sensor (yellow or green indicators, corresponding to contact impedance less
than approximately 80 k Ohm, significantly lower than the 1M
Ohm input impedance of the EPOC amplifiers) and residual artifacts not captured by the automated processing were removed
statistically using outlier analysis or by manual filtering.
Data was time synchronized to match the recorded periods of
relaxed preparation (Pre-meditation), Mantra Meditation, PostMeditation relaxation, and Breathing Exercise. Clear regions of
the Pre-meditation period were selected to avoid strong motions
artifacts as the subjects were entering the room and settling for
the session, and also to select for periods of normal eyes-open
relaxation indicated by the observation of occasional eye blink
artifacts in the frontal channels.
Spectral power distributions were plotted for selected sessions
in each phase using EEGLab (Delorme and Makeig, 2004). Various measures of mental activity and distribution were calculated
and accumulated across subgroups of user sessions and were analyzed using SPSS to demonstrate significance of mean differences
using ANOVA methods (in all cases presented p < 0.002 was
verified). Derived features including Relative Gamma and Emotiv’s “Meditation Score” were analyzed for differences between
user groups and states. The Meditation Score was developed by
Emotiv based on characteristic EEG signatures obtained in meditating individuals derived of the best spectral features and distribution patterns. Although gamma responses can be obscured by
EMG signals (Pope et al., 2009) we chose to evaluate the Relative
Gamma parameter as it has been previously shown to increase
during meditation among expert meditators, but not in novice
meditators (Lutz et al., 2004). It is derived from the ratio of the
gamma band power to the sum of the alpha and theta band
powers.

collectively, and also stratified by meditation experience on each
monitoring day.
Spectral density analysis was performed using a Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) on the filtered RR interval data in 30 s segments
beginning 15 min prior to the mediation session and ending 15
and 10 min after the conclusion of the meditation session on
the first and second day of monitoring, respectively. Normalized high frequency (nuHF) spectral band power was derived
by dividing the high frequency (0.15–0.40 Hz) spectral power by
the sum of the low frequency (0.04–0.15) power plus high frequency power. Natural log high frequency (lnHF) power was also
calculated. Spectral density plots were used to visualize changes
associated with meditation. Similarly, a spectral density analysis
was performed during the 4 min guided breathing sessions.

Continuous blood pressure
Data from the ViSi Mobile was either not recoverable or deemed
not useful for analyses for 4 and 5 participants on the first and
second monitoring day, leaving analyzable data for 16 and 15
individuals, respectively. Gross outlier measurements of mean
arterial pressure were removed prior to analyses. As in the assessment of heart rate variability, mean arterial pressure was compared between the meditation session and following 15 min and
10 min non-meditation sessions on the first and second monitoring day, respectively. Therefore, mean arterial pressure was
modeled as a function of meditation session using a mixed
effect autoregressive model to account for the repeated, temporal dependency of the measurements. Analyses were conducted
collectively among all study participants, and also stratified by
meditation experience on each monitoring day.

Electroencephalogram
Emotiv EPOC EEG neuro-headsets were fitted to 20 volunteer subjects on each of 2 days. Due to discomfort or distraction several volunteers declined to complete the measurement,
and due to contact difficulties in the fitment of headsets and
the rapid evaporation of saline solvent 8 of 40 data files were
incomplete and 4 were not usable. Data was bracketed into Premeditation, Mantra Meditation, Post Meditation relaxation, and
Deep Breathing exercises. The final data set consisted of 15 complete files on the first day (9 experienced and 6 novices), with 2
cases that did not capture EEG data during the Breathing Exercise. The data set from the final day consisted of 11 complete
files (4 experienced and 7 novices), with a further 3 cases missing Breathing Exercises and 3 cases missing both Post Meditation
relaxation and Breathing Exercises. In total there were 10 subjects
for whom complete datasets were collected over both sessions.
Real time EEG data and proprietary Emotiv “Affectiv” data
were recorded to files and post analyzed. Each EEG file was bandpass filtered in the range 4–40 Hz using a 5 th order Butterworth
filter, motion, and ocular artifacts were removed using automated
and manual processing methods, and the remaining data divided
into 2 s contiguous epochs at a 50% overlap factor. The data was
windowed (Hanning filter) and passed into a FFT process using
Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc. www.mathworks.com) and band
power data from each sensor was produced in the theta (4–8 Hz),
alpha (8–12 Hz), low beta (12–18 Hz), high beta (18–25 Hz) and

Role of Funding Source
The study was funded through a grant from the Chopra
Foundation. Co-investigators who are affiliated with the Chopra
Center for Wellness helped design the study and recruit participants. They played no role in data acquisition or analysis but did
critically review the final manuscript.

Results
Subjective Perception of Monitoring
All study participants wore their assigned monitoring devices
during both sessions with the exception of two individuals who
chose not to wear the EEG headset on the second day due to
discomfort. Participants were asked after the second monitoring session to rank on a scale of 0–10 (0 = not at all distracted,
5 = somewhat distracted, 10 = very distracted) how distracting
they found the devices. Two individuals in each device group did
not record their distraction level. For those assigned to just the
HealthPatch the mean score was 0.72, with 50% of the participants reporting no distraction from the single device. In comparison, among the 18 individuals assigned all 3 sensors the mean
score was 2.89 with 20% reporting experiencing no distraction
during the meditation (p < 0.05).

Cardiovascular and Respiratory Changes
Respiratory Rate

However, when using frequency domain measurements the
changes were more heterogeneous, possibly influenced by variation in respiratory rates between individuals, as demonstrated
by comparisons of different analysis methods in representative individuals (Figure 2). Normalized High Frequency (nuHF)
spectral power was similar in both experienced and novice
meditators on the first and last day of monitoring (Table 2
and Figure 3). While on the first day there was no significant
difference in nuHF between meditation and post meditation
periods (p = 0.48), on the last day nuHF was significantly
increased during meditation compared to post meditation rest
(p < 0.001). Similar trends were observed when examining
lnHF.
An exploratory analysis was carried out comparing changes
in the frequency domain of HRV during guided breathing exercise compared to mantra meditation. Due to its short duration
time domain analysis was not possible. In contrast to the spectral density analysis during meditation a substantial fraction of
study participants showed a prominent low frequency peak at

For the entire study population, over both days of monitoring,
no significant changes were noted in either respiratory rate during meditation relative to the period of calm following meditation, although respiratory rate tended to be slower in both novice
and experienced meditators during meditation (Table 2). When
comparing experienced vs. novice meditators a statistically significant, albeit clinically small, greater decrease in respiratory rate
was found among experienced meditators on the first but not last
day of meditation (Table 3).

Heart Rate Variability
No significant change in heart rate was noted during meditation
in either cohort or on either day of monitoring.
HRV changes in the time domain using the RMSSD demonstrated a relatively consistent decrease during the period of
mantra meditation that was statistically significant in experienced
meditators (p < 0.01) with a trend in novices (p = 0.053).

cohort (Table 2). This was most pronounced in novice meditators

2 mmHg (p = 0.061) in experienced meditators. Although blood
pressure, on average, was significantly decreased with meditation there was substantial variability in response with the greatest decrease in mean arterial pressure during meditation being
16 mmHg, but also an increase of almost 22 mmHg in another
individual. The time course of these changes over a meditation
session and their relation to each other for two representative
individuals are shown in Figure 4.

Relationship between Parameters
In order to evaluate for potential relationships between CNS,
ANS, and cardiorespiratory changes during meditation and
guided breathing exploratory analyses were carried out. No significant relationship was found between EEG changes and HRV
as measured by nuHF (p = 0.17 and p = 0.16 for Relative
Gamma and p = 0.47 and p = 0.50 for Meditation Score for
Days one and two, respectively). Nor was there a significant relationship between breathing rate and HRV during meditation or
guided breathing. On the other hand a significant association was
found between the change in mean arterial blood pressure and
nuHF during guided breathing (slope = 2.6844, p = 0.01) on the
first day, but not last day (p = 0.40) or during meditation on
either day (p = 0.89 and p = 0.07) (Figure 6).

Electroencephalogram Changes
In order to describe global EEG changes associated with meditation we focused primarily on changes in relative gamma power
and the Emotiv Meditation Score. A representative example
of changes in these parameters over the monitoring period in
an experienced meditator is shown in Figure 5 as well as the
cohort-based values during the various activities on the 2 days
of monitoring. Both novice and experienced meditators experienced statistically significant changes in their Meditation Score
and Relative Gamma power compared to non-meditation rest
(Table 2). The degree of change in both Relative Gamma and
the Meditation Score was significantly greater in the experienced
relative to the novice meditators (p = 0.04 and p = 0.016,
respectively).
After the week of training the experienced meditators still
demonstrated a numerically greater degree of EEG changes
with meditation relative to novices although that difference was
smaller compared to the first day and no longer statistically
significant (p = 0.35 for relative gamma and p = 0.36 for
Meditation Score).
Other EEG findings of note were that experienced meditators
demonstrated high alpha power during all phases of the experiment including during the pre-meditation stages, whereas this
was absent in novice meditators during the first day of monitoring but were significantly enhanced in the pre-meditation

Discussion
While meditation has been practiced for millennia, and has
been extensively studied, many uncertainties remain around the
physiologic changes that occur during meditation, in particular
the acute changes in non-expert and novice meditators (Ospina
et al., 2007). In the current study we were able to take advantage of the relatively non-obtrusive and continuous monitoring
capabilities offered through the use of multiple wireless medical devices to continuously monitor heart rate and HRV, blood
pressure, respiration and EEG in novice, and experienced meditators with minimal disruption to their mantra meditation practice.
In addition, we were able to track for changes in response after
the novice meditators gained experience through comprehensive
immersion in a meditative practice.

As has been previously documented, we found the practice
of meditation to be associated with significant changes in brain
activity (Lutz et al., 2004). While prior studies have focused primarily on EEG changes in expert or experienced meditators we
were able to demonstrate in first-time meditators small but significant EEG changes during their first attempt at meditation.
With further practice we were able to detect a trend toward
greater EEG changes with meditation in novice meditators. Contrary to a prior study of expert Tibetan monk meditators where a
significant increase in Relative Gamma power was found (Lutz
et al., 2004), our volunteers showed a consistent and significant decrease in this parameter during meditation. The decrease
in gamma power noted in our study, in contrast to prior EEG

The uniqueness of the monitoring equipment used in this
study allowed for several novel findings. This is the first study
we are aware of that monitored blood pressure—continuously
and unobtrusively—before, during and after meditation. Due
to the disruptive nature of blood pressure cuff inflation prior
studies were only able to measure blood pressure before and
after meditation (Tsai et al., 2014). Using the only noninvasive
FDA-approved device for continuous blood pressure monitoring
we were able to confirm a small but significant drop in blood
pressure during a period of meditation, notably in a predominately normotensive population. However, we were unable to
identify a clear connection between meditation-related CNS or
ANS changes and blood pressure changes.

studies in experienced meditators may be related to the fact that
our volunteers were practicing a concentrative (meditating on a
mantra) form of meditation, which may exhibit more of a slow
oscillatory component (von Stein et al., 2009). Beyond differences
in meditation focus, other potential explanations for our findings
could be due to meditation artifact due to EMG interference, or
related to the experience of the vastly greater experience of the
monks studied previously, with 10,000 to 50,000 h of meditation
experience, relative to our volunteers.
While we documented clear CNS changes with meditation, we
were unable to definitively confirm ANS associated changes, at
least as measured through changes in HRV. An unexpected finding from this study was that meditation was not associated with
an increase in HRV as has been identified in many (Peng et al.,
1999) but not all prior studies of various forms of meditation
(Peng et al., 2004; Tsai et al., 2014). In fact, using the recommended method for measuring short term changes in HRV in the
time domain, (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology
the North American Society of Pacing Electrophysiology, 1996)
RMSDD, we found a statistically significant decrease in HRV during meditation. Interestingly, expected changes in HRV as evidenced by greater coherence was much more evident in the vast
majority of meditators during guided breathing rather than during meditation (Nijjar et al., 2014), although this coherence was
at low frequency, which would be anticipated when respiratory
rate related. Because guided breathing was only of 4 min duration
it is difficult to make valid comparisons between HRV changes
during meditation relative to deep breathing, but our results do
suggest that changes in HRV might be strongly influenced by respiration potentially masking more subtle changes associated with
decreases in sympathetic and increases in parasympathetic tone.
One measure of HRV that can help control for the influence of
respiration is normalized high frequency power (nuHF) (Burr,
2007). We did identify a significant increase in nuHF but only
on the final day of monitoring. This may be related to meditators being nervous on their first day of meditation, whereas by
the end of the week, when all meditators were more comfortable

in the group environment and with the monitoring equipment,
and novice meditators had more experience, the subtle findings
of the calming effects of meditation were more apparent.
There are several limitations to this study. Reflecting the nonlaboratory setting of the study some participants data was not
analyzable potentially influencing our power to detect more subtle changes or associations. The increased real world usability
of the sensor technology utilized, in particular the EEG, brings
limitations in accuracy relative to standard medical systems
(Duvinage et al., 2013). The use of Emotiv’s proprietary Meditation Score also unfortunately limits its reproducibility of this
one measure when different EEG systems are utilized. In addition monitoring periods were relatively short, and ended rapidly
after guided breathing exercises which impacted our ability to
fully explore physiologic responses to respiratory changes.

Conclusion
This is the first study to intensively monitor novice and experienced individuals during meditation for CNS, ANS, and blood
pressure changes. Our results, within the limitations noted above,
support that the inter-individual physiologic response to mediation by non-expert meditators is heterogeneous, as we were
able to document through multiple real-time continuous metrics.
Nonetheless we were able to show that meditation led to significant, measureable EEG changes even in individuals just beginning a meditation practice. Our most novel, and reliable finding
however was that meditation was associated with a small, but statistically significant decrease in blood pressure in a normotensive
population.
