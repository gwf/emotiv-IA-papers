In an increasingly multicultural society, the way people perceive individuals from the
same vs different ethnic groups greatly affects their own and societal well-being. Two
psychological effects that influence these perceptions are the Mere-Exposure Effect
(MRE), wherein familiarity with certain objects or persons suffices for people to develop
a preference for them, and the Baby Schema (BS), a set of specific facial features that
evokes caregiving behaviors and an affective orientation in adults. In the present study,
we aimed to investigate whether these two effects play a role in implicit physiological
responses to babies vs. adults faces belonging to participants in-group vs. out-group.
In study 1, the pupillary diameter of 62 Caucasian participants (M = 31; F = 31) who
observed adult and infant faces of different ethnic groups (Caucasian, Chinese) was
measured. In study 2, brain waves of 38 Caucasian participants (M = 19; F = 19), who
observed the same set of faces, were recorded using EEG. In both studies, adults explicit
preferences (i.e., attitudes) toward faces were assessed using questionnaires. In Study
1, females showed greater attention to infant than adult faces (BS effect) in both pupils,
regardless of the ethnic group of the face. By contrast, males attended to infant more than
adult faces for out-group faces only (BS effect). In Study 2, greater left posterior-parietal
alpha activation toward out-group compared to in-group adult faces was found in males
(MRE). Participants with a low BS effect toward in-group baby faces exhibited greater left
posterior alpha activation to out-group than in-group baby faces (MRE). These findings
reveal how different levels of sensitivity to in-group infants may moderate perceptions of
both in-group and out-group baby faces. Questionnaire measures on attitudes showed
that males and females preferred in-group to out-group adult faces (MRE). Participants in
Study 2 also reported a greater preference for infants than adults faces (BS effect). These
findings explicate the roles of gender and the Baby Schema effect in moderating implicit
processing of in-group and out-group faces, despite their lack in moderating explicit
reports. Contradictory findings at the implicit (physiological) and explicit (self-report) levels
suggest that differential processing of faces may occur at a non-conscious level.

Explicit and Implicit Face Processing

1. INTRODUCTION

constriction is the increased light intensity and while Hess (1972)
suggested that constriction occurs in response to unpleasant or
distasteful visual stimuli, other recent studies (Mathôt et al.,
2013; Mathôt and Van der Stigchel, 2015; Landi and Freiwald,
2017; Winn et al., 2018; Zekveld et al., 2018) underlined that
distinct cognitive processes, including attentional, emotional
and motivational ones, may differently intervene in mediating
the strength of pupillary constriction. For example, Landi
and Freiwald (2017) found that greater constrictions occur
in response to familiar stimuli than unfamiliar ones. The
pupillometry has been used in order to study several variables
involved in face processing (i.e., age, ethnic group, and gender).
Regarding the ethnic group, differential responses to in-group
and out-group are reflected in pupil dilation and constriction.
For instance, Goldinger et al. (2009) and Wu et al. (2012) found
that viewers pupil size was larger when processing out-group
than in-group faces, meaning that more attention is given to outgroup faces. Moreover, Landi and Freiwald (2017) found that
viewers pupil size decrease considerably when processing familiar
faces compared to unfamiliar ones, suggesting that familiar faces
request fewer cognitive resources in order to be processed. These
studies show that the Mere Exposure Effect is reliably observed
using measures of pupillometry.
Another variables that have been investigated are gender and
age. In accordance with known gender effects of Baby Schema,
women display relatively larger pupillary dilation, which means
greater attention to certain stimuli, when they view pictures of
infants than people of other ages (Hess and Polt, 1960). To our
knowledge, no studies have found larger pupillary responses for
adult faces compared to baby faces in female participants. Thus,
the Baby Schema effect is sensitively captured by pupillometry.
Several studies (Andrew et al., 1982; Hamilton and Vermeire,
1988; Prior et al., 2002; Regolin et al., 2004) have also found
that the pupillary response may variate between pupils and that
this laterality may indicate differentiated processing of stimuli.
For instance, Andrew et al. (1982) found that the left eye of the
domestic chick is more reactive to emotional stimuli compared
to the right one. Hamilton and Vermeire (1988) also claimed that
the domestic chick’s right eye is involved in foraging behavior,
while the left one is engaged in alert behavior. Moreover, Prior
et al. (2002) and Regolin et al. (2004) have proved that the left
eye and its contralateral connections to the right hemisphere are
relevant in the processing of spatial information.
A more complete understanding of physiological responses
requires however measures of both peripheral and central
nervous systems. Pupillometry captures the former, but
electroencephalography (EEG) records brain oscillatory activity
as an index of the latter. Asymmetrical alpha band oscillations
(8–12 Hz) indicate facial preferences (Kang et al., 2015). This
asymmetrical pattern is elicited if stimuli are especially arousing,
regardless of their emotional valence (Balconi and Mazza,
2009). Investigations using infant stimuli have revealed that
electrophysiological activity toward infants faces is greater in
women than in men (Proverbio et al., 2011). Proverbio and
De Gabriele (2017) also showed that there was no observable
difference in electrophysiological activity when viewing infant
faces of different ethnicities, lending support to the wide

Faces are central in social cognition. From a person’s face, we
efficiently extract an immense amount of information (e.g., age
and ethnicity) that guide our behavioral responses (Willis and
Todorov, 2006). Of particular salience is the infant’s face, which
is crucial in the context of parenting. It is well-known that rapid
and appropriate responses to infants needs enable the wholesome
development of social, cognitive, and emotional domains,
whereas incoherent responses lead to adverse developmental
trajectories (Bowlby, 1969; Waters et al., 2000; Furman and
Buhrmester, 2009; Bornstein, 2015). Adults parental responses
have been shown to be facilitated by a rapid shift in attention
toward infants faces. As compared to faces of adults and nonhuman infants/adults, faces of human infants command greater
levels of attention (Brosch et al., 2007). The automatic orientation
to an infant’s face suggests that it serves as a cue to trigger
a distinct set of brain responses that promotes adults adaptive
caregiving (Plutchik, 1987; Seifritz et al., 2003).
Baby Schema refers to the set of physical and behavioral
characteristics typical of babies (such as big round eyes, big head,
and small face, small ears, short limbs, clumsy gait) that evoke
protective caregiving behaviors in adults (Lorenz, 1943; Lorenz
and Martin, 1971). The Baby Schema effect is more evident in
women than in men, suggesting gender differences in processing
infant faces (Baron-Cohen et al., 2003; Glocker et al., 2009a).
However, little is known of whether and how the familiarity of
ethnic in-group facial cues, as compared to less familiar outgroup features, moderates adults responses to infant faces. The
Mere Exposure Effect is a phenomenon by which increased
exposure to an object or person leads to enhanced familiarity
and contributes to developing a preference (Zajonc, 1968). For
instance, Bornstein and Tamis-LeMonda (1989) found that a
wide range of affective responses increases with exposure (e.g.,
pleasantness, liking, etc.), and this effect is applicable to a variety
of stimuli (e.g., abstract paintings, polygons, line drawings,
etc.), including faces. The Mere Exposure Effect suggests that
preference for faces would increase to familiar in-group adult
and infant faces. However, it remains to be seen whether the
protective effect of Baby Schema would lead to an increased
preference for infant faces regardless of whether the face belongs
to an in-group (familiar) or out-group (unfamiliar). Preferences
for facial stimuli can be measured in many ways, such as
by recording autonomic physiological responses. Pupillometry
assesses pupillary response to emotionally relevant visual stimuli.
Dilation of the pupil indicates physiological arousal, reflecting
the activation of the sympathetic branch (i.e., arousal response) of
the autonomic nervous system toward visual stimuli (Hess and
Polt, 1960; Aktar et al., 2016; Wetzel et al., 2016). In general,
larger pupillary dilations are evoked by more pleasant or more
aversive stimuli (Steinhauer, 1983; Bradley et al., 2008). On
the other hand, pupil constriction happens when the circular
muscle contracts, reflecting the activation of the parasympathetic
branch (i.e., calming response) of the autonomic nervous
system. However, the interpretation of the meaning of pupil
constriction is not completely clear and unambiguous. In fact,
while Loewenfeld (1966) argued that the only factor causing pupil

application of protective effects of Baby Schema. EEG has also
been used to examine the Mere Exposure Effect. Thiruchselvam
et al. (2016) showed that increased exposure to infant faces
affects attractiveness ratings and posterior neural reactivity.
In a study using in-group and out-group faces, Zheng and
Segalowitz (2014) learned that group membership influences
brain electrical activity specific to faces. Thus, in addition to
pupillometry, we used EEG to investigate both Baby Schema and
Mere Exposure Effects. Despite past extensive investigation on
this topic, no study has considered how responses to in-group
baby faces and out-group baby faces are associated, and how the
processing of faces in each of these categories may be moderated
by participants gender.
The present study aimed to investigate Baby Schema and Mere
Exposure Effects on adults peripheral and central nervous system
and attitudinal responses to infant and adult faces of ethnic ingroup and out-group. We conducted two studies: Study 1 used
pupillometry in Caucasians (N = 62), and Study 2 recorded
EEG in Caucasians (N = 38). In both studies, participants were
presented with Chinese and Caucasian adults and infants faces.
Alongside implicit neurophysiological measures, adults explicit
attitudes to faces were assessed using a questionnaire. Several
studies, including Glocker et al. (2009a,b) and Caria et al. (2012)
focused on how BS activates the neural system of both females
and males, while others, such as Esposito et al. (2015) explicitly
compared emotional responses in the two genders. However, as
far as we know, no study has taken into account an additional
variable which is the familiarity of faces (in-group vs. outgroup) to investigate how BS influences face processing. The
Life History Theory (LHT) highlights that males and females
of different species exhibit distinct attitudes toward babies and
parental activities (Draper and Harpending, 1982; Mascaro et al.,
2013). They adopt distinct strategies to optimize their fitness:
parenting and mating. As females place more resources in
reproduction (for example for pregnancy and labor), evolution
motivates her to engage in parenting/caregiving activities that
improve the survival and quality of the offspring. Indeed, it
seems that higher rates of reproduction in humans are associated
with lower offspring and parental survivorship, especially for
mothers (Penn and Smith, 2007). On the contrary, since the
investment of males in reproduction is usually lower, evolution
motivates them toward mating. That could explain why females,
compared to males, generally tend to be more sensitive toward
babies. Moreover, in an increasingly multicultural society, the
investigation of psychological factors that may affect the way
people perceive familiar vs unfamiliar individuals (including
infants) become pivotal. Both infant and adult faces of in-group
and out-group ethnicity are thus stimuli that are presumed to
have salient emotional valence, which are probably different in
men and women. This study had four hypotheses. First, we
expected females to exhibit the Baby Schema effect to both ingroup and out-group infant faces. This result would have Baby
Schema prevail over the Mere Exposure Effect. Second, taking
into account that men show a greater MRE compared to women,
we expected an interaction between BS and MRE to be evident
in males. Third, considering that individual differences were
found in previous infant and adult face processing studies (e.g.,

Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org

Bornstein and Tamis-LeMonda, 1989; Lehmann et al., 2013),
we hypothesized that one’s neural activation pattern to in-group
baby faces and out-group adult faces could be correlated. Past
studies have shown that this correlation is gender-dependent.
Generally, women, who are known to have higher levels of
Baby Schema Effect (e.g., Hess and Polt, 1960; Glocker et al.,
2009a), also display higher levels of activation toward out-group
faces compared to in-group faces (Richeson and Trawalter, 2008;
Trawalter et al., 2008). Fourth, we expected females, but not
males, to report no difference in preference between in-group and
out-group infant faces, given that females take a greater interest
in infants in general and are more inclined in caregiving activities
(Maestripieri and Pelka, 2002).

2. STUDY 1
2.1. Materials and Methods
2.1.1. Participants
A total of 62 Caucasian Italian adults (31 males, 31 females,
Mean Age = 22.55 years, SD = 2.57) were recruited through
a database of volunteers available through the University of
Trento web site. Informed consent was obtained from all
participants, and no incentives were provided. Exclusion criteria
were parenthood, pregnancy, and non-Caucasian ethnicity. The
study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles
stated in the Helsinki declaration and it was approved by the IRB
of the Nanyang Technological University.

2.1.2. Stimuli
Used stimuli were drawn from two different available datasets:
asian faces have been selected from Yap et al. (2016), while
caucasian faces used in this work have been provided by the
Computer Vision Laboratory, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia
(Solina et al., 2003; Peer, 2005). Permission has been obtained
for the usage of the images. Forty pictures of faces were shown
to participants. The faces presented belonged to the following
categories that allowed for the manipulation of face age and
ethnic group: (i) Baby Caucasian, (ii) Adult Caucasian, (iii)
Baby Chinese, (iv) Adult Chinese. Pictures represented neutrally
expressive infant and adult female faces (13 × 17 cm) and
were obtained from public domain databases. Stimuli were
presented in black and white and matched for contrast and
brightness using iOS Preview’s Tools. Each face was circled within
a gray frame to exclude possible distracting information such
as hair or background (circle: d = 22 cm, area = 380 cm2 and
circumference = 69 cm). Thus, the stimuli focused on facial
feature information.

2.1.3. Experimental Procedure
Participants arrived in the laboratory for the experimental session
and completed informed consent before starting the experiment.
The experiment took place in a quiet darkened environment.
We recorded pupil change using an eye-tracking device (Tobii
T120, screen: 34 × 27 cm) created by Tobii1 . After eye tracking
calibration, the session started. A within-subjects design was

Explicit and Implicit Face Processing

Regolin et al., 2004), we decided to analyze the data separately
to verify the presence of any differences in our work. To test
hypothesis 1, that females exhibit the Baby Schema effect to
both in-group and out-group infant faces, we undertook a 2 ×
2 × 2 Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with age and ethnicity
of face as within-subjects factors and gender a between-subject
factor; this analysis supported hypothesis 1. After application of a
Bonferroni correction to take into account multiple tests, a main
effect of ethnic group was found on pupil width of both pupils
[left pupils: F (1, 60) = 27.49, p = 2.157496e-06, η2 = 0.0244; right
pupils: F (1, 60) = 35.53, p = 1.430421e-07, η2 = 0.0189]. Posthoc analysis revealed that only women increased pupil diameter
from baseline toward out-group Chinese faces compared to ingroup Caucasian faces [left pupils: t (61) = −3.974, p = 0.0002,
η2 = −0.5047; right pupils: t (61) = −3.6825, p = 0.0005, η2 =
−0.4677]. To test hypothesis 2, that an association between BS
and Mere Exposure Effect (MRE) is evident in males, we observed
for interaction effects from the ANOVA models; this analysis
partially supports our hypothesis. A significant interaction effect
between sex (Males vs. Females) and ethnic group (Caucasian
vs. Chinese) of the face was found [left pupils: F (1, 60) = 8.33,
p = 5.400192e-03, η2 = 0.0075; right pupils : F (1, 60) = 9.82,
p = 2.673374e-03, η2 = 0.0053] and in addition a significant
interaction effect between age (Baby vs. Adult) and ethnic group
(Caucasian vs. Chinese) of the face was found [left pupils: F (1, 60)
= 35.62, p = 1.385729e-07, η2 = 0.0421; right pupils : F (1, 60) =
32.53, p = 3.815601e-07, η2 = 0.0378] (Figure 2).
Post-hoc analysis revealed that for both pupils of women and
men, there was a significant increase in pupil width in response
to Chinese babies faces compared to Caucasian babies faces [left
pupils (females): t (30) = −6.7712, p = 1.652e-07, Cohen’s d =
−1.0629; right pupils (females): t (30) = −6.4622, p = 3.861e07, Cohen’s d = −0.9946; left pupils (males): t (30) = −4.0984,
p = 0.0003; Cohen’s d = −0.4358; right pupils (males): t (30) =
−3.4548, p = 0.001665, Cohen’s d = −0.3799]. In females and
males, both pupil widths were significantly wider in response to
Chinese baby faces compared to Chinese Adult faces [left pupils
(females): t (30) = 4.5692, p = 7.839e-05, Cohen’s d = 0.6774;
right pupils (females): t (30) = 4.9375, p = 2.779e-05, Cohen’s d
= 0.7047; left pupils (males): t (30) =3.3656, p = 0.0021, Cohen’s
d = 0.3439; right pupils (males): t (30) = 3.2478, p = 0.0029,
Cohen’s d = 0.3290]. Only the pupil widths of female participants
were significantly reduced in response to Caucasian baby faces
compared to Caucasian adult faces [left pupils (females): t (30) =
−2.5445, p = 0.016, Cohen’s d = −0.3868; right pupils (females):
t (30) = −2.581, p = 0.0149, Cohen’s d = −0.3555]. Pupil widths of
female participants significantly increased in response to Chinese
baby faces compared to Caucasian Adult faces [left pupils
(females): t (30) = 4.7998, p = 4.098e-05, Cohen’s d = 0.6177;
right pupils (females): t (30) = 4.6619, p = 6.042e-05, Cohen’s d =
0.5829]. However, only females right pupil significantly decreased
in response to Caucasian baby faces compared to Chinese Adult
faces [right pupils (females): t (30) = −2.8755, p = 0.00735,
Cohen’s d = −0.2618].

used: each participant saw all pictures in random order. In
accordance with previous studies (Bernard et al., 2015; Endendijk
et al., 2018), each face was presented for 4 sec followed by a
recovery period during which a gray screen, with a central cross
served as a fixation point, was displayed for 3 s (Figure 1).
At the conclusion of the procedure, participants completed
a questionnaire about their attitude toward each face. All faces
were presented once again with three questions aimed to assess
participants attitudes: (i) How positive is your attitude toward
the face? (ii) How close do you feel to this individual? and (iii)
How much do you like this individual? Participants answered
each question by moving a sliding cursor on a 0–100 scale,
where 0 represented the most negative emotional valence, and
100 represented the most positive emotional valence.

2.2. Analysis
2.2.1. Preliminary Analysis
Prior to data analysis, pupil width values were examined for
normality, homogeneity of variance, presence of outliers, and
influential cases. Outliers, defined as values 2 standard deviations
above/below the mean, were log-transformed to make the data
conform to normality (Keene, 1995). Average pupil width during
the fixation screen preceding each face was considered as a
baseline. This baseline measure was subtracted from the average
pupil width during the presentation of each face to compute the
change in pupil width specific to each face. Change in pupil width
for each face was then averaged across the categories of infant and
adult in-group and out-group faces (Mathôt, 2018).
Concerning attitudinal responses, participants answers to the
three questions for each face category were highly correlated in
both genders (females’ Attitude and Closeness: Pearson’s r =
0.852, p <2.2e-16; Attitude and Pleasantness: Pearson’s r = 0.871,
p < 2.2e-16; Closeness and Pleasantness: Pearson’s r = 0.947, p <
2.2e-16, and males’ Attitude and Closeness: Pearson’s r = 0.931,
p < 2.2e-16; Attitude and Pleasantness: Pearson’s r = 0.946,
p < 2.2e-16; Closeness and Pleasantness: Pearson’s r = 0.960,
p < 2.2e-16). Therefore, to take the effect of inter-individual
differences on pupil width scores into account, a linear model
between pupil width and attitude scores was run. The residuals
of the model, representing pupil width changes unexplained by
participants’ attitude, were used in further analysis.

2.2.1.1. Inferential analysis
Two three-way ANOVA models (one for the left pupil, one for
the right pupil) were performed with pupil width residuals as
the dependent variable, the two within-subjects factors (face age:
baby/adult; ethnic group: Caucasian/Chinese) and one betweensubject factor (Sex: Male/Female) as the independent variables.
Whenever significant effects emerged, post-hoc analyses were
carried out by performing Student’s t-tests. Effect sizes were
evaluated using Cohen’s d.

2.3. Results
2.3.1. Physiological Results
Since it is well-documented that the right and left hemispheres
process visual stimuli differently and that this lateralization is
also reflected in the pupil variation of the two eyes (Andrew
et al., 1982; Hamilton and Vermeire, 1988; Prior et al., 2002;

Explicit and Implicit Face Processing

FIGURE 1 | The sketch above illustrates the model representation of the stimuli. Faces were presented in a randomized order across participants. Each face was
presented for 4 s followed by an inter-stimulus interval during which a gray screen was shown for 3 s. Face stimuli were selected from Peer (2005) and Yap et al. (2016).

Ultrasharp U2719 WM Monitor. Resolution was set to 1,920
× 1,080, refresh rate: 60.00 Hz). Participants were asked to sit
approximately 50–70 cm away from the screen. At the end of
the presentation, participants completed the same questionnaire
employed in Study 1 regarding their disposition toward each face.

a 2 × 2 × 2 Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with age and ethnicity
of face as within-subjects factors, sex of participants as a betweensubjects factor and attitude score as the dependent variable;
this analysis partially supported our hypothesis. A significant
main effect was found for sex [F (1, 60) = 8.29, p = 5.505286e03, η2 = 4.609139e-02], for ethnic group [F (1, 60) = 126.93, p =
1.929138e-16, η2 = 2.883455e-01] and for age [F (1, 60) = 7.84,
p = 6.855548e-03, η2 = 3.850743e-02]. Moreover, a significant
interaction between sex of participants and ethnic group was
found on attitude scores [F (1, 60) = 11.06, p = 1.509542e-03,
η2 = 3.409557e-02] (Figures 3A,B). Post-hoc analysis revealed
a significant difference in attitude scores in response to adult
faces only [females: t (30) = 6.06, p = 1.1537e-06.001, Cohen’s
d = 1.1277; males: t (30) = 6.29, p = 6.1750e-07, Cohen’s d =
1.5075], where adult Caucasian faces were rated more positively
compared to adult Chinese faces. No significant difference was
found between the attitude scores given to Caucasian and
Chinese babies faces.

3.1.3. Data Acquisition
EEG data were collected using a 14 channel setup (Emotiv EPOC)
and digitized at 128 Hz. Previous research has demonstrated
the reliability of this device for the recording of EEG signals
(Debener et al., 2012; Duvinage et al., 2012; Badcock et al., 2013;
De Vos et al., 2014; Ries et al., 2014). E8 of the 14 channels
were employed in Study 2: four channels for posterior (P7,
P8, 01, 02) and four for anterior areas (F3, F4, F7, F8). Data
was recorded on an external device (Lenovo ThinkPad Intel
Core i5-4210U).

3.1.4. Preprocessing
Preprocessing of EEG data was implemented using the MNE
python package (Gramfort et al., 2013). To reduce the impact
of external sources of noise and artifacts, a band-pass filter
between 0.51 and 45 Hz was applied to the EEG data.
Filtered signals were decomposed into 5 frequency bands—
theta (4, 8 Hz), alpha (8, 12 Hz), beta (13, 26 Hz), gamma
(26, 45 Hz), and delta (0.51, 4 Hz)—by means of Fast
Fourier Transformation. Signals were then normalized, using
standard scores, to take into account between- and withinsubject differences. Finally, for each stimulus presentation (4
s long), the mean activity and its standard deviation was
computed and stored for further analysis. Similar to Study 1,
participants answers to the three questionnaires were highly
correlated (females’ Attitude and Closeness: Pearson’s r =
0.852, p < 2.2e-16; Attitude and Pleasantness: Pearson’s r
= 0.870, p < 2.2e-16; Closeness and Pleasantness:Pearson’s

3.1. Materials and Methods
3.1.1. Participants
A total of 40 Caucasian Italian adults (20 males, 20 females, Mean
Age = 23.175, SD = 2.84) participated. Exclusion criteria were
parenthood, pregnancy, and non-Caucasian ethnicity. Informed
consent was obtained from all participants prior to the study,
and no incentives were given to the participants. This study was
conducted in accordance with the ethical principles stated in the
Helsinki declaration. Two participants (1 male and 1 female)
were omitted from the final analysis because the collected data
was corrupted due to technical malfunctions in EEG recordings.

3.1.2. Stimuli
The same set of faces used in Study 1 was shown to participants
(refer to section 2.1.2). Similarly, faces were presented for 4 s
each in a random order, with a 3-seconds inter-stimulus interval
(ISI) between any two faces, as shown in Figure 1. The stimuli
were presented using TkInter2 on a 29 monitor (DELL 29

residuals were used as the dependent variable in the
regression model.

3.2.1. Physiological Results
To test our first hypothesis, that females exhibit the Baby
Schema (BS) effect to both in-group and out-group infant
faces, we employed a 2 × 2 × 2 ANOVA where age (Baby
vs. Adult) and ethnic group (Caucasian vs. Chinese) of the
faces presented were within-subject factors and participant’s
gender was a between-subject factor; this analysis did not
support the hypothesis. An interaction effect between age
(Baby vs. Adults), ethnic group (Caucasian vs. Chinese) and
participant’s gender was found only in P7 channel for alpha
wave [F (1,36) = 8.66, p = 0.0451040 after Multiple Comparison
Correction, η2 = 7.280281e-02]. Moreover, post-hoc analysis
revealed that males showed a significant increase of P7 alpha’s
amplitude for Caucasian adult faces and a significant decrease in
amplitude for Chinese adult faces (p = 0.004886, η2 = 0.7357)
(Figures 4A,B).
To test our third hypothesis, that in-group Baby Schema Effect
(INBSE) was related to different activation patterns for out-group
stimuli, we undertook a repeated-measures ANCOVA analysis,
with INBSE as a covariate, while the age and ethnicity of the
face presented were within-subject actors; this analysis supported
our hypothesis. A significant three-way interaction between the
age of face, the ethnic group of face, and INBSE (F (1, 36) =
31,49, corrected p = 0.000003, η2 = 0.3050] emerged. We also
found a significant two-way interaction effect between age of face
and INBSE [F (1, 36) = 28.88, p = 0.000005, after Bonferroni
Correction]. Post-hoc analysis revealed that participants with
higher INBSE showed greater activation toward out-group
Adults compared to in-group Adults and that participants
with lower INBSE showed greater activation toward in-group
Adults compared to out-group Adults (p = 0.00015, η2 =

3.1.5.2. Inferential analyses
The first analysis of variance (ANOVA) model tested the effects
of gender in moderating BS (hypothesis 1) and MRE (hypothesis
2). Two within-subjects factors (face age: baby/adults; ethnic
group: Caucasian/ Chinese) and one between-subject factor
(participant gender) were used as independent variables. Posthoc analyses were performed using Student’s t-tests. Level of
significance was corrected using false discovery rate correction.
The second ANOVA model was employed to test whether
neural responses to in-group baby faces were related to outgroup adult faces (hypothesis 3). We created a new variable
to represent the in-group Baby Schema Effect (INBSE) by
subtracting the corrected mean amplitudes for the stimuli “adult
Caucasian” from the corrected mean amplitudes for the stimuli
“baby Caucasian.” A repeated-measures Analysis of Covariance
(ANCOVA) was conducted in which this new variable was
fitted as a covariate. Face age and ethnic group were used
as within-subject factors, and participant gender was used
as between-subjects factor. Finally, a repeated-measure mixed
design ANOVA was conducted to investigate the impact of

4. DISCUSSION

3.2.2. Attitudinal Results

This study investigates the Baby Schema (BS) and Mere Exposure
(MRE) effects on adults implicit and explicit responses to infant
and adult in-group and out-group faces. Baby Schema is a
collection of infant facial features which has been selected by
evolution to inspire caregiving behaviors in adults. MRE dictates
that familiarity leads to preference, which begets the question
of whether the protective effect of BS applies to both in-group
(familiar) and out-group (unfamiliar) infants. We investigated
Italian adults implicit physiological responses using pupillometry
and electroencephalography while they were presented with ingroup (Caucasian) and out-group (Chinese) infant and adult
faces. Questionnaire data were also collected to obtain measures
of participants explicit self-reported preferences of faces.
Results from Study 1 revealed several key findings. First,
females exhibited greater pupillary dilation to out-group infants
than out-group adults (Chinese baby >Chinese adult) and
greater pupillary constriction to in-group infants than in-group
adults (Caucasian baby >Caucasian adult) in both pupils. Two
cross-ethnic group comparisons (i.e., Chinese baby >Caucasian
adult; Caucasian baby >Chinese adult) were observed in the
right pupil while only one was observed in the left pupil (i.e.,
Chinese baby >Caucasian adult). Males showed a BS effect in
both pupils specific to out-group Chinese infants (i.e., Chinese
baby >Chinese adult), thus partially supporting hypothesis 1.
From Study 2, we found greater left posterior-parietal alpha
activation toward familiar in-group (i.e., Caucasian) adult faces
compared to unfamiliar out-group (i.e., Chinese) adult faces
in males. Since alpha activation is inversely related to neural

To test our fourth hypothesis, that preference for in-group and
out-group infant faces do not differ for females, we conducted a 2
× 2 × 2 ANOVA with age and ethnicity of face as within-subjects
factors, sex of participants as a between-subjects factor and
attitude scores as the dependent variable; this analysis partially
supported our hypothesis. From the analysis, we found main
effects of age and ethnic group of a face [age: F (1, 36) = 43.32,
p = 1.1683E-7, η2 = 0.1804; ethnic Group: F (1, 36) = 26.20,
p = 1.044176e-05,η2 = 0.0705]. We also found a significant
interaction between age and ethnic group of the face on attitude
scores for both males and females [F (1, 36) = 46.03, p = 6.3027E8, η2 = 0.0527]. Moreover, we found a significant age of face and
sex of participant interaction, meaning that males and females
treated baby and adult faces differently [F (1, 36) = 7.81, p = 0.008,
η2 = 0.0382]. Post-hoc analysis revealed that Caucasian baby faces
evoked greater positive attitudes compared to Chinese adult faces
in both genders [females: t (18) = 7.112, p = 0.000001, Cohen’s d
= 1.753; males: t (18) = 5.386413, p = 0.00004, Cohen’s d = 1.390].
Only in females was there a greater preference for Caucasian
baby faces compared to Caucasian adult faces [females: t (18) =
3.604883, p = 0.002, Cohen’s d = 0.8181]. Both genders showed
more positive attitudes toward Caucasian adult faces compared
to Chinese adult faces [females: t (18) = 6.809751, p = 0.000002,
Cohen’s d = 1.109; males: t (18) = 7.523347, p = 5.812E-7, Cohen’s
d = 1.733], and Chinese baby faces compared to Chinese adult
faces [Females: t (18) = 6.610146, p = 0.000003, Cohen’s d = 1.323;
Males: t (18) = 4.834543, p = 0.00013, Cohen’s d = 1.109]. No

our study, which in general is a synonym for more attention
given to stimuli (Aktar et al., 2016), means more attention
given to infants than to adults. Hess and Polt (1960) similarly
observed larger pupil dilation in women looking at pictures
of infants than of other people, lending further support to
our findings. Instead, the observed pupil constriction for ingroup babies is more challenging to explain, considering the
non univocal origin of pupil constriction (Loewenfeld, 1966;
Hess, 1972; Mathôt et al., 2013; Mathôt and Van der Stigchel,
2015; Winn et al., 2018; Zekveld et al., 2018). However, in
line with this result, Landi and Freiwald (2017) found that
a greater pupillary constriction occurs in response to familiar
faces compared to unfamiliar ones, suggesting that familiar
faces request fewer cognitive resources in order to be processed.
Therefore, the picture that emerges is that both BS and MRE are
active in females while they process faces of different ages and
ethnicity. This co-existence leads them to show more attention
to infant faces than adult faces but with opposite directions
for Caucasian and Chinese faces due to the familiarity of
the stimuli.
By comparison, the BS effect elicited in males was specific to
out-group faces only, which is in line with our second hypothesis,
that an interaction effect between BS and MRE is likely to be
observed in males. Pupil dilation indicates greater preferential
attention and has been thought to occur during an increase in
processing effort (Kahneman, 1973; Beatty, 1982). As compared
to familiar in-group faces, unfamiliar out-group faces are more
novel and evoke greater attention. The processing of unfamiliar
out-group faces might require the recruitment of more cognitive
resources (Goldinger et al., 2009; Hu et al., 2014). Therefore,
the BS effect which entices adults to attend to infant faces
might have been moderated by the MRE effect which induces
enhanced attention to out-group faces, leading to significantly
greater pupillary dilation in males toward baby than adult faces
for out-groups.
While gender difference in regard to the Baby Schema
effect is well-established (Hess and Polt, 1960; Glocker et al.,

activity, this shows that males exhibit more activation and
thus attention toward out-group faces, which suggests the
presence of MRE and supports hypothesis 2. We conducted
another analysis by stratifying participants based on their ingroup Baby Schema effect (INBSE) score, from which we found
that participants lower in INBSE showed significantly different
activation patterns between Chinese and Caucasian baby faces,
whereas participants higher in INBSE did not. Instead, those
with a higher INBSE score exhibited distinct activation between
Chinese and Caucasian adult faces, which indicates that those
with higher INBSE differentiated between in-group and outgroup adults at the early stage of face processing. These findings
suggest that level of INBSE moderates MRE for adult and baby
faces, which supports hypothesis 3.
Questionnaire responses from participants, which was an
explicit measure of self-reported preference of faces, were
consistent in both Study 1 and 2. Males and females reported
greater preference for in-group adult faces, which suggests an
MRE specific to adult faces. Participants in Study 2 showed
greater preference for baby over adult faces which reflects an
overt BS effect. However, gender was not found to moderate
preferences for baby faces as expected in hypothesis 4.

4.1. Gender Moderates Baby Schema and
Mere Exposure Effects
Overall, we found in females a greater pupillary response
toward children than adults. However, looking specifically at
the direction of the variations, we observed that this response
goes in two different directions: a pupil dilation toward outgroup infants and a pupil constriction toward in-group ones.
Regarding pupil dilation, past studies (Glocker et al., 2009a,b),
where variables such as in-group and out-group were not
taken into account and where the physiological measure was
for example the neural response, highlighted that women
generally showed greater responses toward infants. Therefore,
it is possible to assume that the dilation that we observed in

Explicit and Implicit Face Processing

Higher BS scores were associated with reduced alpha
amplitudes (increase in neural activation) in response to outgroup adult than in-group adult faces. This suggests that a
strong BS effect, in which no difference is detected in the
processing of in-group and out-group infants is potentially
indicative of substantial MRE effects among adults (Proverbio
et al., 2011; Proverbio and De Gabriele, 2017). It is reasonable
to assume that participants who are more interested in
caregiving activities are also more sensitive to potentially
threatening stimuli to infants, such as unfamiliar out-group
adults (Lorenz, 1943; Lorenz and Martin, 1971; Glocker et al.,
2009a,b).

2009a), we found that gender also moderates MRE. Males
in Study 2 exhibited amplitude reduction of the alpha band,
corresponding to neural activation, in the left posterior-parietal
region toward unfamiliar out-group (Chinese) adult faces when
contrasted against familiar in-group (Caucasian) adult faces.
From an evolutionary point of view, better processing of new and
potentially threatening stimuli in the environment (out-group
faces) is pivotal and may guarantee the individual’s survival.
Amplitude decrease of alpha indicates a state of relatively
high excitability and engagement of the brain area, while an
amplitude increase reflects inhibition (Hart et al., 2000; Ito
and Urland, 2005; He et al., 2009). Posterior parietal areas are
involved in attentional processing (Buschman and Miller, 2007)
and activity in the alpha system may predict attention toward
threatening social stimuli (Yamakawa et al., 2009; Giardina
et al., 2012; Grimshaw et al., 2014). We might deduce therefore
that males attention is more effectively captured by out-group
adults, possibly due to evolutionary-enhanced processing which
occurs in response to unfamiliar stimuli that may pose a threat.
Behavioral reports from Study 1 and 2 showed greater preference
toward in-group adult faces, suggesting that MRE is present
at an explicit level in both males and females (Allport et al.,
1954; LeVine and Campbell, 1972; Brewer, 1979; Esposito et al.,
2014).
Attitudes toward infant and adult faces varied across the
two studies. Participants in Study 1 showed no difference in
attitude toward infant and adult faces, but both male and
female participants in Study 2 reported more positive attitudes
to infant faces compared to adult faces. These reports show
the existence of conscious perception of the BS effect (Glocker
et al., 2009a,b; Parsons et al., 2011). However, we did not find
any difference in reports of preference for infant compared
to adult faces between male and female participants as we
initially hypothesized.

4.3. Limitations
Here we report some limitations and propose possible future
directions of research. First, the main limitation of the present
work concerns the absence in the available literature of a
unequivocal interpretation of the pupil constriction toward ingroup baby faces observed in the pupillometry study. However,
this result is in line with (Landi and Freiwald, 2017) who found
that familiar faces elicit greater pupillary constrictions compared
to unfamiliar ones. The simultaneous presence of MRE and
the BS might explain why in females more attention is given
to infants than adults but with opposite direction depending
on the familiarity (Caucasian vs. Chinese). To confirm this
interpretation, however, a future study should try to test the
same paradigm in a different population where Chinese faces are
more familiar than Caucasian faces. Second, this study utilized
neutral faces only, and future studies should assess the effect
of emotional valence in facial expressions (i.e., smiling, crying).
Third, consistent with other studies (e.g., Esposito et al., 2015),
only two ethnic groups were examined. Employing a range of
different ethnic groups (e.g., African, Latin Americans, et al.)
could better expose relations between social distance from outgroups and face processing. Fourth, only adult female faces were
used; it has been well-established that males and females react
differently to faces of adult women. This gender bias could be
overcome by including adult male faces in the stimuli. Fifth,
future studies may combine frequency bands analysis (neural
oscillations) of face processing with other existing measures
of EEG, like Event Related Potential (ERP). ERP analysis was
not conducted in this study as it would have required multiple
repetitions of each stimulus that would not have enabled us to
be consistent with the pupillometry study. Sixth, despite the fact
that we analyzed data collected from a generally individualistic
society, it may be also interesting to replicate this study in
an more collectivist society to see how culture shapes faces
perception. Finally, future investigators should also consider
individually held attitudes and experiences with infants as well
as out-group members.

4.2. Baby Schema Moderates Mere
Exposure Effect
Individuals who experience the BS effect have been found
to possess higher levels of empathy, interpersonal closeness,
and need to belong (Lehmann et al., 2013). These personality
traits might also influence implicit perceptions toward ingroup and out-group faces. To investigate this relation, we
stratified our participants according to their Baby Schema
score. We found that participants with lower BS scores
differed in their processing of in-group and out-group
infant faces which fulfilled our third hypothesis. A possible
interpretation is that participants with lower BS scores are
less susceptible to the BS effect such that they discriminate
between in-group and out-group infants. Participants with
higher BS scores are generally more prone to find infant
faces appealing and are less likely to process in-group and
out-group infant faces differently. Similar neural processing of
infant faces of different ethnicity also suggests some protective
effect of BS when perceiving unfamiliar out-group infants
(Proverbio and De Gabriele, 2017).

5. CONCLUSION
The human face contains tremendous social information and
plays a fundamental role in communication with other people.
Our study has revealed the rich interplay of Baby Schema
(BS) and Mere Exposure (MRE) effects that emerge on merely

ETHICS STATEMENT

viewing adult and infant faces. We showed that gender greatly
moderates the processing of faces. Given the simultaneous
presence of both MRE and BS, females pay more attention
to infant than adult faces but the responses are opposite
for Caucasian and Chinese faces (constriction vs. dilation)
due to the familiarity of the stimuli. By comparison, males
attend to out-group infants significantly more than out-group
adults, but require more cognitive recruitment to process outgroup than in-group adult faces. While gender differences were
observed at the implicit processing level, males and females
did not differ in their self-reported attitudes, as both reported
greater preference for infant over adult faces. Contradictory
results that emerge at the implicit (physiological) and explicit
(self-report) levels indicate that differential processing of faces
varying in age and ethnicity may occur at a non-conscious
level. Besides gender, level of Baby Schema effect may reflect
empathy and predict differential processing of adult and infant
faces belonging to an individual’s in-group or out-group. These
findings evoke excitement regarding the role of gender and
personality in moderating face processing. Ingrained in us
is a complex biological attentional mechanism that extracts
critical information from the humble face and elicits automatic
responses that have been shaped by evolution and society.
