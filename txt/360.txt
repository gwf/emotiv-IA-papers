PHASE FLUCTUATION ANALYSIS IN FUNCTIONAL
BRAIN NETWORKS OF SCALING EEG
FOR DRIVER FATIGUE DETECTION
ABSTRACT
The characterization of complex patterns arising
from electroencephalogram (EEG) is an important problem with significant applications in identifying different
mental states. Based on the operational EEG of drivers,
a method is proposed to characterize and distinguish different EEG patterns. The EEG measurements from seven
professional taxi drivers were collected under different
states. The phase characterization method was used to
calculate the instantaneous phase from the EEG measurements. Then, the optimization of drivers’ EEG was
realized through performing common spatial pattern
analysis. The structures and scaling components of the
brain networks from optimized EEG measurements are
sensitive to the EEG patterns. The effectiveness of the
method is demonstrated, and its applicability is articulated.

1. INTRODUCTION
Electroencephalogram (EEG) is capable of direct
measurement of brain activity [1-3]. The information
from EEG is one of the most predictive and reliable
indicators for evaluating human cognition and the
study of human state discrimination [4, 5]. Unfortunately, EEG recordings are generated from the cortex
and collected from the scalp. In EEG measurements
there always appear complex and non-linear characteristics [6-10]. Understanding the non-linear and

complex dynamics underlying EEG measurements
is a significant and challenging problem [11]. In this
regard, a primary task is to characterize and quantify
different EEG patterns without the influence of the
non-linear and complex dynamics underlying EEG.
Generally speaking, a common practice is to examine
the phase fluctuation properties containing all relevant or discriminatory information needed to solve
the state discrimination problem. Driving is a cognitively effortful task requiring a mental capacity of
organizing and processing a great deal of information
simultaneously [12-14]. The driver’s state is reported
as one of the principal factors in driving safety [15].
For taxi drivers or long-haul bus drivers, fatigue reduces their ability to operate vehicles safely and reduces their situation alertness [16]. Therefore, characterizing EEG patterns to infer brain intentions and
brain states is important and has wide applications.
The purpose of this paper is to introduce an instantaneous phase-based method to characterize typical patterns from experimental EEG measurements.
Our idea is that the phase fluctuations associated
with time series are caused by the intrinsic dynamics and can therefore yield important information
about the underlying differences that the existing,
non-phase-based methods are incapable of revealing.
In particular, given a set of experimental EEG measurements, we first use the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method pioneered by Huang et al.
[17] to extract the phase fluctuations. To uncover any
robust scaling behaviour hidden in the phase fluctuations, the scaling analysis by brain networks of EEG

measurements is used. Our main finding is that the
relationship between the structure and the function
is an integration problem. And for each of two distinct patterns arising typically in the driving state
EEG measurements, a scaling exponent can be extrapolated from the phase fluctuations. For different
EEG patterns, the degree distributions are distinct,
indicating the effectiveness of the combined EMD
and functional brain network method to characterize and distinguish complex EEG patterns.

means the driver is in the taxi with his eyes closed.
After relaxing another three minutes the data were
recorded, which is regarded as post-relax. The experiment protocol is given in Figure 1.
The Emotiv EEG recorder was used for recording
these EEGs in both fatigue and post-relax situations.
The location of electrodes in the International 10-20
System of Emotiv is shown in Figure 1. The channels
used were AF3, F7, F3, FC5, P7, O1, O2, P8, FC6,
F4, F8, and AF4. The sample rate was 128 Hz.

ACQUISITION FOR DRIVERS’ EEG
MEASUREMENTS

3. PHASE CHARACTERIZATION OF
EEG MEASUREMENTS

Seven professional taxi drivers (male, ages 3040) were recruited on their voluntary basis in this
study. The time of the experiment was settled at
approximately 3 p.m. The taxi drivers should have
already worked for more than 5 hours during that
experiment day. The participants were asked to stop
driving to cooperate with the EEG signal collection.
After the experiment, they received a certain compensation for participating. The drivers admitted
that they were in fatigue condition after long-time
driving, so the first recorded data which lasted for
three minutes should be labelled as fatigue, then
ten minutes were given to the drivers to rest. “Rest”

To see the phase characterization of EEG measurements, analytic signal y(t) can be constructed
from the EEG data sequence x(t) by the Hilbert
transform,

where P indicates the Cauchy principal value for integral; A(t) represents the instantaneous amplitude,
and φ(t) represents the instantaneous phase.

shown in Figure 2a, due to multiple centres of rotation in the original signal, a properly defined phase
variable cannot be obtained from the analytic signal.
A proper phase can be defined based on the following two conditions in its complex plane [18, 19]:
(1) there is a preferred direction of rotation; and (2)
the rotation can be defined with respect to a unique
centre. The final proper phase can be obtained from
the complex conjugate pair.
However, the signal collected in real condition is
always too complicated to satisfy these two conditions. Thus, it is necessary to decompose the original signal into a number of modes whose analytic
signals correspond to proper rotations with the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method. EMD
method can decompose signal x(t) into a finite sum
of Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF), which is to identify the innate undulations belonging to different
time scales and sift them out to obtain one intrinsic
mode at a time [16, 17]. When the sifting process is
stopped, the signal is shown as,
n

/ c j ^ t h + rn ^ t h

(2)

j=1

where the intrinsic modes cj(t) are nearly orthogonal to each other, and residue rn(t) is a monotonic
function. By using the Hilbert transformation, each
mode cj(t) generates a proper rotation in the complex plane of its analytic signal,

The phase function of different intrinsic mode
functions and time-frequency domain description
for EEG measurements, has been analysed. The results can be seen in Figure 2. In this three-by-four
figure matrix, the first row shows time-domain
description of the original signal and its principal
IMFs. The second row shows the original signal and
its IMFs Trajectory in the complex plane. The third
row of this figure matrix gives the frequency-time
distribution for the corresponding signals in the first
column. The fact is obtained that although the original EEG measurements are complex, its phase consists of only a small number of non-trivial proper
rotations.
The frequency distribution of the second IMF is
within the proper frequency range of beta band (1330 Hz) of EEG signal; the third IMF is of 8-13 Hz
within the frequency range of alpha-band; the other
IMFs with lower and narrower frequency distribution

contain low-frequency noise reasoning from breath
and body movement. Therefore, the third IMF is chosen as alpha band for the following analysis.

4. SCALING ANALYSIS BY BRAIN
NETWORKS FOR DRIVING TASKS
The adjacent matrix is obtained by computing
the magnitude squared coherence between signals
from two different channels [20, 21]. The magnitude squared coherence Cxy is a function of the
power spectral densities Pxx(f) and Pyy(f) of x and y
[7, 22], and the cross power spectral density Pxy(f)
of x and y,
C xy ^ f h =

Pxy ^ f h
Pxx ^ f h Pyy ^ f h
2

(5)

Therefore, by using Equation 5, the adjacent matrix can be computed, as shown in Figure 3. The brain
networks under different states have different structural information as the connectivity between different pairs of nodes [22]. In order to give a flavour
about the distribution of spatial patterns, Figure 3
provides the weighted functional brain network, in
which the spatial topographic distribution obtained
a noticeable difference to driver’s different states.
The fluctuations associated with different driver
states can be reflected in the network organization,
as shown in Figure 3. The subfigures in the upper
line of Figures 3a-3d are configured by EEG measurements from the states after long-time driving,
and the driver can feel fatigued clearly in this regard. And the subfigures in the lower line of Figures
3e-3h are configured by EEG measurements from the
states after rest, and the driver fatigue is relieved
a lot in this state. From Figure 3, the distinct driver
states can be reflected in weighted brain networks
(Figures 3b and 3f) and node degree distributions (Figures 3c and 3g). When the driver fatigue relieves after
rest, the weighted brain network is composed of a
set of highly connected nodes, and this can be considered as an atlas of connectivity. The brain network under fatigue state has a structure with lower
connectivity between different pairs of nodes. The
node degree distributions are used to quantify the
structural connectivity quantification between two
distinct driver states.
The degree distribution P(k) of a network is defined to be the fraction of nodes in the network with
degree k [23-25]. If there are N nodes in total in a
network and nk of them have degree k, the degree
distribution can be given by:
490

n
P ^ k h = Nk

(6)

The two subfigures in the last column of Figures
3d and 3h show that the node degree with the highest
occurrence rate is seven for driver state after longtime driving, and the node degree with the highest
occurrence rate is eleven for driver state after rest,
which is marked with “*” in Figure 3. The nodes degree distribution increase during the fatigue level
variation, the probability distribution of nodes degree moves from smaller degree values to larger
degree values. Because the nodes degree represents
the number of connectivity belonging to the nodes,
the connectivity of the whole weighted brain network increases when the driver recovered from fatigue by some time rest.

5. DISCUSSION
The scaling analysis results are shown here for
other participants of the driving tasks by functional brain network to explore the consistence among
other participants. From the adjacent matrix to the
weighted brain networks, the analysis results of the
driving task for the other six participants can be illustrated in Figure 4. For most of these six participants, the connectivity of brain networks increases
as the driver fatigue relieves after rest. The brain
network under fatigue state has a structure with
lower connectivity between different pairs of nodes.
The node degree distributions are used to quantify
the structural connectivity quantification between
two distinct driver states, as illustrated in Figure 5.
From Figure 5, the distinct driver states can be reflected in node degree distributions clearly.
The subfigures with horizontal bars in Figure 5
show the node degree with the highest occurrence
rate marked with “*”. In this six-by-four figure matrix, subfigures in each row are for the same driver,
the subfigures in the first two columns are for the
driver state just after long-time driving, the last two
columns represent the node degree distributions for
the state after rest. During this fatigue level variation, the nodes degree distribution increases for most
participants; the probability distribution of nodes
degree moves from smaller degree values to larger
degree values as illustrated in Figure 5. Because the
nodes degree represents the number of connectivity belonging to the nodes, the connectivity of the
whole weighted brain network increases when the
driver recovers from fatigue by some time rest.

The variation of degree distribution can be obtained from Figure 6 for all these seven drivers by bar
plot of the average value of node degrees with an
error bar. This variation trend can be found in most
drivers, except drivers E and F; they may have had
not enough rest for this experiment. However, the
average degree value increases for the other drivers.
This means that the number of functional connectivity increases as well.

The current study explored the whole-brain
functional connectivity of the driving fatigue tasks
based on an instantaneous phase-based method.
Our idea was inspired by previous studies [15,
26], which suggests that the phase fluctuations of
non-linear signals such as EEG measurements are
sensitive to changes in human cognition behaviours.
These phase fluctuations associated with time series
are caused by the intrinsic dynamics and can therefore yield important information about the underlying information that the existing, non-phase-based
methods are incapable of revealing. These are validated by the discriminant of different states in human cognition-related tasks: driving fatigue.
To uncover any robust behaviour hidden in the
phase fluctuations, the weighted brain networks of
EEG measurements processed by EMD were used.
EMD as a processing method is widely used in reducing artefact involving EEG measurements. Distinguishing from the conventional EMD-based analysis, the novelty of this work is that the EMD method
is used as an instantaneous phase-based method to
obtain robust behaviour of phase fluctuations for
Promet – Traffic & Transportation, Vol. 32, 2020, No. 4, 487-495

classifying distinct EEG patterns. The other novelty
of this work lies in the fact that the graph theory was
employed to gain more understanding of the reorganization of brain networks under different cognitive
states: mental fatigue/relax. The weighted brain networks show significant differences under different
states among the participants in both cognitive tasks
as discussed above.
In the driving task, the current finding of increased functional connectivity among the entire
brain when the driver states varied from fatigue to
resting, suggests when the driver is in the fatigue
state, and the dysfunctional interactions among
different brain regions that may lead to deficits in
cognitive processes that rely on such connectivity.
After prolonged driving, induced mental fatigue can
impair the cognitive skills. This consistent phenomenon has been reported previously. Therefore, the
relationship between structure and function is an
integration problem. And for each of two distinct
patterns arising typically in the driving state EEG
measurements, a scaling exponent can be extrapolated from the phase fluctuations.
It was investigated further how the brain functional network topology property was associated
with the cognition process as the driving fatigue.
The brain network related to the driving tasks exhibited lower node degree distribution than this
property after rest. We found that the node degree
distribution of the best bands combination of the
EEG had network property that was significantly
higher during the mental fatigue state than the rest
state. For different EEG patterns, the degree distributions are distinct, indicating the effectiveness of
the combined EMD and functional brain network
method to characterize and distinguish the complex
EEG patterns.

6. CONCLUSION
The message from the current research on driving tasks is that the phase fluctuation information
can help reveal the brain state involving the weighted brain network. Despite task changes in our experiments, the node distribution of different participants’ brains can reveal distinct brain states. For
the driver fatigue task, the nodes degree distribution increases for most participants, the probability distribution of node degree moves from smaller
degree values to larger degree values when recovering from fatigue. Therefore, the brain network
under fatigue has low node degree distribution.

Fatigue-related neural specificity or dedifferentiation resulting from fatigue may lead to fatigue-related declines in the modularity of brain-wide network
organization. Increased within-network connectivity may reflect recovering from fatigue. Because of
its involvement in a wide range of functional networks underpinning different cognitive processes,
further research is needed to understand the complex relations between changes in the network organization and performance and to determine whether
the functions discussed in this paper extend more
widely to other components of the brain.

位波动分析

[12]

摘要：

[13]

脑电复杂模式的表征是识别在重要应用领域中
不同心理状态的重要问题。本文基于驾驶员脑电提
出了一种方法来表征和区分不同的脑电模式。采集
了七名职业出租车司机在不同状态下的脑电。利用
相位特征法计算脑电信号的瞬时相位，通过共空间
模式算法对驾驶员的脑电信号进行分析，实现脑电
信号的优化。由优化后的脑电得到的脑网络结构和
尺度分量对脑电模式敏感，证明了所提方法的有效
性，并阐明了其适用性。
