Abstract
The classification of motor imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) is a pivotal part of the biosignal classification in the brain-computer interface (BCI)
applications. Currently, this bio-engineering based technology is being employed
by researchers in various fields to develop cutting edge applications. The classification of real-time MI-EEG signal is the core computing and challenging task
in these applications. It is well-known that the existing classification methods
are not so accurate due to the high dimensionality and dynamic behaviors of
the real-time EEG data. To improve the classification performance of real-time
BCI applications, this paper presents a clustering-based ensemble technique and
a developed brain game that distinguishes different human thoughts. At first,
we have gathered the brain signals, extracted and selected informative features
from these signals to generate training and testing sets. After that, we have
constructed several classifiers using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support
Vector Machine (SVM), naı̈ve Bayes, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest, Bagging, AdaBoost and compared the performance of these existing approaches
with suggested clustering-based ensemble technique. On average, the proposed
ensemble technique improved the classification accuracy of roughly 5 to 15%
compared to the existing methods. Finally, we have developed the targeted

1. Introduction
In this era, brain engineering is an emerging field of science and technology.
It includes the apprehension and accomplishment of various fields like physics,
chemistry, biology, computer science, and mathematics to base its application
5

[1]. On top of that, it incorporates the concepts and methods of varied fields like
biological science, clinical medicine as well as engineering [2]. Brain-Computer
Interface (BCI) is a branch of brain engineering that targets to solve practical
problems of the life sciences. BCI and Human Machine Interface (HMI) are the
modern technology that is used as a tool to establish communication between

10

users and machines [3]. BCI technology incorporates neurophysiological activities as input signals and then these signals interpret into meaningful commands
employing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to execute actions by an external system [4, 5]. BCI technology brings about a huge number of opportunities
in the medical field especially for the treatment and rehabilitation for disabled

15

people. Around the world, millions of people are affected by various forms of
disability and physical impairment caused by various reasons such as – born
disability, old-age disability, early-age disability, accidental/unforeseen issues,
serious health problems, and more [6]. For disabled people, it is extremely difficult or, in some cases, impossible to do day to day chores without the assistance

of any caregiver. A variety of equipment and devices invented in this field for

rehabilitating and aiding disabled people to cope with their physical deficiencies
[7]. This technology allows disabled people to command and control external devices such as – computers, wheelchairs, robots, etc., by utilizing their thoughts.
Notwithstanding, the horizon of this field has been broadened to a wide range of
25

non-medical applications like gaming, entertainment, military, and meditation
training [8, 9]. The knowledge of BCI can also be applied in smart environment
systems like smart houses or smart workplaces. This technology has opened a
new window of opportunities for the gaming and entertainment industry and
different types of games already being developed using this technology to relief

30

from stress [10, 11].
Fundamentally, BCI technology can be employed in three ways based on the
process of signal acquisition from brain [12]. One way is to place wires inside the
grey matter of the brain, this is called invasive BCI [13, 3]. Though invasive BCI
begets a better input signal, it is highly sophisticated and extremely sensitive

35

to implement [12, 14]. That is why it necessitates very proficient people to
manipulate with. Another way is to place electrodes on the surface of the scalp
to measure activities from a huge group of neurons. This method is called noninvasive BCI [15, 16]. In comparison with invasive BCI, it does not deliver better
input signals as good as [17]. But it is less sophisticated and easy to accomplish

40

with. The third type of BCI is called partially invasive BCI. In this technique,
wires are placed inside the brain but above the grey matter of it [12, 17].
Concerning motor imagery EEG signal classification, the proficiency of many
single and ensemble classifiers had previously been evaluated. Our prior studies
had assessed the performance of existing single and ensemble classifiers in real-

45

time BCI applications [17, 13, 18]. It is well-known that the existing classifiers
are not so accurate due to the high dimensionality and dynamic behaviors of the
real-time EEG data [19, 20]. Sometimes, the signals are biased with artifacts
and noise due to the low conductivity of the electrodes with the scalp [1]. The
objective of this paper is to extend our prior works and ameliorates the classifi-

50

cation performance by handling multiple electrodes/ neurons data at the same
time. The proposed clustering-based ensemble technique clustered the dataset

based on the position of the electrodes so that each cluster represents dissimilar
information. It also selects the model dynamically based on the electrode locations to classify real-time EEG data. We have constructed several classifiers
55

using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), naı̈ve
Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, AdaBoost and compared the
performance of these existing approaches with the suggested technique. We also
developed a brain game to distinguish human thoughts in real-time. We employed the threading technique to control the signal classification and prediction

60

tabulation via animated ball in real-time.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the
related works. Section 3 illustrates brain measurement techniques, signal acquisitions, and datasets descriptions. Section 4 reveals supervised classification
and the proposed clustering-based ensemble method. Section 5 provides experi-

65

mental results and introduces a brain game that is controlled by brain signals of
motor imagery tasks. Finally, Section 6 presents conclusions and future work.

2. Related Works
H. Raza et al. [1] presented an adaptive ensemble approach in EEG classification to handle non-stationarity in the motor imagery task; the proposed
70

approach collected MI correlated brain responses and extracted spatial pattern
structures from it, and new classifiers are added over time with an existing ensemble classifier to justify the deviations in streaming data input. Furthermore,
BCI-related EEG datasets are employed to evaluate the proposed approach with
single-classifier and it ameliorated the BCI performance significantly. S. Sreeja

75

et al. [14] proposed a sparse based classification method to classify MI related
tasks from EEG data. For enhancing the computational time, they only used
wavelet energy without any pre-processing as a feature to classify MI data. In
their experiments, the proposed sparsity approach outperformed existing classifiers in a minor computation time.

Averaging (OA) to interpret MI-EEG data. To overwhelm the constraint of the
general Region of Interest (ROI) based decrypting approach, they used Weighted
Minimum Norm Estimate (WMNE). They experimented on a public dataset
employing 10-fold cross-validation and achieved higher decrypting accuracy of
85

81.32% than existing approaches. S. Sun et al. [19] researched to methodically
assess the performance of popular ensemble methods: bagging, boosting and
random subspace to classify MI related tasks from EEG signals. They used
the base classifiers of SVM, DT, and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) to advocate
the possibilities of ensemble classification methods. Moreover, few significant

90

inferences were produced to reveals the performance of ensemble methods for
EEG classification in their study.
P. Pattnaik and J. Sarraf [21] attempted to apply left and right-hand movement classification using raw EEG signals. Before applying the movement classification, they had removed the artifacts in the obtained signals employing a

95

low pass filtering technique. Moreover, they kept a strong focus on the application of BCI as well as the issues related to it. K. Mamun et al. [18]
introduced a technique to procure frequency reliant neural synchronization as
well as inter-hemispheric connectivity properties. They based their method on
Granger causality as well as wavelet packet transform (WPT) approaches. Their

100

approach was capable of decoding movement associated behaviors accurately as
well as informatively, from the registered local field potentials (LFPs) activity.
Movement recognition accuracy was 99.8%, and afterward laterality recognition
was 81.5% on average. Finding of this study show that nominated optimum
neural synchronization associated with inter-hemispheric connectivity and has

Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) based BCI. They used the structures and classifiers that are computationally suitable for online application by

and received roughly 73% accuracy in their experiment. Later, methodical
feature selection approaches and three classifiers such as: naı̈ve Bayes, Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and SVM were compared. Combining the SVM
115

classifier with weighted sequential forward selection(WSFS), a topmost accuracy of 87.60±3.27% was acquired. M. M. Shanechi [23] examined the decoding
algorithms made in the BMI study. It is possible to design a motor BMI as a
closed-loop control system. They inspected current decoder designs that emphasize the unique properties of BMI. Moreover, a discussion was presented

120

about the existing opportunities to formulate a control-theoretic framework to
design BMI, as well as, assisting the development of more advanced BMI control
algorithms.
R. M. Mehmood et al. [24] proposed a method that considerably enhances
the rate of emotion recognition regarding the popularly implemented spec-

125

tral power band routine. Features selected by this routine performed better
than both univariate and multivariate attributes. The optimal attributes were
later processed to classify emotion by applying KNN, SVM, LDA, naı̈ve Bayes,
Random Forest, and deep learning classifiers. M. A. Lebedev and M. A.L.
Nicolelis[25] emphasized on some of the essential challenges encountered by BMI

130

research. Moreover, they proposed a chain of milestones to convert up to date
experimental advances into viable medical applications within the coming 10 20 years. The guideline they provided underscores the contemporary history
of the BMI and puts a strong emphasis on the influential factors related to its
growth.

3. EEG Signal Acquisition
3.1. Functional Areas of Brain
The human brain is the main organ of the human nervous system [18]. The
central nervous system has consisted of both the brain and spinal cord. The
human brain acts as the master of the whole body, as almost all of the body

140

activities are controlled by it. It has the functionalities of receiving, processing

and generating information for the well-being of human beings [26]. The sense
organs send informations to the brain. The brain then integrates, coordinates
and processes the given input informations to produce decisions and commands
to the rest of the body [21]. Different brain parts are responsible for completing
145

different tasks. Motor system is the part that both generates and controls the
movements of the body [18]. The nerves do the job of transferring the motor
system-generated movements from the brain to the motor neurons in the body.
The action of the muscle is governed by the passing movements. Using the
spinal cord, the corticospinal tract passes movements to the torso as well as

150

to the limbs. The eyes, mouth, and face related movements are carried by
the cranial nerve [25]. The motor cortex generates the movement of arms and
legs. The motor cortex consists of three parts- primary motor cortex, premotor
cortex, and supplementary motor area [22]. Locating on the frontal lobe of
the brain, the primary motor cortex is one of the essential brain areas that

155

are necessary for motor function. The primary motor cortex produces neural
impulses and then these impulses control the execution of movement [13].
3.2. Brain Measurement Techniques
In BCI, different kinds of neurological modalities are applied to obtain neurological brain signals [18]. Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the variety of

160

ways that are applied for measuring brain activities. It is usually a non-invasive
approach and assesses voltage oscillations ensuing from ionic current inside the
brain neurons [12]. Another non-invasive method for measuring brain activities includes positron emission tomography (PET), magneto-encephalography
(MEG), Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) as well as functional mag-

165

netic resonance imaging (fMRI) [9, 27]. Some of the invasive electrophysiological
methods are local field potentials (LFPs), electrocorticography (ECoG), as well
as single-unit recording. EEG, ECoG, LFPs as well as single-neuron recordings
are the only methods which are popular in use because of their relative simplicity
and inexpensiveness, and they also come with high temporal resolution [18, 28].

170

On the other hand, fMRI, MEG, and PET are very costly and not much usable;

which makes them unpopular to use [12]. In our experiment, we used Emotiv
EPOC+ EEG neuroheadset because it is less sophisticated, inexpensive, and
easy to use.
3.3. EEG Emotiv EPOC+ Neuroheadset
175

The Emotiv EPOC+ 14 channels is an EEG neuroheadset that ables to produce measurable electric potentials to assess brain activities [29]. It is equipped
with 14 saline sensors (electrodes) which are put on the scalp of the brain following the international 10-20 system. In the 10-20 system, the real distance among
two adjacent sensors can be either 10% or 20% [29]. The electrodes are situ-

two reference electrodes- Driven Right Lag (DRL) and Common Mode sense
(CMS) are located at P3 and P4 locations [29, 13, 17]. The electrodes distribution of emotiv epoc+ employing the 10-20 system is shown in Fig. 1.

procedures and gave informed consent before the experiment. Firstly, we developed an application program via implementing Java-based technology as well as
Emotiv SDK to obtain brain signals from Emotiv neuroheadset. Then, we ac190

quired an average band power of theta, alpha, low beta, high beta, and gamma
EEG neural frequency rhythms via the application program. EEG brainwaves,
ranges and their association with different activities in the brain are described
in section 3.5. We have mentioned earlier, the primary motor cortex produces
neural impulses that control the execution of movements. In our MI hand move-

195

ment experiment, we have selected F3 , F C5 , F C6 and F4 locations that are best
fitted in the primary motor cortex area of the brain. We had employed Emotiv
SDK API to acquire the average band power of these selected electrodes from
the newest epoch with 0.5 seconds step size and 2 seconds window size. The
average band power (BP) summarizes the overall power of the given frequency

200

band and is calculated for the filtered band between 4 to 45 Hz by each electrode.
We have recorded the MI-EEG brain signals for binary and ternary classes and
the class values are steady, left and right-hand. During the experiment, participants wore the headset and connected it to the developed program computer
through a wireless connection to the USB dongle. From each participant, we

205

have taken two trials to obtain a training set for 30 seconds and one trial to
acquire a testing set for 15 seconds. MI-EEG brain signal recording source code
is available via open repository at: https://github.com/mrzResearchArena/
MI-EEG/tree/master/Brain-Game/eeg_data_recording.
3.5. EEG Data Descriptions

210

The EEG measures different neural frequency rhythms that are associated
with different regions, pathologies or brain states. Neural frequency is assessed
by calculating the number of wave repeats within a second [12]. Table 1 illustrates the EEG brainwaves, ranges and their association with different activities
in the brain [12, 3]. Most of the brain oscillations are connected with motor and

215

sensory actions and associated with different brain functions. Brain oscillations
are identified via electrodes then distributed into different frequency rhythms

The motor imagery hand movement deviations are found very high in the
recorded MI-EEG responses as tabulated in Fig. 3. It represents that the
movement and steady can be effortlessly found from the MI-EEG responses.

It also highlighted that the movements of left and right-hand are challenging
to categorize. We already mentioned that the primary motor cortex produces
neural impulses to control the execution of movements. These movements are
engendered from the related area and produced similar patterns that generate
difficulty to classify patterns effortlessly.

4. Classification
In classification techniques, instance classification is accomplished via training and testing steps [32]. Training data points are used to build mining classifier, where all data points are labeled with class values. At the time of testing,
data points are classified employing mining classifier [33]. In this technique,

point xn ∈ D contains F features Af , f = 1, ..., F . Here, anf illustrates the
value of attribute Af of data point xn and each one belongs to a class of C
classes { c1 , ..., cl , ..., cM }. In this section, we will briefly describe the proposed
clustering-based ensemble model with four single classifiers and three ensemble
245

learning methods.
4.1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
An artificial neural network (ANN) is a brain-inspired classification system
based on the arrangement of biological neural networks [34]. It consists of
input, output layers and sometimes single or multiple hidden layers exist to find

250

complex patterns. To compute neuron input I, it uses bias weight θ, connected
all neurons weight W and output O [34]. After that, neuron input I manipulates
to calculate neuron output O employing different activation functions. Neuron
input I and output O calculated by employing non-linear sigmoid function, are
illustrated in Eq. 1 and 2 [24].

Ij =

The network contains several connections, each connection computes the
output of a neuron and then used by another neuron as input [24]. Weights
are allocated to each connection to reveal relative importance. Initially, all the
weights are assigned randomly. After that, each neuron learns from the set of
training instances D, computes the error according to the desired output of

260

D and adjusts the weights based on errors. The backpropagation algorithm is
employed updating weights to ameliorate the network until achieving the pure
output weight [34].

Eq. 3 is employed iteratively to adjust all the weights of the network. Here,
the learning rate, η expresses the proportion of corrective steps to adjust the
265

errors of the model in each iteration [34, 24].
4.2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised classifier that explores
training instances and discovers hyperplanes, or support vectors to maximize the
margin among the classes [35]. In two dimensional space, the support vectors

270

split a plane into two chunks through a line where each cluster denotes individual
classes [18]. A set of training data points, D= {x1 , ..., xN } having N number
of data points with class values C= {1, −1} is employed to train the classifier.
We can select two parallel support vectors with supreme probable distance to
separate classes. The maximum distance between two hyperplanes is called the

275

margin [18].

4.3. Naı̈ve Bayes Classifier (NB)
Naı̈ve Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning classifier based on
285

Bayes’ theorem. It engenders probability scanning the training instances only
ones and can handle the missing attribute values easily by omitting its probabilities [32]. It takes a dataset, D with F number of attributes as input to build
the classifier model. For testing a new instance, xnew , the classifier will calculate
the posterior probability and assign a class label with the highest probability.

P (Ci |X) =
290

P (X|Ci )P (Ci )
P (X)

(8)

In Eq. 8, Bayes theorem states mathematically as P (X) is constant for all
classes [32]. Here, P (X|Ci ) and P (Ci ) represents conditional and priori class
probability. For instance, NB classifier predicts a new data point, X as class
Ci , if P (X|Ci )P (Ci ) is greater than P (X|Cj )P (Cj ) [33].

For data point X, xf denotes to the value of feature Af . The probability

P (xf |Ci ) can be simply assessed from the training instances, if feature, Af
is categorical-valued. Otherwise, feature Af is continuous-valued, then Af is
estimated through a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation σ and mean

The CART uses Gini Index that engenders binary classification tree to make
decisions [32]. Firstly, it assesses the adulteration of dataset, D where probability Pn is estimated through |cl , D|/|D| reveals in Eq. 11 [33]. Here, the sum
is calculated over C classes and each instance, xn ∈ D belongs to a class cl .

It splits the dataset, D considering binary split and the weighted sum of the
305

adulteration of every resulting sub-data. For instance, the dataset, D splits into
D1 and D2 considering the Gini Index of D which is calculated in given Eq. 12
[36].

For each attribute, Af considers each probable sub-data and nominated as
the splitting attribute which ameliorate the reduction impurity, shown in Eq.

According to the attribute Gini Index impurity, it will split the dataset
and create leaf nodes until all the splitting data belongs to an equivalent class.

4.5. Random Forest
315

Random forest is an ensemble approach to classify a high volume of data with
superior accuracy [38]. Initially, it splits a set of instances, D into numerous
subsets D1 , D2 , ..., Dn depending on the number of features F . Then, it
constructs multiple decision trees based on the number of subsets and returns
the most popular class among the trees as prediction [38, 19]. The learning

320

scheme of random forest is tabulated in Algorithm 1. There is an association
between the accuracy and number of engendered trees, the number of trees is
directly proportional to accuracy. In machine learning, overfitting is one of the
crucial problems and it may abate the classifier accuracy [38]. Random Forest
classifier has overcome this difficulty. As it considers the vote of generated

325

every decision trees, it will not overfit the model and gain greater accuracy than
a single classifier model [38, 1].
4.6. Bagging
Bagging is also called Bootstrap Aggregation, which is an ensemble approach
employed in statistical classification and regression to boost the performance of

330

ML algorithms [1]. It combines the prediction of different equal-weighted models
and classifies a new instance using the voting technique[19]. In the bagging
technique, it requires a set of instances, D of size N , number of iterations, I
to build the classifier model. It generates new datasets, {D1 , D2 , ..., Dn } by
sampling the original dataset, D with replacement until the iterations number,

335

I. Then, it uses each sub-datasets and learning scheme illustrated in Algorithm
1 to derive classifier models. To classify a new instance, xnew , it combines the
output of each model and considers the majority voting as prediction [19, 1, 39].
4.7. AdaBoost
Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) is a popular ML meta-algorithm, which com-

340

bines a series of classifiers weighted votes to classify identified or unidentified
instances [1]. It emphases on noisy data and builds a strong classifier by combining a set of weak classifiers [40]. Initially, it assigns an equal weight, 1/d

to each training data point, xi ∈ D. Then, it engenders a group of datasets,
{D1 , D2 , ..., Dn } by sampling D with replacement based on instance weight un345

til the iterations number, I. Each generated dataset, Di derives a model, Mi
and computes the error of the model by adding the weights of all instances in
Di . Eq. 14 is shown the error calculation function of a model where err(xj )
will be 1 when xj will misclassified, otherwise 0 [41, 42].

error(Mi ) =

d
X

wj ∗ err(xj )

(14)

j=1

If the error of a model exceeds 0.5, we will regenerate Di and derive a new
350

Mi . We will update the weight of an instance as if the weight of classified
instances is abated and misclassified instances are enlarged [37]. To classify a
new instance, it combines the votes and weights of each classifier.
4.8. Proposed Ensemble Method
The ensemble method is a technique to construct a powerful model by in-

355

corporating numerous classifiers. It considers several classifiers prediction to
acquire state-of-the-art performance. In this section, we will discuss the proposed clustering-based ensemble technique that is used to classify motor imagery
hand movement tasks. Initially, the proposed method takes the training EEG
brain data D= {x1 , ..., xN } from N E neurons, or electrodes. Then, we have

360

clustered the dataset, D into N E clusters based on the position of the electrodes. All clustered datasets D1 , D2 , ..., DN E represent diverse electrodes and
labeled with previous class values. We also clustered the attributes of every sub
dataset, Dn , into C clusters. After getting sub dataset, we have construct m
number of decision trees D1 , .., DTm with mth cluster attributes employing de-

365

cision tree induction algorithm (CART). The working procedures of the CART
algorithm reveals comprehensively in section 4.4. We compute the error rate
of DT1 , DT2 , ..., DTm on dataset, Dn and consider the minimum error rate as
threshold, T . Then, we have considered the decision tree, DTm with minimal
error rate for ensemble trees DT ∗ . Finally, we predict each real-time EEG data

point, xnew employing DT ∗ based on the position of the electrodes and deliberate the majority vote as prediction among the predictions of DTn ∈ DT ∗ .
The data points are coming from dissimilar electrodes and select the model dynamically based on the position of the electrodes. The process of classifying
motor imagery tasks is illustrated in Fig.4 and the proposed clustering-based

375

ensemble method is summarized in Algorithm 2. Space and time complexity of
the proposed method depends on the number of features, dimensions of training
data and size of the engendered tree.

In BCI, real-time MI related EEG signal classification is a challenging task.
Sometimes, the signals are biased with artifacts and noise due to the low con380

ductivity of the electrodes with the scalp [1]. Different areas of the brain are
responsible for the individual task and each electrode on the scalp provides dissimilar signals [19]. To ameliorate the performance of EEG signal classification
in real-time is a demanding job because of the high dimensionality of the data
and dynamic behavior of the electrodes [40]. If the training set is high dimen-

385

sional, it will be challenging to build a good model employing single classifiers
like ANN, SVM, naı̈ve Bayes, and Decision Tree [19, 20]. Ensemble learning
methodologies have been employed widely to grab these challenges. But existing ensemble methods generate sub-datasets by sampling the original dataset
with replacement technique [1]. By applying this technique, the same instance

390

can be repeated several times. The proposed clustering-based ensemble technique is to overcome these problems and classifies MI related EEG signals in
real-time. It clustered the dataset based on the position of the electrodes so
that each cluster represents dissimilar information. It also selects the model
dynamically based on the electrode locations to classify real-time EEG data.

5. Experiments
In this section, we will describe the experimental environments, results of
the proposed clustering-based ensemble method and present the developed brain
game that is controlled by real-time motor imagery hand movements data.
5.1. Experimental Setup

400

In this study, the experiments were conducted via a device with an Intel
Core-i5 (2.60 GHz) processor, and 8 GB of RAM. We implement the proposed
method in Python programming language (version 3.7) and used the scikit-learn
(version 0.21.2) as a machine learning library. We have tested the performance
of the proposed method with some popular machine learning algorithms using

405

classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score. The accuracy is measured

by Eq. 15 where assess(xi ) = 1 when xi is correctly classified or assess(xi ) = 0
when xi is misclassified [32, 36]. The weighted average values of precision,
recall, and F-score are considered and the calculations are shown in Eq. 16
to 18 [36, 37]. We also represent decision boundaries using the area under the
410

ROC curve and AUC score. In the ROC curve, true positive rate (TPR) is
plotted against false positive rate (FPR) and the calculations are defined in Eq.
19 and 20 [13]. The lowest threshold is considered through a line, y = x in auROC curve where correctly classified data points represent 1 and misclassified
instances reveal as 0 [38].

tested the classifiers model using Python Scikit-learn machine learning libraries
supplying each of the testing EEG data.
The results in Table 3 point out that the proposed clustering-based ensemble
425

algorithm outperforms the existing classifiers on a binary-class motor imagery
EEG dataset. The proposed method performed superior and reached 99% accuracy on average for binary-class dataset. In this dataset, single classifiers are
failed to achieve more than 85% accuracy where existing ensemble approaches
can achieve 91% accuracy. The decision boundaries of the proposed method

with some existing classifiers for this dataset is shown in Fig. 6.

Moreover, in Table 4, the proposed clustering-based ensemble classifier also
outperforms some popular machine learning algorithms on ternary-class dataset.
In the ternary-class dataset, left and right-hand movements classification were
challenging because both tasks are engendered from the motor cortex and sam435

ples are associated. This time our proposed method achieved better than the
existing four single classifiers and three ensemble methods. Fig. 5 illustrates
the decision boundaries of the classifiers via ROC analysis and AUC scores for
the ternary-class dataset.
Besides, we used the EEG eye state dataset to experience our proposed

440

clustering-based ensemble method. For this dataset, we have also significant
upgrading of our proposed algorithm and achieved 90% accuracy on average.

20% accuracy parallel to single classifiers. It also ameliorated the classification
accuracy of approximately 5 to 15% compared to existing ensemble approaches.
Although the proposed clustering-based ensemble method outperforms other
existing classifiers, there are limitations to be considered. Sometimes, the input
signal is influenced by artifacts and noise due to the short conductivity of the

455

neurons with the scalp. For these reasons, the classifier failed to correctly classify

5.3. Developing Brain Game
We used our proposed clustering-based ensemble model and Java-Swing technology to develop our targeted application (game) system. We also used the
460

emotiv community SDK in our Java program to acquire live brain signals. This
game takes average band power of different frequency bands from F3 , F C5 , F C6
and F4 electrodes as input commands. Then these commands are classified by
the proposed model based on the position of the electrodes and provide some
actions as prediction. The input commands are coming from F3 , F C5 , F C6 ,

465

F4 electrodes and select the model dynamically based on the position of the
electrodes. We have exposed some actions via animated balls according to the
predictions and percentage of different classified class. The real brain data classification through the developed model and prediction tabulation via animated
balls in real-time is controlled via threads. The final prediction is taken from

the dynamic number of instances votes to control the game more precisely. We
have developed two versions of this game and they can identify binary as well

rehabilitation as well as upgrading of user well-being. The user can exercise his

In our research, we have used Emotiv Epoc+ EEG neuroheadset after analyzing several BMI devices like Emotiv Epoc+, Muse Headband, Aurora Dream,
and MindWave. To obtain MI-EEG brain signals, we built an application pro485

several classifiers using ANN, SVM, naı̈ve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest,

with the proposed clustering-based ensemble technique. The ensemble method
we suggested, produced better performance than the above-mentioned classi490

fiers. Then, the suggested method was used to develop the aimed application
system. The game that we developed is capable of controlling the movements
of the balls utilizing the real-time MI-EEG brain signals. It offers the user to
enhance the quality of attention, which boosts productivity as well as upgrades
the standard of works. It also assists people who are physically impaired or

495

disabled and carries the potentials for human functionality enhancement. We
designed the game to be a single-player game and to recognize three actions.
In the future, more actions and more players can be added to make the game
more advanced and challenging. The finding of this research can be applied to
manipulate and enhance the control as well as movements of robots. It also

500

brings new potentials in the health and rehabilitation industry.
