Abstract. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) has received a huge interest as a direct communication pathway
between a human brain and an external device. BCI is very useful in many areas of research. This study
examines and discusses the feasibility and usability of the Emotiv Epoc+ noninvasive device. The focus is on
the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) signals associated with visual and auditory senses. To measure
signals the free version of software Emotiv Xavier ControlPanel is used. The results depict that the Emotiv
Epoc+ device is a suitable option in BCI for scientific and entertainment purposes.

1 Introduction
Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) creates a direct
communication between the brain and an external device.
Real-time interaction with the brain using BCI
technologies is opening new, important, and potentially
highly impactful possibilities for improving the lives of
people. BCI research has shown enormous potential in a
wide range of applications. Possible examples for the
application of BCI devices include the restoration of
communication function for people suffering ALS,
treatment of movement disorders, detection and
suppression of epileptic seizures, rehabilitation of chronic
stroke survivors, or treatment of people with severe
chronic pain. The substantial improvement of BCI
research is documented by the large and growing
academic researchers in this area. Research and studies
provided ample evidence that signals recorded invasively
or noninvasively from the brain can be used to give
information about the motor, sensory, cognitive, or
affective state of a user. That information can be decoded
from the brain in real time, and the results of this decoding
can produce stimulation of the nervous system (to replace,
restore, enhance, supplement, or improve human
functions). [1]
BCI device is used especially to help disabled people.
However, these research approaches also aim at
applications that are not necessarily in the clinical field.
Many BCI applications currently exist. Emerging areas
are medicine, communication and control, rehabilitation,
assistive technology, entertainment, training, security,
psychology, etc. [2]
BCI systems consist of several sequential steps, which
can be categorized into four groups. It is about a brain
activity pattern generation, signal acquisition, feature
*

extraction, and classification. The appropriate technique
should be chosen according to the type of brain activity
and the purpose of the measurement. There are many
types of BCI. The most common is the division into
invasive and noninvasive systems. Another way to
categorize BCIs is through their Operation Strategy, in
which the BCI elicits brain signals during use. The BCI
that utilizes selective attention presents users with
auditory, visual, or tactile stimulation to elicit brain signal
responses. [3] Many classes of electrophysiological
activities of the brain are used in designing various types
of BCIs. Sensorimotor activity corresponds to the
behavior of the brain rhythms (mu, beta, and gamma),
movement-related potentials and other. [4]
The usability and feasibility are an indispensable part
of BCI systems. In this article, brain signals were
measured using Emotiv Epoc+ device. Emotiv is one of
the BCI technology for public users. To measure brain
activity using Emotiv devices noninvasive BCIs based on
EEG recordings is used. In which the electrodes are
placed on the surface of the skull. To examine brain
activity, the record of spontaneous brain activity of visual
and auditory stimuli is used. Various electrodes in the
Emotiv Epoc+ mobile wireless neuroheadset provide the
data. To measure signal quality is used Emotiv Xavier
ControlPanel software.

Emotiv Epoc+ is designed for scalable and contextual
human brain research. Provides access to professional
grade brain data with a quick and easy to use design. Uses
fourteen channel EEG that senses whole brain activity.
Saline-based electrodes are with wet sensors. Minimal

setup time is only about five minutes. This device works
wirelessly. You may connect your computer or mobile
phone. This device lasts for up to twelve hours. To detect
head movements, nine-axis motion sensors are available.
[5]

sensors are located in the frontal, temporal, parietal and
occipital part of the head. Green sensors show a bipolar
connection that is virtually obtained by subtracting the
values of two adjacent electrodes. The advantage of this
process is the elimination of amplitude artifacts. [5]

3 Emotiv Xavier ControlPanel
The measurement of the signal is being done with free
software Emotiv Xavier ControlPanel. Available
detections in this app are mental commands, performance
metrics, and facial expressions. Here are used
performance metrics that include excitement,
engagement, relaxation, interest, stress, and focus.

Fig. 1 Headset Emotiv Epoc+. [5]

There are fourteen EEG sensors for sense brain activity
and two CMS/DRL references (left/right mastoid process
alternative). CMS (Common Mode Sense) is an active
electrode and DRL (Driven Right Leg) is a passive
electrode. [5]

The individual performance metrics are color-coded. It is
also possible to adjust the length of two time frames. At
the top of the picture, we can see the signal status. The
signal can be either high quality, reduced or unmeasured.
At the top right of the picture, we can check the signal
quality of each sensor.

The yellow sensors are the basic electrode connected to
the reference electrode. They are unipolar and located on
the ears and thereby acquire basic input data. Green

4 Experimental part
4.1 Visual stimuli
The presentation was made containing ten images where
each is displayed after six seconds. Length of the overall
record is one minute. Various types of images have been
selected. The presentation contains a sequence of pictures
of cute animals, funny dog, hedgehog in a mug, starved
kids, love, cute bunny, scary house, sea, spider, and nature
in the spring.
4.2 Auditory stimuli
In this section, six different types of sounds and music
were edited and modified. Each lasting twenty seconds.
Length of the overall record is two minutes. It contains
relaxing music, funny music, death metal, fairy tale, pop
music, and horror sounds.
4.3 Measurement using Emotiv Epoc+

Fig. 6 Epoc+ – good electrodes contact quality.

The first step is to charge the headset. The second step is
to hydrate the sensors. Sensors must be very well hydrated
to ensure good contact quality. The third step is to install
the sensors. The fourth step is to turn on the headset. For
connection USB cable is used here. The last step is fitting
the headset with good contact quality.

4.3.1 Visual stimuli – subject 1

Fig. 7 Subject 1 – brain signals measured by Epoc+ headset
responding to visual stimuli.

We can see reactions to various visual stimuli on the
graph. A significant increase in interest was observed in
the picture of cute animals, funny dog, and spider. The
stress and focus graphs leveled up in the picture of a funny
dog and hedgehog in a mug. Relaxation was almost at the
same level during the measurement. A huge increase in
excitement can be seen, for instance, in the picture of a
funny dog and spider.
4.3.2 Visual stimuli – subject 2

If we cannot achieve good signal quality for all sensors,
we can additionally wet them again.

Major changes in the graph were observed on each
individual transitions between images. For example, we

can see a huge increase in interest in the picture of starved
kids and the picture of the sea. Increased engagement can
be seen in the picture of a funny dog and a picture of
nature in the spring. We can see a level up in stress while
watching images of starved kids and a scary house.
Relaxation slightly increased in the last picture of nature
in spring. A raise can be seen in the excitement graph
while watching the picture of love, cute bunny, sea, and
spider. Each time we can see an increment in focus signal
on significant parts of pictures between different images.

We may notice that some signals may not change at
all if the sensor does not have a good signal.

5 Discussion
During the last decades, a new technology BCI has
emerged by which the human brain can directly
communicate with the environment. BCIs offer a way of
bypassing typical nerve pathways by providing novel
output pathways to interact with a variety of applications.
Though research into BCI technology is still in early
phases, many significant developments have been made.
[3] Research in BCIs has achieved impressive progress
towards implementing assistive technologies for
restoration or substitution of lost motor capabilities, as
well as supporting technologies for healthy people.
However, effective implementation of these interfaces
from proof-of-concept prototypes into reliable real-time
applications is still in progress. In one study was shown,
that the performance of the Emotiv Epoc+ headset is
comparable to that found in professional devices. [6]
Another study evaluated the detection accuracy of
Emotiv Epoc+ intended for personal use by normal,
healthy users. Results found the system to perform
significantly better than a chance for all mental actions,
and improve over time with additional training data.
These results indicate the Emotiv Epoc+ system performs
its function as a BCI with an acceptable level of accuracy,
yielding many new possibilities. [7] Low-cost EEG
headset devices are fast becoming a key instrument for
BCI applications. However, there are some problems with
using EEG devices like BCI illiteracy and artifacts. [8]
The noninvasive recording procedure is safe and easy
to apply. An Emotiv Epoc+ headset is a relatively cheap
and easily available tool for research, games, etc.

4.3.3 Auditory stimuli – subject 1

Fig. 9 Subject 1 – brain signals measured by Epoc+ headset
responding to auditory stimuli.

The graph shows significant changes in individual
auditory stimuli. For example, the interest increased the
most while listening to the funny music, jingle for fairy
tale and in pop music. The level of stress increased the
most in the funny music, death metal and horror sounds.
Relaxation slightly increased in the death metal. This may
be due to the fact, that the subject likes death metal. The
level of excitement changed depending on the different
genres. The biggest jump in excitement was while
listening to death metal. We can also see that the focus
was increased while listening to funny music and horror
sounds.
4.3.4 Auditory stimuli – subject 2

6 Conclusion
This study investigated the usability BCI of Emotiv
Epoc+ headset for communication. The experimental
evaluation of the device was performed with two
participants. Overall, it was processed by four
measurements. To examine brain activity the record of
brain activity from Epoc+ device responding to visual and
auditory stimuli was used. One subject was a man with
short hair. Setup time was about five minutes. The second
subject was a woman with long and dense hair. The
helmet setup was about nine minutes. The values of
individual subjects to various stimuli are very different,
possibly due to differences between the participants. Each
sensor in headset measures different performance metrics.
Thus, the failure of a sensor can cause a loss of
performance metrics to which it belongs.
In conclusion, the applicability of the Epoc+ helmet is
sufficient for both scientific and other research purposes.

Fig. 10 Subject 2 – brain signals measured by Epoc+ headset
responding to auditory stimuli.

From the graph, we can see that the interest and
excitement increased individually according to the
popular genre of the subject. The stress level also
gradually decreased and increased according to the type
of music. For example, stress has increased the most while
listening to the horror sounds. Relaxation slightly
increased while listening to funny music and the fairy tale.
We can also see that the focus is increased significantly
while changes in tonality and music.
