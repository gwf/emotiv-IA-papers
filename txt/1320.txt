Abstract
Background: Gait disorders in individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) may be associated with alterations in the
motor control system and aggravated by psychoemotional and cognitive issues. Therapeutic strategies aimed at
self-perception and motor regulation seem to be promising. Motor imagery (MI) has been shown to be one of
these strategies, but there is still no clear evidence of its applicability in this population. The aim of this trial is to
determine the effects of motor-imagery training on the gait and electroencephalographic activity of individuals
with PD.
Methods/design: The sample will consist of 40 individuals, aged between 45 and 75 years, in the mild and
moderate phase of the disease, with the ability to generate voluntary mental images. They will be assessed for
cognitive level, degree of physical disability, mental-image clarity, kinematic gait variables, electroencephalographic
activity and mobility. Next, subjects will be randomly assigned to an experimental group (EG) and a control group
(CG). The EG will perform motor imagery and gait, while the CG will only engage in gait exercises. Twelve training
sessions will be conducted lasting up to 90 min each, three times a week, for 4 weeks. The subjects will be
reassessed on the kinematic variables of gait, electroencephalographic activity and mobility at 1, 7 and 30 days after
the final training session.
Discussion: The results may provide an important advance in neurological rehabilitation where an easy-access and
low-cost intervention may help to improve gait, electroencephalographic activity and mobility in individuals with
PD.

Background
Motor alterations caused by Parkinson’s disease (PD)
significantly affect gait, creating cognitive dependence in
improving movement patterns; that is, gait becomes more
vulnerable to external influences [1]. External clues provide information and require the individual’s attention to
movement, activating frontal cortex regions to control its
execution [2–4]. Studies suggest that these clues may help

improve gait pattern and electroencephalographic (EEG)
activity in patients with PD [5, 6]. A recent review study
conducted by Bočková and Rektor (2019) [7] indicates
that patients with PD face a general slowdown of background activity, excessive synchronization of beta-rhythm
activity and disturbed movement-related gamma-rhythm
oscillations in the basal ganglia and in the corticosubcortical and cortico-cortical motor loops, suppressible
by dopaminergic medication, as well as by high-frequency
deep-brain stimulation. Although dopaminergic therapy is
currently the best treatment for PD, gait dysfunctions are
commonly resistant to drug therapy, especially in the
advanced stages of the disease.

Motor imagery (MI) [8], defined as imagining a motor
action without physically executing it [9], is a cognitive
strategy that, along with other types of external clues,
demands attention to the sequence of a trained movement, which can be performed visually or kinesthetically.
It has been shown that MI can produce replicable EEG
patterns over primary sensory and motor areas [10, 11],
and despite deficits in the supplementary motor area
from the indirect effect of the basal ganglia, patients with
PD have preserved locomotor imagery observed during
the on-medication state [12]. The mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), located in the brainstem region
and consisting of the pedunculopontine and cuneiform
nuclei, is modulated by changes in imagined locomotion
in healthy humans [13]. MLR also modulates cortical
networks similar to those involved during real gait [14].
In neurological rehabilitation, the use of MI has generally been associated with physical practice (PP). Motor
imagery has several advantages, such as the opportunity
to increase the number of repetitions safely and autonomously, without excessive fatigue, in addition to allowing
the mental training of motor tasks, when and where the
patient wants or is able to perform them. Furthermore,
MI enables more demanding or complex motor tasks,
such as gait, or when PP is impossible or very difficult.
Despite these advantages, MI is a complex process that
is not easy to integrate into clinical practice [15]. Its association with PP, however, seems to be more effective
than PP alone in enhancing motor function [16].
Two studies that associated MI with PP, in order to
determine the motor effects on individuals with PD,
showed a significant decline in bradykinesis [17] and an
improvement in the kinematic aspects of gait [18].
Another study that correlated MI with PP showed no
gait improvement in individuals with PD [19]. A fourth
study that compared MI with relaxation sessions, both
associated with PP, found no improvement in the mobility of these patients [20]. The protocols used, different
training times between studies and the lack of follow-up
precluded confirming the duration of the effects
observed.
In light of the gaps in the methodologies presented, a
therapeutic plan can be devised involving MI, which has
been shown to be promising, albeit still inconclusive. As
such, there is a need to develop more effective training
protocols in order to optimize the rehabilitation process
of individuals with PD. To that end, a new MI protocol
associated with gait was created for patients with PD,
based on the protocols of El-Whishy [18] and Santiago
[19], but differing in terms of training time, observation
method and follow-up.
Few PD studies have investigated EEG functions during gait activity. Therefore, this study aims to contribute
to the literature on the pattern of brain activation

Page 2 of 8

(coherence intra- and inter-hemispheres and the spectral
power of alpha and beta rhythms) of individuals with PD
during gait activity, before and after the MI intervention.
Clinical quantitative measures of gait and mobility, most
commonly investigated by other studies, will also be
analyzed and correlated with EEG data.
Thus, this randomized clinical trial protocol should
determine the effects of MI training on the gait and EEG
activity of individuals with PD.

Methods/design
Design

This is a single-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial,
in line with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines (Fig. 1).
It will be conducted at the Laboratory of Intervention and
Analysis of Movement (LIAM), in the Physical Therapy Department of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte
(UFRN). Participants will be recruited from a population of
patients with PD treated in public and private hospitals and
reference centers in the city of Natal, Rio Grande do Norte
state, Brazil. They will be randomly allocated to an experimental group (EG; MI associated with PP) or a control
group (CG) (only PP). Outcome measures will be collected
by trained researchers at the start (week 0) and at the end
of the intervention (weeks 5 and 6), and 1 month after the
intervention (week 10). Analyses of inclusion criteria,
obtaining informed consent, data collection and statistical
analyses will be carried out by the researchers, who will be
blind to group allocation. Participants will be evaluated and
advised of the study procedures, in addition to giving their
informed consent. This project was approved by the
Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Rio
Grande do Norte, under protocol number 2.057.658 and
registered as a clinical trial at www.ClinicalTrials.gov (ID:
NCT03439800).
Sample size estimates

The sample size was calculated using the OpenEpi public
domain program, version 3.01 [21]. The calculation, based
on the outcome variable “hip range of motion” of individuals with PD submitted to MI associated with the PP of
gait, obtained by El-Whishy et al. [18] A power of 80%
was considered as well as a 95% confidence interval. The
mean and standard deviations were 54.7° and 7.2°, respectively, from which the sample size of 34 individuals (17 in
each group) was obtained. Added to this value was 10%
for possible sample losses, resulting in a final sample of 40
individuals, 20 each in the two groups under study.
Participants
Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Patients will be included according to the following
criteria: (1) Diagnosis of PD by a neurologist; (2) Age

Nascimento et al. Trials

(2019) 20:626

Page 3 of 8

Fig. 1 The schedule of enrollment, interventions and assessments demonstrated in the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for
Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) Figure

between 45 and 75 years; (3) In the mild to moderate
phase of the disease (including patients between stages
1.5 and 3 on the Hoehn and Yahr scale) [22]; (4) Using
antiparkinson medication, without adaptation during
study participation; (5) Exhibiting no cognitive impairment, according to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The cutoff point was established
considering the individuals’ schooling (illiterate: 18;
some schooling: 24) [23]; (6) Be able to imagine motor
activities in the kinesthetic modality (according to the
Revised Movement Imagery Questionnaire – MIQ-R).
The cutoff point was 20 for the kinesthetic modality,
indicating at least “somewhat easy to feel” the kinesthetically imagined movement [24]; (7) Not having
undergone stereotaxic surgery; and (8) No other associated neurological diseases; no musculoskeletal alterations that hinder gait; corrected vision or hearing.
The following patients will be excluded: (1) Those

exhibiting hemodynamic instability before or during
training (systolic and diastolic blood pressure above
180 mmHg and 110 mmHg, respectively) [25]; (2) Not
understanding any stage of the training protocol; and
(3) Experiencing acute pain and/or discomfort that
would hinder the proposed activities.
Outcomes
Primary outcome

The hip range of motion, a kinematic variable of gait,
will be obtained by the Qualisys Motion Capture System
(Qualisys Medical AB, 411 13, Gothenburg, Sweden).
This system records the spatio-temporal variables of gait,
as well as the angular variations of the hip, knee and
ankle joints. It is a photographic system based on a video
that reconstructs movement in three dimensions (3D),
composed of six Qualisys Oqus 300 cameras, connected
in series and that emit and capture infrared light, which

Nascimento et al. Trials

(2019) 20:626

is reflected by spherical markers placed on specific
anatomical structures.
Secondary outcomes

The secondary outcomes will be the spectral power of
the alpha and beta rhythms, intra- and inter-hemisphere
coherence between frontal and fronto-central channels
and mobility. Electroencephalographic activity will be
measured by Emotiv EPOC+, which provides EEG data.
The device uses contact sensors attached to the flexible
plastic arms of a wireless headset. The headset has 14
sensors that are able to detect facial expressions, head
rotation, emotions and conscious mental commands.
For the present study, the changes in EEG activity captured on the surface of the patient’s head will be monitored before and after 12 training sessions (including
follow-ups). MATLAB software will be used to process
the data [26, 27]. Mobility will be assessed by the Timed
Up and Go Test (TUG). This consists of rising from an
ordinary chair (with no arms), walking 3 m, turning
through 180°, and sitting down again as fast as possible
wearing typical walking shoes. The shorter the time to
perform the activity, the better the mobility [28]. The
time spent on the two attempts will be recorded using a
digital stopwatch.
Randomization

Randomization will be computer-generated in randomized blocks using the randomization.com system. The
process will be carried out by a volunteer not affiliated
with the research, who will preserve allocation anonymity, randomly separating the individuals into a control
group (CG) and experimental group (EG). The volunteer
will also prepare sealed envelopes, using codes to
represent the groups.
Only the researchers in charge of conducting the training sessions will be aware of meaning of each code and
participant allocation. They will open the envelope corresponding to the patient number before patients start
the training.
The researchers responsible for the initial assessment
and reassessment will not be informed of allocation during data collection and statistical analysis. Data analysis
will also be performed by one of the evaluators, who will
only have access to the codification and will not be
informed about which group each code corresponds to.
The present protocol has been prepared in accordance
with relevant items from the SPIRIT Checklist (see
Additional file 1) and the SPIRIT Figure (Fig. 1).
Intervention

This protocol will be based on those of El-Whishy [18]
and Santiago [19]. Training will start on the day

Page 4 of 8

following the initial assessment, which will be divided
into 2 days.
The subjects who are randomly allocated to the EG
will be submitted to a protocol consisting of five training
stages, as follows: awareness, problem identification, progressive relaxation, MI of the task and PP of the task.
The CG will undergo the following stages: awareness,
problem explanation, progressive relaxation and PP of
the task; that is, stages 1, 2, 3 and 5.
After opening the identification envelope, the researcher in charge of training will describe the stages
that the participants will be submitted to. Before this,
blood pressure and heart rate will be measured and
monitored by a digital sphygmomanometer (Visomat
Comfort III, Incoterm®, São Paulo, Brazil).
In the event that patients exhibit altered vital signs,
they will be asked to remain seated and try to relax. If
the situation persists, the patient will be instructed to
visit their physician.
Before training sessions begin, the researcher in charge
will ask the patient to walk around the course to be used
that day if it is the first, fifth or ninth session, so that the
execution time can be recorded and used during the
fourth stage. A detailed description of the training
protocol is shown below.
EG and CG protocol
Awareness

In the EG, the subjects will analyze the sequence of the
gait cycle, in order to understand the gait phases, which
should facilitate motor planning and problem identification. The therapist will show a video of a typical normal
gait for an adult man or woman with no pathologies and
will compare it to the video of the patient’s own gait.
The patient will watch the videos in two planes: the coronal and sagittal, which will be shown more than once.
After viewing both videos, the patient will be encouraged
to analyze and score their own gait characteristics, which
differ from those of the individuals with no pathology. If
the subject cannot adequately verbalize, the therapist
can give hints on which important aspects should be
observed. The CG subjects will watch a video on PD that
does not mention physical therapy treatments for gait.
The time allotted to watch the video will be the same as
for the EG.
Problem identification/explanation

In the EG, the subjects will identify gait problems and
compare their walking and typical gait. Next, they will
use comparative information for feedback. It may be necessary to encourage the patient in terms of the characteristics that should be compared, such as arm balance,
stride length and gait speed. In the CG, the patients will

Nascimento et al. Trials

(2019) 20:626

explain their understanding of the video that they
watched in the previous stage.
Progressive relaxation

At the start, both groups’ participants will be instructed
to sit comfortably in a chair with their backs supported,
hands in their lap, close their eyes while breathing slowly
and deeply through the nose and say the word “hoo”
silently to themselves while exhaling. They will be
instructed to concentrate and be aware of their breathing, while repeating the respiratory pattern 10 times.
MI of gait

In the first part, the EG subjects will be asked to mentally repeat from stage 1 to the problem-identification
stage, with their eyes closed. After the mental-imagery
phase, subjects will be asked to verbalize a difference
between normal gait sequences and their own gait. In
the second part, they will practice MI of the sequence of
movements of the gait pattern in adults with no
pathologies (considered the typical pattern), imagining
themselves walking along a straight course and feeling
all the components of gait (for example, movement,
muscle action, arm balance and weight bearing), while
correcting the problems found in the video. Seated and
with their eyes closed, they will imagine each movement
stage in the kinesthetic modality, where “feeling” must
be emphasized: the movement, muscle action, arm
balance, weight-bearing, etc.
During the EG stage, the setting should be as quiet as
possible and the patient will be asked to wear noisecanceling earphones. There will be three sessions of 10
repetitions. Each repetition will be controlled and last
the same amount of time as that measured during the
patient’s lap around the course, with 20 s rest between
each repetition. At each repetition, patients will be
instructed to close their eyes and imagine the sensation
present while rising from a chair, adopting their posture
and when walking around the course. They must remember to start with the least affected limb in order to
perform the gait pattern, making the expected corrections. At the end of each repetition, the patient will receive a sign from the therapist, who will provide
instructions and time the duration of the next repetition.
Each MI session will be held alternately with the PP
sessions (described in the next topic: “stage 5 PP of
gait”). MI will always be prior to the PP of gait.
PP of gait

Both groups will engage in the PP of gait, paying close
attention to the sequence. This will be performed on a
flat, firm, 6-m-long surface, following the same number
of series and repetitions as in the second part of MI. In
the EG, the second part of MI and PP will be repeated

Page 5 of 8

alternately. In the CG, execution will occur normally,
without alternate repetitions of stages 4 and 5, but there
will also be guidelines on the PP stages to be performed.
In the first of 12 sessions, during stage 5, the patient will be asked to walk around the course as best
they can. During the repetitions, the researcher can
verbalize a number of feedback sentences, in relation
to the aspects of gait that should receive attention
and be corrected. This will be allowed until the second session. From the third session onwards, at the
onset of PP, patients will be reminded about the corrections previously highlighted.
From the fifth session onwards, EG subjects will
undergo the previously described protocol; however, in
stage 4, the imagined gait will be in a setting with obstacles, represented by a busy street. The patient will be
instructed to imagine walking along the street, dodging
people, avoiding holes, walking down sidewalks and entering stores with narrow doorways. In stage 5, they will
perform gait with obstacles, as follows: zigzagging
around two cones, walking through a narrow doorway,
climbing up and down one step, climbing up and down
one ramp, climbing up and down one step, stepping over
three mini barriers and one small box, climbing up and
down one small ladder, walking over foam and then
returning over the entire course.
In the first repetition of the fifth session in the PP portion, the obstacles will be arranged in the same way as
shown in the videos, and the patient will start at the beginning of the circuit. At each series conducted, the point
where the patient starts the trajectory will be changed and
this pattern will be used for the others. In the subsequent
sessions, the course will be slightly changed and based on
photographs and the same change will be repeated with
all the patients. The CG will also perform the aforementioned protocol, but in stage 5, gait will be executed in an
environment with obstacles (the same as the EG).
From the ninth training session onwards, EG subjects
will carry out both MI and PP of gait with two tasks.
Mental imagery will involve a supermarket, where the
patient will be instructed to imagine walking around the
environment, shopping for products beginning with a
letter that will be drawn at each series.
The dual task performed in stage 5 will be different at
each session, progressing in difficulty. In the ninth session, the patient must say words starting with the letters
drawn in each series; in the 10th session, they will be
asked the names of fruits according to the letters selected; in the 11th session, it will be the names of animals and, finally, in the 12th session they will perform
subtractions, starting with a decreasing sequence of 90
minus 3. Furthermore, another motor activity will be associated with gait such as picking up an object along the
way and bringing it back to the start of the course. In

Nascimento et al. Trials

(2019) 20:626

the CG, subjects will only engage in dual-task gait,
following the same protocol of activities established for
the EG.
This protocol will be applied on the day following
initial assessment, executed in 12 training sessions of
at most 90 min, three times a week for 4 weeks.
Experimental group individuals will be instructed to
continue to practice MI of gait in their daily lives
during the training period. They will be instructed to
fill in a diary with information on the quantity of days,
number of repetitions and duration of the training
performed at home. All the participants will be reassessed 1, 7 and 30 days after the last training session
in terms of the kinematic variables of gait using the
Qualisys Motion Capture System®, mobility using the
TUG and EEG activity via Emotiv EPOC+. During the
gait test, the patient will be instructed to walk as they
did over the past days, since the beginning of the study
participation. As the evaluator is blind to allocation
groups, they will not know whether the patient is making corrections or not in the gait. The schematic study
design is shown in Fig. 2.

Data analysis

Data analysis will be conducted with the following variables: (1) Kinematic: speed (m/s), stride length (m),
stance and swing time (s) of the most affected limb, hip
range of motion, maximum hip extension during stance
(°), maximum hip flexion during swing (°), maximum
knee flexion during swing (°) and ankle dorsiflexion (°);
(2) EEG activity: alpha (8–12 Hz)- and beta (13–30 Hz)frequency bands; and (3) Mobility: average time to
conduct the TUG.
Analysis of variance with repeated measures will be
used to determine whether there are statistically significant differences between baseline, post training and
monitoring measures of the CG and the EG.
Group descriptions will be presented as means and
standard deviations. Intention-to-treat analysis will be
conducted for dropout data, using the last available value
to represent the absent assessment sessions.

Discussion
The protocol aims to determine the effects of motorimagery training on gait and the EEG activity of

Nascimento et al. Trials

(2019) 20:626

individuals with PD. This protocol was based on those
of Santiago [19] and El-Whishy [18], but the type of
observation, follow-up and training time were altered.
In Santiago’s protocol [19], the action was visualized
using images of the sequential stages of gait. It is a static
method that does not resemble the real pattern. The
protocol, based on El-Whishy [18], involves observing
the action using videos of normal gait and of a patient
with PD, enabling better identification of gait changes
and familiarizing individuals with their daily gait pattern,
making the training more dynamic.
The second alteration is related to the lack of followup in El-Whishy’s protocol [18]. It is known that the
presence of a follow-up is important in confirming the
retention time of the observed effects. This protocol,
which is different from the aforementioned, suggests a
follow-up in order for these effects can be assessed.
The third and last alteration is related to the training
used. Based on the study by Santiago [19] and ElWhishy’s protocol [18], it is suggested that patients with
PD require more time to achieve favorable results. As
such, this study proposed to use a longer training period
in order to investigate whether the increase in MI
training associated with PP is able to produce benefits
superior to those of PP alone.
The methodological strength of the proposed protocol
lies in the fact that it is a prospectively registered randomized controlled study. The study also includes random allocation and masking, in addition to an intent-totreat analysis. The sample size was calculated to provide
an adequate statistical base to identify intergroup differences in the primary outcome. This study has limitations, given that the participants and therapist cannot be
blinded in complex interventions. Moreover, it is difficult to ensure that patients will imagine movement, that
they will use this imagination in the kinesthetic modality
and in the number of repetitions proposed.
In conclusion, the results of the present study may provide an important advance in neurological rehabilitation.
An easy-access, low-cost intervention may help improve
gait, EEG activity and mobility in individuals with PD.
