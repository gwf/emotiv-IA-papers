ABSTRACT
In this study, the
he right and left commands explored are based on the actual movement of
lifting either left or right hand and the imaginary movement of lifting either left or right hand.
For this initial study, EEG signals recorded based on the actual physical movements will be
collected as the raw data, as well as the EEG signals recorded when imaginary movements are
performed. In the scope of this research,
research, the EEG processing focuses on analyzing two
different features namely SD and ESD. These features are used as inputs to be classified by
the ANN classifier. The performance of this classifier is then evaluated by measuring its
accuracy in distinguishing
shing the different interpreted commands. Based on findings from the
conducted analysis, we found that PSD is the best feature to be fed as input to the ANN
classifier with a high accuracy of 93% compared to when ESD feature is used as the input.
Keywords: BCI; EEG; classification; Energy Spectral Density (ESD); Power Spectral

1. INTRODUCTION
Researchers have studied the functional brain activities that relate to the variation of surface
potentials on the scalp and brain surface for many years. This signal which is called
electroencephalography (EEG), has been recorded using various methods of electrode
placements, filtered, amplified and processed to detect the required brain activities. The EEG
signals provide rich information about the electrical activity of a human brain. EEG signal is
captured from the scalp of a human, which is the electrical signal that undergoes changes in
amplitude as well as in frequency while different mental tasks are performed. In this context,
Brain Computer Interface (BCI) applications are useful in recognizing and classifying
different mental activities. With a combination of advanced techniques of signal acquisition,
preprocessing, classification and algorithm, a BCI application could be developed to assist
impaired people in crying out their daily activities [1].
BCI is a technology that enables one to connect the brain activities of an individual to a
computer. BCI allows the individual to control various devices with the right generation of
brain signals without using any muscular activities. In recent years, mental tasks wave been
studied by many research [2-4] and their study shows that BCI is useful especially for
physically challenged individuals. Such individuals may have lost all their voluntary actions
and can only rely on their cognitive actions to live their life. Having BCI systems can greatly
help people especially the unprivileged ones to live their lives. The context of our study is in
the scope of BCI that focuses on the interpretation of EEG signals.
The process of acquiring and processing the EEG signal from human brain is not
straightforward. In this regards, artifacts and noises are removed from the raw EEG data in the
pre-processing stage, after which filtering, feature extraction and normalization process are
conducted. Two different features are extracted from the EEG data, specifically Energy
Spectral Density (ESD) and Power Spectral Density (PSD). These features will be employed
as inputs for the classification analysis. The aim of this study is to have a better understanding
of the performance of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) when used as a classifier based on
these two different features, i.e. specifically in classifying the left and right commands.

Fig.1.
Fig. 1 shows the Emotiv Epoc Neuroheadset, a model of EEG recording device that is used in
this study.. The headset comes with 14 independent electrodes that consist of felt pads with
gold connections
ons to increase the sensitivity of the pickups. These felt sensors need to be moist
at all time to conduct the potential difference across the skull, this is done by using a saline
solution [1].. Emotiv Epoc Neuroheadset is chosen as the recording device for this study due
to its reliability for most application [5] and it is also low-cost.
In this scope of research, the recorded EEG signals are analyzed especially to monitor the
electrical activity of sensorimotor areas of
o the left and right brain hemispheres. This is done
by extracting a set of discriminative features to enable us to differentiate between the left and
right-hand
hand movement, for either actual or imaginary movement. The extracted features are
then fed to the ANN classifier as inputs, especially to classify the left and right hand
movement.. Before such feature extraction process is performed, the EEG data are first filtered
according
ording to different EEG bands. Table 1 shows the different bands of EEG signal togeth
together
with their frequency ranges [66-8] and description.

1.2. Imaginary Movement
An important part of the study focuses on capturing and analyzing the recorded EEG data
based on imagined movements, which are intended as commands from the brain. The activity
to generate such EEG signal should not involve any physical action such as lifting the hands
or moving the head. During the experiment or data collection session, the subjects are asked

N. Zaini et al.

J Fundam
Fund Appl Sci. 2017, 9(4S), 193-209

196

to visualize or imagine on doing a particular physical activity. To do this, the subjects are first
trained and provided with proper
proper instruction. This is to ensure that they will able to correctly
perform the needed action as to allow the correct EEG signal to be recorded. This procedure
involves a lot of exercises in brain activity with the subjects.
All of us know that brain is the major network control of the body functions and abilities in a
human system. These mean that brain is the control unit that controls all functions or activities
that human can perform such as vision, hearing and moving. This study is dedicated
especially to those who have physical disabilities and having difficulties to move on their own.
But despite such disabilities, they still have a normal brain function. This means that such
individuals have the ability to imagine or visualize on moving their physical body. In this
context, the activities in the brain generated based on a visualized physical movement have
some correlation with the brain activities when the actual physical movement is done. For
example, the neural signals of right and left-hand
left
movementss are controlled by the
sensorimotor areas in the brain like all muscle movements in the human body. While the
visualization of the hand-movement
movement also activates the same brain areas that are normally
activated when the body is preparing for and doing the real
r hand-movement.
movement.

Fig. 2 shows the flow of activities undergone throughout this project. The literature review
activity is first conducted to gather all related information about the project. Many facts and
ideas in regards to the processing and analysis of EEG signal are explored from relevant
technical papers and articles. The experimental procedure is then started, where raw EEG
signal data is acquired before they can be processed. For this purpose, experimental sessions
are conducted with a number of subjects. For the physical-movement experiment, each
subject is asked to lift their left or right hand for 30 seconds with eyes opened while for the
imaginary-movement experiment the subjects are asked to imagine lifting their left or right
hand with closed eyes. The detailed steps are further explained in Table 2. The activities
conducted during the experimental sessions are labeled as either physical or imaginary.

2.3. Preprocessing
Once EEG data are recorded, the signal processing will then commenced. This first step is
known as the signal pre-processing. To prepare data for this step, a special software provided
by the Emotiv, i.e. the Testbench software is used in order to export the recorded EEG data
to .csv files. The acquired “csv” files can then be imported to MATLAB software to be
processed. In order to have a clean EEG signal, the artifacts have to be removed from the
recorded data. Artifacts such as eye-blinking, electrocardiograms (ECGs), breathing from
respiratory system and any other internal or external noise [9-10] will affect the result.
Removal of artifacts from the EEG data is done by cutting off the signal amplitude that
exceeds -100 and 100 µV [11]. This is based on facts that artifacts and noises usually will
generate 10 to 100 times bigger amplitude rather than the EEG data itself [11-12].
After removal of artifacts and noises, the EEG data will then be filtered into it owns frequency
band by using the bandpass filter. Table 1 shows the frequency range for each band alpha,
beta, theta and delta band. The bandpass filter is chosen as the filter to further group the EEG
data into the different bands, with different frequency range.
2.4. Feature Extraction
After the signal preprocessing step, the EEG data becomes noise-free but the filtered data is
still not good enough for the analysis. Thus, the feature extraction process needs to be

199

performed first, especially to acquire the useful data in the form of features that are known to
carry the significant information or attributes of the EEG data. Such useful data, when fed to
the classifier as inputs will enable the classifier to classify the data into different
different groups based
on the different patterns captured in the EEG signal. In this study, the features that are
extracted from the EEG data are in the form of Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Energy
Spectral Density (ESD) values. The captured ESD values are
are further normalized by using the
power ratio and alpha beta ratio, while the PSD values are computed by using the mean data
ratio of each band.
2.5. Normalization
In this study, the normalization process is done only for the extracted ESD feature.
Normalization
zation is needed to ensure that the value of the data lies in between the desired range.
This technique is used to minimize the high value of power band ratio data. Equation (1)
shows an example of normalization in ESD mean relative and ESD Power Ratio.

where
here x is the target value of output data. For xmax is the maximum value of unscaled data
and xmin is the minimum value of unscaled data. For ymax is the maximum value of sscaled
data and ymin is the minimum value of scaled data.
2.6. ANN Classifier
For the classification analysis, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is constructed and fed
with either the PSD or ESD values as inputs and later evaluated for accuracy in classif
classifying the
given EEG signal data. ANN pattern classification can be categorized as either Single
Single-layer
Perceptron (SLP) or Multi-Layer
Layer Perceptron (MLP) [14].. SLP is known to have many
limitations and in this regards, some researchers have found that combinin
combining the single
perceptron might be useful for a larger network. Thus,
Thus for our study, MLP is chosen since it is
believed to provide a better solution. The general architecture
architecture of MLP is shown in Fig. 3.

Fig. 4 shows the architecture of MLP run on the MATLAB software. This figure shows that
there are 4 inputs, specifically the alpha, beta, theta and delta coefficients from feature
extraction process. The number of hidden layers used in this project is set and tested between
the range of 5 to 100 for all datasets. This is done especially to determine the best number of
hidden units to produce the highest classification accuracy. The classification accuracy value
here refers to the measure of classifier’s ability to accurately classify the data for right or
left-hand movement.

Fig.4. General architecture of MLP in MATLAB
The activation function specifically used in the ANN pattern classification is called the
tan-sigmoid (Tansig) function [11]. Tansig function is usually used for hidden and output
layer. Fig. 5 shows the graph of Tansig activation function where the input is between +1 and
-1 range and any other value outside the range will be pushed inward within the range.
ANN pattern classification is trained by using 3 types of datasets that are physical, imaginary
and combined physical and imaginary dataset. Table 3 shows the dataset representing the
physical- movement. The dataset consists of data for physically lifting the left and right hand.
There is a total of 40 data, in which 20 data are captured for physically lifting the left hand
and another 20 for physically lifting the right hand.

Table 5 shows the dataset of combined physical and imaginary hand movement data. The
combined dataset consists of 80 data where 40 data are for physically and imagined left-hand
movement, while another 40 data are for physically and imagined right-hand movement.
These three types of datasets will be fed as inputs to the ANN classifier. The performance of
the classification process, i.e. in the form of the accuracy value will be captured and later
analyzed.
The ANN pattern classification is trained by using all the three types of datasets mentioned
above. By default, the dataset will be divided into training, testing and validation. The data for
training, testing and validation were not manually set (following default). Because of that, the
average of 10 times run is recorded between hidden unit 5 to 100 (increment of 5).

2.7. Data Validation
Once the EEG features are classified, the results are then validated and discussed. The
important result obtained is in term of accuracy value as shown in the confusion matrix (see
Fig. 6).

N. Zaini et al.

The confusion matrix is used in order to illustrate and validate the results from the
classification analysis. There are two output classes, which are left and right command. By
referring to Fig. 6, there are 4 terms shown in the confusion matrix which are True Positive
(TP), False Negative (FN), False Positive (FP) and True Negative (TN). We set the positive
part as the right-hand lifting, while the negative part is set as the left-hand lifting. To elaborate,
TP is the section where the network correctly predicted the right command from the data of
subjects performing the right-hand movement. While TN is the section when the network
correctly predicted the left command from the data of subjects performing the left-hand
movement. FP, which is also known as “Type I error” section is when the network wrongly
predicted the right command, i.e. from the data of subjects performing the left-hand
movement. While FN which is also known as the “Type II error” section is when the network
wrongly predicted the left command, i.e. from the data of subjects performing the right-hand
movement.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This section presents and discusses the results obtained by the ANN classifier based on the
three different datasets, i.e. i) physical-movement, ii) imaginary-movement and iii) the
combination of physical and imaginary movement. Three types of EEG features are also
employed as inputs for the ANN classifier specifically i) PSD, ii) ESD Mean Relative and iii)
ESD Power Ratio.
Based on the different types of datasets, three different classification analysis are conducted
for this study.

Firstly,

the classification analysis is performed based on the

physical-movement dataset where the EEG data are captured based on the subjects’ actual
physical movement of either lifting the right or left hand. Next is the classification analysis
based on the imaginary-movement dataset. The results obtained from this second analysis will
be compared with the results from the first analysis on physical-movement classification.
Finally, the third classification analysis is based on the combined physical and imaginary
movement datasets. The main aim of conducting this analysis is to see whether there is a

N. Zaini et al.

203

positive correlation between the physical and imaginary datasets in performing either left or
right movement. The detailed results obtained for all the three classifications are shown in
Table 6-8 and discussed as follow.

Table 6 tabulates results of the classification analysis based on the physical-movement dataset.
The percentage values shown are the accuracy measures achieved by the classification
analysis for each different EEG feature (as inputs) and for the different number of hidden
neuron layers configured for the ANN Classifier. From the findings, it can be concluded that

N. Zaini et al.

204

the highest accuracy value of the classification analysis is achieved with PSD data as inputs at
93%, i.e. when the number of hidden layers is 5. On the other hand, the classification analysis
with ESD Mean Relative and ESD Power Ratio features as inputs achieve the highest
accuracy value of 82.5% for both features, specifically for 30 and 40 hidden units respectively.
From this analysis based on the physical-movement dataset, it can be concluded that PSD is
the best EEG feature to be fed as input to the ANN classifier since it could produce the
highest accuracy value of 93%, at a low number of hidden layers.
Table 7 tabulates the results obtained from the classification analysis performed on the
imaginary-movement dataset. From the findings, the highest accuracy value is obtained when
PSD feature is used as the input, with the accuracy value of 76.25%, i.e. for 55 hidden units.
This can be compared to the classification analysis when ESD Mean Relative and ESD Power
Ratio features as inputs, which obtained lower accuracy value of 64.5% and 73.75% for 30
and 70 hidden units respectively. Based on the obtained accuracy values, it is shown that the
patterns encoded in the imaginary dataset are much difficult to be classified and differentiate
in comparison to the physical dataset.

Table 8 tabulates the results obtained from the classification analysis based on the combined
physical and imaginary dataset. From the results, it is shown that the highest accuracy value
for PSD, ESD Mean Relative and ESD Power Ratio are at 85.65%, 61.77% and 74.52%, i.e.
specifically for 70, 30 and 75 hidden units respectively. It is shown that the classification
analysis with ESD Mean Relative feature as input performs poorly with the low accuracy
value of 62%. In this analysis, once again, the PSD data leads to the best classification
analysis with the highest accuracy value of 85.65%. The only difference is that this high
accuracy value is now obtained at a higher number of hidden unit than before
(imaginary-movement dataset). By combining both physical and imaginary dataset, it is
shown that the accuracy value obtained is higher when compared to the classification analysis
based on only the imaginary dataset. With such findings, it is assumed that there is some
degree of correlation or similarity of patterns between EEG data of physical and imaginary
hand movement.
From the three different classification analysis (Table 6-8), it can be concluded that PSD work
best with ANN Classifier especially when dealing with physical data set with a high accuracy
value of 93%, compared to lower accuracy measures when ESD Mean Relative and ESD
Power Ratio are used as the inputs for the classification analysis.

4. CONCLUSION
Based on the experiment and analysis conducted in this study, PSD is found to be the best
feature of EEG data to be fed as input to the ANN Classifier, compared to ESD Mean
Relative and ESD Power Ratio feature values. In this context, PSD inputs have led to highest
classification accuracy value for both physical and imaginary datasets and also when both
physical and imaginary datasets are combined. It is also found that the number of hidden
neuron layers in the classification process directly affects the accuracy measure. For instance,
the classification analysis for the physical dataset with PSD values as input has obtained the

N. Zaini et al.

J Fundam Appl Sci. 2017, 9(4S), 193-209

207

highest accuracy value of 93% with 5 hidden layers. Whereas, for the classification analysis
with ESD Power Ratio as input, the highest classification accuracy is achieved at 82.5% with
30 hidden layers. The value of hidden neuron layers employed by the ANN classifier is
manually set by the programmer and the best setting can be determined following an iterative
process of dynamically changing the number of hidden layers being used.
In addition, it is also found that the highest classification accuracy is achieved when the
classification analysis is performed based on the physical-movement dataset. This occurs due
to the fact that the amplitude of the EEG signal is found to be lower when an individual is just
visualizing on doing the physical movement, compared to when they are doing the actual
physical movement. A positive correlation is also found between the physical and imaginary
datasets based on the classification analysis on the combined datasets. In this regards, the
classification analysis based on the PSD and ESD Power Ratio features achieved accuracy
value of more than 70%. This indicates that there are some similarities between the patterns of
brain activity caused by imaginary hand-movement with the brainwave patterns generated
based on the physical hand movement. Next, further study will be aimed at studying the
techniques on how to amplify the EEG [13] signals based on the imaginary command.
Another target is to further explore a better technique with less computational time and high
efficiency towards faster processing.
