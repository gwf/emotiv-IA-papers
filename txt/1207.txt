ABSTRACT
Initiated from the availability of a simple to use and portable wireless electroencephalography, an effort was taken
to find out the hemisphere of the brain that would be more active during human physical body movements. By recording
the human brain waves using this wireless headset, the electroencephalogram (EEG) data were then processed with
EEGLAB, which is an interactive Matlab toolbox. Visual inspections were performed from the output of Channel Spectra
and Maps. Data output from the power spectral density estimation from Matlab were tabulated using Microsoft Excel. The
more active brain hemisphere results from the visual inspections and tabulated data were either crisscross, no crisscross or
dominant regardless of the movement of the arm or leg raising and neck turning.
Keywords: physical movements, EEG, power spectral density.

INTRODUCTION
Using a simple setup and wireless neuro headset,
an effort was embarked to find out the general
understanding of the left hemisphere of the brain has
controlled over the right side of the physical body and vice
versa, the right hemisphere of the brain has controlled over
the left side of the physical body. This was previously
observed using the Electrical Capacitance Volume
Tomography [1]. The understanding of having control in
this context meant that the hemisphere of the brain being
more active. The more active hemisphere was determined
by comparing the power spectral density estimations
between the left and the right hemisphere of the brain [2].
The power spectral density estimations for the EEG data
could be produced using the Pwelch function in Matlab
[3]. The objective of this study was to find out the
hemisphere of the brain that is more active during physical
movements of the raising of the arms, or legs and turning
of the neck.
LITERATURE REVIEW
The EEG (electroencephalogram) is essential to
understand the electrical activity in a human brain. Brain
waves from both sides of the brain function are recorded
over time and displayed graphically on a display unit.
Brain waves are a map of electrical current firing from
neuron to neuron, for a while [4]. British physician
Richard Caton first noticed the brain's current in 1875. By
1924, German neurologist Hans Berger found a way to
read the current by developing what was known as the
electroencephalography.
The inception or the beginning of cerebral
potentials are established on the electrophysiological
premises of the nervous system. Neural function is
normally maintained by ionic gradients established by
neuronal membranes. Recognizing the generator sources
and electrical fields of propagation are basis for discerning

electrographic patterns that underlied the expressions of
the brain waves [5]. When electrical charges move within
the central nervous system, electrical signals are produced.
Ample duration and length of tiny quantities (in
microvolts) of electrical currents of cerebral activity are
needed to be amplified and displayed for analysis. The
EEG displays the continuos and shifting voltage fields
differing with various positions on the scalp. In contrast,
the electrocardiogram only measures in the order of
millivolts [6].
METHODS
Getting ready the subjects and setup for the
electroencephalography
The scalp of the subject should be clean and free
from the use of any hair cream or gel because this can
disrupt the contact of the electrode probes. The electrode
probes where the sensors were located must be amply
hydrated using drops of saline to ensure good contact. The
sensors must be individually inserted into the black plastic
headset arms by turning each one clock-wise one-quarter
turn until a click was felt. Subject must be in proximity to
the Bluetooth dongle for good connectivity between the
computer and the neuro headset.
Recording the brainwaves
The recording of EEG data was done using the
EEG software, which was pre-installed into a computer
running on the Windows 7 operating system. A USB
powered bluetooth dongle was used to connect the neuro
headset to the EEG software in the computer. The signal
quality can be seen on the software with color indicators
(Figure-1). Green for good signal, orange for poor signal,
red for bad signal and black for no signal.

there were 4 subjects involved in the recording of the
EEG. They were all healthy males and in the age range of
20 to 30 years old. Every recording was done with the
subject’s eyes remain closed and cotton buds in the ear.
This was deemed necessary to condition and to minimize
distractions to the subjects.
The brain waves of the subjects were being
recorded in successive routines as shown in Table-1 and
Table-2 below. The recording of EEG was done
continuosly (meaning the subject would do all the
instructions without stopping or restarting the recording)
for each arm, leg and neck routines. The recording was
stopped after the arm routine and then was restarted for the
leg routine.
The first relax condition of each routine was
alloted ten seconds while the subsequent relax condition
were alloted only 5 seconds each. Only the ten-seconds
relax condition would be used for data extraction but the
five-seconds relax condition were merely treated as
intervals for the next change of condition.

software when there was good contact between the

Loading and slicing the raw EEG data
In order to be able to load the EEG raw data
recorded using Emotiv EEG software, an interactive
Matlab toolbox for processing continuous and event
related EEG known as EEGLAB and an open source
software library for biomedical signal processing known
as BioSig must be pre-installed into the MATLAB
environement.
The recorded EEG data have a duration of 50
seconds for both the arm and leg routines. As for the neck
routine, it has 35 seconds of recorded data. The slicing of
data has to be done to seperate out the condition for relax,
left side, right side and both sides data for further analysis.
Only the data with ten seconds duration would be sliced.
The slicing of data was done using a feature in the
EEGLAB toolbox. After choosing the “Select Data”, there
would be a prompt to enter the minimum and maximum
time range that needed to be sliced. The data extracted
were two seconds after starting and two seconds before
ending of a condition. This would give a 6 seconds of data
for further data analysis. Each of the sliced data was saved
as a new dataset.

Visual inspections with channel spectra and maps
From the saved datasets of sliced data, channel
spectra and maps were performed by using the “Plot”
feature in EEGLAB. Before plotting this, information of
the position of each electrodes on the scalp needed to be
loaded using the feature “Channel Locations” within the
“Edit” option (Figure-3).

was extracted from the EEG data using the filter
command. Alpha range is referred to the brain wave when
a person was relaxed with minimal exertion of effort.
The power spectral density was processed using
the pwelch function from the signal processing toolbox
within the Matlab software [3]. Pwelch returns the power
spectral density (PSD) estimate of the input signal, found
using Welch's overlapped segment averaging estimator.
Hamming window was used in the pwelch function. An
example result of this process can be seen in Figure-4
below.

The mean values of each data channel needed to
be cleared as well before attempting to perform the
channel spectra and maps. This was done using the feature
“Remove baseline” within the “Tools” option.
Centering, filtering and power spectral estimations
Centering was processed using the MATLAB
software. The concept behind centering was by subtracting
the averaged value from each datum. Data with values
larger than the average would have positive values and the
value smaller than the average would have negative
values.
The EEG data was filtered of artifacts and noise
using the signal processing tool in Matlab software.
Besides that, only the alpha (8-13 Hz) frequency range

tabulated using Microsoft Excel (Table-3 and Table-4).
The peak values of each channel were used for
comparison.

From the Microsoft Excel, the data were analyzed
by seeking the peak values of each channel data.
Comparison between the channels situated on the left
hemisphere (odd numbered channels) of the scalp and
those located on the right hemisphere (even numbered
channels) of the scalp (Table-1) would be done. If the total
values of all the odd numbered channels is higher than the
total values of all the even numbered channels, it could be
concluded that higher brain activities were present on the
left hemisphere of the brain and vice versa.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Visual inspection with channel spectra and maps
From the visual inspection of channel spectra and
maps, it was discovered that when the left arm was raised,
three of the subjects recorded higher brain activities on the
right hemisphere of the brain. When the right arm was
raised, three of the subjects recorded a higher brain
activities on the left hemisphere. It was clear here that the
left hemisphere of the brain being more active when the

right arm was raised and vice versa. This trend was
summarized and can be seen in Table-2 below.
During the leg routine, the channel spectra and
maps showed that when the left leg was raised, there were
two subjects that showed more active brain activities on
the right hemisphere of the brain. There were also two
subjects that do not show a crisscross, meaning when the
left leg was raised, their left hemisphere of the brain were
also more active instead of the right hemisphere. It was the
same as well for the case when the right leg was raised,
there were two subjects that showed more brain activities
on their right hemisphere of the brain. This trend can be
seen in Table-2. It was not clear here whether there is a
definite crisscross of left brain corresponding with the
right leg movements and vice versa. There was a fifty
percent chance that when the subject raise either side of
his leg, either side of the brain could also be
As for the neck routine, it was discovered that
regardless of the direction that the subject turn his neck,
the left hemisphere of the brain was more active except for
once as seen in Table-2 below.

Tabulated data
From the Microsoft Excel tabulations (Table-3),
the following trends were observed as seen in Table-4 for
the arm routine, there were two subjects with right
hemisphere more active when the left arm was raised, yet
in the same event there were also two subjects with left
hemisphere more active. It can be concluded that there
was a fifty percent chance of either of the hemisphere of
the brain could be active in the event of one of the arm
was raised.
As for the leg routine from the data in Microsoft
Excel (Table-4), when the left leg was raised, there were
three subjects with more active right hemisphere brain

activities. Thus, when the right leg was raised, there were
also three subjects with more active left hemisphere brain
activities. It can be deduced that a clear indication of a
crisscross of left leg corresponding to the right hemisphere
of the brain and vice versa.
For the neck turned routine, it was observed that
when the neck was turned to the left (Table-4), there were
three subjects with left hemisphere of their brain more
active. Thus, when the neck was turned to the right, there
were also three subjects with right hemisphere of their
brain more active. It can be deduced that there was no
crisscross over the left turn of the neck with the right
hemisphere of the brain being more active and viceversa.

CONCLUSIONS
From the channel spectra and maps visual
inspection, it can be concluded that for the physical
movement of raising the arm, there was a crisscross in the
left hemisphere of the brain over the raising of right arm
and viceversa. As for the physical movement of raising the
leg, it was not clear whether there was a definite crisscross
of left brain corresponding with the right leg movements
and vice versa. There was a fifty percent chance that when
the subject raise either side of his leg, either side of the
brain could also be more active. As for the physical
movement of turning the neck, it was discovered that
regardless of the direction that the subject turn his neck,
the left hemisphere of the brain remained more active.
From the tabulated delimited text files in
Microsoft Excel, it can be concluded that for the physical
movement of raising the arm, it can be deduced that there
was a fifty percent chance of either of the hemisphere of
the brain could be active in the event of one of the arm
being raised. As for the physical movement of raising the
leg, it can be deduced that a clear indication of a crisscross

neck that was turned was also the same side of the brain
hemisphere that was more active. It can be deduced that
there was no crisscross over the left turn of the neck with
the right hemisphere of the brain being more active.
