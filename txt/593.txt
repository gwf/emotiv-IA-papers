TITLE:
Assessing brain activations associated with emotional regulation during virtual reality
mood induction procedures

ABSTRACT:
Emotional Regulation Strategies are used by people to influence their emotional
responses to external or internal emotional stimuli. The aim of this study is to evaluate
the brain activations that are associated with the application of two different emotional
regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) during virtual
reality mood induction procedures. We used Emotiv EPOC to measure the brain
electrical activity of participants while sadness is induced using a virtual reality
environment. We monitored 24 participants, who were distributed among three
experimental groups: a control group, a cognitive reappraisal group and an expressive
suppression group. In the control group, we found significant activations in several right
frontal regions that are related to the induction of negative emotions’. We also found
significant activations in the limbic, occipital, and parietal regions in the emotional
regulation groups. These regions are related to the application of emotional regulation
strategies. The results are consistent with those shown in the literature, which were
obtained through clinical neuroimaging systems.

1. INTRODUCTION

Emotional Regulation (ER) is a surging field of great interest for health sciences in
general and for psychology and education in particular. There are several reasons for
this, but one of the most important ones is the central role that emotions play in day-today living. In the words of Chambers et al. (2009), ER can be generally defined as “the
process of modulating one or more aspects of an emotional experience or response”.
This process has an impact on the intensity, duration, and expression of emotions (Gross
et al., 2007). ER is therefore considered to be an important factor influencing virtually
all aspects of life, including our physical and mental health, maintenance of social
relationships, and adaptation to new daily situations. This reinforces ER as a perfect
candidate in prevention measures for psychological problems. Numerous scientific
studies indicate that a lack of adequate ER is highly linked to the occurrence of
numerous mental and physical health problems, including borderline personality
disorders, depression (Ochsner et al., 2007), anxiety disorders, social interaction or
adaption problems, addictions, violent behavior, and other disruptive behaviors
(Davidson et al, 2000; Gross, 2002).
As Gross et al., 2007 defined in their “modal model” of emotion, the generation of
emotions is a special sequential process (situation-attention-appraisal-response) that
occurs over time. According to this “modal model”, many of the psychopathological
traits are due to deficiencies in one or more stages of these emotion-generative
processes. In other words, a psychopathological trait may be due to not knowing how to
change or select a situation, which could lead to a strong positive or negative emotion. It
may also be due to not being able to focus attention from emotionally harmful activities
to other less harmful activities. Finally, deficiencies or defects in the processes of
reevaluation of emotional situations or modulation of emotional responses to more
socially accepted ones are possible causes of psychopathological traits (Werner et al.,
2010). Therefore, adaptive ER is the selection and implementation of emotional
regulation strategies (ERS) that are adapted to the different stages of this emotiongenerative process, so that an emotional experience can be processed as a healthy
emotional experience (Mennin et al., 2007). These ERS could also provoke
simultaneous changes in cognitive and physiological processes (Chambers et al 2009).
Thus, the association between emotional regulation and personal adjustment, social
competence, and cognitive function suggests that the development of ERS has
significant personal consequences.
ERS enable people to influence the emotions they have, when they have them, how they
experience them, and how they express them. ERS can be automatic or controlled and
conscious or unconscious. ERS should be differentiated based on when they have their
first impact on the emotion-generation process. ERS are able of being involved at one or
more stages of this process. According to the model of emotion regulation presented by
Gross et al. (2003), ERS can either be antecedent-focused or response-focused.
Antecedent-focused strategies refer to the manipulation of the stages previous to the
creation of an emotion, which involves the selection and modification of the situation,
the control of attention deployment, and the cognitive reappraisal of the situation by
seeking to modify the emotional response before it manifests itself. In contrast,
response-focused strategies refer to the manipulation of the emotional response once it
has been generated (Chambers et al 2009). Both the physical and psychological
implications will be different depending on the strategy used.
Despite the fact that there are diverse ERS, in this study we focus on one antecedentfocused strategy (Cognitive Reappraisal) and one response-focused strategy,
3

(Expressive Suppression). Cognitive Reappraisal (CR) is a cognitive-linguistic strategy
that changes the trajectory of the emotional response by assigning a non-emotional
meaning to a situation. On the other hand, the Expressive Suppression (ES) is a strategy
that is directed towards inhibiting behaviors that are associated with emotional
responding (e.g., controlling facial expression or gestural response due to an emotion
(Goldin et al., 2008)). Numerous studies have identified the efficacy of CR strategies in
modulating and decreasing the impact of intense negative emotions without generating
high psychological and physiological responses (Chambers et al., 2009). In contrast, the
excessive use of ES strategies is linked to the appearance of emotional disorders, such
as depression (Gross et al., 2003).
Currently, there are tools based on new technologies that are starting to be applied to
train ER. For example, Playmancer (Moussa et al., 2009) is a European Project that
developed a system that was capable of multimodal emotional recognition. It combined
a serious game with virtual reality for ER training for the purpose of treating
psychological and behavioral disorders. Another project is REPLAY (Ibañez et al.,
2010), which evaluated ways of improving the emotional involvement and sense of
presence of the players in a virtual reality environment and training them in ER
strategies through the proper selection of content and use of exocentric avatar-based
interfaces and technologies, such as low-cost tracking.
Another way of training ER strategies is through the use of new interactive technologies
that allow having influence on certain aspects of the ER training process. This influence
can be achieved through Virtual Reality (VR). VR is a technology that allows us to
create environments where we can interact with any object in real time and that has
been widely used for training and learning purposes. The devices and techniques for
navigation and interaction through virtual experiences have improved greatly, thus
providing a more natural and motivating learning experience. Moreover, VR provides
benefits such as a high capability for immersion and persuasion. All of these features
allow us to use VR in studies of emotional evaluation and intervention. This is evident
in previous studies that have demonstrated the usefulness of VR in psychological
intervention for various psychological disorders such as claustrophobia (Botella et al.,
1998), fear of flying (Baños et al., 2002; Botella et al. 2004) or stress (Baños et al.,
2011).
In order to assess emotional regulation, we must have tools that allow us to evaluate and
assess the ERS that subjects apply in the context of emotional experiences. The
traditional methods that are used include subjective questionnaires, which ask the
patients about how they experience and manage their emotions. The Emotion
Regulation Checklist (Shields et al., 1997) and The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire
(Gross et al., 2003) are good examples of ER questionnaires. Although these
questionnaires have proven to be very useful, they have limitations that make them not
very suitable for certain groups that are especially reluctant to be assessed. Moreover,
when these questionnaires are used in combination with virtual environments, it may
only be possible to use them before or after the experience, but never during the virtual
exposure without interrupting it. The use of other kinds of techniques, such as
physiological measures, can help to overcome these limitations and complement the
information obtained with the questionnaires. Gross (1998b) analyzed the influence of
the application of ERS on heart rate during a stressful interview. The students that
applied an ERS showed a greater heart rate than the students that did not apply an ERS.
Campbell-Sills et al. (2006) compared the physiological effects of two ERS
4

(suppression and acceptance) in individuals with emotional disorders. This experiment
consisted in a negative emotional induction using a film clip while the subjects applied
one of the two strategies. It was observed that the acceptance group showed less
negative emotion than the suppression groups in the recovery period after the film.
Moreover, there was an increase in the heart rate of the suppression group, and a
decrease in the heart rate of the acceptance group.
Other tools that can be used to supplement the information supplied by traditional
methods are brain activity measures. Increasingly, affective studies are using brain
activity measures to improve understanding of the underlying mechanisms of affective
states. Brain activity can be assessed by means of different neuroimaging techniques,
such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or Positron Emission
Tomography (PET). Several neural structures that intervene in ER processes have been
identified using fMRI (Phillips et al., 2008). The majority of these structures were
localized in the limbic and frontal regions. The frontal region is reciprocally connected
with other subcortical limbic regions, which have an influence on the different steps of
the ER process (Stein et al., 2007). The prefrontal cortex (PFC), cingulate cortex, and
amygdala have been shown to have influence on the responses to emotional stimuli
(Johnstone et al., 2007; Wager et al., 2008; Ochsner et al., 2007).
More specifically, the neural structures involved in emotional processing form two
systems (the ventral emotion system and the dorsal emotion system) that have a role in
the decrease of negative emotions (Ertl et al., 2013). These structures form a complex
network that is responsible for processing responses to emotional events (Ochsner et al.,
2005). In turn, they involve the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, insula, hippocampus, and cingulate
cortex (Davidson, 2000; Ertl et al., 2013; Phillips et al., 2008; Ochsner et al., 2005;
Suveg et al., 2007). These neural networks play an important role during voluntary or
involuntary ER processes as well as in the support to brain regions that are involved in
cognitive processes (Phillips et al., 2008; Rubia et al., 2000; Marsh et al., 2006).
In spite of the fact that neuroimaging tools such as fMRI have many advantages
(including their high spatial resolution and their ability to detect sub-cortical areas)
these techniques do not offer a direct measurement of neural activity (Ertl et al., 2013)
and their use combined with navigation in VR imposes many restrictions. A
complementary tool to fMRI that has been used in many studies to evaluate brain
activity is the Electroencephalogram (EEG), which allows electrical brain activity to be
measured in a non-invasive way with a temporal resolution of milliseconds. This makes
it possible to analyze all of the fluctuations of the EEG signal that occur in subjects
when they are feeling an emotion.
The EEG is a technique that is easily combinable with virtual environments for ER
training since it does not impose restrictions on the virtual stimulus to be presented in
this study, as occurs with other neuroimaging techniques. In this regard, previous
studies consider the use of EEG to be a useful instrument for assessment in ER studies.
The important role of the prefrontal cortex for ER has been widely evaluated (Johnstone
et al. 2007; Wager et al., 2008; Ochsner et al., 2007). For example, Dennis et al. (2010)
observed that the increase of EEG frontal activity was linked to the effective
implementation of ER strategies during an emotional induction of sadness and fear.
An additional factor to be considered when evaluating the possibilities of combining
EEG monitoring with VR is the emergence of new portable EEG devices that allow
5

EEG signals to be captured wirelessly and in a more comfortable way. Since these EEG
devices are more portable, more ergonomic, less invasive, and more economical, they
provide an easy arrangement for emotional studies as well as a significant reduction in
cost and time. Emotiv EPOC (Zhang et al., 2010) is an example of a portable EEG
device that has recently been used in multi-disciplinary studies and whose effectiveness
has been tested (Khushaba et al., 2012; Khushaba et al., 2013). In previous studies, our
team analyzed the Emotiv EPOC signal that is measured during different immersion
experiences (Clemente et al., 2014) during a positive emotional induction with images
from the IAPS system (Rodriguez et al., 2013b) and during a negative mood induction
by means of a VR environment (Rodriguez et la., 2013a). This analysis demonstrated
the usability of these devices.
Based on these studies and the fact that the influence on brain activations of different
ERS applied during a virtual reality mood induction procedure has not yet been directly
evaluated, the goal of the present work is to compare brain activity at rest after the
application of different ERSs during a negative mood induction in a VR environment.
To do this we use a virtual park that was designed and validated for the induction of
sadness (Baños et al., 2006) as the virtual reality mood induction procedure in three
different experimental groups: the application of a CR strategy, the application of an ES
strategy, and the application of no ERS (the control group (CG)). We expect the sadness
induction to have an influence on brain areas that are related to the emotion of sadness
in the CG group. However, we expect to observe different activations in the CR and ES
group, which are related to the emotional regulation that has been applied and not to the
pure sadness induction. A wireless portable EEG device is used to evaluate the
differences in brain activity that are related to the ERS applied in each condition.

2. MATERIAL AND METHODS
2.1.Participants
For the study, 27 healthy participants (14 men and 13 women) participated voluntarily
in this experiment; they were divided into three groups of 9 participants each. Three
participants (one from every group) were excluded from the analyses due to poor
quality EEG recording, leaving a final sample size of 24 participants (12 men and 12
women). The participants were between the ages of 19 and 36 (M=23.36; SD=3.01). All
of the participants gave their informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study. All
of them had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The experiments were conducted in a
laboratory inside the LabHuman Institute.
In compliance with ethical guidelines, before beginning the study, an Inventory for
Measuring Depression (BDI) questionnaire was completed by the participants (Beck et
al., 1961). The BDI results were obtained immediately so that depressive participants
could be excluded (subjects with a score above 17). None of the participants were
excluded from the study (M=4.89, SD=4.022).

2.2.Instruments
6

Two types of instruments (psychological and physiological) were used in this study to
measure the participants’ experience during the exposure session.
2.2.1. Psychological Instruments
In order to evaluate their emotional states the participants had to complete two
questionnaires, the Visual-Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Positive and Negative Affect
Schedule (PANAS) before and after the EEG session.




The VAS questionnaire consists of a 7-point Likert scale that evaluates the current
emotional state of participants in terms of their level of joy, sadness, anxiety, and
relaxation. The measure was applied both before and after the virtual experimental
session (Gross et al., 1995).
The PANAS questionnaire consists of two 10-item scales that allow the positive
affect factor and the negative affect factor to be measured (Watson et al., 1988;
Watson et al., 1998). These factors are the most general ones that describe affective
experiences. They are calculated by adding the scores for positive items (PANASpositive) and negative items (PANAS-negative). The PANAS scale ranges from
slightly (1) to extremely (5) on a 5-point scale. This measure was applied both
before and after the virtual experimental session.

2.2.2. Physiological Instrument: Emotiv EPOC-based EEG data collection
The Emotiv EPOC is a low-cost EEG device that incorporates 14 channels of EEG data
and a gyroscope measure. The EEG channel names are based on the International 10-20
system and are located at the positions AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6,
F4, F8, and AF4 (Figure 1). Two electrodes located just above the participants’ ears
(CMR/DRL) are used as references, one for each hemisphere of the head. Internally,
Emotiv EPOC has a sample frequency of 2048 Hz which is down-sampled to 128 Hz
before transmitting to a computer via Bluetooth. Prior to use, all felt pads on top of the
sensor have to be moistened with a saline solution (Khushaba et al. 2012). The Emotiv
device was selected because of its low cost and portability, so the study could be
performed without any interference in the virtual environment.

2.3.Mood Induction

7

A virtual reality environment was designed to induce a negative mood (sadness) in the
participants. Brainstorm eStudio 11 software (Brainstorm Multimedia, Madrid, Spain)
was used as the graphic engine to create the virtual environment. The Python
programming language was chosen for its flexibility, which makes it suitable for the
purpose of this study.
This virtual environment was composed of a virtual park that has a natural and urban
atmosphere that would be easy to find in any real city. This park has trees, flowers,
water, urban furniture, a summer open-air cinema and a bandstand in the center (Figure
2). In order to induce a sad mood in the participants while they navigated through the
park, different traditional elements to induce emotions were included: music
(Sutherland et al., 1982), Velten self-statements (Velten, 1968) plus pictures (selected
from the International Affective Picture System IAPS, Lang et al., 2005) and a movie
(Gross et al., 1995). This virtual park had already been used in previous studies by our
group in order to show that virtual environments can be used as an effective moodinduction procedure (Baños et al., 2006).

Figure 2. Captures of the virtual environment

Before virtual navigation began, the participants had to listen to a short explanation
about the virtual emotional experience. A sad woman’s voice was used to guide the user
through the different sections of the park. At the beginning, the participants were asked
to freely explore the park while a piece of “Adagio for Strings-Choral” by Samuel
Barber was heard. After that, the voice asked them to go to the bandstand, where the
words in Velten statements appeared in random word order and the participants had to
put in the correct order to form a sentence. The contents of the statements were written
in the first person, such as: “Life seems sad and senseless to me”, “I make people
unhappy”, or “I have no future”. Then, the participants had to choose the picture that
best represented the meaning of the sentences from four options. This cycle was
repeated five times. The IAPS pictures included sad scenes such as children in combat
8

zones, drug addicts, or funerals. Finally, the participants navigated the virtual park
freely until the voice asked them to watch an excerpt of the movie “The Champ” in the
open-air cinema.
This virtual park was shown on a 4 x 2 meter retro-projected screen and the participants
were able to navigate through the environment using a wireless pad (Logitech Wingman
Cordless Rumblepad Gamepad; Logitech, Fremont, CA, USA) at a distance of 3.5 m
from the screen (Figure 3).

Figure 3. A participant navigating through the virtual park
2.4.Experimental Design
The experimental design for this study (Rey et al., 2012) is described below.
The participants spent approximately one hour in the laboratory and completed a series
of questionnaires before and after the exposure session. To evaluate pre- and postinduction sadness, the participants completed both the VAS and PANAS questionnaires
both at the beginning of the study and then again after the virtual mood induction
procedure.
Following the initial questionnaire period, the participants entered a dark room where
the mood induction was going to take place. Then, with the help of the researcher, the
participants had to practice how to move and interact with the environment in a
specifically designed training environment. Afterwards, an Emotiv EEG device was
placed on the participant’s head by the experimenter. The subjects were separated into
three experimental groups, each of which received instructions to apply a different
regulation strategy during the virtual exposure. These instructions were adapted to the
language and context of the study from the instructions used by Gross (1998a). The
Cognitive Reappraisal group (CR) received instructions to apply cognitive evaluation
strategies during the induction (i.e., the participants had to navigate through the virtual
environment carefully, but they had to reflect on what they were feeling with the
intention of applying to it a non-emotional meaning). The Expressive Suppression
group (ES) was told to control their expressive responses to the induced mood (i.e., the
9

participants had to control their external emotional responses to the virtual emotional
induction generated so that anyone who was watching the participants would not be able
to know their affective state). Finally, the CG did not receive any specific instructions to
regulate their emotions. The EEG device was synchronized with the experimenter’s
computer and the EEG data was recorded throughout the entire virtual exposure.
Before the virtual exposure, two minutes and thirty seconds of resting EEG activity
were recorded (BL1). Afterwards, the virtual induction of sadness started. At the end of
the virtual induction, two minutes and thirty second of resting EEG activity were
recorded again (BL2).
Finally, the participants were invited to watch a film to induce a positive mood in them
before finishing the experiment. The film used was an excerpt of the movie “Singing in
the Rain”.
2.5.Data Analysis
In order to compare the scores between the CG, CR, and ES groups regarding the
psychological information that was collected in the test questionnaires (VAS and
PANAS), a Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was applied. All of the analyses were
performed using the SPSS 17.0 application (IBM Corporation, Somers, New York,
USA) application with the significance level set at 0.05.
The EEG recordings were analyzed off-line using custom software written in MATLAB
R2011B (MathWorks, Inc). This software is based on the EEGLAB library (Delorme et
al., 2004), which provides many functions that can be used to pre-process and clear the
EEG-data. All the recorded EEG epochs were checked for artifacts (e.g.,
electrooculogram (EOG) and muscle (EMG) activity, eye blinks, electrical and baseline
noise).
The preprocessing of the recorded EEG was applied to the data corresponding to two
and a half minutes before starting the baseline study (BL1) and two and half minutes
after completing the virtual baseline study (BL2). The preprocessing of the EEG signal
started with a detrending removal to eliminate the DC offset in the EEG. This was
followed by a linear band pass filter (0,5-45 Hz) that removed the effect of the 50 Hz
noise and higher frequency artifacts (Khushaba et al., 2012; Kober et al., 2012;
Khushaba et al., 2013).
Then the EOG and EMG artifacts were detected and deleted using the ADJUST method
(Mognon et al., 2011), which is based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA).
ADJUST is a semi-automatic toolbox of EEGLAB that detects Independent
Components with possible artifacts generated by EOG or EMG and advises their
elimination. Other artifacts were removed manually using ICA analysis.
The activated brain areas were estimated through the sLORETA tools(standardized lowresolution electromagnetic tomography) (Frei et al., 2001; Pascual-Marqui et al., 1994;
Pascual-Marqui et al., 1999; Esslen et al., 2004). The sLORETA tools solve the EEG
inverse problem and localize the EEG activation source with a minimum low
localization error to within 1 voxel resolution on average (Pascual-Marqui et al., 2002;
Paquete et al. 2009). They also provide a realistic estimation of activation in the whole
brain in a standard 3D brain map. The whole brain was analyzed using voxel-wise t-test
to examine the difference between the BL1 and the BL2 condition for each group
10

individually on the theta and alpha bands. Then, the same voxel-wise t-tests were used
to compare the BL2 condition among the three groups. All of the analyses were
performed with the significance level set at 0.05.
3. RESULTS
3.1. Questionnaire Results
Post-hoc analyses based on Wilcoxon signed rank tests were performed on the VAS
variables (Joy, Sadness, Anxiety, and Relaxation) and the PANAS variables (PANASpositive and PANAS-negative) with significant level p<0.05. For the CG group, there
were no significant differences between the two conditions for any variables. For the
CR group, there were significant differences between the BL1 and BL2 conditions for
the VAS-joy (Z=2.232; p=0.026). For the ES group, there were significant differences
between the BL1 and BL2 conditions for the VAS-joy (Z=2.271; p=0.023), VASsadness (Z=-2.232; p=0.026) and PANAS-positive (Z=2.383; p=0.017). All of the
results are shown in Table 1.

condition in the right uncus (BA 20) and the right temporal lobe (BA 20), which
indicates decreased activity in these regions during the BL2 condition. However, in the
alpha band, power decreased in the BL2 condition in the frontal lobe (BA 47), which
indicates increased activity in these regions during the BL2 condition. Figure 4 shows
for the BL1>BL2 contrast in the theta band and the alpha band can be seen in All the
results for this contrast are shown in Table 2.

For the CR group, the same comparison between the BL1 and BL2 moments (again
using voxel-wise t-test for the theta and alpha bands) revealed several significant
differences in the theta band for p<0.05. Theta band power increased in the BL2 in the
cingulate Gyrus (BA 24) and the anterior cingulate (BA 33) for both hemispheres,
indicating increased activity in these regions after applying the cognitive reappraisal
strategy. Figure 5a shows comparison between the results for the BL1<BL2 contrast in
the theta band. All the results for this contrast are shown in Table 2.
However, even though we did not find any significant results for the ES group, we did
find several areas with a trend to significance. For the theta band and left hemisphere,
the ES group showed a higher activation (p>0.05) in several temporal areas as well as in
the precuneus (BA 19). The results for the ES group are shown in Figure 5b and
Table2.

Furthermore, the results obtained using the voxel-wise t-tests when comparing the BL2
condition between the CG and CR groups showed significant differences in several
areas in the theta band in the right hemisphere. In the CR group, theta power was
significantly higher on the lingual gyrus (BA 18), on the cuneus (BA 23) with p<0.01,
and significantly higher on the precuneus (BA 31) with p<0.05.This indicates
activations in these regions for the CR group. Figure 6 shows this comparison for the
BL2 condition. All of the results for this contrast are shown in Table 3.

4. DISCUSSION
This study evaluates the evolution of human brain activity when two different
Emotional Regulation Strategies (ERS) were applied during exposure to a virtual reality
(VR) environment that was designed to induce a sad mood. The use of an ERS based on
a cognitive-linguistic strategy (Cognitive Reappraisal, CR) and an emotional response
strategy (Expressive Suppression, ES) were compared with a Control Group (CG),
where only a sad mood was induced and no specific ERS was applied. The purpose was
study the changes in the brain activity due to the ERS applied using an Emotiv EPOC
headset. The main findings and their implications are discussed below.
The first hypothesis in the study assumed that the virtual environment would induce
sadness in participants and that this would be reflected in the brain areas related to the
emotion of sadness in the CG group. This hypothesis was confirmed.
We analyzed the subjective and objective results related to sadness induction in the
participants for the CG group. Even though the subjective VAS and PANAS
measurements did not show any significant results regarding the induction of sadness,
the EEG analysis showed evidence of a negative mood induction in the participants.
More specifically, the participants had a significant increase in brain activation in the
right inferior frontal gyrus and the right middle frontal gyrus for the alpha band.
According to Baumgartner et al. (2010), these frontal areas are a major part of a frontoparietal attention network, which works as a target detection and an alarm system to
new stimuli that could appear when we are engaged in other processes that need all of
our attention. Furthermore, the inferior frontal gyrus is also known to play an important
role in negative emotional processes such as sadness (Boyatzis et al., 2012). In this
respect, Vytal et al. (2010) showed a strong implication of the right inferior frontal
gyrus in sad emotions when they compared the brain activation of sadness and
happiness.
Apart from the activation in the alpha band, we have also found significant negative
activations in the right uncus (Limbic Lobe) and the right inferior temporal gyrus,
middle temporal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus. The activation in these right
temporal regions are normally related to the emotion of happiness. For example,
through a meta-analysis, Vytal et al. (2010), found a consistent activation of the right
superior temporal gyrus when happiness was compared with sadness, anger, fear, and
disgust. Killgore et al. (2004) showed a significant activation of the right inferior
temporal gyrus while the participants were looking at happy faces. Therefore, the
negative activations that were measured in the temporal lobe may be linked to a
decrease in happiness emotions when sadness was induced in the participants.

16

With regard to the negative activation in the right uncus, we know that the function of
the uncus in the parahippocampal gyrus plays an important role in the recognition of
scenes (Epstein et al., 1999) and the sense of presence (Clemente et al., 2014). We
hypothesize that this negative activation of the uncus could be linked with familiarity of
the virtual environment (Epstein et al., 1999). However, this hypothesis should be
studied in future works.
The results for first hypothesis indicate that a negative mood was induced in the
participants in the CG group when they navigated through the virtual park.
The second hypothesis assumed that the ERS would have brain activations in areas
related to the ER in the participants of the emotional regulation groups (CR and ES).
This hypothesis was partially confirmed for both of the emotional regulation groups.
For the CR group, we found significant activations for the theta band in the cingulate
gyrus and the anterior cingulate, which are both on the limbic lobe. This is a relevant
result because these areas play an important role in emotional regulation during active
reappraisal, (Ochsner et al., 2005; Kalisch et al., 2006), emotional stimulus processing
(Esslen et al. 2004, Bush et al., 2000), modulation of emotional responses to cues (Ray
et al., 2005; Phillips et al., 2003), and in other functions such as episodic memory
function (Paus et al., 1998) and learning and spatial attention (Baumgartner et al.,
2006). There are also studies where the increased activation of some parts of the
cingulate cortex has been used as a possible predictor for an antidepressant treatment
(Saxena et al., 2003). In this regard, a recent study (Smoski et al., 2013) provides
evidence that increased anterior cingulate activation could be related to an improvement
in emotional regulation functions in individuals that are recovered from an episode of
depression. This evidence would be close to our results, which would therefore suggest
that our participants were able to apply a CR strategy during the study.
On the other hand, the analysis of the brain activation in the ES group did not show any
significant results. Despite this, we found brain activations on the precuneus and the
angular gyrus in the participants during the application of the expressive suppression
strategy. These areas are known for being related to the sense of self-awareness or selfconsciousness (Kjaer et al., 2002; Lou et al., 2004) and the sense of presence and
navigation (Clemente et al., 2014). The brain activation of these areas could be linked to
the fact that the participants (who applied expressive suppression strategy) had to be
conscious of the negative perceived emotion in order to inhibit the external behaviors
that are associated with a possible emotional response.
The analyses of questionnaires showed results that were contradictory to those obtained
from the EEG for both emotional regulation groups. More specifically, the participants
had a significant decrease in the emotion of joy (VAS-joy) in both groups. There was a
significant increase in the emotion of sadness (VAS-sadness) in the ES group only. A
significant decrease in positive emotion (PANAS-positive) was also observed in the ES
group. In our opinion, the reason for the variations reflected in the subjective
measurements might be the difficulty of expressing a final emotion by means of
questionnaires when the participants performed a conscious emotional regulation
strategy. It seems logical for both positive and negative emotions were affected after
making the effort to apply an ERS to an emotional induction. This could therefore be
evidence of the subjectivity of these questionnaires when they are used in an ER study.

17

Finally, we analyzed the comparison between the brain activation due to ERS in the ER
groups (i.e., CR and ES groups), and the brain activation due to sadness induction in the
CG group.
Indeed, the comparison of BL2 between the CG and the CR groups showed a significant
activation (CG<CR) in the lingual gyrus and the cuneus (both on the occipital lobe) and
in the precuneus. According to the literature, the lingual, cuneus, and precuneus are
involved in the visual attention process (Mangun et al., 1998) and the cognitive
reappraisal process (Ziv et al., 2013). Therefore, the results suggest that these regions
were activated because the participants in the CR group applied an ERS based on
cognitive reappraisal.
The results of the comparison of BL2 between the CG group and the ES group showed
significantly higher activation (CG<ES) in the precuneus, superior parietal lobule,
cuneus, and a trend to significance in the cingulate gyrus for the ES group. According to
the literature, these areas play a role in spatial processing, mental rotation tasks and the
ego-centric view (Baumgartner et al., 2006, Jordan et al., 2004; Jordan et al., 2001;
Gron et al., 2000). Thus, the results obtained in our study could show that, in order not
to show any negative emotion, the participants in the ES group were aware of
everything that was going on around them.
The present study has some limitations. First, the number of participants in this work is
limited. The results should be confirmed with a large population of different age-range
and ethnicities. Then we could determine the impact of age and ethnicity on ER and
their impact on brain activations. Second, before starting the experimentation, we gave
the participants some instructions to help them perform their assigned ERS correctly.
Even though these instructions were clear and concise, some participants had difficulty
understanding them, which resulted in the need to spend more time explaining the
instructions to them. Perhaps it would have been desirable to perform a previous
training session for these ERS such as the one Ertl et al. (2013) conducted in their study.
This might have had a positive effect on the participants’ implication in the
experimentation and a positive effect on the perception and regulation of the induced
emotion and we might have had higher quality in the neural source localization. Third,
no clinic EEG devices were used in this study. Although one the goals of the study was
to evaluate the Emotiv EPOC headset in an ER study, it would be interesting to use a
professional EEG device with a higher number of electrodes in order to improve the
quality of the source localization. Finally, we used a VR environment to induce a
specific negative emotion. In the future it might also be worth exploring the scope for
inducing other types of emotions such as happiness or anger through VR environments
in order to evaluate the Emotiv EPOC headset in different situations.
5. CONCLUSIONS
In summary, the main goal of this study was to evaluate the brain activity due to the
application of two emotional regulation strategies when an emotion of sadness was
induced by a virtual environment. We measured the EEG signal using Emotiv EPOC
for three conditions: a sadness induction condition and two emotional regulation
conditions (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression). The results show
activation in several relevant brains regions that are associated with sadness induction
(for the CG group) and that are associated with the application of emotional regulation
strategies (for the CR and ES groups). The results were similar to those obtained in
previous studies. More precisely, we found activation in the right frontal areas for the
18

CG related to an induction of sadness (Baumgartner et al., 2010). We also found
significant activations in the cingulate, occipital, and parietal areas in the CR group
related to the application of a cognitive reappraisal strategy (Phillips et al., 2003; Ziv et
al., 2013). However, we did not find conclusive results for the ES group. In spite of the
fact that we found brain activations that could indicate that the participants complied
with the purpose of the condition and applied the ERS, we did not find any significant
activation to confirm this.
In addition, another key implication of this study (though was not an objective of this
work) is the fact that all of our findings were obtained through the processing of a
temporal measure that was obtained by a low-cost portable EEG tool. The results
achieved were similar to those obtained by complex neuroimaging systems. Therefore,
we consider that the Emotiv EPOC headset can be used in emotional regulation studies
as an objective evaluation tool. Previously, our team had evaluated the usability of the
Emotiv EPOC headset in the context of the sense of presence in virtual environment
(Clemente et al., 2014) and mood induction using emotional pictures (Rodriguez et al.
2013b) and virtual mood induction procedures (Rodríguez et al., 2013a). With the
results obtained in the present work, we have contributed to the evaluating of the
usability of the Emotiv EPOC headset in the field of emotional regulation.
This work will allow us to opens up a whole range of possibilities for research and work
in a new framework. Future works could evaluate other ways of training ERS based on
virtual reality or serious games in order to improve the use of classical ERS training
based on instructions. The impact of these new tools in the emotional regulation field
could also be evaluated in populations that are especially reluctant to be assessed, such
as adolescents. Virtual reality can be useful in improving the engagement of this
population in emotional health prevention and treatment programs. Finally, the use of
new tools to train different ERS applied to other emotions such as happiness or
frustration could also be analyzed in both clinical populations and non-clinical
populations.
