Abstract: The purpose of this document is to assess Electroencephalographic (EEG) signal frequency
dynamics in visual stimuli related to crime deterrence from an inexpensive device. The signals were
acquired from 4 participants, with an EMOTIV EPOC 14 channel EEG device, while visual stimuli
(deterrence and neutral) were presented, also an eye-tracking device was used to follow the participants
visual path through the images, the experimental design was developed in the Paradigm software and
the signal processing in Python using MNE for the EEG data analysis. Methods: The signal pass by a
preprocessing which includes filtering, denoising and ICA object rejection, then the Global Field
Power (GFP) is calculated to track the temporal dynamics of frequency bands theta, alpha, beta and
gamma, finally differential GFP for theta and alpha bands is calculated and maximal temporal
frequency responses are represented. The process applied shows dynamic characteristics of frequency
bands and allows maximal localization of its responses.

Although, those measures reveal part of our
psychological functioning, they have important
limitations that neurophysiological correlates have
proven to overcome [7]. Nowadays, researchers tend to
use behavioral and neurophysiological measures as a
complement [8]. Threat communication mainly based
on an arrangement of messages and emotional facial
expressions, alters cognitive processing and EEG
signals allow us to track in real time those changes in
the brain. Based on waves patterns observed and other
data as eye tracking movements it is possible to
discriminate differential effect of exposition to criminal
versus non-criminal groups.
Deterrence has been an influential approach into Police
worldwide in last two decades [9][10]. Currently,
Police force assumes that deterring effect could be even
higher if offender´s perception on punishment certainty
increases. Similar effect is expected in people at risk to
behave illegally [11][12] or citizens in general; results
which allows to police department preserving its size,
while it focusses on communications strategies that
change subjective probability of punishment certainty
[13]. This research aims at testing that assumption from

INTRODUCTION

T

his work is part of a larger research on criminal
behavior which purpose is to identify the
relationship between threat communication and
Perceived deterrence. Deterring individuals from
participating in illegal activity is the main purpose of
both criminal justice public policy and several parts of
criminal-justice system [1]. Deterrence has been
conceptualized from a criminological or an economic
tradition both with core concepts embedded in theories
of deterrence [1]: the principles of certainty, severity,
and celerity on punishment as well as the concept of
expected utility [2]. Nevertheless, considering that
every effective attempt to change people behavior
depends on public’s perceptions of the certainty,
severity, and celerity of punishment [3]; perceived
deterrence becomes a critical psychological variable at
any explanation model. Measuring perceived deterrence
and relating it to expected neurological reactions to
threat communication is a challenge in this research.
Measurement tradition in experimental psychology has
used reaction time, correctness of responses [4] forcedchoice tasks [5], and self-report formats [6] to obtain
information on behavior and cognitive processes.

criminology and engineering converge [14]; as a
Proactive policing’s effort [15] to improve our
understanding on how deterrence works.
Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals are interesting
objects to the brain’s study, since the first evidence of
electric current in the brain by Caton (1875), and the
first EEG record in humans by Berger (1929) arise a
race to understand its characteristics related to
pathologies, emotions, cognition, language, visual
imagery and even ways to use them as control signals
[16]. In particular for cognition various relationships
has been studied for certain frequency bands theta (θ) [4
Hz – 7 Hz], alpha (α) [7 Hz – 13 Hz], beta (β) [13 Hz –
30 Hz] and gamma (γ) [30 Hz – 100 Hz], as an example
Klimesch in [17] where α and θ ranges and the amount
of EEG power in their magnitudes -in an inverse
relationship- is associated to cognitive and memory
performance; or Van der Hiele who shows that an
increase in θ relative power and a decrease in α
reactivity, relates to worse neuropsychological test
performance in several cognitive domains [18].
Zaepffel who observed β power decrease during
movement preparation and execution of grasping and
increment around the start signal of the movement
ordered [19]. The neural basis of the relationships
between grouping, attention, memory and awareness
points to γ activity bended to physiological properties
of neurons and cognitive task synchronization [20].
Through brain intrinsic rhythms, typically in the 8 Hz –
40 Hz frequency, some of them related to periodic
activity of peripheral sensor and effector organs [21]
those relationships show how an understanding of
frequency dynamics on the EEG signals can be
significative.

the modified 10-20 system [8] with electrodes in AF3,
F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8,
AF4; The equipment has an acquisition rate of 128 d/s
and a resolution of 14 bits with a Least Significant Bit
value of 51µV, plus 2 default references channels CMS
(P3) as an absolute voltage reference and DRL (P4) as a
feedback cancellation system to emit the reference level
in the common mode of body potential [23]. The
communication from the device to the acquisition
computer is by means of wireless connectivity,
Bluethoot. The Emotiv-Testbench software allows to
save the EEG data in an EDF format, which can be
converted in a CSV file.
For the eye tracking data, the equipment used was the
Mobile Eye-5 eye tracking glasses, from ASL. The
Mobile Eye-5 has an acquisition rate of 30 d/s and 60
d/s, it can be used both as wireless and PC-direct
connection in its network interface, as an independent
device the data is stored in a SD card, [24]. The device
counts with 2 cameras, one for the eye with a 3
reflective pupil-cornea references, from a monocular
lent in the right eye; other camera for the scene, with
visual range of 60 degrees horizontal, 40 degrees
vertical and 0.5 degrees of accuracy, [25]. The device
returns: XY coordinates of the pupil and referenced
scene calibration pupil position, the pupil diameter,
time and marker stamps.

B. Software
•
Testbech, the proprietary software from
Emotiv company to adquire and save the EEG data, the
result is presented in an EDF file.
•
MNE-PYTHON, a specialized software for
MEG and EEG signal analysis, [26], along with various
PYTHON packages are used for the EEG data
processing and visualization.
•
Paradigm software for the stimuli presentation,
plus two libraries: Paradigm elements for ports, and
Paradigm elements for ASL in order to send
synchronous stimuli markers.

The approach here pretends to obtain the activity
dynamics for certain frequency bands, it is achieved by
means of the Global Field Power (GFP), which
corresponds to the spatial standard deviation of the
complete electrode field and usually is used to quantify
the activity magnitude[22], applied to the filtered signal
in the specific frequency bands, with a limit of 45 Hz
due to the EEG device characteristics

INSTRUMENTS AND SOFTWARE
The physical configuration of the system is shown in
the figure 1. There are two laptops, one EEG device,
one Eye-Tracker device and one switch. In laptop Pres
the Paradigm Software is installed to the stimuli
presentation and markers sending to both EyeTrack EEG devices due to synchronization of the stimuli. The
ASL device is connected interfacing the Eye Tracking

A. Instruments
For the acquisition of electroencephalographic signals,
a commercial and low-cost equipment, the Epoc, from
the Emotiv company has been used. This device
consists of 14 channels distributed approximately as in
392

glasses. The EEG laptop has the testbench software for
the acquisition of EEG data, the Emotiv Epoc connects
to it via Bluetooth. A switch element stablish a network
connection for all the systems.

electromyography (EMG), electrocardiography (ECG),
electrooculography (EOG) signals so the methodology
proposed for the preprocessing includes the
segmentation of data per individual and the stimuli
event space, by associating the event markers to the
EEG raw signal; Digital pass band filtering at 2.5 Hz
and 50 Hz for low driving and high frequencies noise of
electric origin removal, a finite impulse response filter
(FIR) is used due to easier shift compensation and
control [27] in the EEG signal, it is useful when the
base signal has finite duration, as EEG is related to
finite neuron potential combination. The power spectral
density of the filtered signals is shown in Figure 3.

Fig. 1. Setup for the stimuli presentation, EEG and
Eye-Tracking data acquisition.
The experimental imaging task begins with a neutral
image followed by a visual deterrent, this happens
repeatedly, with 30 different marked visual deterrents,
each with 6 seconds duration; the set of images is
randomized for each participant in the Figure 2 there is
an example of the used material sequence. Minimum
movement of the participants is required and measured
by means of the EEG accelerometers an gyros.

Fig. 3. Power spectral density plot of passband filtered
signal between 2.5 Hz and 50 Hz.
Artifact removal by infomax independent component
analysis (ICA) extraction (EOG, EMG, ECG) is applied
due to its reliability in non-EEG artifact rejection
[28][29].
ICA in signal processing is a technique to find a matrix
W and a vector w for the signal transformation x where
the transformation
has statistically
independent elements in
[30][31]. Usually x comes from a source collection
where all the signals interact between them, the ICA
can approximate the value of the independent sources,
including those no related or noisy.

Fig. 2. Samples of neutral and deterrent visuals,
where each experimental stimuli has a marker and lasts
6 seconds.

Figure 3 shows the 14 components obtained; the
components closely related to EOG and EMG are
selected as noisy references for recalculating the signal,
the criteria, for maintaining the most of EEG

IV. PREPROCESING
Acquired signals of EEG usually contains other sources
which are not related to brain behavior such as related

information, includes bad channel and lapse rejection
(just if needed) [32], for the 4 participants cases ICA
was sufficient for EOG and EMG rejection. The Figure
4 shows a sample of the ICA maps for the 14
components and Figure 5 shows a EOG noise
component in this case ICA001 and average result

(GFP)

To obtain specific band frequency dynamics for bands θ
[4 Hz – 7 Hz], α [7 Hz – 13 Hz], β [13 Hz – 30 Hz] and
γ [30 Hz – 45 Hz], a FIR passband filter is applied,
next the GFP is calculated as (1) in [33] and [34] over
the complete electrode field for the filtered bands:

Where GFP_B is the GFP for the band B , N is
the number of electrodes, in the Figure 6, band
frequency GFPs plots of the 4 bands for neutral –
deterrent stimuli.

time projection of isolated components (down).

Fig. 6. GFP for α,β,θ and γ bands, the zero position
indicates the deterrent image start, waves from
participant 2.
Different response are observed for each
participant, for example in Figure 1 participant 2 shows
a stronger response of θ and α waves, but for participant
4, in Fig. 7, α,β are stronger.
Dynamics for the frequency bands are achieved but for
instance some relationship between those dynamics can
be important for psychological evaluation of the
response to a deterrent stimuli, as such a differential of
θ and α waves, cognition related [17][18] is presented
in Figure 8, as some peaks of the differential field
obtained.

After preprocessing the signal should contain EEG the

VI. CONCLUSIONS
The developed process achieves showing important
characteristics of frequency bands temporal dynamics
introduced in visual stimuli, by means of the GFP and
operable comparitions of GFPs. The methodology to
assess frequency dynamics is achieved and can be
applied to study some characteristics of frequency
bands over time, event taking into account differential
dynamics important for cognition or others brain
functions. Critical steps are presented in the EEG
preprocessing, more specific in the ICA application due
to criteria application for reject noisy component
without compromising the brain signal activity.

Those same peaks can be observed over the raw signal,
with their respective topomaps in the Figure 9. A
forward study will compare cognition activity related
deterrence while deterrent stimuli is presented.
The process to follow could be represented like in
Figure 10, where preprocessing, frequency band
segmentation, event segmentation, GFP calculation and
GFP differential applications achieve the proposed
objective for assessing frequency dynamics of EEG
signals.
