A variety of assessment tools are currently available to help clinicians assess Sports
Related Concussion (SRC). Currently, the most widely available tools are neither
objective nor portable, and are therefore not ideal for assessment at the site and time
of a suspected injury. A portable system was developed to deliver a measurement of
the steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP). This system involved a smartphone
housed in a Google Cardboard frame, which delivered a 15-Hz flicker visual stimulus
while an electroencephalography (EEG) headset recorded EEG signals. Sixty-five rugby
union players were tested during their regular season and were stratified into healthy,
concussed, and recovered groups based on clinical examination. Their SSVEP response
was quantified into a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The SNRs of players in each study
group were summarized. Additionally, the SNRs of individual players who had baseline,
post-injury, and post-recovery readings were analyzed. Sixty-five participants completed
a baseline evaluation to measure their SSVEP. Twelve of these participants sustained
a medically diagnosed concussion and completed SSVEP re-testing within 72 h.
Eight concussed players received follow-up SSVEP testing after recovery. Concussed
participants had a lower SNR [2.20 (2.04–2.38)] when compared to their baseline
[4.54 (3.79–5.10)]. When clinically recovered, participant SNR was not significantly
different to their baseline [4.82 (4.13–5.18)]. The baseline SNRs of the players who
experienced a concussion during the season were not different to those of players who
did not experience a concussion [4.80 (4.07–5.68)]. This is the first study to identify
differences in SSVEP responses in male amateur rugby union players with and without
concussion. It is also the first SSVEP demonstration for concussion evaluation at pointof-care. SSVEPs are significantly attenuated in the presence of concussion in these male
athletes. Individuals returned to their baseline SSVEP following clinical recovery from the
concussive injury. The use of SSVEPs has the potential to be a supplemental aid for the
assessment and management of concussion.

SSVEPs as a Biomarker for Concussion

following a concussion (Freed and Hellerstein, 1997; Boutin et al.,
2008), with studies showing signal abnormalities or significant
attenuation in study participants following the diagnosis of a
concussion (Freed and Hellerstein, 1997; Moore et al., 2014;
Yadav and Ciuffreda, 2015; Poltavski et al., 2017). Thus, VEPs may
be a useful objective biomarker of concussion.
There are several advantages of using SSVEPs compared with
conventional VEPs such as: (1) lack of synchronicity between
EEG recorder and visual stimulus (simplifying equipment
requirements), (2) relative resistance to noise artifacts, and (3)
improved resilience to variable contact impedance (Peterson
et al., 2014; Dreyer and Herrmann, 2015; Norcia et al., 2015).
These advantages make SSVEPs a favorable brain signal to study
in non-clinical environments such as on the sideline of sports
grounds and in a doctor’s office. The goal of this study was to
investigate potential differences in SSVEPs that were recorded
from athletes who were assessed by an experienced sports doctor
as healthy, concussed, or recovered from a recent concussion.

INTRODUCTION
Sports-related concussion (SRC) is defined by the Concussion in
Sport Group as “immediate and transient symptoms immediately
following a mild traumatic brain injury occasioned during sport”
(McCrory et al., 2017). SRC is caused by a direct force delivered to
the head or anywhere else on the body which results in impulsive
force being transmitted to the brain (McCrory et al., 2017). In
some cases, signs and symptoms evolve over a number of minutes
to hours, and in most cases resolve spontaneously by 7–10 days
(Graham et al., 2014) provided the individual is not exposed to
further impacts.
Concussion is a common injury in contact sports, with an
incidence rate of approximately 1 per 1,000 athletic exposures
in the NFL (Kilcoyne et al., 2014), and up to 4 concussions
per 1,000 player-match-hours in elite rugby union (Gardner
et al., 2014; Fuller et al., 2015). The increasing awareness of
concussion has motivated sports governing bodies to implement
protocols to improve player safety (Partridge and Hall, 2015).
The most pressing issues in relation to concussion involve
accurate and timely diagnosis, and safe return-to-play criteria
(Graham et al., 2014; Levin and Diaz-Arrastia, 2015; Murray
et al., 2015). Athletes may minimize or deny symptoms
to avoid a concussion diagnosis and accelerate their return
to play, potentially increasing the risk of Second Impact
Syndrome (Bey and Ostick, 2009). Over long periods, repeated
and inappropriately managed concussion may lead to chronic
neurological impairment and the possibility of chronic traumatic
encephalopathy (CTE; Arciniegas, 2011; Stern et al., 2011;
Weinstein et al., 2013).
The most commonly used concussion assessment tool is
the multi-modal Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT;
Echemendia et al., 2017b) which incorporates cognitive
assessment, symptom reporting, physical examination,
coordination, and balance testing (Giza et al., 2013). Other
computerized neurocognitive tests (CNT) require active
participation from the participant and thus are influenced
by participant motivation and effort, prone to ceiling effects
(Echemendia et al., 2017a) and suffer poor reliability (Ragan et al.,
2009; Echemendia et al., 2017a). Moreover, these assessment
tools are vulnerable to manipulation by athletes despite checks
built into tests like the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment
Tool (ImPACT; Alsalaheen et al., 2016). Symptom reporting is
also subjective and unreliable.
Due to the limitations of existing tests and the growing
realization of the significance of the condition, there is a critical
need for an objective biomarker of SRC that can be rapidly
applied to athletes, ideally at the point of occurrence. The
steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP) is an objective,
quantifiable fluctuation of electrical activity that occurs in the
brain in response to a specific set of visual stimuli, and is
measurable using EEG technology (Phurailatpam, 2014; Kothari
et al., 2016). Since the discovery of the SSVEP in the 1950s, it has
become an important tool for understanding the relationships
between physical stimuli, brain activity, and human cognition
(Galloway, 1990; Handy, 2005; Luck and Kappenman, 2011).
There is emerging evidence that VEPs are chronically impaired

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A prospective cohort observational study was undertaken over
a season of rugby union practice and match activities. The
South Eastern Sydney Local Health District human research
ethics committee approved all procedures in the study [South
East Sydney Local Health District HREC ref no: 17/039
(HREC/17/POWH/91)], and all players provided informed
written consent prior to participation.

Participants
Healthy members of a male amateur community rugby union
team competing in a premier grade club tournament were
recruited to participate in the study. Player screening was
undertaken to identify any relevant exclusion criteria, and
for history of recent concussion (Figure 1). Exclusion criteria
included a diagnosis or symptoms of epilepsy, existing and/or
previous brain injury, or legal blindness. Testing was performed
prior to practice sessions during the regular competition season
over 18 weeks in a quiet setting.

SSVEP Testing Protocol
The visual stimulus used for this study (Figure 2A) was displayed
to participants using a Sony Xperia Z1 smartphone playing a
MP4 video file which lasts for 30 s. The smartphone was placed
in a Google Cardboard frame and the participant held this
to their head centered over the bridge of the nose covering
both eyes. The Google Cardboard housing for the smartphone
provided a consistent eye distance to the visual stimulus on
each individual tested as it is non-adjustable. The MP4 video
comprised a sequence of black and white screens alternating at
a frequency of 15 Hz. This frequency was chosen as it falls within
the ideal SSVEP frequency range (between 10 and 20 Hz) (Kuś
et al., 2013) while also having a 50% duty cycle on the display
(i.e. two frames bright, two frames dark). A number was placed
in the middle of the screen (occupying <2% of the screen with
a visual angle of 1.5◦ ) to allow participants to focus centrally to

maximize participant concentration and field of view covered by
the stimulus. This number changed at 5 s intervals to encourage
sustained attention. All participants were asked to confirm that
they could see the fixation target with both eyes prior to testing.
The EEG recordings were measured with an Emotiv EPOC+,
a wireless, 14-channel EEG headset. The electrodes were arranged
according to the International 10–20 system (Figure 2B; Handy,
2005; Luck and Kappenman, 2011). The O1 and O2 electrodes
were used as the main recording electrodes and the P3 and
P4 electrodes were utilized as the reference and common-mode
electrodes, respectively (these were non-reconfigurable factory
settings). Data were sampled at 128 Hz and wirelessly transferred

to a laptop computer via the Emotiv Xavier software (v3.1.21) as
a European Data Format (EDF) file.
The captured EDF file data were imported into MATLAB
2015b. The entire 30-s recording was used as the analysis
window for calculation of the frequency response. A bandpass Butterworth filter with corner frequencies at 5 and 40 Hz
was applied to minimize lower-frequency noise, DC voltage
offset and mains power. A Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT)
was then applied to generate a power spectrum density (Liu
et al., 2012). Channels O1 and O2 were summed to generate
a single plot. The magnitude at 15 Hz was divided by the
average magnitude between 5 and 40 Hz to establish the

clinical experience in assessing sports-related injuries and
approved by Rugby Australia for competency in providing
immediate care in sport.
After witnessing an impact on the field suggestive of
compromising the player, having one reported to him by a
team official or player, or at the request of an individual
player, the team doctor performed an assessment based on
elements of the SCAT (Echemendia et al., 2017b). This included
questioning of the player regarding orientation in time, place and
person, memory of the events, as well as common symptoms
of concussion, e.g. headache, nausea, dizziness and balance
problems, blurred vision/visual disturbances, confusion, or a
feeling of slowness or fatigue. A physical examination was also
conducted including evaluation of the central and peripheral
nervous system. Diagnosis of concussion was made based on
this assessment in association with background knowledge of the
player’s typical demeanor and behavior.
Re-assessment by the same team physician occurred within
48 h and again several times during non-contact practice
following Rugby Australia’s Graduated Return to Play (GRTP)
guidelines (Rugby Australia, 2018), and again before returning to
full-contact practice (minimum 12 days post-injury).

magnitude ratio (signal-to-noise ratio or SNR). The SNR was
utilized for comparison purposes across the different groups.
Each participant underwent the SSVEP assessment protocol twice
in succession on each testing occasion; the second reading from
the two assessments was selected for comparison as it consistently
yielded a clearer SNR.
To ensure an adequate connection between the headset and
the participant’s head, the Emotiv TestBench software’s contact
quality indicator was checked before the test was undertaken. The
headset housing the smartphone was provided to the participant;
they were instructed to hold it up to their eyes and stare at the
number at the center of the screen. The test was then repeated.
Prior to the competition season, all enrolled players
underwent a baseline SSVEP assessment. All retests (whether for
test–retest reliability or post-injury) were performed prior to the
practice session which occurred 2 days after a competition game.
Following a medically diagnosed concussion, an SSVEP
reading was acquired within 2 days of injury to assess for
any change. Concussed participants were also reassessed 7–
14 days after the event for their “recovered” reading once deemed
recovered by the team physician.

Through the course of the rugby season, 12 participants sustained
a concussion that was diagnosed by the team physician and
had a second SSVEP assessment. All 12 concussed participants
recovered clinically: eight of these were available for further
SSVEP assessment, the other four were lost to follow-up.
Overall, the median SNR for all 65 players was 4.80
[interquartile range (IQR): 4.07–5.68]. For the 12 concussed
players, the median SNR was 2.00 (IQR: 1.40–2.32). For the
eight recovered players who were available for a further SSVEP
assessment, the median SNR was 4.82 (IQR: 4.13–5.18) (Table 1
and Figure 3).
Changes were observed in the stimulus response strength
(SNR) in the identified concussed participants when compared
to their baseline [2.00 (95% CI: 1.83–2.16) vs. 5.01 (4.78–5.24);
p < 0.0001] (Table 1 and Figure 4). The eight players who were
re-evaluated after recovery had an increased SNR compared to
their concussed SSVEP (Table 2).
Twenty-two players who were not concussed were retested
over the season: the remaining players were lost to follow-up.
The ICC between the first and second tests for non-concussed
participants was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.79–0.96) (Table 3). Mean time
between testing was 31.91 ± 11.22 days for players that did not
sustain a concussion.

to be normally distributed (baseline W = 0.97; p = 0.2902,
concussed W = 0.96; p = 0.4154, recovered W = 0.90; p = 0.5987).
Paired two-tailed t-tests were performed for players who had all
three readings (t-tests performed between baseline–concussed,
baseline–recovered) and a Bonferroni correction was applied
to account for multiple comparisons. Test–retest reliability was
estimated using an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), with
95% confidence intervals (CIs), to examine agreement between
baseline and repeated testing throughout the season. Cohen’s
effect size (d) was used to calculate practically meaningful
differences between baseline, concussed, and recovered. Effect
sizes of <0.19, 0.20–0.60, 0.61–1.20, and >1.20 were considered
trivial, small, moderate, and large, respectively (Yadav and
Ciuffreda, 2015). All summarized data are expressed as medians
with 25th to 75th interquartile range. Statistical significance level
was set at α = 0.05.

DISCUSSION
This is the first study to identify differences in SSVEP response
in healthy active male amateur rugby union players when
concussed, and the first study to demonstrate the use of SSVEP
at point-of-care. This makes it an important step to a potential
objective biomarker of concussion. In addition, the fact that an
SSVEP is logistically easier to acquire than a VEP makes the goal
of a simple sideline assessment more realistic. The study also
demonstrated a return to pre-concussion SSVEP values following
clinical recovery. High test–retest reliability in non-concussed
participants highlights the stability of the measurement, even
when the repeated testing was conducted several weeks apart.
Previous studies have noted that conventional VEPs are
altered by the presence of concussion (Freed and Hellerstein,
1997; Moore et al., 2014; Yadav and Ciuffreda, 2015). In
these studies, the main findings demonstrate attenuated or

Several limitations to this study were noted. The background
EEG noise was variable even among the same individuals tested
again immediately after their first test. Possible reasons were
hypothesized to be the cause: (1) poor impedance control (as the
system did not feedback the actual impedance values) and (2)
variable visual focus during tests due to fatigue or distractions.
Although the Epoc+ is sufficiently accurate to capture SSVEPs
(Liu et al., 2012), correlation with results from other EEG

delayed VEP responses. This is consistent with our findings
that the SSVEP was attenuated in the presence of concussion.
Furthermore, our study builds on the existing literature by
showing differences in SSVEP in baseline, concussed, and
recovered individuals as opposed to control and injured cohorts.
As previously noted, diagnosis of concussion that relies on
subjective criteria is far from ideal. Radiological modalities
such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed
tomography (CT) provide information about macroscopic
structural injuries (Slobounov and Sebastianelli, 2014).
Concussion is not a macroscopic structural injury; therefore,
these modalities are primarily used to rule out injuries such
as hemorrhage (Graham et al., 2014). As neurophysiological
biomarkers, VEP (and SSVEP) assesses function rather than
structural integrity (Drislane, 2007). The changes in the SSVEP
response found in our concussed participants likely represent a
disruption of neuronal function. Whether this is due to primary
(e.g. damaged white matter) or secondary phenomena (such
as inflammatory response) is yet to be established, and further
studies are recommended to explore this.

SSVEPs as a Biomarker for Concussion

equipment may provide a deeper insight into whether these
variances are naturally occurring, or a shortcoming of the
current equipment. In most participants the second SSVEP SNR
was larger than the first. This may be due to familiarization
with the process and less blinking during repeat stimulus
presentation. Further studies are needed to determine if there is a
familiarization effect to the SSVEP protocol.
Further research is required to better understand mechanisms
underlying our finding that SSVEPs attenuate in concussion,
but this study provides pilot evidence for an objective measure
of concussion that is able to be delivered expediently on the
sideline. This has the potential to provide significant benefit
to medical professionals and coaches, as well as athletes and
their families. As this study only assessed 65 players, 12 of
whom suffered a concussion, studies with larger sample sizes
will assist to evaluate the robustness of the SSVEP in the
practical assessment of concussion, particularly its sensitivity
and specificity. Additionally, experimentation with different
parameters such as varying stimuli time and frequencies on both
concussed and non-concussed individuals may be explored in the
future to further validate the use SSVEPs in this application.

DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT

CONCLUSION

FUNDING

In conclusion, SSVEPs offer new potential in the assessment of
concussion, by non-invasively and objectively measuring brain
function. This study determined that SSVEPs are significantly
attenuated in the presence of concussion in male athletes. It
also shows that individuals return to their baseline SSVEP
following recovery from the concussive injury. The use of SSVEPs
has the potential to be a supplemental aid for the assessment
of concussion. Further studies with larger cohorts, as well as
comparing SSVEPs to other methods of concussion diagnosis will
be necessary to fully understand the potential of this technique.
