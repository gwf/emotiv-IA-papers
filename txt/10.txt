Introduction
More and more attention has been
recently paid to the theory and practice of
developing neurocomputer interfaces
which use registered brain activity to
create
and
send
commands
to
anexternaldevice using reliable and safe
method
of
electroencephalography
(EEG).
A neurocomputer interface is a device
which permits its user to communicate,
sending brain signals to external
surroundings directly, without any
intermediate sign system, such as speech
or movements.
Nowadays neurocomputer interfaces
are applied not only for medical purposes,
where their use is quite important, but
also in different kinds of industry, such as
safety
equipment
production,
entertainment industry, education and
staff management.
It is obvious that the development of
neurocommunication
technologies
permits to use portable and cheap medical
equipment, doing this technology much
more available. But along with this
recently in response to the market
demands there has been developed a new
type of neurocomputer interfaces which
can be used not only outside medical
laboratories, but by users without special
training. This type of devices is
represented by NeuroSky, MindFlex,
Emotiv EPOC [Stamps et al., 2010].
At the moment the main task in
developing the devices is testing them on
the easiest operations, such as games. The
problem, however, is that such tests don’t
always reveal if the devices are
acceptable for scientific studies.
This article is describing the
experiment with the useof BCIEmotiv
EPOC for simple linguistic studies.
The Approach Based on the Evoked
Potentials P300 Analysis

The
classical
way
of
electrophysiological studies of brain processes
is the evoked potentials P300 method,
more than once described in scientific
literature (for example, [Pritchard et al.,
1981]). The method is based on
registration of the evoked brain electric
activity in response to an external
stimulus or in response to some brain
event, related to recognition, expectation,
making decisions, initiation of a motor
reaction. As it has been pointed out (for
example,in [Patel et al., 2005]), P300 is
only a part of a complicated potential
appearing as a result of focusing a
subject’s attention in the course of
performing a cognitive task. The process
of detecting of a meaningful stimulus
includes only sensory part, related to
physical characteristics which are mainly
reflected in the indicators of early
components of evoked potential. The next
task is the initial recognition and
classification of stimuli, which is
demonstrated essentially by the negative
fluctuation (marked as N2, N200) in
approximately 96-250 ms after the start
of the stimulus. Then there is final
stimulus recognition, which demands
comparing it to the examples in the
subject’s memory and making decision
about the subsequent action. P300
isrelatedtotheseveryevents.
P300 is usually received using so
called P300-speller, which is included in
the Emotiv EPOC complete set.This
detector is a matrix with 36 cells, where
numeric and alphabetic symbols can be
used, the symbols are highlighted by
flashes in random order, and a subject
watches the succession of flashes.
According to the instruction the subject
concentrates on one symbol, and when
the targeted cell (containing this very
symbol) is highlighted, the speller
registers the brain reaction for this
stimulus. For training the speller this
procedure is repeated several times. In the

102

Advances in Social Science, Education and Humanities Research (ASSEHR), volume 122

end the average EEG signal for targeted
cells is compared to the average signal for
non-targeted cells (on which the subject
didn’t concentrate their attention).
One can expect that targeted cells
signals will have the characteristics of
evoked potentials, and non-targeted cells
signals will appear as random noise. At
least, this is the ideal picture; in reality,
however, non-filtered EEG artefacts can
considerably influence the received
evoked potentials signals.
In order to test the dependence of
P300-speller functioning quality the
matrix was completed with Russian
alphabetic symbols. It was assumed that
the degree of the speller training will
improve if the subject sees their native
(Russian,Cyrillic) symbols instead of
Latin ones.
The Description of the Experiment
The procedure recommended in the
Emotiv EPOC manual was used for the
experiment. The data was received for
one subject. It is a man 32 years old, with
higher education, right handed, without
physical disabilities. For getting visual
stimuli there was used free software
designed for the experiments with evoked
potentials P300 – OpenVibe version
1.1.0. The duration of flashes and periods
between flashes was 125 ms. Brain
signals were registered by Emotiv EPOC
Research Edition. The received data was
filtered with bandwidth 1 – 20 Hz. And
then the program EEGLAB7.1.was
applied.
The connection quality between
Emotiv EPOC and OpenVibe software
was previously tested with the use of the
built-in module p300-speller-0-signalmonitoring.xml. Then the P300 speller
was trained with the use of standard
modules p300-speller-1-acquisition.xml
(the matrix with Latin symbols), p300speller-2-train-xDAWN.xml and p300-

speller-3-train-classifier.xml.
The
evaluation of the precision of the trained
classifier was then made: the subject was
asked to fix his stare on letters and
numbers; if the program recognized the
symbol it was highlighted green, if it
recognized the line or the column it was
highlighted orange, symbolsrecognized
incorrectlywere highlighted black. After
the training the precision of the speller
was 70.87%.
In the next step the P300 speller was
trained with Russian alphabetic symbols.
After this training the evaluated precision
degree for the OpenVibe classifier was
higher: the comparison showed that the
final result for the recognition of the
symbols of the Russian letters matrix was
83.45%.
The next stage of the study was
detection and localization of the brain
electric activity source significant for
operating Emotiv EPOC during the
performing of the assigned cognitive
operation. For it the data received from
the device was processed with
EEGLAB7.1 software.
In the first step of the analysis the task
was to separate the received EEG signals,
detecting the signals of different brain
electric activity sources, as the Emotiv
EPOC sensors register the data set
generated by a lot of various sources.
This task was solved by the ICA
(Independent
component
analysis)
method
[Comon
et
al.,
2010],
recommended by Lee Te-Won,A.J., Bell
and T.J.Sejnowskias the standard method
to solve the blind source separation
problem[Lee Te-Won et al., 2000].This
method permits to separate the observed
electric
signals
into
independent
components generated by different brain
structures which have a certain fixed
localization each. After the application of
theBasicFIR,
RemoveBaselineand
RunICA filters it became clear that the
main brain electric activity source during

103

the performing of the experimental task
was the point F4 in the right frontal lobe.
The Results

Survey // Proceedings of the 2010
International Conference on Brain
Informatics, ser. BI'10. BerlinHeidelberg: Springer-Verlag, 2010. P.
336 – 345.

The results of the experiment demonstrate
that the neurocomputer interfaceEmotiv
EPOC permits to detect the significant
brain signals, and the signal detection
quality depends on belonging of the
presented symbols to a native subject’s
language or a familiar, but non-native
one, in other words, on the frequency of
the appearance of similar stimuli in
subjects’ everyday experience. The noise
level in received signals can be
diminished by application of the
averaging and filtration techniques.
However, one should bear in mind that
the signal detection precision isn’t as high
as for professional medical EEG
equipment. So, Emotiv EPOC can be
used for solving not quality critical tasks.
