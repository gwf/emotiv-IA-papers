Abstract. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a very attractive area and common trend worldwide. The
electroencephalographic (EEG) technology is being used by BCI systems that process brain signals through
computer algorithms. EEG-based BCI has become an important tool for real-time analysis of brain activity.
This article examines the usability and quality of the signals recorded using the Emotiv device. To examine
brain activity, visual and auditory stimuli were presented to the subjects and responses was observed using
wireless noninvasive EEG device Emotiv Insight. To measure signals the free version of software Emotiv
Xavier ControlPanel was used. The results demonstrated that the Emotiv Insight device is suitable for
entertainment.

1 Introduction
The BCI can be defined as a system that translates the
brain activity patterns of a user into messages or
commands for an interactive application. This activity is
measured and processed by the system. The BCI user’s
brain activity is measured using electroencephalography
(EEG) here. [1] EEG is a record of changes in neuronal
polarization and neuroglia in the CNS (central nervous
system) during the time. Surface electrodes detect
changes in neuronal polarization. It is about bioelectric
manifestations of brain processes and responses to
external stimuli (visual and auditory). Visual stimuli are
reactions to stroboscope flash, chessboard, and images.
Auditory stimuli are reactions to sounds, tones, and
music. Detections can be categorized into cognitive,
expressive and affective. Here affective detections are
used. Affective input signals are signals sent by the brain
based on emotion or meditation. A method is provided for
individuals to interact with a computer via emotions and
without need to move.
Advances in brain science and computer technology in
the past decade have led to significant developments in
BCI. Recent technological advances such as wireless
recording, low-cost amplifiers, real-time temporal
resolution, machine learning analysis, and advanced
signal analysis methodology, showed that the EEG-based
BCI systems are more accessible to researchers in many
scientific domains. The basic division of BCI systems is
invasive and non-invasive. Currently, there is a high level
of interest in noninvasive BCI technology. The portable
EEG headset helps to understand the brain dynamics
underlying integration of perceptual functions of the brain
*

in different scenarios. Here wearable and wireless EEG
headset Emotiv Insight is used. [2]
Currently, plenty of BCI applications in different
research sectors already exist (medicine, communication
and control, entertainment, rehabilitation, assistive
technology, training, and other). [3]
BCI connects the outside world, in real time, like
biological communication system. It facilitates the
communication link from the brain to the external world
by converting brain thoughts into control commands to
control the external devices (robotic arm, wheelchair,
drones, neuroprosthesis, exoskeletons, keyboard mouse,
playing games, etc.). [4]
In this article, to measure brain activity noninvasive
EEG-based BCI device Emotiv Insight is used. Emotiv is
one of the BCI distributers to public users. The electrodes
are placed on the surface of the skull. To examine brain
activity, is used the record of brain activity responding to
visual and auditory stimuli. Emotiv Insight is mobile
wireless neuroheadset. This device has EEG sensors that
detect neurological activity. The data can be transferred to
a computer or smartphone via Bluetooth or USB. To
measure signal quality Emotiv Xavier ControlPanel
software is used.

2 Emotiv Insight
Emotiv Insight is designed for everyday use with
advanced electronics that produce clean and robust
signals, uses five channel EEG that senses brain activity.
Semi-dry polymer sensors are easy to use and clean.
Minimal setup time is only about two minutes. This

device works wirelessly. You may connect your computer
or mobile phone. This device lasts for up to nine hours.
To detect head movements nine-axis motion sensors are
available. [5]

3 Software Emotiv Xavier ControlPanel

Fig. 3 Software Emotiv Xavier ControlPanel – performance
metrics.

Free software Emotiv Xavier ControlPanel is used to
measure the signal. Raw EEG, mental commands,
performance metrics, and facial expressions detections
are available. In this article, there are affective
performance metrics including interest, engagement,
stress, relaxation, excitement, and focus.

There are five EEG sensors to sense brain activity and two
CMS/DRL references (left/right mastoid process
alternative). CMS (Common Mode Sense) is an active
electrode and DRL (Driven Right Leg) is a passive
electrode. [5]

The individual performance metrics are distinguished by
colors. We can see the signal status at the top of the
picture. The signals can be either high quality or not
available as you can see in the picture. We can also look
at the exact value of each metric.

The setup, pairing and signal quality can be checked in
Fig. 4. We can see that the Insight device is currently
connected and how long it took to setup the device.

4.1 Visual stimuli

Green sensors are located in the frontal, temporal and
parietal part of the head. The yellow sensors are the basic
electrode connected to the reference electrode.

Here is used the record of brain activity responding to
visual stimuli. For this measurement, a presentation of
various images was made. The presentation includes a
sequence of pictures of cute animals, funny dog,

hedgehog in a mug, starved kids, love, cute bunny, scary
house, sea, spider, and nature in spring. The total length
of the presentation is sixty seconds.
4.2 Auditory stimuli
In this part, is used the record of brain activity responding
to auditory stimuli. There were six different types of
sounds and music. The selection included relaxing music,
funny music, death metal, fairy tale, pop music, and
horror sounds. The total length of the presentation is one
hundred and twenty seconds.
4.3 Emotiv Insight
The first step is to attach the rear arm and sensors. The
second step is to charge the headset. The third step is to
turn on the headset. Here Bluetooth is used for the
connection. The last step is adjusting the headset with
good contact quality.

Fig. 7 Participant 1 – brain signals measured by Insight headset
responding to visual stimuli.

The level of interest was almost identical throughout the
measurement, except for an increase in the image of the
sea. The level of engagement for pictures of love, cute
bunny, and sea, has increased slightly and decreased in the
picture of hedgehog in a mug. The level of stress remained
steady for the whole time. The highest changes can be
seen in relaxation. Excitement level fell down in pictures
of funny dog and hedgehog in a mug. We can also see that
the focus was jumping significantly in every change. A
slight increase was observed in the picture of cute animals
and funny dog, and from the other side, decrement was in
the picture of the hedgehog in a mug and sea.

responding to visual stimuli.

Fig. 10 Participant 2 – brain signals measured by Insight
headset responding to auditory stimuli.

We can see on the graph that in the individual transitions
between images are big changes, but only for some
images. The interest is almost the same except for small
fluctuations during the measurement. We can see a huge
increase in engagement and relaxation in the picture of
cute animals, starved kids, cute bunny and nature in the
spring. We can see a jump in stress in images of starved
kids and a cute bunny. An increased excitement can be
seen in the picture of hedgehog in a mug and sea. The rise
of focus can be observed in the pictures of starved kids,
cute bunny and nature in the spring, while the decrease
can be seen in the first picture of a cute animal. We can
see that some signals are a bit inaccurate here and
significant reactions are only on some images.

We can see huge fluctuations in individual types of music.
The interest level remained steady except for small
fluctuations throughout the measurement. We can see that
the engagement, relaxation, and focus increased
individually according to the popular genre of the
participant. We can also see a huge increase in relaxation
while listening to relaxing music. The stress level
decreased most while listening to relaxation music and
increased most for horror sounds. The highest increase in
excitement was while listening to death metal.

5 Discussion
BCI is defined as a combination of hardware and software
that allows brain activities to control external devices or
even computers. The objective is to help severely disabled
people to live their life as regular people as much as
possible. However, this area can also serve healthy
people. The field of BCI is one of the important fields that
deals with brain activities. It is expected that BCI
applications will have a great effect on our daily life. In
the last decade, technological advances in BCIs permit
EEG acquisition by means of wireless, mobile, dry,
wearable, and low-cost EEG headsets, with new potential
daily-life applications. [6]
BCI can be used for many purposes in many areas,
especially in the field of robotic and rehabilitation. One of
the steps to optimize the BCI's capabilities, it should be
used together with other up-to-date technologies (called
hybrid BCI). [7] In another study was explored EEG
headset device, Emotiv Insight, for its applicability in
cognitive research. The conclusion was that the features
and usability of the EEG headset are according to the
research requirements. [8] Emotiv Insight is a very lowcost consumer-grade EEG device.

Fig. 9 Participant 1 – brain signals measured by Insight headset
responding to auditory stimuli.

On the graph, we can see huge fluctuations in individual
types of music. An increase in interest can be observed
while listening to death metal. The highest increase in
engagement and stress can be seen while listening to death
metal. The biggest fluctuations happened within the
relaxation. The large increase in excitement can be seen
while listening to death metal and fairy tale. High values
in focus we see while listening to death metal and pop
music.

6 Conclusion

References

This study discusses the quality of the signals and the
usability recorded using Emotiv Insight device. The
experimental evaluation of the devices was performed
with two participants. It was processed by four
measurements. Measurement of both first and second
participant on visual and audio stimuli was performed by
Insight headset. The first participant was a man with short
hair. Setup time was about two minutes. The second
participant was a woman with long and dense hair. The
device Insight was ready for use approximately after five
minutes. Insight headset can measure all emotional states,
despite the bad signal, so the measurement was not so
accurate. Emotiv Insight looks visually good and there is
quick setup. Nevertheless, on the other hand, the helmet
is quite uncomfortable and pushes. Due to it is not
recommended for medical or scientific purposes.
The values of individual participants to various stimuli
are very different. It may depend on what the participant
preferences. Eventually, this study showed that the Insight
is more suitable for entertainment.
