Abstract. Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a device that enables the connection between the human brain
and a computer, therefore, it allows us to observe the brain activity. The goal of this article is to prove that
brain-computer interface is a helpful and quite precise tool. This goal will be achieved by presenting various
examples from real-life situations. The results show that this device is indeed helpful, e.g. in a medical field,
however, it is not commonly used in hospitals.

1 Introduction
The EEG curve (Electroencephalogram) is a record of the
time change of electric potential caused by brain activity
(also known as EEG signal). This biological signal is
different for everyone (depending on age, gender,
vigilance and other factors). However, its character and
features are always the same which is the reason why the
signal is worth recording and processing. More
information about the EEG curve can be found here [3].
The signal can be captured by an invasive, partially
invasive or non-invasive method. With the invasive
method, the electrodes are implemented right to the grey
cerebral cortex during neurosurgery procedures. By doing
it this way, the signals are the highest quality of all the
other methods. However, a disadvantage is a permanent
brain damage. When doing the partially invasive method,
the electrodes are implemented inside of the skull, but also
outside of the brain. The quality of the signal is much
better than during the non-invasive method and the risk of
damaging the cerebral tissue is lower. During the noninvasive method, the electrical signal is captured from the
surface of the head. These individual methods are
described here [2].
The BCI Emotiv EPOC+ device (further referred to as
helmet) captures signals using the non-invasive method,
specifically by measuring voltage potentials from the
skull surface.
In our case, the EEG signal is measured and
processed directly by an app called Xavier. This app was
made by the same creators of the helmet. The free
standard version of Xavier allows us not only to capture
the metrics of performance (interest / affinity, excitement,
frustration, engagement, relaxation, focus, long term
excitement) and face expression, but also to control the
subject of the human mind. The paid version of Xavier
offers an analysis of raw, unprocessed EEG signals. This
could help with developing a new software.

This article deals with measuring the metrics of
performance during some specific activities using the free
version of the app Xavier. It also shows a possible use of
capturing these metrics in real life situations and other
professional fields [1-2].
The first part of the article mentions processing the
signal, but only theoretically as it is already integrated in
the Xavier app. Then there is the BCI chapter which
explains the concept of Brain Computer Interface – its
example is the Emotiv EPOC+ which we used. The
Emotiv EPOC+ is then described (including its
characteristics). After that, we move on to the
Experimental part with all the results. The last part of this
article is the Conclusion chapter that briefly goes through
all the results and possible solutions.

2 Signal Processing
The EEG signal that is captured by the non-invasive
method from the surface of the head, is formed by the
activity of neurons and its level of voltage is low (5-300
uV) and that’s why it’s necessary to process it. The
processing is integrated in the Xavier app. It happens in
several steps:
1. The preparation: Amplification of the signal and
removal of artefacts.
2. Digitalization: Continuous electrical biosignal is
converted into a discrete sequence of signal samples of
certain time intervals.
3. Processing the digital signal: This signal is then
processed using the Xavier app.

3 Brain Computer Interface

The helmet can detect:
•
Facial expressions: blink, wink (left/right), look
(left/right), furrow (frown), raise brow
(surprise), smile, clench teeth (grimace), laugh,
smirk left/right.
•
Performance metrics: interest / affinity,
excitement, frustration, engagement, relaxation,
focus, stress, long term excitement.
•
Mental Commands: push, pull, lift, drop, left,
right, rotate clockwise, rotate anti-clockwise,
rotate forwards, rotate backwards, rotate left,
rotate right, disappear.

The BCI device enables the connection between the
human brain and a computer. This device captures and
analyses biological EEG signals to use them for
controlling external devices and measuring performance
metrics, but also to make rehabilitations much easier etc.
We can see the main principle of how the BCI device
works in the picture (Fig. 1). At first, the brain activity is
measured using electrodes. Then, the measured signal
needs to get amplified. Although the BCI device is not
very known yet, it does have a future of helping people
who deal with poor health conditions. There are some
other devices based on a similar system, however, none of
them are as simple to use as the BCI. The other devices
usually require physical movement, whereas the BCI
devices works with neural activity only, making it much
easier for the users [2, 5].

In this paper, Emotional states are also described and
researched in experimental part.
4.1 The Connection
As mentioned previously, the scanning is based on the
non-invasive method. Before the helmet can be put on the
head of the person who is being examined, there is some
preparation that needs to be done.
Firstly, it’s necessary to lubricate the sensors that are
kept in a special case. After the lubrication, the sensors
can be connected to the helmet which is then put on the
head. Next, the helmet gets turned on and connected to a
computer. All the sensors don’t usually get connected at
once (as we can see in Fig. 3) and they need to be fixed
manually until the connection gets better.
In the picture (Fig. 4) we can see a red colour. It
indicates that a certain sensor isn’t touching the skin well
enough. Green, on the other hand, indicates that it is
perfectly in place and the measuring can begin.
Note: It’s been proven that for clearer results, it is
better to examine people with short hair rather than long
hair. This is due to the fact that long hair isolates the
contact and thus, the connection gets worse.

4 Emotiv EPOC+
Emotiv EPOC+ (Fig. 2) is a non-invasive BCI device
meant for scalable and contextual human brain research
and it provides access to professional grade brain data
with a quick and easy to use design.
Emotiv BCI device works using the International
10/20 system. This $799 device (the Research
Development Kit) comes as a set with a helmet that lets
us observe the brain activity including emotions and
intentions of the examined person. The set also includes
16 scalp sensors that work rather well, but it can be a little
difficult to connect them properly sometimes. These
difficulties are described in a next subchapter The
connection [4].

5.3 Example 3: Football Match

5 Experimental Part

The last example shows a man watching a football match.
It was cut to show only a six-minute part of the whole
record because this is the part where there was a high
probability of scoring a goal. In this picture (Fig. 7) we
can see the stress level rising to its double level. That was
due to the possibility of scoring a goal that, in the end, the
players didn’t manage to score.

5.1 Example 1: Math Exam
The first example describes how the performance metrics
were captured while the examined person was writing a
math exam. This exam consisted of 2 exercises – one of
them was more difficult, requiring a lot of thinking, while
the second one was quite easy. This process can be seen
in picture (Fig. 5). The pink colour shows interest, the
dark green means engagement, the light green stands for
stress, the blue is for relaxation, the red means long-term
excitement and finally, the purple shows focus.
These factors tell us that the student was busy
throughout the whole exam – this has to do with interest
(the engagement and interest curves have a similar
course). The focus and stress curves are a bit more
interesting – when the student was doing the first (more
difficult) exercise, it was more stressing for him than
during the second exercise. Another important part is the
look of the stress curve when he was told the exam was
over.

6 Conclusion
The BCI is not a new invention and as useful as it is, it
isn’t commonly used in hospitals. Judging by the
experiments, we can see that the results of this method are
quite accurate. Our university works with a hospital that
enjoyed trying this method and all the doctors saw it as a
useful thing. However, it does have a weakness – the
preparation for measuring takes a lot of time (the sensor
lubrication and connecting it to a software takes about 7
to 10 minutes). If the research ends up being even more
useful and helpful in the future, our university plans to buy
the full, paid version so that our research can be taken to
the next level. The paid version of this app offers
extracting the EEG signal and then process it using
statistics or informatics methods or neuronal networks.
This can help us build a useful software that helps doctors
diagnose brain disease or abnormal behaviour of the
brain.

5.2 Example 2: Rehabilitation
The second example is the use of the performance metrics
in hospitals during rehabilitations. Because of the BCI
device, the hospital worker is able to see if an exercise is
stressful for a patient (or if it’s not doing any physical
difference to them and therefore it isn’t helping the patient
at all). Due to this, the worker can make a new
rehabilitation plan for the patient. The picture (Fig. 6)
shows a patient during his rehabilitation in the University
Hospital in Ostrava.
