This work presents the use of swarm intelligence algorithms as a reliable method for the optimization of electroencephalogram
signals for the improvement of the performance of the brain interfaces based on stable states visual events. The preprocessing of
brain signals for the extraction of characteristics and the detection of events is of paramount importance for the improvement of
brain interfaces. The proposed ant colony optimization algorithm presents an improvement in obtaining the key features of the
signals and the detection of events based on visual stimuli. As a reference model, we used the Independent Component Analysis
method, which has been used in recent research for the removal of nonrelevant and detection of relevant data from the brain’s
electrical signals and also allows the collection of information in response to a stimulus and separates the signals that were generated
independently in certain zones of the brain.

1. Introduction
A brain computer interface (BCI) enables direct communication between a brain and a computer translating brain activity
into computer commands, thus providing no muscular interaction with the environment [1]. The development of brain
computer interface (BCI) systems is mainly based on the
information obtained by processing brain signals obtained by
electroencephalogram (EEG). Further to obtaining signals,
extraction and feature selection steps are vital for the development of applications; the BCI systems based on steadystate visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) have the advantage
over other BCI systems because they have a better signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) and faster transfer rate information (ITR)
[2]. Additionally it does not require intensive training and
requires fewer EEG channels for application development
and immunity from artifacts (flicker, movement joints, etc.)

[3, 4]. BCI-SSVEP systems are characterized by using stimuli
at different frequencies sensitive to the dynamic processes of
the occipital part of the cerebral cortex.
In recent years, algorithms based on swarm intelligence
(SI) have recently emerged as a family-based wild populations
of ant colony, bees, and swarm individuals algorithms which
are capable of producing low give robust computational cost
solutions to various complex and optimization problems [5,
6]. The ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm proposed
by Dorigo et al. (1996) is inspired by the foraging behavior
of some species of ants. Ants lay pheromones on the ground
in order to make a shorter path which eventually will be
followed by other members of the colony which increases the
probability of other ants following the same path resulting in
an optimal way from the nest to the food source. Biologists
have shown that many of the behaviors observed at the level
of colony of social insects can be explained by fairly simple

2
models in which only communication (called stigmergy) is
present. The idea behind the ant algorithms is to use some
form of artificial stigmergy to coordinate the societies of
artificial agents [7].
Deneubourg et al. (1990) proposed the original model Ant
Systems (AS). Several different aspects of the behavior of ant
colonies have inspired different types of ant’s algorithms, AS
Dorigo, et al. (1991), ELITIST AS Colorni et al. (1992), ANT-Q
Gambardella and Dorigo (1995), MAX-MIN AS Stützle and
Hoos (1996), RANK-BASED AS Bullnheimer et al. (1997),
HYPER-CUBE AS Blum et al. (2001) [8].
Recently, ACO has been used in biomedical data processing: Behnam and Pourghassem (2015), brain rhythms
detection with periodogram patters; Erguzel et al. (2014),
feature selection method for QEEG data classification; Huang
et al. (2012), feature selection method to classify hand motion
surface electromyography; Korürek and Nizam (2010), clustering analysis of ECG arrhythmias; and Burša and Lhotska
(2007), biomedical clustering process.
Resulting research ICA has been used in order to reduce
the calculation time by removing and constructing irrelevant
and relevant data from electrical brain signals obtained by
EEG to improve the performance of BCI systems [11]. In the
present work, AS model will be used as an improvement in the
EEG signals obtained by visual events and ICA will be used as
reference model to evaluate the performance of the proposed
method.

2. Background
2.1. Independent Components Analysis (ICA). ICA was introduced first by Comon (1994), with further developments by
Bell and Sejnowski (1995). Hyvärinen (2012) and Acharya and
Panda (2009) provide an overview of some recent developments in the ICA theory since 2000 on many fields as neural
computing, signal processing, and statistics. In the field of
biomedical sciences, Isomura and Toyoizumi (2016) used a
local learning rule for ICA to understand the processing
of neuronal information through natural images and their
applications in neuromorphic engineering. Gramfort et al.
(2014) presented a medical-software to help reduce EEG
signal artifacts. Mahajan and Morshed (2015); Akhtar et
al., Mammone at al., and Safieddine et al (2012) used ICA
removal artifact from multichannel EEG data. Oostenveld
et al. (2011) presented open source software for advanced
analysis of MEG, EEG, and invasive electrophysiological data
based on ICA. Kong et al. (2008) used ICA in microarray
gene expression data applications. Hung et al. (2005) used
it in recognition EEG motor imagery signals. James and
Hesse (2004) used it to separate measured multichannel EEG
signals. Vigário et al. (2000) and Tang et al. (2002) used
it to identify the artifacts and signals of interest obtained
by magnetoencephalograms (MEG). Jung et al. (2000 and
2002) used it on EEG signals. Liebermeister (2002) used it to
analyze gene expression patterns during the yeast cell cycle
and in the identification of human lymphocytes. Martoglio
et al. (2002) applied it to ovarian cancer data. Saidi et
al. (2004) showed that clustering in the ICA components
obtained clusters biologically more reasonably clustered than

Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society
clusters obtained by PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
It was found that ICA extracts more significant and
better interpretable components than PCA, and even an
unexpected experimental artifact was discovered. In addition, when applied to enzymatic activities, ICA was able
to provide components of greater discrimination and with
greater significance than PCA components [10].
Resulting research ICA has been used in order to reduce
the calculation time by removing and constructing irrelevant
and relevant data from electrical brain signals obtained by
EEG to improve the performance of BCI systems [11].
ICA is a method based on the statistical independence of
the components that form a signal. Statistical independence
is the main idea for the entire construction of the method,
since we want to find within our mixed signals those that are
statistically more independent than the others [9]. Statistical
independence is defined as follows: let 𝑥1 , 𝑥2 , . . . , 𝑥𝑛 be a set
of random variables with probability density function (PDF)
𝑓(𝑥1 , 𝑥2 , . . . , 𝑥𝑛 ); these variables are mutually independent if
𝑓 (𝑥1 , 𝑥2 , . . . , 𝑥𝑛 ) = 𝑓1 (𝑥1 ) 𝑓2 (𝑥2 ) . . . 𝑓𝑛 (𝑥𝑛 )

(1)

where 𝑓𝑖 is the marginal density function of 𝑥𝑖 (Figure 1).
Let 𝑥 = [𝑥1 , 𝑥2 , . . . , 𝑥𝑛 ] a vector of 𝑛 components;
we assume that this vector is produced as a linear combination (mixture) of 𝑛 independent signals denoted by
𝑠 = [𝑠1 , 𝑠2 , . . . , 𝑠𝑛 ]. We will assume for the implementation
of the algorithm that each of the signals 𝑠𝑖 is statistically
independent of the other signals; then
𝑥𝑖 = 𝑎𝑖1 𝑠1 + 𝑎𝑖2 𝑠2 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + 𝑎𝑛 𝑠𝑛 , 𝑖 = 1 . . . 𝑛

(2)

where the coefficients 𝑎𝑖𝑗 determine a matrix 𝐴 that is known
as a mixture matrix, the vector 𝑥 as the vector of mixtures, and
𝑠 the vector of independent components, so we can define the
system as
𝑥 = 𝐴𝑠

(3)

Figure 2 shows the relationship of (3).
Consider that the mixing components 𝑎𝑖𝑗 take values that
allow 𝐴 to be invertible (Figure 2). There exists a matrix 𝑊,
with coefficients 𝑤𝑖𝑗 such that it will allow us to separate the
signals 𝑠𝑖 (𝑡) as
𝑠1 (𝑡) = 𝑤11 𝑥1 (𝑡) + 𝑤12 𝑥2 (𝑡) + . . . 𝑤1𝑗 𝑥𝑗 (𝑡)
𝑠2 (𝑡) = 𝑤21 𝑥1 (𝑡) + 𝑤22 𝑥2 (𝑡) + . . . 𝑤2𝑗 𝑥𝑗 (𝑡)
..
.

(4)

𝑠𝑛 (𝑡) = 𝑤𝑛1 𝑥1 (𝑡) + 𝑤𝑛2 𝑥2 (𝑡) + . . . 𝑤𝑛𝑗 𝑥𝑛 (𝑡)
𝑗 = 1..𝑛

which we can define as
𝑦 = 𝑊𝑥

(5)

where 𝑦 ≅ 𝑠.
ICA method consists of applying an algorithm that allows
us to find the matrix 𝑊 in such a way as to be a good
approximation of the vector 𝑠 [9, 12].

2.2. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The ant colony optimization algorithms are part of swarm intelligence (SI),
which is the field of research that studies algorithms inspired
by the social behavior of the insects and other animals.
Algorithms based on swarms have recently emerged as a
family of algorithms based on nature populations that are able
to produce, at low cost and fast robust solutions to various
complex problems and optimization [5, 13, 14], as well as some
applications of grouping of data [15–18].
Ant colonies and, in general, groups of social insects,
despite the simplicity of their individuals, have a highly structured social organization. Because of these organizations, ant
colonies can perform complex tasks that in some cases far
outweigh the individual capacities of a single ant. The fields
of “ant algorithms” are models of studies derived from the
observation of the behavior of real ants and these models
are used as a source of inspiration for the design of new
algorithms for optimization solution and distributed control
problems [7].

The main idea is that the principles of self-organization
that allow the highly coordinated behavior of real ants can
be exploited to coordinate populations of artificial agents
that collaborate to solve computational problems. Several
different aspects of the behavior of ant colonies have inspired
different types of ant algorithms: search for food, division of labor, classification of breeding, and cooperative
transport. In all these examples, the ants coordinate their
activities through stigmergy, a form of indirect communication by a slight modification of the environment. In
the search for food, the ant deposits a chemical (called
pheromone) in the soil, which increases the likelihood
that other ants will follow the same path. Biologists have
shown that many of the behaviors observed at the social
insect colony level can be explained through simple models in which only stigmergy communication is present.
The idea behind ant algorithms is to use some form of
artificial stigmergy to coordinate artificial agent societies
[7].

Recently, SI algorithms have been used in biomedical
data processing of biomedical data such as EEG and electrocardiogram (ECG) [19–22]. For instance, Cheng et al.
(2016) used ACO for reconstructing ECG signals; Salem et
al. (2014) used ant colony (AC) for the detection of epileptic
seizures on EEG signals. Erguzel et al. (2014) used ACO as
a method of classifying data in quantitative EEG signals.
Korürek and Nizam (2010) used ACO for clustering MIT-BIH
arrhythmias; Burša and Lhotska (2006) used AC and ACO as
ECG interpretation.
The first proposed algorithm within the ACO metaheuristic was the Ant System (AS) to solve the Travel Agent
Problem (TSP) problem in which we search for the optimal
route between a set of cities that the traveler must visit only
once and return to the starting point.
2.3. Ant System (AS). The first proposed algorithm within
the ACO metaheuristic was the Ant System (AS) to solve the
Travel Agent Problem (TSP) problem in which we search for
the optimal route between a set of cities that the traveler must
visit only once and return to the starting point.
Formally the TSP can be represented by a weighted
complete graph 𝐺 = (𝑁, 𝐴), where 𝑁 is a set of nodes
representing cities and 𝐴 the set of arcs between cities. Each
arc (𝑖, 𝑗) ∈ 𝐴 is assigned a weight (length) 𝑑𝑖𝑗 which is the
distance between city 𝑖 and city 𝑗, with 𝑖, 𝑗 ∈ 𝑁. The objective
in the TSP is to find a Hamiltonian circuit of minimum
length of the graph [7]. An optimal solution for the TSP is
a permutation 𝜋 of the indexes of nodes {1, 2, ...𝑛} such that
𝑓(𝜋) is minimal, where 𝑓(𝜋) is defined by
𝑛−1

𝑓 (𝜋) = ∑ 𝑑𝜋(𝑖)𝜋(𝑖+1) + 𝑑𝜋(𝑛)𝜋(𝑛)

(6)

𝑖=1

In the AS algorithm, 𝑚 ants are placed in different random
cities that simultaneously construct a path for the TSP. Each
ant constructs a feasible solution to the problem by applying
an iterative probabilistic transition rule called proportional
random rule to decide which city to visit next. The probability
𝑝 with which the ant 𝑘 that is currently in the city 𝑖 chooses
to go to the city 𝑗 is

on their path. The pheromone evaporation is calculated
according to
𝜏𝑖𝑗 ←󳨀 (1 − 𝜌) 𝜏𝑖𝑗 , ∀ (𝑖, 𝑗) ∈ 𝐿

where 𝐿 = 𝐴 and 0 < 𝜌 ≤ 1 is the evaporation rate
of the pheromone. The parameter 𝜌 is used to avoid the
unlimited accumulation of pheromones in the trail and allows
the algorithm to “forget” the bad decisions made previously.
If associated value of pheromones decreases, the ants do
not choose an arc exponentially based on the number of
iterations. After evaporation, all the ants deposit pheromones
in the bows they have crossed on their tour:
𝑚

𝜏𝑖𝑗 = (1 − 𝜌) 𝜏𝑖𝑗 + ∑ Δ𝜏𝑖𝑗𝑘 , ∀ (𝑖, 𝑗) ∈ 𝐿

otherwise

where 𝜂𝑖𝑗 = 1/𝑑𝑖𝑗 , 𝛼 and 𝛽, determine the relative influence
of the pheromone and the heuristic information, respectively,
𝑁𝑖𝑘 is the set of neighboring cities the ant k, being in city 𝑖, has
not visited, and the probability of choosing a city outside 𝑁𝑖𝑘
is 0.
Based on (7) the probability of choosing a particular arc
(𝑖, 𝑗) increases with the value of the pheromone 𝜏𝑖𝑗 associated
with the trail. Once all the ants have built a complete tour, the
pheromone trail is updated; this is done first by reducing the
value of the pheromone in all arcs by a constant factor, and
then add pheromone in the arcs that the ants have crossed

(9)

(𝑖, 𝑗) by the ant 𝑘. Δ𝜏𝑖𝑗𝑘 is calculated as

3.2. Experimental Protocol. Twenty-nine healthy volunteers,
17 men and 12 women, aged 20-29 and 48-50, participated in
the experiment. 17 of them with normal vision and 12 corrected vision. The EEG signals were obtained by a portable,
high-resolution multibrand equipment, Emotiv Epoc+ EEG
model. The equipment has 16 electrodes, 14 data channels
and 2 reference channels, which were placed in the standard
positions of the international 10-20 system (Figure 4). The
transfer rate is 128 bps of a frequency response from 0.16 to
43 Hz with 14 to 16 bit resolution and dynamic range of +/4.17mV per channel.
During the experimental trials, the study subjects were
seated in a comfortable chair to 70 cm apart from a standard
15-inch LCD monitor (with a screen resolution of 1024 x 768
and a refresh rate of 60 Hz).
3.3. Experiment. The experiment is based on tests performed
visual discrimination by Makeig et al. (1999) for the study
of BCI systems based SSVEP. The objective of the tests is
to obtain data related stimuli in the brain signals during
an exercise of simple attention; search to find the difference
between attention-related and unrelated stimuli. The test
subjects must discriminate between different types of stimuli
that are presented at high speed.
Study subjects set their gaze on a cross, which is on
top of one five boxes at a time that are constantly displayed

(Figure 5). Each test block last for 76 s with approximately 5 s
initial preparation. Stimuli presented as a series of red circles
are briefly presented in any of the five boxes in a random
order. The boxes are blue and one is green. The location of
the latter is random during test periods. The stimuli presented
within the green box are attended stimuli (events); stimuli
within the blue boxes are known as unattended stimuli.
Before starting the test, the subject is asked to concentrate
whenever a red circle appears in the green box [26]. The
outlines of the pictures are of 1.6 cm, displayed on a black
background horizontal viewing angles 0∘ ± 2.7∘ to ± 5.5∘ ,
and fixed. Each stimulus is displayed for 117 ms to one of
five empty spaces inside the boxes with a pseudo-random
sequence. Stimuli are presented to the subject in a random
position of 250 ms, 500 ms, 750 ms, and 1 s, intervals between
stimuli (ISI) between 250 and 1000 ms (Figure 6). At the
beginning of the test, a black screen is presented for 5 s
for the stabilization of the signals; the test begins with the
configuration shown in Figure 7(a). In each test, a total of
100 stimuli are presented in total: 20 attended (events) 80
unattended (Figures 7(b) and 7(c), respectively), the last 200
ms stimulus remains on the screen before disappearing [27].
3.4. Proposed Model. Figure 8 shows the classical model
ICA, where two signals, in this case O1 and O2, are mixed

are obtained, and then a reconstruction of the signal is
made based only on the found independent components
(Figure 8(b)).
Figure 9 shows block diagram of proposed model based
on the implementation of the ant colony optimization algorithm, described in Section 2.3 to the signals derived from
EEG, based on an SSVEP-based BCI system.
After acquisition, signals from EEG, the electrodes O1
and O2, which are directly related to the visual processing
of the brain signals, are selected. These signals are postprocessed using the proposed ACO algorithm to obtain an
optimized signal (ACO-O1O2), Figure 9(a). Subsequently
a mixture of the original signals (O1/O2) is performed
separately, with the optimized signal ACO-O1O2, its mean

mixture O1 with ACO-O1O2, and mixture O2 with ACOO1O2. The ICA model, described in Section 2.1, is applied
to the mixed signals to obtain its independent components.
Finally, the signal is reconstructed based on the independent components obtained, as shown on Figure 9(b).
To establish the performance of the proposed model, a
comparison of the original reconstructed signals (O1/O2)
with the reconstructed signals using the ACO model is
performed. Figure 10 showed flowchart proposed model.

model of the present work is shown in Figure 11, as well as the
algorithm implemented in Figure 12.
Illustratively, consider a pair of segments of the O1 and O2
signals (Figure 13) with 20 data points each, which represent
the cities for a total of 40 cities. Consider the set of cities as
{𝐶0 , 𝐶1 , . . . , 𝐶𝑁−1 } and 𝑑𝑖𝑗 the distance (the cost of the edge)
between the cities (𝐶𝑖 , 𝐶𝑗 ). Explicitly, cities can be seen as
points of a 2-dimensional space, so we can represent them
as 𝐶𝑖 = (𝑥𝑖 , 𝑦𝑖 ) and 𝐶𝑗 = (𝑥𝑗 , 𝑦𝑗 ). The distance between

cities is calculated by means of the Euclidean distance defined
as

𝑑𝑖𝑗 = √ (𝑥𝑖 − 𝑥𝑗 ) + (𝑦𝑖 − 𝑦𝑗 )

(11)

We define the matrix of nodes formed by the order of the
points in the sequence of the signal and the values of the
points of each signal (Figure 14). To the graph 𝐺, 𝑁 = 40,
𝐴 is a matrix of dimension 𝑁 × 2 × 2 defined by 𝐴 = 𝑁 ×
{𝑂1 − 𝑂1, 𝑂1 − 𝑂2} × {𝑂2 − 𝑂1, 𝑂2 − 𝑂2} (Figure 15), which

Figure 17 shows the graph 𝐺 obtained.
We define the probability matrix (probs) as the matrix
that represents the probabilities of traversing an arch between

nodes (Figure 18(a)). The pheromone matrix is the matrix that
represents the amount of pheromone deposited by each ant as
it passes through a city (Figure 18(b)). Figure 18(c) shows the
representation of the route matrix (tours) that indicates the
nodes visited by each ant based on the probability matrix.

Figure 19: Optimization process of 2 ants during 5 iterations.

Figure 19 represents the simulation of the path of two ants
during 5 iterations and Figure 20 represents the flowchart
algorithm.

4. Results and Discussion
The computational simulation of the proposed model was
developed in MATLAB V9.1.0441655 (R2016b), as well as

EEGLAB V13.6.b. Figure 21(a) shows a segment of 5 s of the
original signals O1 and O2 obtained from EEG. The ACO
parameters used to experiment were pheromone generation
constant 𝑄 = 1, influence parameter 𝛼 = 0.5, attractive
parameter 𝛽 = 2, pheromone evaporation parameter 𝜌 =
0.25, amount of ants 20, and number of iterations for the tours
5. The optimization signal obtained with the ACO algorithm
is showed in Figure 21(b). Test durations were approximately
65-72 s.

Figure 21: (a) EEG signals of the electrodes O1 and O2 and (b) representation of the signal optimized by means of the ACO algorithm based
on the signals of the electrodes O1 and O2.

The representation of the mixture of the original signals
as well as the histogram of each source signal, which approximates the PDF representation of the signals, is shown in
Figures 22 and 23, respectively; Figure 24 showed the independent components (IC1, IC2) obtained from ICA process.
Based on ICA model, Figure 25 shows the original
signals O1, O2 and the result of mixing them to obtain the
reconstructed signal. We can observe that, for the present

example, the reconstruction of the electrode O1 is very similar
to the original; in the case of O2, we can appreciate the loss of
some elements of the original signal.
The comparison of the original signals with the reconstructed signals generated by mixing the signals O1 and O2
with the optimized signal ACO is shown in Figures 26 and 27,
respectively. We can observe in both cases less loss of elements
in the reconstructed signals.

O1 and ACO.

Figure 27: Comparison of the original signal and the reconstructed signal (extracted) implementing in the ACO model the mixture of signals
O2 and ACO.

After ICA process, we can observe in the histograms
of Figure 28 that in IC2 the dispersion is much smaller in
the case of the mixtures with ACO (Figures 28(b), 28(d),
and 28(f)), and in the case of IC1, the dispersion is similar
(Figures 28(a), 28(c), and 28(e)), where we can interpret that
the mixture of ACO concentrates more elements of the signal.
Figure 29 shows the power spectrum density (PSD)
for the ICA components at each electrode for the study
mixtures, more specifically for the corresponding frequency
to the stimuli performed (0.895 Hz). The PSD in the IC1
component behaves similarly for O1 in all mixtures (Figures
29(a), 29(b), and 29(c)); however, for O2 the power is
higher for mixtures with ACO (Figures 29(b) and 29(c)). The
higher the power, the greater the probability of finding the
stimulus frequency. In Figure 30 we observed the stimulus
frequency (0.895 Hz), and its harmonics (1.79, 2.685, 3.58,...)
are present in all the signals generated by the study, which
implies that the components retain one of the main features
of the signal. The spectrograms in Figure 31 show that the
stimulus frequency manifests in all signals, both original and
reconstructed.
Table 1 shows the results obtained from the implementation of the ICA model. The ORIGINAL column represents
the mixture of the original signals and the EXTRACT column
the signals reconstructed from independent components. The

values shown represent the correlation between the signals (1
would represent that a signal is identical to another).
Comparing the original O1-O2 signals mixed with the
ACO signal, we have 82.76% better correlation O1-ACO
versus O1-O2, 10.34% with equal correlation, and only 6.9%
better correlation between O1-O2 (Figure 32(a)). We have
86.2% better correlation between O2-ACO versus O1-O2 and
a 13.8% better correlation between O1-O2 (Figure 32(b)).
In the case of reconstructed signals, we have an 82.76%
better correlation in O1-ACO versus O1-O2, 6.9% with
equal scores, and a 10.34% better correlation in O1-O2
(Figure 32(c)). We obtain an 86.2% better correlation of
O2-ACO versus O1O2 and only a 13.8% better correlation
between O1-O2 versus O2-ACO (Figure 32(d)).
The results of the correlation of the signals show that the
signals optimized with ACO, either in the original signals
or in the reconstructed signals, present better characteristics
in the selection of components than in the original signals
without optimizing.
In Figure 33, we can see that 24 of 29 users in O1 and 24
of 29 users in O2 obtained a better signal reconstructed using
the optimization signal ACO (1 mean identical signals). Three
users with the same result are shown in O1 and 2 users in O2,
and only 2 in O1 and 3 in O2 where the use of the O1 and O2
signals show an improvement in the reconstruction.

5. Conclusions
The methods inspired by swarm intelligence can be applied in
many stages of the process of biomedical data processing; in
this work, we have presented techniques inspired by the ants
with respect to the processing of EEG signal data. We have

presented and evaluated the AS method to obtain optimized
signals that can be used to extract its characteristics and
improve the characteristics of the original signals.
The results obtained show a good optimization capacity
when treating the set of EEG signals as a TSP problem
solved with ACO; applying our proposal to real biomedical
