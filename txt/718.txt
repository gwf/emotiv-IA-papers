consciousness. Electroencephalogram (EEG) can record and interpret electrical actvity from the brain. It is
noninvasive technique, which measure signals from the scalp. In our paper, we decide to choose EEG device from the
company Emotiv system. They provide EEG helmet with 14 channels called Emotiv EPOC+. It is a scalable system
applied in context research of the human brain. This technology device can record, identify and interpret brain activity.
The most critical criteria of evaluation EEG is frequency. Frequency is a criterion for assessing abnormalities in
clinical EEG and for understanding functional behaviors in cognitive research. There are five different types of brain
waves: gamma, beta, alpha, theta and delta. Each brain wave has a different frequency, amplitude, and meaning. [13]
This paper describes and analyses the brainwaves while driving a car. The paper aims to describe which brainwave
is active in some actions and compare this data for both genders. The first part of the article is devoted to methods of
data measurement and analysis in the application. Another necessary part is the result section. It describes the course
of measurement and the data obtained, which are explained and described. In the part of the discussion and conclusion,
a summary of the research and other possible solutions are described.

2. Methods
We used the Emotiv Epoc+ headset, which works with EEG technology. This device was developed by Emotiv
system and includes 16 sensors for recording brain activity. The device records the signal at 128 Hz with a sufficient
resolution of 14 bits per channel and a frequency response in the range of 0.16 to 43 Hz. The helmet also provides 2.4
GHz wireless data transfer with battery. Therefore, the helmet can capture the brain activity for 8 hours.

According to this technology, we have to work with the application developed by the same company. The
application Emotiv Brain Activity Map v3.3.3 was the best option for displaying brain waves in real-time. This
application measures and displays data of the brain activity. There are visibly four brain waves with different
frequencies which can be measured and shown. These waves are Alpha, Beta, Theta and Delta. Each of the brain
waves has a different frequency, amplitude and meaning. Human behaviors in each brainwave were analysed and
described [5,6]. See Table 1.

Selected persons for this measurement were male and female. The measurement took place in a vehicle. The tested
person put on the Emotiv Epoc+ helmet and was seated into the automobile. The primary task for the testing person
was only to drive. The person was navigated because the route did not discuss. Both persons drove the same route due
to obtaining accurate results. Data were collected and consequently analysed in the application.

3. Results
This chapter aims to present the results of measuring brain activity during a driving a car. The results are taken in
the application Emotiv Brain Activity Map. The results are not in data form, but as a visualization of brain activity.
The spectrum of the colour, from blue to red, signalizes the strength of the signal from the weakest to the strongest.

3.1. Testing person – male
Data were measured in the car under normal conditions. The person was driving the car in normal traffic
conditions. There were four different situations during the journey, which were further analysed. These actions are
turning left and right, stop at the traffic lights, and the last was parking. Each of these actions was shown in Table 2.

Table 1 shows four different activities and four brain waves, which can occur in these actions. The active brain
wave which was recorded in the given situation was written into the table by the letter A. If the wave is not active, X

is written into the table. The first and second row describes turning. Turning left caused increasing only theta brain
wave. However, turning right activates not only theta wave but also beta and alpha wave — different types of
command cause these differentials. The instruction to turn left was given clearly. The explanation of theta waves
could be in visualization and problem-solving. However, the instruction to turn right was given at the last moment,
and the driver had to decide quickly. This situation caused activation of three brainwaves. Dr. Jeffrey D. Thompson
mentioned that Beta/Alpha bridge state is the mental place the brain goes to when it becomes hyper-efficient in dealing
with the task at hand because it can focus on the details as well as the overall scope of the problem or task at the same
time. The explanation of these three waves is a significant focus on executing at the last minute. [6]
During a stop at the traffic lights increased the activity of three brain waves — alpha, beta, and theta. Alpha
represents the thinking and concentrates on details. It could mean the focusing on “the green” colour at the traffic
light. Theta, in this example, could involve intuition – because the man has already known that when he sees a red
colour, he must stop. The beta wave may represent the actively engaged mind. It also indicated that beta is occurring
on the left hemisphere, which means logic and analytical thinking.
The last row describes which brain wave is active during a parking a car. When the man started parking, the only
visible brain wave was theta. It indicated that theta is associated with intense creativity, visualization ability,
imagination and problem-solving. All of these features are essential for parking.

The conditions for testing was the same as in the previous measurement. The testing person was tested on the four
different actions. These actions are turning left and right, stop at the traffic lights, and the last one was parking. Each
of these actions was analysed and can be seen in Table 3.

The first and second rows in Table 3 inform about turning. In both situations, one brain wave is active - theta. The
explanation of increase activity this wave could be interpreted as thinking and visualization of command, which was
given.
The third row shows brainwaves, which were occurring while the women stopped at traffic lights. The brainwave,
which is involved in this action is beta. Beta is responsible for emotions and engaged mind. The presence of this wave
can indicate the involvement of the mind when detecting the colour of the traffic light. It can also mean a negative
emotion that is associated with stopping at traffic lights. The last row displays the brain waves during parking. The
active brain waves are beta and theta. Engaged mind, problem-solving and visualization ability are reasons, which can
reveal these brain waves.

4. Discussion
The results of our research aimed to figure out which brainwave occur in different actions during car driving. The
most frequent brainwave, which was indicated, was a theta wave in the frontal hemisphere. It proved that during
driving engages creativity and reasoning. It is hard to compare gender results, because the condition for testing, was
not the same: the first experiment was conducted in the evening, but the measuring of women was conducted in the
morning. Also, the weather conditions were different. There are a couple of gender differences in measuring of brain
activity. The power of signals was higher in the male results and also there some differences in active brainwave. But,
this paper is not primary focused on gender difference. The main purpose was to find out what brain waves are active
in a particular activity. Differences in these results may be due to non-physiological factors. However, the evaluating
data match with the expected results. Compare to some studies we can say, that alpha activity in the female is higher
than male activity. Some studies inform that brain waves can be affected by addictive substances. We should
recognize the power of emotions, tiredness or using drugs or caffeine. All of these substances increase the beta brain
wave. In our experiment, we did not register these phenomena. [6] [8]
This study can serve as a first introduction to EEG measurements while driving an automobile. More in-depth
exploration could be useful in recognizing fatigue or reasoning by the car driver. For this analysis should be developed
own interface for evaluating data. Another possibility for future work should be data processing in computing
environments such as Matlab or Wolfram Mathematica.
Our research is not so objective because there was measured a small group of subjects. The better results of measure
should be displayed in simulated driving. The driver's fatigue is poorly measured in normal traffic due to safety.

5. Conclusion
This paper deal with the analysis of EEG during the driving an automobile. Electroencephalography is the
measurement of the electrical activity of the brain by recording from electrodes located on the scalp. In our experiment,
two people were measured and subsequently analysed. This experiment was done with using Emotiv devices,
especially Emotiv Epoc+. The results of the analysis were processed in the application Emotiv Brain Activity Map.
