Drowsiness Detection and Management
Jibo He*
Department of Psychology, Wichita State University, USA

Drowsiness disrupts work performance and increases the risks of
accidents substantially, especially for performance-critical tasks, such
as driving and piloting. Each year, 100,000 police-reported crashes
are directly caused by driver drowsiness, which results in about 1,550
deaths, 71,000 injuries, and $12.5 billion financial losses, according to
an estimation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
[1]. The National Sleep Foundation estimated in 2002 that 51% of
adult drivers had driven a vehicle while drowsy and 17% had fallen
asleep behind the wheel. Pilot drowsiness is an important factor in
pilot performance and aviation accidents [2]. Pilot drowsiness can
reduce alertness and attention and cause longer response times [3].
Drowsiness is also concerning because people’s own judgment of their
susceptibility to drowsiness is poor [4].
To mitigate the risks of drowsiness on driving and piloting,
drowsiness detection technologies and drowsiness management
programs are demanded. This article introduces existing and emerging
technologies for drowsiness detection and drowsiness management
strategies and calls for more research into the effects of drowsiness on
task performance.

and convenient to collect EEG brain waves. Future research should
consider predictability, reliability, affordability, and intrusiveness to
detect drowsiness using various sensors or their combinations.
Besides the above-mentioned technologies for drowsiness
detection, some management strategies can also be used to combat
drowsiness [15]. For example, drivers and pilots should take a break
or should take turns after working for a long period of time. However,
temporary breaks from driving can only reduce time-on-task fatigue
but not sleepiness [16]. Drivers and pilots can take caffeine, specifically
slow-release caffeine, if they have to continue their work and there
is no opportunity to take a break [17]. Long-time drivers and pilots
should be informed about their tendency toward drowsiness and
provided drowsiness management techniques.Future research should
evaluate the effectiveness of different counter measurements to reduce
drowsiness and improve task performance.

Drowsy drivers and pilots manifest their fatigue states in various
ways, such as heart rate, respiration rate, blood pressure, head and eye
movement and task performance. For a drowsy driver or pilot, the delta
and theta components of electroencephalography increase significantly
[5]; heart rate decreases [6]; respiratory rate decreases; blood pressure
increases [7,8]; blood oxygen concentration is lower (under 18%) [9];
blink rate and eye closure exceeding 1 second increase [4,5,10]; head
nods more often [11]. Moreover, drowsy drivers and pilots perform
poorly and make more errors [3,11].

Drowsiness can be detected using a variety of sensors,
including
electroencephalograph
(EEG),
electrocardiogram
(ECG), polyphysiograph, accelerator sensors, and oculographical
measurements. The relative strengths of the EEG components, such as
(θ+α)/β, (α+β)/θ, α/ β, (θ+ α)/ (α+β) and θ/ β, are commonly used to
predict drowsiness [12]. Three-axis accelerators can be used to detect
head movements, such as head nods. Infrared cameras or smartphone
cameras can be used to monitor oculographical measurements, such as
eye blinks and PERCLOS (Percentage of Eye Closure).

Different sensors have their own advantages and disadvantages.
EEG is one of the most predictive and reliable techniques for drowsiness
detection [13,14]. However, EEG sensors are often expensive, timeconsuming to setup, and intrusive. Camera-based drowsiness detection
often does not require users to wear a device, therefore less intrusive.
However, it is hard to develop computer vision algorithms robust
enough to detect faces and eyes of different skin colors, and under
various weather and lighting conditions. Accelerator sensor is cheap
but can only detect head movements.
New advancements in mobile technologies and sensors make
drowsiness detection more feasible and affordable in real-world tasks.
For example, Dr. He and his coworkers used Android and iPhone
smartphones to detect visual indicators of driver fatigue, such as head
nods, head rotation, and eye blinks. The increasing popularity of dry
EEG sensors, such as Emotiv and Neurosky, makes it more affordable
