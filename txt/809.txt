Living well in the Neuropolis

Des Fitzgerald, Nikolas Rose and Ilina Singh

Abstract: This paper is about the relationship between cities and brains: it charts the
back-and-forth between the hectic, stressful lives of urban citizens, and a psychological
and neurobiological literature that claims to make such stress both visible and knowable. But beyond such genealogical labour, the paper also asks: what can a sociology
concerned with the effects of ‘biosocial’ agencies take from a scientiﬁc literature on the
urban brain? What might sociology even contribute to that literature, in its turn? To
investigate these possibilities, the paper centres on the emergence and description of
what it calls ‘the Neuropolis’ – a term it deploys to hold together both an intellectual
and scientiﬁc ﬁgure and a real, physical enclosure. The Neuropolis is an image of the
city embedded in neuropsychological concepts and histories, but it also describes an
embodied set of (sometimes pathological) relations and effects that take places between
cities and the people who live in them. At the heart of the paper is an argument that
ﬁnding a way to thread these phenomena together might open up new paths for thinking about ‘good’ life in the contemporary city. Pushing at this claim, the paper argues
that mapping the relations, histories, spaces, and people held together by this term is a
vital task for the future of urban sociology.

Introduction
In October 2012, Alison Abbott, one of Nature’s regular editorial writers, published a News Feature in the journal, under the title ‘Stress in the City: Urban
Decay’ (Abbott 2012). The article pointed out that while many of us intuit a
connection between cities, stress and mental health, recent research has started
to concretize this link: ‘scientists are [now] tackling the question head on, using functional brain imaging and digital monitoring to see how people living in
cities and rural areas differ in the way that their brains process stressful situations’ (2012: 163). Abbott was referring particularly to work from the group of
Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg, director of the Central Institute for Mental Health
in Mannheim: a paper from this group, also published in Nature, showed how
people who had been brought up in cities, or who lived in cities, had distinctive neurological responses to a stressful stimulus (Lederbogen et al., 2011). The

genesis of this research was biographical: when studying in New York, MeyerLindenberg ‘had been struck by the number of homeless mentally ill people on
the streets’ and began to wonder ‘if city living was somehow making the brain
more susceptible to mental-health conditions’ (Abbott, 2012: 164).
This is not an unreasonable question. And yet those who work on the history
of mental health in the metropolis might be forgiven some surprise. Because, of
course, these issues have been extensively studied since the start of the twentieth
century. Within that period, a loosely affiliated agglomeration of sociologists,
scientists, psychiatrists and policy-makers, noting the preponderance of mental
health problems in urban spaces, tried to understand how it is, exactly, that cities
sometimes unravel people (Schroeder, 1942). Indeed, this was a foundational
concern for sociology, becoming a deﬁning focus of its ﬁrst major North
American school (Park and Burgess, 1967 [1925]). Relations between mental
disorder and metropolitan living were also a regular concern of epidemiologists
and social psychiatrists from the 1930s to the 1970s (Malzberg, 1930; Milgram,
1970). And for many, the key intermediary experience linking urban life with
its mental consequences was – as it is for neuroscientists today – stress. So why
now all this excitement about ‘the brain’? What does neurobiology bring to our
understanding of the good and bad consequences of city living? Why do we need
a neuroscience of the urban, rather than a psychology, or a social psychology,
to understand the impact that living in such environments actually has on the
mental lives of urban citizens?
In this paper, we are trying to get some purchase on the intellectual landscape
in which such questions are rooted – and this is the emergence of what is today
(sometimes) called the ‘biosocial’.1 We will argue that there are reasons to be
sceptical about a turn from the social and the mental to the neural, and especially about the mapping of speciﬁc forms of social and mental life onto their
biological antecedents. But we will also suggest that a renewed focus on the ‘urban brain’ just might – perhaps in spite of itself – expand our understanding of
the potential of these new ‘biosocial’ agencies. It might help us to think more
carefully about both the scientiﬁc and political implications of their emergence,
not least in terms of the possibilities and the responsibilities they present to the
sociological sciences.
At the heart of the paper is an attempt to simultaneously track the emergence
of two phenomena. The ﬁrst is a broadly sketched intellectual space, developing
over the last century or so, in which ‘the city’ has been narrated and theorized
as a torrent of stress-inducing stimulation (visual, auditory, affective) – with the
urban dweller, in her turn, understood as the fretful recipient of its hectic, and
often pathological, energy. The second is a physical space of brick and brain, a
historical relation, or set of relations, in which nonetheless real, present, actual
urban subjects do, indeed, under certain conditions, exhibit measureable differences in brain function – differences which might well be traced to that subject’s
inhabitation of, or experience in, the tumultuous urban scene.
What would happen if we could hold these two ﬁgures together? What if we
could thread a sociocultural attention to the scientiﬁc and intellectual emergence

of ‘the stressful city’ through a more organic interest in whether the inhabitants
of that city are, nonetheless, living well? What if we began to think, empirically,
about some of the ways in which a set of experiences, within a range of cities,
made visible through a wide array of scientiﬁc practices, can marble the social
and historical ﬁxations through which those experiences have come to matter?
(Barad, 2003). In what follows, we will use the term Neuropolis to help us think
about these bio-political intersections: the Neuropolis is the city understood as a
matrix of transactions between urban life and the always-developing, malleable
brains of urban citizens. Its object is a real conurbation, and not an ideological
ﬁction: it describes an organization of physical spaces and social lives, of
interpersonal exchanges and chance encounters, of economic relations and
commercial transactions – and all of these simultaneously lived and transacted
through the embodied lives of Neuropolitan citizens.2 But the Neuropolis is a
historical and political space too: it encloses and emphasizes the continued
salience of an urban existence that has been tracked by social historians and
ethnographers, even as it refuses to separate this existence from the dynamic and
mutable capacities of the urban brain. At the heart of this determinedly singular
term is a proposal – maybe a hope – that the collaborations initiated by such a
perspective could open up a new neurological politics of urban life.
Suturing the social to the biological in the Neuropolis has another purpose
too. It is tempting to stress the novelty of new possibilities in the life sciences
– in epigenetics, neuroplasticity, the microbiome – which disrupt long-standing
epistemological and ontological divisions between the organism (bounded; uniﬁed) and the environment (exterior; distinct). We are sympathetic to the desire
for intensifying these potentials. But we are less convinced by the temporalities
that are sometimes mobilized on their behalf: if we, too, have been tempted to
talk about a promise-ﬁlled, biosocial future displacing the doleful reductionism
of the past – still, the more work that we do on the history of urban psychiatry,
the more we are struck by the deep tangles of social and biological thought that
have persisted through the century just passed. What we can today understand
as urban neuroscience has long, complex, ambiguous relationships to psychiatry
and psychology, to social epidemiology and human ecology, as well as to the social sciences more generally. We use the image of the Neuropolis – its inheritances
as well as its novelties – to keep this temporality alive. We want to see if this image, and the intellectual and empirical trajectories that it holds together, can help
us to think a new, democratic politics, for living well in the neurological city.

The neurotic city
Because, of course, there is nothing new in the idea that cities jar the nerves.
In 1903, among a series of lectures delivered in Dresden to mark the ﬁrst
German Municipal Exhibition, Georg Simmel argued that understanding
modernity meant understanding a profound acceleration of the individual’s
psychological and organic struggle vis-à-vis the social and historical forces that
surrounded her (Frisby, 2002). It was the city, above all, that signiﬁed this shift:

Des Fitzgerald, Nikolas Rose and Ilina Singh

modern metropolitan existence, Simmel argued, was distinguished by a sheer
‘intensiﬁcation of nervous stimulation which results from the swift and uninterrupted change of outer and inner stimuli (1964 [1903]: 410; emphasis in
original). The metropolitan citizen is endlessly caught up in a whirl of jarring
stimuli – forcing ‘the nerves so brutally hither and thither that their last reserves
of strength are spent’ (1964: 414). The crucial question for that citizen was how
she was to adapt to ‘the rapid crowding of changing images . . . and the unexpectedness of onrushing impressions’ – as against ‘the rhythm of life’ in rural
areas which ‘ﬂows more slowly, more habitually and more evenly’ (1964: 410).
To live well in a city of nerves, for Simmel, was to avoid being ‘levelled down and
worn out by a social-technological mechanism’ – for ‘man’ (sic.) to ‘develo[p]
an organ protecting him against the threatening currents and discrepancies
of his external life which would uproot him’ (1964: 409–410). Of course, one
might wonder what, exactly, Simmel meant by ‘the nerves’ – whether this was
the ‘nerves’ of the nineteenth-century neurologists, the nerves of neurasthenia
or nervous exhaustion, the nerves that were disturbed in hysteria, improved by
so many elixirs, weakened by masturbation and vice, stiffened by discipline and
exercise, and so on. Yet there is no doubt that, for Simmel, the space of action
for urban experience was an organic one – it was the body that registered these
sensations, and that formed the key line of defence against them.
In that same year, Ernest W. White, Professor of Psychological Medicine at
King’s College London, and Superintendent of the City of London Asylum at
Stone, gave a Presidential address to the Medico Psychological Association (later
the Royal College of Psychiatrists) in London. In his speech, White ﬁxed on a
rapid increase in the number of the insane in the years leading up to his sinecure
– and especially of the urban insane. The Lunacy Commissioner’s Blue Book, he
told his audience, showed that the average annual increase of the insane in the
county of London alone was then about 500 per year; that between 1859 and
1902, the rate of lunacy had almost doubled; and that, in spite of rapid improvement in the environments of the insane, as well as the application of rational
principles of treatment, there had been ‘no material advance in the recovery rate’
of mental patients (E.W. White, 1903: 592–593). White had a number of explanations for this phenomenon (not least, needless to say, the weakening of the
English ‘race’ via intermarriage with neurotic aliens). But it was the environment especially that caught White’s attention: ‘The population,’ he pointed out,
‘is urban rather than rural to-day . . .
We are rapidly becoming town-dwellers. Overcrowding is common. The people breathe
less pure air and have less outdoor exercise under the beneﬁcent action of the sun’s rays
. . . the stress of life is far greater than formerly . . . late hours and overexcitement must
leave their marks upon the race as well as upon the individual. (1903: 595)

The fact was, argued White, England was no longer a land of stout, neurosisfree, hamlet-dwelling yeomen. It had become overrun with ‘needy town-dwellers
of poor physique, with neurotic inheritance and frequently with constitutions
undermined by disease’ (1903: 593).

Living well in the Neuropolis

White’s contribution reminds us that the relations between biological thought
and urban life have often been grim. We are especially reminded of the
nineteenth-century image of a degenerative urban underclass associated with the
work of Bénédict Morel, which informed Emil Kraepelin’s psychiatric nosology
– and Kraepelin himself, of course, was trying to shift the relations between biological, psychiatric and social phenomena in this period (Roelcke, 1997). It was,
moreover, the characteristically syphilitic and alcoholic nature of urban life that,
for scholars in this period, warped the human ‘germ’: Kraepelin’s student, Ernst
Rüdin, who became speciﬁcally concerned with urban form, played an important
role in the 1934 Nazi sterilization law (Roelcke, 1997). This is of course much too
complex a history for us to do justice to (see Pick, 1989, for a comprehensive account). As Christopher Lawrence (2009) has shown, degeneration was a master
concept of the Victorian and Edwardian world – cutting across the social and
biological sciences in heterogeneous ways. Amid such indeterminacy, Lawrence
argues, lines of causation are hard to deduce: ‘such ideologies were contingent;
there was no necessary move from the lab to the slum’ (2009: 456). In what follows, we will not paper over this history. Nor will we suggest that what was at
stake was ‘really’ a more benign account of urban neurosis. But we are trying to
ﬁnd new paths through this heterogeneous archive. If the degeneracy of the urban
slum is one (often horriﬁc) ending point for this story, one part of our question
is about whether other narratives might yet be disentangled from this corpus.
At the beginning of the twentieth century then, and within the depths of the
still-emerging modern metropolis (this is also the era of Charles Baudelaire’s
Parisian Scenes, of Walter Benjamin’s Arcades, of Charlie Chaplin’s Modern
Times) a range of scholars, physicians and artists were beginning to notice not
only a relationship between urbanicity and mentality; they were also starting to
pick out some more speciﬁc, more pronounced, and more troublesome circuits
of exchange. Why was it in the city particularly, as William White asked the National Geographic Society in 1903, that ‘the weakling, the man whose mental
faculties are not quite up to grade . . . goes to the wall?’ (W. White, 1903: 278).

The psychological city
Such nervous tensions were felt in a great deal of scholarly work in the century
that followed. In a related paper (Fitzgerald et al., 2016) we describe how they
were particularly important for what became known (in sociology) as the Chicago
School, and the forms of ecological and urban sociology associated with it. Here,
our focus is on imaginations of urban space – on what kind of thing the city is
understood to be vis-à-vis the faculties, propensities and anxieties of the people
who happen to live in it. One way that such concerns emerged was via images of
the city as a psychological space. There is much to be said about the transition
from the study of the neuroses to the discipline that we today call psychology
– and about the historical weft in how we understand the objects that persist
through these transitions. We cannot here do any justice to that story. But the
seminal work of Louis Wirth is as good as any to mark the passage from an earlier

proto-sociological and proto-psychological literature into a full-blown psychology of the city. In Urbanism as a Way of Life (1938), Wirth insisted that a sociological account of the city must move beyond its physical form, to take note of
the ‘personality’ that inhabits it. And this personality was not in a happy state:
‘The necessary frequent movement of great numbers of individuals in a congested
habitat gives occasion to friction and irritation’, Wirth wrote: ‘nervous tensions
which derive from such personal frustrations are accentuated by the rapid tempo
and the complicated technology under which life in dense areas must be lived’
(1938: 16).
Wirth’s paper was heavily criticized (Guterman, 1969), but his analysis provided one of the key reference points for Stanley Milgram’s provocative paper of
1970, The Experience of Living in Cities. Milgram (like Simmel) was interested
in the adaptive mechanisms necessary to protect the individual from the sensory
overload of city life. But it was the social life of the city that started Milgram’s
analysis – and the question of how an urban personality, as well as a moral career,
gets produced by that life (1970: 1462). Milgram especially tried to understand
how cities reshape encounters with those categorized as friends and strangers –
and how these categorizations inﬂuence whether or not a person intervenes in another’s troubles, how they manage the conﬂicts between privacy, engagement and
co-operation, and, in general, how they live within the tolerance generated by urban existence, the vicissitudes of vulnerability, the transformation of civility, and
so on. Perhaps Milgram’s most striking intervention was to refuse a demarcation
of the city on the basis of demographic or geographic indices. Following the classic work of Kevin Lynch (1960), Milgram drew attention to how we apprehend
the images and symbols with which urban experiences saturate our cognitive and
visual faculties: ‘Like the Sherpa’, Lynch had written,
we see only the sides of Everest and not the mountain. To extend and deepen our perception of the environment would be to continue a long biological and cultural development which has gone from the contact senses to the distant senses to symbolic
communication. (1960: 12)

What distinguishes the cognitive map of the city, for Lynch as for Milgram, is
that we make the environment: the biological and mental work of cognitive mapmapping is always in transaction with the physical (and political) labour of citymaking. ‘It is an ancient habit to adjust to our environment,’ Lynch argued:
Survival and dominance based themselves on this sensuous adaptability, yet now we
may go on to a new phase of this interaction. On home grounds, we may begin to adapt
the environment itself to the perceptual pattern and symbolic process of the human
being. (1960: 95)

Milgram (1970) was very much alive to the socio-political potency of Lynch’s proposal, drawing attention to how, for example, racialized housing policies might
afford different teenagers, in a single city, very different cognitive maps of the
same space.

Living well in the Neuropolis

This psychological and cognitive city made its presence felt in several literatures that developed through the 1970s, including an emergent environmental psychology (Craik, 1973), attentions to the crowded noise of cities (Altman,
1975), and anxiety about the forms of alienation engendered by those crowds
(Seeman, 1975). For others who followed Milgram, stress was the key (Glass and
Singer, 1972). Indeed, in a 1978 special issue of Urban Ecology, Amos Rapoport
set out a new model of the stressful urban environment – insisting that a subjective perception of particular urban features and cues modulates the stress relationship: noise and density might well be stressors in a residential area, but
they might equally be actively sought out in a theatre district (1978: 242). In the
years that followed, the literature on urban stress developed rapidly – focusing
on noise (Cohen and Lezak, 1977), crowds (Schopler and Stockdale, 1977), and
information (Lipowski, 1971), among other topics. But perhaps the most distinctive contribution came from John B. Calhoun’s experiments on the stressful
effects of crowding in model rat cities (Calhoun, 1962, 1973). In his excellent
history of Calhoun’s experiments, Edmund Ramsden has shown how Calhoun’s
model environment – the ‘rat utopia’ – came to mimic a human city to the extent
that it was made up of ‘tower blocks, cafeterias, and congested stairwells’, riven
with ‘social pressure’ and ‘social strife’, populated by interweaving networks of
‘social dropouts’, ‘bar-ﬂies’, ‘autistics’ and female ‘amazons’ (Ramsden, 2011:
661, 664, 668).
Of course, we can only skate thinly across a complex history. Nonetheless,
we suggest that, by the 1980s, the idea that the physical and political contours of
urban space shape the interior world of city dwellers was well established. A thick,
multi-stranded literature showed, in many different ways, how the encounters
experienced by those who live in urban environments (of many different sorts)
actually moulded their interior worlds, leaving durable impressions upon their
souls. And this process was well charted at multiple levels, from the ethnographic
to the epidemiological. ‘The city’ had stopped being only a geographical, spatial,
political, commercial and economic reality. It had become a psychological and a
psychiatric phenomenon too.

The neurological city
In 2005, in Chiba prefecture in Japan, a team of researchers took 17 female
participants out for a walk. First they went to a forested area. Then they walked
around an urban station in Chiba City. At different points during the day, the
researchers used a new brain-imaging technology, Near-Infrared Time-Resolved
Spectroscopy, to measure absolute volumes of haemoglobin in brain tissue –
thus comparing the effects of walking in the two different areas, vis-à-vis the
participants’ brain physiology (Tsunetsugu and Miyazaki, 2005). As it happened, signiﬁcantly lower levels of haemoglobin were detected for the forest as
opposed to the city areas after walking – showing, the authors argued, ‘that in a
forest environment, the activity in the prefrontal region was calmer than in a city
environment’ (2005: 469). Interestingly, what concerned these researchers (from

Japan’s Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute) was not the neural
effects of urban experience, but that of the forest (cf. Tsunetsugu et al., 2007).
A few years later, a group of researchers at Chonnam University in Gwangju,
South Korea, used fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) to measure
the brain activation of a series of participants, while they looked at images of
variously rural (‘forests, gardens, parks and hills’) and urban (‘high buildings,
offices, electrical cables, garbage collections’) scenes (T.-H. Kim et al., 2010). In
this case, while viewing rural scenery, the participants showed greater activity in
areas of the basal ganglia, ‘important for positive emotions’; by contrast, when
looking at urban scenes, participants showed activity in brain areas associated
with aversive imagery and with evaluating cues that might predict danger (2010:
2606). Thus, the authors argued, participants showed ‘an inherent preference
towards nature-friendly living’ (2010: 2607). Their ﬁndings, they concluded in
another paper published the same year,
support the idea that the differential functional neuroanatomies for each scenic view
are presumably related with subjects’ emotional responses to the natural and urban
environment, and thus the differential functional neuroanatomy can be utilized as a
neural index for the evaluation of friendliness in ecological housing. (G.-W. Kim et al.,
2010: 507)

If the city jangles the nerves, then so might swards of green give the opposite
effect. At least, this seems to have been the intuition behind an experiment conducted in Edinburgh a couple of years later (Aspinall et al., 2013). First, these
researchers mapped a short walk that would take twelve people (individually)
through three distinct areas of Edinburgh: an urban shopping street with light
traffic, a green space with lawns and trees, and a busy commercial district. Participants wore a portable Emotiv EPOCTM ‘wireless EEG’ headset – which recorded
electrical activity at 14 different locations on the skull, using a proprietary algorithm that translated EEG data into four ‘emotional parameters’, namely frustration, engagement, excitement and meditation. Following the walk, the researchers correlated the output from the devices with the participants’ presence
in the different zones: how did different experiences of the environment correlate
with the algorithms representing people’s emotional states? The most signiﬁcant
ﬁnding showed a marked difference in activity as people moved from busy streets
to quiet green areas: ‘the transition from Zone 1 to Zone 2 (urban shopping street
to green space) . . . [shows] reductions in arousal, frustration and engagement (i.e.
directed attention) and an increase in meditation’ (2013: 5). The authors proposed that, in the future, studies like theirs might be ‘particularly beneﬁcial in
exploring the health improving potential of environments while people are on
the move’ (2013: 5).
No doubt there are many remarks that may be made here. But what we want to
focus on is the form of reasoning through which something like an ‘urban brain’
gets brought into being, as well as the set of spatial and topographic relationships
within which that organ is suspended. At its heart, what this paper does is sketch
out the ‘urban brain’ as a kind of linear and ambulatory organ – one shaped and

mediated by the directly affective relationship that it co-constructs with the environment in which it ﬁnds itself. If this kind of ‘co-construction’ is now something
of a truism in brain research, the process seems to be especially potent in relation to cities, presenting the urban experience as a transition through shifting,
changeable zones of jarring hubbub and restorative calm. But more importantly,
these studies – and they are only a small selection – offer us a novel way of imagining and mapping the shape of our cities. They provoke us to see those cities as
intertwined zones of arousal and meditation, even to map the city in the brain, as
the urban citizen winds her way – here, noisily frustrated; there, calmly restored
– through its different spaces.
But, of course, we hear the critical voice stirring: why the brain? What does
what we here call the Neuropolis add to what we have known from those such as
Simmel, and Wirth, and Calhoun, and Milgram, and indeed a much vaster sociological, psychological and social psychological literature on urban experience
than we have been able to parse here? In the short space that remains, we will
offer an account of why we take this neurological turn to be signiﬁcant, as well
as what we think is added by insisting on this vexed, equivocal portmanteau, the
Neuropolis. We will make two moves: (1) following some now-classic arguments
in the sociology of the biosciences, we will argue that there is an important form
of political subjectivity at stake in the Neuropolis: more directly than even the
very rich and nuanced social psychology of the 1970s, what we call the Neuropolis
signiﬁes an important space of intervention within the nexus of urban subjectivity, sociality and governance. (2) At the same time, this neurobiological research
calls attention to the materiality – and presence – of the space in question. Confronted by that presence, and working in its shadow, we want to ﬁnd some more
creative modes for thinking with, through, along and around the Neuropolis –
even to seek some affirmative possibilities within the assemblages that comprise
it. Recalling the hopes that ﬁgures as diverse as Georg Simmel, Louis Wirth and
Stanley Milgram sustained for improving city life – could a turn to the Neuropolis
even tell us something about living well in the stressful city?

Shaping the nervous city
Let us return to the Nature commentary by Alison Abbot. In her article,
Abbott suggests that nothing less than ‘the future of the city’ is at stake in
the neuroscience of urbanicity (2012: 164). ‘We know far too little about the
city at the moment,’ an architect and city-planner tells Abbott: ‘We need these
new technologies and approaches to help us make decisions about how the
city should best be developed’ (2012: 164). ‘The question is an urgent one,’
Abbott herself goes on ‘ . . . as well as helping in the design of future cities,

captions describing their affective states: one, marked as ‘Relaxed’, is depicted
on a green square beside a tree; a huddle of ﬁgures in the middle distance
are identiﬁed as ‘Anxious’, while two more forlorn ﬁgures, far off to the right
of the image, are marked as ‘Isolated’ and ‘Lonely’, respectively. A caption
hovering above the last of these informs us that ‘feeling different to neighbours
– owing to socioeconomic status or ethnicity – may be a factor. Immigrant
populations have an increased risk of psychiatric disease’ (see Abbott, 2012:
164).
The urban, here, is ﬁgured not as a space of cosmopolitan mingling, of civilized living, commercial vitality, cultural effervescence, and so on, but as a medicalized (or rather ‘psychiatrized’) space of potential pathogenesis, whose effects
might yet be rendered visible, ﬁrst in the forms of comportment that are peculiar to pathological urban subjects and, second, in the development and function of those subjects’ wounded brains. And in the same moment as disorder is
mapped onto urban spaces, intervention and management are called for. The
Neuropolis, that is to say, is not merely a mode of representation; it is a call
for action. Launching a programme by the International Council for Science
in late 2014, Anthony Capon explained to journalists how cities were associated with growing problems in non-communicable disease and mental health:
‘The essence of this [Urban Health and Wellbeing] programme,’ Capon said, is
about:
scientists working with urban decision makers. It is about identifying problems together, and how we might better understand those problems and developing better
ways of responding to rapid urban population growth. (quoted in Kinver, 2014)

Indeed, the psychiatrist Mazda Adli has argued that
if major social stressors, such as certain aspects of population density and hazardous
social gradients, are proven to be health-threatening, we should be able to moderate
population exposure and have an impact on the urban population’s . . . increased risk
of mental health problems. (Adli, 2011)

Pointing out that brains and cities are equally – and independently – complex
structures, and that very different kinds of stressors are likely to be present in
low- and middle-income countries, Adli is careful not to be more prescriptive
than this. Richard Coyne, a professor of architectural computing at Edinburgh
College of Art, and a co-author of the paper that tracked mobile EEG measures
in Edinburgh, drew some clearer conclusions from that paper on his blog. ‘Our
study,’ wrote Coyne,
has implications for promoting urban green space to enhance mood, important in encouraging people to walk more or engage in other forms of physical or reﬂective activity. More green plazas, parkland, trees, access to the countryside, and urban design
and architecture that incorporates more of the atmosphere of outdoor open space are
all good for our health and wellbeing. (Coyne, 2013)

Living well in the Neuropolis

If these prescriptions seem rather ordinary, the form of reasoning (ie from
brain-imaging study of urban space to policy proposals on the urban landscape) is rather less so. Others have used what we know about the relationship between demographics and psychiatric illness to generate predictive maps:
PsyMaptic, an epidemiological prediction tool, supported by the Wellcome Trust
and the NHS, uses socio-demographic and socio-environmental factors to predict episodes of ﬁrst-episode psychosis in speciﬁc districts. ‘Until now,’ the creators point out, ‘healthcare policy makers, commissioners and planners have
not had access to accurate information regarding the level of new cases of psychotic disorder expected in different regions of England & Wales’ (PsyMaptic,
n.d.).
Of course, these interventions are very different from one another, and are not
part of any single project for ‘governing the Neuropolis’. Yet it is clear that what
we call the Neuropolis is not a mere intellectual construction; it is also an interventionist imagination of the future city – of its shape and its demographics, its
services and its parklands, its problems and its priorities – based on a commitment to managing the relationship between the city, the person and the brain.
In itself, this marks an important transition point: if, a century ago, intellectuals argued that cures for the ills inherent in urban existence required a focus on
pathological urban immigrants, the prescription today is much more likely to be
about the presence of green spaces, and the density of particular areas, rates of
poverty and welfare dependency, the preponderance of loneliness, and so on.3
Research on the urban brain, that is to say, does not simply attempt to know and
manage the incidence of mental disorder in the city; it is also part of a broad,
heterogeneous trend of thought that is bringing cities into existence as neural
phenomena, and not only spatial ones. The Neuropolis contains within it the aspiration to create a good city, understood here as a city that fosters healthy neurological functioning in its citizens, and thereby a space that fosters individual
and collective ﬂourishing. The neurobiological life of the urban citizen has become a problem to be resolved, and an opportunity to be optimized, through city
policy.
And yet the rise of the Neuropolis is not only of interest because of this revised
image of the biological citizen that it embodies. It is also interesting because,
precisely through this move that links the neurobiological to the spatial and the
governmental – that renders the spatial neurobiological in terms of a preconscious cognitive map structuring an experience that might yet be modiﬁed – it
offers the possibility of a relation with the social sciences that goes beyond genealogy or critique. In the ﬁnal section of this paper, we offer a more generous
and imaginative reading from sociology of this neurobiological turn. This is not
because we think a biopolitical reading is inaccurate (it is not), but rather because
we think, to paraphrase Didier Fassin (2009) that another biopolitics is possible
– that there is perhaps yet an affirmative sociology to be recovered from these
recent interventions, especially as they ask us to think, even if only in one very
speciﬁc way, about how exactly we want to conceptualize, measure and shape a
good urban life.

The biopolitics of urban utopia
In an essay on how we are to think ‘the good city’, Ash Amin asks us to ‘look
at the contradictions and possibilities of our times as the material of a politics
of well-being and emancipation that is neither totalising nor teleological’ (2006:
1010). Noting the accelerating processes of urbanization in many countries, Amin
wonders if we cannot think the contemporary city as ‘the topos of . . . [a] more
pragmatic interpretation of the good life’ (2006: 1011). If cities are still too often
‘polluted, unhealthy, tiring, overwhelming, confusing [and] alienating’, still the
‘“being-togetherness” of life in urban space has to be recognised, demanding attendance to the politics of living together’ (2006: 1011–1012). For Amin, a pragmatic politics of urban utopia calls attention to mundane realignments already
underway in many cities; he focuses on the possibilities that lie within the commons of the city and its civic sociality, including the ‘technological unconscious’
of its infrastructure, to help us imagine – both for the global ‘north’ and ‘south’
– much richer assemblages of participation, solidarity, enchantment and dissent.
We are with Amin in his attempt to imagine a pragmatic utopia through and
with the contemporary city. But we also want to explore how this might enable
us to think a neurological politics of urban space. What would it mean to begin
thinking a biopolitics of ‘being-together’ in urban space? This requires us to recognize that the idea of ‘biopolitics’ not only points us to a variety of arts for governing populations, but also embodies a normativity about the politics of health.
A positive biopolitics of urban space requires us to think normatively about the
ways in which the city composes relations among developing brains, sick bodies,
internal maps, stressed citizens and toxic spaces. Of course, we know where the
sometimes-biological project of liberal democracy has often ended (Rose, 2001:
5). But if we are tentative about pursuing such a biopolitics, and about working
through the normative language in which it is couched, still we are in search of
a sociology that – as Robyn Wiegman and Elizabeth Wilson recently proposed
in another context – ‘seeks to encounter normativity on something other than
oppositional terms’ (2015: 2). Can thinking through the Neuropolis, then, begin
to winch us across these anxieties, and help us to think about what it means to
‘live well’ in ‘the good city’? Can it direct us towards experimental interventions
that actually illuminate the ways that the city presses on, and is impressed by, the
cerebral lives of urban citizens?
What is at stake for us, in this Neuropolitan vision, is something close to what
Tim Choy (2012), in his ethnography of environmental concern in Hong Kong,
calls an ‘ecological politics.’ For Choy, such a politics does not simply describe
the struggle between different interests over the terms of environmental debate.
Instead, it is a way of thinking and acting that is more thickly embedded in
‘questions and comparisons, acts that recast the relations – of nature, culture,
politics and more – through which a given animal, plant, health problem,
landscape, or question comes to matter epistemically and politically’ (2012: 11).
Choy uses this concept to pose hard questions about how we might understand
– and intervene in – ‘ecology’ as sociologists. In particular, and against a view of

the environment as the product of particular formations of politics and society,
he asks: ‘what might we see if we tried not only to read the terms and logics of
ecology through sociology, but also to read sociology through ecology?’ (2012:
63). Taking this question into, for example, an analysis of urban air, Choy argues
that attending to the relationship between social theory and air
turns Hong Kong into something like a natural object, something nearly elemental.
The city’s mercantile and military origins become almost atmospheric, a storm depicted by layers of clouds and a sky ﬁlled with ﬂashes and roars. (2012: 140)

Paying theoretical attention to the quality – and to the health consequences – of
urban air, for Choy, confronts us with ‘the moment when wind opens the body
to ailments’ (2012: 157). Urban bodies, in sickness and in health, are not only
interpellated by a sociopolitics of space; they also become
an intimate location of effects and agencies . . . air is the substance that bathes and ties
the scales of body, region, and globe together . . . . that subsequently enables personal
and political claims to be scaled up, to global environmental politics, and down, to the
politics of health. (2012: 157)

Just as Ash Amin helps us to attend to the complex, lived pragmatics of contemporary urban utopias, so does Tim Choy insist that thinking good life in the city
also requires us to understand how bodies are permeated through atmospheres
and environments. He shows us how the ecology of the city is not simply a product of its society or its politics, but is a much more entangled terrain, one in which
very different sorts of claims to health, well-being, and justice can come to matter. Such an ecological politics of bodies-through-environments can help us to
recast our attention to the ecological effects of brains-in-cities; it can help us, as
sociologists, to attend in new ways to the politics of urban mental health; and it
invites us to challenge not only the disembodied abstractions of much contemporary neurobiology, but also the decorporealized subjects of much contemporary
sociology. It might even help us to see and map these relations, and potentially
to intervene on them. This is the promise that we are trying to enclose within the
term, Neuropolis.
We are tempted here to invert well-known accounts of ‘biological citizenship’
and ‘biocitizenship’ (Rose and Novas, 2007; Petryna, 2002). To again paraphrase
Didier Fassin, we might try to turn these accounts – from analyses of the rules of
the game to instructions on how best to intervene in the game itself (2009: 52).
These analyses remind us that to demand recognition as a citizen – to make the
claims entailed by that recognition – has long required some account of the relations between a body and its environment. The point is that an ecological politics
of the Neuropolis would not merely draw our attention to an under-explored historical territory, where the traces of social life have always been visible in their
impressions on the nervous system. It would also attempt to render the intuition
that urban living marks us in body and soul more concretely – using it to parse
questions of anxiety, fragility and stress as they become legible in the urban brain.
Crucially, it would invite affiliation with an experimental and clinical literature

that is currently trying to think through the biologically lived, developmentally
potent stress of urban life. If urban citizenship can indeed be instantiated neurobiologically, then neuroscientiﬁc measures might help us to clarify what we
might hope for in ‘living well’ in the contemporary city – not through a focus
on disembodied and abstracted brains, but by reconceptualizing the politics of
the city in terms of strategies for intervening in spaces both inside and outside
the skull. In addition to long-standing demands for justice at the socio-economic
margins of our cities, what would happen if we were called to new forms of attention, accountability and action, through speciﬁcally Neuropolitan claims to
urban mutuality and solidarity?

Conclusion: for Neuropolitanism
In this paper we have tried to avoid the twin lures of monotonous critique and
excitable enthusiasm. Instead, we have tried to pick our way across some of the
conceptual, scientiﬁc and political complexity in which the ‘urban brain’ is taking shape. This neurobiological work is still at a relatively early stage, and it does
not easily lend itself to any kind of ﬁrm diagnosis. Still we are trying, to borrow a
term from Donna Haraway (2010), to ‘stay with the trouble’ of the urban brain.
Our aim is to attend to the complexity and the ambiguity; to refuse the invitation
to be either excited or appalled; to sidestep the inviting, but totally misleading,
division of history – namely: on the one hand, a reductive bio-determinist past
and, on the other, an open bio-curious future. We want to point to some important and suggestive continuities, as well as to the potentially progressive political
possibilities, that might yet lie within a contemporary neuropolitics of urban experience.
We ﬁnd much to agree with in Maurizio Meloni’s diagnosis of recent
epistemological shifts in the biosciences – in evolutionary theory, molecular
epigenetics, neuroplasticity and elsewhere, as well as his suggestion that these
should mark the beginning of ‘a sociological-cum-biological research program’
(2014: 743; cf. Rose, 2013). But we suggest that the history of relations between
biological and social explanations is more complex – and more hopeful – than
he allows. We do not, in fact, need to place our hopes in some epistemological
revolution, or in the biosocial future it will usher in. Contemporary hopes and
enthusiasms should not be allowed to ignore more positive (albeit often fugitive)
transactions in the long history of biosocial exchange. We want to avoid consigning ﬁgures as diverse as Louis Wirth, John Calhoun and Stanley Milgram
to a forgotten past, just as we are reluctant to embrace molecular epigenetics or
neuroplasticity as – at last! – the royal road to a brighter future. The past is more
complicated, the present more ambiguous, and the future more uncertain, than
any of this allows. We are profoundly concerned with the contemporary, with the
neuropathologies of the stressed city worker in her harassed passage, the isolated
ageing city dweller in her high-rise apartment – and so many other ﬁgures on the
contemporary urban scene. But we also want to keep our eyes on the domineering rat amazons of Washington DC in the 1970s; on the neurosyphilis patients

lurking around the vice resorts of Chicago in the 1930s; on Georg Simmel’s blasé
cosmopolitans, on Edmund White’s needy town-dwellers – and, even beyond
these, to a whole panoply of neuropsychiatric and epidemiological work on the
psychogenic effects of city life, extending well back into the nineteenth century,
and to a much wider, non-Euro-American territory than we have been able to
elucidate here. The Neuropolis is old, and winding. It’s easy to get lost there. To
think about good life in such a space means not only grappling with history, but
also coming to terms with a complex simultaneity of past and present – of the
ideas, people and inclinations, that persist, in the shadows, across them.

pathological heredity of these newcomers, and more to the ways in which immigration indexes
broader social problems.
