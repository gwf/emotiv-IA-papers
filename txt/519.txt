Abstract
The cognitive approach of learning agrees in that behavior of the individual correlates with certain complex and dynamic
mental processing operations modulated by certain internal mechanisms learned or improved during life. Applied to
university learning, the demand towards students no longer focuses only in the results of the process but, ideally, in the
development of individual styles based on cognitive preferences and learning strategies. Several tests such as Kolb and
VAK or Hermann dominances allow distinguishing some learning styles such as: Divergent, Assimilator, Convergent and
Accommodator; Visual; Kinesthetic; and Auditory. Meanwhile, by using electrophysiological tools like an
electroencephalographic (EEG) recording it is now possible to measure individual differences in the varying electrical
activity present in the cerebral cortex while a student face a cognitive problem or performs a test of intelligence. In this
study, we tested 20 students from their early years of engineering to be classified in three systems of learning styles. The
students were then subjected to a test of intelligence (Raven test, abbreviated version of 15 questions) with increasing levels
of complexity. The time length to solve the test taken for students previously classified in four main styles yielded by the
Kolb test, were analyzed. Then we grouped them by correspondences with the visual, auditory and kinesthetic
predominance yielded by the VAK test. The response time was measured and the absolute frequency of response time for
each question was calculated. During the Raven test execution an electroencephalogram with Emotiv Epoc Brain-Computer
Interface of 14 channels was recorded. After subtracting baseline and eliminating common artifacts with the help of
EEGLAB toolbox under Matlab, we obtained clean signals for theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands. Using the set of
learning styles classificatory tools and the electrophysiological analysis we started to look for variability and consistencies
that support or rise new questions about adequate usefulness of common used psycho-cognitive and behavioral learning
styles tests. In our sample we found relatively low discriminative resolution from all learning styles test applied, but a
promising research field to study electrical brain activity phenomenology associated with learning and solving problem
strategies of the brain.

1. Introduction
The performance of a human being in solving a problem that involves cognitive processing is determined by
a neuro-cognitive individuality which is being built during the progressive (or regressive) brain development.
Several of these individualities are usually present in a cryptic status and, in teaching-learning environments,
they are hardly noticeable for teachers in the classroom as to using this information to plan or improve
educational process. To find some of these hidden variables we may need to turn more explicit the neurocognitive mechanism underlying problem solving processing occurring in the brain. We can do this through the
study of a set of biometric variables whose correlations and phenomenology can enlighten our understanding of
the individual functional processes taking place in the brain. A better understanding and monitoring of such
processes would help to select and support improved variants or new teaching strategies inspired in the
acquired knowledge coming from this field research. It is expected that this improvement in knowing
underlying cognitive problem solving processes that may help to explain cognitive individualities will impact
positively on the improvement, efficiency and effectiveness of teaching and learning processes.
To classify inter-individual differences and to group them into categories of learning strategies, there has
been developed several theories, for example, Gardner´s multiple intelligences, which in principle considers
eight different ways to deal with knowledge acquisition [1]. According to this idea eight different types of skills
or intelligences can be distinguished. These define the way(s) each individual faces, understands, deals, or tries
to solve a given problem or a particular cognitive or behavioral challenge. The eight kinds of intelligences
proposed are: linguistic; logical-mathematical; spatial; musical; corporal-kinesthetic; intra-personal;
interpersonal; and naturalistic. Since this initial classification, other authors also have defined and grouped
human diversity in the context of knowledge acquisition and processing preferences in learning. Such is the
case of the classification coming from neurolinguistic programming (NLP) that classifies individuals into three
categories according to their preferred way to capture and process information from the environment [2]. Here,
people can be classified as visual, auditory or kinesthetic, depending on which sense dominates on the initial
data acquisition and processing of information. In another proposal, Kolb developed a scheme of four
orthogonal axes whose quadrants define a combination of preferences or styles that determine a specific way to
deal with problem solving [3]. In this scheme, a person can have one, or a combination, of the following styles:
accommodator; convergent; assimilator; and divergent, according to his/her preference for: concrete experience;
active experimentation; abstract conceptualization; and reflective observation (Fig 1). Another system proposed
by Alonso [4] classifies people in: reflective; pragmatic; active; and theoretical. All categories intersect each
other to some extent with the models mentioned above.

Other authors incorporate a biological-evolutionary component concerning development of cognitive and
learning processing, integrating the results of several contemporary neurophysiologists who argue that the
cerebral cortex exert voluntary control over the emotional aspects [5-6-7]. In this sense, in the model of "brain
dominances", Herrmann proposes that the brain works in four predominant operating modules that meet certain
broad localization in the brain [8]. Thus, brain is divided into four modules: two frontal regions (left and right)

19

20

and two inferior or lateral regions (left and right) [9]. Frontal regions correspond to the part of the cortex that
specializes in modulating and control of emotions where rationality, planning and foresight are included; while
lower regions are related to less modulated emotions and interpersonal skills.
The development of techniques to measure brain function has been mainly related to the study and diagnosis
of developmental disorders and/or learning dysfunctions [10-11-12]. In our context it would be useful to create
a broader classification tool that includes non-diagnosed or medically treated people, to establish first a local
baseline framework against with to compare. In a teaching context, to count with such a characterization of
cognitive variability and brain processing preferences must encourage education researchers to take advantage
of it including as well the value and importance of emotions, it plays a role either helping or hindering the
learning process and development [13-14]. In his classical approach, Piaget identified stages of cognitive
development, depending on the age, for handling scientific knowledge, integrating these findings into the
practice of learning and teaching in the school [15]. The progressive ease of implementing a model which can
allows us to test, analyze and diagnose brain functional states by using simple brain-computer interfaces
facilitates the nowadays access to the study of the brain processes involved in different aspects of learning.
Current technological advances has allowed researchers to mine into the cryptic aspects of this process
revealing, identifying and using neuro-cognitive and behavioral correlates for brain control of a machine [16].
All the information that has coming to light in this rather new research field can be used to improve our
knowledge of teaching-learning process by using that evidence to understand, implement and test teaching
strategies built on a neuroscience applied to practical (and not only theoretical) solutions for education. Braincomputer-machine interfaces expand the capacity of engineer and neurobiology to follow, record, and
statistically explore the signal of brain activity, during its ongoing functional coupling with the environment in
daily-life circumstances. To date there are rather few applications of recent finding oriented to education to
unveil more deeply the mid- and long-term intimacy of neuro-cognitive processes of students in the teachinglearning process [17]. By integrating neurophysiology and automatic has been possible to achieve powerful
applications which help to reveal part of this neuro-cognitive intimacy [18-19-20]. By using headbands to
record brain activity, it is possible to detect patterns of electroencephalographic response in front of the
challenge of learning. Concurrently, there has been a major breakthrough in the field of data analysis and
pattern recognition, attempting to identify correlations between neurophysiology and behavior in complex
environments [14]. Applied to teaching and learning processes it can help to improve the knowledge about
inter-individual differences and preferences in information processing strategies by students, to improve and
test new variants in teaching and learning strategies. In this paper we explore some of the individualities
involved in the process of solving a cognitive problem, analyzing the response time of the students solving 15
questions of a visual intelligence test (Raven Test, abbreviated version) while simultaneous EEG recording.
2. Method
2.1. Classification of learning styles in the experimental group
In order to diagnose the main cognitive styles involved in learning processing of first-year engineering
students, a group of 20 undergraduates were randomly chosen. Each student was also asked to answer a set of
psycho-behavioral tests (Kolb, VAK, and Herrmann´s Brain Dominances). The results of this analysis are
presented in a matrix composed of a set of variables associated with learning styles: visual (V), auditory (A),
kinesthetic (K), convergent, divergent assimilator, accommodator (K1, K2, K3, K4) and the 4 types of
Herrmann´s brain dominances (A, B, C, D).
2.2. Raven’s (abbreviated version) progressive matrices test
The Raven’s Progressive Matrices test is a non-verbal test which can be applied in individual or collective
situation. It consists of a number of problems in which the students selects missing pieces of a chart in order to
complete a drawing. Operationally, the task consists in compare forms and reason by analogy. The test used
corresponds to a shortened version (15 questions) of the original Raven´s test that is presented in the computer

21

screen. The responses are recorded in real time and then are reviewed to determine in which time frame each
matrix was answered.
2.3. EEG monitoring
To investigate the brain activity phenomenology during the test solving process and to search for
potential correlates between different classificatory variables and brain activity, we simultaneously recorded the
electroencephalographic signal (EEG) making possible to study some of the electrophysiological characteristics
of the brain signal during the whole response time period and during processing specific questions.
The EEG recording consisted in a basal, resting state, recording with open and closed eyes, minutes before
the initiation of the test execution. A further recording was captured during the whole resolution of the test.
We used the non-invasive brain computer device Emotiv EPOC® [21] to record 14 channels from head
locations according to the standard 10/20 system. After subtracting the baseline and eliminating common signal
artifacts with the help of EEGLAB and ADJUST [22] toolbox under Matlab, we obtained clean signals for the
theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands. These signals reflect the dynamics of each student's brain operation in
conditions of resting quiet awake and during the execution of the abbreviated version of Raven’s test.
2.4. Analysis of response time to the Raven test according to combination of learning styles
The results of the measurements were tabulated and entered into a database for further analysis using Matlab.
Response time in Raven’s test used by representative students of cognitive styles: convergent, divergent
assimilator and accommodator were analyzed, selecting the cases of visual preference rendered by VAK test.

As the Raven test is predominantly visual, students are grouped by VAK Learning Style in three clusters
using k-means with k = 3. The vector of the centroid for each VAK style is shown in Table 2.

Once separated in VAK categories: visual (subjects 1,7,8,10,16,18,20); kinesthetic (5,9,14,19); and auditory
(2,3,4,6,11,12,13,15,17), we considered the cluster of students with visual tendency first and this data was
crossed with the Kolb Learning Style classification.
Each point on the Kolb’s map of learning styles represents a vector in the plane. The Euclidean length of this
vector is calculated and then divided by the maximum score. The result is multiplied by 100 and the
"percentage of ownership within each quadrant (or Kolb type)" is obtained. Fig 2 shows the coordinates within
the quadrant corresponding to the Kolb’s Learning Style for 20 students. Results from the comparison of
"Visual students" with the Kolb classification are shown in Table 3.

Under the assumption that the response times in the Raven test for each student is a characteristic of the
student and with the aim to make response times comparable, response time for each matrix was normalized as
follows: the time spent on the solution of each matrix is divided by the total time spent in answering the Raven
test completely. The results are shown in Table 6. The normalized times are dimensionless since a partial time
is divided by a total time. Then, this table shows the absolute frequency of the response time for each matrix in
the Raven test.

The time spent to solve each Raven´s matrix represents a proxy measure for the load of cognitive process
involved in the problem solving task, or the relative difficulty that each matrix poses on each subject. Total
time spent is not a variable taken into account to estimate a range value for intelligence quotient (IQ) and
besides individual differences in the time spent solving each matrix, a general trend to higher cognitive load or
matrix difficulty is evident.
Fig 3 shows three examples of characteristic non-normalized time course development during solving 15
Raven´s matrices. Y axis represents time duration in seconds, while X axis order the correlative matrices
solved, M1 to M15.

Fig. 3. Three examples of representative time duration development for solving 15 Raven´s test matrices

IQ ranges yielded by the abbreviated version for Raven’s test does not group students in a clear classification
according Learning Styles but a slightly trend can be seen in the 95-120 IQ range where 7 out of 10 subjects
were categorized as visual according VAK test. Other IQ ranges have few subjects as to make a similar
tentative conclusion connecting Raven test results and learning preferences. Table 8 shows IQ range estimation
results.
Considering that Raven’s Test Matrices is a test of visual analogy solving problem task, it is possible that this
general tendency found in visual students in the 95-120 IQ range is a reflect of the constructive nature of the
test.

To have a descriptive visualization of the brain activity during the execution of the Raven test, we first
performed a channel spectra and map analysis of brain activity across all 15 questions (Q1 to Q15) of the test
(matrix of the Raven test). The analysis was made in the beta range (13-30 Hz) at 1Hz steps as it is shown in
Fig 4.
The technique draw a color map of the brain that shows the activity power spectral distribution for all the
Raven´s matrices in the beta range, represented as a color range where red color indicates high activation (+)

Felisa M. Córdova et al. / Procedia Computer Science 55 (2015) 18 – 27

and blue color high inhibition (-). Green color represents average values in between this range.
Further analysis of the color values of figure 5 suggests a progressive change in the way the brain treat each
matrix according to the degree of difficulty they presents. To check this out quantitatively we used image
analysis software (ImageJ) to measure the difference between RGB (Red/Green/Blue) values of the brain color
image maps across the matrices to compare the density color of activation (red) versus inhibition (blue), and
average power values (green).

Fig. 4. Channel spectra and map visualization of the beta band (13-30 Hz) of a representative subject brain activity during the execution of
Raven test (abbreviated version)

Fig 5 shows the questions time course of the changing channel spectra and map color configurations
revealing a specific trend for each color (brain activity) across the solving processing. The formula at the right
indicates the linear model that adjusts to the trend line.

Fig. 5. RGB density variation of channel spectra color maps across Raven test matrices Q1to Q15

It is fairly clear that along the execution of the test, inhibitory mechanisms reduce and concentrates,
progressively, the activation areas (+) to more localized zones compared with the first half of the test in which
activated areas looks widely distributed in the brain surface, before a progressive reduction and specific
localization of red color density. Concurrently, it is observed a raise of mean values and the expansion of
inhibitory areas (blue color). It seems that according to the increasing complexity of the problem to solve, the
working brain accommodates their functional resources concentrating them in those areas relevant for the

solving task, while minimizing the background noise coming from activation in other less relevant brain areas.
Conclusions
During the last decades learning and teaching in school or academic environments has been in the focus of
recent concern specially linked with the question of how to improve these basic processes which are at the core
of any educational phenomena [23]. Since more than two centuries educative system has been faithful to its
original conception, been immune to time passage, revolutions, technological advances, and industrial, digital,
information or knowledge eras. This sort of historical indolence has ended crystalizing an educative model
which is now being challenged from many directions all of them pointing out on how acquire more theoretical
and empirical knowledge about how people learn and how it is possible to improve education models based on
more personalized approaches. This kind of approach compels specialists to develop trustworthy tools to
determine specific individual differences and similarities among students with the aim to design personalized or
group-oriented teaching strategies that take advantage of the preferences or built-in-competences that students
manifests in the way how the brain acquire, process and make decisions in front of a problem that involves
information management.
In this field of exploration we tested three widely used psycho-cognitive and behavioral survey tools to try to
classify students of the first year of Engineering University program. None of the three surveys yielded clearcut satisfactory group classification for this sample based on learning styles. For the 20 subjects of the present
study it seems that preferences are shared in a roughly equivalent contribution in an average student, indicating
that, at this level of early expertise in the university context, there is not a clear difference for a particular
preference over a particular style. This can mean that all students may initially count with potentially
equivalent possibilities to manage and process information using any of the styles, or maybe a dynamical
combination of them, at least until when one or more specific preferences develops in time. Table 9 shows
centroid vector averages calculated for all students (*) and for the three learning styles surveys tested in this
study. The low coefficient of variation in all of them suggest that preferences in learning styles are more or less
evenly distributed than revealing a particular preferred tendency. For this sample, from the three surveys,
Hermann dominances rendered the less informative group classification.

The electrophysiological signal captured by mean of an EEG during the Raven test execution, revealed
progressive changes in the brain functional processing strategy through the rising of difficulty of the problem
faced. Under the hypothesis that a trained brain will tend to optimize processing (or energetic) resources for
information management it follows that this kind of electrophysiological approach can complement the
information needed to get a more precise panorama of the student´s brain working during solving a task.
Classification and identification of students in these integrative terms can lead to a new concept of cognitive
styles or preferences based on functional strategies directly measured from the working brain. This new
knowledge would allow teacher to improve teaching planning, selection of specific methodological strategies
or more effective support resources for the teaching-learning process.
