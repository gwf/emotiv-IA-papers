ABSTRACT
The use of virtual reality (VR) in transport research offers the opportunity to collect behavioural data in a
controlled dynamic setting. VR settings are useful in the context of hypothetical situations where realworld data does not exist and/or in situations which involve risk and safety issues making real-world data
collection infeasible. Nevertheless, VR studies can contribute to transport-related research only if the
behaviour elicited in a virtual environment closely resembles real-world behaviour. Importantly, as VR is
a relatively new research tool, the best-practice in terms of the experimental design is still to be
established. In this paper, we contribute to a better understanding of the implications of the choice of the
experimental setup by comparing cycling behaviour in VR between two groups of participants in similar
immersive scenarios – the first group controlling the manoeuvres using a keyboard and the other group
riding an instrumented bicycle. We critically compare the speed, acceleration, braking and head
movements of the participants in the two experiments. We also collect electroencephalography (EEG)
data to compare the alpha wave amplitudes and assess the engagement levels of participants in the two
settings. The results demonstrate the ability of VR to elicit behavioural patterns in line with those
observed in the real-world and indicate the importance of the experimental design in a VR environment
beyond the choice of audio-visual stimuli. The findings will be useful for researchers in designing the
experimental setup of the VR for behavioural data collection.

INTRODUCTION
Virtual reality (VR) has become an increasingly popular tool for travel behaviour research. This
is because in the transport domain, it is often inherently difficult to collect real-life data in hazardous road
circumstances. VR provides a high degree of experimental control, safety and ease of data collection,
while at the same time allowing to collect data in a dynamic setting. Further, as in other domains, VR
makes it possible to collect data in hypothetical future scenarios allowing to pre-test behavioural
responses in the context of new modes and novel urban design. Consequently, it has been widely used in
previous studies in a transport context. For example, Mai (1) evaluated VR as a tool to analyse pedestrian
behaviour at midblock crossings and Frankenhuis et al. (2) explored male risk-taking behaviour while
crossing a bridge in an immersive environment. Finally, Moussa et al. (3) tried to apply the Augmented
Reality Vehicle system to left-turn manoeuvres at two-way stop-controlled intersections.
Nevertheless, the potential disadvantages of VR include motion sickness, high costs and most
importantly, the risk of an unrealistic representation of reality. The ecological validity of VR experiments
is one of its main issues, as it is widely known that experimental designs which have a different degree of
immersion or employ different equipment can elicit distinct behavioural responses. For example, Farooq
et al. (4) elicited preferences over Connected and Autonomous Vehicles comparing three methods: an
immersive reality technology, a conventional visual presentation and text-only descriptions. The findings
showed that preference for autonomous vehicles increased from 40% in text-only case, through 50% in a
visual presentation to 70% if VR was used. It was concluded that preferences elicited with immersive
equipment were more consistent with real world preferences and the understanding of scenarios
improved. Furthermore, Bogacz et al. (5), which looked at the differences in risk processing between 2D
and 3D cycling scenarios in VR, showed that the behavioural patterns from the experiments were similar
to the actual behaviour of cyclists on the roads. Moreover, the study found that the propensity to brake
was higher in the 3D presentations compared to the 2D scenarios. Patterson et al. (6) conducted two
experiments to investigate the influence of the presentation method on neighbourhood choice. The first
one was based on the textual description of the living area, while the second used VR simulations of the
neighbourhood. The results showed that preferences elicited with text-only surveys reflected participants’
subjective, imagined illustration of the described place, whereas, in the case of the visualizations, the
preferences were based on the observed material. It suggests that VR technology allows for constructing
experimental scenarios that give the researcher more control over factors that affect the respondents’
choices, but at the same time these studies clearly exhibit the fact that preferences are highly dependent
on the presentation format. This effect is expected to be even stronger within immersive technology
experiments, as they engage individuals to a larger extent than traditional survey methods. However, as
VR is still an innovative and relatively new research tool, the best practices are yet to be established
especially in the light of mixed evidence in the existing literature.
In contrast, the domain of driving simulators represents an exception, as there has been extensive
research on the factors that affect the behavioural congruence in simulated driving. For instance,
Underwood et al. (7), who assessed the comparability of driving on a road and in a simulator, concluded
that driving simulators can demonstrate similar patterns of differences across drivers as observed on
actual roads. However, this was only relative, in the sense that they were unable to create the same
hazardous situations on a road as can be designed in a simulator. Furthermore, Godley (8) examined the
validity of driving simulators by comparing driving behaviour in an instrumented car vs a simulator. They
showed similar deceleration activity under both conditions. Yet, on the other hand, individuals tended to
drive faster in the instrumented car relative to the simulator. To the best of our knowledge, there has not
been any similar in-depth investigation on the factors that affect the behavioural congruence in the
context of different variants of immersive cycling environments.
In this paper, we address this research gap and contribute to a better understanding of the
implications of the choice of the experimental setup by comparing the cycling behaviour in VR between
two groups of participants in similar immersive scenarios – the first group controlling the manoeuvres
using a keyboard and the other group riding an instrumented bicycle.

These two types of equipment both have their advantages and drawbacks. The use of a keyboard
significantly reduces the cost of the experiment as well as the setup time but diminishes the realism of the
experiment. The employment of an instrumented bicycle in the experiment is more effort consuming and
requires novel engineering design (e.g. measuring wheel and pedal rotation, braking force etc.) and is not
portable. Nevertheless, the latter provides participants with an experience which resembles reality to a
larger extent and allows analysts to obtain richer data from the sensors installed on the bicycle.
This is also likely to be reflected in their neural activity, which can be used as an indicator of the
level of engagement.
There are several studies in cognitive psychology which have looked at the effects of the use of
different input devices on the neural processing and the elicited behaviours. For example, key presses can
be considered discrete decisions and while they have been widely used in PC-based experiments before
(9), many studies have shown a continuous flow of information between the brain systems involved in
motor processes as opposed to previous assumptions about sequential stages in motor outputs (10-11).
These findings suggest that devices which allow for continuous rather than discrete input in terms of
motor decisions better mimic the neural processing of such decisions. Moreover, a study by Rupp et al.
(12) demonstrated that the use of a joystick, as opposed to a keyboard, resulted in lower mental workload
in a difficult task, which could suggest that keyboards are unsuitable input devices in complex control
tasks. Finally, a study by Chung et al. (13) investigated online shopping experience and purchase patterns
using both mouse-controlled and touch interface settings. They found that shoppers who used a touch
interface to browse products (vs. mouse) have a significantly higher engagement with their shopping
experience. The studies mentioned above show that there are possible differences in behaviour resulting
from the type of input device adopted, making the search for and testing of alternative solutions in
dynamic experiments a research priority.
In addition to comparing cycling behaviour in VR when using different devices to elicit
preferences, we also set out to explore the latter’s impact on participants’ neural activity as a proxy
measure of engagement. For this reason, we employed electroencephalography (EEG), a scalp-recorded
measure of the electrical activity generated by the brain. Typically, in the transport literature, the use of
EEG has largely focused on the investigation of driver fatigue and drowsiness (14-17), level of
alertness/attention or cognitive performance (18). However, little has been done to evaluate the
engagement of participants in the immersive environment from a neural perspective. In particular, the use
of neuroimaging devices in applied experimental research has been heavily constrained by the signal-tonoise ratio of EEG, where artefacts in the data can stem from physiological (e.g. ocular, facial and body
muscle movements) and non-physiological sources (e.g. electric signals generated by nearby equipment,
as shown by Puce et al. (19)). Therefore, VR experiments which allow a great degree of flexibility in
participants’ head and body movements are more prone to producing artefactual data. However, recent
wireless systems such as Emotiv EPOC+ (20) and Enobio (21) are designed for dynamic experimental
setups and attempt to mitigate the impact of movement artefacts on the scalp-recorded EEG.
In this paper, we compare a particular pattern of oscillatory brain activity known as occipital
alpha ( ) to infer participant’s engagement in the task. Occipital , which is quantified through frequency
analysis of the signal ranging from 8 to14 Hz, is one of the most commonly observed signatures of brain
activity, with numerous studies demonstrating a relationship between oscillations in this frequency band
and attentional processing (22-25). As such, the signal presents an ideal candidate to investigate the
impact of presentation format on participants’ degree of task-relevant engagement.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We present our specific hypotheses in the
next section. The survey design and sample characteristics for the two experiments are discussed next,
followed by the methodological approach of the study. We next turn to the results section, followed by
the discussion that reviews the insights from the analysis.

HYPOTHESES
Five hypotheses are put forward based on the evidence from the existing literature presented
above and tested empirically using our data. They relate to cycling speed, head movements (an indicator
of engagement with the surroundings beyond peripheral vision), acceleration and braking behaviour as
well as neural processing. We now look at these five in turn.
Cycling speed
Hypothesis 1A: The average speed is higher in the keyboard-controlled experiment as opposed to
instrumented bicycle one.
Hypothesis 1B: There is more variance in speed in the instrumented bicycle experiment than in the
keyboard experiment.
It is hypothesized that the average speed will be higher in the keyboard-controlled experiment as it
requires less physical effort to accelerate compared to an instrumented bicycle. Moreover, the
acceleration is more instantaneous when using the keyboard. For the same reason, we expect that there
will be more variation in the speed observed in the instrumented bicycle experiment, as more physical
effort is needed to move through the scenarios, making it more difficult to maintain constant speed levels.
Head movement
Hypothesis 2: The average head movement is higher in the instrumented bicycle experiment than in the
keyboard experiment.
We expect that the use of the instrumented bicycle will induce participants to inspect the environment,
resulting in more head movement (26-27). This would be due to the higher level of immersion in the
environment, due to the improved design compared to the keyboard, and due to the fact that braking in
case of any hazardous circumstances on the road will take longer on the instrumented bike compared to
instantaneous reaction while pressing the arrows on the keyboard.
Acceleration & Braking
Hypothesis 3: There is more variance in the acceleration behaviour in the instrumented bicycle
experiment than in the keyboard experiment.
Hypothesis 4: There is more variance in the braking behaviour in the instrumented bicycle experiment
than in the keyboard experiment.
Hypotheses 3 and 4 stem from the fact that the use of the instrumented bicycle provides more scope to
control behaviour, as participants intertwine acceleration and deceleration more often compared to a
keyboard. Cycling on the bike requires more physical effort and time to switch between subsequent
actions or respond to changing conditions on the road, whereas acceleration and braking are more
instantaneous with the keyboard.
Neural processing
Hypothesis 5: The mean amplitude of the alpha wave is higher in keyboard-controlled experiment
compared to that of the instrumented bicycle.
Hypothesis 5 is based on the evidence from a large body of work showing the wave to be a wellestablished correlate of attentional processing with an increase in amplitude found as participants’
attention drifts away from the task (17, 28). On the other hand, current understanding in neuroscience
holds that a low wave implies increased excitability, and thus an increased response to external stimuli

(29-30). Therefore, we hypothesize that if the keyboard-controlled experiment engages participants to a
lower extent, the mean amplitude is expected to be higher as opposed to the instrumented bicycle data.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
This section describes the common experimental procedure used for the two experiments. It also
discusses the components that were different between keyboard-controlled and instrumented bike
experiment as well as the basic characteristics of the two samples.
Keyboard-controlled experimental setup
The experimental session started with the participant being seated on a chair and having an
Emotiv Epoc+ EEG headset (31) and an Oculus Rift VR (32) head mounted display (HMD) placed on
their head. The Emotiv headset uses 14 electrodes (at AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4,
F8 and AF4) sampling across the scalp. The system was selected as its compact design allowed it to be
used jointly with the VR HMD. As a first step, the baseline brain activity was recorded with the sampling
rate of 128 Hz, while participants had their eyes open and focused their gaze on one point on the screen
for 15 seconds. The same procedure was then repeated with their eyes closed. Importantly, before the
main part of the experiment started, the participants had an opportunity to familiarise themselves with the
equipment in a trial run.

Figure 1: The immersive scenarios used in the experiment.

The experiment used 6 scenarios with an immersive presentation of traffic from the perspective of the
cyclist. All the scenarios had a number of common elements. Firstly, the cyclist was riding on the
pavement. Secondly, in each scenario, there were four locations where a potential collision with other
road users could occur, namely, two junctions and two points along the cycling lane where pedestrians
could cross to reach the bin on the right side of the bike lane, as seen in Figure 1. Thirdly, all the
scenarios featured pedestrians as well as cars and the percentage of pedestrians and cars which would
cross the bike lane or turn at the junction was constant. At the same time, there were also random
components in each scenario which stemmed from the fact that in each scenario, the specific movements
of crossing pedestrians and turning cars were presented randomly, while keeping their overall percentage
the same across all the scenarios. This resulted in differences between scenarios in terms of the actual
number of pedestrians or cars at the “collision locations” when the cyclist was passing by these points.
This was clearly also influenced by the speed of the cyclist, and hence the point in time at which the
“collision locations” were reached. Altogether, these elements gave basis for the complex traffic scenarios
which participants were required to navigate. The scenarios encompassed a 360-degree view of the road
which surrounded the participant and responded to their head movements. Importantly, based on the
feedback received during initial pre-testing of the set-up, sound was also included to capture both visual
and auditory cues that are available to cyclists in real-life settings. The volume of vehicles was consistent

with their distance to the cyclist so that the sound of an approaching car increased as it got closer to the
cyclist.
The experiment comprised the same 6 scenarios. The repetition was used because we also
collected neural data which requires a higher number of trials in order to obtain more stability in the EEG
signal. The task for the participant was to cycle through the scenario at the desired pace until the finish
line at the end of each scenario. In order to navigate through the scenario, participants used the keyboard
to adjust their speed but had no ability to turn left or right. They pressed the up arrow to accelerate and the
down arrow to brake. The keyboard was placed on the table in front of them, and before the experiment
began, they were guided by the experimenter to find the appropriate keys on the keyboard. The
experimental setup of a keyboard-controlled experiment can be seen on right-hand side of Figure 2.
The visual stimuli in the experiment come from VR road simulations developed by Future Cities
Laboratory (33) using Unity 3D Game Engine (34). These stimuli involve pre-programmed environments
where the cars and pedestrian movements do not respond to the actions of the cyclist. That is to say, other
road users do not accelerate or decelerate in reaction to the chosen action of the cyclist (participant),
therefore collisions between the cyclist and cars/pedestrians were possible. Collisions were detected if a
cyclist overlapped visually with any other agent. Even though participants were specifically instructed to
avoid any collisions, there were 19 instances (3.2% of all scenarios by all participants) of collisions with
other road users. When this happened, the experiment was interrupted, and the participant was asked to
start again from the beginning of that scenario.
The initial number of recruited participants was 50, from which 4 participants were removed due
to failure to complete the whole experiment, leading to a final sample size of 46 participants (18 males, 28
females), comprising staff and students of the University of Leeds as well as members of the general
public. The mean age of the participants was 30.7 years, with a standard deviation of 10.88 years.
Instrumented bike experimental setup
The experimental design for the instrumented bicycle data collection was similar to the keyboard
counterpart in terms of the audio and visual stimuli used and number and types of cycling scenarios. The
experimental session commenced by familiarizing the participant with the instrumented bicycle, including
demonstrating how to use a hand brake (all the participants could ride a bike in reality). Subsequently, the
participant mounted the bike and the HTC Vive head mounted display (HMD) (35) and Enobio (36)
devices were placed on their head. The Enobio headset uses 8 electrodes (at FP1, FP2, Fz, C3, Cz, C4, P3
and P4) sampling across the scalp. The system allowed joint use with HTC Vive HMD. As a first step, the
baseline brain activity was recorded with the sampling rate of 128 Hz, while participants had their eyes
open and focused their gaze on one point on the screen for 1 minute. The same procedure was then
repeated with eyes closed. Before the main part of the experiment started, participants could familiarise
themselves with the use of the bicycle and the environment in a trial session.
The experiment consisted of 6 immersive presentations of traffic scenarios from the perspective
of the cyclists, shown in random order. The visual stimuli proceeded from the same source as before.
Similarly, the participant was asked to cycle through the scenario at the desired pace until the finish line
at the end of each scenario. In order to navigate through the scenario, the participant used the pedals of
the bicycle and had no ability to turn left or right. To brake, the participant used a hand brake positioned
on the right side of the handlebar. The instrumented bike can be observed on the left-hand side of Figure
2. The instrumented bike belongs to Future Cities Laboratories in Singapore.

The scenarios used in these experiments allowed for recording of cycling behaviour with respect
to changing traffic environment. The specific variables of interest, which are described in detail in the
next section, included the cycling speed, braking activity, acceleration, horizontal head movements as
well as the EEG signal. We put forward several hypotheses based on these variables, as specified in the
section above.
Fifty participants were recruited for the experiment, however 2 of them were removed due to
failure to complete the whole experiment, leading to a final sample size of 48 participants (29 males, 19
females), comprising staff and students of the National University of Singapore as well as the members of
the general public. The mean age of the participants was 26.5 years, with 6.7 years standard deviation.
It is important to emphasize that the small sample size in both experiments is a typical issue faced
by researchers working with VR and/or driving simulator data (37- 38, 3) as the experiment duration is
much longer and the associated cost much higher compared to typical stated preference (SP) studies.

METHODS
In this section, we present the methodology used to test our hypotheses. We conducted a
between-subject comparison of the behaviour in two samples, where one sample used a keyboard and the
other used the instrumented bike to cycle through the scenarios. As a result of this experimental design,
none of the participants took part in both treatments. To compare the behaviour, we analysed the
following variables: acceleration, braking, speed and head movement. We also looked at the difference in
mean amplitude in the two experiments. The sampling rate for all variables except EEG was 4 Hz.
To test the proposed hypotheses, we conduct a Welch’s t-test (39) on the mean values of Speed,
sideways movements of the head (Head Yaw) as well as -wave amplitude. This test was chosen due to
the slightly unequal sample sizes, where keyboard sample contains 46 participants and the instrumented
bicycle sample includes 48 participants. Furthermore, the F-test (40) was used to make inferences about
the variances in Speed, Acceleration and Braking between two experiments. The individual variables
produced during the experiments were the following:
Acceleration
The acceleration variable (a) is the rate of velocity gain and is measured in metre per squared second
(m/s2). The formula used to calculate acceleration can be seen in Equation 1:

Braking
In the instrumented bicycle experiment, braking is measured as the degree of deviation of the braking pad
from its default position. It ranges from 0 to 15o. In the keyboard setting, the braking variable recorded
the degree to which the down-arrow key was pressed, and the values range from 0 to 1. In order to be able
to compare these values, we performed a min-max normalization on the values of Braking for the
instrumented bicycle.
Speed
The speed is expressed in kilometres per hour (km/h). In the keyboard-controlled experiment, the
maximum speed was capped at 25 km/h. This level was chosen based on the previous literature which
showed that the average speed of cycling in the real world is between 13.5-16 km/h with standard
deviation ranging from 3.2 - 8.4 km/h (41-43). Differently, in the instrumented bicycle experiment, there
was no limit on the maximum speed. The restriction on the keyboard-controlled experiment was imposed
in order to avoid unreasonable speeds, which could have been easily achieved with the constant pressing
of the key, and to minimize the risk of motion sickness.

Head movement
The head movement is based on head yaw - the sideways movement of the head. It is measured in degrees
from the default position (looking straight ahead), and can range from -180o to +180o, where turning the
head (as well as the torso) to the left produces negative values while a movement to the right results in
positive scores.
EEG
For the EEG analyses, we examined differences in mean amplitude in keyboard-controlled and
instrumented bicycle experiments. As the EEG signal collected through the scalp are inherently noisy, we
undertook a number of steps to eliminate artefacts and improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Specifically, we
first applied a 1-20 Hz bandpass filtering (BPF), a linear transformation that retains the components of the
data within this specific band of frequencies (44) and removes frequencies outside of this range that may
stem from physiological sources such as galvanic skin responses or external environmental sources such
as electronic equipment (45). Next, we cleaned the data to remove noise stemming from eyeblinks
(movement artefacts were corrected using a multiple source analysis method (46-47)). Finally, we
computed the power spectrum of the EEG data using Welch’s method (48) which estimates the power
spectra based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) (49). Because of our interest in occipital , we
performed a region-of-interest analysis and took an average of the activity from electrodes O1, O2, P7,
P8, T7 and T8 in the keyboard-experiment and electrodes P7, P8, C3, C4 in the instrumented bicycle to
increase the stability of the signal (50).

RESULTS
In this section, we present visual profiles of Speed and Braking for the two experiments and an
overview of the descriptive statistics in Table 1. The table highlights clear differences between the mean

using t-test and F-test, and the results are reported for each variable.

In Figure 3, we plot the profiles of the variables Speed and Braking for two randomly chosen participants
cycling in similar immersive scenarios but in the two different experimental settings. The graphs highlight
that both experiments captured participants’ behaviour correctly, as higher values of Braking are
associated with lower Speed. At the same time, it is clear that the employment of the instrumented bike
resulted in a considerably higher amount of variation in Speed and Braking compared to the keyboard
experiment, where the profiles are smoother and less dynamic.

Speed
The one-sided Welch’s t-test performed on the mean values of Speed at the individual level showed that
the mean Speed is significantly higher in the keyboard-controlled experiment (t = -16.163, df = 70.134, pvalue ~ 0). This result is in line with our Hypothesis 1A, where we expected that the lack of physical
effort and consequently relative easiness in developing higher speed would result in higher average speed
in the keyboard-controlled experiment. Moreover, when we compared the variances in mean Speed, we
found that the variance in the instrumented bicycle experiment was significantly higher compared to the
keyboard-controlled counterpart (F (47,45) = 3.9252, p-value = 0.000004777). Again, this result
conforms to our Hypothesis 1B. We show that the use of the bicycle induces people to adjust their speed
more often. It is also interesting to look at the density histogram of Speed in these two experiments
(Figure 4). We can see the near bell-shaped distribution of Speed in the experiment using the bicycle,
where the values are centred around the mean and there is more variation observed in contrast with the
keyboard-controlled experiments. A peak near zero can be observed in the instrumented-bicycle setting:
this relates to small movements when participants slowed down to stop (while waiting to cross the street
or give priority to pedestrians who crossed their bike lane). In contrast, in the keyboard experiment, we
observe a skewed distribution of Speed where the majority of observations correspond with the maximum
possible level, equal to 25 km/h. This suggests that the removal of physical effort and the use of a
keyboard contributes to the choice of maximum speed regardless of the scenario conditions.

Head movement
Head movement is an indication that the participant is making an effort to gather information beyond the
peripheral vision. The one-sided Welch’s t-test of Head Yaw demonstrated that the average head
movement is significantly higher in the instrumented bicycle experiment as opposed to the keyboardcontrolled setting (t = 2.3944, df = 89.987, p-value = 0.009362). This is in line with our Hypothesis 2,
where we expected more head movement to the sides in the instrumented bicycle experiment due to more
complex mechanism of control over the bicycle compared to keyboard, which in turn required
participants to explore the environment to a larger extent in order to be able to react more quickly. The
density histogram of the Head Yaw values (Figure 5) shows this trend, as it includes a wider range of
values for instrumented bicycle compared to the keyboard experiment. It suggests that the use of the
instrumented bicycle induces participants to inspect the environment more than a keyboard due to the
higher level of immersion in the environment and due to the fact that braking in case of any hazardous
circumstances on the road will take longer on the instrumented bike compared to instantaneous reaction
while pressing the arrow on the keyboard.

Acceleration
The results of the one-sided F-test showed that the variance of Acceleration is significantly larger in the
instrumented-bike experiment (F (47,45) = 3.1474, p-value = 0.00008789). This is in line with our
Hypothesis 3: we expected higher variation in acceleration due to the presence of physical effort and
higher difficulty in maintaining constant speed. The density histogram for Acceleration presented in
Figure 6 reflects the results of the test, as we observe that the Acceleration values are accumulated near
the mean with little variation in the keyboard-controlled experiment and have a near bell-shape
distribution in the other experiment.

Hypothesis 4 that more variance is present in the instrumented-bicycle experiment. Again, the density
histogram of Braking in Figure 7 visually reflects the results of the test, as there is more variation in an
experiment that used an instrumented bicycle.

DISCUSSION
VR experiments can effectively contribute to transport research only if the behaviour elicited in a
virtual environment closely resembles real-world behaviour. Hence, it is important to be able to
discriminate between different experimental designs that employ immersive technologies. The objective
of the present paper was to compare the cycling behaviour elicited in two separate experiments which
used the same visual stimuli but different devices to control the navigation through the simulated
scenarios. The first one employed a keyboard and the second one an instrumented bicycle. In order to
draw conclusions about the behaviour, we analysed participants’ speed, acceleration, braking and head
movements, along with data about their neural activity. The results are summarized in Table 2, where we
also show examples from the existing literature which reached similar results in different experimental
contexts. This highlights not only that our findings are in line with the literature, but that we confirm
these results for the context of cycling and for the joint use of immersive technology and EEG.

Amplitude of wave
The one-sided Welch’s t-test demonstrated that the mean amplitude is lower in the instrumented bicycle
experiment as opposed to the keyboard-controlled at the 90% confidence level (t = 1.35, df = 40.79, pvalue = 0.09), which is in line with our Hypothesis 5, where we expected a lower amplitude in
instrumented bicycle experiment due to the more immersive setting and higher cognitive engagement
compared to the keyboard.

Overall, the results show significant differences in behaviour. A more active and varied behaviour
is observed in the instrumented bicycle experiment as compared to the keyboard-controlled study. For
instance, the average speed is lower and more heterogeneous in the instrumented bicycle experiment,
suggesting that participants dedicate more time to explore the environment. Moreover, the average speed
in the instrumented bicycle experiment of 14.32 km/h is closer to the average speed of cycling in reality,
which ranges between 13.5-16 km/h, in contrast to the keyboard counterpart where average speed was
considerably higher in spite of the cap of 25km/h. It suggests that the use of the instrumented bicycle
instead of the keyboard allows for better approximation of the real cycling kinematics.
More variation in acceleration and braking, as well as more head movement is also observed in
the instrumented bicycle setting, implying a higher degree of engagement with the environment. This is
further confirmed by the analysis of the EEG data, where a lower amplitude of the wave in the
instrumented bicycle experiment suggests higher mental engagement in the task compared to the
keyboard-controlled one.
Our work provides evidence that the instrumented bicycle is more effective than the keyboard
controls in eliciting behavioural patterns demonstrated by previous naturalistic studies of cycling
behaviour. We use these studies as a benchmark due to the lack of evidence in the previous literature with
regard to typical, real-life cycling behaviour in absolute terms. Moreover, our results are consistent with
previous studies conducted in other contexts that investigated the effects of the use of various input
devices on behaviour, as presented in the introduction and in Table 2. The use of a keyboard, or in fact
any other input device such as a joystick or touchpad, makes the cycling experience clearly less realistic
as the user does not need to exert physical effort, a crucial component associated with cycling. It then
follows that changes in action could be seen as less consequential as they do not impact on physical
fatigue. This relates both to the actual action (e.g. accelerate) as well as the degree thereof. On the other
hand, the advantages of the use of a keyboard or other simple devices cannot be ignored. Their use as an
input device is cheaper and less time consuming than the employment of the stationary bicycle. They are
also more portable which makes it easier to collect data in different locations. Moreover, if VR is used
jointly with neuroimaging devices, then a simpler input device offers a more static approach, reducing the
extent of potential noise in the neural data stemming from body movements. The choice of the input
device for VR experiments is thus not an arbitrary decision and should be aligned with the objectives of
the study to not constrain the spectrum of behaviour which can be captured and minimise the potential

biases resulting from the mere choice of the controller. The decision of an appropriate input tool also has
to be weighed against technical capabilities such the budget, duration of the experiment and comfort of
the participants as well as a possibility of joint use with other equipment employed in the study. In this
paper, we compare only two devices. However, it is important to take into consideration other available
appliances such as a 3D mouse, joystick, steering wheel, gamepad or hybrid controller which may offer
different benefits depending on the design of the study.
The results thus emphasize the importance of the experimental setup in a VR experiment beyond the
choice of appropriate visual stimulus. The findings extend understanding of the effects of the use of
distinct input devices within the VR domain by demonstrating that the use of an instrumented bicycle
increases the realism of the cycling simulations by influencing the manoeuvring decisions. These results
were further reinforced by the analysis of neural data. Further research needs to be conducted to
generalize these findings. In particular, we recommend testing different cycling scenarios as well as
experiments focusing on different aspects of travel behaviour to compare participants’ actions in the
experimental setting with real-world decisions. The findings shed light on the level of behavioural
congruence of the state-of-the-art VR studies which will be valuable in the interpretation and the level of
confidence in the results of different VR studies. It is also expected to be a valuable resource to
researchers and practitioners planning to administer VR-based data collection and help them to better
design the experimental setup as there has been a significant interest in using VR for modelling cycling
behaviour (54-55). By comparing and contrasting the behaviour of cyclists in the two VR environments,
the paper is expected to provide guidance to researchers investigating cycling behaviour in dynamic
setting and hence improve the modelling of speed and acceleration of cyclists which can feed into safety
research or capacity analyses for instance. The findings are also expected to be useful for planners who
are interested in deploying VR to more realistically test the impact of different urban designs on the
propensity to cycle, indicating, for example, the road and pavements features which contribute to the
higher perception of safety among cyclists. The research findings can hence help transport and urban
planners in making more informed choices regarding urban infrastructure. Finally, VR tools are
increasingly being used in designing vehicles of the future – the interaction between connected and
automated vehicles (CAVs) and other road users. The findings can help researchers modelling the
interaction between cyclists and CAVs in designing their experiments and better interpreting the results
by giving an idea about the comparative realism of the collected data.
