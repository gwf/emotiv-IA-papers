Objectives: To compare quantitative EEG signal and test-retest reliability of medical
grade and consumer EEG systems.
Methods: Resting state EEG was acquired by two medical grade (B-Alert, Enobio) and
two consumer (Muse, Mindwave) EEG systems in five healthy subjects during two study
visits. EEG patterns, power spectral densities (PSDs) and test/retest reliability in eyes
closed and eyes open conditions were compared across the four systems, focusing
on Fp1, the only common electrode. Fp1 PSDs were obtained using Welch’s modified
periodogram method and averaged for the five subjects for each visit. The test/retest
results were calculated as a ratio of Visit 1/Visit 2 Fp1 channel PSD at each 1 s epoch.
Results: B-Alert, Enobio, and Mindwave Fp1 power spectra were similar. Muse
showed a broadband increase in power spectra and the highest relative variation across
test-retest acquisitions. Consumer systems were more prone to artifact due to eye blinks
and muscle movement in the frontal region.

INTRODUCTION
Neurodegenerative disorders represent huge global unmet medical needs and require the
development of new disease modifying therapies. Given the insidious nature of these disorders
and the high cost of many diagnostic tests, there is a significant need for widely available,
reliable, and inexpensive biomarkers to track progression of neurodegenerative processes in time
frames suitable for drug development. In this context, EEG may have remarkable potential.
Although EEG is susceptible to known lifestyle factors and medications, it has many considerable
advantages. EEG reflects synaptic activity, which is a common denominator for the functional
impact of neurodegenerative processes. EEG is a non-invasive, portable, safe, and inexpensive
technology that is widely accepted and requires relatively short acquisition time. Qualitative EEG
is routinely utilized in clinical practice for the diagnosis of epilepsy. More recently, an integration

MATERIALS AND METHODS

of a quantitative EEG biomarker (qEEG) and clinician’s
evaluation have been proposed for the assessment of attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and has been granted
from the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) class II
designation to support the clinical evaluation of ADHD
(Lenartowicz and Loo, 2014; Snyder et al., 2015). qEEG is in
investigational stages for use as an endpoint in neurodegenerative
diseases in clinical trials. However, recent advances in data
analyses, interpretation and improved spatial resolution have
increased the potential of EEG as a reliable, accurate biomarker
for neurodegenerative disease progression. Many reported
observational resting state qEEG analyses support its potential
value as a biomarker for detection of neural signatures of
neurodegeneration occurring in Alzheimer’s disease (Babiloni
et al., 2011; Moretti et al., 2011; Berka et al., 2014; Chen et al.,
2015; Garn et al., 2015; Ruffini et al., 2016; Waninger et al., 2016),
Parkinson’s disease (Sarnthein and Jeanmonod, 2007; Babiloni
et al., 2011; Soria-Frisch et al., 2014; Shani Waninger et al., 2015;
Kroupi et al., 2017) and frontotemporal dementia (Pijnenburg
et al., 2008; Nishida et al., 2011; Caso et al., 2012; Goossens et al.,
2016).
Over the years, EEG hardware technology has also evolved
and several wireless multi-channel systems have emerged that
deliver high quality EEG and physiological signals in a simpler,
more convenient and comfortable design than the traditional,
cumbersome systems. Traditional EEG systems require lengthy
assembly and application time, typically involving abrasion of the
patient’s scalp. The application time and discomfort render these
traditional systems challenging to use in populations affected by
dementia, where cooperation with lengthy clinical procedures
is often difficult. However, several currently available wireless
systems can be applied in 20 min or less with no discomfort
during application and with a comfortable fit during acquisitions.
Combined with advances in signal detection and quantitative
analysis techniques, wireless systems are ideal candidates for
relatively rapid, tolerable clinical assessment of potentially
challenging dementia populations, such as behavioral variant
frontotemporal dementia, characterized by prominent behavioral
and personality changes.
More recently, there has also been a growing market for
consumer wearable technologies leading to limited-channel
systems available for personal use, such as meditation and
relaxation training. It is conceivable that these systems, albeit
their limited coverage, may also be used in selected clinical
studies. Application of these consumer systems in clinical
trials research has not been extensively explored however and
the accuracy and reliability of these systems for repeated
measurements have not been well-established. Further, it is
not clear whether the limited-channel acquisition may provide
sufficient data and anatomical coverage to assess the neural
signatures in patients affected by neurodegenerative diseases.
The current study was designed to provide initial evaluation
of the potential of consumer EEG systems for clinical trials, by
comparing the ease of use, accuracy and reliability of two medical
grade, multi-channel wireless EEG systems, B-Alert X24, and
Enobio 20, with two consumer, limited-channel systems, Muse
and Mindwave.

Participants
The study population included five healthy participants who met
eligibility for the study (Table 1). Subjects were excluded if, after
review of their medical history, concomitant medications, and
lifestyle (alcohol and caffeine consumption as well as smoking
status), they were not considered healthy. Specifically, they were
excluded from the study if they had a history of epilepsy, or
other sleep, neurological or psychiatric disorders or were taking
medications or had a lifestyle known to affect EEG signal such as
smoking and considerable alcohol and caffeine consumption.
Written informed consent was obtained from all the
study participants following the guidelines for experimental
investigation with human subjects required by the Chesapeake
Institutional Review Board.

Study Procedures, EEG Data Acquisition,
and Analysis
To avoid potential EEG signal variability associated with
nutritional intake and circadian variations, all visits occurred
in the morning following a standard low carbohydrate, high
protein breakfast (to minimize post-prandial drowsiness) at the
Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) research labs study site. In
addition, participants were asked to avoid alcoholic beverages the
night before the study visit as well as to fast and avoid caffeine on
the morning of the visit.
EEG data was acquired during two separate visits ∼1
week apart from two multi-channel (20 channels) medical
EEG systems, B-Alert (Advanced Brain Monitoring, ABM) and
Enobio (Neuroelectrics) (Figure 1, Table 2) and two limitedchannel consumer systems, Muse (Interaxon, 2 channels) and
Mindwave (Neurosky, one channel) (Figure 1, Table 2) in the
following order: Muse, Mindwave, B-Alert, Enobio. The B-Alert
X24 EEG System and Enobio are both CE medically certified 20
channel wireless systems applied in the standard international
10–20 montage and acquire EEG signal at a sampling rate of 256
Hz. In addition, B-Alert has been cleared by the FDA for use as a
medical device.
B-Alert uses mastoids as a reference channel. Enobio can
be used with a mastoid reference, ear-clip or using other scalp
locations. Mindwave also has a reference on the ear slip and Muse
has three reference channels on the forehead. All the systems
included signal quality check, however as opposed to the medical
EEG systems, both consumer systems have dry electrodes and no
impedance check.
These technologies were selected based on their ability to
provide end-users with raw EEG outputs through practical and
non-cost-prohibitive access.
Ten minutes of resting state EEG was acquired during eyes
open (EO) with visual fixation on a cross symbol presented on a
computer screen (5 min) as well as while eyes closed (EC) for 5
min.
Since all four systems only share the FP1 channel (Figure 1),
EEG patterns (raw and decontaminated), power spectral densities
(PSDs), and test/retest reliability comparisons across the four

Resting State EEG
EEG data was successfully collected from all four systems tested.
As expected, due to the dry electrodes and the limited number of
channels, the set up time was considerably less for the consumer
EEG systems. However, there was no observed difference in
subjects’ tolerance and acceptance across the four systems.
Patterns of raw EEG data in EO (Figure 2) and EC (Figure 3)
conditions were collected and evaluated from each system. Muse
and Mindwave were more prone to artifact due to eye blinks
and muscle movement in the frontal region with eye opening
(Figure 2).

EEG systems. Representation of the shared and unique channels among the
four EEG systems evaluated. The common channel to all the four EEG
systems, Fp1 (blue); channels unique to the Muse system (red); channels
shared between the multi-channel systems, B-Alert and Enobio (green).

Average PSDs in the Fp1 channel common to all the four
EEG systems for Visit 1 and Visit 2 were calculated and were
plotted for both EO (Figures 4A,B) and EC (Figures 4C,D)
conditions. In the EO condition, B-alert and Enobio spectra were
approximately equal, while Mindwave was slightly increased but
followed a similar curve. A broadband increase in power was
observed for PSDs acquired with the Muse system. Similarly,
in the EC condition (Figures 4C,D), B-Alert, Enobio, and
Mindwave PSDs were similar however increased broadband
power was observed for Muse spectra, which also appeared to
have higher variation than the other systems. Peaks at 8–12 Hz
(alpha band) were visible in the spectra acquired with the B-Alert,
Enobio, and Mindwave systems at each visit. While there was a
clear alpha peak for the Muse power spectra on Visit 2, no peak
was observed in the Visit 1 spectra.

EEG systems evaluated in the study were performed focusing on
the Fp1 electrode in both EO and EC conditions.
The EEG data from each system were loaded into MATLAB
(Mathworks) using custom built functions. The EEG data
recorded during breaks and instructions were discarded prior to
analysis. Power spectral density of EEG for each 1 s epoch was
calculated using Welch’s modified periodogram method with a
Hamming window tapering of 1 s length. PSDs were calculated
on resting EEG during both eyes open and eyes closed periods.
To allow equal units (µV), a correction factor of 1.25 (Muse), 0.25
(MindWave), or 1,000 (Enobio 20) was applied. All Fp1 channel
PSD data were averaged for the five subjects for each visit. Testretest was performed by calculating and plotting Vist1/Visit2.

Fp1 Channel Resting EEG Test/Retest
Comparison
In the EC condition, the power spectral ratio was between 0.975
and 1.025 for B-Alert, Enobio, and Mindwave (Figure 5A). The
Muse system PSD ratios had more variation then the other
three systems with ratios between 1.125 and 1.225. In the EO
condition, there appeared to be slightly more variation for Enobio
in the slow waves Delta (1–3 Hz), Theta (3–7 Hz), and slow
alpha (8–10) and for B-Alert and Mindwave in the faster waves
Beta (13–30 Hz) and Gamma (25–40 Hz). However, ratios were

to evaluate their potential application in clinical research and
clinical trials. Newly popularized consumer EEG systems were
evaluated due to their low cost, wide accessibility, and potential
for home based studies in challenging populations. Among the
popular applications of consumer EEG systems are meditation
and relaxation training as well as coping with anxiety or pain.
Recent investigations have been exploring their utility beyond

(Bialas and Milanowski, 2014; Kim et al., 2015; Taherian et al.,
2017). The application of simpler EEG systems (6-channels, for
example) is also being explored for emergency settings (Jakab
et al., 2014). A prior evaluation, although utilizing a more
complex headset, showed that commercially available multi-lead

consumer EEG systems, such as the Emotiv EPOC 16-electrode
cap, may also have value in evaluating clinical conditions (Schiff
et al., 2016).
This study provided evidence that fairly good quality EEG data
can be successfully collected from consumer EEGs. However,
there were distinctions in the power increase, test retest, and

differentiation in performance and, particularly, specific
limitations of use that could hinder the applications of consumer
systems in research and clinical trials settings. On the other hand,
the medical multi-lead systems are less ideal for entertainment
purposes that require rapid setup and data processing from
a minimal number of electrodes. The main limitation of this
study relies in the small size of the study population and lack of
randomization of order of systems used for acquisition. Data was
acquired in the same order of systems in order to avoid effects
of time of acquisition that can impact EEG due to circadian
rhythms. However, EEG power metrics have proven to be a very
reliable and repeatable for individuals when using standard EEG
systems. For this reason, the selected sample size was considered
informative.
In conclusion, EEG data can be successfully collected from
all four systems tested, including consumer EEG systems, with
varying limitations on usability, data quality and reliability
that guide their optimal applications including in clinical
trial settings. Susceptibility to artifact and variability in
test/retest reliability associated with current consumer EEG
systems suggest the use of medical grade EEG system for
robust clinical cross-sectional and longitudinal EEG data
collections.

shape of the alpha peak observed at 8–13 Hz. Mindwave showed
overall similar Fp1 power spectra to the medical systems with a
slight broadband increase over B-Alert and Enobio. Muse showed
a broadband increase in power spectra, which may reflect artifact
in the data acquired by a dry electrode.
Consumer EEG systems did show a significantly more
convenient and faster set up,which is optimal for their intended
use in entertainment and self-help applications. However,
their data quality was overall negatively affected by artifact
susceptibility associated with the dry electrode. As expected,
the data quality was particularly diminished during EO. The
lack of impedance testing capability and application to the
frontal region, which is particularly prone to eye blinks and
muscle movement with eye opening also likely contributed to
this relative artifact. Additionally, the assessment performed by
consumer EEG systems is, by their nature, limited and confined
to the only anatomical brain region covered by the few channels,
precluding multi-networks evaluations.
Dry electrodes may also be more prone to result in discomfort
over time and pose a higher risk of misplacement on the forehead,
leading to inaccurate signal acquisition and test/retest. Compared
to medical grade equipment, test/retest reliability was lower
in consumer EEG systems. Reliability was measured with a
test-retest acquisition for all systems (Figure 5). While B-Alert,
Enobio, and Mindwave performed reasonably well, Muse had
relatively low reliability. Further, while a clear alpha peak was
demonstrated for Muse on Visit 2 (Figure 4), the absence of an
alpha peak on Visit 1 suggests a lack of consistency that may
be due to artifact. Consistent reliable measures of brain activity
are crucial in clinical trials when monitoring disease progression
and evaluating efficacy of an experimental therapeutic. While
the consumer systems may be useful for a quick assessment
when time is limited, these limitations of consumer EEG could
hinder their applications in research and clinical trials settings
and a medical grade system with high test-retest reliability is
recommended for use as a pharmacodynamic endpoint in clinical
assessments.
Ultimately, the comparison of medical and consumer
EEG systems under experimental conditions highlighted
