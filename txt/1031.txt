Abstract: The positive effects of interest on different aspects, e.g., learning and education, economy,
psychological well-being, and social relations, have been widely addressed by many psychological
and physiological studies in the last two decades. While the psychological work has investigated
this impact of interest theoretically, the physiological studies have focused more on the modulatory
effects. However, some studies have addressed both sides of the effects. In this work, we conduct
a comprehensive review of physiological studies on interest detection, from different perspectives
carried out between 2003 and 2019. A lack of connection between the psychological and physiological
studies was identified. Therefore, this paper aims to integrate the unique psychological and physiological aspects and characteristics of interest to form a base for future research by considering the pros
and cons of the included studies. For example, considering the two types of interest (situational and
individual) the detected interest in learning, gaming, and advertisement’s physiological experiments
could be referring specifically to situational interest. Hence, bridging the gap between both physiological and psychological studies is essential for improving the research on interest. Furthermore, we
propose several suggestions for future work direction.

1. Introduction
Many theories, definitions, hypotheses, and experiments regarding interest were
proposed in the late 19th century. Each had its own perspective, addressed one or more
aspects of interest, and was based partially on previous research and findings and/or new
experimental work. This work led to the proposal of a variety of definitions, and thus
concepts, regarding interest. It is therefore difficult to combine the conclusions of this
research in one concept because of the uncontrolled settings of the experimental studies,
or often, missing connections between the different fields of study. What could be so
interesting about interest that grasped researchers’ attention and led to efforts to study and
explore this area of research? According to a large number of researchers, e.g., Krapp [1],
Rotgans and Schmidt [2], and Harackiewicz and Hulleman [3], interest is highly related
and linked to academic achievement. Many researchers have proposed the idea of interest
as a motivational variable and an important and basic element of productive learning.
These researchers include Silvia [4], U. Schiefele [5], and Hidi [6]. It has been suggested
that interesting information is significantly better remembered and more easily understood
than non-interesting information. Renninger and Wozniak [7] have studied the effects of
interest on recognition and recall in young children. Interest is also an emotion that is often
studied in the context of television commercials and consumers’ responses. It is advised to
utilize technology to trigger consumer interest toward specific products in order to increase

sales and enhance brand image [8,9]. There are other implicit rewards for “interest” that
benefit individuals personally by raising their self-efficacy. In addition, interest not only
has cognitive effects but also physiological effects.
This paper reviews researches of different objectives that employed different methods
in order to provide interested researchers with direction for future studies. The motivation for writing this review was to help researchers recognize the astonishing benefits of
triggering, detecting, and maintaining interest in individuals in different aspects of life,
including well-being, education, society, and economy. This review also discusses the
strengths and weaknesses of some current research on interest from an objective point
of view. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes our review method and
research questions, along with the nature and level of interests. Section 3 highlights the
physiological patterns and features of Interest. These patterns include EEG, ECG, Eye
tracking and other patterns. The correlation between self-report and physiological sensors
is also discussed. Section 4 illustrates the effect of experimental design on the output of the
experiment. This includes task, stimulation, number of subjects, and their age. The paper
concludes with some recommendations for future studies on the detection of interest using
physiological methods.
2. Methodological Choices and Research Questions
Here, we review all the related peer-reviewed articles that address interest or its levels
using physiological sensors. Specifically, we reviewed recent work written in English from
the past last 13 years, comprising articles written from 2003 until 2019. We intend to include
the earliest studies with high impact on the current research and to precisely discuss and
analyze recently published innovative findings and insights.
A quick review of the literature indicated that many studies address interest subjectively, but very few studies with objective support. Many psychological, educational,
and social studies lack support from neuroscientific research that examin the way interest
modulates physiological parameters. Encouraging researchers to carry out physiological
studies would lead to the publication of research that would not only support, but also explain and clarify ambiguities regarding interest, such as interest as a cognitive construct or
emotional state, and the development of interest over time. These studies would also lead
to a better understanding of the two common types of interest (personal and situational)
and would assist future researchers in discovering solutions to reinforce the presence of
either or both of these two types of interest. This would, in turn, improve student learning,
well-being, and goal accomplishment.
Hence, this review focuses on presenting research work that examines the physiological effects of interest using the following physiological parameters: electroencephalogram
(EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate (HR), galvanic skin response (GSR), eye movements, and pressure seat. We aim to answer the following research questions in this
review:
RQ1: What basic definitions of interest do the authors refer to?
RQ2: What is interesting about the different levels and types of “interest”?
RQ3: What are the physiological sensors that have been used so far to assess interest and
what are their associated patents?
RQ4: What are the possible effects of differences in experiment design, including differences
in stimulation, number of subjects, age of subjects, and length of experiment, on the
experiment output?
RQ5: How can we improve research related to the detection of interest using physiological
sensors?
The terms used in our search included” situational interest detection”, “detection of interest using EEG”, “individual interest detection”, “detection of interest using eye tracker”,
“detection of interest using ECG and HR”, “interest in academic content”, “customer

hances learning (for a summary, see [5,15,16]). Dewey [17] described interest in an object
or a topic as “being engaged, engrossed, or entirely taken up”. Furthermore, interest has
been discussed by many researchers in connection with individual states, e.g., emotions
by Izard [18], attention by J. A. Deutsch and D. Deutsch [19], curiosity by Kashdan and

Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 1318

Silvia [20], flow by M. Csikszentmihalyi [21], and “a thinking state, rather than an emotion”
by Ekman [22]. Although there is a valid justification for each consideration, studying
interest as related to only one of these phenomena narrows its meaning. Hockenbury
and Hockenbury [23] have stated that emotions consist of three different components:
physiological response, behavioral expressive response, and subjective experience. Interest
appears to have these components: it encompasses a subjective experience as described by
Izard [24], physiological and behavioral expressive responses associated with increased
cognition, activation, and concentration, and approach-oriented action [4,18,25]. These
arguments support the idea that interest has both affective and cognitive components.
Hidi [6] has suggested that interest involves affect when it is initially triggered, which
makes it appropriate to consider interest as an emotion at this stage. Interest is then
integrated into one’s cognition as it develops [13,26].
Krapp [27] studied interest as an independent variable such as certain aspects of
learning outcomes, dependent variables such as academic achievement, or hypothetical
mediators such as attention and emotional experience. He also discussed the relationships
between situational and individual interest, which are widely accepted as different types
of interest (for a review, see [3]), and learning outcomes. This will be discussed thoroughly
in the next section.
This brief review highlights the variety of publications establishing or studying the
numerous meanings of interest. Nevertheless, the studies outlined here generally agree
that “interest” is a multidimensional construct, i.e., it has both emotional and cognitive
components [28]. Establishing that interest has both emotional and cognitive components
is necessary to assess the feasibility of different methods and sensors used to measure
interest in the physiological studies that will be discussed in the following sections.
Here we will briefly review studies discussing interest as a physiological construct
to explore differences in addressing interest in different domains. Belle et al. [29] used
interesting and non-interesting video clips to assess the levels of attention and engagement
in study subjects. They used interesting clips in order to keep viewers attentive and engaged with the content presented. Non-interesting clips were intended to induce boredom
in the subjects and to reduce attentiveness. The researchers then studied differences in
physiological measures following the viewing of the two categories of video clips in the
participants. Here, the terms “interest,” “attention,” “engagement,” and “boredom” were
used to describe the stimuli and/or the participants’ reactions to the stimuli. Shen et al. [30]
described interest as one of eight basic learning emotions in their affective learning model.
Interest was also regarded as an academic emotion, along with confidence, excitement, and
frustration by Azcarraga in [31]. Other studies have investigated students’ interest in learning in terms of positive emotions displayed in the classroom. For example, Nor et al. [32]
studied student interest in learning science by observing four emotions, namely happiness,
fear, sadness, and calm. In a study by Shigemitsu and Nittono [33], the authors assessed
the level of interest while the subjects watched movies. The authors explained interest as
a representation of how strongly an audio-visual experience attracts a viewer’s interest.
The rest of the reviewed papers, did not specifically define interest [34]. Rather, interest in
these papers was described as an affective state [35,36] or described in detail in terms of its
different levels [37] and/or associated physiological patterns [38]. More details are given
in the appropriate sections of this paper.
Obviously, many of the objective studies presented here are not associated with or
refer to an appropriate psychological or theoretical model. Many theories and models
regarding interest development have been proposed. These models include, but are not
limited to the four-phase model for interest development by Hidi and Renninger [13],
the integrated model of interest development by Harackiewicz and Hulleman described
in [3], the psychology of constructive capriciousness by Silvia [39], the model of domain
learning by Alexander [40], and the person-object theory of interest [27,41]. The lack of
connection between physiological and psychological models, and the results obtained
based on these models, may cause confusion with similar cognitive and emotional concepts.

Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 1318

5 of 28

For example, the study by Belle et al. [29] used interesting versus non-interesting video clips
to assess participant’s attention and engagement. Therefore, it is unclear if the observed
physiological effects in this study were related to interest, engagement, attention, or all
three parameters at the same time. In fact, as mentioned earlier, interest has been described
as cognitive or emotional states, including engagement or pleasant tension. Furthermore,
Krapp stated that interest is a construct with cognitive and emotional intrinsic qualities and
values [42]. One possible way to distinguish interest from other states, e.g., engagement
or attention, is to monitor its development rather than studying it as a single emotional
or cognitive state. Therefore, it is advisable to suggest or provide evidence for links
between physiological and psychological studies in order to establish an informative,
well-established, and well-developed concept. However, as argued by Krapp and Krapp,
Renninger, and Hoffmann [27,43], one should not define or limit the meaning of interest
to only one specific aspect in order to establish a common definition. Instead, one should
develop a theoretical framework referring to different interest phenomena. Therefore,
we provide the reader with an overview of the different perspectives regarding interest
in this section. Although each model or theory is distinct from the others by different
reasoning and arguments, the models still overlap in some areas, e.g., the impactof interest
on individuals.
2.2. The Levels of Interest
The vast majority of research on interest based on the psychological point of view
suggests that there are two types of interest: individual and situational interest [11,27,44,45].
Individual interest is reflective of the preferences of an individual regarding a particular
subject or activity and their contributions to cognitive performance. In contrast, situational
interest comprises interest caused by environmental factors in most individuals, regardless
of their individual differences [14]. Nevertheless, it is still early to come to a conclusion
regarding the types or levels of interest from a physiological point of view. This may be due
to the smaller number of the physiological studies on “interest” compared to psychological
studies and the lack of adequate measures due to high cost, problems with temporal resolution, long computation time, etc. Here we highlight the numerous methods used to quantify
interest. Yeasin et al. [37] proposed using facial expressions to define levels of interest
based on the intensity and weight of emotion. The intensity of interest was computed by
considering the number of relative facial expression images for an emotion. The weight of
interest was computed using a three-dimensional effect space (arousal, stance, and valence)
discussed in [46]. Positive values of arousal, valence, and stance were associated with
positive expressions, while negative values of arousal, valence, and stance were associated
with negative expressions. This suggests that positive and negative values for interest are
reflective of high and low interest, respectively. However, it is not clear whether interest
can be initiated in the presence of negative affect. Interestingly, Hidi [6] has stated that
interest can also operate in affectively negative situations, although it is suggested that
affective states associated with interest tend to be positive. Nevertheless, negative affective
states have been reported to be associated with interest on rare occasions [47]. Using the
interactive system (iTourist) created by Qvarfordt and Zahi [38], the authors studied eye
gaze patterns to assess the subject’s interest. They measured the likelihood that a user was
interested in an object based on the object’s arousal level and eye-gaze intensity. Eye-gaze
intensity is modified by other eye-gaze factors, such as frequency of gaze and relative size
to baseline, which either inhibit or increase the object’s excitability. Mota and Picard [35]
studied postures to assess the learner’s interest. They classified interest as high, medium, or
low. However, the performance of the classifier in the above study was poor in identifying
medium interest. In addition, the classifier often had problems differentiating between
high and low interest. As a result, interest levels were only classified as “low interest”,
“high interest”, or “taking a break” in the final report. Studies of brain activity that use EEG
utilized different approaches to assess interest. The study by Babiker et al. [48] used 8 EEG
channels and classified interest into high situational interest and low situational interest.

The main advantage of using these methods is that they depend on the subject’s
physiological parameters, which cannot be manipulated voluntarily. The disadvantage of

Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 1318

these methods is the set-up time that has been significantly reduced with the advance in
technology in recent years. Furthermore, some of these sensors limit the structure of the
experimental stimulation, e.g., the mouse, which requires a computer application that uses
a mouse. The eye-tracker requires certain positions to ensure detection of the pupil of the
eye, which is not applicable in real settings.
Similarly, the seat pressure and the facial gestures require a standstill position that is
difficult in certain scenarios such as the classroom. In order to overcome the shortcomings
of these methods, they are combined in a way that sensor A detects the activities that sensor
B cannot detect. These sensors are also used separately or by combining two or more of
them depending on the application. The careful selection of a suitable physiological sensor
helps to achieve the best possible result.
To facilitate the study of sensors used to measure these parameters, this section was
divided into four subsections. Three subsections focused on groups of related sensors,
while the last section discussed the correlation between these physiological sensors and
self-report. A brief introduction is provided for each sensor in the appropriate subsection.
3.1. EEG and ECG Patterns
As shown in Table 1 below, the EEG channels and devices used vary from one study
to another. This diversity in equipment specifications could be related to the differences in
the purpose of the study, brain areas of interest, availability of devices, cost of devices, and
required features. We are interested in patterns of brain activity leading to high detection
and/or prediction rates for the state of interest. EEG may be the widely most studied tool
in computational studies of emotional systems [51]. This is because new EEG products
are more flexible and portable, relatively low cost, and produce high-quality data using
fewer channels. In addition, some EEG devices are using dry sensors. EEG devices record
brain activity in the form of electrical signals measured in microvolts and/or millivolts.
These signals are produced by the brain and are recorded by placing specific electrodes
on the scalp. Compared to functional magnetic resonance imaging, EEG produces data
with a better temporal resolution, as it can acquire signals in milliseconds. Raw EEG data
must undergo pre-processing, which includes, but is not limited to cleaning, that includes
noise removal and filtering techniques, in order to be suitable for processing and analysis.
Table 1 also lists other sensors that are normally used along with EEG, including ECG, GSR
sensors, HR sensors, and electrooculography (EOG), which are known to produce data
indicative of the emotional state of the subject. ECG devices record changes in electrical
activity across the heart. ECG recordings are performed with each heartbeat over time in
a process similar to HR sensor. Increases in HR may reflect cognitive processing, while
decreased HR is indicative of attention to environmental stimuli [52]. GSR sensors are
attached to the fingers of the subject’s non-dominant hand. Correlations between HR
and GSR parameters and valence and arousal are highlighted in several studies, e.g., [53].
EOG is sensitive and is used for correcting and cleaning eye blinking artifacts. All the
EEG studies described below utilized questionnaires to confirm, classify, or support the
findings based on data from the physiological sensors. We will not discuss this aspect of
the studies, as this paper aims to examine physiological parameters. For further review of
the subjective measures of interest, the reader is advised to see [54,55]. We, therefore, only
mention the use of questionnaires when necessary. Another topic of interest is the baseline
session or the resting-state period. These sessions are used to obtain data from the subject
in neutral or stimulus-free conditions. The duration of the baseline recording varies from
one experiment to another and often ranges between 1 and 5 min in EEG studies. Because
the physiological state of an individual is subjective and varies regularly, recording the
baseline state is essential when comparing the subject’s state in the presence or absence
of a stimulation. Differences between these two conditions (baseline and stimulation) are
later used for further analyses and calculations.

Vecchiato et al. [8] have referred to interest as an approach-withdrawal (AW) index.
They computed this index by assessing the difference between the average power of the
alpha band recorded from left and right EEG frontal lobes channels. Specifically, increased
AW indicates an increase in the subject’s interest and vice versa. We can interpret the
relationship between this measure and interest by the two fundamental motivational
dimensions: approach and withdrawal (also called avoidance). The approach system
may be related to appetitive behavior, interest, movement toward a goal, or the “I want”
response. In contrast, the avoidance system or withdrawal is associated with defensive
withdrawal, pain, failure, or the “I do not want” response [6]. This is discussed by Larsen
and Augustine [59], who stated that positive effect promotes exploratory behavior and
that if an individual is experiencing positive affect, he or she would seek to broaden
and continue this experience. The authors also stated that “the experience of interest
encourages one to approach novel situations, ideas, and individuals that are related to the
object of interest”.
Peterson et al. [60] found a relationship between greater left frontal activation and
approach motivation, while greater right frontal activity is associated with withdrawal
motivation [61]. This is true, regardless of the valence of emotion [62]. Many studies
have reported anger, which is an approach-oriented negative emotion, to be associated
with relatively greater left frontal brain activation than right frontal activation. Thus,
interest may be described as effect reflective of high levels of approach, as stated by
Harmon-Jones [62]. Davidson et al. [63] have proposed that greater left-sided dorsolateral
activity might be related to approach-related, goal-directed action planning. Discussion of
emotional processing in the prefrontal and frontal cortex and the approach-withdrawal
model by Davidson [64] explains the use of the AW index by Vecchiato et al. [8] and the
utilization of only the frontal channels in EEG. It is worth mentioning that greater left
frontal activation than right brain activation was not observed in all studies. As proposed
by Harmon-Jones et al. [65], this may be because the stimulation failed to involve the
subjects personally and/or failed to provide the expectation of an action, which is essential
for approach motivation.
The alpha band can be used to assess interest, as it can be used to determine the AW
index. Recently, it was reported [66] that alpha asymmetry measures yielded significant
correlation patterns for frontal and parietal asymmetry. The findings of the above study
indicate that greater behavioral activation system activity is related to greater left-sided
activation. However, Vecchiato et al. did not report whether data from bands other than
the alpha band can be used to obtain similar AW index values to quantify interest. It likely
takes less time to use data from a single band, although using more than one band may
enhance and improve the results.
After filtering (the data were band-pass filtered at 2–30 Hz), Vecchiato et al. segmented
the data and analyzed their results using independent component analysis, wherein a
common average reference was computed, and the individual alpha frequencies were
acquired as suggested by Klimesch [67]. The authors found differences related to the way
the two video clips were observed between men and women. Women had higher interest in
some scenes of both clips, while men were interested in other scenes. This led to variegated
patterns for the different cerebral variables.
Belle et al. [29] used two EEG channels (FP1 and FP2) and ECG measurements to
assess cognitive attention. The main objective of the study was to investigate whether ECG
signals can be used to measure an individual’s attention and focus, and EEG was used as a
benchmark. In this case, ECG could be more practical than EEG because it is more portable
and reliable during a variety of activities and executive tasks. However, EEG produces a
larger amount of accurate data.
ECG data were pre-processed, and statistical features such as mean, sum, and mean
of autocovariance were extracted. After pre-processing, wavelet transform was carried out,
then, the data were decomposed, and features such as standard deviation, entropy, mean of
frequencies, and variance of probability distribution were extracted (for extensive details of

Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 1318

11 of 28

the processing and decomposition procedures, see [29]). All the features from both channels
were fed into three different classifiers: C4.5, random forest, and classification via regression
to classify the data into two categories: attention and inattention. These classifiers were
selected because the numbers of training and testing data points were not largely used.
The highest accuracy was achieved by the random forest classifier and was 77% and 86%
for ECG and EEG data, respectively. The above experiment demonstrated the superiority
of EEG for the detection of cognitive attention (by almost 9%) when compared to ECG.
However, the findings of the study also illustrated the feasibility of ECG in determining
the attentional status of an individual and showed that fluctuations in attention have
recognizable and considerable effects on cardiac rhythm.
One issue that was not addressed by the authors is the sequence of the presented
stimulation. The stimulation comprised 20 min of interesting clips, including high-speed
car chases and popular movie scenes, followed by 20 min of non-interesting or specifically
boring clips containing repetitive video and still images. It is not clear whether the same
accuracy values would be obtained if the stimulation sequence were reversed, i.e., starting
with the boring clips and then moving on to the interesting clips. Furthermore, the manner
in which the clips were rated as interesting or non-interesting was not described.
Another issue is the detection of attention. Considering that the stimulations used
were categorized as interesting or non-interesting, along with the composition of the stimuli
in each category, it is not clear why the authors used the term cognitive attention instead of
interest. For example, the study in [37], used interesting stimuli that contained clips from
movies to assess interest or the level of interest in subjects. Furthermore, non-interesting
stimuli that contained clips with still images have also been used by researchers to measure
the level of interest [33]. Since interest is defined as focused attention and, as described
earlier by Dewey, as “being engaged, engrossed, or entirely taken up with” an activity,
object or topic [14], is it therefore reasonable to refer to the state resulting from the viewing
of the interesting stimuli as “interest” and to the attention resulting from interest in the
presented stimulus as selective attention? We may not be able to accurately answer this
question based on the limited information provided. Although this study clearly indicates
that cognitive and physiological effects measured by EEG and ECG have common aspects
while the subject views interesting and non-interesting stimuli.
Fukai et al. [56] used a laboratory-made device that utilized one frontal channel placed
over the frontal region of the brain (FP1). The author selected the frontal region because EEG
change in this region is clearly noticeable [56]. The FP1 is located over the left frontal lobe
of the brain according to the international 10–20 system. Therefore, the above discussion
regarding the definition of interest as an approach motivation also holds true for this work.
The raw EEG data collected each second were processed using Fourier transform. After
transforming the EEG data to their respective frequency components, a moving average
filter was used to account for perception time, remaining time, and measuring error. Cluster
analysis was then used to classify the subjects based on the amplitudes of EEG spectra with
frequencies of 4–22 Hz. Finally, multiple regression analysis was used to quantitatively
evaluate the degree of human interest. The estimation model was constructed based on
training data using EEG features and the results of questionnaires. Based on the analysis
results, the authors considered the combination of waves at 6 and 10 Hz to be associated
with “favorite”, the combination of waves at 11 and 16 Hz with “dislikeable” for haptic
sense, the combination of waves at 4 and 7 Hz with “favorite”, the combination of waves at
9 and 14 Hz with “dislikeable” and dozing was associated with waves at 5, 6, 9, and 16 Hz.
While the study addressed the effects of television commercials, which are normally visual
stimuli, the authors did not clarify the meaning or usage of the terms haptic and olfactory
senses in the results section. Thus, it is not clear if the combination of waves with these
frequencies is related to the type of television commercial product, e.g., those with odor,
which triggers the olfactory organs, or if the authors are referring to other uncited studies
that they had carried previously. Comparing the results of the questionnaire used by the

Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 1318

12 of 28

subjects to rate their interest levels to those obtained using the proposed system yielded an
accuracy of 79.6%.
Nomura and Mitsukura [49] carried out their experiment using the same EEG device
described in the above report. The purpose of their study, however, was to detect latent
emotions experienced by subjects while watching television commercials. The authors
specified these emotions as like, interest, concentration, drowsiness, and stress. The experiment included 100 Japanese television commercials falling into one of two categories:
award-winning and non-award-winning. The commercials were randomly ordered and
differed between subjects. Both categories contained television commercials of two different lengths: 15 s and 30 s. Questionnaires were used to evaluate the subjects’ emotions after
they had watched 10 television commercials. One month after viewing the commercials,
the subjects were asked to name television commercials that they found memorable. The
EEG device “KANSEI” was used to calculate percentage values for the aforementioned
five emotions (0%: low degree to 100%: high degree) by converting the raw EEG data to a
frequency domain spectrum using fast Fourier transform.
This study is thus far the only one that investigated the effects of the stimulus length
on the subject’s emotions while viewing a stimulus. Fifteen-second television commercials
induced increases in the subjects’ stress levels. In contrast, 30-s commercials decreased the
subjects’ stress. The authors argue that this is because the 15-s commercials are required
to present sufficient information within a limited time, while the 30-s commercials have
double the time to create and present emotional content, such as a storyline. The authors
found significant correlations for only two emotions out of the five studied (including
interest): concentration and stress. Therefore, the study focused on concentration and
stress, and did not discuss interest or the other two states (like and drowsiness) in depth.
Hence, the significant contribution of this study to the field could be the procedure and
experimental design, but not the outcomes or the result. The importance of the correlation
between stress and concentration, which led to the exclusion of the other non-significant
correlations and their respective emotions, was not clarified. Moreover, since the device
was used to perform all the processing, the reliability of the calculations and classifications
need to be inspected.
Suzuki et al. [34] examined the applicability of another method used to assess the
level of interest. P3 is known to reflect mental workload and attention paid to a task [68].
The authors used this information to extend the work of Rosenfeld et al. [69] by using
a three-tone oddball task to assess the level of interest in the subjects. In this paradigm,
when an interesting or non-interesting video is played (primary task), the subject is asked
to simultaneously respond to an occasional presented auditory stimulus. This technique is
based on the idea that there is a fixed capacity for attention. Thus, the greater the attention
required by the task, the less the resources available to probe stimulus. This, in turn, will
cause a reduction in P3 amplitude.
The authors of the study differentiated between interesting and neutral states using
video clips that were interesting or neutral (neither non-interesting nor boring). The use
of interesting vs. neutral stimuli is thought to allow investigation of the effects of interest
on the brain in a more proper manner than using interesting vs. boring stimuli, because
“boring” stimuli might be biased. EEG data were recorded using 21 channels covering most
brain areas (frontal lobe, central, parietal lobe, and occipital lobe) besides recording EOG
data. Since the experiment used probe stimuli, the correct responses were defined and used
to obtaining event-related potential (ERP) waveforms. Scalp topographic maps containing
P3 data were drawn after pre-processing and computation. Statistical analysis was then
performed to confirm the finding that P3 amplitude decreased when the subjects viewed
interesting video clips when compared to neutral stimuli. This finding is consistent with
that of Rosenfeld et al. [69], who reported that P3 is a sensitive indicator of the subject’s
interest in video clips.
The authors found a significant difference between the neutral and control conditions
only for the deviant P3a, and not for the P3b. The authors, therefore, claimed the superiority

Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 1318

13 of 28

of the deviant P3 over the target P3 for the assessment of the amount of residual processing
resources. This may be explained by the fact that the task demand of the target stimulus,
which the subjects were required to respond to, was higher than that of the deviant target,
which the subjects could neglect. This would have led to the allocation of more processing
resources for the target stimuli. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the frontocentral P3a component might be more sensitive to resource availability than the parietal P3b component.
Nevertheless, further research is required to investigate and confirm the above hypothesis,
which opens a new direction for the investigation of interest.
According to the cognitive model discussed by Polich [70], the P3a originates during
task processing by stimulus-driven frontal attention mechanisms, while the P3b originates
due to temporal-parietal activity associated with attention and seems to be related to
subsequent memory processing and storage. In some way, one may thus argue that prior
knowledge, which requires memory processing and updating of operations to relate given
information to stored information, is not necessary for the triggering of interest. While
many psychological studies have reported a weak or no relationship between interest
and prior knowledge e.g., [71–73] other studies have reported significant correlations
between interest and knowledge, e.g., [74]. There is debate regarding the manner in
which prior knowledge affects interest, although the effects of interest on knowledge are
acknowledged. The four-phase model suggested by Hidi and Renninger [13] describes the
first two phases of interest development as composed of focused attention and positive
feeling, while the latter two phases consist of knowledge and stored values, along with
positive feelings. Research on interest should carefully consider this issue, as low or high
levels of knowledge are expected to decrease the level of interest, while a moderate level of
knowledge is reported in some studies to generate interest [75,76] (for a review see [77]).
The study conducted by Shigemitsu and Nittono [33] suggested the utilization of N140
and P300 elicited by a vibratory probe stimulus to assess interest in subjects presented
with particular content. In this study, the authors collected EEG and EOG data from 18
subjects while they watched interesting videos, boring videos, and still images. Unlike the
Suzuki study, wherein auditory probe stimuli were used, the authors of this study used a
somatosensory (vibratory) probe stimulus to account for the masking problem, which may
occur when auditory probe stimuli are used. Specifically, it is likely that the auditory probe
might be masked when other auditory materials are presented at the same time. After
data pre-processing and filtering, ERPs were calculated separately for each participant and
condition. The N140 and P300 were then defined and computed, and the peak amplitude
and latency were measured (Cz for N140 and Pz for P300). The mean power in the alpha
band (8–12.5 Hz) was computed at the Oz site (occipital midline).
As expected, the subjective ratings indicated that subjects allocated more attention
to the interesting clips and less attention to the probe stimuli. This was not the case for
boring clips, which drew less attention. The N140 was significantly smaller in amplitude
when the subjects viewed interesting clips when compared to boring clips. As noted by
Kida et al. [78], the amplitude of N140 is an indicator of a passive shift in attention. This to
some extent explains the change in N140 during the viewing of interesting videos, which
captured the subject’s attention, when compared to the boring videos or the still images.
Interestingly, the P300 amplitude decreased when the subjects viewed interesting videos
when compared to boring clips or still pictures. However, the difference was not significant
between the two conditions. This suggests that the N140 elicited by vibratory stimuli might
be more sensitive in measuring the attention resulting from the viewing of interesting
content than the P300.
The authors further assessed the effects of interesting content on the alpha band. They
found that alpha amplitude was attenuated in the interesting condition when compared to
the boring condition or the still picture condition. This finding was in line with the previous
findings of Smith et al. [79]. The authors proposed the use of N140 amplitude elicited by
vibratory probe stimuli, along with the power of the alpha band recorded from the occipital
lobe using EEG, as a useful index of the subject’s interest in audio-visual content.

Azcarraga et al. [31] used an Emotiv EPOC device with 14 channels. They achieved an
accuracy of 73% in the detection of interest, excitement, frustration, and confidence when
using EEG and mouse behavior data. In this study, the difference between the raw EEG
value and the mean value of the baseline data was normalized and segmented into 2-s bins.
Each segment was then treated as a single instance. Mouse data, including number of clicks,
distance traveled, and click duration, were used in addition to the EEG data. The EEG data,
data on mouse clicks, and self-report data were synchronized and merged. The EEG data
and data on mouse clicks were labeled based on the self-report data. Data were then fed to
two different classifiers: a support vector machine (SVM) and a multi-layer perceptron. The
F-measures were higher when using brainwaves only than when only using mouse data.
The F-measure was highest when both modalities were combined. The F-measure reached
73% for the average of all emotions when using the MLP classifier and was lower (51%)
when using the SVM classifier. It should be noted that data from 16 out of the 25 subjects
were valid for feeding into the classifiers. This is because the number of instances of the
occurrence of the four emotions was required to be balanced. Interestingly, the F-measure
was improved when the authors used “outliers”, which were defined as values deviating
from the mean by at least one standard deviation. The F-measure reached 92% for the
average of all emotions when using the MLP for combined modalities (brainwaves and
mouse) data and reached 97% for “interest.” According to the authors, interest was likely
the most frequently occurring emotion during the learning process in this particular study
and was related to the subject’s engagement.
The authors hypothesized that the high accuracy values obtained when using the
outliers were likely due to the smaller sample size because only the outliers were used
in the calculations. However, this is probably inaccurate, as the MLP, SVM, and machine
learning algorithms, in general, are known to produce better results when larger sample
sizes are used. An explanation could be that the outliers were not, in fact, mistakes or false
data from the devices, but rather real data that deviated from the mean. For instance, an
interesting subject might be so engaged at some points of the presentation that he/she
performs mouse click movements different from the earlier movements. The same effects
may occur in the EEG data. The authors of the study suggested the utilization of outliers
when assessing emotions, and specific interest, to achieve high accuracy.
The MLP was found to be superior to the SVM in cases where the data are known to
have regular and unpredicted variations. In addition, mouse data alone were shown to be
insufficient for the accurate detection of the emotional states of learners, which suggests the
need for additional measures to assess brain activities. Using combinations of modalities
was found to be a powerful strategy and led to more accurate results, as will be discussed
in the following sections.
Morillo et al. [80] also used the Emotiv EPOC to assess whether the subjects liked
certain television advertisements based on their interest in the content. The authors defined
three levels of interest and distraction: High (high interest and low impact of distraction),
Medium (high interest and noticeable impact of distraction), and Low (low interest and high
impact of distraction). This information was added to the profiles of the subjects, which
also contained the subjects’ ratings of how much they liked each advertisement on a scale
of 1 to 5. The EEG data were pre-processed, filtered, and then divided into two categories:
dislike (rated lower than 3), and like (rated higher than 3). The data were then fed into
three different classifiers: neural network, decision tree-based approach, and Ameva-based
approach (for more details, see [80]). The neural network was superior in classifying
the data. The authors also proposed a new approach based on the Ameva algorithm
that allowed them to discretize the system’s inputs. The proposed discrete classification
technique based on the Ameva algorithm in this study required less computation time and
had higher accuracy than C4.5 and comparable accuracy to neural the network.
Nor et al. [32] studied interest by investigating emotions. The authors suggested four
emotions, namely happiness, sadness, calmness, and fear, to be used to determine student’s
interest in science and math. The authors claimed that it might be possible to predict the

Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 1318

15 of 28

subject’s interest using neural network MLP to analyze the features of EEG activity recorded
while answering mathematics and science questions. First, an effective space model (ASP)
was generated for each subject based on EEG activity recorded while the subject viewed
images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). These images depicted
the emotions of happiness, fear, calmness, and sadness. The ASP information was then
used to encode the subject’s emotion during the science and mathematics tests. Emotional
responses were elicited using Bernard Bouchard’s synthesized musical clips and Gross
and Levenson’s movie clips. Each clip lasted for one and one-half minutes, during which
time EEG activities were recorded. As in the previous experiments, subjective responses
and ratings were obtained after the viewing of each video clip. The students were then
required to answer scientific and mathematical questions in two separate tests. Raw EEG
data were pre-processed, filtered, and the features were extracted using mel-frequency
cepstral coefficients, which then were fed into a neural network (MLP) to classify the
data into two categories: valence and arousal. According to the authors, positive valence
and negative arousal were identified as calmness, positive valence and positive arousal
were identified as happiness, negative valence and negative arousal were identified as
sadness, and negative valence and positive arousal were identified as fear. Because only
data from one subject were analyzed, the results of this study are not discussed to avoid
bias and perhaps the presentation of inaccurate information. Even though the importance
of a learner’s emotional state to effective learning is highlighted in recent research, the
authors did not elaborate on or explain the reasons for choosing the above four emotions
and not other emotions, e.g., hopefulness, confusion, or frustration, which are well known
to affect the learning process and are referred to as learner’s emotions in several studies,
e.g., [33,81].
The discussed studies in this section showed the feasibility of using EEG to detect
interest. The number of EEG channels, in this case, ranged between 1 and 33 channels. The
majority of these channels were placed in the frontal brain regions which are claimed to
play a significant role in detecting interest. Several methods and classifiers were employed
for analyzing and classifying EEG data and are summarized in Table 1 with their respective
accuracy. ECG modality was also employed successfully to detect interest, but it had
lower performance than EEG. Differences in experimental designs should be considered in
interpreting the result because certain stimulations might be more effective than others,
e.g., using video clips from movies compared to using tests and educational content.
3.2. Eye-Tracking Patterns
Eye-tracking has been used in many applications because of improved system capabilities, low cost compared to other devices, and the possibility of designing algorithms
according to one’s needs. Eye-tracking has been used to detect the point of interest that the
participant is looking at, interesting texts read by the participant, and interesting information presented to the participant while surfing the web, among other features. Based on the
selection criteria, the studies included here were those that directly detected the interesting
feeling or cognitive state and/or its levels and contributed to the characterization of interest.
Table 2 lists the studies presented here, wherein the authors attempted to detect interest in
two different areas: tourism (commercial) and learning.

In [83], the authors developed a system to detect learner’s eyes in order to enhance the
learning experience. The system uses OpenCV tools to first detect the eyes and then the eye
pupils.. It then uses this information to detect and interpret the learner’s behavior, interest,
and attentiveness. This system detected interest by recording the direction toward which
the learner gazed and by counting the number of fixations by the learner in a particular
region. To keep the learner’s attention, the system sounded an alarm when the eyes were
not detected within a specified time period. In addition, the area between the user and the
web camera was defined and recorded, so that continued fluctuations in the data collected
from this region were indicative of the inattentiveness of the learner. The time period
between the loss of eye detection and the re-detection of the eyes was also recorded. If this
time period was frequently longer than 1 s, is the system assumed that the individual was
probably not focusing or that his/her attention was distracted or diverted. However, the
system sometimes lost detection of the learner’s eyes even when the learner was still in
front of the web camera. This loss was identified by its duration, which was shorter than
one second. The advantages of this system were: the achievement of a true acceptance
rate of 75% for detecting eyes and pupils, low cost, and compatibility with any computer
equipped with a web camera. The system nevertheless had some limitations, e.g., it could
not detect the eyes if more than one head was shown in the image, it was affected by
luminance, and was inoperative when the background had high illumination. The irises of
the eyes could not be detected when they were located at the corners of the eyes. Moreover,
although the system was tested for the detection of eyes and pupils, it also requires testing
in real learning settings to assess the interest and behavior of a learner.
The learning system proposed by Asteriadis et al. [82] is a full extension of the LTSA
IEEE learning system initially described in [84]. This system consisted of 3 different
entities: processes, stores, and flows. It performed all the analyses and computations of the
learner’s states and the durations of the states online. This information was then stored
in the learner’s records for future reference. One advantage of this system was its ability
to build and update different profiles for different learners based on both their current
behavior and their stored profile. In other words, the system considered the individual
differences of the learners and their different modes of behavior and learning at different
times. Another advantage of the system was providing feedback to enhance the learning
process. For instance, a highlighted text modified based on the subject’s state is shown to
an inattentive subject.
The architecture of the model consisted of head pose estimation, eye gaze estimation,
positions of hands during the video, a fraction of the inter-ocular distance between frames
(by monitoring the variation in the distance between the user and the computer screen),
and facial features (eye blinking, frowning, mouth opening, eyes wide open, or not moving
at all). These features were fed into a neuro-fuzzy inference system, which then decides
the status of the user as frustrated, struggling to read, distracted, tired/sleepy, not paying
attention, attentive, or full of interest. In this experiment, the subjects had difficulty
decoding written text (dyslexia). As a result, dyslexia experts annotated the video clips
used as “ground truth”. The actual features of the testing set were the region around the
eyes, eyebrows, mouth, and/or features related to hand location and movement. Only two
states were detected and reported. The accuracy was 100% for attentive individuals and
72% for inattentive individuals, with an average absolute error between the output and
annotation of 0.117. The state of the user was noted as attentive if the output value was
greater than 0.5 and inattentive otherwise. However, the algorithm was still incapable of
detecting some features, such as “frozen lips”. Therefore, some states were not accurately
detected or not detected at all.
The work by Qvarfordt and Zhai [38] is interesting because it utilized a real-life application. The interest of subjects was detected based on eye-gaze patterns in an interactive
system called iTourist, which is used for city trip planning. Two types of eye-gaze patterns
associated with a person’s interest in an object on the screen were identified. The first
pattern comprised accumulated time and high intensity of a participant’s gaze toward

Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 1318

18 of 28

an object on the screen. The second pattern comprised the gaze of the participant on the
surrounding objects related to the object of interest. The authors also found that frequent
eye-gaze switching between two objects indicated an interest in the relationship between
the two objects, e.g., participants were found to switch eye gaze between a hotel and a
museum when they were interested in the museum and wished to book a nearby hotel.
The system, which was implemented fully in C++, provided information to the users
regarding an interesting place based solely on eye-gaze information. However, it had some
limitations. For example, it falsely provided information that the participants were not
interested and provided this information for a while before stopping. In addition, the
system often missed providing information regarding places of interest. Nevertheless, the
overall reaction of participants was quite positive.
The studies discussed above showed the potential of using an eye-tracking system to
detect subject’s interest. The availability of such equipment and the high obtained accuracy
especially in educational and tourism perspectives makes it promising and opens the door
for more creative ideas. The relatively few numbers of studies compared to EEG modality
suggest the need of further research in this area. However, the studies also showed that
eye-tracking needs to be combined with other modalities to improve its performance. This
is because the eye movement is an indicator of several conditions, and using it separately
could result in an inaccurate result.
3.3. Patterns Obtained Using Other Sensors
Several other types of sensors are used to detect interest in subjects while they view
stimuli. These sensors may include pressure sensors that are placed on the subject’s
seat, conductance bracelets, and pressure mouse devices. The authors of the following
studies, which are listed in Table 3, evaluated the interest of subjects while they played an
educational game, watched movies and used a tutoring system. More details regarding
these studies are described below.
We discuss the use of multimodality systems in this section. The studies discussed
previously in this review used telemetry biopotential measures such as EEG and ECG,
which measure the electrical potential between two electrodes, or eye-tracking. Here,
pressure mouse devices, pressure seats, cameras, and conductance bracelets are used to
measure variables related to interest. There is thus a diversity of physiological sensors used
to detect interest.
Kapoor et al. [85] proposed the use of a multi-sensor affect recognition system to
classify interest and disinterest in children while solving an educational puzzle on a
computer. The approach was based on using a mixture of Gaussian processes to analyze
facial features, current posture, and level of activity, as determined using a camera and
a pressure seat, respectively. Information regarding the level of difficulty and the state
of the game were obtained from the computer. The postures were labeled by teachers
who viewed the camera and the chair details before the experiment. Posture was the most
discriminating feature and had an accuracy of 81.97%. The accuracy for discrimination
between interesting and uninteresting stimuli increased to 86.55% after considering all of
the other features. Only 50 samples out of the 136 had features from all the modalities. The
remaining samples lacked details from the face channel. The number of samples classified
as “interested” was 65 and the number of samples considered “uninterested” was 71. Only
9 children were involved in this study. This highlights the need for studies with a larger
sample size.

The study by Mota et al. [35] is the oldest of the studies discussed in this paper. This
study is similar to the previous experiments outlined in Table 3 in terms of subject age and
the sensors used, but differs in its purpose and classification algorithm. This study is also
slightly different from the other studies in terms of features extraction. The purpose of
this study was to measure the level of interest in learners while they played a constraint
satisfaction game called Fripples Place over a period of 20 min. After acquiring the data
using a camera and a pressure chair, three teachers separately labeled the data based on
videos recorded by the cameras. These classifications had an average agreement of 78.57%,
and this strategy was used because children are less likely to provide accurate statements
about their feelings than adults are. After data pre-processing and noise removal, the data
were modeled using a mixture of Gaussian processes. The Gaussian parameters were then
fed into a 3-layer feed-forward neural network, which achieved an average static posture
classification accuracy of 87.64%. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) were then used to
model posture sequences for the affective states identified earlier by the teachers. These
affective states were high interest, low interest, and taking a break. Medium interest was
eliminated as an affective state because the model always confused this state with the
high- or low-interest states, which resulted in poor performance. The final model had an
average accuracy of 82.25% for classifying high interest, low interest, and taking a break.
The study provided evidence that the observed patterns in the dynamics of the student’s
postures contained significant information related to the affective states of high interest,
low interest, or taking a break. However, higher sample sizes are required in physiological
studies to enhance model robustness and to obtain more validated results. The authors of
this study also did not explain how they measured or quantified high vs. low interest or
the theoretical or experimental basis for this measurement.
Arroyo et al. [88] studied the applicability of physiological sensors in detecting student
emotions during intelligent tutoring classes. As shown in Table 3, the authors performed
two experiments: one with school students and another with undergraduate students.
They used self-reports with several physiological sensors, including a camera for facial
expression recognition, pressure-sensitive seat cushions and back pads with audiometers,
pressure mouse devices, and wireless conductance bracelets. These sensors were used
to detect four emotional conditions: interested, confident, excited, and frustrated. The
aim of the research was to find an alternative to the use of classical contextual variables
such as time spent to solve a problem, number of hints given by the tutor, and number of
attempts. The authors found a significant correlation between pre-test scores and interest.
In particular, students with better mathematical knowledge reported higher interest than
those with less extensive mathematical knowledge.
The authors showed that the feeling reported during each self-report question was
related to what the subjects faced just before the question was presented. Therefore, when
a subject self-reported, “I feel frustrated”, it was likely because they had one or more
incomplete attempts in solving the previous problem. Similarly, when a subject reported,
“I feel confident”, it was because he/she had just solved a problem. This was verified using
stepwise regression, which indicated that interest (variance of 14%) could be predicted
based on incorrect attempts and the gender of the learning companion. One limitation of
this proposal was the unavailability of all the sensors used at the same time for all students
due to several practical problems. The contribution from the camera sensor alone accounted
for 52% of the variance in detecting confidence. The camera had similar contributions to
the detection of other emotions. Using these sensors can help the tutor predict more than
60% of the variance in the student’s emotional state. The R values for the fit models used
for the four emotions when using all the sensors and the tutor were 0.82, 0.72, and 0.70
for the confident, frustrated, and excited states, respectively. However, no fit model was
found for the interested state. As mentioned earlier, the sensor data were only analyzed for
50% of the students due to difficulties in assessing all of the subjects using all the sensors
simultaneously.

The study by Yeasin et al. [86] represents one of several studies that uses facial
expressions to detect emotions and interest e.g., [89,90] (for a review, see [91]). However,
only the Yeasin et al. study is discussed here because it used information from six emotions
(surprise, sadness, fear, anger, happiness, and disgust) to measure the level of interest of
subjects while they watch different movie clips. This study thus proposes a new indirect
way of measuring the level of interest of an individual while he/she interacts with a
machine. To measure the level of interest, the authors used a three-dimensional affect space
(discussed in [92]). Each affective state was described using three parameters: arousal,
valence, and stance (discussed in the level of interest section in this paper). A weight W,
which was calculated by summing the contributions of each parameter, was assigned to
each expression and then multiplied by the intensity (I) of that expression to compute the
level of interest (L) using L = W × I.
The proposed algorithm for facial expression recognition achieved an average accuracy
of 90.9% using a Cohn–Kanade database. The algorithm had significantly higher accuracy
in recognizing happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise when compared to fear and disgust.
This study suggests that a two-step classification system is more efficient than a direct
classification system, as the authors obtained better results when using both K-nearest
neighbors and discrete HMM algorithms compared to continuous HMM. To validate
their analysis of expressions and level of interest, the authors conducted an experiment
with 21 subjects watching movie clips. The data were labeled with six emotions by three
individuals who did not know the content of the videos. The recognition accuracy of the
proposed algorithm was 82.1%.
Furthermore, in order to use real data instead of laboratory data, the authors collected
108 sequences from television broadcasts, including different facial expressions used worldwide. Three individuals labeled these data. The accuracy achieved was 72% due to the
misclassification of surprise, fear, anger, and disgust, in addition to the unbalanced distribution of subject sex, age, and ethnicity between the test and training sets. The algorithm
used had difficulty classifying the emotions correctly when the subject was talking. It also
tended to misclassify expressions with similar patterns, such as fear and surprise, and
sadness and disgust.
The above studies discuss the feasibility of using sensors that depend on the pose
or the dynamic of the subject’s posture to detect interest. There was a need to use more
than one sensor at a time to improve classification accuracy. Compared to the EEG, ECG,
and eye-tracking, these sensors had less accuracy and required more time and resources
to handle and synchronize the data. However, it provided an insight into the effect of
interest on physiological measures. Moreover, the subjective measures used especially by
the academic staff had increased the reliability of the physiological measure. That could be
a significant contribution to improve the educational environment by strengthening the
student-educator relationship.
3.4. Correlation between Self-Report and Physiological Sensors
The correlation between self-report and physiological measures has been discussed
widely from different perspectives (for a review, see [93–95]). In this section, this correlation
will be addressed with regard to interest.
The reviewed studies showed great potential for detecting interest using physiological
sensors. However, subjective measures, especially the self-report method, was employed
in the majority of these studies as presented in the measurement column of Tables 1–3.
The self-report method is accepted as the gold standard for determining one’s status and
is often used with physiological measures to enhance and support their result. This is
because of the long history and the solid basic research that used the self-report method
and because of the lack of adequate physiological equipment at earlier times. The question
would be to what extent can we trust the self-report method, especially if it conflicted with
the result of physiological measures? On the one hand, there have been serious concerns
raised about the credibility of the self-report method in certain conditions such as classroom

Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 1318

22 of 28

sessions or for certain groups such as children. On the other hand, concerns have been
raised as well about the result of physiological measures that could be affected by the
individual’s health condition or by faulty equipment. This implies that each method will
have its pros and cons and that combining methods or modalities could be a good way to
avoid such conflict in the first place. Recent studies employed different methods such as
cameras [48], interviews [38], mouse behavior [31], etc. This was applicable for two reasons:
(1) interest can be reported subjectively and/ or objectively unlike pain, for example, which
is considered a subjective phenomenon [96] and (2) the advances in technology that made
it easy to incorporate two or more modalities.
Hence, it is recommended to combine subjective and objective measures when applicable to measure interest in all of its richness. Subjective measures report how one’s feel
and think consciously about certain condition while the objective measures are necessary
to tell about the unconscious mechanisms underlying this feeling or thought. This will
offer complementary information about the association between interest, environmental
condition, behavior, and brain and will have a valuable contribution to the understanding
of the nature of interest. it is suggested to combine both measures until finding a credible
and reliable physiological index that will overcome self-report limitations.
4. Effects of the Experimental Design on Experiment Output
Some of the physiological studies discussed here aimed to provide an index for the
state or the process of interest. Other studies aimed to identify behavioral phenomena in
response to the presence of a physiological event or response suggested being associated
with interest. Before discussing the factors that affect the outcomes of physiological
experiments, some issues should be highlighted for future consideration. Many of the
experimental designs discussed in this review are limited by what is known as hypotheticdeductive logic. In other words, these studies relied on the identification of a physiological
response differentiating the presence vs. absence of “interest”. These studies may be
considered to have weak experimental design, as stated by Cacioppo and Tassinary [97].
This is because associating the presence of interest with certain physiological responses
does not imply that the converse is true. Thus, there is a need for considerable effort
to make accurate inferences regarding the presence or absence of certain physiological
effects or responses based on a psychological phenomenon. Another consideration is the
signal acquisition, cleaning, and analysis processes, which were intentionally discussed
in this paper in order to give the reader an opportunity to visualize the effects of these
processes on the outcomes of experiments. Cacioppo and L. G. Tassinary [97] stated that
“the appearance of unreliable psychophysiological relations can also stem from imprecision
during signal acquisition on the psychological side of the equation”. For example, the
occurrence of one or more emotions at the same time as the targeted emotion will lead
to inappropriate detection or identification of that targeted emotion. In addition, some
analysis methods may mask important identification parameters or introduce falsified
parameters.
4.1. Task and Stimulation
The stimulation is a major component of the experiment because if it fails to induce the
respective emotion in the participant with the required intensity, the results and findings
will be inaccurate or non-significant. As seen in the previous sections, the stimuli differed
widely in length, type, and intensity depending on the experimental setting and the
purpose of the study. To validate the stimuli, some authors used a pre-selected stimulus
that was well-categorized [86]. Alternatively, the authors used pre-tests [34], wherein they
used multiple comparisons analyzed using Bonferroni t-tests to show that clips A and B
were rated significantly more interesting that clips C and D. These data were later tested to
determine whether they were in agreement with the outcomes of the physiological sensors
used in this study to differentiate between interesting and neutral or less-interesting clips.

Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 1318

Moreover, the studies included here did not use standard stimuli, which makes it
difficult to perform valid comparisons between the methods used and the findings. The
majority of the studies used paradigms to compare interesting vs. boring stimulations.
These studies indicate clearly that interesting information is processed differently than
boring information, although further investigation is required. This allows us to gain
better insights into the phenomenon of interest itself rather than considering interest and
lack of interest as two different states, whereby the presence of one state is necessary for
the absence of the other one. It is difficult to separate the feelings of an individual when
viewing certain stimulations, but one can control the stimulation.
Many of the studies that addressed learning content did not consider the variability
of the learning content or the impact of this content on the subjects. It is obvious that
the subjects had individual differences in learning strategies. Differences in the learning
materials should not be overlooked when studying interest. To control for such variability,
researchers may wish to control for the age of participants, examine intelligence quotients
(IQs) or emotional quotients (EQs) of the subjects, assess the individual and situational
interest of the participants, and investigate pre vs. post knowledge. Using these strategies,
one can obtain a deeper understanding of the relationship or association between the
“interestingness” of the stimulation and the physiological results obtained. Furthermore,
the length of the stimulation was not addressed in these studies. A common stimulus
length was 20 min. However, the shortest stimulus lasted for 15 s, and the longest stimulus
lasted for several sessions over 4 to 5 days. Thus, the information provided here is not
sufficient for the discussion of this factor.
4.2. Number and Age of Subjects
The ages of participants in the included studies ranged from 8 to 63 years. None of
the studies reported an effect of age on the status or feeling of interest. However, this
does not mean that such an effect is negligible. There is a need to examine the different
conceptualizations of interest and whether they are affected by age. This may be performed
by controlling for all experimental factors while allowing only changes in the participant’s
age. Moreover, the sample size is an important factor in physiological experiments because
physiological activity fluctuates and tends to vary from person to person, as well as within
the same person following exposure to different environmental factors, such as room
temperature, noise, or experimental setting in the presence of a stimulus.
All the experiments discussed above were carried out using normal subjects, with the
exception of one study, wherein the subjects had difficulty decoding written text (dyslexia).
This is likely because further investigation and validation is still required to identify and
describe the nature of interest and the methods used to detect interest before differentiating
its effects on normal vs. abnormal subjects. Nevertheless, including other subjects, such
as those with autism or depression, would broaden this research area and lead to further
insight into interest. This would benefit the above subjects and contribute positively to the
development and burgeoning of “interest” research. Further tests are required to identify
the status of subjects in terms of IQ and EQ in order to determine whether any correlations
exist between these parameters.
5. Conclusions
This review is a modest attempt to assist in the evaluation of current studies related to
interest detection using physiological sensors. To the author’s knowledge, all the studies
concerning physiological measures of interest that contain the search keywords and imply
the inclusion criteria were included. We believe that the impact of possible missing studies—
if any—would be negligible due to the inclusion of the variety of articles presented here,
which served the aim of this review. We found that interest has a wide range of definitions
due to the diversity of research fields. Interest has different levels and types; therefore,
it is beneficial in the fields of education, economics, learning of life skills, entertainment,
and others. Detecting interest using physiological sensors is advantageous because it is an

Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 1318

efficient, real-time, accurate (hard to manipulate voluntarily), less distracting, and practical
method when compared to classical self-report methods.
EEG methods used to measure physiological reflections of mental phenomena associated with interest from the frontal cortex of the brain have produced promising results. The
frontal cortex is primarily responsible for attention and higher-order functions, including
working memory, language, planning, judgement, and decision-making. However, interest
may also be detected using information collected from parietal cortex. Using ERPs to
extract the two types of P3, as well as the N140, is extensively discussed in this review.
Eye-tracking is a well-known method for the detection of the participant’s interest in
an object and is used in many applications. However, researchers have shown that this
method cannot be used separately and requires support from other types of data. This is
because environmental effects or large movements cannot be detected using eye-tracking
algorithms. Using other sensors to provide assisting features, e.g., posture was found
convenient and led to high accuracy comparable to that of EEG results. The use of multiple
modalities was proven to be efficient and improved detection accuracy.
Interest is individually variable but is a powerful determinant of attention and perhaps recall [7]. The journey to find a reliable and accurate interest detection method is no
doubt long but is highly promising and rewarding. Interest is considered by many recently
proposed research perspectives as a motivation variable and an element for accomplishment and goal achievement. The most important factor to consider is good experimental
practices, starting with the recruitment of eligible subjects, valid stimulations, and proper
data acquisition, and ending with the proper choice of analysis method, feature extraction,
as well as classification techniques. Another factor to consider is collaboration between
researchers from different fields because little is known about the phenomenon of interest.
For example, establishing a psychological hypothesis and designing the experiment with
physiological signals would strongly enhance and verify the outcome of the proposed study
and provide proper and comprehensive analysis for the phenomenon of interest from a
different perspective. Future studies could also benefit from introducing a standard dataset
to improve the integrity of the studies and enable replication if required. Furthermore, the
number of subjects should be considered when validating a study. An appropriate large
number of subjects is essential in physiological studies because of the fluctuating nature
and variability in physiological parameters. Unfortunately, the self-report approach is still
used to annotate and label the data obtained from the physiological sensors, which is then
fed to the classifiers. However, it ought to use self-report measurements along with the
physiological sensors to provide a perception of how the conscious mood is associated with
cognitive functioning and to find a more credible source of validation than self-reporting.
This may be accomplished by repeating the experiment using different subjects placed in
the same scenario, i.e., the same physiological sensors and identical experimental settings.
Alternatively, the same subjects can be tested using different valid, interesting stimulations.
Behavioral measures performed by experts are also recommended.
