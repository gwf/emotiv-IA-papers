ABSTRACT
The research presents the participatory processes implemented using Eye-track and EEG to analyse and "survey" the landscape, the
immaterial relation that determines the quality of places. If it is always feasible to measure quantities, it is more complex to bring out
data and interpretations on the values of places. This path based on the centrality of vision, it focuses on the possibility of detecting
through biosensors what attracts the eye most, but also on the effect of vision of this on man. By combining these instruments and their
data, it is possible to associate the observer's staring with the sensations he feels, thus explicitly explaining the concept of imageability
expressed by Kevin Lynch, it is possible to individuate precisely which elements of the urban space attract the observer and what kind
of status arouse in him.

1. INTRODUCTION
Every day more, landscape question becomes one of the themes
more debated in academic and political contexts. Everyone wants
to preserve landscape but it is not clear what the real subject of
their interest is.
The European Landscape Convention defines: "landscape means
an area, as perceived by people, whose character is the result of
the interaction of natural and/or human factors ...the expression

of the diversity of their shared cultural and natural heritage, and
a foundation of their identity ". The idea of landscape closely
linked to perception, to vision and to those elements that structure
the processes of identity construction.
It is possible to extend Kant’s philosophic considerations
reported in his “Critique of Judgment” (1790), where he asserts
that landscape shall not be simply judged as beautiful nor
sublime, but rather more perceived as a state of mind. It is
possible to "distinguish two styles of perception: one is pragmatic

and action-oriented, the other is aesthetic and affect-oriented"...
in a "cognitive-semiotic theory of conceptual organization and
semantic integration in general”.... "both the meaning structures
found in art and the surplus meanings of things, their
‘connotations’ are based on non-integrated structures that tend to
be integrated on higher levels of mental architecture. The
emphatic splitting of experienced situational meaning into two
mutually mapping mental spaces—a content space and an
expression space—which is characteristic of the phenomenology
of works of art and other aesthetically perceived objects, is due
to this phenomenon of unintegrated surplus structures" (Brandt,
2006).
In this regard it is possible to understand how the theme,
especially if declined in the European city, rich in stratifications
and signs, opens to reflect on how the community who lives them
can really understand their value, but also creatively participate
in protecting and enhance them (Norberg-Schulz, 1992),
exploiting also the capabilities of the new digital tools.
The research presents the participatory processes implemented
using Eye-track and EEG to analyse and "detect" the landscape,
the immaterial relation that determines the quality of places. Such
means, up to a recent past, were the prerogative of medical
disciplines because of their cost and of the lack of portability.
Today they work for marketing purposes, while their use is
innovative to understand the public space and as tools for codesigning.
The research tackles the challenge of quality survey (Bianconi
and Filippucci, 2018a): if it is always feasible to measure
quantities, it is more complex to bring out data and interpretations
on the values of places. This path is based on the centrality of
vision (Kepes and Chiaia, 1990), the possibility of detecting
through biosensors what attracts the eye most, but also the effect
of vision of this on man. By combining biosensors, it is possible
to associate the observer's staring with the sensations he feels,
thus explicitly explaining the concept of imageability expressed
by Kevin Lynch (Lynch, 1960), it is possible to individuate
precisely which elements of the urban space attract the observer
and what kind of status arouse in him.
Through this methodology with a statistical sample, it is possible
to identify on average which elements people perceive and which
sensations they cause in them. In this way, it is possible to pursue
an analysis aimed at a heuristic research for higher quality, with
people who simultaneously acquire awareness of the value of
their goods (Settis, 2014).
It is therefore possible to set up a co-planning of urban spaces,
focused on meanings and not on signs, a specific competence of
designers that will not be delegated to a sort of popular jury. The
path, however, wants to identify empirically but with a scientific
basis and a concrete analyticity in order to intervene effectively,
which are the critical issues of the environments and which are
the elements of greatest interest to valorise. From the analysis of
the results, in fact, it is possible to individuate urban space
detractors and the use and placement of urban furnishings, those
that generate a negative emotional state. The path can become a
paradigmatic example of wayfinding (Belardi and Bianconi,
2012), supported by digital instruments (Bianconi et al., 2019),
in a participatory approach in the co-design of public spaces
(Bianconi and Filippucci, 2017a). It is about educating the vision
(Arnheim, 1986), redefining the centrality of the attention, which
is the base of the care of places, but also the definition of the role
of the community in protecting and enhancing the cultural
heritage.

2. MAIN BODY
2.1 The research themes
The research project aims to innovate the approach to the design
of urban landscape and public spaces, finalized to increase human
health and wellbeing in an intersection of solutions inherent
social, cultural, digital and nature-based innovations.
In the centrality of human factor (Sanders and McCormick,
1987), new instruments and methodologies will be developed to
examine a real environment, to value the future transformations,
to identify and maximize the effects of the environment for man’s
psychophysical well-being and to valorise the impact of
interventions.
Through an interdisciplinary approach and by using new digital
tools, the research promotes a redrawing of urban spaces from a
perceptive point of view in relation with welfare, in order to
analyse strategies for the mitigation of social exclusion and
marginalization. Because space shapes our life (Sarah Williams
Goldhagen, 2017). It could have a good or a negative effect, but
it cannot be neutral and sometimes it contributes to
psychophysical illnesses. The design of these public spaces too
often is not directly addressed to citizen health (Millennium
Ecosystem Assessment, 2005) and well-being (Bechtel and
Churchman, 2002), also because there is no methodology to
analyse and evaluate the effects of the solutions, a central data to
promote a sustainable and welfare design and a participated
development of the place.
In the last 20 years the research on health determinant factors
clearly shifted the attention to the social dimension of the
individual’s life (Badland and Pearce, 2019; Byrne et al., 2014;
Carmichael, 2019; Corburn, 2004; House et al., 2007; Jackson L,
2003; Konstantinos Tzoulasa et al., 2007; Lee AC. Maheswaran
R. and Lee A.C.K., 2011; Leeuw, 1999; M.C. et al., 2018;
Schram-Bijkerk et al., 2018). Regarding the overall objective, the
proposal wants to test new design strategies, new instruments and
methodologies to examine a real environment, to value its future
transformations, to identify and maximize the effects of the
environment for man’s psychophysical well-being.

In this way, the study defines a methodology to analyse public
places impacts, in a multidisciplinary way, in health and wellbeing, surveying physical aspects of the city and the citizen
behaviour of spaces.
Contemporary cities are conditioned by the modern movement,
which pursuing an ideal of aesthetics due solely to functionalism,
it made anonymous cities (Appadurai, 1996). Very similar
buildings cannot create a figurability (Schultz, 1987), i.e. the
quality that gives a physical object a high probability of evoking
a vigorous image in every observer.
This contemporary image of the city (Fabio. Bianconi and
Filippucci, 2019) underlines rather the relation of modernization
which is typical of a widespread urban landscape, and which
becomes ever more complex until it reaches its maximum level
in the Nineteenth century, due to the conflicts inherent in its
development (Appadurai, 1996). Within the city itself, in the
wake of the victory of a business-oriented mentality, the built-up
environment has undergone a change resulting in the
multiplication of signals (Venturi et al., 1977) that imposes a
multiplicity of space-time attractors (Appleyard et al., 1966) in a
dynamic equilibria (Arnheim, 1965) that changes the face of the
city. Urban landscape (Cullen, 1961) born in the reading activity,
in the process of transforming the perceived data into patterns
and meanings (Jencks, 1969). Representation becomes a
transposition of sensible elements in intellectual synthesis, “it is
never a given space but a built space” (Panofsky, 1927), where
from every point of the space, equal constructions are possible to
be built. Identify cannot be separated from identifying:
recognisability allows the creation of a urban geography
(Larkham and Short, 2006) and a psychogeography (Coverley,
2018) to emerge where the value of the sign (Debord, 1958),
central in both perception and in the subsequent design phase,
which is substance of connections between semiology and urban
plan (Barthes, 1967) .
In this context, the public spaces represent a central paradigm of
the historic urban landscape, as places intended to condense
meanings. In particular, the public space (Francis et al., 2012;
Gehl, 2007; Gehl and Gemzøe, 2003; Gehl and Svarre, 2013;
Goheen, 1998) intended as a place where people of social groups,

various cultural and demographic, meet and enter into different
relations, a space where the public life is centred on
communication (Castells, 2008) and vision (Friedman, 1972).
The parameters (Ewing et al., 2013) that define spaces are the
legibility, the easy interpretation of the surrounding environment
(Lynch, 1984), the mystery, the opportunity to obtain additional
information through the exploration (Debord, 2006), the intimacy
and refuge, the ease of finding a shelter (Pallasmaa, 1994).
A different attention to the design can change the sense of the
place for all (Norberg Schulz, 1979), but also the attention to the
signposting and architectonic solutions of urban wayfinding
(Bechtel and Churchman, 2002; Bianconi et al., 2019; Meng and
Zhang, 2012). The idea of public space, in the ordinary usage is
completely changed compared to the past, it is the identification
of space and meeting that breaks the outskirts of the “analogue
city” theorized by Aldo Rossi (Rossi et al., 1976). For many
psychologists, the attractiveness of a public space is
commensurate with its ability to see others as well as to be seen
and to freely express themselves (Gehl, 2011). The public space
holds the image of the city (Torelli, 1997) and it wants to focus
on those aspects related to the memory of the visitors and of the
consciousness of citizens , who are the keepers of their
community’s values (Szondi and Mendelsohn, 1978).
The issue inheres the measure of perception. “Man is mainly a
visual animal, and more than the 50% of his brain neurons
respond to this sensorial incoming” (Maffei, 2007). Immaterial
data are the real theme of virtual modeling, those elements that
explain and describe in a different way what is observed
(Bianconi and Filippucci, 2017b; Filippucci et al., 2016). The
visualization of the intangible data allows to fully understanding
the environment or the observed object (Bianconi et al., 2019;
Gaulon et al., 2017; Remondino et al., 2009). The widely
discussed theme of perception (Ancona, 1970; Arnheim, 1965,
1986; Bianconi and Filippucci, 2018b; Fabio Bianconi and
Filippucci, 2019; Filippucci, 2013; Gibson, 2014; Gogel and
Tietz, 1977; Gregory, 1998; Ramachandran, 1990) thus finds a
new life in the field of neuroscience (Pinotti and Lucignani,
2007), which are linked to the logics of neuro-marketing (Berčík
et al., 2016; Giraldi et al., 2017; Jordao et al., 2017; Lahmiri,
2018; Oliveira, 2014; Oliveira et al., 2014; Oliviera and Giraldi,
2017; Onay, 2016; Sloan, 2015) used also for urban landscape
and public space.
Data are the petroleum of the future, but their real value emerges
when they offer an interpretation of the reality, to understand the
future transformation. As the MIT professor Alex Pentland
affirms, “Moving to a data-driven society will be a challenge. In
a world of unlimited data, even the scientific method as we
typically use it no longer works: there are so many potential
connections that our standard statistical tools often generate
nonsense results. The standard scientific approach gives us good
results when the hypothesis is clear and the data are designed to
answer the question. But in the messy complexity of large-scale
social systems, there are often thousands of reasonable
hypotheses; it is impossible to tune the data to all of them at once.
Therefore, in this new era, we will need to manage our society in
a new way. We have to begin testing connections in the real world
far earlier and more frequently than we ever have before. We
need to construct "living labs" in which we can test our ideas for
building data-driven societies” (Pentland, 2013) .
The study of human brain responses to sensations and stimuli
stands as fundamental to select data as a function of their impact.
It is a "cognitive heuristic" based on simple, rapid, but very
effective schemes for evaluating transformation processes of data
in information and the information itself in partial knowledge , to
address complex situations through simpler problems (Marewski
et al., 2010).

It is significant to note how the user becomes the leading actor,
transcribed in the myth of the "consumer-actor" (Codeluppi,
2011), in the creation and dissemination of data, producing an
enormous amount of information that becomes significant of
trends and developments. If objects are smart and able to
communicate, even the individual, in his activities, assumes the
paradox of being subject and object of interest, the one who
produces data that allows him to describe it, fundamental for
marketing. The interest in this production of information is
increasingly leading to move from the Internet of Things to the
Internet of People (Berrocal et al., 2015; Conti et al., 2017, 2012;
Florido et al., 2018; Rajah and Lim, 2018). It is a consequential
condition for a greater convergence between the virtual world
and the physical environment (Conti et al., 2012), where the
digital does not lead to dreamlike engulfment of machines on
man, but vice versa is directed more and more to put the person
at the center (Anderson, 2002; Anderson et al., 2006; Buchanan,
2002; Cakir, 2011; Srivastava et al., 2012).

Earth images with the RGB attribute.
2.2 Means and Methods
The innovative aspects that characterize the research are
identifiable in the developed digital path. The relation between
the psychology of vision and the representation, the analysis of
the citizen behaviour in the public space, is develop using
advanced digital tools and biosensors such as eye-tracking. This
allows analysing analytically and scientifically the essential
elements that impact on image and memory. It becomes essential
and innovative, because the data connected with the Neuroheadset results, which guarantee to understand which part of the
cerebral cortex is impacted by certain signals and in certain
environments, giving analyses that can innovate the design
criteria. The eye-track is an instrument composed of two
cameras, one framing the observer's eye while the other records
the surrounding environment. After a calibration and through an
algorithm, it is possible to associate both the pupil’s movements

and where it stares the environment. In this way, it is possible to
record which elements the observer looks at and where he focuses
most. It allows identifying in an objective way what are the most
perceived elements in a given environment, and which
consequently characterize it (Crosby and Hermens, 2018;
Dufresne et al., 2017; Q. Li et al., 2016; Pieters and Warlop,
1999; Santos et al., 2015, 2015; Schiessl et al., 2003; Weichbroth
et al., 2016).
The EEG helmet is a device that through electrodes records in a
non-invasive way 14 channels (AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1,
O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, AF4) of the human brain and through
an algorithm, it transforms them into cognitive states in real time
(Kim et al., 2018). This is functional to the analysis of the
behaviours (Aspinall et al., 2015; Berka et al., 2004, n.d.; Boutani
et al., n.d.; Chynal et al., 2016; Gevins et al., n.d.; Hunter et al.,
n.d.; Itil et al., n.d.; Mavros et al., 2012; Sharma et al., 2017;
Yadava et al., 2017). In fact, the raw data collected concerning
brain impulses are interpreted by algorithms related to the EEG
helmets and transformed into six cognitive states: valence,
arousal, stress, meditation, focus, engagement (Badcock et al.,
2015, 2013; Kotowski et al., 2018).
In the developed path, the combined use of the data was obtained
through the criteria inherent in the circumplex model (Jonathan
Posner, James A. Russell, 2008), an interpretative model updated
over the years (Jonathan Posner, James A. Russell, 2008;
Wioleta, 2013) which allows tracing back to emotions using only
the cognitive states of valence and arousal (Yik, Russell and
Steiger, 2011). With the valence value as first polar coordinate
and the arousal value as second polar coordinate, it is possible to
obtain a point within the circumplex model that represents the
emotion of the observer. These points are associated with a
unique color vector for each combination, transcribed in the RGB
color space.
At the base of the reflection is the data fusion (B. Li et al., 2016)
that allows us to read what man is attracted from and what the
effects of perception on man are. In addition to the EEG data, the
geographical position in real time is acquired simultaneously at a
regular interval of one second. Thanks to the timestamp, it was
possible to synchronize the GPS and the EEG data.
The experimental path leads to gathering data on the position and
cognitive states of several testers. It is therefore necessary to find
a way to compare the emotions of the different testers based on
the spatial position. Through an algorithm developed in the
Grasshopper visual script language for the Nurbs environment of
Rhinoceros, it is possible to import the csv data of the
experiments containing synchronized coordinates and EEG data,
to identify in which positions the observations were taken from
contiguous and comparable points. The plan referred to the space
intakes was then subdivided into a grid with a pitch of 6m x 6m,
correlated to the data uncertainty in the hypothesis that the
subject moves with a speed of 1 meter per second. The algorithm
developed then identifies which experiments are comparable and
it calculates the average of the EEG and GPS values belonging to
the same cell. In this way, we obtain the average emotion of the
observers in space, represented by the data and the color of the
circumplex model.
The representation of the data is possible using as a basis a mesh
of the territory (DEM) object of analysis. The mesh was obtained
through a photo-modeling process starting from the digital data
of Google Earth, selected with a route of extraction of highresolution photograms and reconstructed with specific software
for the construction of models from photos in particular using
(Agisoft Metashape). Juxtaposed to the mesh of the basic model
is a vertex value consisting of a numerical attribute of the RGB
color and therefore an expression of the circumplex model.

Finally, the faces of the mesh are colored by interpolating the
vertex colors.
The representation thus obtained has a twofold objective: to store
instrumental data and to represent them in an easily
understandable way. The model, applied to the surveyed forms
of the territory, colored with uniformity in the case of univocal
emotions, it presents differences in correspondence with
something that varies the sensations. On these sites, it is then
possible to go on to further investigations, also using the data
deriving from the data sampling and the done survey path with
the EEGs, and simultaneously using the eye-trackers. These tools
collect the coordinates on the projection plane related to fixation
and gaze. It is then a matter of having further data, aligned with
the timestamp, to highlight which are the mostly seen areas,
which therefore seem to be the cause of the variation of the
sensations. In this way, the various testers are implicit creators of
a codesign path, as they highlight the key points of the landscape.

2.3 The case study
The case study is the Piazza Nuova in the Fontivegge area in
Perugia, connected to the national public investment in the rail
station area (more than 16 million of euros). This wants to
support with innovation and research the development of
deprived neighbourhoods, foster equitable access for all public
spaces, enhance their quality and use, promote sustainable urban
mobility patterns, reducing health-related environmental burdens
in socially.

Figure 6 – Some frames of the recordings with Eye-Tracker in
the current square. Circled in blue where the gaze rests, and in
red the gaze rapid movement.
It is an area interpreted as dangerous, due to the failure to
complete the architectural intervention, and on the other hand, to
the same design choices of the famous architect Aldo Rossi
(Rossi and Huet, 1984), linked to an idea of metaphysical
architecture and stereometric forms marked by the rhythm of
openings. It is then an area at the center of the debate, where one
wonders if safety issues are linked to design choices.
Data acquisition took place by using EEG Emotiv Epoc +, EyeTrack Pupil and, for the geographical coordinates, a Samsung
Gear S3.
There were 50 registrations and observers aged between 29 and
65, of whom 26 women and 24 men.
The experimentation began on the west side of Piazza del Bacio,
after which the observer was free to roam inside it and in the
surrounding areas.
The acquired EEG RAW data were processed by Emotiv PRO
and exported in CSV format with the average valence and arousal
metrics in regular intervals of 10 second. To synchronize them
with the coordinates recorded every second, the average value
was calculated every 10 seconds. In this way, each data is
synchronized according to the timestamp at intervals of 10
second.
From the results, it emerges that the areas near the arcades, which
partially surround the square, generate a strong feeling of "alert"
in the test participants. Furthermore, the entrance areas to the
square are polar, this are two: northward through a green area,
and southward by two large staircases, of which the one towards
the station is more alerting, probably being known to testers the
habit of dwelling on such stairs from unreliable subjects. As
evidenced by the eye tracking, the arcades are characterized by

to the sense of insecurity. A slight slope, which implicitly
characterizes an effort in the journey on one way and on the other
it imposes an acceleration, marks the built square. This contrasts
with the green area, which for the very qualities of its natural
essence and probably because it is open and controllable, arouses
relaxation and calm, emotions fragmented by a more turbulent
excitement in the tree-screened borders. Analyzing data, it is
possible to see the emotional state in the area, characterized by
29% of negative state, an important percentual considering the
survey activity and a comparison with other experiences
(Bianconi & Filippucci, 2019b).

The integration of different instruments, to be innovate in the
project also by improving their performances, may lead to a
combined analysis understandable only if the data are analysed
through an interdisciplinary reading. The proposal then has the
aim of defining methodologies for collecting data. It also wants
to define interdisciplinary interpretative criteria to understand
what is analysed, arriving to considerations of synthesis to be
poured into the metaprojective field, to then test possible
improvement solutions in the concerned areas and empirically
analyse their impact.
With an interdisciplinary approach, through new devices, it is
possible to analyse what man sees, what emotion he feels, how
the environment influences his emotional state implicitly, which
are the places and the conditions that favour welfare.
Moreover, studying the public spaces means promoting a vision
centred on man that involves the active involvement of the users,
taking into account the specificity of the contexts in which they
act as they "really are" and not as they "should be". The codesign
is implicated in these studies, the discipline deals with the human
factor in order to study how man acts in his environment, in order
to promote a truly inclusive design aimed at making people who
live in it feel at home, feeling the spaces as their own.
The digital then becomes a real tool of Computer Aids Design,
with digital data used not only to show the visible but also to
make visible what is implicit in the relation between man and the
environment. It is then a useful methodology to verify
operationally the sense of places, which really and analytically
focuses on emotions and meanings, and which is definable as a
concrete methodology to analyze not only the territory and the
environment, but also the landscape, intended as a result of the
path of perception.
