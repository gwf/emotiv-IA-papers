The images for Figures 1 and 2 are incorrectly switched with
each other, and the images for Figures 6 and 7 are incorrectly
switched with each other. The figure legends appear in the correct
order. Please see the correct figures here.

Figure 6. System response timings. The system responds to the
sinusoid signal peak (time 0). The red color (dt1) indicates minimal
observed delay; the blue color (dt2) indicates jitter. Galaxy Note running
Android 4.0.1, 60 Hz AMOLED screen, dt1 = 125ms, dt2 = 16ms; Nexus
7 running Android 4.1.1, 60 Hz IPS LCD screen, dt1 = 85ms, dt2 = 26ms;
MacbookPro, LCD screen (60 Hz), dt1 = 80ms, dt2 = 26ms.

Figure 2. Overview of the layered architecture of the SBS2
framework. Data from the connected EEG hardware are acquired and
extracted by specific adapters and all subsequent processing is
hardware agnostic. The empty boxes indicate the extendability of the
architecture allowing additional hardware devices for data acquisition
and additional processing methods.

Figure 7. Measured sampling frequency, including measurement resolution for three random Emotiv EEG devices, 10 6
10min recordings for each. All measured rates, including uncertainty, are between 127.8828Hz and 127.8841Hz, which corresponds to
.99908 and .99909 of nominal 128Hz. The measurements were
performed with 1ms resolution (2ms accuracy) on 76800 EEG packets.
All tests were performed at normal temperature on a single day. We can
note consistent results within and across devices.
