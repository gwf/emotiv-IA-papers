Abstract‚Äî Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) require realtime feature extraction for translating input EEG signals
recorded from a subject into an output command or decision.
Owing to the inherent difficulties in EEG signal processing and
neural decoding, many of the feature extraction algorithms are
complex and computationally demanding. Presently, software
does exist to perform real-time feature extraction and
classification of EEG signals. However, the requirement of a
personal computer is a major obstacle in bringing these
technologies to the home and mobile user affording ease of use.
We present the FPGA design and novel architecture of a
generalized platform that provides a set of predefined features
and preprocessing steps that can be configured by a user for BCI
applications. The preprocessing steps include power line noise
cancellation and baseline removal while the feature set includes
a combination of linear and nonlinear, univariate and bivariate
measures commonly utilized in BCIs. We provide a comparison
of our results with software and also validate the platform by
implementing a seizure detection algorithm on a standard
dataset and obtained a classification accuracy of over 96%. A
gradual transition of BCI systems to hardware would prove
beneficial in terms of compactness, power consumption and
much faster response to stimuli.

I. INTRODUCTION
Research into brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) has been
carried out over several decades as a means of enabling
persons suffering from severe neuromuscular disabilities
interact with their environment, have more autonomy and
enjoy improved quality of life. BCIs typically consist of a
signal acquisition front end, where, for instance, neuroelectric
or haemodynamic activity of the brain is recorded, a
preprocessing and feature extraction stage followed by a final
classification stage connected to an output device. Present day
BCIs include brain-controlled wheelchairs, spelling and
communication devices, cursor control applications and
robotic arm control systems which permit the brain to perform
tasks bypassing conventional physiological output pathways.
Although initially envisioned for the benefit of patients
suffering from ‚Äúlocked-in syndrome‚Äù due to spinal cord injury,
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), brain stem stroke etc.,
present day BCIs also target people who retain significant
neuromuscular capabilities as a novel means of providing
gaming and entertainment experience.
Despite the amount of research conducted in this field,
many promising systems still remained confined to research

laboratories with studies investigating their long term use for
patients who have most need of them just beginning [1]. One
of the reasons for this delay in bringing BCIs to the home user
has been the need for a bulky personal computer performing
the analysis of brain signals and translation into output
commands. Hence, there has been growing interest in
developing BCIs on mobile platforms [2]. We present a
generalized preprocessing and feature extraction platform for
EEG signals on FPGA where features to be computed can be
selected by a user. While in a typical BCI system only the
initial stages of signal acquisition and amplification would be
performed in hardware and the remaining ones (artefact
suppression, feature extraction and translation) implemented
in software, shifting this hardware-software interface even
further would afford lower power consumption, greater
compactness and parallel feature computation.
II. LITERATURE REVIEW
Complete BCI implementation on FPGA has been quite a
recent concept. In 2010, Shyu et al. [3] published their work
of a phase-encoded Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential
(SSVEP) BCI multimedia control system and claim that, ‚Äúthis
BCI system, to the authors' best knowledge, is the first design
of a low-cost FPGA-based BCI.‚Äù The design essentially
features an analog front end, an SSVEP processing module on
FPGA and a wireless link to a multimedia device which also
functions as a means to provide immediate feedback to the
user. Although 3 electrodes are used to acquire EEG signals,
the channels are combined at the pre-amplifier stage and the
FPGA module only processes a single EEG signal. Shyu et al.
[4] developed an SSVEP based BCI enabling a user to control
the attitude of a hospital bed. An accuracy of 92.5% was
achieved with an architecture very similar to the one used for
the multimedia device controller. Both systems were
developed using an Altera Cyclone EPC2C20Q FPGA.
Khurana et al. [2] developed an FPGA-based real-time
P300 spelling device to detect letters and digits on a 6x6 grid
utilizing 7 EEG channels corresponding to electrode locations
Cz, C3, C4, Pz, P3, P4 and Oz. They obtained a classification
accuracy of 65.37% when 2 rounds of data per character was
used. The system was designed with 3 MicroBlaze processors
using a Spartan 3E FPGA. Lin and Huang [6] implemented a
BCI system for controlling an electric wheelchair. They
captured 2-channel EEG signals using NeuroSky ASICs
which were transmitted to an FPGA-based controller via a
Bluetooth link. A winking signal and an ùõº rhythm were
processed to determine direction and motion of the

wheelchair. The system was implemented on a Spartan FPGA
with a XC3S500E-PQ208 chip.
There has also been considerable interest in developing
energy efficient biomedical processors and System on Chip
(SoC) architectures suitable for long term signal monitoring
and alarm triggering. Kwong and Chandrakasan [5]
developed a low power biomedical signal processing platform
featuring a 16-bit microcontroller, SRAM and accelerators.
The SoC is programmable and capable of running different
types of algorithms in an energy efficient manner for long
term monitoring. Sridhara et al. [7] developed an ultralow
power embedded processor platform chip for medical signal
processing. The processor comprises of an FFT, SRAM and
DC-DC converter. They demonstrate the functionality of the
SoC by implementing a seizure detection algorithm which
utilizes band energies for threshold calculation. Verma et al.
[8] developed a low-power SoC for continuous EEG
monitoring and seizure onset detection. Band energies in 7
frequency bands are computed using a bank of bandpass
filters and a user may wear up to 18 channels. Classification
was performed on a separate processing platforms.
Most of the existing BCI implementations on FPGA
process just a few channels of EEG recordings whereas a
typical EEG headcap would have between 14-256 electrode
locations. Also, due to inherent complexities in EEG signal
processing, several applications that have shown promise
require multiple types of features to be computed
simultaneously (e.g. [9]). Currently, on-chip implementations
of medical signal processors are only capable of extracting a
single type of feature at a time. Moreover, each signal requires
its own processing module. To overcome some of these
drawbacks we present the FPGA implementation of a
platform for EEG signal analysis capable of computing
multiple types of features in realtime. We exploit the low
bandwidth of scalp EEG signals to develop an architecture
that reuses each basic feature extraction module through
multiplexing. Section III of this paper details the overall
architecture of the platform and the preprocessing stage, while
Section IV describes the features we provide. Thereafter we
provide a comparison of the results we obtained with existing
software using recordings from the EMOTIV neuroheadset.
We conclude with Section VI noting several possible future
directions of work.
III. PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE
We utilize a multirate design in our system and partition the
platform into two subsystems with a set of shared memories
functioning as the interface between them. The first
subsystem comprises of a bank of highpass and notch filters.
Each digitized 24-bit EEG signal is filtered and read into ùëõ
separate shared memories (ùëÄùëñ ). The first subsystem runs at
the sampling frequency ùëìùë† of the signal acquisition device.
Once all sample points corresponding to a predefined epoch
of EEG have been read in, data is read off from each of the
shared memories in turn and fed into the feature extractors
(FE) which belong to the second subsystem. This is run at a
conventional FPGA clock frequency of 50 MHz. The limited
bandwidth of the EEG signals enables us to extract features

Figure 1: Platform architecture ( Mi - Shared Memory, FE - Feature
Extractor )

from each of the ùëõ epochs serially (reusing an FE) before the
next new EEG sample is read into the memory bank after 1/ùëìùë†
s. In this design we utilize three multiplexers to feed in the
EEG samples into the FEs. The first one, first allows the EEG
epoch recorded from the first electrode, stored in ùëÄ1 , to pass
through whichever FEs have been enabled. Likewise, this is
repeated for all the other (ùëõ ‚àí 1) single EEG epochs. The
other two multiplexers serve to feed in any combination of
two single EEG epochs into the bivariate FEs. If the FE
modules require a large number of clock cycles for
computation or signals from a large number of electrode
positions are recorded, a multiple set of FEs could be utilized
in parallel. A single set of FEs is sufficient for the set of
measures we propose in this system. The architecture of the
system is illustrated in Figure 1 and is capable of calculating
multiple types of features simultaneously in realtime for nonoverlapping epochs as are typically required in asynchronous
BCI applications. Typically the entire set of features in the
platform would not be required at a time and a user has the
ability to select whichever FEs that need to be activated by an
enable signal.
EEG signal processing frequently involves the calculation
of multivariate features, hence we provide 2 bivariate
measures in our design. Overall, the proposed system makes
more efficient use of hardware by reusing resources instead
of using a set of FEs for each channel. The set of features we
provide include,

diagram in Figure 1.

Figure 2 : Decomposition of 2s EEG epoch with Harr wavelet

A. Preprocessing Stage
Scalp EEG recordings in the microvolt range are
susceptible to a number of internal and external sources of
contamination. These include muscle noise, ocular artefacts,
power line noise, baseline wander and motion artefacts. In our
design, we utilize a set of 0.5 Hz highpass and 50 Hz notch
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters to eliminate baseline
drift and power line interference. Each of the ùëõ channels of
EEG pass through two separate 64-tap FIRs having 16-bit
coefficients with quantization selected to maximize dynamic
range. A window-based method was used to design both
filters.
IV. FEATURE EXTRACTION
A. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)
Joint time-frequency analysis has been an invaluable tool
in the study of non-stationary EEG signals. Temporal and
spatial resolution in conventional spectrum analysis
techniques are highly dependent on EEG segment length,
model order and other parameters. Wavelet decomposition
provides a time-frequency representation of EEG signals as a
solution. The DWT has been used in applications such as the
detection of seizures [10] and feature extraction based on
Event Related Potentials [11].
We apply the DWT on each of the non-overlapping epochs
of EEG data and perform 4-level decomposition into 5
frequency sub-bands. Haar and Daubechies (db4 and db6)
mother wavelets are used with a lifting-based structure.
Classically, the WT is performed using a bank of highpass and
lowpass filters. The lifting scheme provides an alternate, more
efficient implementation of extracting DWT coefficients.
Lifting steps for the three wavelets are indicated below.
Let ùë• = {ùë•ùëô | ùëô ‚àà Œñ} be the EEG segment. The lowpass filter
output is the sequence ùë† = {ùë†ùëô | ùëô ‚àà Œñ} while the highpass
filter output is ùëë = {ùëëùëô | ùëô ‚àà Œñ}. The intermediate sequences
computed during lifting are indicated by ùë† (ùëñ) and ùëë (ùëñ) .

The lifting scheme is implemented on FPGA as one of the
feature extraction blocks and it will be capable of performing
Discrete Wavelet Transform. Figure 2 illustrates the first three
detail components of a four level decomposition using Harr
wavelet.
B. Power Spectral Density (PSD)
Power spectral density of EEG signals has been utilized in
the detection of seizures [12], diagnosis of depression [13],
motor imagery based BCIs [14] and several other
applications. The Welch method [15] is a non-parametric
approach to estimate PSD of a time series using modified
periodograms. In this design, we split each epoch of EEG
samples into smaller sized fixed windows ùë•ùëñ [ùëõ] with 50%
overlap and a final circular overlap as proposed in [16]. Each
segment is multiplied with a Hamming window ùë§[ùëõ] and its
FFT is computed to yield the ùëñ ùë°‚Ñé modified periodogram,

EEG samples are read from a shared memory and are
multiplied by the coefficients of the Hamming window which
are stored in a ROM. A separate address generator module is

Figure 4 : A 2s EEG epoch and its positive zero crossing histogram

used to generate the correct indices of each of the windows.
The modified EEG window samples are then scaled and fed
to an FFT module and their outputs are stored in separate
memories. While the FFT output of the final modified
window is valid, the values of all other stored periodograms
are read off from memory, added and multiplied by a scaling
term to yield the final PSD estimate. FPGA and MATLAB
estimates of an epoch of EEG are depicted in Figure 3 (log
values have been plotted for convenience).
C. Band Energies
An EEG signal can typically be decomposed into 5 separate
frequency bands: ùõø (0.5-4 Hz), ùúÉ (4-8 Hz), ùõº (8-12 Hz), ùõΩ
(12-30 Hz) and ùõæ (30-60 Hz). EEG band energies have been
studied in numerous applications ranging from seizure
detection and motor imagery identification to on-screen
primitive shape classification [17].
Energy values of the 5 frequency bands are calculated by
first computing the FFT of each EEG epoch and then
summing the squares of the spectral components in each of
the bands using separate accumulators. Energy of the ùõæ band
is calculated for the frequency range 30-45 Hz.
D. Correlation
Correlation measures the similarity between two EEG
epochs. Cross-correlation refers to the correlation between
two completely different EEG signals and the accompanying
plot is known as a ‚Äúcorrelogram‚Äù. Siuly and Li [18] used
statistical features based on cross-correlation for motor
imagery classification using a Least Square Support Vector
Machine (LSSVM) and achieved an accuracy of 95.72%.
Let ùë•[ùëõ] and ùë¶[ùëõ] be the 2 EEG epochs, each having
ùëÅ samples. The ùëöùë°‚Ñé coefficient (ùëöùë°‚Ñé lag) of the crosscorrelation is given by,
ùëÖ[ùëö] = ‚àëùëÅ‚àí|ùëö|‚àí1
ùë•[ùëñ]ùë¶[ùëñ ‚àí ùëö]
ùëñ=0

(7)

ùëö = ‚àí(ùëÅ ‚àí 1), ‚àí(ùëÅ ‚àí 2), ‚Ä¶ ,0,1,2, ‚Ä¶ , (ùëÅ ‚àí 2), (ùëÅ ‚àí 1)

In feature extractor block implementation 20 correlation
coefficients are calculated for two different EEG epochs. The
architecture is designed in a way that it can be extended easily.
Each correlation coefficient is computed in parallel.
Architecture is similar to a set of parallel FIR filters, while
samples of ùë•[ùëõ] are used as filter coefficients and ùë¶[ùëõ] being
the signal that is filtered.
E. Zero Crossing Histogram
Zero crossing intervals of scalp EEG signals have been
analyzed in the past and has been demonstrated to yield good
results in detecting probable Alzeimer's disease and Vascular
dementia [19], predicting seizures [20] and characterizing
sleep spindles [21]. The zero crossing histogram is more
robust in the presence of contaminating artefacts and is a
convenient means of extracting dynamical information about
the brain. Here, we provide a single-sample bin positive zero
crossing histogram (i.e. number of samples between two
successive points during which the signal crosses from
negative to positive). A user may concatenate adjacent bins to
create larger bins or variable bin sizes at a latter stage as may
be required.
The module utilizes simple logic to detect a positive zero
crossing by comparing each sample and its predecessor to
zero. If a positive sample is detected along with a preceding
negative one, a counter is incremented until the next zero
crossing occurs, at which point the counter is reset. At this
instant, the last value held by the counter is utilized to
increment the corresponding bin of the histogram which is
stored in memory. After detecting all crossing in the EEG
epoch, the values are read out and the memory is reset to
contain all zeros. An example histogram for a 2s epoch of
recorded EEG is shown in Figure 4.
F. Autoregressive (AR) Coefficients
Autoregressive modelling is an alternative to conventional
Fourier-based methods for representing frequency
information of a signal. In AR modelling the signal being
modelled is considered as the output of an Infinite Impulse
Response (IIR) filter when the input to this filter is white
noise. In most of the applications the IIR filter coefficients are
used as feature vectors. Anderson et al. [22] used multivariate
AR models to discriminate between mental tasks of a human

140

subject. Pfurtscheller et al. [23] distinguished right and left
motor imagery EEG using adaptive AR parameters to control
an on-screen cursor.
We compute AR coefficients for each EEG epoch. The
order of an AR model should be increased proportional to the
sampling frequency [24]. In our approach, Burg's algorithm
proposed in [25] is used to estimate AR coefficients for a
model of order 6. Each iteration of the Burg‚Äôs algorithm is
implemented as a separate module and cascaded to compute
6 AR coefficients.
According to the Burg‚Äôs algorithm ùëìùëö (ùëõ) and ùëèùëö (ùëõ) are
the forward and backward errors of order ùëö related to an EEG
epoch ùë•(ùëõ). Let the AR coefficients are indicated by the
symbols ùëé1,1 , ùëé2,2 , ‚Ä¶ , ùëéùëö,ùëö . For an intermediate stage ùëü of the
algorithm, the inputs are the forward and backward errors of
the previous stage ( ùëìùëü‚àí1 (ùëõ) and ùëèùëü‚àí1 (ùëõ)). The outputs of the
ùëü ùë°‚Ñé stage are the new set of forward and backward
errors ùëìùëü (ùëõ) , ùëèùëü (ùëõ) and ùëé1,1 , ùëé2,2 , ‚Ä¶ , ùëéùëü,ùëü coefficients. The
nature of the algorithm makes the current stage depend on the
previous stage outputs. Hence a cascaded system is suggested
for the implementation.
G. Phase Synchronization
Extensive research has been pursued over the past several
years into the analysis of EEG signals (both intracranial and
scalp EEG) for developing algorithms to automatically detect
and predict epileptic seizures. Algorithms that use bivariate or
multivariate measures have been investigated in this
particular field as they have shown to yield superior
performance to univariate measures which lack spatial
specificity. Phase synchronization has been one such measure
that has yielded promising classification results [26], [27].
Phase synchronization is calculated to quantify the
instantaneous phase lock between 2 EEG channels separated
in space. The phase locking between 2 EEG signals ùëâùëú and ùëâ1
is estimated by first applying the Hilbert Transform to the
signals to compute their real and imaginary components. The
Hilbert Transform is approximated by a 64-tap FIR filter. The
instantaneous phases of the 2 channels are then computed to
yield ùúôùëò ,
ùúôùëò = arctan

ùêºùëö{ùëâùëò }
ùëÖùëí{ùëâùëò }

; ùëò = 0,1

(8)

The phase difference is then obtained as Œîùúô = ùúô1 ‚àí ùúô0 . The
phase locking value (PLV) between the 2 channels is then
calculated as,
1

ùëÅ‚àí1

ùëÉùêøùëâ = ‚àö[‚àëùëÅ‚àí1
ùëñ=0 sin(Œîùúôùëñ )] + [‚àëùëñ=0 cos(Œîùúôùëñ )]
ùëÅ

(9)

The module makes use of 4 CORDIC blocks to calculate 4quadrant arctan, sine, cosine and square roots of the incoming
data points to obtain PLV for each EEG epoch in real time.
The sine and cosine values of the phase differences are
summed using 2 separate accumulators whose final output
corresponding to all samples in the epoch is fed into the
square root CORDIC block.

V. RESULTS
The platform was implemented on a Virtex 7 FPGA. We
utilized the 14-channel EMOTIV neuroheadeset with a
sampling frequency of 128 Hz for testing. For testing out each
individual FE block, we used a 1 hour long single channel
recording. This signal was then split into 1800 epochs of 2s
(256 samples) duration. For each feature vector ùë•ÃÇ calculated
in hardware, we compute the corresponding vector ùë• in
MATLAB. The mean absolute error between the two
estimates which occurs due to the fixed point arithmetic on
FPGA is calculated as follows,

The error per feature vector of each epoch is obtained by
averaging and the comparison of results is shown in Table 1
along with the number of clock cycles (at 50 MHz clock
frequency) taken for computation of each feature. The
functionality of the complete multirate system was tested
separately for all EEG channels and after computing features
for the ùëõ epochs (requiring ùëõ √ó cycles per feature), over
300000 spare clock cycles remain for any further application
prior to receiving the next sample.
Secondly, we validate our platform by implementing the
seizure detection algorithm in [28]. db-4 and db-6 wavelet
coefficients are extracted for the EEG epochs using hardware
co-simulation for a dataset publicly available form University
of Bonn (a detailed description about the dataset can be found
in [29]). The best features for discriminating between the 2
classes were selected using the Mann-Whitney test at a
significance of 1%. We utilize 60% of the data for training
and use the remainder for testing on an LSSVM classifier. We
achieved an overall accuracy of 96.93% with a sensitivity of
88.43% and a specificity of 99.06% on the test dataset.
VI. CONCLUSION
The need for a bulky PC has been one of the primary
drawbacks in bringing BCIs to the home user. Consequently,
there has been a recent interest in complete hardware
implementation of these systems. However, many of the
existing FPGA based BCIs process just a limited number of
EEG channels and extract only a single type of feature. We
present the FPGA design of a generalized preprocessing and
feature extraction platform that is capable of computing
multiple features in parallel as required by a user. We evaluate
our platform twofold. Firstly, we use data recorded from the

141

2014 IEEE Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Sciences, 8 - 10 December 2014, Miri, Sarawak, Malaysia

EMOTIV neuroheadset and obtain results comparable with
software. Secondly, we utilize our platform to extract features
for a seizure detection algorithm and obtain good
classification accuracy. Future work would include pushing
the hardware interface of BCIs even further to include a set of
classification algorithms. Extending the platform to include
features commonly utilized in other biomedical signal
processing applications (e.g. R-R intervals and area of QRS
complexes in electrocardiograms) would also be another
useful contribution.
