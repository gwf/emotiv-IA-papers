Abstract
The futuristic age requires progress in handwork or even sub-machine dependency and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)
provides the necessary BCI procession. As the article suggests, it is a pathway between the signals created by a human brain
thinking and the computer, which can translate the signal transmitted into action. BCI-processed brain activity is typically
measured using EEG. Throughout this article, further intend to provide an available and up-to-date review of EEG-based BCI,
concentrating on its technical aspects. In specific, we present several essential neuroscience backgrounds that describe well
how to build an EEG-based BCI, including evaluating which signal processing, software, and hardware techniques to use.
Individuals discuss Brain-Computer Interface programs, demonstrate some existing device shortcomings, and propose some
eld’s viewpoints.
KEYWORDS: Brain-computer Interface(BCI), EEG, EEG Application, Signal Acquisition.

I. INTRODUCTION
Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a pathway between
the signals created by a human brain thinking and the
computer that transforms patterns of human activity in the
brain into patterns into commands or controls for outer
environment communication [1]. Besides that, a few other
definitions equivalent to BCI Mind Machine Interface [2],
Human-Computer Interaction [3], Neural Control Interface,
and Electronic neural interfaces [4]. They all define devices
controlled entirely by human brain waves. BCI is a
comprehensive hardware and software system to monitor
machines and various communication devices.
Nevertheless, several other descriptions stated, like [5]
in definition, the BCI as a device allows their users’
interaction and controlling systems that do not rely on the
brain’s regular periphery nerve and muscle output channels.
BCI research started in the 1970s at the California State
University [6], for which researchers identified a set of
experiments that were meant to demonstrate that direct
human-machine communication is possible. Since scientists
in research and business have invested significant effort to
turn this theory into a viable modern technology and
advancement in each of these advanced techniques and
today’s knowledge of the neuronal map has given rise to
enhancements in BCI and a massive variety of BCI
applications [7], [8]. In the last few decades, many BCI

systems [9] are developed to provide a substitute
communication platform for those who have severe muscular
dystrophy that can be seen in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
spinal cord injury, and stroke.
Through its earlier days, the researcher attempts to be
using this technique to develop medicinal aids only.
However, this technique has extended its use and has made
its way to nonmedical implementations. It is discernible that
a significant number of original papers and comments on
BCI have been written over the last 30 years.

Fig. 2: 2018 Emerging Technologies Hype Cycle Garners Insights from More Than 2,000 Technologies shows the

survey in this article [75] includes a detailed overview of the
state-of-the-art BCI framework. Firstly, it provides a brief
description of BCI-based EEG. Second, several common
BCI systems applications are reviewed. After this, it
discusses some of the new BCI programs’ challenges and
proposes alternative ways to alleviate the problems.
Another review article [7] This paper illustrates the
fields of application that could benefit from brain activity to
enhance or reach the goals. It also describes maximum
technical challenges facing the use of brain signals in
different BCI system components. Various alternatives were
also reviewed to limit and reduce their effects. An excellent
analysis narrowly addressed electroencephalogram (EEG)
control signals and their classifications [31]. In terms of both
hardware and software, the researchers evaluated state-ofthe-art BCI alternatives; nevertheless, it was notable that
applications and signal processing methods were not
considered.
Similarly, [76] Reviewed EEG-based BCI structures
during 2007-2011. However, the review did not thoroughly
represent the existing state-of-the-art and presented no areas
for future research. Alternatively, the important components
covering the full range of EEG-based BCI systems were
reviewed in [77]; even so, the number of articles reviewed
was restricted.
According to Gartner’s 2018 Hype Cycle Study on trend
technical subjects, the brain-computer interfaces are at the
trigger phase of innovation. These scientists predict which
BCI research in more than 10 years. This phenomenon is
captured in (see Fig. 2).
II. COMPONENTS OF BCI
The various components of BCI which helps in
recording the signals from brain to computer are discussed
as follows:

1) Brain Signal Acquisition: The first layer in BCI
architecture is used to acquire brain signals from the device
by using either invasive or non-invasive methods. This step
record brain signals coming from the electrodes placed over
the or in the brain. The signals are send from the frm the
brain neurons in the form of electrical spikes. Various
companies are manufacturing either clinical or consumer
graded devices to capture these electrical signals. Emotiv
Epoc by Emotiv is the first consumer device with 14
electrodes which is used to read the brain signals, otherwise
1 electrode device is also there by NeuroSky. The
information collected by these devices is send to computer
wirelessly or through Bluetooth. These companies offer
low-cost devices .
2) EEG Signal Pre-Processing: The pre-processing after
signal acquisition is to remove any noise, artifacts which are
recorded while capturing the signals of the devices. Some
of the unwanted signals include: Whenever electronic
device is mounted some inference is there. Some muscular
activity leads to EMG signals, Eye movement or blinking
cause ocular artifact. The unwanted noises present in the
EEG recording will lead to wrong conclusions and may bias
the analysis of the EEG readings. So various filter are used
to remove out the noises from the signals [79].
3) EEG Signal Extraction and Classification: Basic
functionality of classifier is to classify the results according
to predefined choices. The feature extraction helps to
identify the important features required for necessary
classification. Suitable classifiers are chosen to classify the
EEG signals. Some of the commonly used classifiers are
Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA), Support Vector
Machine (SVM), Neural Network, Fuzzy Logic system
[78].

III. BCI TECHNOLOGY BRANCHES
BCI systems can usually be classified into several
categories [11]. Fig. 2 shows the three category schemes
through dependability, brain signal recording, and operating
methods. For instance, dependability, BCI may be
categorized into either dependent or independent BCI. The
dependent BCI provides specific motor control by the user
[12], [13], Though independent BCI has no control.
Dependent BCI can help make things simpler, including
pushing a wheelchair and playing games.
However, on the other side, subjects with severe
conditions will require autonomous BCI without brain
activity. Conversely, autonomous BCIs do not demand any
degree of consumer control; this BCI type is suitable for
patients with stroke or severe disability. BCI may be
categorized in the recording system as invasive and noninvasive. Through invasive BCIs [14] microelectrode arrays
are commonly required inside the skull. Unless brain signals
are earned from electrodes outer the scalp, it is regarded as
BCI non-invasive, mostly used in non-invasive ways such as
EEG, MEG, fMRI fNIRS, and PET. Within BCI, EEG is
now the most frequent non-invasive mode, in which specific
control channels that can be evoked, comprise P300, MI,
SSVEP, ERP, and SCP [15]. Eventually, BCI will run,
whether asynchronously neither synchronously. The BCI
system is considered an asynchronous device when the user
connects with the device for a specified time. In BCI
asynchronous, often called “self-paced” [16], [17], The
subject will perform its specific tasks at a particular time, or
the machine will respond to its mental activity.

IV. BRAIN SIGNAL RECORDING METHODS

Many BCI researchers choose a non-invasive solution to
reduce the danger of surgery. EEG, iMEG, PET, ifMRI, and
fNIRS are some of the widely used non-invasive methods.
The methodology is based on several criteria [18], including
Risk, Spatial resolution, Temporal resolution, Signal-toNoise Ratio, Portability, Cost, and Characteristic. According
to its advantageous features, including higher time
resolution, affordable prices, convenient portability, and
non-invasiveness, EEG has been the most widely-used BCI
research brain imaging method.
A. Electroencephalography (EEG)
EEG is by far the most widely used method for
mensuration brain function. [19]–[23] EEG monitors voltage
produced via electrical current in brain neurons. Electrodes
on the scalp test EEG signals amplitude. EEG signals have
poor resolution due to limited electrodes. EEG electrode

locations typically follow regional 10-20 or intermediate
electrode positions. The global 10-20 system splits the scalp
across 10% and 20% parts and includes 21 electrode
positions. The American Electroencephalographic Society
standardizes the intermediate 10% electrodeposition and
separates the scalp with 10% cycles comprising 75
Electronics electrodes. There are usually fewer than 75
channel electrode, 64 channel electrodes (BCI 2000 system)
[24], [25], 32 channel electrodes (openBCI headset) [26], 14
channel electrodes (iEmotiv EPOC+ headset) [27], and one
channel electrode (iMindware headset) [28]. iTemporal EEGsignal accuracy is much higher than spatial. The electrostatic
support different rapidly, resulting in temporal resolution
across 1000 Hz[29]. EEG signal-to-noise-ratio is quite low
due to quantitative as well as emotional causes. Physical
causes include ambient noise, cortex, and other tissue cortexscalp obstruction, repeated neural stimulation. Subjective
considerations include the mental stage of the subject,
exhaustion state, and variation between various issues. EEG

Abdulwahab, Khalef & Jasim
listening equipment may be mounted in a headset., The EEG
device is mounted over the user’s head. Compared to other
brain impulses, EEG headsets are compact and much more
available for most uses. EEG signals from any specific EEG
device contain various non-overlapping frequency ranges
(alpha, beta, theta, gamma, and theta) based on a robust
intraband association with a distinct behavioral state. Every
EEG pattern includes unique brain information-related
signals [30], [31]. The degree of consciousness reflects the
experience of individuals when faced with external stimuli.
Could the Frequency band represent neural-state and
objective perception review:
• Delta rhythm (0:5-4 Hz) leads during deep sleep while less
conscious.
• Theta rhythm (4-8 Hz) represents low-aware at rest.
• Alpha signal (8-12 Hz) appears mostly in locked and fully
calm eyes, leading to ordinary consciousness.
• Beta pulse (12-30 Hz) is the dominant frequency when eyes
are open and highly receptive. The beta model represents
almost all of our everyday tasks (eat, move, speak).
B. Magnetoencephalography (MEG)
MEG is a non-invasive brain neuronal function analysis
technique. MEG plans brain function by measuring magnetic
fields produced by electric current in the brain through
information processing. The magnetic field produced is
comparatively weak. Hence MEG utilizes a sensitive
magnetometer named a SQUID [32]–[35]; SQUIDs are
mounted on the scalp to monitor neuronal activation (majorly
those closest to the magnetometer it is own).
Like the magnetic fields, MEG has several advantages,
are less disturbed than electrical current and also great
temporal resolution and proper spatial resolution even than
EEG. Besides, MEG helps identify seizure patients with
epilepsy and assists doctors in enabling surgery scheduling.
MEG has such disadvantages. It only measures paralleloriented magnetic fields (nerve cells in cerebral sulcus). It is
noticeable that MEG technology is often very costly. Also,
brain function on the surface or far below the brain surface
can not be accessed. It showed external noise sensitivity.
C. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
fMRI is a non-invasive technique used to mensuration
blood oxygen level variability through brain function [36]–
[39]. fMRI provides high spatial resolution, making it
appropriate for locating active brain regions. Nevertheless,
the fMRI time resolution varies around 1s to 2s. This also
suffers from low head motions resolution and can create
artifacts also Gives little information about their responses’
temporal dynamics. Relatively inexpensive compared to
EEG & PET. MRI is extremely noisy and moving-sensitive.
D. Optical Topography [Functional near-infrared
spectroscopy (fNIRS)]
fNIRS one of the non-invasive techniques for measuring
brain function using the flow of blood. Similar to fMRI, this
approach is also BOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent)
[40]–[42] based; however, it uses various methodologies for
data gathering. fNIRS is focused on comparative tissue
transparency to near-infrared light (NIR) [43]. Easy to

| 5
quantify and does not require radioactivity. Nevertheless, the
Poor Temporary Resolution and Time to Be Measurement (>
2–5s). The fNIRS system is a wearable head device with
sensors and a source of light. The source of light generates
NIR light straight upon the scalp, traveling through the skull.
Several other lights are reflected. However, some resurface.
Headset sensors record resurfaced light photons. Recordings
are used to show a realistic brain image.
E. Electrocorticography (ECoG)
ECoG is an extracortical invasive (partial invasive)
technique for measuring brain function. Electrodes gathering
ECoG is tied to its brain, the dura mater above (epidural), or
below (subdural) but not to the brain parenchyma itself.
ECoG offers a trade-off for low SNRs Non-invasive
recordings and lower intracortical recording risk.[44], [45].
This has better spatial accuracy and lowers surgical risk
comparatively high SNR. Therefore, ECoG has better patient
opportunities than intracortical data demonstrates the set
strategy and signals. ECoG signals are more significant than
non-invasive brain wave signals. E.g., ECoG is greater than
50 μV, and the EEG amplitude is typically less than 20 μV.
Low amplitude reduces ECoG to artifacts such as eye blink
behavior. ECoG’s bandwidth 0-500 Hz is thus considerably
higher than EEG +(0-40Hz) due to the skull’s low-pass
filtering impacts. More frequency bands are greatly affected
by functional brain areas (e.g., motor and language) and can
thus shape a more effective BCI network. But even the
disadvantages of invasive approaches like ECoG (such as
dangerous surgery and the discomfort of permanently
attached devices) inevitably limit its great real-world
implementation Examples.
V. EEG PARADIGMS (MENTAL CONTROL SIGNALS
CLASSIFICATIONS)
Relative to non-invasive technique (e.g., fNIRS, ECoG,
fMRI, MEG), EEG has some significant benefits: 1) greater
portability of the hardware at a far lower cost; 2) very high
temporal resolution (millisecond level)8; 3) EEG is
comparatively tolerant of subjecting agitation and errors, and
current signal processing methods could reduce that; 4) the
subject does not need to be revealed. EEG will thus support
topics (such as metal-containing pacemakers) with metal
implants in their body. As the most widely used signals, EEG
signals have a vast number of subclasses. Here we discuss a
formal overview of sub-class EEG signals. We separated
EEG impulses into random EEG, evoked potentials, and
desynchronization/sync related to events, as seen in Fig 2.
Evoked potentials can be divided into event-related
possibilities, and steady-state evoked potentials dependent
on external stimulus size. Each potential contains potentials
based on external stimuli, visual, auditory, and
somatosensory. The dotted quadrilaterals, such as
Intracortical, SEP, SSAEP, SSSEP, and RSAP, are not
included in this study since deep learning algorithms operate
on very few current studies. We list these signals for
completeness.

6 |

Abdulwahab, Khalef & Jasim
1. Evoked signals

Evoked signals, also called Visual Evoked Signal
(VEP), are the participant’s impulses inadvertently produced
upon receiving external stimuli. The most well-known is the
Steady-State Evoked Potentials (SSEVP) and P300. Evoked
signals rely on outer stimulation that the subject can feel
awkward, shaky, and tiring.
a)

Steady-State Evoked Potentials SSEP

Noticing a regular intervals stimulus as a flashing
picture or amplitude-modulated sound, SSEP appears.
SSEP’s important feature is that EEG pulse frequencies are
identical to relaxation frequency or harmonics. Stimulating a
fixed rate evokes SSEP by generating the same frequency
EEG response as the stimulus. SSEP can be further divided
into Visually Evoked iPotentials, Steady-iState iAuditory
Evoked Potentials, and Steady-State Somatosensory Evoked
Potentials, according to visual, auditory, and somatosensory
stimulation.
The SSVEP-based BCI requires a certain amount of
visual inputs, suggesting different commands for BCI output.
These stimuli flicker in different frequency bands from 6 to
30Hz. If a subject focus on a similar flickering cue, it
produces the same average of SSVEP as the intended flicker.
For example, if the target stimulation frequency is 15Hz, the
produced SSVEP is 15Hz. The user pays visual attention to
a target, and the BCI determines the target by testing the
SSVEP features [46]– [48].
i

b)

P300 Components

This is an EEG signal that occurs when the user is
subjected to unusual or unexpected activity after nearly 300
ms. This signal is typically generated by the “odd-ball”
model, where the consumer is asked to follow a random
series of stimuli with less frequency than the others [49]–
[51]. This extraordinary stimulus triggers the P300 EEG
signals when relevant to the subject. Again P300 needs no
subject training; however, it involves repeated stimulation
that may contribute to the subject’s tiring and
inconsistencies.
Author [50] described a different brain-computerinterface P300 framework. For robot steering, visual stimuli
consisting of 8 randomly intensified arrows are used. The
classification techniques were collected offline and tested
offline and online.
2. Spontaneous Signals

Spontaneous signals are the signals produced by the
subject without any external stimulations. Many well-known
random signs are executive motor and sensorimotor patterns,
Sluggish Cortical Potentials (SCP) [31], [52], and Nonmotor functions.
3. Motor Imagery

Moving one arm or even maybe one muscle affects the
brain function of the cortex. Preparation for motion or visual
activity [also known as motor imagery (MI)] causes
sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) oscillations in the brain motor
regions. Within a limited frequency range, boosting and the

oscillatory operation are indicated to ievent-related
synchronization i(ERS) and desynchronization (ERD). The
commonly motor vision patterns are alpha and beta brain
waves [53], [54]. Activity triggered by the left-hand and
right-hand MI is produced by C3 and C4 regions of the brain,
while the perception of foot movement comes by Cz [20]. At
the EEG, the movements of the left and right foot are almost
difficult to discern. Cortical regions must be broad enough to
generate detectable standard EEG signals [55]. The right eye,
left hand, foot cortical, and lips regions are vast and distinct.
Therefore, BCI applications can monitor the movement of
individual body limbs through imagination [80].
VI. BCI TECHNOLOGY
For every research area’s progress, it needs two items
that are powerful functionality and technological advances.
This segment briefly discusses some existing hardware and
software BCI developments. Hardware devices are used
either by invasive or non-invasive methods to capture the
signals. However, through smart algorithms, BCI software
platforms are responsible for preprocessing and analyzing
the hardware’s signals and generating the external
environment’s control commands.
Hardware Technology for EEG Signal Acquisition
Generally, EEG signal acquisition can be divided into
two key ways to transfer EEG data: portable wireless and
wireless, EEG brain signal tests using conductive gel, or
paste. However, this makes the electrode embedding process
sluggish, repeated. Note, however, which dry electrodes
required no conductive gels or pastes were suggested and
validated. Despite this performance, it is notable that this
system’s total information processing efficiency is, on
average, 30% lower than that obtained from an electrodecentered BCI using conductive gels or pastes. The wired
frame, although well-established, has several major
vulnerabilities. Connection with wires between electrodes
and segment of retrieval is often tricky as it is a timeconsuming process.
Furthermore, the restricted nature of cable regulations
restricts market independence. Wireless BCI systems were
then recognized due to their ability to solve the above
limitations. A lightweight EEG headset advantage is noninvasive. It also doesn’t hamper the user’s movement. Table
4 lists EEG service types with their specifications. The EEG
headset or product design depends on BCI tools.
VII. APPLICATION OF THE BCI STUDIES
BCI systems’ promising future has enabled the
researchers to explain brain activities to set up several BCI
systems [7]. We discuss the widely known application fields
that the BCI system has been extensively discussed and
applied: the area in which BCI applications are commonly
used as entertainment controllers [56]. Many BCI systems
are affordable, handily portable, and simple to install,
making their practical use widely for entertainment
communities [57]. The built-in and portable BCI systems for
the gaming industry are versatile and convenient, requiring

Abdulwahab, Khalef & Jasim

reduced implementation effort. While they are not as
effective as other BCI instruments used in medical fields,
they are still useful for game designers and often advertised
for entertainment [58]. Several particular systems are
connected to sensors that detect additional signals, such as
facial expressions, that can enhance entertainment. BCIs
have played an essential role in neurocomputing in brain
wave signals and computer and cognitive information
studies. Recent studies [59]–[61] have shown that network
biology approaches have been used to assess the neural
network reorganization of human learning in various ways.
These studies’ results indicate that BCI models are refined,
and neural bases and future BCI learning success are
exposed. The brainwave headset, which can gather dynamic
data with the manufacturer’s application development kit,
has already been used for the healthcare industries to make it
easier for profoundly disabled people to monitor robots
through simple motions such as turning their neck and
blinking. BCI has enabled people who lacked the physical
capacity to recover machine control and strength. A
widespread therapeutic field is integrating BCI spelling
methods, one of which is a well-known P300-based speller.
Building on the P300-based speller [62] using a BCI2000
interface [63] to enhance BCI speller positively impacts the
use of this brain-controlled spelling system non-experienced
users. BCIs subsequently led to multiple study fields. As Fig.
3 briefed., they are involved in games [64], robot control
[65], emotional interpretation [66], stress recognition [67],
sleep quality assessment, and health fields [68] such as
abnormal brain disorder detection and stroke prediction,
Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia.

1. Robot controller
The robot controller consists of a finite state automaton
direct controller, a context-based filter autonomous
controller, and a complex dynamic shared controller with
additional static regularization based on external
performance parameters. The direct controller and
autonomous controller velocities are linearly combined in
the shared controller to a final output velocity. The output
velocity from the shared controller is interpolated from
precious velocity to the new desired velocity for smooth
driving, and generalized through standardized ROS
messages for robot platform independence. Modularity is
achieved by using the ROS-infrastructure during the system
design. The discrete low throughput data of the BCI can
easily be replaced with similar data to control the robot, such
as eye-movement or speech. The controller subsystems can
be replaced with other subsystems that follow the same
interconnection, i.e., substituting the autonomous controller
with an alternative navigational assisting system for different
controller behavior
VIII. CONCLUSION
BCI is one of the essential fields concerned with brain
functions. BCI technologies are expected to impact
Everyone’s modern lives significantly. This paper survey
articles summarize the field and provide the readers with
state-of-the-art research in this field. This article
concentrates on the BCI concept. This also categorizes and
describes the brain signals acquisition tool. This also reviews
the existing BCI equipment. Nonetheless, it produces several
roadmaps for BCI’s future. Discuss current BCI proposals
