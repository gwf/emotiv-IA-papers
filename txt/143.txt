Electroencephalography (EEG) is well known
method of recording electrical brain activity with
electrodes placed along the scalp. One of the
challenging tasks in this field is the removal of
electrical signals that are not related to brain
activity.
In this paper, an algorithm for the removal of the
EEG signals corresponding to the eye blink
artifacts is presented. The presented algorithm is
based on ADJUST artifact removing tool, which
uses independent component analysis (ICA) for
signal decomposition. For every signal component
returned by the ICA algorithm, temporal-spatial
features are calculated, upon which every
independent component is classified as artifact or
non-artifact, and removed accordingly.

Introduction

Electroencephalography (EEG) is well known
technique for acquiring electrical brain activity data
[1]. Thanks to its temporal resolution and everyday
declining cost of the EEG acquisition systems (in
comparison to other brain activity acquisition
systems like Magnetoencephalography (MEG)), the
EEG is most widely distributed method of
measuring human brain functionality.
Despite all of the virtues that EEG system poses,
one of the main challenges in EEG acquisition
processing is artifact removal. Physiological artifact
activity like eye or neck movement, could
potentially lead to extreme amplitude jumps that are
5-10 times greater than the normal brain activity
measured by the EEG acquisition system. Such
amplitude disturbances in the signal can obscure
electrical brain activity of interest, leaving us with
the challenging task of neurological and

physiological activity separation. Other type of
artifacts are of a non-biological nature and are
mainly caused by the electrode high-impedance or
the electric device interferences.
Over the last decades numerus methods of nonneurological removal in the acquired EEG signal
have been developed. One of the simplest methods
is the threshold method, in which the samples with
amplitudes greater than the threshold value are
simply removed from the signal. Although this
method is very simple and fast, the significant
amount of information is lost in the remaining EEG
signal. For the EEG signals that are decomposed
into epochs, a simple averaging method over epochs
can be used. However, this procedure is limited with
the number of available averaging epochs and the
artifact frequency.
Some advanced methods of the EEG artifact
removal consist of modelling the eye blink or the
ocular movement, and removing them from the

original EEG signal. For this purpose, additional
electrooculogram (EOG) channel is placed around
eyes measuring the electrical activity of the eye
muscles [2]–[4]. This signal combined with the
propagation model of the artifact signal, can elicit a
propagated artifact signal that can be easily
subtracted from the artifact-corrupted EEG signal.
Most recent efforts in the field of artifact removal
algorithms, involve independent component analysis
(ICA) tool; a statistical tool which decomposes a
multidimensional signal into the maximally
independent components (IC) originating from
independent signal sources [5], [6]. Because of its
statistical approach and assumptions (eg. linear
mixing of ICs) a prefect signal decomposition is not
always possible. Nevertheless, the EEG signals can
be successfully decomposed with the ICA into
independent components (IC) related to the various
artifacts, which can then be subtracted from the
original EEG signal.
In this paper we propose an algorithm for the eye
blink artifact removal based on the Automatic EEG
artifact Detection based on Joint Use of Spatial and
Temporal features (ADJUST) tool. Compared to the
ADJUST, the proposed algorithm involves extra
steps, including eye blink artifact detection and
decomposition of the EEG signal into the signal
epochs containing artifact and nearby clean brain
activity samples. The extracted epochs are then
decomposed with the ICA into ICs which have been
classified into artifact and non-artifact classes, based
on their spatial-temporal features. Guided with the
ICA limitations stated before, the iterative ICA, the
spatial-temporal features calculation and the IC
classification process is implemented in the
proposed algorithm, ensuring better artifact
rejection.

words, but were also asked to make an eye blink
whenever they hear the target event.
The EEG measurements have been collected with 2
different EEG data acquisition systems the Emotiv
Epoc+ and the Brain Products V-Amp. The Emotiv
Epoc+ [8] is an accessible and cheap EEG
acquisition system, with 14 EEG signal electrodes,
one reference, one ground electrode (Fig. 1), and
maximal sampling frequency of 128 Hz. V-Amp [9]
on the other hand is high-quality device for the EEG
acquisition, with 16 EEG electrodes, one reference,
one ground electrode, 24-bit AD converter, and 512
Hz sampling frequency. The main advantage of the
V-Amp system over the Emotiv Epoc+ system,
beside the technical specifications, is the ability of
setting custom electrode configuration (Fig. 2).

The acquisition system of the EEG

Datasets used for the development and analysis of
the proposed artifacts removing algorithm, have
been collected from the candidates participating in a
typical auditory event-related potential paradigm.
The experiment is designed in OpenVibe [7] and
consists of six different words that are randomly
played on the speaker. One of the events represents
the target event, while the other events are labelled
as non-targets. For the purpose of this paper, the
candidates have not just focused on the played

random vector into components which are
statistically as independent from each other as
possible. For our particular problem, the ICA
algorithm will decompose N-dimensional EEG
signal into N ICs, which are product of the N
independent brain activity sources [5], [6]. Beside
the ICs, a mixing matrix A is returned satisfying the
following equation:

EEG = A ∗ IC

The ADJUST algorithm

The ADJUST [10] is a plugin tool for EEGLAB
software [11] and is used for the removal of EEG
artifacts from the EEG datasets. The main advantage
of the ADJUST algorithm is the ability to
automatically decompose a set of multidimensional
EEG signals into ICs, classifying them as artifacts
and non-artifacts and removing artifact related ICs
without any user intervention or supervision. The
ADJUST algorithm can distinguish 4 different EEG
artifacts corresponding to the: eye blink (EB),
vertical eye movement (VEM), horizontal eye
movement (HEM) and generic discontinuities (GD),
related to the problems with a EEG data acquisition
system.
As stated in the introduction, only removal of the
eye blink artifacts will be a subject of this research.
Fig 3. shows a block diagram of the new enhanced
algorithm for the removal of eye blink artifacts
based on the ADJUST algorithm. Blocks marked
with the green color are original ADJUST functions
for the decomposition, temporal and spatial feature
calculation and classification, which have been
explained in continuation of this section.
3.1 The independent component analysis
The ICA algorithm is a statistical method for
decomposition of the observed multidimensional

(1)

where EEG is measured N-dimensional EEG signal,
and IC is N-dimensional vector of brain source
independent components.
Applying the principal component analysis (PCA)
on data before execution of the ICA algorithm, the
number of desired ICs is reduced, simplifying the
component extraction process.
3.2 Spatial and temporal classification features
For discrimination between the eye blink artifacts
and the non-artifact, ICs spatial and temporal
features of independent components are calculated
based on the ICA outputs.

3.2.1

Spatial average difference

By their nature, the eye blink arifacts induce a high
voltage jumps in frontal area of the brain. Thus in
order to distinguish artifacts from non-artifact a
measure is introduced, which emphasizes amplitude
jumps of EEG signal in the frontal areas, and
supressing the jumps on electrodes covering the
posteriori region of the brain. Accordingly, the
spatial average difference (SAD) calculated for each
IC is defined as following [10]:

SAD = avg ( AFA ) − avg ( APA )

(2)

where AFA and APA represents the vectors of
normalized ICA mixing matrix weights of frontal
and posteriori electrodes, respectively and avg
denotes the averaging function. This feature is
calculated for every IC.
Similar to the SAD, one more control variable
called Spatial Variance Difference (SVD) is
introduced and defined as following [10]:

SVD = var( AFA ) − var( APA )

(3)

I. Markovinović, S. Vlahinić, M. Vrankić: Removal of eye…

104

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

where var denotes a variance function. Because of
the high amplitude oscillations and spatial
distribution of the eye blinking artifacts, the
variance of signals measured in frontal area should
be larger than the variance of posteriori EEG
signals, resulting in a positive SVD for the ICs
originating from eye blink artifacts. This control
variable is useful in situations where the mixing
matrix weights across the posteriori electrodes have
positive and negative values, leading to a very low
average value of the posteriori mixing matrix
weights. This could potentially lead to a false
positive classification of ICs as the eye blinking
artifact parts.

3.2.2

Temporal kurtosis

Kurtosis is widely used statistical method, based on
the high-order statistics, which is very sensitive to
outliers of the amplitude distribution, and is
calculated as [10]:

 X − µ  
Kurt [X ] = E 
 
 σ  
4

(4)

where E stands for the expected value, X is a signal
vector, and µ and σ are mean value and standard
deviation of vector X, respectively.
Combining the kurtosis with the property of high
amplitude nature of the EEG artifact signal, it is
reasonable assumption that the eye blinking artifacts
are very well captured by this measure.
Thus, combining the kurtosis with the SAD feature
will achieve better IC classification as artifacts and
non-artifacts.

of whole feature space and classifying the feature
values smaller than M into Cna class while the values
larger than M into Ca class.
The created classes Ca and Cna have been used for
calculation of two Gauss distributions, which
intersection gives a threshold value for artifact and
non-artifact feature separation. This procedure is
then iterated until the difference between the
calculated threshold values from the two
consecutive steps is lower than the user pre-defined
value. At every iteration of the ExpectedMaximisation algorithm, the Gauss distribution
statistics is updated by maximizing the loglikelihood measure.
By applying this method on the SAD measure and
kurtosis we obtain two threshold values. The final
classification of the ICs as artifacts is preformed if
the component satisfies both threshold conditions.

Enhanced artifact removing algorithm

In order to get better removal of eye blink artifacts,
some extra steps have been introduced around the
ADJUST algorithm core and some existing ones
have been modified (Fig. 3). The main reason
behind the insufficient elimination of the artifacts
can be interpreted by the ICA algorithm limitations
and assumptions. For this reasons the extra steps in
the proposed algorithm have been primarily focused
on two goals:
•
•

lowering the number of EEG samples that
are subjected to the ICs analysis and signal
processing methods;
quality measure calculation of eye blink
artifact removal algorithm for every
detected eye-blink artifact.

3.3 Features classification
4.1 The EEG data preprocessing
The Expected-Maximisation algorithm [12] has
been used in order to classify the ICs as artifacts and
non-artifacts, based on the previously discussed
temporal-spatial measures.
This algorithm takes the calculated features and
separates them into two classes Ca and Cna, where Ca
and Cna are the IC classes associated with artifacts
and the brain activity sources, respectively. The
separation is performed, by simply calculating the
median value:

M=

max(C ) + min(C )
2

(5)

Before application of the artifact removing
algorithm on the recorded datasets, datasets have
been pre-processed. Firstly, datasets have been
visually inspected and the corrupted parts of the
signals have been removed. Secondly, DC
component (mean value) of every channel has been
computed and removed from the clean EEG signals.
Thirdly, the EEG measurements have been filtered
with the 16th order FIR bandpass filter with cut-off
frequencies of 0.5 Hz and 40 Hz. In doing so, better
linear signal decomposition results have been
reported [13]. For this purpose, MATLAB filtfilt

function has been used, resulting in the filtered
signal without the phase shift.
4.2 Eye blink artifact detection method

characterized by the abrupt amplitude jumps on the
frontal electrodes of the EEG acquisition system,
but can also lead to the amplitude jumps on all
electrodes depending on the reference electrode
position.

Eye blinking artifacts are one of the worst
disturbances in the EEG signals, which are

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

For rough detection of the blinking artifact
locations, the simple peak detection method with
threshold has been used. Depending on the
acquisition system and the reference/ground
electrode positions the peak detection has been
applied on different electrodes. For the Emotiv
Epoc+, four EEG signals from frontal electrodes
(AF3, F3, AF4 and F4) have been summed up,
enhancing the artifact to clean EEG signal ratio.
Because of the differences between the reference
electrode positions in the V-Amp 16 and Emotiv
Epoc+ acquisition systems as shown in Fig. 1 and
Fig. 2, strong eye blink artifacts have been observed
on all signal electrodes of the V-Amp system. With
the same idea of enhancing artifact to clean EEG
ratio in mind, signal from all electrodes of the VAmp acquisition system have been summed up. By
applying the peak detection algorithm on the
summed signals, the positions of eye blink artifact
peaks have been located. This sample values have
been used, as a starting points for the signal
epoching and the artifact removing process.

However, it is not always possible to surround the
artifacts with the selected epoch length without
overlapping between neighbouring epochs, therefore
in those situations the epoch length is reduced by
the adjustable number of samples and the process is
repeated until the algorithm has managed to set the
epochs without the overlapping. Example of the
EEG signal with the correctly calculated epochs is
shown in Fig. 4.

4.3 The EEG dataset epoching

Figure 4. The EEG data for the Fp1 electrode (blue
signal) and final artifact epoch positions
(red signal) after the completion of
artifact epoching algorithm. All artifacts
are surrounded by their corresponding
epoch without any overlapping

The previously calculated sample markers have
been used for extraction/epoching of the EEG signal
parts affected by the eye blink artifacts. The idea
behind epoching procedure is that the ICA
algorithm is only executed over the epochs,
containing the eye blink artifacts.
One of the most important conditions for the
successful ICA is having enough data for IC
extraction. Some empirical guidelines define the
minimum number of samples for the successful and
argumentative ICA as 20-30 times number of
desired IC [14].
Following the mentioned guideline, we have
developed a simple epoching algorithm, that is
creating epochs of the same length around detected
artifacts. The algorithm is trying to enclose one or
more artifacts, depending on their sample distance.
After the initial windows have been set, the
algorithm will consecutively shift all epochs left and
right until there is no more overlapping between the
neighbouring epochs. Epochs shifting is a restrained
action, which can potentially lead to ejection of the
artifacts from the defined epoch. Following this
restrain, epochs shifting is possible only under
condition that all of the artifacts enclosed by the
epoch initialization stay in the same epoch after a
successful shift.

extraction

and

After the EEG pre-processing and epoching, the
algorithm steps for the IC extraction, the spatialtemporal feature calculation, and classification of
the extracted ICs are analog to the ADJUST
algorithm.
Two steps of the ADJUST algorithm have been
modified, and are discussed down below.
4.4.1

and

Applying the channel selection guidelines
introduced in the ADJUST algorithm [10], [15] on
our EEG acquisition systems, the following
electrodes/channels have been chosen to fill the
frontal and posteriori channel vectors, respectively.
For the Emotiv Epoc+ acquisition system we have
selected the following frontal area (FA) and
posteriori area (PA) electrodes:

FA = [AF3(Ch1), F3(Ch3), F4(Ch12), AF4(Ch14)],
PA = [P7(Ch6), O1(Ch7), O2(Ch8), P8(Ch9)],

4.5 Artifact removal
calculation

while for the V-Amp 16 acquisition system, the
following electrodes have been selected:

With the calculated feature threshold values, all of
the ICs can be classified as artifacts if both features
are larger than the respective threshold value, and as
non-artifact otherwise.
The ICs which are classified as artifact are then
removed from the EEG signal. In order to avoid
sharp edges in processed signal, caused by the
removal of the artifact related ICs, low-pass filter
has been applied to the EEG signal.
After removal of the artifact related ICs from the
EEG signal, for every epoch and every artifact, the
artifact removal success indicator has been
calculated. This indicator is used for the detection of
the artifact areas that have not been properly
processed, and further iterations are necessary to
ensure a valid result. As mentioned before, the
artifact epochs contain one or more artifacts, which
are surrounded by their respective markers. All
other samples in that epoch can be interpreted as the
“clean” EEG signal, as shown in Fig 5. First step of
the indicator calculation is to take clean parts of the
EEG signal in the associated epoch and calculate the
mean value and variance.
The calculated variance of the signal represents the
energy distribution of the “clean” EEG signal parts.
The calculated mean value is then used for the
variance calculation on the samples which are
bounded within artifact markers. The calculated
variance can be interpreted as the energy
distribution of the corrected signal. It is a reasonable
assumption that energy of the EEG signal
containing artifacts (or artifact remains), is
significantly higher than the “clean” EEG. This
assumption combined with simple threshold logic,
has been used as a measure for the inadequate
artifact removal.

FA = [Fp1(Ch1), Fp2(Ch2), F3(Ch3), Fz(Ch4),
F4(Ch5)],
PA = [P3(Ch11), Pz(Ch12), P4(Ch13), PO7(Ch14),
Oz(Ch15), PO8(Ch16)].
For the selected electrode vectors, the spatial and
temporal features and related threshold values have
been calculated as explained in Section 3.
4.4.2

The independent components analysis

For our purposes the Fast ICA (FICA) algorithm
[6], [16] has been used. The FICA algorithm is
applied on all epochs with the PCA dimension
reduction (typ. 12 ICs have been extracted per
epoch). Default outputs of the FICA function are the
mixing matrix A, the weight matrix W (inverse of
the mixing matrix A) and the independent
components IC. Mentioned values have been used
for spatial and temporal feature calculation
associated with the eye blink artifacts.
In addition to those 3 default outputs, the 4th output
has been added and defined as a convergence
success indicator. This indicator indicates that the
FICA convergence has not been successful and that
the given FICA results are not correct. The FICA
algorithm will be repeated until the successful
convergence or the maximum allowed number of
iterations. In every new iteration, a new initial value
of the mixing matrix A for FICA algorithm will be
generated. If the maximal number of FICA attempts
has been reached, without successful IC extraction,
the affected epochs are marked and skipped by the
artifact removing algorithm.

proposed artifact removal algorithm (red line) on the Fp1, Fz, Cz and Pz electrodes. The blue line

4.6 Improving removal results
If the “artifact” energy is significantly larger than
the energy of the “clean” EEG signal, the associated
epochs will be marked as “unsuccessfully cleaned”
and the artifact removal algorithm will be repeated
on that epoch. This includes a new execution of the
FICA algorithm, calculation of new classification
features, and the calculation of success indicator.
The main reason behind the unsuccessful artifacts
removal is most likely the ICA, caused by its
statistical approach, simplifications and assumptions
(eg. equal or less number of electrodes and active

sources, linearity, etc.). In fact 50-70% of the
returned ICs do not have a neurological
interpretation [17].
For this reason, the unsuccessfully processed epochs
are iteratively subjected to the removing algorithm
until the necessary success indicator values are
satisfied, or the maximum number of iterations has
been reached.

The results

Validation of the proposed artifact removal
algorithm has been conducted on 24 recordings,

recorded as explained in the Section 2. A ratio
between the signal energies of clean EEG signal
parts and the corrupted signal parts has been
calculated in order to validate results for all trials on
all electrodes. Furthermore, to get better view on
performance of the proposed algorithm, the energy
ratios have been compared with the energy ratios of
the EEG recordings processed by the open-source
EEGLAB plug-in artifact removal algorithms:
Automatic Artifact Removal tool (AAR) [18],
ADJUST, Multiple Artifact Rejection Algorithm
(MARA) [19][20], Fully Automated Statistical
Thresholding for EEG artifact Rejection (FASTER)
[21]. Due to fact that the FASTER tool is a high
density EEG artifact removal algorithm for the
acquisition systems with more than 32 electrodes,
no comparison between the algorithms has been
conducted.
Applying the MARA artifact removal algorithm on
the EEG recordings, by removing all artifacts from
the EEG signal, but at cost of removing almost all
essential neurological parts. This is very pronounced

on the frontal electrodes, as it can be seen from Fig.
7. The reason for such performance is that the
MARA classifier marked 15 out of possible 16 ICs,
returned by the ICA algorithm, as artifacts. As
reported in [19] the MARA algorithm has been
validated on different EEG recordings with
electrode sets that covered the entire scalp with the
approximately equidistant electrode positioning.
However, the performance of the MARA algorithm
has not been analysed on the EEG acquisition
systems with the reduced number of electrodes.
From the presented results we can only conclude
that the MARA algorithm performed extremely
aggressive on the low-density EEG recordings, and
thus, the MARA algorithm is not suitable for the
EEG electrode configurations used in this paper.
Improvement of the results can be achieved by the
manual inspection and classification of the artifact
related ICs. However, the proposed algorithm is
fully automated, and thus, no further comparison
between the MARA algorithm and proposed artifact
removing algorithm has been conducted.

Figure 7. Fraction of the EEG signal after the
artifact removal with the MARA tool
(red line) on Fp1, Cz and Pz
electrodes, respectively. Blue lines
represent the original corrupted EEG
signals

Compared to the ADJUST artifact removing
algorithm, the ability of proposed algorithm to repeat
the artifact removal process on “unsuccessfully
cleaned” epochs, provided better artifact removal
results, as shown in Fig. 6. Table 1. shows the energy
ratios between the clean and the corrupted EEG signal
areas over all EEG channels for the proposed removal
algorithm (ARA), and the EEGLAB plug-in artifact
removal tools: ADJUST and AAR. For the ratio value
equal to one, a reasonable assumption is that the
artifact removal process has been ideal due to the fact
that energies of the compared signal parts are equal.
On the other hand, if ratio values are higher than one,
the corrupted signal areas are over-filtered, or underfiltered if the ratio values are lower than one.
Figure 8. shows the energy ratio comparison between
the proposed artifact removal algorithm and the
EEGLAB plug-in artifact removal tools: ADJUST and
AAR, respectively. As shown, the proposed algorithm
has achieved better results on almost all electrodes of
used acquisition system. For the T7, P3, PO7, Oz
electrodes, the energy ratios differ considerably from
the ideal energy ratio value. This can be interpreted as
the inability of the ICA algorithm to decompose
signals on the highlighted electrodes into the ICs
which can be classified as artifacts. In order to fully
understand how the epoch length, different ICA
algorithms and different classification methods can be
optimised for achieving better artifact removing
results, signals from those electrodes will be a focus
point of our future research.

Figure 8. The energy ratio for all electrodes on
all 24 recodings after the EEG data
has been processed with the following
artifact removing algorithms: ARA
(blue bars), ADJUST (red bars), AAR
(green bars). The dotted line represents
ideal energy ratio after the artifact
removal process

Conclusion

In this paper we have proposed the artifact removal
algorithm based on the ADJUST algorithm. In order to
get better artifact removal results we have modified
the original algorithm by adding extra processing
steps. The proposed algorithm can achieve better
results through energy difference inspection between
the “clean” and the processed signal parts and
additional iterations of the artifact removal process on
the artifact corrupted epochs, which have not satisfied
the energy difference condition. In the experimental
section we have shown that the proposed algorithm
has achieved better results compared to the ADJUST
algorithm on almost all electrodes.
Moreover, the ability of the proposed artifact removal
algorithm to place epochs around the artifact peaks
and process only samples inside the corrupted epochs
is one more advantage of this approach. By doing so,

all samples outside the corrupted epochs have not
been processed, leaving the original artifact-free
EEG signal intact. Although many advanced
artifact removing algorithms like MARA and
FASTER have been introduced over the last
years, they were unable to properly clean the EEG
signal from the eye blink artifacts, for the
electrode configurations used in this paper.
Therefore, additional investigation of the artifact
removal algorithms in the low-density EEG
acquisition systems is necessary.
