A Study on the Effect of Electrical Stimulation
During Motor Imagery Learning in Brain-Computer
Interfacing
Saugat Bhattacharyya, Maureen Clerc and Mitsuhiro Hayashibe
Abstract—Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) stimulates
the affected region of the human body thus providing a neuroprosthetic interface to non-recovered muscle groups. FES in
combination with Brain-computer interfacing (BCI) has a wide
scope in rehabilitation because this system can directly link the
cerebral motor intention of the users with its corresponding
peripheral mucle activations. Such a rehabilitative system would
contribute to improve the cortical and peripheral learning and
thus, improve the recovery time of the patients. In this paper,
we examine the effect of electrical stimulation by FES on
the electroencephalography (EEG) during learning of a motor
imagery task. The subjects are asked to perform four motor
imagery tasks over six sessions and the features from the EEG
are extracted using common spatial algorithm and decoded using
linear discriminant analysis classifier. Feedback is provided in
form of a visual medium and electrical stimulation representing
the distance of the features from the hyperplane. Results suggest
a significant improvement in the classification accuracy when the
subject was induced with electrical stimulation along with visual
feedback as compared to the standard visual one.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The advent of Brain-computer interfacing (BCI) has opened
a direct communication pathway between the brain and a
peripheral device in form of robots, prosthesis, wheelchair or a
computer without any muscle intervention. BCI has immense
potential in facilitating rehabilitation for patients suffering
from stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal injury and
physical disability [1]. A BCI system would drive a neuroprosthetic device to bridge the gap between the central nerveous
system and peripheric muscles, and in some instances even
a separate prosthesis. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the
most commonly used BCI recording device and signals related
to limb movement (known as motor imagery signals) are
elicited as Event Related Desynchonization/Synchronization
(ERD/ERS) response [2],[3]. The BCI system decodes the
ERD/ERS signals to determine the movement as intended by
the user.
Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) [4],[5] aims at
directly stimulating the muscles which the patient is no longer

able to use and it is reported that FES is capable of reconstructing certain daily life skills [6]. Studies in [6],[7],[8],[9]
have shown that FES is capable of eliciting the recovery of
skills such as standing up, grasping, cycling and walking. Most
FES based rehabilitative system do not employ the cortical
activity of the patient and only use peripheral learning to
re-train the subject on his/her daily skills. A hypothesis on
augmented movement therapy by FES exists which assumes
that recovery occurs mostly due to cortical plasticity and partly
due to peripheral mechanism [10] and it has been confirmed
on motor learning tasks involving transcranial magnetic stimulation [11],[12] and functional magnetic resonance imaging
[13].
Improvement in functional recovery through cortical plasticity can be attained if a coherence between the efferent
neural activity (intentional efforts) and afferent neural activity
(peripheral efforts) is developed. In this regard the FES activates the sensory channel which provides a maximal afferent
inflow to the brain and the BCI would provide an efferent
outflow of motor commands to close the motor loop [14], [15].
Thus, the rehabilitative system would work to improve the
cortical and peripheral learning of the subject. Recently certain
groups have explored this potential in implementing BCI in
functional recovery using FES [16],[17],[18] to directly link
the mental intention of the user with the muscular response.
In such system, the BCI detects the motor intentions of the
user which in turn activates the FES device. Pfurtscheller et
al. were the first to restore hand grasp in a single case study
by combining BCI with FES transmitted via surface electrode
in [19] and an implanted stimulation system in [20]. Muller
et al. in [21] studied the affects of FES on ERD/ERS patterns
during reconstruction of the motor activity. Some EEG/MEG
studies in [18],[22] have shown the presence of ERD/ERS
patterns during an FES induced hand or leg movement tasks.
A few studies also exist on the effect of FES learning in the
performance of the BCI system. Gollee et al. in [17] found
no major influence of FES on Steady-State Visually Evoked
Potential (SSVEP) signal. Takahashi et al. in [18] also found
no effect of FES on leg stimulation. Pistohl et al. in [23]
reported the improvement of angular accuracy of movements
when the participants were provided with additional artificial
proprioceptive feedback rather than using visual feedback but
did not increase the overall accuracy determined from the
average distance between the cursor and the target.
To date, in BCI experiments feedback is commonly provided

the feedback period to aid the participant in performing the
task. Thus, in this paper, we named the ES induced sessions
as FES sessions and the sessions with only visual feedback as
VIS sessions. In this paper, we want to study the effect of ES
on the learning of the participants while performing a motor
task and compare it with the standard visual motor task. A
simplified block diagram of the our experiment is illustrated
in Fig. 1.
Three healthy male subjects (2 right handed and one left
handed), participated in this experiment. In this experiment, we
abide by the norms of Helsinki Declaration of 1975, revised
in 2000. Prior to the experiments, the subjects are informed
about the purpose of the experiment and the tasks they have
to perform.
A. Materials used

to the subject by means of a visual medium [24], [25].
On observing the feedback, the subject would attempt to
perform his task. It is an interesting notion if one includes
electrical stimulation to help in augmenting the performance
of the motor task at hand. Thus, in this paper, we report the
preliminary results of the effect of electrical stimulation on the
learning of the subject during a motor imagery training task on
healthy subjects. Through this study, we aim at employing FES
as a proprioceptive feedback to the subject [26] to improve
the learning of the subject both in terms of accuracy and time.
If successful, this system can accelerate the motor recovery
process of the patient by enhancing the motor learning in the
brain.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section
II describes the details of the experiments performed and
the analysis of the data. Section III presents the results of
the experiments and the concluding remarks are provided in
Section IV.
II. E XPERIMENT D ESIGN
In this experiment the participants performed four motor
tasks: left hand movement, right hand movement, left foot
movement and right foot movement across 6 separate sessions.
A session provides instructions to the participant through a
sequence of visual cues to execute one of the four motor
tasks and each visual cue is termed as ‘trial’. Further, for
data analysis, each trial are separated into time windows,
termed as epochs. Each session consists of a feedback session
provided visually to the participant at each trial, quantified
by the hyperplane distance of the decoder. Before the start of
the experiment, the participants undergo a training session for
decoder training and to acclimatize to the tasks. The training
session is made of 160 trials (40 trials for each task). The
first online experimental session consists of 40 trials (10 for
each task) and the last two sessions consist of 160 trials (40
trials for each task). The decoder designed in this work is a 2level hierarchy. The first level classifies between left and right
motor imagery and the second level discriminates between
hand and foot motor imagery. In 3 of the 6 sessions, surface
electrical stimulation (ES) is transmitted to the subject during

The EEG signals are recorded using a 14 channel Emotiv
Epoc neuro-headset with a sampling rate of 128Hz and an inbuilt band-pass filter of 0.2-45Hz. The electrodes: AF3, F7,
F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8 and AF4, are
arranged on the basis of the standard 10-20 system [27].
Surface electrical stimulation is relayed to induce wrist
flexion and foot plantar flexion by applying the stimulation
to the anterior compartment of the forearm for hand tasks
and the triceps surae muscle group for the foot tasks. It is
applied to each side of the hand and the foot, corresponding
to the mental task to perform. The stimulus is delivered by a
computer-controlled stimulator (ProStim, MXM, France) with
pulse width (PW) modulation [28](PW max = 400 us) at a
constant amplitude and frequency (20 Hz). Each stimulation
sequence consists of a trapezoidal envelope train of PW (0.4
s ramp-up, 1.2 s plateau, 0.4 s ramp-down).
B. Design of the visual cue
The design of the visual cue for both FES and VIS sessions
are the same. Each session starts with a baseline period of 20
seconds, during which the subject is asked to relax, followed
by a repetition of trials. Each trial has the following cues: First,
a fixation ‘+’ is displayed on screen for 1 second which is an
indicator for the subject to get ready for the task ahead. Next,
instructions of the motor task to be performed are provided
to the participant for 1 second in form of arrows, in two
separate cues of 0.5 seconds duration each. First, a left or right
arrow is displayed on screen to indicate left or right motor
imagery, respectively followed by up and down arrow which
correponds to hand and foot imagery, respectively. Following
the instructions, the feedback is displayed on-screen, in the
form of a blue bar, for 3 seconds. The subject starts performing
the task on the start of this cue while simultaneously observing
its feedback. For FES sessions, the ES is provided to the
subjects at the onset of the feedback cue. For the training
period, the feedback period of each trial is followed by a ‘+’
instead of the feedback bar. Lastly, a blank screen is displayed
for 1.5s-3.5s for the participants to relax and avoid overlapping
of the remnant EEG from the previous trial. A schematic time
representation of the visual cue is illustrated in Fig. 2.

C. Feature Extraction
Previous studies [1], [3], [29] on motor imagery suggests the
presence of ERD/ERS in the µ-rhythm (8-12 Hz) and central β
band (16-24 Hz). Thus, after acquisition, the raw EEG signal
is band-pass filtered at 8-30 Hz using an IIR butterworth filter
of order 5 and bandwidth of [8,30]Hz. This step removes the
unwanted EEG information from the signal along with noise.
Prior to feature extraction, the training data of the participants is used to train the common spatial patterns (CSP).
CSP [30] decomposes the raw EEG signal into spatial patterns
extracted from two classes of single trial EEG. The patterns
maximize the variation between the two classes. CSP was
first applied for detection of abnormalities in EEG, followed
by discrimination of EEG movement patterns by Ramoser in
[30]. The design of the CSP is based on the simultaneous
diagonalization of two covariance matrices which creates new
time series signals optimal for classification. For N channels
of EEG for two classes, say, left and right imagery trials, the
CSP algorithm creates an N × N projection matrix W [30].
W represents specific cortical activity during the motor tasks
and with W , a trial X is decomposed by
Z = WX.

(1)

The variances for the two populations are largest in the first
and last rows of Z and thus, in this work, we select the first
and last 2 rows (4 spatial filters) of W. Thus, the EEG data
X is filtered using the 4 spatial filters. Then, we calculate the
variance of the 4 new time series for an epoch T
Z t+T
VARp =
(Zp (t))2 dt.

Lastly, the variances are normalized and log-transformed to
generate 4 feature vectors.

In this work, two CSP trainers are implemented: one for
left-right imagery and the other for hand-leg imagery and the
size of the epoch T is 0.125 second.
D. Classification of the motor task
After feature extraction, the feature vectors are used as
inputs to a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier [31].
LDA aims at separating the data representing the different

classes by constructing a hyperplane. Here, the class of an
observation depends on which side of the hyperplane the
feature vector lies. It assumes normal distribution of a data
with equal covariance matrix for all classes. The separating
hyperplane is a projection that maximizes the distance between
two class means and minimizes the inter-class variance [31].
This technique is suitable for an online BCI system because it
has a low computational requirement and is simple to use. In
this work, a hierarchical classifier is designed to perform multiclass classification among the four motor tasks. As shown in
Fig. 3, the classifier first discriminates between left and right
motor imagery followed by hand and foot motor imagery.
E. Neuro-feedback training
The classifiers produces two types of output after decoding:
i) the output labels, and ii) the distance of the feature vectors
from the hyperplane (hyperplane distance) as neuro-feedback
to the participant. The neuro-feedback is displayed to the
subject in form of a blue bar during VIS sessions and a
combination of blue bar and electrical stimulation during

FES sessions. In the feedback cue, the hyperplane distance
is averaged between the two classifiers: the left-right motor
imagery classifier and the hand-foot motor imagery classifier.
The output labels control the direction of the bar and the hyperplane distance controls the length of the bar. The direction
of the feedback for this work is only displayed in the left and
right direction. Therefore, if the output of the classifier is left
hand or foot then the ideal direction of the feedback bar would
be on the left direction and it would be on the right direction
during right hand or foot output.
If the distance is large the blue bar will be longer which
suggests an increased confidence in classifying the right task.
Also, a smaller blue bar indicates smaller distance which
further motivates the participant to focus more on the task.
During the task it may occur that the classifier misclassifies
between two limbs in the same direction. For example, instead
of left leg the classifier produces a left hand output. An ideal
correct and misclassified representation of the feedback during
the tasks in illustrated in Fig.4. In such cases, the feedback
bar is again to be of smaller length and the subject makes
the necessary correction. The neuro-feedback is updated every
0.125 seconds during the feedback session of the trial and the
learning across the whole feedback session is a point of interest
in this paper.
III. R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION
In this paper, we aim to study the effect of electrical
stimulation during motor imagery learning sessions. For this
purpose, three subjects participated in a 4-class motor imagery
task: left hand imagery, right hand imagery, left foot imagery
and right foot imagery over six experimental sessions. In
three sessions, we have provided electrical stimulation to the
subjects along with visual feedback to aid him. The other three
sessions only comprised of visual feedback.
An example of the CSP patterns during FES and VIS
sessions for subject 1 is illustrated in Fig. 5. The topographical

map is prepared from the interpolation of the vector present
in the columns of W−1 of equation (1). From the left vs right
imagery section, Filt1 of FES and VIS shows low activity
in the FC6 region while Filt2 of FES has high activity in left
hemisphere which is also shown in the VIS plot but in a lower
scale. Filt1 and Filt3 show lower activity in the FC6 and FC5
region, respectively, which may indicate the presence of ERD
in the contralateral region of left and right motor imagery,
respectively. The same behaviour is also exhibited in the VIS
sessions but less prominent than the FES ones. For hand vs
leg imagery section, Filt3 of FES and Filt4 of VIS are mostly
similar but the rest of the filters are distinctly separate from
each other. It is noted in the figure that the VIS plots show
higher activity than FES plots. Most patterns in FES and VIS
show a common region of activity but FES plots show more
specific regions of activation than VIS.
The extracted features are then fed to a trained LDA classifier to get the desired output, in our case, one of the four motor
tasks. Table I provides the average results over the 3 FES
and VIS sessions in terms of accuracy(acc), sensitivity(sen),
specificity(spec) and information transfer rate (ITR) [31], [32].
Accuracy is a measure of how correctly a classifier can predict
a class. Sometimes, the accuracy may provide a skewed result
by detecting one class very well but the other class very
poorly. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity provides a more
reliable result in this context. Sensitivity suggests how good
the decoder is to detect a positive class, while Sensitivity
suggests how good it detects the negative result. ITR represents
the amount of information reliably sent to the BCI system [32]
and it is usually given by bits per trial (bpt). As noted from
Table I Subject 1 shows a high increase in accuracy, sensitivity,
specificity and ITR by 10.74%, 8.94%, 24.82% and 4.99 bpt,
respectively while Subject 2 shows a mild increase by 2.5%,
8.33%, 12.98% and 2.34 bpt, respectively. On the other hand,
subject 3 had a better performance during VIS sessions than
FES sessions.
Next, we report the learning during FES and VIS session
feedback for each trial. For this purpose, we measure the distance of the feature vector from the hyperlane for each epoch
updated at every 0.125 seconds. We took this parameter to
study the feedback effect because the larger the distance from
the hyperplane, the higher is the confidence of the classifier to
detect the right output. The average feedback curve for all the
correctly classified trials of both FES (in blue) and VIS (in red)
are shown in Fig. 6. From the curves we assume that greater

the slope of the curve, faster is the learning demonstrated
by the subject. Subject 1 demonstrates an increasing learning
effect (greater slope) for FES feedback for all the limbs, except
Right foot as compared to the VIS feedback. The figures for
Subject 2 illustrates a more prominent learning effect during
FES feedback and it is clearly differentiable for VIS feedback
even though Subject 1 showcased a higher increase in accuracy
across trials than Subject 2. It is also noted from the figures of
both the subjects that VIS feedback has a frequent increasing
and decreasing trend of the curve. Subject 3 had a decrease
in accuracy during FES feedback as compared to the VIS
feedback which can be validated from the figure that the
discriminability between the FES and VIS feedback are not
as prominent in comparison to the other subjects. We can
infer from these results that the electrical stimulation had a
positive influence during motor task learning and with an
increase in sessions one can assume ES to provide a faster
learning. The steady increase of learning during FES sessions
can be attributed to the fact that the subjects reported to be
more motivated to perform the tasks when an ES was provided
and they felt the inclusion of ES helped in their imagination.
On the other hand, during VIS sessions the subjects reported
to lose motivation in-between the tasks. We also report the
learning of trials which were incorrectly classified in Fig. 7. As
observed, most figures for the three subjects show an increase
in learning followed by a steady decrease for both FES and
VIS sessions, which may lead for the misclassification to occur
in the first place. This behaviour is completely different from
the one seen for the correctly classified trials.

and it is observed that most maps have a common region
of activation. But more experimental sessions are required to
reach a conclusive result to show a significant difference in the
CSP patterns. Results on Table I also shows a significant rise in
accuracy for Subject 1 and a mild increase of performance for
Subject 2. The tabulated results suggests a positive influence
of FES during motor learning of the subjects. The effective
increase of learning during FES sessions are further validated
from the results shown in Fig. 6. The FES sessions show a
steady increase in learning as compared to the VIS session.
Visual feedback is the widely accepted form of feedback
for such motor imagery tasks but the subject requires constant
motivation to reach an optimal result. On incorporating electrical stimulation along with visual feedback the subjects in this
experiment were reported to be more focussed in performing
the tasks, especially for the longer sessions. Based on the
results in this study, we can infer that electrical stimulation
can also be used to improve the motor training of subjects
and it can potentially provide better performance as it provides
natural proprioceptive feedback related to motor performance
than visual stimuli which requires user’s attention to visual
feedback. Further studies on a larger group of subjects are
required to validate this claim. Future studies in this research
will include changing the intensity of FES during proprioceptive neurofeedback training to BCI based on the learning
level of the subject. For example if a subject identifies left
hand well and right leg imagery poorly, then the system will
increase the intensity of FES during right leg imagery and
decrease it during left hand imagery. This will lead to an
improvement in motor imagery classification which would aid
in neuroprosthetic or robot control [33].
