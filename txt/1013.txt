De¯cits in the ability to process emotions characterize several neuropsychiatric disorders and
are traits of Parkinson's disease (PD), and there is need for a method of quantifying emotion,
which is currently performed by clinical diagnosis. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, being
an activity of central nervous system (CNS), can re°ect the underlying true emotional state of a
person. This study applied machine-learning algorithms to categorize EEG emotional states in
PD patients that would classify six basic emotions (happiness and sadness, fear, anger, surprise
and disgust) in comparison with healthy controls (HC). Emotional EEG data were recorded
from 20 PD patients and 20 healthy age-, education level- and sex-matched controls using
multimodal (audio-visual) stimuli. The use of nonlinear features motivated by the higher-order
spectra (HOS) has been reported to be a promising approach to classify the emotional states. In
this work, we made the comparative study of the performance of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and
support vector machine (SVM) classi¯ers using the features derived from HOS and from the
power spectrum. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that power spectrum and HOS based
features were statistically signi¯cant among the six emotional states (p < 0:0001). Classi¯cation results shows that using the selected HOS based features instead of power spectrum based
features provided comparatively better accuracy for all the six classes with an overall accuracy
of 70:10%  2:83% and 77:29%  1:73% for PD patients and HC in beta (13–30 Hz) band using
SVM classi¯er. Besides, PD patients achieved less accuracy in the processing of negative
emotions (sadness, fear, anger and disgust) than in processing of positive emotions (happiness,
surprise) compared with HC. These results demonstrate the e®ectiveness of applying machine
learning techniques to the classi¯cation of emotional states in PD patients in a user independent
manner using EEG signals. The accuracy of the system can be improved by investigating the
other HOS based features. This study might lead to a practical system for noninvasive assessment of the emotional impairments associated with neurological disorders.

1. Introduction
An increasing body of evidence demonstrates the importance of e®ective social
relationships for the health and well-being of older adults (Cohen & Janicki-Deverts,
2009; Gow et al., 2007). Accurately recognizing the emotional states of others is a
crucial component of successful social interaction, with comprehension (as well as
production) of emotional voice and facial expressions essential for e®ective communication in social and interpersonal relationships (Blair, 2003). Cumulating evidence
indicates that individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) have de¯cits in recognizing
emotions from prosody (Dara et al., 2008; Paulmann & Pell, 2010; Pell & Leonard,
2003; Yip et al., 2003), facial expressions (Clark et al., 2008; Dujardin et al., 2004;
Sprengelmeyer et al., 2003) and show reduced startle reactivity to highly arousing
unpleasant pictures (Bowers et al., 2006; Miller et al., 2009). There is sparse event
related potential (ERP) evidence that early processing of emotional prosody (mismatch negativity; Schr€
oder et al., 2006) and faces (early posterior negativity; Wieser
et al., 2012) may be a®ected in PD. A number of studies have failed to ¯nd de¯cits
in emotion recognition (Adolphs et al., 1998; Madeley et al., 1995; Pell & Leonard,
2005); others have documented speci¯c de¯cits in recognizing at least some basic
emotions (Lawrence et al., 2007; Suzuki et al., 2006). Finally, although some studies
have documented de¯cits in recognizing emotion both facial displays and prosody
(Ariatti et al., 2008), others have documented de¯cits in recognizing emotion only in
one stimulus modality (Clark et al., 2008; Kan et al., 2004). Altogether, experimental
evidence so far supports the view of de¯cits in emotion processing in PD patients.
Much of the research in this area focused on the patients behavioral responses (i.e.,
participants asked to match, to identify or to rate the emotional stimuli) and
physiological measures of emotional experience (e.g., startle eye blink and ERPs).
The existing literature mentioned above used traditional statistical analysis tools for
the investigation of emotion processing in PD. There is no quantitative objective
measurement that correlates with the a®ective impairment in neurological disorder
patients compared to healthy controls (HC). This underlines the need for an objective quantitative measure of emotional processing that can identify and quantify
subtle changes in a®ect and hence help in a group based comparative analysis between patients and HC, thereby enabling the assessment of emotional impairment
treatment e±cacy and progression of the disease.
Lately, numerous studies on computational approaches to automatic emotion
recognition have been published, although research in that ¯eld is relatively new
compared to the long history of emotion research in psychology and psychophysiology. The approaches used for the automatic emotion recognition in HC, mainly
focusing on the audio–visual channels of emotional expression such as facial expression (Cohen et al., 2000), speech signals (Kim, 2007) and gestures (Kessous et al.,
2010). Though these modalities are researched widely and have produced better
results, they are all susceptible to social masking. Emotions that are not expressed,
emotions expressed di®erently (an angry person may smile) or minor emotional

changes that are invisible to the natural eye, cannot be tracked by using these
modalities (Bailenson et al., 2008). These limitations direct the way to recognizing
emotion through physiological signals (often called \biosignals"). Physiological signals re°ects the inherent activity of the autonomous nervous system (ANS) or central
nervous system (CNS), inhibiting any conscious or intentional control by the person
(Kim & Andre, 2008). It is noninvasive, subjective, complex and di±cult to uniquely
map physiological signals to di®erent emotions. However, it is reliable as it can
identify the emotional state of the person. It also provides an opportunity to track
minute emotional changes that may not be perceived visually (Kim et al., 2004; Rani
& Sarkar, 2006).
Biosignals used in most of the studies were recorded from ANS in the periphery,
such as electrocardiogram (ECG), skin conductance (SC), electromyogram (EMG),
respiration rate (RR), pulse, etc. (Haag et al., 2004; Rani & Sarkar, 2006). In addition
to these periphery biosignals, signals captured from the CNS, such as electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetoencephalogram (MEG), positron emission tomography
(PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have been proved to
provide informative characteristics in response to emotional states. Toward such a
more reliable emotion recognition procedure, EEG (Murugappan et al., 2010; Petrantonakis & Hadjileontiadis, 2010, 2011) appears to be less invasive and the one
with best time resolution than the other three (MEG, PET and fMRI). EEG has been
used in cognitive neuroscience to investigate the regulation and processing of emotion
for the past decades. Power spectra of the EEG were often assessed in several distinctive frequency bands, such as delta (: 1–4 Hz), theta (: 4–8 Hz), alpha ( : 8–
13 Hz), beta ( : 13–30 Hz) and gamma (: 30–49 Hz), to examine their relationship
with the emotional states (Aftanas et al., 2004; Davidson, 2004). Frontal midline
theta power modulation is suggested to re°ect a®ective processing during audio
stimuli (Sammler et al., 2007). The alpha-power asymmetry on the prefrontal cortex
has been proposed as an index for the discrimination between positively and negatively valenced emotions (Davidson, 2004). Beta activity has been associated with
emotional arousal modulation (Aftanas et al., 2006). Finally, gamma band is mainly
related to arousal e®ects (Balconi & Lucchiari, 2008).
In the recent years, researchers have been using non-linear approaches in various
areas of biosignal processing for estimating heart rate, nerve activity, renal blood
°ow, arterial pressure and stress using signals such as EEG, ECG, HRV, EMG and
RR (Kannathal et al., 2004; Melillo et al., 2011). Non-linear analysis based on chaos
theory helps in identifying the apparently irregular behaviors that are present in the
system (Gao et al., 2011). Several nonlinear features such as correlation dimension
(CD), approximate entropy (APEN), largest lyapunov exponent (LLE), higher-order
spectra (HOS) and Hurst exponent (H ) has been used widely (Balli & Palaniappan,
2010; Chua et al., 2011; Kannathal et al., 2005) to characterize the EEG signal. In
general, any analysis technique that can detect and compute some aspect of nonlinear mechanisms, may better re°ect the dynamics and the characteristics of the
EEG signal, and provide more realistic information about the physiological and

pathological state of the CNS, the phenomenon of non-linearity and deviations of the
signal from Guassianity (Shen et al., 2000). HOS are known to have the ability to
detect non-linearity and deviations from Guassianity. Motivated by these, a set of
HOS based parameters were proposed as features to study six emotional state
(happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust) changes in PD patients compared with HC using EEG signals. Recently, Hosseini (2012) achieved 82.32% accuracy in recognizing emotions (neutral and negative) from EEG signals using HOS
and this clearly indicates that HOS can be used to seek emotional information from
biosignals. In this work, we made a comparative study of the performance of
k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classi¯ers using the
emotional features derived from HOS and from the power spectrum. Our results
indicate the presence of more emotional information in HOS based features compared
to the power spectrum based features in PD patients and HC. The classi¯er-based
framework that we propose for determining subtle emotional changes in general and
applicable to group-wise analysis of all a®ect-related disorder, against HC.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In Sec. 2, we provide a brief description of the participant's characteristics, experimental protocol and EEG-signal
recording. In Sec. 3, we discussed the methodology which includes preprocessing,
feature extraction (power spectrum based features and HOS based features) and
classi¯cation algorithms used in this work. In Sec. 4, experimental results of the work
are presented and discussed in Sec. 5. Finally, Sec. 6 presents the limitations of the
present study and concludes in Sec. 7. To our knowledge, no study has yet been
conducted to explore the correspondence between emotional states and EEG frequency bands in PD patients.

patients. Exclusion criteria for controls included any current psychiatric or neurological disorder. Exclusion criteria for both groups were dementia or depression as
indicated by a score of 24 or lower on the mini-mental state examination (MMSE)
(Folstein et al., 1975; Wieser et al., 2012) or 18 or higher on the Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI) (Beck et al., 1961; Schr€oder et al., 2006). All participants were righthanded as determined by self-report and con¯rmed by Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI) (Old¯eld, 1971). This test consisted of 10 questions asking for the
preferred hand for a series of activities (e.g., writing, throwing, using scissors, etc).
All participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
2.3. Participants characteristics
Demographic and clinical characteristic of patients with PD and HC are presented in
Table 1. Patients and controls were comparable in demographic variables such as age
(PD: mean age ¼ 59:05  5:64 years; HC: mean age ¼ 58:10  2:95 years), tð38Þ ¼
0:667, p ¼ 0:509, gender distribution (PD: 10 men, HC: 9 men), x 2 ð1; N ¼ 40Þ

years), tð38Þ ¼ 0:455, p ¼ 0:652. Furthermore, PD patients and HC did not di®er
in mean MMSE scores, mean BDI scores as well as mean EHI scores.
The severity of motor symptoms corresponded to the Stages 1 to 3 (mild unilateral
to moderate bilateral disability) of the Hoehn and Yahr scale (Hoehn & Yahr, 1967)
and to an average score of 17:05  3:15 in the motor scale of the uni¯ed Parkinson's
disease rating scale (UPDRS) (Fahn et al., 1987). Motor symptoms were characterized as left dominant (n¼11) and right dominant (n ¼ 9). Duration of the disease
varied between 1–12 years, with a mean of 5:75  3:52 years. All of the patients
were undergoing dopamine replacement therapy and were tested while being administered their anti-parkinsonian medication (i.e., during their \on" state), distributed as follows: d2-agonist (n ¼ 18); carbidopa/L-dopa (n ¼ 13), monoamine

2.4. The modeling and classi¯cations of emotions
In addition to the cognitive theory, several theories of emotions have developed over
the past century (Cornelius, 1996). These di®erent views gave rise to di®erent models
of emotions. The most commonly used are the dimensional and discrete models of
emotions. The discrete model includes six basic emotions (happiness, sadness, fear,
anger, surprise and disgust) that are universally accepted. All other emotions are
considered to be a part of these basic emotions (Ekman & Friesen, 1987). The dimensional model, as in Fig. 1, speci¯es emotions on the basis of two main dimensions
i.e., arousal and valence. Valence stands for one's judgment about a situation as
positive or negative and arousal spans from calmness to excitement, expressing
degrees of one's excitation. All emotions can be plotted on the valence-arousal plot
(Lang, 1995). In addition to the two-dimensional model, researchers are also proposed a three-dimensional model of emotions which takes into account the attentionrejection property (Kim & Andre, 2008). In this work, six basic emotions (happiness,
sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust) based on discrete emotional modal were
considered.
2.5. Stimulus material
Until now, most studies on emotion recognition in PD have used only facial stimuli,
prosodic stimuli or music stimuli (Gray & Tickle-Degnen, 2010; Lima et al., 2013;
Peron et al., 2012). In addition, a wide range of elicitation methods have been applied
in HC: images (e.g., IAPS described below) (Petrantonakis & Hadjileontiadis, 2010,

2011), sounds (e.g., music and IADS described below) (Hadjidimitriou & Hadjileontiadis, 2012; Kim & Andre, 2008; Lin et al., 2010), movies (Davidson et al., 1990;
Gross & Levenson, 1995), multimodal approach (i.e., combination of audio and visual) (Baumgartner et al., 2006; Jerritta et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2004; Murugappan
et al., 2009; Yuvaraj et al., 2013) and so on. Among all these stimuli modalities
researchers have identi¯ed that multimodal stimuli induce target emotions better
(Gross & Levenson, 1995; Kim et al., 2004; Murugappan et al., 2009; Wang & Guan,
2008) compared to other modalities. Hence, in this work emotions were induced by
multimodal approach.
The emotional stimuli we used were taken from di®erent sources such as the
International A®ective Picture System (IAPS) database (Lang et al., 1993), International A®ective Digitized Sounds (IADS) (Bradley & Lang, 2007) database and
video clips (e.g., funny animals, wonder activities by humans etc) collected from
various resources on the internet (e.g., YouTube, Facebook and others) (Jerritta et
al., 2013). The elicitation of emotions such as sadness, fear and disgust was attained
by using a®ective pictures from IAPS and sounds from IADS databases. Various
psychological and psychophysiological experiments have revealed that these stimuli
sets have great potential in the investigation of sad, fear and disgust emotions
(Baumgartner et al., 2006; Brown et al., 2011). Additionally, Mikels (Mikels et al.,
2005) & Redondo et al., (Redondo et al., 2008) provided a more complete characterization of the categorical structure of the IAPS and IADS stimulus set, with the
objective of identifying images and sounds that elicit one discrete emotion more than
other emotions. The IAPS picturesa [disgust: valence- mean ðSDÞ ¼ 2:43 (1.51),
arousal mean ðSDÞ ¼ 5:90 (2.25); fear: valence mean ðSDÞ ¼ 3:80 (1.89), arousal
mean ðSDÞ ¼ 5:85 (2.12); sad: valence- mean ðSDÞ ¼ 2:74 (1.57), arousal mean ðSD
Þ ¼ 5:00 (2.08)] and IADS soundb [disgust: valence mean ðSDÞ ¼ 4:00 (1.72), arousal
mean ðSDÞ ¼ 5:82 (1.93); fear: valence mean ðSDÞ ¼ 4:00 (1.72), arousal mean ðSD
Þ ¼ 5:82 (1.93); sad: valence mean ðSDÞ ¼ 3:28 (1.65), arousal mean ðSDÞ ¼ 6:61
(1.89)] were selected and combined together according to their arousal and valence
values provided in the databases. For example, a negative/high aroused sound was
matched with a negative/high aroused image.
On the other hand, the emotions happiness, surprise and anger were elicited using
video clips. In order to select e±cient video clips, that would elicit the target emotions better, a pilot was conducted. For this, around 30 video clips per emotional

state were collected. Thirty volunteers in the mean age of 26.4 years (ranging from 24
to 45 years) participated in the pilot study to rate the emotions they experienced
when watching the video clips. All of them were psychology teachers or students of
the UKM medical center, Kuala Lumpur. Thirty video clips (ten for each emotion)
with the highest rating were chosen for data collection experiment.
2.6. Experimental protocol
The protocol used in this experiment is shown in Fig. 2. The protocol had two
sessions with break of 10–15 min between the sessions. Each session had three trials
with neutral images displayed for 10 s between the trials. The break between sessions
and trials would help the participant to relax during the experiment and to avoid any
feedback from the previous emotional stimuli. The multimodal stimulus pertaining to
all the six emotional states (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust)
were played in each trail in predetermined random fashion. Each combination of
picture and sound was presented for six seconds (Kim, 2007). To maximize the
participants' emotional response, each clip block consisted of six combinations of the
same emotional category and lasted for 36 s. In addition, each of the video clips varied
from 36–45 s in duration, depending on the length of the clip. Besides, a 15 s rating
interval (Hamdi et al., 2012) was provided between the clips in which participants
answered a ¯ve point self-assessment scale. Each session of the protocol lasted for
30 min approximately.

disturbance. In order to obtain a good physiological data, the participants were
requested to relax before the start of the experiment and concentrate on the emotional stimuli. At the end of each clip, the participants ¯lled a self-assessment
questionnaire where they identi¯ed/experienced the emotional state when watching
the clips. They also rated the intensity of the emotional state on a ¯ve point scale
(1 ¼ very low, 2 ¼ low, 3 ¼ medium, 4 ¼ high and 5 ¼ very high). These ratings
were then used to understand the intensity of the emotional state they experienced.
An example of the self-assessment questionnaire is as shown in Fig. 4. However,
despite the intensity levels, all the emotional data was taken into considerations.
2.8. EEG-signal recordings
EEG recordings were conducted using the Emotive EPOC 14 channel EEG wireless
recording headset (Emotive Systems, Inc., San Francisco, CA) (Hadjidimitriou &
Hadjileontiadis, 2012). The electrode scheme was arranged according to the international 10–20 system and included active electrodes at AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7,
O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8 and AF4 positions, referenced to the common mode
sense (CMS-left mastoid)/driven right leg (DRL-right mastoid) ground as shown in
Fig. 5. The acquired data were digitized using the embedded 16-bit ADC with 128 Hz

3. Methodology
A block diagram of the proposed emotion recognition system is illustrated in Fig. 7.
After the data recording, all signals were preprocessed i.e., ¯ltered and segmented.
Then, the most signi¯cant features were extracted. Finally, features were classi¯ed
using machine learning methods. A brief description on each block is given below.
3.1. Preprocessing
The raw EEG data was split as per the emotional states according to the participant's self-assessment. Then, the EEG signals were band-passed ¯ltered in the frequency range of 1–49 Hz (IIR Butterworth 6th order ¯lter with zero-phase shift). The
focus was to obtain the ¯ve traditional EEG frequency bands: delta (1–4 Hz), theta
(4–8 Hz), alpha (8–13 Hz), beta (13–30 Hz) and gamma (30–49 Hz), thus, features
were estimated for each of these bands. A study published by Kim (2007) proposed
the use of di®erent epoch size that depends on modality, e.g., 2–6 s for speech, and 3–
15 s for biosignals (Kim, 2007). In this study, the EEG signals were segmented into 6 s
epoch corresponding to the duration of each multimodal stimuli projection.
3.2. Feature extraction
3.2.1. Power spectrum-based features
Power spectral analysis is typically performed with EEG epochs by computing the
discrete Fourier transform (DFT). DFT of the given signal EEG signal xðnÞ is given

In this work, epochs of 768 samples of EEG signals, corresponding to 6 s are used for
computing the averaged Fourier spectrum and its magnitude–squared, the power
spectrum. From the power spectrum above three features are extracted for our
analysis.
3.2.2. HOS-based features
HOS (also known as polyspectra) are the spectral representations of higher-order
moments or cumulants of a signal. In particular, this paper studies feature related to
the third-order statistics of a signal, and the corresponding HOS, namely the bispectrum. The bispectrum Bðf1 ; f2 Þ of a signal is the Fourier transform of the thirdorder correlation of the signal. It is given by
Bðf1 ; f2 Þ ¼ E½Xðf1 ÞXðf2 ÞX  ðf1 þ f2 Þ;

ð5Þ

where Xðf Þ is the DFT of the EEG signal xðnT Þ, X  ðf1 þ f2 Þ denotes complex conjugate and E½ stands for expectation operator.
The frequency f may be normalized by the Nyquist frequency to be between 0
and 1. The bispectrum, given by Eq. (5), is a complex-valued function of two frequencies. The bispectrum which is the product of three Fourier coe±cients, exhibits

In order to calculate bispectral features, we used epochs of 768 samples with an
overlap of 384 point (i.e., 50%) and Hanning window, corresponding to six seconds at
the given sampling rate. These epochs were taken from each record of 1024 point.
3.3. Machine learning-based emotion classi¯cation methodology
and algorithms
We have constructed classi¯ers for PD patients and HC group under six basic
emotions (i.e., PDðhappy vs: sad vs: fear vs: anger vs: surprise vs: disgustÞ and HCðhappy vs: sad vs: fear
vs: anger vs: surprise vs: disgustÞ ) across delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma and ALL (refers
to combination of ¯ve EEG frequency bands) frequency bands. The classi¯cation

approach adopted in this study was user independent i.e., classi¯cation was performed on the complete dataset of six emotions, created from PD patients and HC
group EEG responses. Two classi¯ers are employed namely kNN, and SVM for the
classi¯cation of emotional states and their brief description of these are given below.
We also tested other classi¯cation techniques such as LDA, PNN and Naive Bayes.
However, these results are not superior to those obtained with other methods and
hence are not reported.
3.3.1. k-nearest neighbor
The kNN classi¯cation is one of the simplest classi¯cation methods. In this algorithm, k nearest training samples for a test sample is found. Then, test sample is
assigned to particular class which is most frequent class among k nearest training
data. This algorithm only requires an integer value for k and a metric to measure
closeness (Han & Kamber, 2006). One of the most common and popular choices to
measure the distance for this algorithm is Euclidean measure (Eq. (9)); as such, we
have used the Euclidean distance as a metric for measuring the adjacency of neighboring input. In this work, di®erent values of \k" between 1 and 10 are tested and we
have obtained better classi¯cation accuracy when k ¼ 5.

3.3.2. Support vector machine
In recent years, SVM classi¯ers have demonstrated excellent performance in a variety
of pattern recognition problems (Burgees, 1998). SVM maps samples to points in a
space in such a way that samples belonging to separate category (i.e., classes) are
divided or separated by a very clear gap that is as wide as possible. When the new test
data are applied, they will be mapped to the same space. The decision on the class
of test data is made based on which side of the gap the data maps. Hyperplane is
used to classify two classes and a set of hyperplanes are used to classify multiclass
problem. The best hyperplane yields the largest separation or margin between
the two classes. SVM classi¯er transforms nonlinear data to a separable form with
help of various kernel functions (Muller et al., 2001). The radial basis function (RBF)
and polynomial kernels are commonly used (Christianini & Taylor, 2000). With the
use of kernels, an explicit transformation of the data to the feature space is not
required. In this experiment, we used the RBF kernel function with a one-against-all
algorithm to classify six emotional states. The performance parameters of SVM-RBF

(regularization constant [C ] and width [] of the kernel) are found out by using the
grid search approach as suggested by (Hsu et al., 2003). In this work, we achieved
improved classi¯cation accuracy using C ¼ 108 and  ¼ 2:434.
3.3.3. Classi¯cation evaluation procedure
In this work, 10-fold cross validation schemes are used to prove the reliability of the
classi¯cation results, where the extracted feature vectors are divided randomly into
10 sets and training is repeated for 10 times. A total of 4320  42 [20 participant's 
6 emotions  6 trails  6 segments per channel 3 features  14 channels] datasets
were used training and testing with 720 datasets from each of the six emotional states
under each group for delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency band. These
4320 datasets were subdivided into 10 equal parts (roughly). During each fold, 432
datasets were used for testing. This process is repeated for 9 more times. The overall
performance of the classi¯er is evaluated by taking the average and standard deviation of 10 folds. The standard deviation of the classi¯cation clearly demonstrates the
consistency of the classi¯er results.
4. Experimental Results
4.1. Self-assessment report
Table 2 shows the results of self-assessment classi¯cation accuracy (in percentage) of
the six basic emotions for PD patients and HC obtained from confusion matrix. The
results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the self-assessment report did not show
any signi¯cant di®erences (p > 0:05) on PD patients and HC among the six emotional states. Overall, the happiness emotion was recognized better on both participants with a maximum accuracy (PD ¼ 93:42%, HC ¼ 92:50%) and disgust
emotion was recognized poorest with a least accuracy (PD ¼ 72:67%, HC ¼ 66:50%).

4.2. Emotional EEG data
The statistical signi¯cance of the extracted features from PD patients and HC across
delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma and ALL frequency bands on both the feature
extraction methods was studied using ANOVA with a threshold of p < 0:05.
Table 3 shows the range of spectral based features used for emotion classi¯cation
across di®erent EEG frequency bands for PD patients and HC. These features show
very low p-value (p < 0:0001) indicating that they are statistically signi¯cant among
six emotional states feature values. HOS based features are reported in Table 4.
Again, these features show very low \p-value" (p < 0:0001) indicating that they are
statistically signi¯cant. These results also ensure the probability of achieving better
classi¯cation accuracy. Furthermore, we also obtained signi¯cant di®erence from the
condition ALL frequency bands among six emotional states (p < 0:05). In general,
emotional feature values decrease from HC participants to PD patients during
emotion information processing in both spectral and HOS based features.
Tables 5(a) and 5(b) shows the classi¯cation results of SVM and kNN classi¯er
with power spectral based features. We can observe that the classi¯cation performance of beta frequency band features evidently performs better than other frequency bands. The SVM classi¯er classi¯es six emotional states with maximum
average accuracies of 66:70%  1:29% and 70:51%  1:30% for PD patients and HC,
respectively. The kNN classi¯er gives a maximum average classi¯cation rate of
64:26%  1:59% and 67:84%  2:34% for PD patients and HC on classifying six
emotional states, respectively. Similarly, the results of the classi¯ers with HOS based
features are given in Tables 6(a) and 6(b). Again, the HOS based features on beta
frequency band gives a maximum average emotion classi¯cation rate on PD and HC
compared to other frequency bands. For the case of SVM classi¯er with HOS based
features, the maximum average classi¯cation accuracies of 70:10%  2:83% and 77:
29%  1:73% for PD patients and HC emotional EEGs, respectively. Therefore, there
is an average of 3.40% and 6.78% improvement over the case of spectral based
classi¯er in PD patients and HC emotional state classi¯cation. For the case of kNN
classi¯er with HOS based features, the maximum average classi¯cation accuracies of
68:54%  1:90% and 73:40%  1:72% for PD patients and HC emotional EEGs,
respectively. In this case, there is an average of 4.28% and 5.56% improvement over
the case of spectral based emotional classi¯cation in PD patients and HC. Figure 9
shows the beta band classi¯cation accuracy of PD patients and HC across six emotional states for HOS based features applied to SVM classi¯er (maximum classi¯cation rate achieved for six emotional states).
In all combination of features set, the emotional classi¯cation accuracy of
PD patients is lower than HC, suggesting that emotional impairments associated
with PD patients. Notably, this experimental result indicates that PD patients
achieved less pattern classi¯cation accuracy in the processing of negative emotions
(sadness, fear, anger and disgust) than in processing of positive emotions (happiness,
surprise).

Tables 7(a) and 7(b) show average confusion matrices of the PD patients and HC
obtained for the power spectrum-based features and HOS-based features for all the
six emotional states applied to SVM classi¯er using beta band. The confusion matrix
from the tables in both groups indicates that the features were classi¯ed as surprise or
sadness instead of happiness; disgust, fear or anger instead of sadness. Also, a signi¯cant number of disgust features were wrongly classi¯ed as sadness. The emotion
misclassi¯cation is mainly due to the subjective nature of emotions where the intensity and valence of emotion induced vary from person to person. It also infers the

presence of multiple emotions in the participants which has to be dealt with
appropriately.
5. Discussions
We have presented a framework for classifying six basic emotions in PD patients
based on computerized pattern analysis, against HC. In the self-assessment data, no
signi¯cant di®erences were found for PD patients and HC among the six emotional
states. It is noteworthy that these ¯ndings are not due to small data set size in
statistical testing since PD patients were descriptively even better in recognizing
stimuli happiness, fear and disgust compared to HC (see Table 2).
Di®erent researchers made use of the fact that HOS is capable of analyzing hidden
characteristics of EEG which standard spectral estimation cannot for di®erent EEG
processing applications. A HOS based BIS index (i.e., bispectral index) monitoring
method is probably one of the most popular commercially available anesthesia
monitoring methods (Myles et al., 2004). Huang et al. (2004) used a method called
third-order recursive (TOR) to estimate the bispectrum of scalp EEG from rats
obtained during ischemia (Huang et al., 2007). They were able to achieve 91.67%
accuracy in performing injury assessment with the derived features namely weighted
center of bispectrum (WCOB) and bicoherence index. In other work, the moments of
HOS analysis were used to classify EEG signals corresponding to left/right-hand
motor imagery (Zhou et al., 2008). The feature set included parameters derived from
moments of the power spectrum and moments based on the bispectrum of the EEG
signals. Experimental results have shown that based on the proposed features, the
LDA classi¯er, SVM classi¯er and NN classi¯er achieved better classi¯cation results

than those of the BCI-competition 2003 winner (Blankertz et al., 2004; Schlogl,
2003).
In this study, we made use of HOS as features (Mavg , P1 and P2 ) for emotional
state classi¯cation in PD patients in comparison with HC. Furthermore, EEGs are
very complex signals with possible non-linearity interaction among its frequency
components and perhaps some form of phase coupling. These \random" signals
cannot be fully described by second-order measures (i.e., power spectrum). Our experimental result shows that the classi¯ers with the HOS based features perform
better than the classi¯er with second-order measures (see Tables 5(a), 5(b), 6(a) and
6(b)). Higher-order spectra information is able to reveal some information about nonlinearity and deviation of Guassianity which could likely be present in emotional
EEGs. Hence, HOS based features become more discriminative than those of secondorder measures from power spectrum.
A number of research works have been done to classify emotional states using EEG
signals in user independent way. For HC, the highest accuracy for six emotional
states were: 85:83%  7:14% for happiness, 71:31%  5:07% for sadness, 73:72% 
5:32% for fear, 74:06%  4:49% for anger, 82:47%  5:09% for surprise and 76:36% 
7:19% for disgust (see Table 6(a)). It is di±cult to compare the obtained accuracy of
emotional states with previous research works in HC, since number of targeted
emotional states varied from study to study. Therefore, the overall classi¯cation
accuracy of the emotional states is compared. So far, a maximum average classi¯cation accuracy of 85.17% has been achieved on recognizing six emotions (happiness,
surprise, anger, fear, disgust and sadness) in user independent approach (Petrantonakis & Hadjileontiadis, 2010). Similarly, 82.29% and 93.5% has been obtained for
detecting four emotions (joy, anger, sadness and pleasure) and two emotions (happiness and sadness), respectively in user independent approach (Li & Lu, 2009; Lin
et al., 2010). Recently, Hosseini (2012) achieved an average accuracy of 82.32% for
only two emotional states (neutral and negative) on image-induced EEG emotional
dataset using HOS. In contrast to previous report in emotion recognition with young
adults, this present study achieved 77:29%  1:73% in older adult HC participants on
classifying six emotions in a user independent way by using nonlinear feature HOS.
Since we examined considerably older adult participants (mean age of 58:10  2:95
years) than all previous studies, this lower average accuracy is most likely due to the
participants' age. Age is known to be associated with a decline in cognitive functions
(Friedman, 2003; Orgeta, 2009; Ru®man et al., 2008). In a comparable way, age may
be associated with a decline in emotional processing.
For PD patients, the better classi¯cation accuracy for six emotional states were:
80:14%  5:40% for happiness, 64:04  7:14% for sadness, 66:50%  5:49% for fear,
65:28%  5:99% for anger, 76:50%  5:90% for surprise and 68:19%  7:72% for
disgust (see Table 6(a)). This provided a di®erent viewpoint and new insights into
emotional responses to PD patients. So far, no related work that speci¯cally
attempted the EEG frequency bands based emotion recognition in PD patients using
machine learning techniques has been reported in the literature and therefore, it was

di±cult for the acquired results to be discussed. In addition, the better results were
achieved through the activity of beta band, which have been suggested to re°ect
emotional phenomenon (Aftanas et al., 2006). In general, a direct comparison between
the classi¯cation accuracy and self-assessment evaluation for emotions reveals that
happiness followed by surprise (with highest accuracy) was the easiest to identify and
disgust followed by sadness (with lowest accuracy) was the most di±cult, with anger
and fear being of intermediate di±culty to identify from the PD patients results.
In the group of HC, the highest average accuracy of classi¯ed six emotional states
in the frequency band was: 56:59%  3:87% for delta, 70:47%  2:14% for theta,
73:90%  1:88% for alpha, 77:29%  1:73% for beta, 56:20%  1:87% for gamma and
74:90%  2:92% for all condition (see Table 6(a)). Notably, in the PD patient's only
highest accuracy of 50:34%  2:33% for delta, 65:44%  1:46% for theta, 68:36% 
1:73% for alpha, 70:10%  2:83% for beta, 49:73%  3:38% for gamma and 69:48% 
1:42% for all condition was obtained (see Table 6(a)). The values across the frequency bands clearly indicate that the classi¯cation accuracy of PD patient's emotional state EEG is lower than HC during emotion processing, suggesting that
emotional impairments associated with PD patients. This ¯nding indicates the
neuropathological evidence that PD could be associated with the slowing of oscillatory brain activity (Neufeld et al., 1988; Yeager et al., 1966). This slowing of brain
activity exhibits a signi¯cant correlation with progression of Hoehn & Yahr stages in
PD (Morita et al., 2009). Although our PD participants were tested on dopaminergic
medication, they still revealed signs of dopamine de¯ciency as indicated by a mean
value of 17.05 in the motor part of the UPDRS. In addition, we also observed that PD
patients achieved less pattern classi¯cation accuracy in the processing of negative
emotions (sadness, fear, anger and disgust) than in processing of positive emotions
(happiness, surprise). As many researchers have suggested, individuals with PD may
be particularly impaired in recognizing negative emotions because of dysfunction in
speci¯c neural circuits (Adolphs et al., 1996; Bouchard et al., 2008; Lawrence et al.,
2007; Sprengelmeyer et al., 2003; Suzuki et al., 2006; Tessitore et al., 2002). Recent
evidence points to neuropathological changes in PD in many brain areas which are
assumed to play key roles in emotion processing (Kober et al., 2008). These include
limbic structures such as the amygdala, and the ventral striatum, which is centrally
located within the basal ganglia's limbic loop.
6. Limitations of this Study
Several limitations of the present study have to be considered. First, our ¯ndings are
limited by the fact that patients with severe PD were not included in the study (H &
Y 4–5), which might be a possible explanation for the impairments of emotion recognition in PD patients. Second, all PD patients were under dopamine replacement
therapy (i.e., medication), which might also a®ect the performance in the emotion
processing (Tessitore et al., 2002) and future research is required with unmedicated
patients to reveal the actual e®ects on PD (Sprengelmeyer et al., 2003). Finally,

human emotions are dependent on number of variables such as: room temperature,
time of the day, mental activity level of the participant before recording, hormone
levels, circadian rhythms, verbalization and breathing conditions (Jerritta et al.,
2013). Though much care was to exclude these issues by allowing the participant to
choose their own free time for participating in the experiment and relax by means of
breathing exercise before start of the experiment, more care should be taken to
consider these di®erences. The impact of these di®erences on the emotional state of
the person also needs to be studied.
7. Conclusion
This study indicates that machine learning methods can aid the detection of
emotional impairment in PD patients based on EEG signals. The design of emotion elicitation protocol for inducing six basic emotional states (happiness, sadness,
fear, anger, surprise and disgust) and the data acquisition methodology were
explained in detail. EEG signals are very noise-like and complex in nature and the
required information is di±cult to extract. HOS techniques are advantageous in
gaining information about the nonlinear dynamics of the system. In this work, we
made a comparative study to classify six emotional states EEG signal (PD patients
and HC) with features derived from higher-order statistics and features derived
from second-order power spectrum. The performances of the derived features were
analyzed using two classi¯ers namely kNN and SVM. The HOS based features
yields better results of 70:10%  2:83% for PD patients and 77:29%  1:73% for
HC through beta band activity using SVM classi¯er. Besides, PD patients
achieved less accuracy in the processing of negative emotions (sadness, fear, anger
and disgust) than in processing of positive emotions (happiness, surprise) compared with HC.
Future research has to be performed to investigate other HOS features to improve
the performance of the system with respect to HC. Additional investigation pertaining to feature selection could also improve the classi¯cation performance, while
reducing computational time.
