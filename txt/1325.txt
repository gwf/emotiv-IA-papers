Abstract
Background: In recent years, neuroscientific knowledge has been applied to marketing as a novel and efficient means
to comprehend the cognitive and behavioral aspects of consumers. A number of studies have attempted to evaluate
media contents, especially TV commercials using various neuroimaging techniques such as electroencephalography
(EEG). Yet neurophysiological examination of detailed cognitive and affective responses in viewers is still required to
provide practical information to marketers. Here, this study develops a method to analyze temporal patterns of EEG
data and extract affective and cognitive indices such as happiness, surprise, and attention for TV commercial evaluation.
Methods: Twenty participants participated in the study. We developed the neurophysiological indices for TV
commercial evaluation using classification model. Specifically, these model-based indices were customized using
individual EEG features. We used a video game for developing the index of attention and four video clips for developing
indices of happiness and surprise. Statistical processes including one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) and the cross
validation scheme were used to select EEG features for each index. The EEG features were composed of the combinations
of spectral power at selected channels from the cross validation for each individual. The Fisher’s linear discriminant
classifier (FLDA) was used to estimate each neurophysiological index during viewing four different TV commercials. Post
hoc behavioral responses of preference, short-term memory, and recall were measured.
Results: Behavioral results showed significant differences for all preference, short-term memory rates, and recall rates
between commercials, leading to a ‘high-ranked’ commercial group and a ‘low-ranked’ group (P < 0.05). Neural estimation
of happiness results revealed a significant difference between the high-ranked and the low-ranked commercials
in happiness index (P < 0.01). The order of rankings based on happiness and attention matched well with the
order of behavioral response rankings. In the elapsed-time analysis of the highest-ranked commercial, we could
point to visual and auditory semantic structures of the commercial that induced increases in the happiness index.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that the neurophysiological indices developed in this study may provide
a useful tool for evaluating TV commercials.

Background
Neuroscientific findings have helped us to understand
how the brain encodes and represents the environment
and how it controls our body [1]. Several non-invasive
tools to measure neurophysiological responses have been
well developed and widely used such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) [2,3].

Advances in neuroscience have settled into our daily
lives, social practices, and even academic discourses.
Frazzetto and Anker [4] called this trend ‘Neuroculture.’
Various research fields have adopted neurotechnologies
and acquired a ‘neuro’ dimension [4], such as neuroeconomics [5], neurotheology [6], and neuroeducation [7,8].
Marketers have also sought to understand the complex
process of evaluation and buying in the human brain [9].
Conventional assessment tools to measure the effects of
marketing depend largely on personal evaluation and market analysis. These methods scarcely recognize causal interactions between marketing strategies and their impacts

on consumers’ cognitive and affective responses. In
addition, these post hoc analysis methods are often influenced by the participants’ mental state or environment at
the time of the survey. Marketers, therefore, attempt to
supplement these drawbacks and explore tactics and technologies that affect decision makers unconsciously [9].
According to Ariely and Berns [10], neuroscientific tools
could be attractive for a marketer in two ways: first, they
are cheaper and faster than current marketing methods,
and second, they offer detailed information about product
evaluation that conventional marketing methods cannot
disclose. As a result, neuromarketing, where neuroscience
and marketing meet, has emerged [11] as the application
of neuroscientific methods to analyze and understand human behavior in relation to markets and marketing exchanges [12]. Although this field has been controversial
since its birth in 2002, it has received credibility and has
been adopted by many advertising and marketing professionals, thereby growing rapidly [2]. Neurophysiological
methods, unlike conventional methods, can offer the perspectives of a diverse range of methods to evaluate the effectiveness of products, brand logos, and commercial
videos before starting the actual advertising campaign
[11]. A number of neurophysiological studies have evaluated preferences for products in terms of brand familiarity
[3,13-16]. The current research consists of ‘user design,’ a
new trend that lets consumers participate in the design of
new products and involves not only what consumers express but also what they think [10].
In neuromarketing and other neuroculture fields, recognition of the emotional states of users (or customers) has
become one of the most important themes. Affect has
played an important role in rational and intelligent behavior as well as in communication between humans [17]. Accordingly, studies seeking to identify brain regions and
frequency bands most closely related to various emotional
states are needed.
There have been several studies, especially within the last
decade, that have investigated emotion recognition and
media evaluation. For example, Lin and his colleagues classified emotional states (joy, anger, sadness, and pleasure)
from EEG dynamics together with self-reported emotional
states while listening to music [18,19]. Wang et al. [20] designed a classification system for four emotional states (joy,
relax, sadness, and fear) with EEG using movie stimuli.
Kwon and his colleagues also proposed an emotionrecognition system from movie clips using EEG. Emotions
were classified into positive or negative affections with
alpha and gamma power-band EEG features [21,22].
A number of neurophysiological studies have also
attempted to identify cognitive and affective indices of
emotion by evaluating TV contents using EEG. Reeves et
al. [23] found that the alpha band activity (interval =
0.5 s) for commercial videos had significant negative

Page 2 of 11

correlations with recall and recognition of their contents. Reeves et al. [24] reported a significant interaction
between hemisphere and emotional content of TV commercials for the frontal alpha but no interaction for the
occipital alpha. Another study on the relationship between viewers’ attention and semantically related TV
sequences showed that related and unrelated sequences
yielded significant differences in reaction time [25].
Simons et al. [26] studied a correlation between the
emotional content of TV commercials and viewers’ attention and reported that the emotional content affected
the alpha power wave in the parietal region. Smith and
Gevins [27] investigated the changes in alpha waves in
relation to changes in video structure (for example,
scene change rate) and semantic structure (for example,
emotional impact of scene) and found that recall rate
improved as the occipital alpha waves decreased when
the commercial was presented at a higher scene change
rate. Bertin et al. [28] evaluated TV commercials for the
Asahi Shimbun newspaper with EEG and showed correlations between prefrontal cortical activity and surveybased evaluations.
Most previous neurophysiological studies on TV commercials have sought for neural correlates of various
contents and evaluations of TV commercials. However,
marketers may need much diverse information from
neurophysiological research than just finding neural correlates for practical applications. For instance, it would
be useful if one can assess which parts of a TV commercial elicit positive emotional responses or attract more
attention in viewers. Therefore, the present study aims
to develop a neurophysiological method to predict the
temporal patterns of cognitive and affective states of
viewers during watching TV commercials from EEG.
Two hypotheses of the present study are formed as follows: (1) the model-based neurophysiological indices
developed using non-commercial stimuli can be applied
to evaluate TV commercials and consistent with subjective behavioral responses. (2) The temporal patterns of
the neurophysiological indices may be correlated with
the important scenes of the commercials.
Assessment of cognitive and affective states is designed
based on three indices - happiness, surprise, and attention.
In addition, to address a problem of inter-individual
variations in EEG in response to the same video stimulus,
we build a model-based assessment scheme where the
classification model translates individual EEG patterns into
normative scores for each index. To validate the neurophysiological analysis results, we also evaluate participants’
behavioral responses in terms of preference, short-term
memory, and recall and compare them with neurophysiological indices. Finally, we investigate a feasibility
of extracting parts of TV commercials that induce positive emotional responses in viewers using our model.

Methods
Ethics statement

This investigation was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided informed written consent prior to
participation with pre-approval obtained from the Institutional Review board of the Ulsan National Institute of
Science and Technology (UNISTIRB-14-01-C).
Experimental stimuli

Two sets of video stimuli and one game stimulus were
used in this experiment. The first set of video stimuli
were used to measure basic emotional states for the development of a basic neurophysiological index assessment model, while the second set consisting of TV
commercials was used to evaluate our model. The game
stimulus was used to focus participants’ attention.
For the TV commercial evaluation index development,
there were four types of video stimuli. First, a neutral
video containing green-colored scenery and nature
sounds was used as a baseline neutral stimulus. Second,
two videos were presented to induce emotional responses and to develop a happiness index in each participant; they presented the 2002 World Cup Korean
soccer game (H1) or a dozing and smiling baby (H2).

For the analysis, we selected the more appropriate video
among these two videos depending on participants’ verbal responses after viewing. Third, another pair of video
clips was presented to induce emotional responses of
surprise - these showed a new way to pour beer (S1) or
magnetic sand (S2). Again, one was selected based on
the participants’ responses. Fourth, a moving dot game
was used to focus participants’ attention [29]. In this
game, participants had to identify a dot moving at a faster speed than the other dots, which moved at a constant speed and direction. During the game, participants
were asked to indicate the dot’s location by pressing one
of four keyboard buttons (Q, W, A, or S) mapped onto
the quadrants of the screen (Figure 1). To fully engage
their attention in the game, participants were informed
that they would receive an extra reward if they achieved
the highest score.
The second set of video stimuli, used for the TV commercial evaluation, was selected from smartphone commercials released after 2013. Six commercials from different
brands were selected; they all had similar running times
(approximately 30 s). We excluded two commercials from
the most widely used brands (in Korea) to reduce the influence of attachment to a particular brand. Accordingly, four
commercials were used in this experiment (C1, C2, C3, and

C4). Each commercial has different contents and delivers
the messages in different ways. For instance, C1 emphasized the function of the rear button using the metaphor by
showing many couples with the concealed present box
behind men. Then, a message follows as, ‘We always hide
what is precious behind us.’ C2 stressed the function for
taking a picture and color variation with animated atmosphere in the kitchen in the morning. C3 was a typical informative commercial, delivering their design and
functional aspect only without any affective scenes. C4
demonstrated their characteristics such as ‘oscillatory
sound’ with the scene in the club. The volume of the
music was frequently changed according to its feature.
We collected each commercial’s data from a publically
available database (http://www.tvcf.co.kr/).

degree of purchase intention were assessed using the
Likert 7-point scale (1 ~ 7). In addition, participants were
asked to answer whether they had seen a particular commercial or not, if they had known the brand name or not,
and if they had previously purchased products of a particular brand or not. Finally, they were asked to determine
the ranking of commercials based on how well they remember. In the next day, participants determined the
ranking of commercials again based on how well they recall them after 1 day. In this study, we selected the preference for commercials, the degree of short-term memory,
recall rate, and the degree of purchase intention for further analysis. All data were analyzed using the MATLAB
program (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA).
Experimental procedure

Participants and experimental tools

Ten men and ten women (mean age 22.9 ± 1.41 years) with
normal or corrected-to-normal vision and who did not report any neurological disorders participated in this study.
During the experiment, scalp EEG signals were recorded
using a wireless EEG headset (EPOC, Emotiv Inc., San
Francisco, USA) from 14 electrodes located at AF3, F7, F3,
FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, and AF4 (in accordance with the International 10/20 system). EEG signals
were sampled at 128 Hz and referenced to the average of
the common mode sense (CMS, active electrode) and
driven right leg (DRL, passive electrode) electrodes. The
voltage between electrodes and the reference was amplified
by 60 to 100 dB of voltage gain. The impedance levels of all
of the electrodes were kept below 5 kΩ. All visual stimuli
in this experiment were presented on a 27-in. monitor
(QH270-IPSM, Achieva Korea, Incheon, Korea) positioned
at about 60 cm distance from the participants’ eyes. Auditory stimuli were presented via a speaker positioned in the
center. During the moving dot game, each participant used
the keyboard to perform the task (that is, button press). We
also used a questionnaire for the cognitive assessment and
to collect behavioral responses to the presented commercials. This questionnaire originated from previous research
[30] but was modified for the purpose of this study. We examined each participant’s preference for the commercials,
brand name, and their degree of purchase intention. The
preference for commercials was assessed by ranking each
commercial. The preference for brand name and the

Before the experiment, each participant was situated in a
comfortable chair for a few minutes. The EEG apparatus
was installed during this time, and a brief explanation
about the experiment was given. The experimental procedure consisted of five sessions in total, with four sessions for
the EEG recording and one session for the questionnaire
(Figure 2). In the first session, the green scenery picture
with the nature sounds was presented to the participants
for the neutral state condition. In the second session, we
used four emotion-inducing video stimuli (two for happiness and two for surprise) to elicit the corresponding emotions from the participants. They were asked to indicate
their emotion immediately after viewing each video clip to
confirm that the evoked emotion matched our expectation.
Participants selected their experienced emotion among
seven emotional states (Ekman’s six basic emotions [31]
plus not being classified). The rate of emotional feeling
for each stimulus was 95% for H1, 50% for H2, 55% for
S1, and 65% for S2 (H1: happiness stimulus 1, H2: happiness stimulus 2, S1: surprise stimulus 1, and S2: surprise stimulus 2). From these, we selected H1 and S2
as our basic stimuli.
In the third session, participants played the moving
dot game, which sought to focus their attention. Participants were motivated by the promise of extra rewards
for achieving the highest accuracy and completing the
game in the shortest amount of time. In the fourth session, each of four commercials was presented randomly
and participants simply viewed the commercials. In the

and recall rate indices.

final session, participants completed the questionnaire to
evaluate each commercial. They ranked their preferences
across all commercials and were asked to write down
the specific products advertised in the commercials from
memory to evaluate the short-term memory index of
each commercial. Each ranking was converted to 4, 3, 2,
and 1 points as the first, second, third, and fourth order,
respectively. One day after the experiment, participants
ranked how much they remembered from each commercial to build up a recall rate index.

happiness, neutral vs. surprise, or neutral vs. attention.
The Fisher’s linear discriminant classifier (FLDA) is a
well-known classification method to determine an optimal hyper-plane to separate the data space according to
the classes [32,33]. The FLDA aims to determine a projection vector, w, to maximize between-class scatter and
to minimize within-class scatter. The Fisher criterion
function, J(w),is then defined as follows:

Feature extraction

where:

EEG signals from 18 participants were further analyzed, as
two participants’ data were contaminated by external
noise. The EEG signals were band-pass filtered (0.5 to
100 Hz) and re-referenced to a common average reference
to reduce potential shifts due to external artifacts. Each
EEG data was split into quarter-second windows without
overlap. EEG data in each window were analyzed at six
frequency bands using short-time Fourier transform
(STFT): delta (0.5 to 4 Hz), theta (4 to 8 Hz), alpha (8 to
12 Hz), low beta (12 to 20 Hz), high beta (20 to 30 Hz),
and gamma (30 to 50 Hz). In each frequency band, the
power spectral density from the spectrogram was averaged
(frequency interval of 0.5 Hz). These steps extracted a
total of 84 features from 14 channels and 6 frequency
bands for each time window.
Feature selection

One-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) and crossvalidation were used to identify the optimal feature set for
each participant’s cognitive/affective state classification
models. Initially, 84 features were analyzed with separate
one-way ANOVAs. Neural features collected for each of
happiness, surprise, and attention were compared with
those collected from the neutral session. From the results
of ANOVAs, the first optimal feature with the highest Fvalue was selected. Along with this first feature, the next
feature was selected with which classification accuracy
through a tenfold cross-validation was maximized. This
subsequent feature selection procedure based on tenfold
cross-validation was repeated until its accuracy began to
decrease. This process was performed for each participant
and each neurophysiological index. Accordingly, the sizes
of the optimal feature set differed between participants
and neurophysiological indices. Finally, we obtained three
EEG feature sets for each participant: neutral-happiness,
neutral-surprise, and neutral-attention.
Classification analysis

Upon finding the optimal feature set for each cognitive
or emotional state, the state classifier model was trained
to classify brain signals into one of two states: neutral vs.

vector (w) is the vector that maximizes J(w).
The trained classifiers were used to estimate state variations during watching TV commercials. The EEG signals
for each commercial were divided into a series of segments (window length: 0.25 s), and the features sets were
selected for each segment. The classifiers were applied to
the features, yielding a posterior probability of estimating
a particular cognitive or emotional state. These posterior
probabilities were used as neurophysiological indices for
temporal patterns of happiness, surprise, and attention.
The average of these indices were calculated and compared across the commercials. Finally, the commercials
were subjected to an elapsed-time analysis in terms of the
scene and auditory structures.

Results
Optimal feature set

We examined how many times each feature (a combination of frequency and channel) was selected across all
participants. Figure 3 shows the accumulated number of
selecting each feature. It shows that EEG features with
the high frequencies were more likely to be selected for
the happiness and surprise indices.
We also compared the average of feature dimensions and
cross-validation accuracy across neurophysiological indices.
Figure 4 shows the average number of optimal feature sets
and the accuracy of the cross-validation among the three
neurophysiological indices. The number of features was
7.67 ± 0.70 for happiness, 7.33 ± 0.49 for surprise, and
7.44 ± 0.66 for attention. Average cross-validation accuracy
was 87.22% ± 1.40% for happiness, 85.77% ± 1.8% for

no significant differences in the number of features or
cross-validation accuracy between neurophysiological
indices (P > 0.05).
Behavioral responses

The post hoc survey results showed that the preference
rating was 3.17 ± 0.79 for C1, 2.28 ± 0.96 for C2, 1.67 ±
1.03 for C3, and 2.89 ± 1.13 for C4. Also, the shortterm memory rate was 2.94 ± 1.35 for C1, 2.00 ± 0.69
for C2, 1.83 ± 1.10 for C3, and 3.17 ± 0.79 for C4; and
the recall rate was 3.39 ± 0.85 for C1, 1.78 ± 1.00 for
C2, 1.89 ± 0.68 for C3, and 2.94 ± 1.06 for C4. The statistical analysis results showed that the preference rating
of C1 was higher than those of C2 and C3 (P < 0.05)
and the preference rating of C4 was higher than that of
C3 (P < 0.05). Also, the short-term memory rates of

both C1 and C2 were higher than those of both C3 and
C4 (P < 0.05). Similarly, the memory recall rates of both
C1 and C2 were higher than those of both C3 and C4
(P < 0.05). No difference of the behavioral responses between C1 and C4 was found. Figure 5a illustrates a
comparison of the behavioral responses (preference rating, short-term memory rate, and recall rate) for the
four commercials (C1, C2, C3, and C4). The rankings
of each index were determined as C1 > C4 > C2 > C3 for
the preference rating, C4 > C1 > C2 > C3 for the shortterm memory rate, and C1 > C4 > C3 > C2 for the recall
rate. Participants were also asked to respond their purchase intention on each commercial. The scale was 1
(never purchase) to 7 (certainly purchase). The average
rating was 3.72 ± 1.53 for C1, 2.17 ± 1.25 for C2, 1.83 ±
1.47 for C3, and 3.61 ± 1.69 for C4. The ranking of
commercials in terms of the degree of purchase intention

neurophysiological indices; C1 and C4 were significantly
higher than both C2 and C3.
Neurophysiological indices

Figure 5b shows a comparison of the neurophysiological
indices (happiness, surprise, and attention) between the
four commercials. The indices were normalized to values
between −1 and 1, where larger positive numbers indicate
that the corresponding emotion was induced more
strongly. Happiness index was 0.23 ± 0.39 for C1, −0.1 ±
0.4 for C2, −0.09 ± 0.27 for C3, and −0.01 ± 0.33 for C4.
Surprise index was −0.13 ± 0.43 for C1, −0.01 ± 0.38 for
C2, 0.10 ± 0.30 for C3, and −0.03 ± 0.42 for C4; and attention index was −0.03 ± 0.31 for C1, 0.00 ± 0.35 for

C2, −0.05 ± 0.25 for C3, and 0.11 ± 0.38 for C4. The happiness index of C1 was greater than those of C2 (P < 0.05)
and C3 (P < 0.01). Besides this, there was no significant difference between any pair of indices. The ranking with the
averages of each index was C1 > C4 > C3 > C2 for happiness, C3 > C2 > C4 > C1 for surprise, and C4 > C2 > C1 >
C3 for attention, respectively (Table 1).
Elapsed-time analysis

The neurophysiological indices were analyzed as a function of elapsed time. Figure 6 shows the happiness index
averaged across participants for C1 along with audio
structures. From the temporal patterns of the happiness
index, we chose several examples of the scenes in the
TV commercial (C1), which corresponded to the average

scenes illustrated example parts of a TV commercial that
mostly induced happiness emotion in participants. In
particular, the fourth example showing a written message
on the black background was recognized as a breaking
point in terms of the audio stream where a sudden pause
of music was placed, being quite different from other
scenes in the commercial.

Discussion
EEG features for TV commercial development indices

Subject-independent features were selected using ANOVA
and tenfold cross-validation. The number of feature dimensions differed by participant and index. For each participant, the regional features varied but some features
were shared (Figure 2). The happiness index was related to
the high-frequency band (>20 Hz) in the right frontocentral (FC5) and right temporal sites (T8). For the surprise index, the gamma band (30 to 50 Hz) in the
prefrontal site (AF3) was dominant, followed by high beta
and gamma bands of the left temporal site (T7), the
gamma band in the occipital site (O2), and the delta band
in the left frontal sites (F3 and F7). For the attention index,
the high beta band of the left prefrontal site (AF3) was
dominant. Previous studies [34,35] found that EEG beta activity in both temporal and parietal regions was associated
with emotional valence. Other studies have also shown that
temporal cortical activity was related to the distinction between positive and negative emotions [36,37]. The observed features of the present study are in line with these
previous results.

Behavioral and neurophysiological indices

Based on the behavioral data, the commercials were divided into two groups according to the ranking of behavioral indices: a ‘high-ranked’ (1 and 4) and a ‘low-ranked’ (2
and 3) commercial groups. There were no significant differences in behavioral responses within each group, but
commercials differed significantly when compared between
groups. As for the neurophysiological indices, the happiness index showed significant differences between commercials. C1 differed significantly from both C2 and C3 in
the happiness index. C4 showed a relatively higher attention index than the commercials in the ‘low-ranked’ group.
These results demonstrate that the neurophysiological indices of happiness and attention developed in this study
may be used to evaluate TV commercials.
The population ratings were available in the public database we obtained our TV commercials used in the study.
The population rating of each commercial (based on 5point scale) was 3.77 for C1, 3.12 for C2, 2.91 for C3, and
3.57 for C4. Interestingly, the ranking of population ratings among these for commercials is quite consistent with
the subjective ratings and neurophysiological indices in
our study. This shows that the neurophysiological indices
developed in a small group (18 people in our case), as validated with group behavioral responses, may be generalized
to a large population [38]. It also implies that it may be
possible to expect the response of population with the result from a small group of participants.
It is noteworthy that the ranking for the surprise index
showed the opposite order to the other indices. Although
there were no significant differences between the commercials, the surprise index order was completely reversed: C3
received the highest score while C1 received the lowest.

Yang et al. Journal of Physiological Anthropology (2015) 34:19

This effect is likely due to the specific meaning of ‘surprise’
and will be covered in the last part of the ‘Discussion’ section (that is, ‘Limitations and future research’ subsection).
Elapsed-time analysis

Each commercial can be characterized by a specific
combination of scene changes, music, characters, and
captions. This complicates the analysis of commercials.
We therefore needed to analyze commercials as function
of elapsed time. As an example for this elapsed-time
analysis, we examined C1 in terms of the happiness
index, that is, we analyzed the time points at which the
happiness index reached the highest values during the
commercial. During C1, the happiness index oscillated
continuously but there were some clear peaks: PP1, PP2,
PP3, and PP4. During PP1, an old couple was depicted
wherein the man was hiding flowers from the woman.
During PP2, a young couple was playing on the bed
while another man hid in the background. During PP3, a
newlywed couple and another man in hiding were presented. Considering that the other scenes have only one
man or a family (father and daughter) present rather
than a couple, it is plausible that happiness was induced
when participants view the scenes of happy couples. The
final peak point (PP4) differed slightly; the scene consisted of a black background, a smartphone, and some
text. Although there were no special components in this
scene, the musical stream was distinct. In the scene between 14 and 15 s - right before PP4 - there was a ‘ding’
sound (that is, similar to a bicycle horn). After this tone,
sudden silence accompanied the appearance of a picture
of the advertised smartphone and a message (in Korean)
‘We always hide what is precious behind us’ on a black
background, after which the aforementioned sound was
heard again (17 to 18 s). In the study of Gomez and
Danuser [39], a relationship between musical structures
and valence and arousal was discussed. Also, the relationship between auditory stimuli and emotion has been
studied by others [40-42] and significant correlations
have been demonstrated. These support a conjecture
that the auditory structure of C1 might induce a greater
happiness index.
Applications to design advertisements

Our study proposed a neurophysiological method to evaluate TV commercials. However, it can also be used to design
a TV commercial as well before its release. In particular,
the design process of TV commercials may take advantage
of the proposed method in the following ways: First, as our
method employs simple basic stimuli irrelevant to TV
commercials in the development of neurophysiological indices, one can flexibly apply this method to any commercial clips during the design stage; second, it is typically
difficult to estimate the response of populations to a TV

commercial in advance before its release. But the present
study implies that one can use our method to evaluate a
designed ad before release and predict population responses; third, the possibility of temporal analysis of video
streams using our method would help designers look into
individual scenes and improve their film editing, which is
generally not possible with post hoc verbal-based methods.
Hence, together with traditional survey-based methods,
the proposed neurophysiological method may provide additional merits, especially for both the design and evaluation
of TV commercials.
Limitations and future research

Our study used preset video clips and a game to induce
specific cognitive or emotional states. Although we used
two stimuli for each emotion and selected the stimulus
based on the participants’ response, the chosen stimuli
might not have induced a ‘true’ emotion in the participants. Specifically, a participant might have admitted that
he or she was happy even when he or she may not have
actually felt as such. Furthermore, a participant may not
have been in a ‘neutral’ emotional state when he or she
viewed the neutral picture with nature sounds. Similarly,
‘surprise’ can have different and diverse meanings for each
participant. When two people simultaneously view the
same product, one of them might be surprised by the
product’s functions while the other might be surprised by
its shape. Therefore, stimuli for eliciting emotional and
neutral states that vary less with participant characteristics
are needed for future studies. Many studies have extracted
neurophysiological indices for emotion from EEG data but
have yielded different findings [18-22,28]. Thus, research
attempting to standardize neurophysiological indices for
evaluating media, including TV commercials, is necessary.
In the current study, we focused on EEG features
(channels and frequency bands) but other analyses can
be adopted, for example, phase synchronization or spectral coherence. A previous study [28] argued that ‘EEG
and other biometric methods should not be used as a replacement of verbal-based methods, but as a supplement.’ However, it is certain that neurophysiological
methods give us more information that cannot be obtained from the verbal-based methods. We presented
some examples of application to design the advertisements. With the high-quality integration between different methods, neurophysiological method will show its
true utility.

Conclusions
Our study evaluated four TV commercials using neurophysiological (EEG) and conventional survey-based
methods. From both measurements, two types of indices
were derived: neurophysiological indices (happiness, surprise, and attention) and behavioral indices (preference

Yang et al. Journal of Physiological Anthropology (2015) 34:19

rate, short-term memory rate, and recall rate). To extract
the neurophysiological indices, optimal spectral features
from EEG were extracted using statistical and classification
models. Behavioral indices showed significant differences
between commercials, especially when the commercials
were divided into ‘high-ranked’ and ‘low-ranked’ groups.
The corresponding neurophysiological index matched the
behavioral findings. The happiness index in particular
showed significant differences between ‘high-ranked’ and
the ‘low-ranked’ groups. The elapsed-time analysis demonstrated that scene and auditory components affected the
neurophysiological indices. Although significant differences
between commercials were only found for the happiness
index, the ranking of the four commercials in terms of
neurophysiological indices showed a similar pattern to the
behavioral ranking. The elapsed-time analysis further revealed the utility of the structural and contextual analysis
method used herein. The current study demonstrates a
new scheme of evaluating media content, particularly for
TV commercials.
