Introduction

This article presents a revised and extended version of a paper presented at the World
Congress on Engineering and Computer Science 2011, International Conference on
Signal Processing and Imaging Engineering (Ramı́rez-Cortes et al. 2010). In recent
years, there has been a growing interest in the research community on signal
processing techniques oriented to solve the multiple challenges involved in Brain
Computer Interfaces (BCI) applications (Paul et al. 2008; Theodore et al. 2007;
Bashashati et al. 2007). Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are systems which allow
people to control some devices using their brain signals. An important motivation to
develop BCI systems, among some others, would be to allow an individual with
motor disabilities to have control over specialized devices such as computers, speech
synthesizers, assistive appliances or neural prostheses. A dramatic relevance arises
when thinking about patients with severe motor disabilities such as locked-in syndrome, which can be caused by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, high-level spinal cord
injury or brain stem stroke. In its most severe form people are not able to move any
limb. BCIs would increase an individual’s independence, leading to an improved
quality of life and reduced social costs. Among the possible brain monitoring
methods for BCI purposes, the EEG constitutes a suitable alternative because of its
good time resolution, relative simplicity and noninvasiveness when compared to
other methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission
tomography (PET), magnetoencephalography or electrocorticogram systems.
There are several signals which can be extracted from the EEG in order to develop
BCI systems, including the slow cortical potential (Bashashati et al. 2007), m and b

rhythms (Royer et al. 2009; Delaram et al. 2009), motor imagery (Thomas et al.
2009), static-state visually evoked potentials (Zhu et al. 2010; Christian et al. 2009),
or P300 evoked potentials (David 2005; Seno et al. 2010; Brice et al. 2006). P300
evoked potentials occur with latency around 300 ms in response to target stimuli
that occur unexpectedly. In a P300 controlled experiment, subjects are usually
instructed to respond in a specific way to some stimuli, which can be auditory,
visual, or somatosensory. P300 signals come from the central-parietal region of the
brain and can be found more or less throughout the EEG on a number of channels.
The P300 is an important signature of cognitive processes such as attention and
working memory and an important clue in the field of neurology to study mental
disorders and other psychological disfunctionalities (Kun et al. 2009).
In this work, an experiment on P-300 rhythm detection using wavelet-based
feature extraction, and an ANFIS algorithm is presented. The experiment has been
designed in such a way that the P300 signals are generated when the subject is
exposed to some visual stimuli, consisting of a sequential group of slides with a
landscape background. Images of a ship are inserted using a controlled non-uniform
sequence, and the subject is asked to press a button when the ship unexpectedly
appears. The EEG signals are preprocessed using an Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) algorithm, and the P300 is located in a time-frequency plane
using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with a sub-band coding scheme.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 27.2 presents the theory
associated to the wavelet sub-band coding algorithm. Section 27.3 describes Independent Component Analysis (ICA) as part of the pre-processing stage. Section 27.4
reports the evoked potential experiment and the proposed method on P300 signal
detection. Section 27.5 describes the ANFIS model and its application to the EEG
signals. Section 27.6 presents obtained results, and Sect. 27.7 presents some
concluding remarks, perspectives, and future direction of this research oriented to
the implementation of a BCI system.

27.2

Discrete Wavelet Transform

The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is a transformation that can be used to
analyze the temporal and spectral properties of non-stationary signals. The DWT is
defined by the following equation (Priestley 2008):
Wð j; kÞ ¼

XX
j

f ðxÞ2j=2 cð2j x  kÞ

(27.1)

k

The set of functions cj;k ðnÞis referred to as the family of wavelets derived from
cðnÞ, which is a time function with finite energy and fast decay called the mother
wavelet. The basis of the wavelet space corresponds then, to the orthonormal
functions obtained from the mother wavelet after scale and translation operations.

The definition indicates the projection of the input signal into the wavelet
space through the inner product, then, the function f(x) can be represented in the
form:

where dj(k) are the wavelet coefficients at level j. The coefficients at different levels
can be obtained through the projection of the signal into the wavelets family as
expressed in Eqs. 27.3 and 27.4.

The DWT analysis can be performed using a fast, pyramidal algorithm described
in terms of multi-rate filter banks. The DWT can be viewed as a filter bank with
octave spacing between filters. Each sub-band contains half the samples of the
neighboring higher frequency sub-band. In the pyramidal algorithm the signal is
analyzed at different frequency bands with different resolution by decomposing the
signal into a coarse approximation and detail information. The coarse approximation is then further decomposed using the same wavelet decomposition step. This is
achieved by successive high-pass and low-pass filtering of the time signal and a
down-sampling by two (Pinsky et al. 2009), as defined by the following Eqs. 27.5
and 27.6:
aj ðkÞ ¼

Figure 27.1 shows a two-level filter bank. Signals aj(k), and dj(k) are known as
approximation and detail coefficients, respectively.

This process may be executed iteratively forming a wavelet decomposition tree
up to any desired resolution level. In this work the analysis was carried out up to
the 11 decomposition level (16 s windows with sampling frequency of 128 sps)
applied on the signals separated from the ICA process described in the next
section.

27.3

Preprocessing of Eeg Signals Using Independent
Component Analysis

Independent Component Analysis (ICA), an approach to the problem known as
Blind Source Separation (BSS), is a widely used method for separation of mixed
signals (Amar et al. 2008; Keralapura et al. 2011). The signals xi ðtÞare assumed to
be the result of linear combinations of the independent sources, as expressed in
Eq. 27.7.
xi ðtÞ ¼ ai1 si ðtÞ þ ai2 s2 ðtÞ þ    þ ain sn ðtÞ

(27.7)

x ¼ As

(27.8)

or in matrix form:

where A is a matrix containing mixing parameters and S the source signals. The goal
of ICA is to calculate the original source signals from the mixture by estimating a
de-mixing matrix U that gives:
_

s ¼ Ux

(27.9)

This method is called blind because both the mixing matrix A and the matrix
containing the sources S are unknown, i.e., little information is available. The demixing matrix U is found by optimizing a cost function. Several different cost
functions can be used for performing ICA, e.g. kurtosis, negentropy, etc., therefore, different methods exist to estimate U. For that purpose the source signals are
assumed to be non-gaussian and statistically independent. The requirement of
non-gaussianity stems from the fact that ICA relies on higher order statistics to
separate the variables, and higher order statistics of Gaussian signals are zero
(John 2008).
EEG consists of measurements of a set of N electric potential differences
between pairs of scalp electrodes. Then the N-dimensional set of recorded signals
can be viewed as one realization of a random vector process. ICA consists in
looking for an overdetermined (N  P) mixing matrix A (where P is smaller than
or equal to N) and a P-dimensional source vector process whose components are the
most statistically independent as possible. In the case of the P300 experiment

described in this paper, ICA is applied with two objectives; denoising the EEG signal
in order to enhance the signal to noise ratio of the P-300, and separating the evoked
potential from some artifacts, like myoelectric signals derived from eye-blinking,
breathing, or head motion.

27.4

Experimental Setup and Proposed Methodology
for P-300 Signal Detection

In this work the EPOC headset, recently released by the Emotiv Company, has been
used (Emotiv Systems Inc.). This headset consists of 14 data-collecting electrodes
and 2 reference electrodes, located and labeled according to the international 10–20
system (John 2008). Following the international standard, the available locations
are: AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8 and AF4. The EEG
signals are transmitted wirelessly in the frequency of 2.4 GHz to a laptop computer.
This experiment consists of presenting a non-persistent image to cause a P300
response from the user. The block diagram of the system to evoke and capture P300
signals, and a picture of the described setup are shown in Figs. 27.2 and 27.3,
respectively. The subject is resting in a comfortably position during the testing.
A simple graphical application shows in the screen a starship attacking a neighborhood in a fixed time sequence not known by the subject, as represented in
Table 27.1. Recognition of the ship by the subject, when it suddenly appears in
the screen, is expected to generate a P300 evoked potential in the brain central zone.
The serial port is used for sending time markers to the Emotive testbench, in
synchrony with the moments when the ship appears in the screen. The Testbench
application provided by Emotiv System Co., is used to capture raw data from the 14
electrodes, as shown in Fig. 27.4.

Fig. 27.5 ANFIS structure

The operations proposed to detect the P300 rhythm are summarized in the block
diagram of Fig. 27.5. First, a band-pass filter selects the required frequency
components and cancels the DC value. Then, ICA blind source separation is applied
with the purpose of denoising the EEG signal and separating the evoked potential
from artifacts, like myoelectric signals derived from eye-blinking, breathing, or
head motion, as well as cardiac signals.
The P300 is further located in time and scale through a wavelet sub-band coding
scheme. This information is further fed into an Adaptive Neurofuzzy Inference
System (ANFIS), as described in the next section.

27.5

Adaptive Neurofuzzy Inference System

Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) combine the learning
capabilities of neural networks with the approximate reasoning of fuzzy inference
algorithms. Embedding a fuzzy inference system in the structure of a neural
network has the benefit of using known training methods to find the parameters
of a fuzzy system. Specifically, ANFIS uses a hybrid learning algorithm to identify
the membership function parameters of Takagi-Sugeno type fuzzy inference
systems. In this work, the ANFIS model included in the MATLAB toolbox has
been used for experimentation purposes. A combination of least-squares and
backpropagation gradient descent methods is used for training the FIS membership
function parameters to model a given set of input/output data through a multilayer
neural network. ANFIS systems have been recently used for optimization,
modeling, prediction, and signal detection, among others (Douglas et al. 2004;
Chang and Chang 2006; Subasi 2007). In this paper, the ANFIS system is proposed
to be used for the detection of the P-300 rhythm in an EEG signal, for BCI
applications. Frequency bands with the most significant energy content, in the

Fig. 27.7 Gaussian membership functions corresponding to the input B1

range of the P-300 signal, are selected from the wavelet decomposition, as the input
for the ANFIS system. These bands are 8–4, 4–2, 2–1, and 1–0.5 Hz, which are
considered as the linguistic variables B1, B2, B3 and B4, respectively. The ANFIS
structure is depicted in Fig. 27.6. Figure 27.7 shows the control surfaces
corresponding to inputs B1 and B2 related to the output. Figure 27.7 shows the
input Gaussian membership functions for input B1.

Fig. 27.8 ANFIS output and triangle pulses

The ANFIS is used to map the P300 signal composition to a triangle pulse
occurring simultaneously during the training stage. Figure 27.8 shows the ANFIS
output following triangle pulses after a 400 epochs training. A trained ANFIS is
further used during a verification stage, using the EEG signals obtained from eight
test subjects performing the same experiment with 10 trials of 16 s each.

27.6

Results

The captured signals were analyzed using a time window of 16 s, with a sampling
frequency of 128 samples per second. Figure 27.9 shows the 14 electrodes raw
signals obtained from the emotive headset. As described before, a band-pass
filtering stage is applied to the raw data. Figure 27.10 shows information from the
electrodes T8, FC6, F4, F8 and AF4 signals, after the filter is applied.
The P300 signals are predominant in the brain central area, thus the P300 is
typically measured from the Pz, Cz, Fz electrodes. The Emotive headset does not
include specific electrodes over the brain central area, however, the headset can be
positioned in such a way that the electrodes AF3, AF4, F3, and F4, are able to
collect the EEG signals relevant to the P300 experiment described in this work. The
EEG signals obtained from the 14 electrodes are then processed through the ICA
algorithm. The 14 channels are shown in Fig. 27.11. Typically, the P300 signals are
embedded in artifacts, and they appear in two different channels; in this case
channel 2 and 3. After the blind source separation applied to electrodes AF3,
AF4, F3, and F4 signals, it can be noticed that P300 signals are visible on channel 2,
while the others separated channels show some artifacts such as the myoelectric
signal from blinking, which is predominant in AF3 and AF4 electrodes, cardiac
rhythm, and system noise. The signals obtained after the ICA separation, are shown
in Fig. 27.12.

A time-scale analysis in the wavelet domain was then performed in order to
locate the energy peaks corresponding to the P300 rhythm. DWT sub-band coding
with 11 decomposition levels, using a Daubechies-4 wavelet was applied to channel
2, as shown in Fig. 27.13. It can be seen that the P300 peaks are easily distinguished
in the wavelet domain. The energy peaks in the scalogram of Fig. 27.13, are located
in the bands 0.5–1 Hz and 1–2 Hz, as expected. It was noted that P300 rhythms were
distinguished better in the EEG signals corresponding to the eight first events in the
experiment. After that time lapse, the experiment became tedious for most of the
users, with the consequence of generating low-level P300 signals, undetectable in
the experiments. Figure 27.14 shows a typical obtained signal, corresponding to the
detection of P300 rhythms, as the output of the ANFIS system. Table 27.2
summarizes the total detection accuracy obtained with the proposed system.

27.7

Concluding Remarks

This paper presented an experiment on P300-rhythm detection based on ICA-based
blind source separation, wavelet analysis, and an ANFIS model. The results
presented in this paper are part of a project with the ultimate goal of designing
and developing brain computer interface systems. These experiments support the
feasibility to detect P300 events using the Emotiv headset through an ANFIS
approach. The proposed method is suitable for integration into a brain-computer
interface, under a proper control paradigm. DWT coefficients could be used further
as input to a variety of classifiers using different techniques, such as distance-based,
k-nearest neighbor or Support Vector Machines (SVM).
