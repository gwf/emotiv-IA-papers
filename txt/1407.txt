ABSTRACT
SEBASTIAN T. KOENIG. Individualized VR Rehabilitation after Brain Injuries
Context-sensitive cognitive rehabilitation aims to address the specific deficits of
patients by taking into account the unique strengths and weaknesses of each braininjured individual. However, this approach requires customized assessments and
trainings that are difficult to validate, time-consuming or simply unavailable for
daily clinical use. Given the currently struggling economy and an increasing
number of patients with brain injuries, a feasible and efficient solution for this
individualized rehabilitation concept is needed.
This dissertation addresses the development and evaluation of a VE-based
training and assessment for context-sensitive cognitive rehabilitation. The proposed
application is designed to closely resemble real-world places that are relevant to
each individual neurological patient. Despite such an ecologically valid approach to
rehabilitation, the application also integrates traditional process-specific tasks that
offer potential for standardization and collection of normative data across patient
populations.
Three cognitive tasks (navigation, orientation, spatial memory) have been
identified for use in individualized VEs. In three experimental trials the feasibility
and validity of the technological implementation and theoretical foundation of these
tasks has been assessed. In a fourth trial one of the tasks has been used for the
rehabilitation of a brain-injured patient. Based on the results of these studies a
workflow for the rapid development of VEs has been established which allows a VR
developer to provide clinicians with individualized cognitive tasks. In addition,
promising results for the clinical use and validation of the proposed system form the
basis for future randomized controlled clinical trials.
In conclusion, this dissertation elaborates how context-sensitive and processspecific rehabilitation approaches each offer a unique perspective on cognitive
rehabilitation and how combining both through the means of VR technology may
offer new opportunities to further this clinical discipline.

1. INTRODUCTION
This dissertation was written with readers of medical or engineering backgrounds
in mind. Topics of neuropsychology, rehabilitation and software engineering are
discussed at various levels of detail throughout this dissertation. The proposed
framework is largely beneficial for clinicians and therapists with interest in VR
rehabilitation. However, the described approach requires a multidisciplinary team
to implement individualized VR rehabilitation in a clinical setting. A software
engineer, 3D modeler or technical artist is required to create the individualized
scenarios which are used by clinicians to treat and assess cognitive deficits in braininjured patients.

1.1 Rehabilitation
Brain injuries often have a lasting impact on a person’s life, preventing the
individual to live independently and engage in activities of daily life. Rehabilitation
seeks to ameliorate cognitive and motor functions after brain injury, but even after
prolonged, intense training many patients are left with persisting deficits. Brain
injuries such as cerebrovascular diseases and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are
among the most common causes of death and long-lasting disability in several
countries around the world (Johnston, Mendis, & Mathers, 2009). After cancer and
heart disease, stroke is the most common cause of death in countries such as the
UK, USA, Germany, and New Zealand. Estimated costs for acute and long-term
care after brain injuries are among the highest for any health-care related costs in
many countries. For example, annual costs for stroke are estimated to be $62.7
billion in the USA, £4.5 billion in the UK, and NZD157 million in New Zealand.
Similarly, direct and indirect costs for TBI were valued to be $60 billion in the USA
in 2000. Taking demographic models into account, rehabilitation is going to play an
even more important role in the future. Population estimates in developed countries
predict a sharp decline of the so-called elderly support ratio (Population Reference
Bureau, 2010). This ratio quantifies the number of people aged 15-65 years, divided
by the number of people aged 65 or older. Consequently, more elderly people are
going to seek support through health-care systems around the world. With such
substantial impact of brain injuries on the quality of life of millions of people and on
economies worldwide, further research into cost-effective and efficient treatments
for brain diseases is of high importance.
The heterogeneity of impairments that neurological patients suffer from is a
relevant factor for developing and evaluating treatments. Cognitive impairments
are a common result of TBI, stroke, cerebral tumors, neurodegenerative diseases
(e.g. Parkinson’s disease), and many other brain diseases (Vakhnina, Nikitina,
Parfenov, & Yakhno, 2009). The severity of each incident largely depends on the
size and location of the brain lesion and the individual circumstances of the patient.
Age, gender and the existence of risk factors play an important role for the
incidence, progression and recurrence of brain diseases. Further, the individual
circumstances of each patient are usually taken into account when rehabilitation is
planned and carried out. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability

1

and Health (World Health Organization, 2001) combines social and medical aspects
for clinical treatment and considers the individual’s impairments, participation in
society, and contextual and environmental factors. With such a unique perspective
on each patient’s case, clinical teams can better understand the problems which
need to be solved during rehabilitation. Ylvisaker (2003; 2006) describes this
approach as context-sensitive rehabilitation and makes a direct comparison to more
traditional process-specific cognitive rehabilitation. Process-specificity refers to the
cognitive domains of memory, attention and executive function as a basis for
cognitive rehabilitation (Sohlberg & Mateer, 2001, p. 7/8). Cognitive deficits in
subdomains such as divided attention, short-term memory and executive function
are identified during rehabilitation and trained specifically with repetitive use of
cognitive tasks. In contrast, context-sensitive rehabilitation takes the impairments
of an individual and puts them in the social and functional context of the patient.
Cognitive domains are still used to identify impairments, but are then brought into
a framework of the individual’s participation in society. When Ylvisaker (2003)
compares his context-sensitive approach to process-specific rehabilitation, he refers
to Sohlberg and Mateer (1989) who describe several distinct cognitive domains and
therapeutic approaches for each domain. However, both rehabilitation concepts
don’t have to be mutually exclusive. In Sohlberg and Mateer’s (2001) updated book,
the authors put more emphasis on an integrated approach which also includes the
individual circumstances of the patient. The authors stress the importance of the
patient’s integration into a wider community, the priority of function over deficits,
and the focus on generalization of rehabilitation tasks, all of which are at the core of
Ylvisaker’s work. When both concepts are combined, they provide a more
comprehensive framework. Cognitive domains are the basis for task-specific,
generalizable training which is relevant to the patient’s context. Moreover, the
patient’s individual strengths and weaknesses, the social background and a focus on
participation complement the underlying models of cognitive science. Ylvisaker
directly compares traditional and context-sensitive rehabilitation and lists
assessments and treatments for both. While standard neuropsychological measures
are mentioned for both approaches, the author asks for flexibility during
assessment and treatment and suggests observation and exploration to take the
individual context of the patient into account. However, questions arise on how the
standardized nature of many traditional assessments fit into Ylvisaker’s concept.
His individual approach to rehabilitation demands sophisticated tools that also
meet the specific needs of brain-injured individuals. Standard neuropsychological
tests and trainings are suitable to test domain-specific cognitive skills, but often
may not account for the unique situation of the patient. In order to develop tasks for
an individual rehabilitation approach, several aspects regarding their development,
validity and clinical use need to be considered.

1.2 Development
In most developed countries health care spending increases at a faster rate than
economic growth. Specifically, total health care expenditure as percentage of the
gross domestic product has been rising substantially over the last decades (Kaiser
Family Foundation, 2011b). Considering this constant rise in health care
expenditure (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2011a) in addition to a recent global
economic recession, cost-effectiveness has to be of high importance for development
and administration of rehabilitative treatments. However, individualized
rehabilitation tasks imply a higher cost of creating unique content for each patient.
Gathering information about the individual context of the patient requires
additional resources. Using such information to provide flexible tasks and training
content is even more costly. An individualized set of tasks is not a single
development effort, but rather an ongoing adjustment and content generation for
each patient. Thus, reusable content that can be adjusted for the individual context
of the patient appears to be a cost-effective solution. For example, task-specific
trainings can be created for a variety of scenarios, as long as they are flexible
enough to guarantee a relevant experience for each patient. In summary, a balance
has to be found between operating costs across brain-injured patients and a high
degree of flexibility and relevance for each patient.

1.3 Validity
Generally, the validity of a test “[...] refers to the degree to which evidence and
theory support the interpretations of test scores entailed by proposed uses of the
test” (APA, NCME, & AERA, 1999). Specifically, a valid cognitive task provides
information about the cognitive functions of a patient. This information is used to
draw conclusions about the patient’s ability to live independently, return to work,
and engage in activities of daily life. However, individualized rehabilitation tasks
and traditional neuropsychological tasks seem to differ substantially in respect to
different aspects of validity. Several concepts that contribute to the overall validity
of a test have been reported in the methodological literature, each separating
traditional and context-sensitive tasks.
External validity describes the extent to which task results can be
generalized across different settings and situations (Cook & Campbell, 1979).
However, the reason for using individualized tasks is not to generalize task results
across a wider population or across less meaningful situations. Rather, the clinician
attempts to create a unique experience with relevant situations for each individual.
Transfer of skills from these unique experiences to a variety of daily-life settings is
highly desirable, though it is not always achievable (Ylvisaker, 2003).
Several clinical trials attempted to demonstrate such skill transfer with
traditional rehabilitation methods, but results have been mixed. For example, BenYishay and colleagues (1987) found specific training effects for a training of 40
brain-injured patients using their Orientation Remedial Module (ORM). In a subsample of eleven patients, only specifically trained attention domains improved
while other untrained domains did not improve. Moreover, the authors were able to
show (mostly weak) relationships between the patients’ performance on the ORM
and activities of daily life.
Cicerone and colleagues (2000) conclude in their literature review that
cognitive rehabilitation should generally be directed towards improving everyday
functioning. However, only few of the reviewed studies showed any transfer towards
the daily life of patients. Some evidence was found for visuospatial rehabilitation,
language and communication training and training of compensatory memory
strategies.
In an updated review, Cicerone and colleagues (2005) come to similar
conclusions and summarize that strategy training generally appears superior to
targeting specific skills, especially for memory and attention training. The authors
note that future research and clinical practice should pay close attention to
functional outcomes and the participation of patients in their social context, rather
than train and evaluate patient performance at the impairment level. As in their
previous review, evidence for skill transfer to daily activities is scarce.
Geusgens et al. (2007) reviewed 41 studies specifically looking for transfer
effects during cognitive rehabilitation. They only included studies that trained
compensation strategies as opposed to cognitive skills training. They refer to
4

existing studies that strategy training (i.e. compensating behaviors) is more likely
to evoke transfer to the patients’ everyday life than directly training the deficient
cognitive domain (Cicerone, et al., 2005; Wilson, 2000). Out of the 41 reviewed
studies, 36 were able to demonstrate some form of transfer. However, only 22
studies actually evaluated transfer to daily-life activities while the others looked at
either simulated lab-based activities or activities that were very similar to the
previously trained ones. Out of these 22 studies, 18 were able to show transfer of
learned abilities, but only six included statistical evidence for their results.
Furthermore, the sample sizes of most studies were very small or based on singlecase designs. Consequently, no clear-cut conclusions for or against strategy training
transfer to daily activities can be drawn.
In summary, generalization of skills during cognitive rehabilitation towards
daily-life settings has only received little support in the literature. More specifically,
task-focused training appears to show no transfer to situations outside of the
training situation and the effectiveness of strategy training requires further
evidence. While the external validity of training applications seems to be of central
importance to the patients’ success in their daily life, most traditional rehabilitation
studies have not successfully demonstrated such transfer yet. Even though
principles of context-sensitive rehabilitation have been mentioned in several
literature reviews (Cicerone, et al., 2005), context-sensitivity is often not associated
with transfer to activities of daily life. This is because context-sensitive tasks are
essentially based on the unique experiences that a patient has in his daily life.
Hence, a transfer is often not necessary as training tasks are either identical to
common daily chores or replicate them as closely as possible. Nonetheless, when
traditional process-specific tasks are combined with individualized context, task
generalization across similar daily activities seems to be of relevance.
Internal validity is concerned about the causal inferences that can be drawn
from task results (Cook & Campbell, 1979). A highly controlled and standardized
testing situation may yield results of high internal validity, but has little in
common with the everyday situations that a patient is faced with. Again,
individualized tasks are aiming to provide relevant situations that might not
always be fully controlled by the clinician. For example, a patient could be sent to
the hospital’s cafeteria to purchase specific items. During this task, the patient
might encounter different people, distractions and obstacles each time the task is
administered. Hence, internal validity of such task results may vary widely across
individuals and trials.
Campbell and Fiske (1959) discussed convergent and discriminant validity
as an additional test validation method. In more recent publications, both validity
concepts have been summarized as evidence based on relation to other variables
(APA, et al., 1999). Task results are correlated with other well-validated tests that
rely on similar or different underlying concepts. High correlations are expected for
similar tests, whereas tests with different conceptualization are expected to show
lower or no correlations. Using unique tasks for each individual patient does not
provide a basis to compare to already-established tests, so that convergent and
discriminant validity may not be suitable to validate the concept of a contextsensitive task.
5

Nadolne and Stringer (2001) evaluate the importance of ecological validity
for clinical assessments. The authors argue that traditional paper-and-pencil
measures do not relate strongly to real world tasks. In their sample of 31 stroke
patients, ecological simulations of orientation behavior showed higher correlations
with real world wayfinding than traditional tests of visualization and orientation.
The concept of ecological validity, which expresses how closely test and real world
situations are alike, is arguably a key factor for using individualized rehabilitation
tasks. Such tasks’ unique and relevant content is aiming to be very close to the
patient’s everyday problems.
Development of cognitive tests and trainings commonly demands a
comprehensive evaluation of validity, including evidence across several different
domains of validity (APA, et al., 1999). Only ecological validity, the major
advantage of individualized tasks, is not essential for the overall validity of an
evaluation study (Shadish, Cook, & Campbell, 2001). In summary, individualized
tasks do not seem to be suitable for evaluating all aspects of validity such as
external and internal validity. Ylvisaker (2003) also addresses the controversy of
scientifically evaluating the flexible treatments of context-sensitive rehabilitation.
He admits that a rigorously controlled clinical trial is difficult to achieve due to the
uniqueness of each patient’s intervention. However, Ylvisaker notes:

[…] if context is considered the independent variable, with one group
receiving cognitive retraining delivered by rehabilitation specialists in a
clinical setting using training tasks that are not individualised and the
other group receiving services delivered by everyday people (e.g., family
members, teachers, job coaches) in everyday settings with training and
support from specialists — and with tolerance for considerable
variation in the specifics of that intervention — then the study is
conceptually simple. (pp. 11/12)
The question arises whether this broad evaluation between context-sensitive
treatments and traditional alternatives is suitable to identify specific factors that
make either approach successful. As previously discussed, the wide range of
uncontrolled factors in context-sensitive treatments results in very low internal
validity, so that conclusions about its efficacy cannot be attributed to any particular
aspect of the treatment other than its individualism for each patient. Moreover, if
context-sensitive and process-specific aspects are to be combined in a cognitive task,
construct validity and evidence based on internal structure (APA, et al., 1999) play
an important role for task development and evaluation. Process-specificity requires
that the developed tasks actually measure the underlying cognitive processes that
they purport to measure. Consequently, task development should emphasize
standardization for strict validity evaluation while still being flexible enough to
meet the needs of each brain-injured individual. This controversy emerges as one of
the main challenges of this dissertation.

1.4 Clinical Usage
Whenever new treatments are developed it is important to consider the context in
which they are going to be applied. Thus, a rehabilitation task has to satisfy a range
of requirements that are inherent to a clinical setting. Time is a sparse resource
during rehabilitation. On average, stroke patients spend 15 days in the USA
(Conroy, DeJong, & Horn, 2009) and three to four weeks in Germany (betanet,
2011) in inpatient rehabilitation. Individualized trainings need to effectively use
this time without requiring too many supervised therapy sessions. Due to the
complex nature of brain injuries, patients with stroke or traumatic brain injury
often require a combination of physio-, occupational and cognitive therapies
(Mercier, Therese, Hebert, Rochette, & Dubois, 2001). Hence, a cognitive task
should be flexible enough to fit any patient’s therapy schedule. As a patient recovers
throughout the rehabilitation process, therapy goals and demands change. Any
treatment should be able to accommodate these changes and adapt in frequency
and difficulty. The short duration of inpatient rehabilitation and limited time of
therapists also give rise to the use of unsupervised training that can be continued
after therapy sessions have finished or the patient is discharged from inpatient
services. In addition, tasks need to be as intuitive to use as possible so that
therapists and patients do not require lengthy instructions and supervision.
Moreover, motor and cognitive deficits of neurological patients need to be taken into
account for usability and accessibility evaluation.
Context-sensitive rehabilitation promotes the use of meaningful,
individualized tasks in inpatient and outpatient settings (Ylvisaker, 2003).
However, frequent visits of rehabilitation experts to the patient’s home or
workplace are costly and time-consuming. Additionally, institutionalization after
neurological deficits is a common situation in which patients are confronted with an
unfamiliar environment (New Zealand Guidelines Group, 2006). These patients are
often faced with more severe cognitive deficits (Patel, Coshall, Rudd, & Wolfe, 2002)
that prevent them from leaving the hospital and visiting relevant environments
during inpatient rehabilitation. Thus, it is important to integrate information of
relevant environments into the patients' therapy schedule while they are still at the
hospital. However, this process appears unrealistic in many clinical settings to date,
as the additional effort to gather the necessary information has to be seen in the
context of decreasing health-care budgets. Both, the cost-effectiveness of the
treatment and the inclusion of individual information, have to be taken into account
when designing a context-sensitive rehabilitation task.
Further, rehabilitation hospitals are often well-structured environments in
which patients participate in carefully-designed therapy programs. Therapy
frequencies, scope and variety of activities at rehabilitation hospitals are often
based on strict standards of health-care providers and rehabilitation guidelines (e.g.
International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health). Therapists and
nurses are available around the clock to assist patients with their problems. Such
structured settings may not always provide the means to practice relevant everyday
tasks under realistic, unstructured and unpredictable conditions. As a consequence,

7

hospital-based individualized tasks need to replicate, or at least approximate, the
complexity of everyday situations that patients are faced with outside of the
rehabilitation hospital.
Lastly, rehabilitation needs to address the individual’s reintegration into the
community and social context. Involving family, community service agencies, and
schools has been recommended by Ylvisaker (2003), Sohlberg and Mateer (2001),
Sloan and colleagues (2004), and Wade (2000, 2001). These parties are directly
involved in the care and social reintegration of the brain-injured individual long
after inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation have finished. Their support is of
critical importance for the development of individualized cognitive tasks, as they
can provide much information about the problems and situations that need to be
trained during rehabilitation.
In conclusion, context-sensitive rehabilitation has been advocated by several
clinical researchers in the past (Adams, 2003; Ylvisaker, 2003). Its implementation
in the traditional context of process-specific rehabilitation (Sohlberg & Mateer,
2001) especially in terms of treatment validation and cost-effectiveness must be
subject to further investigation. In particular, this dissertation addresses the
development of flexible clinical treatments and how they meet the demands of
context-sensitive and process-specific rehabilitation.

1.5 Virtual Reality (VR)
Thomas Furness III. (1992) defines VR as “the representation of a computer model
or database in the form of a system of virtual images which creates an interactive
3D environment which can be experienced and/or manipulated by the user.” (p. 12).
This thesis proposes a framework of context-sensitive applications which
make use of VR technology. Cognitive tasks are embedded in virtual environments
(VEs) which can be manipulated by a brain-injured patient. Hence, an introduction
to VR is given in the following chapter. While not all of the mentioned applications
strictly involve VR technology with a high degree of interactivity and immersion, all
of them offer viable approaches to treating cognitive deficits and provide valuable
information for the clinical application proposed in this dissertation.
Cognitive training applications such as Rehacom1, CogniPlus2 and CogPack3
provide a wide range of tasks for process-specific rehabilitation. They promote highfrequency training for specific cognitive domains. These cognitive domains are
based on scientific models, such as van Zomeren and Brouwer’s (1994) model of
human attention. A large selection of individual tasks is aimed at training specific
cognitive sub-systems as described in the underlying model (e.g. divided attention,
sustained attention). The therapist chooses which tasks are the most appropriate
for the patient’s individual situation and deficits. This approach allows for
individualized treatment for each patient through selection of relevant tasks. While
some tasks have been designed to resemble common situations and chores that
people are confronted with in their daily life (e.g. driving a car), others are
variations of puzzles and mini games (e.g. card games) that do not have to be
relevant to the patient’s context. Furthermore, only few clinical trials have shown
their effectiveness beyond traditional therapy concepts. Most literature overviews
on the publishers’ websites list studies in psychiatric rehabilitation of which most
have been conducted more than a decade ago (Olbrich, 1996). However, technology
has changed substantially since then and several of the listed programs have long
been revised or support of previous versions has been discontinued.
RehaCom also presents a list of clinical trials in which their training has
been used. Exemplarily, Weiand (2006) examines the efficacy of a process-specific
training based on RehaCom tasks and compares it to an unspecific training of
similar complexity using Microsoft Word. 51 patients were included in this study
and randomly given either an unspecific training using Microsoft Word or a specific
attention training using the RehaCom software. A first supervised training
consisted of three weeks and a total of 15 hours of training. A second training

protocol allowed the participants to continue their previous training method on
their own for additional three weeks. Neuropsychological assessment and an
assessment of activities of daily living were conducted before and after the training
protocols. The effect of both trainings was examined regarding to specificity,
transfer, generalizability and motivation to continue training voluntarily.
A total of four cognitive tasks of the RehaCom software were used during the
specific training protocol. The tasks “AUFM” (attention and concentration) asks the
participant to match series of pictures to a reference picture. The reaction time task
“REAK” was used to train reaction to visual and acoustic stimuli in an individual or
forced choice paradigm. The “VRO1” tasks trains spatial abilities by displaying twodimensional stimuli which have to be matched to a reference image. The displayed
images contain features which require aspects of mental rotation. Lastly, the
“GEAU” task places demands on the user’s divided attention by displaying several
sets of visual cues to which the user has to react as quickly as possible.
Despite the lack of adjustment for multiple statistical comparisons (i.e.
Bonferroni adjustments), the author does not find any significant differences
between both training approaches, as both groups show large improvements across
most attentional outcome measures. Further, no tangible transfer of the training to
the patients’ participation in daily-life was found. Any improvements on the used
self-report measures of activity and participation in life can more plausibly be
explained by conventional physio- and occupational therapy that the patients
received. However, the process-specific RehaCom tasks appear to be successful at
keeping patients motivated for continuous training even after the supervised
sessions at the clinic have finished. As such, the process-specific training seems to
be a good choice for long-term self-guided exercises. It just remains to be tested
whether a more individualized training approach can actually be superior to the
tasks that Weiand (2006) used. The lack of meaningful evidence for the training's
transfer to daily situations further underlines the need to evaluate context-relevant
training tasks.
It has to be noted that not all of the available programs provide normative
data for their respective subtasks (e.g. RehaCom), as they are primarily designed
for therapeutic use, not for cognitive assessment. On the contrary, computerized
neuropsychological assessments require a thorough evaluation of validity and
reliability. For example, Testbatterie zur Aufmerksamkeitsprüfung4 and Wiener
Testsystem5 assess distinct cognitive functions by using a battery of abstract tasks.
Both systems provide normative data for several age groups. Numerous clinical
trials have taken advantage of the process-specific nature of either test by assessing
subdomains of attention (Sturm, Willmes, Orgass, & Hartje, 1997; Tucha et al.,
2008) or cognitive performance for driving assessment (Golz, Huchler, Jörg, & Küst,
2004). Again, only few of the provided tasks resemble everyday situations that are
meaningful for the unique background of patients with brain injuries. Patients

mostly have to react to abstract stimuli that are presented on screen. For example,
TAP’s divided attention task displays an array of crosses on the screen and the user
has to push a button whenever four crosses form a square. As a second task low and
high tones are presented to which the user has to respond whenever two of the
same tones are presented consecutively. While this task is based on existing
theories of divided attention (Zomeren & Brouwer, 1994), it does not closely
resemble any meaningful tasks that a patient could be confronted with in a home
environment. However, as these computer tasks are only used for cognitive
assessment, in some instances fidelity and ecological validity can be of less
importance than for a comprehensive training program. In fact, several
computerized attention assessments purposely choose abstract tasks or place
specific demands on the attentional system. For example, TAP’s vigilance test
simulates a very monotonous task by repeatedly alternating a visual stimulus
between two locations on screen. In very few occasions the user has to press a
button whenever the stimulus remains on the same location for two consecutive
trials. As long as the validity and reliability of such tasks has been based on results
of methodically sound research studies, such abstract tasks can provide a basis for
the clinician’s decision-making process throughout cognitive rehabilitation. Taken
together, computerized assessment and training tasks are valuable tools as long as
they are well-grounded in theories of cognition and possess excellent psychometric
properties. However, due to their low fidelity and ecological validity they may not
be an optimal choice to assess and train patients during cognitive rehabilitation
when the patient's unique context is a major concern.
Looking at context-sensitive rehabilitation, very few computer-based tasks
have utilized individualized content. NeuroVR (Riva et al., 2011) has been among
the first to actively pursue individualized training and therapy content. When
NeuroVR 1.0 was first tested to evaluate its feasibility for individualized cognitive
rehabilitation in 2008, the application was very limited in its fidelity,
customizability and user interface. Since then, Version 2.0 has been released in
early 2011 with a wider range of integrated environments and support for
importing external 2D and 3D models. Generally, the program is designed to enable
therapists to create meaningful VEs for clinical applications. For example, the
authors of the software have used NeuroVR to treat obesity and anxiety disorders
(Gorini & Riva, 2008). The scenarios usually consist of existing scenes and imported
media (e.g. sounds, pictures, 3D models). However, NeuroVR is not an out-of-thebox therapy tool; it rather provides a toolset to create meaningful experiences for
patients. Several generic VEs are included in the software and can be used and
modified as needed for a therapy session. Despite its recent upgrade to Version 2.0
the program’s visual quality is still low compared to modern game engines. For
example, the rendering engine does not support advanced features such as real-time
shadows, ambient occlusion or postprocessing effects when compared different
applications described in later chapters. Also, the setup of a meaningful
environment requires substantial work. Basic interactivity is provided within the
scene editor. While this set of ‘triggers’ can replicate straight-forward tasks of
picking up items, playing sounds and animations, more sophisticated cognitive
tasks will require access to more functionality or the editor’s source code.
Essentially, NeuroVR can be seen as a simulation engine with limited access to
features such as rendering, file import/export, user interface and scripting. The
11

scripting of interactivity has been implemented as an icon-based interface.
However, without knowledge of scene editors and their functionality substantial
time-investment can be required to build a relevant virtual scenario.
Taken together, NeuroVR is a tool to create, edit and present VEs for
therapeutic use. Compared to more complex game engines, it provides a more
accessible entry for using VEs in therapy. However, each editor program needs to
make a tradeoff between ease of use and complex functionality. NeuroVR in its
current version (Version 2) appears to be primarily developed for clinicians who
seek to use basic VEs for their treatment. Thus, the flexibility and complexity of the
produced scenarios is limited and may not always be well-suited for complex
neuropsychological assessments and trainings. This aspect is critical for the
implementation of a set of well-defined cognitive tasks in VEs. Without the
flexibility to precisely control displayed content, user interface and data recording,
an iterative patient-centered development process does not seem feasible with
NeuroVR. Such flexibility and the intended clinical use are the main aspects that
set NeuroVR and the application developed during this dissertation apart. NeuroVR
is presented as a development tool for clinicians. On the contrary, the proposed
application of this dissertation contains cognitive tasks which are embedded in
individualized VEs. Task development and implementation of relevant task context
are done by a software developer using a modern game engine to increase the
application’s flexibility and fidelity. The resulting tasks are developed iteratively
based on feedback of patients and clinicians. The finished individualized tasks are
then used by a clinician who is not required to invest additional time into
development or integration of individualized context. Most importantly, each VE is
identical to the relevant real-world scenario instead of being a generic scene
enhanced through familiar sounds and objects.
Several other computer-based programs for treatment of anxiety disorders,
phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been developed in the past.
All of these applications are to some degree flexible and adjustable to the patient's
needs. While therapy scenarios generally are static, the therapist can control the
patient's exposure to critical stimuli. For example, VEs for exposure therapy have
been successfully used for combat-related PTSD (Rizzo et al., 2010), PTSD caused
by terrorist attacks (Freedman et al., 2010), spider phobia (Garcia-Palacios,
Hoffman, Carlin, Furness III, & Botella, 2002), Aviophobia (Price, Anderson, &
Rothbaum, 2008) and Agoraphobia (Vincelli et al., 2003). The therapist's influence
on stimulus exposure can vary considerably between applications. Virtual Iraq
(Rizzo, Graap, et al., 2009) and Virtual Afghanistan (Rizzo, et al., 2010) provide for
a high degree of customization to allow the therapist to re-create the patient's
traumatic experiences for controlled exposure. Complex visual stimuli, sounds and
odors can be produced on demand in response to the patient's vebal feedback or
physiological parameters such as heart rate and galvanic skin response. This
individualized, immersive therapy is able to achieve positive outcomes that go
beyond the results of traditional imagination therapy (Rizzo, Difede, et al., 2009).
Exemplarily, Rizzo and colleagues (2009) found significant and clinically
meaningful decreases in scores of the PTSD Checklist-Military Version and the
Beck Anxiety Inventory such that 16 of the 20 participants did not meet diagnostic
criteria for PTSD after the VR treatment protocol.
12

Customized VEs have also been used in psychological experiments,
especially in the domain of navigation research. Real-world places have been
modeled and turned into virtual research scenarios for participants to walk
through. Even though these environments are often not flexible and customizable
as such, they have been specifically built to resemble real environments. Koh and
colleagues (1999), Ruddle, Payne and Jones (1997) and Witmer, Bailey, Knerr and
Parsons (1996) successfully applied VEs for studying human navigation and were
able to demonstrate the utility of such environments for training purposes. The
authors' results suggest that the simulation of real-world scenarios is feasible so
that similar technology could also be used to create realistic, individualized VEs for
cognitive rehabilitation.
When considering VEs for context-sensitive rehabilitation, it is important to
first evaluate the limitations and potential of the underlying VR technology. For the
past decades VR technology has been used in many different domains such as
education (Virvou & Katsionis, 2008), simulation for expert training (Lewis,
Aggarwal, Rajaretnam, Grantcharov, & Darzi, 2011) and therapy. Looking at
medical uses in particular, Rizzo and Kim (2005) and Rizzo, Schultheis, Kerns and
Mateer (2004) discuss the advantages and disadvantages of VR systems in a
therapeutic context. Even though both reviews have been conducted six and seven
years ago respectively, most of what the authors discuss still appears to be of
relevance. In Rizzo and Kim’s overview the following aspects were among the key
characteristics for VR systems and therefore should be taken into account when
developing VEs for individualized rehabilitation.

1.5.1 Systematic and controlled delivery of complex stimuli
One of the biggest advantages of VR applications is the possibility to create large
and complex environments while still being under control of every aspect of the
system. Stimuli can be presented systematically and timed precisely. This feature is
of high importance for development and evaluation of rehabilitation assessments
where repeatability and standardization are critical factors. The resulting
applications can be of high internal validity and reliability without compromising
the complexity of the delivered stimuli. For example, Rizzo and colleagues (2010)
developed a complex scenario for treatment of combat-related post-traumatic stress
disorder. Several simulated scenarios are embedded in realistic Iraqi or
Afghanistan environments. Despite the environment’s complexity, the therapist is
under precise control of the exposure and severity of the presented stimuli so that
patients can be gradually confronted with stress-inducing situations.
The standardization of tasks within individualized environments also
provides the opportunity to compare patient performance with normative data.
Further, task performance can be compared across patients and training sessions to
quantify training progress. By keeping most task parameters constant and
manipulating specific stimuli, the therapist can selectively test scenarios depending
on the patient’s individual needs. This methodology essentially allows for
hypothesis-driven evaluations for individual brain-injured patients or even
comprehensive clinical trials.

13

1.5.2 Enhanced ecological validity
As previously outlined, ecological validity can be seen as a key component for
assessing cognitive skills that are relevant for functional tasks in a real-world
context (Nadolne & Stringer, 2001). For the purpose of this discussion enhanced
ecological validity relates to a comparison to traditional paper and pencil
assessments or their computerized counterparts. Task transparency and relevant
functional tasks such as wayfinding through a VE or remembering groceries for
preparing a breakfast in a virtual kitchen, are examples where ecological validity
can be described as enhanced when compared with abstract traditional assessments
of cognitive functions.
A constant rise in processing power enables modern computers to render
VEs very realistically. Accurate physics simulations, realistic lighting and humanlike avatars provide experiences that are close to the real world. Immersive displays
and intuitive interaction methods further enhance the user's experience so that
ecologically valid scenarios can be created that closely resemble relevant,
naturalistic settings. With growing popularity of video games (Entertainment
Software Association, 2007) more tools and resources are becoming available to
develop VEs with even higher levels of realism. Modern game engines already
provide the technology to develop environments that can be easily recognized by
users and allow for high visual quality. Trenholme and Smith (2008) give an
overview of several game engines and their functionality for the development of
first-person VEs. Since then, several other game engines such as UDK6, Torque3D7
and Unity8 have become available to produce interactive 3D environments of even
higher quality.
Already more than a decade ago VEs provided fairly realistic simulations in
which users could learn spatial layouts and apply their knowledge to real-world
places (Ruddle, et al., 1997). More recently, realistic applications have been
developed for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. The technology behind
Virtual Iraq (Rizzo, Graap, et al., 2009) and Virtual Afghanistan (Rizzo, et al., 2010)
is based on the video game “Full Spectrum Warrior” by Pandemic Studios. The VEs'
ecological validity is enhanced through the use of head-mounted display, haptic
feedback, realistic sounds and exposure to odors. The different modalities are
expected to trigger memories and consequently a stress reaction in the user in order
to successfully apply methods of cognitive behavioral therapy.
For the purpose of this thesis it is assumed that the visual quality and
realism of the VEs are of central importance in order for patients to recognize and
acknowledge the relevance of the task and context at hand. Essential
characteristics of virtual scenarios and tasks (i.e. transparency, believability,

plausibility, and relevance) are summarized under the term “realism” in order to
describe that the patient can recognize the employed tasks and scenarios and refer
to them based on past experiences. Using real photographs for texturing and
remodeling furniture and accessories strongly enhance the realism of the
environment. The relevant virtual scenario captures the patient’s interest and
improves long-term motivation to use the virtual tasks at high frequencies.
Transparency and “realism” in a broader sense can relate to plausibility and
place illusions which are described by Slater (2009). Plausibility illusion refers to
the fact that the user believes the virtual scenario is actually occurring. It is caused
by events and the scenario relating directly to the user (e.g. virtual character
talking to user). Place illusion refers to the sensation that the user is actually
situated in the displayed location and is described in relation to sensorimotor
contingencies of the VR system (e.g. user interaction, tracking and multimodal user
feedback). Slater’s definitions do not exactly fit the scenarios of this thesis as there
are no virtual events directly targeted at the user and simple desktop systems are
being used. However, task transparency and relevant virtual scenarios are believed
to contribute to the described illusions that virtual events and locations are actually
relevant for the user and engaging for cognitive rehabilitation. For example, a
cognitive task that is embedded in a user-relevant scenario directly relates to the
therapy goal of the patient and represents a desired outcome of the patient’s
rehabilitation (e.g. virtual kitchen with cooking tasks relates to the scenario that
the patient aims to engage in independently at home). This stands in contrast to the
abstract nature of traditional neuropsychological tests which may have little in
common with real-world scenarios (e.g. using abstract objects for mental rotation).
Scenarios of high realism are believed to be of advantage when patients deny their
cognitive deficits. The realism of a task can potentially lead patients to compare
their performance with common standards and past experiences and make them
realize that their cognitive abilities may not match their subjective perception. This
is the basis for patients actively engaging in cognitive training and making progress
throughout their cognitive rehabilitation.

1.5.3 Immediate performance feedback
VEs are capable of delivering automated feedback depending on the user's
responses. Feedback can be provided about the quality of the patient's performance
whenever tasks and problems are solved. More importantly, dynamic feedback can
guide the user during a task to promote error-free learning. For example, sounds or
visual cues can be triggered based on the user's movement, distance towards
targets, or any arbitrarily defined parameter within a VE.

1.5.4 Ability to pause and resume assessments
Closely related to feedback delivery is the ability to pause and resume assessments
and trainings at any time. In real-life scenarios or traditional neuropsychological
tests it is often not possible to leave the current testing situation or to interrupt a
testing session at any time. VR applications can often be paused and resumed as
needed in order to explain strategies and give verbal feedback to the patient.
Immediate breaks during training sessions might also be necessary during exposure
15

therapy. The virtual scenario can be stopped quickly when the patient's stress-level
increases.

1.5.5 Extensive capabilities for recording and analyzing user behavior
Sophisticated collection of user data is a major advantage of VEs. Modern VEs are
often based on realistic physics-models and built to scale. Every object and avatar is
placed in a three-dimensional coordinate system which allows for precise
measurements of all user movements within the VE. These measurements can then
be used to compare against or predict real-world performance. Further, the user's
interactions with the application via a user interface can be recorded and analyzed.
Eye gaze, body tracking, electroencephalography (EEG, i.e. brain-computer
interface) and psychophysiological measures such as heart-rate and galvanic skin
response can provide information about the user's cognitive and emotional
processes. Collected data can often be processed in real-time and used for direct
feedback or graphical analysis. In sum, there is a multitude of data collection tools
and methods available that can be employed within VEs or through means of
external hardware. Such data collection abilities are not exclusive to VR
applications, but can be seen as an advantage when used in conjunction with a VE.
Specifically, stimulus exposure can be controlled precisely in virtual scenarios so
that the occurrence of a critical stimulus can be recorded and related to the user’s
reaction (e.g. EEG, psychophysiological measures). This procedure can provide
additional insights into neural, physiological and behavioral aspects of human
performance when compared to traditional paper and pencil assessments during
which stimulus exposure cannot be timed and recorded as precisely.

1.5.6 Backend data extraction and management
The large amount of data that can be extracted from a VR application can exceed
the complexity of results of traditional neuropsychological assessments. For
example, extensive log files of timed events within a VE are contrasted with simple
reaction times or correctly/incorrectly answered items on traditional paper and
pencil assessments. It then becomes a question of how this complex data can be
processed, stored and condensed to aid clinicians in their decision-making process.
Clinicians often do not possess advanced knowledge in software engineering to
understand the underlying design, development and capabilities of the used
application. Hence, interactions with VR applications should be as intuitive as
possible without requiring much technical knowledge or programming. It is also
advisable to integrate capabilities of data analysis and visualization into the
developed VR application in order to avoid the need for additional software that the
clinical user needs to handle. Such analysis should provide comparisons to
normative data and a variety of scores that are usable in a clinical context (Rizzo &
Kim, 2005). Taken together, a balance needs to be found between the complex data
that can be output by modern VR applications and a user-friendly overview of
results that takes into account the clinician's needs. Large data sets can be useful to
extract information which has not been available in traditional assessments.
However, a clinician often may need to make a decision about whether a patient can
live independently (or return to work, return to duty) and hence should only be
exposed to as little data as is needed to make a well-informed decision.
16

1.5.7 Delivery of safe and risk-free training environments
VEs can be used to simulate a wide range of scenarios. Training environments can
either be inaccessible for real-world training or simply too dangerous to practice in.
For example, VEs can be used to safely expose at-risk-populations to critical tasks
like street-crossing behavior (Katz et al., 2005). Surgeons or medical students can
practice complicated procedures before applying their skills on real patients
(Parsons et al., 2008). Patients during cognitive rehabilitation often have no access
to relevant training environments while they are at a rehabilitation hospital. After
suffering from stroke or traumatic brain injury, patients may spend several weeks
in acute and rehabilitation clinics without returning to their home or workplace.
Home visits are often not allowed due to safety concerns. VEs can then provide safe
and meaningful training content to these patients.

1.5.8 Accessibility for users with motor and sensory disabilities
Many brain-injured patients suffer from motor or sensory impairments (Walker &
Treven, 2007) that prevent them from using traditional input devices such as mouse
and keyboard. During assessment and therapy these impairments can prevent
patients from receiving beneficial treatments or confound results of traditional
tests. VR applications have attempted to adapt to the impaired user base by
implementing novel interaction methods. Joysticks, modified gamepads, eyetracking or speech-interfaces have been used in various trials and rehabilitation
programs. More recently, brain-computer-interfaces, gaming input devices and body
tracking have become increasingly popular and affordable to make rehabilitation
tasks accessible for patients with disabilities. The Nintendo WiiMote has been
particularly popular with researchers and clinicians as it provides a cost-effective,
intuitive input device for patients of all ages (Lange et al., 2010). An even more
intuitive solution provides the recently published Microsoft Kinect9 for full-body
tracking (Lange, Rizzo, Chang, Suma, & Bolas, 2011). With its tracking capabilities
it even enables patients with severe motor disabilities to move through VEs who
otherwise could not participate in most rehabilitative treatments.

1.5.9 Motivating nature with gaming content
Realistic VEs and elements of gameplay can increases motivation for continuous
training over extended periods of time (Prensky, 2002). Introducing characters,
adding achievements, scores and telling a story can be used to distract the patients
from the fact that they are being tested (Rizzo & Kim, 2005). The importance of
training motivation becomes apparent when looking at rehabilitation research.
High-frequent repetition of rehabilitative tasks has been suggested to promote
amelioration of cognitive and motor functions after brain damage. Moreover, task
repetition in different contexts appears to be critical to promote generalization of
practiced skills (Sohlberg & Mateer, 2001, p. 20). However, frequently repeating
monotonous tasks or going through abstract assessment batteries can adversely

17

impact a patient’s motivation. As the growing number of serious games suggests,
engaging game-like training content appears to be a method of choice to prevent
frustration and boredom of users.

1.5.10 Lack of tools and standards for development process
Development of therapeutic VR applications requires knowledge in software
engineering, VR hardware (e.g. Head-Mounted Display, CAVE displays, tracking
systems), usability and rehabilitation/clinical sciences. Each of these domains comes
with its own challenges. For example, there is an abundance of software
development suites available that can be used to create VR applications. Some of
them were not specifically designed to develop VR applications (i.e. game engines
such as Unity3D, Torque, Ogre3D, UDK) and others already provide support for VR
hardware (e.g. Quest3D, Virtools, NeuroVR). In addition to these “engines”, 3D
modeling programs and middleware applications (e.g. for physics or networking) are
sometimes necessary to implement features that are needed for individual projects.
Integrating all these engines and tools to develop rehabilitation software often
results in “one-off” projects that are too complex to adapt them to different user
groups or re-use them in several hospitals with larger groups of patients.
Consequently, a goal of clinical VR system development should be a transparent
application which can easily be adjusted to the hardware configuration of different
hospitals and the needs of different patient groups (Rizzo & Kim, 2005).
In addition, the process of user-centered design needs to take into account
both user groups of clinical VR applications: patients and therapists. Great care
needs to be taken when VR hardware and input devices are implemented for
neurological patients. There is a large heterogeneity within and between different
patient populations (e.g. frontal-lobe damage vs. right-hemispheric stroke)
regarding their motor, sensory, and cognitive deficits. Thus, a wide variety of input
devices and displays needs to be considered and tested to avoid ethical (e.g.
stereoscopic displays for epilepsy patients) and usability issues (e.g. tremor patient
using mouse input).

1.5.11 Adverse side effects
Side effects such as simulator sickness are still a problem for the wide-spread use of
VR applications. Even though with powerful hardware performance lag is becoming
less of an issue, some participants are still affected by symptoms of simulator
sickness when using unintuitive and complex interfaces (Stanney, Kingdon,
Graeber, & Kennedy, 2002). To minimize the risk for patients Stanney's (2002, pp.
721-730) guidelines for exposure to VEs are still the most accurate and up-to-date
protocols available for development of VR applications.

18

1.6 Summary
In summary, VR applications possess a large potential for systematically delivering
realistic training scenarios to patients undergoing neuropsychological
rehabilitation. Primarily, it is the complexity of the development process that
appears to be a limiting factor for using VR applications for individualized
rehabilitation. Ongoing costs for modeling unique 3D content and programming
individualized tasks need to be kept low for widespread use in clinical settings.
Moreover, if the applications' side effects can be minimized and the development
process adjusted to the short time-frame of inpatient rehabilitation, VR technology
could provide a powerful alternative for individualized cognitive rehabilitation.

19

1.7 Research Overview
It is the aim of this dissertation to develop, validate and apply a framework for
cognitive tasks that is based on the strengths of VR-technology and meets the
demands of a clinical rehabilitation context. Specifically, several standardized
cognitive tasks have been developed that are embedded in unique VEs. Three tasks
have been identified and developed within the scope of this dissertation. While the
complete rehabilitation system is expected to encompass several tasks from each
cognitive domain (memory, attention, executive functions), this dissertation is
aiming to evaluate the task domains of navigation, spatial orientation and spatial
memory. Tasks were chosen for their relevance in neurological rehabilitation –
specifically for patient with stroke for whom it is essential to be spatially oriented
in order to live independently.
Each VE is individually created to represent the user’s relevant context.
Therefore, it is expected that the environment is meaningful to the brain-injured
patient. This approach draws upon elements of process-specific and contextsensitive cognitive rehabilitation and provides a connection between both through
the means of VEs. Thereby, the rapid development process and the standardization
of the cognitive tasks constitute major improvements upon existing VE-based
rehabilitation programs. The modularity of the cognitive tasks reflects the
standards of current process-specific assessments (Sohlberg & Mateer, 2001). The
individual environment in which the tasks are embedded adds personal context to
the task. This procedure is based on practices of context-sensitive rehabilitation
suggested by Ylvisaker (2003).
For the purpose of evaluating the three cognitive tasks, four experiments are
described throughout this dissertation. Each experiment uses realistic VEs which
are based on real-world places. However, only Experiment four features an
individualized environment which was specifically created for the user. During the
early stage of this dissertation, Experiment one was conducted to test the Virtual
Navigation Task (VNT) in a real and VE. In order to implement this task in a
rehabilitation context it needs to be shown that navigation in virtual and real
environments is similar. Consequently, a virtual navigation task could be
meaningful for clinical decision-making about real-world behavior. Without any
previous user studies or clinical contacts this study was conducted with healthy
older participants. It was expected that their computer experience and overall
performance most closely resemble the characteristics of the target population with
neurological disorders such as stroke.
All subsequent experiments were conducted at the Neurological Department
of the Asklepios Rehabilitation Clinic in Schaufling, Germany. The pointing task
and spatial memory task (Virtual Memory Task – VMT) were implemented in a
virtual replica of the experimenter’s office. Both tasks were tested with a wide
range of neurological patients to determine whether task difficulty, user interface
and psychometric properties were adequate for clinical use. In addition, the VMT

20

was evaluated in a single case study in which a patient with severe traumatic brain
injury used the task as part of her inpatient rehabilitation.
Lastly, the following aims and hypotheses were derived with the goal to
demonstrate that the proposed system is appropriate for clinical use. Specifically,
the aims and hypotheses of this dissertation are twofold, targeting clinical and
technology aspects of system development.

21

2 SYSTEM AND PROCESS DESIGN
Development of clinical virtual reality (VR) systems requires the consideration of
technological and clinical system requirements. Both aspects have to be taken into
account when software and hardware choices for the application development are
made. Many software packages are available to create interactive virtual content.
Often, several programs have to be used in a more complex workflow to achieve best
results. The requirements and available options which have been considered for the
proposed VR application are presented in the following chapter.
The goal of the development effort is the creation of realistic virtual
environments (VEs) that closely resemble real-world places. For this purpose highquality, low-polygon 3D models are needed. Further, a set of cognitive tasks needs
to be developed that can easily be integrated into the created VEs. Game or
simulation engines can be used to create interactive applications which combine the
VEs, cognitive tasks, a user interface as well as data recording. Realistic
environments in the larger context of a simulation were chosen over the
development of a game, even though identical software and hardware is required
for either development effort. It was expected that the realistic nature of the
simulation enhances the transfer of cognitive abilities to the real-world, even
though this aspect was not evaluated during the course of this thesis.

24

2.1 3D modeling
Four applications have been evaluated for their use in rapid modeling of VEs.
Applications were chosen for the amount of information available online as well as
prior experiences of the developer. Table 1 presents the requirements for 3D
modeling and how they are met for each of these applications. Requirements were
selected based on estimated use for the development of VEs and were subjectively
chosen and evaluated by the developer. Information was gathered through
completing online tutorials, reading online forums and website descriptions of the
respective applications as well as using trial versions of each of the tools.

2.1.1 Ease of use
There is a wide variety of 3D modeling software available, each with its own set of
advantages and limitations. For the purpose of this dissertation, several software
packages have been evaluated. Most important criterion is the rapid development of
non-organic objects (i.e. architecture) with an easy entry to proficiently creating the
required objects. User discussion forums as well as written and video-based
tutorials (e.g. YouTube, www.lynda.com) are offered to learn the respective
programs. Autodesk's Maya and 3DS Max10 appear to fulfill both criteria while at
the same time having many online tutorials and learning material available.
Alternative programs of about similar quality and complexity (e.g. Modo, Lightwave
3D, Cinema 4D) do not offer a comparable user community and as much training
material. Blender11 as an open-source project is very attractive due to its free
10

25

availability and the large amount of training content. However, before Blender
version 2.5 was published in its various development stages between 2009 and
2011, the program's interface was complex and unintuitive (Reynish, 2008). Lastly,
Google SketchUp12 appears to provide a unique approach to 3D modeling with a
minimalistic interface. Architectural and interior modeling are considered to be
SketchUp's main areas of application.
In summary, all of the tested programs provide the desired functionality so that
even an inexperienced user can learn each of the applications with available
tutorials and user forums.

2.1.2 Export and Import of popular file formats
File format compatibility between development applications is a basic requirement
to form an effective workflow. 3D models need to be exported in formats that the
subsequent applications can process. Further, high popularity of the native file
formats of the 3D modeler are helpful for importing freely available models. The
COLLADA file format .dae and Autodesk's .fbx appear to be the most common file
formats supported by almost all 3D modeling programs. With the exception of
Google SketchUp, all other modelers support both formats. Google SketchUp only
provides extensive support for importing and exporting file formats, including the
export of .dae and .fbx files, when the Pro version of the software is purchased.

2.1.3 Availability of free 3D models
Using freely available 3D models such as furniture and plants can reduce the
development time and cost of environments. Many of the no-cost models on websites
like www.turbosquid.com are of the .obj or .3ds format and all 3d modeling
programs are able to import these free resources. In addition, Google SketchUp
provides a large repository of 3D models via the Google 3D warehouse which allows
cost-free objects to be directly imported into a 3D scene.

2.1.4 Support for texturing and UV-mapping
Realistic textures are a main contributor for the realism of a VE. All 3D modeling
applications provide support for importing textures and applying them to 3D
models via UV-mapping. Though, it is the complexity of this feature that
differentiates the available 3D modeling applications. Without any experience in
manually unwrapping meshes effectively and applying textures to them, SketchUp
provides an easy entry to texturing 3D models in a short amount of time. Though
control over the applied textures is fairly limited when compared to the complex
texturing tools that the other 3D modeling applications provide. The choice of
modeling application is a tradeoff between feature-sets and simplicity and should be
made based on the developer’s preferences and skillset.

2.1.5 Low-polygon modeling for real-time applications
When creating models for real-time 3D applications, optimization is important to
maintain high frame rates while the application is executed. Computer games and
simulations often apply a technique called low-polygon modeling to keep the system
requirements for the end user's computer as low as possible. In contrast, animated
movies, scientific and architectural simulations commonly use highly detailed
geometry or complex models exported from CAD-applications that are not suitable
for usage on average consumer hardware. Low-polygon models can achieve almost
the same visual quality as their high-detail counterparts when techniques like
bump-, normal- or parallax-mapping are applied. Consequently, a workflow for costeffective applications includes precise control about the 3D model's number of
polygons to avoid the need for expensive hardware to run the finished application.
All 3D modeling programs with the exception of Google SketchUp allow the user to
add, remove and edit polygons individually. Because of SketchUp's minimalistic
interface, no exact control over the number of used polygons is possible. However,
for the purpose of this dissertation and later use in hospitals all prototypical
applications were run on high-end computers where a higher polygon count is of
little consequence. During the course of 2010/2011 the target systems consisted of
hexa-core CPUs and PCI-E 2.0 graphic cards with GDDR5 memory and DirectX11
support within a price range of USD 2000 to 2500. Given the rapid advances in
computing hardware the relevance of polygon counts and optimization can change
in the future.
Taking the listed requirements and the developer’s preferences into account,
Google SketchUp Pro has been chosen as the 3D modeling application. The
program's minimalistic interface and the availability of free models via the Google
3D warehouse are the main aspects leading to this decision. However, for continued
development and distribution of VEs to end users like hospitals or patients, the
modeling workflow might require adjustment in the future to reduce the polygon
count of the created models. This can either be achieved by using a third-party
SketchUp plugin13 that adds the desired functionality or by switching to one of the
other available 3D modeling applications. All of the listed applications and others
such as Luxology Modo14 and Maxon Cinema4D15 are viable solutions and each
developer has a wide range of choices available depending on individual
preferences.

2.2 Task development and integration of VEs
Several game and simulation engines have undergone thorough testing regarding
the suitability for the proposed software development. Vizard Lite Edition16, Quest
3D VR Edition17 and Unity Pro18 have been used for projects related to the
assessment of cognitive functions. Small prototypes were developed which included
importing 3D models, implementing user input and data recording (Figure 1).
These prototypes were mostly unrelated to this thesis and will not be discussed in
detail. Based on subjective judgment, expected project tasks, and experiences
gained from the development of the initial prototypes, a list of requirements was
derived in order to select a game engine for this project. Information about each
application was collected through user forums, documentation, tutorials and
conversations with existing users. Additional programs such as UDK19 and
Torque3D20 have also been evaluated, but have not been used more extensively.
Their feature sets, target audience and business model did not seem appropriate for
the purpose of this thesis. An overview of each application and how each addresses
this thesis’ requirements can be found in Table 2.

2.2.1 Ease of use
Main requirement for choosing a development platform is the easy entry to
developing and publishing interactive VEs. An active user-community, thorough
documentation and the availability of online tutorials are of particular value for
this requirement. Vizard has the advantage of using Phyton, a well-documented
programming and scripting language for which there are many books and tutorials
available.
Quest3D features a visual scripting approach supports development without
any programming knowledge via node-based systems of logic blocks/channels.
Custom logic can be integrated via the LUA scripting language and custom
channels can be created via C++. However, the documentation of the latest release
(Quest3D 4.x) appears to be inferior to other development engines, especially
regarding the use of object-oriented development. On the contrary, the user
community and forum have always been helpful and quick to answer questions.
Unity's game engine has been through tremendous changes since early 2009.
After releasing a Windows-based version of the previously Mac-only engine in
March 2009, Unity has seen a steady rise in its userbase. In October 2009, the
former Indie-version of Unity was made available for free which resulted in another
large increase in users. The growing community led Unity Technologies to extend
their documentation, provide example projects and create a Question&Answer

29

website21. A large number of user-created tutorials and specialized courses provide
detailed instructions for most of Unity’s features.

2.2.2 Import of 3D models of popular file formats
All game and simulation engines have been chosen to support the initially selected
file formats of 3D models. Vizard imports .obj and .3ds models that each 3D modeler
is able to export. Quest3D has added support for the Collada format (.dae) during
their Version 4.0 release which can be imported and exported in all tested 3D
modeling applications. Unity is capable of importing most file formats supported by
current 3D modeling programs. Autodesk's .fbx, Collada's .dae, Blender's .blend,
modo's .lxo and many other file formats are supported. Further, Unity features an
automatic update of 3D models whenever they are saved within the 3D modeling
application. This results in a faster asset workflow between 3D modeler and Unity
than any of the other tested engines. Unfortunately, Google SketchUp does not
support saving files in .fbx formats directly so that each model has to be exported
first before any changes are automatically reflected in Unity.

2.2.3 Physics-engine
Physics engines are integrated into the framework of game engines as so-called
“middleware”. While there are different physics engines with varying sets of
features available, all of them are capable of basic collision detection to simulate
realistic walkthroughs in VEs. Raycasts, basic simulation of gravity, forces, joints
and rigidbodies are also commonly integrated in any physics engine. Advanced
features such as soft body physics and destructible environments are not essential
for the projects carried out for this thesis so that all game engines are generally
capable of fulfilling the listed requirements.

2.2.4 Realistic rendering and lighting
A game engine's rendering and lighting systems are important for the realistic
appearance of VEs. Without proper lighting and the effective use of a rendering
engine, environments look flat and artificial. In addition, lighting and rendering
environments are aspects of development that can have a large negative impact on
the application's performance depending on the adequate use of lighting and
rendering techniques. Vizard's rendering system is based on OpenGL including
support for basic lights and shaders via the OpenGL Shader Language (GSLS).
Quest3D provides a more extensive set of options including HSLS shaders,
lightmaps, shadow maps, normal maps, HDR lighting and many more.
Unfortunately, the documentation and implementation of these features are not
suitable for new users. In order to achieve high-quality results, extensive experience
with 3D graphics and shader programming are recommended. Lastly, Unity
features forward and deferred rendering for better performance with a large

21

30

number of real-time lights. Shaders, Umbra's occlusion culling22, Beast's
lightmapping23 and many post-processing effects are also included in Unity's
functionality. Most importantly, many features are user-friendly for non-expert
users as detailed documentation is provided and most effects simply need to be
dragged and dropped into the virtual scene. However, several features (e.g. realtime shadows, render-to-texture, occlusion culling, etc.) are only available for Unity
Pro users. Nonetheless, Unity's functionality and ease of use for producing
realistically rendered environments are well-suited for the workflow of the proposed
clinical application.

2.2.5 Integration of input devices and VR hardware
Communication with commercially available tracking systems, head-mounted
displays, projection systems and input devices is either already integrated in game
or simulation engines or needs to be added via the use of sockets or plugins. Vizard
and Quest3D already offer built-in support for many of these systems so that no
additional programming is required. Unity does not provide such support as it is
mainly targeting game developers who often publish their games to mobile devices
instead of visualization systems. However, Unity's large user community makes up
for the lack of supported external hardware by developing plugins and third-party
software which give access to such hardware and input devices.

2.2.6 Royalty-free publishing
While the publishing of finished applications is not the primary concern for
experimental studies and prototypical development, long-term use of the
individualized virtual rehabilitation concept has to be taken into account for
choosing a development platform. Funding of future extensions of the proposed
applications as well as commercialization through tech-transfer organizations have
to be taken into account. Hence, commercial publishing of the finished applications
as well as existing royalty schemes are relevant when choosing a development
architecture. Worldviz provides three product tiers that are distinguished by
different publishing options and feature sets. Vizard Lite Edition is neither viable
for experiments nor end-user distribution because it only allows to publish branded
non-fullscreen applications. Developer edition features royalty-free fullscreen
publishing for non-commercial purposes. Enterprise edition adds royalty-free
commercial distribution to the before-mentioned features. Quest3D features a
similar tier structure for its products. However, all three editions (Creative, Power,
VR) allow for royalty-free commercial publication of applications and are only
differentiated by inclusion of features. Lastly, Unity allows for royalty-free
commercial publishing with all of its products. Program versions are distinguished
by platform (e.g. PC/Mac, iOS, Android) and feature set (Normal versus Pro). Given
these publishing options for each development tool Unity and Quest3D provide
better options by allowing for unrestricted publishing of all applications.

2.3 Workflow
Based on the previously discussed software choices a workflow for the creation of
VEs has been established. The workflow was optimized based on available
resources and preferences of the developer. After testing different options of
capturing the real environment (e.g. hand-drawn sketches, photographs and
annotations on a smartphone and tablet) and replicating it as a 3D model the
following workflow was chosen for the creation of individualized VEs. All choices
were based on subjective judgment by the developer.
First prototypes of interactive 3D environments have been created with
Quest3D Academic VR Edition (Versions 4.0 – 4.3.2). The visual programming
concept and the licensing model were the main reasons for choosing Quest3D over
Vizard. By 2008 no Windows-based version of Unity3D was available yet. Before
any experiments were conducted in early 2009, the development platform was
changed to Unity Pro for Windows, Version 2.5 (up to Version 3.3) to take
advantage of Unity’s user community and documentation. All finished
environments are now enhanced by Unity-driven modular cognitive tasks. The
applied workflow is depicted in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Workflow for development of individualized environments

2.3.1 3D models
Prior to modeling any 3D scenario, the real environment has to be measured and
recorded. A 12-megapixel digital camera, a 6-meter tape-measure, a netbook, an HD
USB-webcam, a Wacom digital tablet, the software Microsoft Paint and a trolley
table to transport the equipment are used to gather all measurements. Photos of all
localities are taken with the webcam. Measurements are added to each photo using

32

the digital tablet and Microsoft Paint. This procedure appears to be the most
effective, even when floorplans were available. Floorplans are often outdated and
lack much information (e.g. heights, furniture, materials) so that photos have to be
taken regardless of the availability of any other information. Finally, the digital
camera is used to take high-resolution photos of materials and surfaces that are
later turned into textures. The complete setup can be seen in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Recording station for photos and measurements

In order to create evenly focused, non-distorted textures these photos have to be
taken at a 90-degree-angle towards the surface. For best results, flashlights and
light reflections on the surfaces are avoided24,25. All photographs are imported into
Genetica26 and turned into non-distorted, seamless tileable textures. Texture
resolutions are chosen depending on the texture's usage in the 3D environment.
High resolutions (1024x1024 pixels or higher) are chosen for highly visible objects
in the camera's foreground. Lower resolutions (e.g. 256x256 pixels) are more
suitable for less exposed objects in the background. When no high-quality
photographs are available, Genetica's texture generator or royalty-free textures
from www.cgtextures.com are used. All 3D geometry is created and textured with
SketchUp. Geometry is modeled for one-sided rendering so that unnecessary
surfaces (e.g. inside of an object) are not rendered. Therefore, the direction of
surface normals has to be taken into account when modeling. For easier handling of
larger models, objects are separated in different layers depending on their category
(e.g. windows, doors, furniture). Combinations of layers are then used to select,
manipulate, export or hide certain geometry. Whenever possible, freely available
models at Google's 3D warehouse27 are used for furniture items. However, the

theoretical advantage of having free models turned out to be of little use. Most
available models are of too much detail (i.e. too many polygons) and mostly useless
for real-time 3D applications. Reducing the free model's polygon count, cleaning up
layers and aligning all surface normals often takes longer than modeling a complete
object from start to finish. Completed 3D environments are exported as one-sided
geometry from SketchUp via the .fbx file format. Larger models have to be split up
into smaller parts to adhere to Unity's size limitation of 60.000 vertices per object.
Reassembling those parts in Unity is not necessary as long as they were all
exported within the same coordinate system, having the same pivot point. This is
achieved by choosing "export selected geometry only" in SketchUp and selecting the
appropriate parts of the model, preferably via the use of layers.

2.3.2 Scene setup in Unity
Once a model is imported into Unity, a second UV for lightmaps is created and
mesh colliders are added to the geometry. The scene lighting consists of a
combination of lightmaps and real-time lighting. If very few light sources are
present and the scene is fairly small, only real-time lighting is used. In order to
increase performance for large scenes with many lights, Unity's implementation of
Beast lightmapping is applied to static lights and geometry. Unity’s in-built shaders
are adjusted as needed, for example to display transparent materials like glass
(diffuse/transparent shader). The use of collision geometry largely depends on the
nature of the task. For tasks that allow unrestricted movement of the user it is
necessary to create a simple version of the environment to simulate collisions.
Detailed geometry like doorknobs and plants are replaced by simple cubes to avoid
low frame rates whenever the user collides with these objects. The collision
environments are imported separately into Unity and added as mesh colliders to
the original environment. Tasks with minimal or no user movement simply use the
original geometry as mesh collider. Lastly, asset packs that contain the cognitive
tasks are added to the finished environments. The cognitive tasks are described in
more detail in the following paragraphs.

34

2.4 Cognitive tasks
Three different cognitive tasks have been developed to be integrated into
individualized VEs. Each task is designed to be simply added to an existing VE in
the Unity editor. In order to be used in clinical sessions, the tasks have to be
configured for the individual patient. For example, relevant targets or locations in
the environment are selected and added to the task. The tasks’ aim is to assess and
train cognitive skills like spatial orientation and spatial memory. Despite the
individualized task context, the process-specific nature of each task and the
consistency of task-related features across each individual user are expected to
provide the means for collecting normative data.
At the current prototypical stage of development, task setup can only be
done by the developer as it requires in-depth knowledge of the virtual scene and the
Unity editor. The goal for future development is to be able to set targets for each
task by simply selecting them from a list and choosing from several task-specific
options outside of the Unity editor (i.e. within the standalone application). Once the
task has been configured, it is published as an executable file that can be run on
Windows PCs.

2.4.1 Virtual Navigation Task (VNT)
The VNT requires the user to traverse from a specified starting point to a target
position. Each target position can serve as the starting point for the next route, thus
combining several stages into a longer route. As such the task can be used to train
or assess the user’s knowledge of familiar environments. Also, the user can be
familiarized with important locations in unfamiliar environments. Both cases are
important for patients in cognitive rehabilitation who are unable to leave the
hospital. The procedure has been used in similar or slightly modified form in
several wayfinding experiments in the past ((Waller, 2000; Witmer, et al., 1996).
The task can be set up in the Unity editor by declaring any game object as a target.
The object needs to be tagged as ‘target’ and several target-relevant scripts need to
be added so that a task manager recognizes the item as a target. Once all targets
have been set up, the training or assessment can commence. Navigation through
the VE is implemented through any standard input device such as mouse, keyboard
or joystick. Input for movement and viewing direction can be mapped to any button,
mouse or joystick movement depending on the patient’s needs. Movement and
viewing direction are unrestricted so that the user can freely walk through the VE.
However, several mechanisms are implemented to restrict user interaction with the
environment when simulator sickness becomes an issue. Walking speed and view
rotation speed can be set to match the user’s comfort level. Further, extreme camera
rotations (i.e. looking straight up or down) can cause distortions to the rendered
environment. Thus, camera rotation can separately be limited or disabled on each
axis in the 3D coordinate system to avoid users looking up or down. Currently, the
application’s capability to provide instructions is limited to displaying the
navigation target (see Figure 4). The experimenter has to give any additional
instructions and provide feedback about the user’s performance.

35

Figure 4. Navigation task with onscreen instructions

During traversal the user’s position and rotation within the VE are recorded
at specified intervals (e.g. once every 100ms). All of these saved locations are
written to a text-file and saved to the hard drive of the local computer. Further, the
user’s walked distance and time to reach the target are written to the text file. Once
the session is finished, the text-file can be loaded in the Unity editor to display the
locations in the VE. This allows the experimenter to plot the course of the user and
measure distances and deviations between different routes.

2.4.2 Pointing Task
Pointing towards unseen targets requires the user to possess a mental
representation of the environment. This technique was first used by Curtis, Siegel
and Furlong (1981) and thereafter in several instances (Waller, 2000) to assess
configurational knowledge about environments. The task places the user at a
stationary location in the VE. From this position the user has to point towards
predefined target locations. As the task is aiming to test mental representations of
environments, the targets are occluded so that the user has no direct line of sight to
each location. A red marker is displayed in the center of the screen. The user’s task
is to rotate the viewing direction in order to match the red marker with the target’s
exact location. Viewpoint direction can be manipulated by mouse, keyboard or
joystick input. The application displays the name of the current target location
onscreen. The red marker is explained by the experimenter to be similar to the
user’s index finger for pointing towards a target (see Figure 5).

36

Figure 5. Pointing task within a virtual model of a rehabilitation clinic

Users are told to point through walls, floors, ceilings or any obstacles in
order to indicate the target’s location. The users are given the chance to familiarize
themselves with the environment before the task begins. Though, users are not
allowed to walk around the environment at any stage before or during the task.
Verbal feedback about user performance is given after all targets have been
finished. After each target the experimenter has the option of testing the user’s
distance perception. Distance and height difference towards the target can be
entered in text boxes. Height difference is defined as the vertical distance between
the target’s floor and the current position’s floor in the VE. The user’s answers
(direction vector towards the target, distance to target, height difference) are
written to a text file and saved to the hard drive of the local computer. The
application automatically calculates the differences between the user’s answers and
the angular and distance measures towards the actual target locations. Setting up
the task in the Unity editor is similar to the navigation task. Target objects are
manually defined by the experimenter. Target-relevant scripts are added to the
game objects. Once the task is set up, the application is published as an executable
to be run on any Windows-based PC.

2.4.3 Virtual Memory Task (VMT)
The VMT combines elements of traditional working memory tasks (Kessels,
Zandvoort, Postma, Kappelle, & Haan, 2000) and perspective taking tests (King,
Burgess, Hartley, Vargha-Khadem, & O'Keefe, 2002). Its rationale has been
inspired by experiments of King and colleagues (2002) and Shrager and colleagues
(2006) in which VR tasks were used to assess spatial memory of brain-injured
individuals. The task creates realistic scenarios for training and assessment of
memory functions where information acquisition and retrieval are not necessarily
identical (i.e. spatially rotated). The application can either be used to assess users
in familiar and unfamiliar environments or to practice memory-related strategies
by having the user find or place targets in specific locations in the environment.
Task difficulty can be manipulated through the number of memorized target items
37

and the angular displacement of the user's viewpoint. Both of the task's difficulty
parameters, item number and angular displacement respectively, can be changed
independently. The user is set at a stationary point in the VE and presented several
target objects. The scene camera can be rotated freely but no movement is possible.
The user has to memorize the exact locations of all the targets as accurately as
possible. After a set amount of time the targets are moved to different locations in
the environment. In addition, the scene camera can also be moved to a different
position in order to initiate a viewpoint change. The locations of the target objects
and scene camera can either be determined by the experimenter or randomly
changed according to set parameters (e.g. randomly placed in a circular area in the
environment). The randomized locations provide a variety of options for the
application’s use as a long-term cognitive training. The predetermined locations are
useful for assessments when several sessions have to be compared over time or
between users. As soon as all targets have been moved the user has to drag the
target objects back to their original positions. Items can be selected and moved
through mouse or keyboard input. The order in which targets are moved is not
relevant. When the user indicates that all objects have been moved to the correct
positions, the experimenter has the option to give visual feedback by overlaying
transparent markers of the original positions in the environment (see Figure 6).

Figure 6. VMT with visual feedback of correct item locations

The application saves the positions of all objects at the different task stages to
a text file. Distances are calculated between the original positions and the user's
answers. All locations can be loaded back into the Unity editor to allow for postsession analysis. The Unity editor is also used to set up the task prior to a training
session. Each game object in a VE can be used as a target by adding target-specific
scripts to the object. Targets and their location before and after viewpoint changes
are saved via a customized editor interface. A series of different tasks can be saved
for each patient's training session and published as an executable file via the Unity
game engine.

2.5 Costs
Based on the software choices and previously described workflow, the estimated
costs for initial and ongoing development are listed in Table 3 below. It can be
argued that Unity Free is a sufficient alternative if visual features such as realtime shadows and post-processing effects are of no importance. The actual costs for
developing the proposed cognitive tasks are not included in the table. For the
purpose of this cost evaluation the one-off cost of the task development is of no
relevance. The proposed workflow and framework are intended for continuous use
in a clinical context in which ongoing costs (i.e. development of individualized
environments) are the main concern. Comparing the total hardware/software costs
to sophisticated VR systems (e.g. Worldviz28), it becomes obvious that the proposed
development workflow and delivery method (i.e. flatscreen desktop system) provide
a cost-effective alternative to traditional VR setups. The workflow is based on the
preferences of each developer so that prices for software and hardware can vary
considerably. For example, Autodesk 3DS Max and Maya (instead of Google
SketchUp) cost USD 3,999.00 and USD 4,090.00 respectively29.

2.6 Summary
Taken together, the above mentioned components of the proposed application form
the basis of a clinical tool which combines context-sensitive and process-specific
features. Firstly, the efficient workflow is expected to provide the means for an
expert developer to create individualized VEs for each patient. It is hypothesized
that the patient is able to recognize the VE and train in task context that is similar
to relevant real-world scenarios. Despite the effort to build new 3D models for each
VE, this context-sensitive setup has to be efficient enough for integration into a
busy routine at a rehabilitation clinic. Secondly, the cognitive tasks need to provide
content for neuropsychological training and assessment which is specific to distinct
cognitive functions and validated through validity analyses. Through the
modularization of the cognitive tasks, the proposed application forms a symbiosis of
context-sensitive and process-specific aspects of cognitive rehabilitation. The tasks
are expected to be re-used across patients while the context is rapidly created for
each brain-injured individual. Detailed analyses of the application's validity and
clinical usage are discussed in the next chapters.

40

3 SYSTEM EVALUATION
The following chapter describes the evaluation and validity analyses of the software
that has been developed as part of this thesis. The chapters will be presented in the
order that their respective trials have been conducted. Visual quality and
functionality of the developed virtual environments (VE) gradually advanced over
the course of the four experimental trials. The Virtual Memory Task integrated in a
complex VE (Experiment 1) was the first functional prototype of this thesis to be
systematically tested with participants. Given the prototypical nature of the
assessment and the small number of available brain-injured patients in
Christchurch, New Zealand, healthy adults were recruited for this study. All other
experimental trials were conducted with brain-injured individuals at the Asklepios
Rehabilitation Clinic in Schaufling, Germany. The clinical trials were conducted
during a six month overseas visit in Germany between October 2010 and April
2011.
Usability and accessibility testing have been part of the development cycle of
each of the study's prototypical applications. However, most user feedback has been
collected verbally through unstructured interviews or open discussion with the
participants. The feedback often was integrated into the applications straight away
or before the next test session was conducted. Hence, the majority of feedback and
changes has not been documented. Whatever documentation of user feedback exists
will be integrated into the respective chapters.
Prior to the development of the Unity-based applications that have been
used in this dissertation's experiments, several simple prototypes have been created
using the Quest3D simulation engine. Even though these early programs were
valuable for developing a workflow for VEs, none of them have actually been used
in any data-collection and hence will not be mentioned in any detail here. However,
these applications lay the foundation for the data recording which has been used
throughout this dissertation's experimental trials. The procedure consists of
repeatedly writing the user's position and rotation within the VE to a text-file on
the local computer (e.g. once every 100ms). These position and rotation vectors can
then be used to plot the user's movement in the actual environment by reading
them from the text-file and feeding them back into the application. At each saved
location a simple primitive is placed in order to visualize the user's path through
the environment (see Figure 7 and Figure 8).

41

Figure 7. Early Quest3D-prototype of navigation analysis

Figure 8. Analysis of traveled path in the Unity editor (path annotated in red)

A similar approach is used for saving other task-related parameters such as
traveled distance or time-to-finish-task. The resulting text-files are arranged so
that they can easily be imported into Microsoft Excel or SPSS for further analyses.

3.1 Experiment 1 - Evaluation of the Virtual Navigation Task
This experimental study has been carried out in early 2010 at the University of
Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand. Results of this evaluation have been
published in the proceedings of the International Conference on Disability, Virtual
Reality and Associated Technologies 2010 in Vina del Mar, Chile (Koenig, Crucian,
Dalrymple-Alford, & Dünser, 2010). Further, the results have been published in the
International Journal on Disability and Human Development (Koenig, Crucian,
Dalrymple-Alford, & Dünser, 2011). The aim of this study is to validate the
previously described VNT. Target locations can be created within any VE and
navigation performance between these locations is recorded for post-hoc analysis
within the game engine Unity. This approach is the basis for assessing large-scale
spatial abilities in patients with brain injuries as part of their context-sensitive
rehabilitation. Specifically, this experiment aims to assess whether large-scale
navigation in a real and identical VE are equivalent. This approach is different to
previous experiments in which transfer between virtual and real environments
were the primary focus (Waller, 2000; Witmer, et al., 1996). Transfer in such
experiments refers to the improvement of performance in the real environment
when the user was exposed to a virtual model of the environment. This
improvement can simply mean that users find their way through the real
environment regardless of how this outcome is achieved. However, no equivalence
can be inferred as it was not analyzed how performance in both environments
compares in regards to the participants’ behavior. Hence, analyses of transfer of
knowledge and comparison of equivalence of performance in two related
environments (virtual and real) are conceptually different. Equivalence evaluation
requires the analysis of how participants navigate in both environments and
whether similar strategies or errors occur. This experiment attempts to explore
such behavior to go beyond existing research findings of transfer of wayfinding
knowledge (Standen, Brown, & Cromby, 2001; Witmer, et al., 1996).

3.1.1 Introduction
Navigation is a highly complex skill of moving oneself, a craft or vehicle through
novel and familiar environments. For many brain-injured patients with cognitive
deficits the ability to return back home or to work are primary goals. Therefore,
real-world navigation through complex familiar and semi-familiar environments
(e.g. neighborhood, route to work) is a key element of independent living. A variety
of cognitive functions such as memory, visual and spatial perception and problem
solving are involved in navigating through such environments. If any of the
involved cognitive functions is affected by a brain injury, the amelioration of
navigation deficits is an important part of cognitive rehabilitation. However,
navigation training during rehabilitation is often restricted to very few locations
like the hospital or the patient's home. When faced with such limitations it is
desirable to use simulations to retrain patients' lost abilities in a wide range of
environments. VEs with high ecological validity can provide the means for
individualized, context-sensitive training of navigation abilities. However, before
such technology can be applied, it is necessary to evaluate how real-world
43

navigation and virtual-world navigation compare, especially when complex
environments are of interest.
Until now, knowledge transfer between real and VEs and differences
between several modes of knowledge acquisition have been studied. The results of
these studies have been mixed. In a study by Richardson, Montello and Hegarty
(1997) healthy participants learned the layout of a complex building either from a
map, the real building or a VE similar to the real building. Test performance in the
real building yielded significantly poorer performance by the VE group. After
multiple training sessions within a large virtual building Ruddle, Payne and Jones
(1997) were able to demonstrate near-perfect route finding abilities of their
participants. Koh, von Wiegand, Garnett, Durlach and Shinn-Cunningham (1999)
compared real-world training with the participants' exposure to immersive, nonimmersive visualizations and also an architectural 3D model of the same
environment. During training participants were free to explore the environment.
While the authors concluded that training in virtual and real space are comparable,
no actual navigation behavior was required during the testing phase and only
estimations of bearings and distances were reported. Taken together, many
navigation studies have been limited in several ways. They only involve learning a
single predefined route or judgments of bearings and distances from stationary
viewpoints. This type of learning is valuable when demonstrating training effects
from simple VEs to the real world, but is not sufficient to specify how people
navigate through their surroundings. It is also inappropriate for making predictions
of real-world navigation behavior which is desirable in a clinical context. Looking at
predefined routes or knowledge of landmarks poses obvious restrictions compared to
finding your way through a complex environment. Moreover, when people navigate
in their daily life, their goals and priorities change often and unforeseen
circumstances and obstacles arise, so that a single predefined route is not always a
viable solution. Routes cannot always be rehearsed in advance and the navigator
has to make inferences about alternative routes and the overall spatial layout of the
environment. Assessing such configurational knowledge about the environment in
addition to route knowledge is a step in the right direction. Witmer, Bailey, Knerr
and Parsons (1996) trained their participants in a complex office building and
assessed route and configurational knowledge. However, their study is still limited
to a predefined route and landmarks along that route. The authors' results suggest
that using VEs for route learning is superior to maps, but inferior to real-world
training. Examining navigation behavior in all its complexity, this present study
explicitly compared human navigation in a large real-world building and its virtual
counterpart. The measurement of navigation behavior is part of this thesis’
proposed framework for assessment and training of cognitive skills in a clinical
context, with focus on patients with brain injuries. With such focus it becomes
important to assess how and why people are getting lost. Thus, an important aspect
for this study's design is the high demand which is placed on the participants'
navigation skills to provoke situations of temporary disorientation. The developed
virtual reality (VR) simulation is intended for use in the day-to-day routine in
rehabilitation settings. As such, usability, flexibility and compatibility with the
needs of brain-injured individuals are of highest importance. It is the aim of this
application to assess large-scale navigation ability and to make predictions about
navigation performance in the equivalent real-world environment. Such predictions
44

require that a VR-based simulation evokes similar behavior as compared to a realworld scenario.
This experiment is intended to test the hypothesis that critical navigation
parameters are equivalent in a VE and its real-world counterpart. Specifically,
walked distance, number of received cues, number of decision errors at
intersections, distance estimations and number of pointing errors are expected to be
equivalent in both environments. Navigation time, number of stops a participant
makes and total time spent standing still during navigation are predicted to be
higher in the VE, as these variables are expected to be influenced by the interface of
the computer application.

3.1.2 Methods
3.1.2.1 Participants
36 healthy, right-handed participants from the Christchurch community aged 40 or
older and unfamiliar with the tested building volunteered for this study. Only 29
participants are included in the analyses as three participants withdrew from the
study due to symptoms of simulator sickness, two participants were familiar with
the tested environment and two participants were excluded due to missing data
after a technical failure of a recording device. The specific age group was chosen to
include users with a wide range of computer experience and to assess the age
bracket of patients with higher chances of stroke who are expected to be a primary
target group in the future. Potential availability of patients with brain injuries was
discussed with clinicians from collaborating hospitals and brain injury community
groups in Christchurch. The issues of patient dropout, informed consent, comorbid
conditions (e.g. physical disabilities, depression, aphasia) and safety risks (walking
around a busy campus, simulator sickness) for patients was considered during these
discussions. Also, feasibility of recruiting brain-injured patients and bringing them
to the university campus for a three-hour test session was judged to be problematic.
Consequently, healthy adults were chosen instead of an acute or chronic clinical
sample.
Age of the participants ranged from 51 to 72 years in the real-building group
while the age for the VE group ranged from 42 to 66 years. Male and female
participants were equally assigned to both groups – six male and nine female
participants in the real-building group and five male and nine female participants
in the VE group.

3.1.2.2 Design
Participants were assigned to either a real-world or VE group in a randomized
blocked design. Each participant was shown the same set of 12 target locations
within the real version of a complex building on campus of the University of
Canterbury, New Zealand. Following the initial learning phase, a series of pen and
paper tasks for assessment of spatial abilities were completed. Finally, half of the
participants returned to the real building (real-building group) to find the
previously shown locations while the other half (VE group) was asked to complete
45

the same tasks in the virtual version of the campus building. No follow-up
assessment was included in the study protocol.

3.1.2.3 Materials
3.1.2.3.1 Real and Virtual Environment
The assessed environment was the seven-floor Erskine Building at the University of
Canterbury, New Zealand (Figure 9).

Figure 9. Erskine building, University of Canterbury

The building’s lower four floors were chosen for their complexity and
unusual layout. Several staircases throughout the building allowed for a large
amount of possibilities to traverse from one landmark to the next. An example of
one floor plan can be seen in Figure 10. The virtual model of the building was
created using Google SketchUp 7 Pro (see Figure 11). Textures were imported from
photographs and floor plans were used to model the building to scale. Floor plans
and measurements were displayed with Autodesk Design Review 2011. Interactions
within the VE, data collection, interface and visual and navigation analysis tools
were developed with the game engine Unity (version 2.6).

46

Figure 10. Floor plan of the Erskine building’s ground floor

Figure 11. Model of the Erskine building in Google SketchUp

The VE was displayed using a three-screen back projection system with a
field of view of 120° (see Figure 12). However, due to technical limitations the
47

displayed VE appeared slightly stretched at the left and right edge of the screen.
Each screen measured 2.44m x 1.83m. The participant was seated 2.2m in front of
the center screen. This set up allowed the participants to show natural orientation
behavior by turning to the side screens for searching the environment. The VE was
rendered using a quad-core PC with three Nvidia GeForce GTX260 graphics cards
running in SLI and a Matrox TripleHead2Go graphics expansion module.
Participants were provided a standard three-button computer mouse to navigate
through the environment. Cost-effectiveness of the used projection setup was only a
minor concern for this initial prototype. The VisionSpace Theater was chosen over
LCD screens and a head-mounted display for reasons of user comfort, field-of-view,
Unity integration and availability. Results from Bowman and colleagues (2002) as
well as Santos and colleagues (2009) suggest that the choice of display solution has
an influence on user performance. Clear relationships with computer experience,
input device and demographic characteristics of the studied population have not
been established yet. In future studies head-mounted displays and desktop setups
with LCD screens should also be taken into consideration.

3.1.2.3.2

Pen and paper tests

Spatial abilities were measured with the Object Perspective Taking Test (OPTT)
(Hegarty & Waller, 2004), Mental Rotations Test (MRT) (Vandenberg & Kuse,
1978) and the Card Rotations Test (CRT) (Ekstrom, French, Harman, & Dermen,
1976). In addition, orientation ability was assessed with the Santa Barbara Sense of
Direction Scale (SBSODS) (Hegarty, Richardson, Montello, Lovelace, & Subbiah,
2002). Simulator sickness was assessed using the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire
(Kennedy, Drexler, Berbaum, & Lilienthal, 1993). Computer experience was
measured with an adapted version of the Computer/Internet Experience and Skills
Questionnaire for: Internet Diabetes Trial at Harborview (Goldberg, 2006).
The OPTT requires the participant to judge bearings from imagined
viewpoints which are not aligned with the participant’s viewpoint. Each judgment
is compared against an angle which is defined by a constellation of three objects out
of an array of seven objects drawn on a sheet of paper. The average judgment error
is calculated for the absolute angular deviations across the test’s twelve items.
48

The MRT and CRT require the correct identification of test objects in
comparison to target objects. Test and target objects are three-dimensional line
drawings for the MRT and random two-dimensional polygons for the CRT. The
number of attempted test objects divided by the number of correctly identified test
objects is used as test score. The SSQ is a self-report measure for severity of
simulator sickness symptoms.

3.1.2.3.3

Navigation Test

Navigation through the Erskine Building consisted of two phases. During an initial
learning phase, all participants were guided through the building on a predefined
path which passed 12 target locations on four different floors. The total length of
the learning route was 498 meters. The lower four floors contained a total of 26
decision points where participants had to choose between alternate paths.
Alternate paths were classified as optimal, suboptimal or wrong. The
optimal path was defined as the shortest single route which takes the participant
from start to target. A wrong path is a decision which leads towards a wrong floor
(i.e. target is up but participant goes down), along a route which does not lead to the
target at all (i.e. dead end or wrong room) or any decision which is a direct
turnaround on a path which leads optimally or sub-optimally to the target. All
chaotic movement which cannot be classified as walking a defined path was
considered a wrong decision. All remaining path choices were evaluated for the
travel distance they require to reach the target, assuming that all following choices
minimize travel distance. The shortest of these paths is suboptimal, all others are
wrong. Optimal decisions were analyzed separately whereas suboptimal and wrong
decisions were combined to an error score. Suboptimal decisions were scored as an
error with a factor of one and wrong decisions were scored with a factor of two. The
error score is the sum of all non-optimal decisions.
Half of the twelve target locations were secluded and allowed no direct line
of sight to the other locations whereas the other half was in a more central location
with higher visibility towards other locations and the layout of the building.
However, in such a complex environment it was impossible to control the order and
amount of exposure that each location received during the initial learning route.
The hidden locations naturally received less exposure whereas the central locations
were seen more often during route traversal. Before walking along the learning
route the participant was instructed to pay attention to the target locations and
more importantly, to get a good sense of the overall layout of the building.
Instructions also included the fact that the traversed learning route and order of
target exposure were irrelevant for the following navigation test. Further, it was
mentioned that all target locations were again to be rehearsed before starting the
navigation test. Participants had to stay within the line of sight of the experimenter
at all times. Walking speed along the route was held constant. Orientation behavior
was strictly encouraged and initial instructions emphasized that the participant
was free to do what he/she normally does when being in a novel environment. For
example, participants were allowed to stop, turn around and orient themselves as
long as they kept close to the experimenter.

49

During the assessment phase of the experiment participants were expected
to demonstrate configurational knowledge from the very beginning by starting from
a different building entrance and finding new ways through the building. Half of
the target locations were designated navigation targets while the other half was
used for pointing tasks. Instructions, order and nature of tasks were the same for
all participants and both groups. Navigation and pointing tasks were always
alternated in a sequence which did not match the learning route.
For navigation tasks participants were instructed to find the shortest way to
the given target without using elevators or asking people for help. There were no
route restrictions and all of the first four floors were available for use. Cues were
given systematically whenever participants asked for help or indicated that they
were lost. Further, whenever a participant took more than two consequent wrong
turns at a decision point or when no progress was made on a wrong floor (>4
decision points without leaving the floor towards the correct floor), a cue was given.
Cues were categorized to either state that the participant is on the wrong floor, to
verbally identify the correct floor, to give a semantic cue about the target, to guide
towards the correct side of the building, and to explain in detail how to get to the
target. Cues were given gradually in the listed order except when a participant
asked specifically for a cue. Participants' navigation performance in the real
building was recorded on video. All videos were later analyzed using VirtualDub30
to extract the timing of all tasks, cues, stops and to plot the exact route on a floor
plan using Autodesk Design Review 2011 (Autodesk Inc.). In addition, the plotted
paths on the floor plans were rewalked in the VE with accurate timing to visualize
and analyze the data. That is, by transferring all data into the VE, distances,
number of stops, angles and viewpoints were easily computed and displayed in 3D
space with pinpoint accuracy. For visual and computational analysis of the
participants' routes, the original VE was modified using the Unity game engine to
allow the experimenter to visualize all data, rewalk routes and carry out distance
and angular calculations after the experiment was finished.
As soon as a navigation target was reached a tripod with an attached
protractor was set up at a predefined pointing location. The tripod had a wooden
plate mounted on top with an attached clock-hand. The protractor was hidden
underneath the wooden plate to prevent giving any cues to the participant. The
clock-hand was used by the participant to indicate the direction in which the
pointing target was expected to be (see Figure 13).

Figure 13. Pointing device

The absolute deviation from the correct angle was recorded. Pointing targets
were always on the same floor and not visible from the participant's position.
Participants were not allowed to leave the location where the tripod was set up.
After pointing towards the pointing target, the participant was asked to estimate
the egocentric euclidian distance towards the same target. The participant's answer
was scored as a percentage of the actual target distance. Lastly, an empty floor plan
(only the outer walls of the current floor of the building) was provided in which the
participant had to draw his current and also the position of the pointing target. The
location of two building entrances was shown on the floor plan to give the
participant a better sense of distance and location. To analyze the participant's
answers the floor plan was divided into a three by three array of sections. The
deviation from the correct section was counted so that diagonal movement was not
allowed. The highest possible error score for any response is therefore four, given
that the participant's mark is in the opposite corner of the building from where the
correct target location is.

3.1.2.4

Procedure

Participants were tested individually with each session lasting two to three hours.
The experiment started at the Psychology Building at the University of Canterbury,
New Zealand. After an initial briefing participants gave written informed consent.
During the first 15 minutes questionnaires for demographic background, computer
experience and the SBSODS were completed. Next, the participant was taken to the
Erskine Building. The experimenter led the participant along the predefined
learning route through the building and explained all twelve targets. After leaving
the training environment, the participants returned to the Psychology Building
where they completed the MRT, OPTT and CRT. Before navigation performance
was tested, a list of the twelve targets was presented. Feedback and further
explanations were given about all targets until the participant felt confident and no
questions remained.
For the navigation assessment half of the participants were guided towards
a different side entrance of the Erskine building. The other half of the participants
was tested at the VisionSpace Theater of the HIT Lab New Zealand. A simple
environment with two visible targets was used as a practice scenario for navigation
51

and pointing tasks. After each participant was comfortable with using the mouse,
the VNT started at the exact same virtual side entrance which was also used for the
real-world assessment. The remainder of the testing session was identical for both
groups as described previously.

3.1.2.5

Statistical Analysis

The basis of the present study is a comparison of real and virtual navigation with a
prediction of equivalence being made between both groups. This by itself poses a
problem, because traditional null hypothesis significance testing intends to test for
differences between experimental groups/conditions. Further, the absence of a
significant difference is not to be interpreted as both groups being equivalent
(Nickerson, 2000). The research field of pharmacology, specifically
pharmacokinetics, has made use of the two one-sided test as a method for
equivalence testing (Schuirmann, 1987). Tryon (2001) and Tryon and Lewis (2008)
suggest and alternative method through the use of a range (delta) which is defined
by the extreme points of adjusted inferential confidence intervals (ICIs) of both
groups. If delta is smaller than a predefined range of indifference, statistical
equivalence is established. However, the range of indifference needs to be
determined on substantive grounds which is not a trivial task for any research
question. In conclusion, a hybrid approach to statistical analysis has been chosen.
Firstly, both groups were compared with t-tests for independent means seeking to
find a significant difference. Effect sizes for all comparisons were also calculated
following the procedures of Cohen (1987). Lastly, the ICIs for both groups were
calculated and their overlap was determined. The overlap measure indicates the
percentage of participants which are included in the overlapping area of both
groups' ICIs. A high overlap of the ICIs indicates that the results of both groups are
similar, providing further evidence towards the equivalence of the experimental
conditions.

3.1.3 Results
Levene's tests for homogeneity of variances were conducted for all comparisons of
navigation performance and pen and paper tests. The variances for Total Time of
Stops differed significantly between the VE and real building group (F(1,27)=14.89,
p=0.0006). No other Levene's tests showed a significant difference. Lilliefors' tests
for normality indicate that none of the distributions reported in this study differed
significantly from a normal distribution.
As expected, most critical navigation parameters did not show a significant
difference at p = 0.05 (see Table 4). Performance in the pen and paper tests was not
significantly different between the real-world and VE group. There was no effect
evident for the CRT (d=0.19). MRT, and OPTT showed small-medium effect sizes of
d=0.48 and d=0.41 respectively.
For navigation distance no significant difference was observed. Participants
in the VE group on average travelled 46 meters further than participants in the
real environment. Cohen's d was found to be small for this comparison (d=0.37).
Confirming our expectations, there was a significant difference between navigation
52

time of both groups. Participants spent significantly more time navigating through
the virtual Erskine Building which resulted in a large effect size (d=1.76). Variance
for the VE group was large and individual performance ranged from 501s to 2111s.
Navigation time was based on the total time for all six navigation tasks. Pointing
tasks were not included in this measure.
The number of cues that were given to the participants did not differ
significantly between both groups. However, a medium effect size (d=0.6) indicates
that there was a difference in the number of help cues the VE group and the realbuilding group received even though this difference did not reach significance. This
might also be due to the large variance in the VE group where two participants
received 20 and 21 cues respectively. When both participants were excluded from
the analysis, the effect size was reduced to d=0.24. A t-test for independent means
showed no significant differences between both groups when the outliers were
removed (t(25)=-0.622, p=0.539).

The comparison of navigation decisions is of central importance, as this
measure directly quantifies how participants navigated through the real and VE.
As predicted, no significant differences were found for the number of optimal
decisions and the decision error score. A small effect was found for the number of
optimal decisions (d=0.17) and a small effect was evident for the decision error score
(d=0.28). Systematic errors when drawing navigation and pointing targets onto
empty floor plans showed no significant difference. The effect size for this
comparison was found to be small (d=0.22). No significant difference was found for
distance estimations in both groups. Nonetheless, participants who were assessed
in the VE appeared to consistently underestimate the true distances towards
53

pointing targets (d=0.66). A large effect size for angular pointing errors (d=0.73)
indicates that pointing errors were larger in the VE than in the real building. The
difference between both groups was non-significant. The remaining comparisons for
number of stops and total time spent standing still both showed large effect sizes
(d=1.61, d=1.67) and significant differences between both groups. Participants
navigating through the VE stopped significantly more often and spent more time
without virtual movement.
In addition to the aforementioned analyses, inferential confidence intervals
(ICIs) were calculated for both groups of all measures (Tryon, 2001; Tryon & Lewis,
2008). A large overlap of ICIs, that is a high number of data points in the
overlapping range of both ICIs, is an indication for the equivalence of both groups.
However, as a result of this analysis almost no overlap was evident (see Table 4).
Floor plan errors showed the highest overlap with eleven of the 29 participants in
the overlapping range of the two groups' ICIs (38%). All remaining participants
were located to the extreme left and right of the distribution of error scores.
Correlations of pen and paper tests (MRT, CRT, OPTT) with our navigation
parameters were non-significant throughout. Only CRT score and errors in the floor
plan task correlated significantly (r=-0.516, p=0.007) such that higher CRT scores
were associated with less errors in this task. Also, age and gender showed no
significant relationship towards any of the navigation measures.
Computer experience of the participants in the VE group was correlated with
all navigation outcome measures. Correlations were generally negative and nonsignificant. Computer experience and the number of optimal decisions along the
traversed route were positively correlated (r=0.564, p<0.05) which suggests that
participants with higher computer experience performed better in the VE.
The participants’ experience with the VE was almost entirely positive.
Participants were asked to report symptoms of simulator sickness at the start and
end of the test session as well as during a debriefing period after the session. Few
participants reported mild symptoms of simulator sickness and three participants
had to withdraw from the study due to more severe symptoms. The average
increase of the total score from pre-assessment to post-assessment was 32.21
(SD=40.37) over 18 participants.

3.1.4 Discussion
In this experimental trial, validity of behavioral measures in a complex building
was assessed and navigation performance in the VE and its real-world counterpart
were directly compared. The VNT focused on configurational knowledge of the
building and the 29 participants were required to make inferences about the
shortest routes which had not been part of their previously shown learning route.
Most navigation parameters did not show a significant difference between
the real-building and VE group. When participants were required to make decisions
along their travelled routes, their decision errors and choices for the optimal,
shortest route did not differ significantly between groups. In addition to the
standard statistical analyses, effect sizes were calculated in order to further support
54

the hypotheses of equivalence of both groups. Small effect sizes for both variables
supported the initial null hypothesis tests. Another variable of importance is the
number of cues which the participants received to find the navigation targets.
Again, both groups did not differ significantly and a medium effect size was
observed. Only after removing data of two participants who received most of the
cues in the VE group, the effect was reduced to small size. Both participants had
difficulties adjusting to the VE and using the navigational interface. Due to their
difficulties to navigate adequately, abrupt viewpoint changes resulted in symptoms
of simulator sickness so that breaks between navigation tasks were needed.
Consequently, the removal of data points from this analysis seemed justified.
To further substantiate our hypotheses of equivalence, an additional
analysis was conducted which uses the amount of overlap of inferential confidence
intervals (ICIs). Overlap between scores of both groups was very low for all
variables. The analysis revealed that a substantial amount of data points were
located at the extreme positive and negative ends of the parameters' distributions.
The finding of such small overlap of our groups in light of no significant differences
and small effect sizes suggests that further research is needed to explain navigation
behavior in complex natural environments. Equivalence of navigation in real and
VEs would result in high overlap of ICIs. On the contrary, substantial differences
between both navigation scenarios would lead to findings of large effect sizes and
significant differences between navigation parameters. Our results provide no clear
evidence for either scenario, so that an extended evaluation of this paradigm is
required to shed light on the relationship of virtual and real navigation behavior.
The conducted analyses suggest that a large variability of navigation behavior is
evident in complex real-world and virtual scenarios. User interaction and visual
properties of the VE (Bowman, Koller, & Hodges, 1998; Stanney, et al., 2002;
Stanney, Mollaghasemi, Reeves, Breaux, & Graeber, 2003) play an important role
in any comparison of virtual and real navigation. Future studies need to explore
which of these factors contribute to such variability in either scenario.
A variety of other measures were used to quantify the participants' ability to
find their way through the building and estimate the position of targets around
them. None of these measures produced a significant difference, but effect sizes
varied considerably between tasks. Distances in the VE were consistently
underestimated which is in line with previous findings in the literature (Furness &
Henry, 1993; Witmer & Kline, 1998). However, contrary to other experiments, our
targets were not visible from the participant's viewpoint and had to be judged based
on configurational knowledge of the building rather than visual cues. Similar to the
study by Furness and Henry (1993), display distortion could play a role in the
participants’ underestimations of distance. In their study a group of 24 architects
were asked to complete navigation, orientation and distance judgment tasks in a
real and virtual gallery under several different display conditions. The authors
report that underestimations were greatest when a head-tracked head-mounted
display was used which potentially led to the participants seeing a distorted image
at the periphery of the projected field-of-view. The projection screens in this current
experiment were also distorted towards the left and right horizontal edges which in
turn can potentially affect orientation behavior and distance judgment.

55

The number of stops and the total time participants stopped on their routes
were intended to assess the extent to which each person showed orientation
behavior. Participants in the real building used such stops to search for landmarks
and find their bearings. Unfortunately, many additional virtual stops were recorded
due to difficulties with the computer mouse and issues with collision detection
within the VE. With these limitations in mind, it comes as no surprise that a
significant difference for both variables of stopping behavior was observed and the
results of these analyses cannot contribute to the interpretation of navigation
ability as intended.
In order to consider the use of VEs in cognitive rehabilitation the difficulty of
three-dimensional environments has to be evaluated. Such quantification of
difficulty is necessary to provide alternate versions of navigation tasks, classify
routes and environments which patients are exposed to, and adjust training
difficulty in the context of complex rehabilitation trainings. In recent experiments,
researchers manipulated the number of turns or the length of the route, because
they are simple to measure and implement in an experimental setting (Koh, et al.,
1999; Ruddle, et al., 1997). However, most real-world environments cannot be
compared to simple office corridors in a university building. Everyday scenarios like
residential houses or shopping malls often have multiple floors and there is more
than one viable path which leads to the target. For simulation of these scenarios
different measures need to be found in order to assess complex behavior in a
standardized, systematic way. How visibility, number of possible routes, results of
pathfinding algorithms or other yet undefined variables influence the navigation
performance in complex environments must be subject to further investigation. In
addition, the relationship of VE performance and well-established clinical measures
of spatial abilities needs to be examined. The results of Nadolne and Stringer (2001)
and Kozhevnikov and Hegarty (2001) suggest that small-scale tasks like mental
rotation place different demands on the cognitive system than navigating through
the environment. Hence, more ecologically valid assessments are needed and the
continued evaluation of VEs for such purpose seems justified. Navigation through
relevant environments is an important aspect of independent living for braininjured patients. Assessing and training navigation in complex everyday scenarios
as part of context-sensitive rehabilitation is a notable improvement over the current
practice of time-consuming training at the hospital or the patient’s home. Virtual
navigation applications allow for more sophisticated, quantifiable scenarios that
can be employed remotely without risk for the patient and lower costs for the
therapist and health care provider.
In conclusion, the VNT has shown potential as a useful tool for accurately
capturing a complex skill like navigation ability. By leveraging the strengths of VEs
the capture, interpretation, and visualization of navigation data has been achieved.
However, our results show no correlations with other measures of spatial ability
and the complexity and high variability of our data did not allow for an
unambiguous interpretation. This suggests that measuring navigation ability in all
its facets is a highly complex matter which cannot easily be related to existing
measures of configurational knowledge of environments. To further increase the
validity of gathered navigation data, several improvements towards higher
usability of the VE are necessary. Issues of simulator sickness, display distortion
56

and model detail of the VE need to be addressed. Further, it is necessary to
replicate the experiment with brain-injured patients in order to understand
whether navigation behavior is equivalent in real and virtual environments for this
clinical population. Current results cannot be used to draw conclusions about the
navigation performance of brain-injured patients. Previous studies suggest that
brain-injured patients perform significantly worse on almost all tests of cognitive
function, depending on the severity and location of brain lesions (Rao, et al., 1999;
Schretlen & Shapiro, 2003). Unfortunately, only little evidence was found that
specifically addresses differences in navigation behavior in healthy and braininjured individuals. Only Livingstone and Skelton (2007) found that patients with
traumatic brain injuries were significantly worse than healthy controls in using
distant landmarks in the background to navigate through a virtual model of the
Morris Water Maze. This suggests that the patients’ frontal lobe and hippocampus
lesions may impair the ability to form mental maps of the environment.
Consequently, brain-injured patients might show significantly worse performance
on the pointing task applied in this thesis (i.e. pointing to distal unseen landmarks)
and also require more detailed proximal cues in the VE in order to find the target
locations. Though it is currently unknown how brain injuries affect patients’
performance in a complex environment such as the Erskine building.
However, the current investigation provides a first step and comparison data
for future studies with a clinical sample. With refined navigation measures and
large samples of brain-injured participants more insights into the underlying
factors of navigation performance variability are expected. Such insights are needed
to utilize more ecologically valid assessments, as with higher ecological validity
complexity of the assessment increases substantially. A valid cognitive task with
such high ecological validity could greatly contribute to context-sensitive
rehabilitation and give the clinician a basis for judging the patient’s abilities in
real-life settings.

3.2 Experiment 2 - Evaluation of Virtual Memory Task (VMT)
This study has been conducted at the Neurology Department of the Asklepios
Rehabilitation Clinic, Schaufling, Germany, between October 2010 and April 2011.
Results of this clinical trial have been published at the VR International Conference
2011, Laval, France (Koenig, Crucian, Dünser, Bartneck, & Dalrymple-Alford,
2011a) and the International Journal of Design and Innovation Research (Koenig,
Crucian, Dünser, Bartneck, & Dalrymple-Alford, 2011b). The main goal of this
experimental trial initially was the validation of the aforementioned VMT (see
Chapter 2.4.3) in order for it to be integrated into context-sensitive rehabilitation.
However, the inclusion of patients with a wide range of neurological disorders also
provided valuable feedback about using a VE-based cognitive task with such
population. At the same time, the heterogeneous group of participants did not allow
for firm conclusions about the validity of the employed methods.

3.2.1 Introduction
During inpatient rehabilitation therapists are often faced with the uncertainty of
how the patient is going to perform at home or the workplace after rehabilitation
ends. Assessments usually reflect patient performance at the clinic in a highly
structured environment. This performance may not translate to the home
environment or workplace. In their daily routine individuals are faced with
decisions, obstacles and unpredictable situations that often exceed complexity of
structured therapies and activities in a clinical environment. Unless an outpatient
program is planned, the clinical team typically does not receive any feedback about
how the patient fares during daily activities. In worst case scenarios, patients
return to the clinic after their situation worsened and they have failed to live
independently. Until now, an ecologically valid task which reflects the individual
circumstances of the patient seemed unrealistic in terms of required labor,
construct validity, and cost-efficiency. Such task would give the clinical team a
basis for deciding about the patient’s aftercare and day-to-day performance.
An additional challenge during cognitive rehabilitation is the patients’
motivation for engaging in highly repetitive training tasks. Task repetition in
different contexts is especially important to promote generalization of practiced
skills (Sohlberg & Mateer, 2001). However, repeating monotonous tasks several
times each day or going through abstract batteries of cognitive assessments can
adversely impact a patient’s motivation. Weak motivation is even more likely if the
training tasks are not relevant to the patient’s daily life (i.e. low ecological validity).
This is often the case with simplified cognitive tasks where attention or memory
functions are trained with shapes, patterns or primitives (e.g. several subtasks of
CogPack31 and RehaCom32). Modern commercial cognitive tasks, brain teasers, and
31

games are more entertaining and subjectively seem to show higher face validity, but
scientific evidence for functional improvement in user groups with brain injuries is
sparse (Westerberg et al., 2007). Further evidence is necessary to ensure that these
programs support generalization of trained abilities (Owen et al., 2010).
Consequently, a set of validated cognitive tasks which are relevant to the patient’s
needs and background are needed.
This present study proposes a cognitive task which can be integrated into
many VEs. The VMT was designed to provide a clinical tool which has several
advantages over traditional cognitive tasks:




higher ecological validity by using personalized, realistic VEs
higher motivation for patients to practice the task frequently in a
meaningful test environment
precise measurements in three-dimensional space for analyzing the task's
results

The proposed VMT has been tested with 45 individuals with a wide range of
neuropsychological deficits at the neurological department of a German
rehabilitation clinic. It was designed to involve a combination of short-term memory
and perspective taking skills. Hence, correlations with neuropsychological tests
measuring those constructs are expected. Specifically, the VMT’s outcome measure
is predicted to significantly correlate with pencil and paper measures of spatial
abilities and visual short-term memory. No significant correlation is predicted with
measures of attention. Further, it is expected that a larger number of target objects
and a larger perspective change are associated with larger VMT error scores. The
test’s integration into clinical context, usability, task development, and task
validation are discussed in the following chapter.

3.2.2 Methods
3.2.2.1 Participants
45 participants (22 male - 23 female) at the Neurological Department of the
Asklepios Clinic Schaufling, Germany, were recruited for this trial. Neurological
patients with severe traumatic brain injury (6 patients), subarachnoidal
hemorrhage (2), brain tumor (4), epilepsy (5, including 2 with hippocampal
sclerosis), stroke (9, mostly right-hemispheric), normal pressure hydrocephalus (1),
Chorea Huntington (1), Syringomyelia (1), Multiple Sclerosis (6), anaphylactic
shock (1), herpes encephalitis (1), meningitis (1), and hypoxic brain damage (1)
volunteered to participate in this study. Volunteers were specifically chosen to
represent a broad range of attentional and mnestic deficits, including non-deficient
and highly-impaired individuals. Five therapists and one orthopedic patient
without cognitive deficits were also recruited for this study. Average age of the
participants was 38.56 years (range 17 – 66 years). The only requirement for

59

recruitment was the ability to concentrate and maintain performance for at least 30
minutes. Computer experience was not required for participation. All patients were
able to give informed written consent. Availability of patients, range and severity of
brain injuries and inclusion and exclusion criteria were discussed with the clinical
staff at the hospital. Due to the limited timeframe of six months, the anticipated
availability of patients and the unpredictable nature of neurological rehabilitation
(dropout due to return to acute hospital, occurrence of seizures, headaches, refusal
for informed consent, lack of health plan coverage) patient numbers cannot reliably
be estimated. Hence, specific brain lesions (e.g. right temporo-parietal lesions for
deficient spatial abilities) were not taken into account as inclusion/exclusion criteria
in order to avoid receiving not enough feedback and only few data points for
statistical and usability evaluation.

3.2.2.2 Design
Order of tasks was identical for most patients but differed in few cases when
patients had already completed tests with other therapists or at previous hospitals.
Assessments were completed within a few days up to three weeks, depending on the
patient’s therapy schedule.

3.2.2.3 Materials
3.2.2.3.1 Pen and Paper Tests
All pen and paper tests were translated to German where appropriate. For
economic reasons translations were done by the experimenter and discussed with
the clinical team at the Asklepios Clinic, Schaufling, for their appropriateness and
use of suitable terminology.
Spatial abilities were assessed using the Object Perspective Taking Test
(Hegarty & Waller, 2004) and the Mental Rotations Test (Vandenberg & Kuse,
1978). Attention was assessed with the D2 Test of Attention (Brickenkamp, 1981).
Memory and working memory assessment consisted of the immediate forward and
backward block span and digit span of the Wechsler Memory Scale III (Wechsler,
1945/1997), and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (Osterrieth, 1944). An
adapted version of the Computer/Internet Experience and Skills Questionnaire for:
Internet Diabetes Trial at Harborview (Goldberg, 2006) was used to assess
computer experience and skills. German versions and translations were used for all
test instruments.
The OPTT and MRT have already been described in Experiment 1. Details
about both tests can be found in the previous chapter.
Block and digit span assess the visual and verbal short-term memory
(forward) and working memory (backward). The experimenter taps on a sequence of
blocks or reads a sequence of digits which the participant has to reproduce in the
same or reversed order (forward/backward). Difficulty is increased gradually across
trials. Correctly reproduced items provide the test score.

60

The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test consists of a complex drawing
which can be decomposed into 18 distinct objects. The participant’s first task is to
copy the reference figure without omitting any details. In a second trial, the
participant has to immediately draw the figure from memory once the reference
drawing has been removed from sight. A third trial has to be completed after 30
minutes in which the participant has to once more draw the figure from memory.
Immediate and delayed recall trials were scored and analyzed separately, because
due to time restraints not all participants were able to complete the delayed trial.
The D2 Test of Attention consists of 14 rows of stimuli on a DIN A4 sheet of
paper, each consisting of 47 letters (“d” or “p”). Additionally, each letter is
accompanied by a series of dashes above or below the letter. The participant’s task
is to identify each target “d” containing a total of two dashes, either above, below
the letter or both. The participant is given 20 seconds per row to identify as many of
the 21 or 22 targets as possible. Stimuli are processed consecutively within each
row. After each 20 second interval, the experimenter gives a cue to advance to the
beginning of the next row. Results are analyzed for processing speed, omission and
false positive errors. The total number of processed targets minus the number of
errors is used as the test’s score.

3.2.2.3.2 VMT
The VMT was placed in a realistic, to scale model of the rehabilitation clinic in
which the study was carried out. Most rooms of the clinic have been modeled for
carrying out several experiments. Only one virtual office room within the clinic was
chosen for the VMT assessment. Sufficient detail and photorealistic textures were
used in order to enable participants to easily recognize the environment. The 3D
model was created using Google SketchUp 8 Pro. Textures were imported from
photographs, prepared with Genetica 3.51 Basic Edition and used within Google
SketchUp. Measurements for accurate modeling were gathered manually from the
real environment. Interactivity of the environment, data collection and task logic
were implemented using the game engine Unity, Pro version 3.1. Task development
and testing procedures were carried out on a PC workstation with AMD hexacore
CPU, 2GB NVIDIA GTX460 graphics card, 8GB of memory and solid state drive. All
tasks were displayed on a 24-inch LCD monitor that was placed 60cm in front of the
participant. Keyboard and mouse were used to interact with all tasks. Development
of the VE followed the procedures as outlined in previous chapters (see Chapter 2.3).
The VMT was implemented in the virtual model of the office in which the
participant was seated during all tests. Real and virtual viewpoints were identical
so that the participant was facing the same 90cm x 100cm virtual table on which
keyboard, mouse and monitor were placed. The virtual table was empty apart from
several task-relevant items (Figure 14). The virtual office room was deliberately
chosen for this experiment, because it was easily accessible for 3D modeling.
Further, it was one of few rooms in the clinic to which patients did not have any
previous exposure before the test session was conducted. For the purpose of this
study the replication of the office room was not strictly necessary, as the validity
evaluation could have taken place in any VE. However, the virtual office did give
the participants an additional sense of space. Moreover, the use of a generic VE was
61

avoided, because the virtual model of the rehabilitation clinic (including the office
room) was also needed for experiment three (chapter 3.3).
Prior to the first task the participant was shown an overview of the
surrounding VE for 15 seconds to allow for better orientation within the virtual
office. Instructions were given to focus attention on the virtual table and the items
placed on the table. The participant was given two minutes to memorize the exact
locations of the target items. After two minutes or as soon as the participant
indicated that all locations had been memorized, the target objects were moved to
new locations on the table. Locations for all trials were initially randomized during
test development and identical for all participants. The participant’s task was to
precisely drag and drop the items back to the initially learned locations. Each trial
included a specific number of target items (4, 5, 6 or 7) and a defined change in
perspective. The initial perspective while learning the item locations was always
congruent with the participant’s viewpoint (Figure 15). When items were moved to
new locations, the perspective either remained unchanged, moved to the left of the
table (90 degree shift) or to the opposite side of the table (180 degree shift). The
viewpoint change was carried out as a passive, continuous motion towards a new
location in the VE with the user’s virtual field of view always centered on the
virtual table. The participant had no control over the viewpoint change at any given
time.

Figure 14. Participant completing the VMT

Participants were not informed about upcoming perspective changes and
were instructed to take into account possible perspective changes when learning the
spatial layout of items. Even though the participants were allowed to look around
within the VE, the viewpoint could not be changed far enough to give any cues
about the original perspective before the items were moved. Target items consisted
of two sets of objects which alternated between trials and included typical items in
an office environment (e.g. book, cup, bottle, trash can, pencil).
62

Number of target items increased gradually from four to seven. Each
participant went through the same order of twelve trials which were a combination
of three perspectives (0, 90 & 180 degrees) for each of the four numbers of items (4,
5, 6 & 7 items). Target items were selected and moved using the left mouse button
by dragging the object to a new position. The experimenter used a keyboard to
manually select items when the participant had problems using the mouse. This
was evident for almost all participants when very small items had to be selected
(e.g. pencil).
A distance error score was calculated for each target by finding the distance
between the participant’s answer and the item’s original position during the
learning phase, measured in meters. The largest possible error score on the virtual
table was approximately one meter. Distance error and all target positions were
saved as text files for each trial. Rotation of target items was not relevant for this
experiment.
Prior to this study, several brain-injured patients and therapists took part in
preliminary usability trials to test the application and a variety of user interfaces. A
combination of mouse and keyboard controls emerged as the preferred alternative.
44 of the 45 tested participants were able to effortlessly control the application and
drag the target items to their original locations without any instructions at all.
Even patients with little computer experience were easily capable of selecting and
moving items. The experimenter used the keyboard to manually select target items
whenever participants struggled to click on smaller objects. In cases of severe
cognitive impairments or aversion of computer technology, the experimenter is also
able to move the targets via instructions by the participant. This was done for one
patient with no computer experience at all. Patients with severe motor deficits can
use a modified USB-numeric keypad with large keys to move targets onscreen. The
keypad was initially planned as a backup input device, but was not used in any of
the described trials.

3.2.2.4 Procedure
Patients were identified during admission at the clinic and approached during an
initial meeting with the clinical team. In a second 30-minute session the study was
explained in detail and informed written consent was established. Most patients
completed the assessments in 120 to 180 minutes spread across three to four
sessions, each lasting 30 or 60 minutes, depending on the patient’s schedule and
constitution. Sessions were carried out in addition to the normal therapeutic
schedule of the patient. During a first one-hour session (or two 30-minute sessions),
computer experience, block and digit span of the WMS III, Object Perspective
Taking Test, and Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test were completed. In addition,
a target pointing and several orientation tasks were used to assess knowledge of the
clinic buildings. Analysis of the orientation tasks (mental maps task) will be
discussed as part of Experiment 3. In subsequent sessions all participants were
assessed with D2 Test of Attention, Mental Rotations Test and the computerized
VMT. All individual results were immediately analyzed and feedback was given to
the patient after each session. Not all patients were able to complete the full
experimental protocol due to time restrictions or patients being transferred or
discharged from the rehabilitation clinic.

3.2.2.5 Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out using the software PASW 1833. Initial analyses
of VMT-results revealed that the assumption of normality of underlying populations
has been violated for all test results. QQ-Plots and significant results for ShapiroWilk-Tests clearly indicated the non-normal distribution of the population from
which our data was drawn. Using Levene’s Tests, homogeneous variances of our
data sets could only be found after test results from several highly impaired
participants were removed from the analyses. A total of three patients showed very
large variability in their responses and hence were identified for possible removal of
their results from the dataset. However, given the exploratory nature of this study,
it was decided to not remove any data and use non-parametric tests instead.
Consequently, performance on the VMT was analyzed using the non-parametric
Friedman test for repeated measures analysis. Both of the VMT's factors were
collapsed and analyzed individually. Interactions of both factors have not been
addressed in this study. For post-hoc analyses, Bonferroni-adjusted Wilcoxon
Signed-Rank tests were used to find differences between each test condition.
Spearman rank-order correlation coefficients were calculated for the results of the
VMT and all other cognitive tests to assess discriminant and convergent validity.
Bonferroni corrections were used to adjust the α-level for multiple comparisons.

3.2.3 Results
The participants’ performance on the VMT was subject to two Friedman tests,
analyzing each of the test’s two factors separately – perspective change (Figure 16)

and number of target items (Figure 17). When comparing trials with different
numbers of target items, a significant difference in memory performance became
apparent (λ (3) = 27.32, p < 0.001). Trials with different perspective changes also
differed significantly (λ(2) = 42.19, p < 0.001).
Given that both test factors were expected to increase complexity of the
testing situation, it was hypothesized that distance error, which was dependent
variable of all VMT-analyses, would also increase gradually as number of target
items and angular perspective change increase. Consequently, one-sided Wilcoxon
Signed-Rank tests were used to compare all individual conditions for each factor.
Bonferroni adjustments of the α-level were employed for all tests (α = 5%/9 =
0.55%). Significant differences were found for comparisons of number of target
items between five and seven targets (z = -3.48, p < 0.001, n5=43, n7=37, difference
in mean rank = 2.11) and six and seven targets (z = -4.02, p = 0.001, n6=40, n7=37,
difference in mean rank = 2.31). Memory performance in respect to perspective
changes differed significantly between 0 and 90 degrees (z = -5.10, p < 0.001,
n0=n90=43, difference in mean rank = 15.69) and between 0 and 180 degrees (z = 5.43, p < 0.001, n0=n180=43, difference in mean rank = 17.92). All remaining
pairwise comparisons did not show significant differences in the predicted direction.
Total distance errors across all perspective changes and number of targets
were correlated with results from Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, digit and
blockspan, computer experience and D2 Test of Attention. Average distance errors
across all trials with a changed perspective were correlated with Mental Rotations
Test and Object Perspective Taking Test. Spearman’s rank-order correlation
coefficient was used with an adjusted α-level of 0.5% (α = 5%/10). Strong significant
relationships were found between the VMT-scores and immediate and delayed
recall of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (one-sided test). No significant
relationships were found for VMT results and computer experience or VMT and D2
Test of Attention. Only the latter two correlations were analyzed with two-tailed
tests, because there is no rationale for either a positive or a negative relationship
and no significant correlations were expected. Tests of spatial abilities were not
significantly correlated with VMT scores. Detailed results can be found in Table 5.

3.2.4 Discussion
The aim of this present study was to demonstrate the viability of a modular
cognitive task which was implemented in a virtual model of a rehabilitation clinic.
Primarily, this experiment intended to demonstrate the test’s convergent and
66

discriminant validity in a clinical context and to receive usability feedback from a
wide range of brain-injured patients. The task assessed short-term memory and the
ability to imagine different perspectives in three-dimensional space. 45 patients
with a broad range of cognitive deficits were included in this trial to compare test
results with established neuropsychological tests. Further, the participants'
feedback was used to improve interface usability. The VMT was designed to allow
clinicians and researchers to individually target deficits and context of each patient.
The test was created to provide a clinical tool with higher ecological validity than
existing tasks. Further, the test’s setting in three-dimensional virtual space allows
for exact measurements and differentiated visual and statistical analysis of test
results. As such, the test can be integrated into any VE that can be imported and
displayed within the game engine Unity. For the purpose of this experiment the
VMT was implemented in a virtual model of the experimenter’s office. The location
was chosen to replicate the real room where the actual experiment was conducted.
It was expected that test performance on the VMT shows strong significant
correlations with measures of short-term memory (Hypothesis I-b) and visual
memory (Hypothesis I-d). It was also expected that for trials during which a
perspective change is applied, a significant correlation with tests of spatial abilities
is evident. No significant correlation was expected between VMT performance and
measures of attention (Hypothesis I-e). This trial did not assess the extent to which
the VMT possesses ecological validity. Further, it was not evaluated to which extent
the test can be adjusted to fit the individual goals and deficits of each patient.
Rather, the study was a standardized protocol to assess the test’s validity and
feasibility. Ecological relevance and the test’s flexibility were evaluated in
experiments three and four. Based on previous trials conducted by Kozhevnikov and
Hegarty (2001) and King and colleagues (2002) the overall difficulty of the
combination of memory and spatial abilities could not be anticipated. However,
based on the task’s relevance for everyday life, it was expected that both task
factors combined provide an appropriate level of difficulty. This expectation was
based on the assumption that everyday objects and relevant targets often are
dynamic and viewed from multiple perspectives. For example, walking through a
novel environment multiple times will presumably result in different routes,
relevant locations and perspectives each time – exemplarily in the case of searching
for a parked car in a complex scene.
As hypothesized, the VMT error scores showed a strong negative correlation
with scores of the Rey-Osterrieth-Complex-Figure Test (immediate and delayed
recall). Both tests make high demands on visual memory, so that convergent
validity has been established for the VMT and Hypothesis I-c is confirmed. No
significant relationship has been shown between VMT error scores and tests of
spatial abilities (i.e. Hypothesis I-d is not supported). Even after excluding trials
without viewpoint changes and each participant’s first trial with a viewpoint
change from the analysis (as most participants were surprised by the rotation), no
significant correlations were obtained. However, variability for test results of the
Mental Rotations Test and Object Perspective Taking Test has been very high. Due
to the small sample size, N=18 and N=38 for Mental Rotations Test and Object
Perspective Taking Test respectively, and the heterogeneous sample of neurological
patients, further investigations are necessary to establish possible relationships
67

with tests of spatial abilities. No significant correlations were found for VMT
results and digit or block span. While block span and VMT both are expected to
assess the construct of visual working memory, the concept of test scores differs
between both tests. Digit and block span count each test item as either correct or
wrong. Results of the VMT provide much more information so that exact positions
of each target item can be calculated in 3D space. This allows for differentiated
analyses for several types of errors. Errors can occur for rotation of the array of
items (Figure 18-A; i.e. ignoring a perspective change), distance between targets
(Figure 18-B; with correct layout of targets), total shift of the array of items (Figure
18-C; e.g. when misinterpreting foreshortening of camera perspective), swapping
target locations (Figure 18-D), or location of single targets (Figure 18-E; “I forgot
where it was”).

Figure 18. Observed Error Types for VMT

After experiment two was finished, several prototypical applications for data
analysis were developed. During the development process of these analysis tools,
errors D and E (Figure 18) emerged as the most common error types. Combination
of error types did also occur frequently. However, unless an analysis tool has been
finished or a simple dichotomy of correct or false answers has been found for the
VMT results, no direct comparison to digit and block span seems possible. For the
purpose of this study, the absolute distance of the user’s answer to the correct
(changed) position of the target was measured. Several alternative approaches to
error analyses were tested, but none provided satisfying sensitivity for error types.
For example, differences between user answers and correct positions were
calculated as deviations from the common midpoint of the set of targets on a twodimensional grid. Figure 19 shows an example of an analysis tool which calculates
the proportional difference in distances between original target location and correct
answer and the user’s answer respectively. The application has been specifically
developed to run in the Unity editor and read the text files that the VMT produces.
It is intended to integrate this application into the standalone executable of the
VMT so that clinicians can visualize the task results without the need to run the
Unity editor. The tool can visualize the positions of the user’s answers and the
68

correct target locations. Future trials will be directed at making more extensive use
of the large amount of data that the proposed virtual task produces.

Figure 19. Unity-based analysis tool for the VMT

Types of errors also appeared to be related to the participants’ strategy for
memorizing the target locations. Participants reported strategies about using
marks on the wooden (virtual) table, using external cues (e.g. positions of power
outlets and chairs in the scene’s background), learning the relative positions of
targets to each other or simply using a mental picture of the whole scene.
Unfortunately, strategy use was not recorded for each participant so that a
relationship between both variables could not be established. Such additional
information is expected to broaden the use of the proposed cognitive task by
enabling the therapist to teach new strategies to patients after they suffered from
brain injury.
Correlation analysis of test scores for the D2 Test of Attention and VMT did
not reveal any significant relationship. While several patients did show severe
attention deficits, no linear relationship was expected between both tests. In order
to confirm discriminant validity of the VMT, results of this study need to be
replicated with larger and more homogeneous samples of neurological patients and
healthy adults.
The heterogeneous sample was specifically chosen to represent patients with
a wide range of cognitive deficits and purposely included both, healthy and
impaired individuals. While strict test validation is an important aspect which
needs to be expanded upon in upcoming trials, an important goal of this present
study was to explore the usage of such virtual task in a clinical context. Hence, a
more stringent selection of participants in future studies (e.g. right-hemispheric
temporal/parietal lesions, healthy control group) is necessary to draw conclusions
about construct validity and relationship to other psychometric measures. Further,
the memory performance of healthy and brain-injured individuals in more
homogeneous samples could shed light on the controversial role of the human
hippocampus in spatial memory. Either general memory load, as suggested by
69

Shrager and colleagues (2006), or allocentric viewpoint changes (King, et al., 2002),
have been associated with the human hippocampus. The VMT builds upon the tasks
of both groups and extends them for use in everyday clinical training and
assessment. The VMT’s results suggest that memory performance is influenced by
viewpoint change and memory load (i.e. number of target items). However, the
interaction of both factors needs to be evaluated in future trials with less
heterogeneous samples.
Several other task-related aspects need to be evaluated in future trials. To
address a possible confounding factor of incongruent perspectives between real and
VEs, it is necessary to use separate locations for VE and physical space. Changing
the virtual perspective caused confusion among several participants whenever the
virtual rotated perspective conflicted with the real perspective of the participant
sitting in front of the table. The match between real and virtual test environment
was supposed to give the participant a better sense of space during the experiment.
Also, the office room was one of few rooms to which the experimenter had easy
access for measurements and 3D modeling. Further, within the office setting
patients’ exposure to the actual environment was easily controlled by the
experimenter. All participants were exposed to the office for approximately 60
minutes prior to the use of the VMT (30-minute information session, 30-minute
testing session). Future studies will have to address this confounding variable and
evaluate or control the interference that such overlap of real and VEs may cause.
The choice of target items for the VMT is an important parameter which
needs to be controlled in future studies. The task is designed to allow the clinician
to choose targets which are of personal relevance to the patient. However, it is
unclear whether the familiarity and repeated use of target items in consecutive
trials have an effect on the task’s results. For the purpose of this study, item sets
were always alternated between trials. Thus, the occurrence of false memories (i.e.
item positions from past trials) is a possible confounding factor for this study’s
results.
An additional goal of this study was to show that both of the task’s factors,
perspective change and number of target items, contribute towards the difficulty of
each trial. The nonparametric analyses revealed that participants committed the
largest errors for trials with seven target items and generally more errors for trials
with larger perspective changes. No significant differences were found between
trials with five and six target items and between trials with four target items and
all other trials. Even though the task was explained in detail to each participant
prior to starting the first four-item-trials, several participants were surprised by the
task’s mechanics, especially perspective changes. It can be assumed that task
performance on the first trials did not reflect the participant’s true abilities, but
rather was affected by the novelty of the task. A practice trial or an initial
simulation of perspective changes need to be considered for future trials. The
absence of a significant difference between trials with five and six target items can
possibly be explained by the use of biased item constellations. Item locations were
randomly chosen during the VMT’s development cycle by using a random number
generator and thus could falsely result in non-linear difficulty progression
throughout the testing process. As a consequence, the influence of target distances
70

and complex item constellations (e.g. items being easier to remember by standing
close to each other or in a triangle arrangement) on trial difficulty need to be
evaluated in future trials.
The current study provided a first-hand experience of how participants act in
a realistic, semi-familiar VE. Further, the office setting enabled the experimenter to
draw comparisons to the real environment whenever participants were skeptical
about test results or the nature of the task. These situations were crucial for
showing the effects of a cognitive task with high ecological validity. While this
comparison cannot be made during day-to-day clinical use of the test, it was
beneficial for clearly showing the task’s transparency and evoking patient responses
that support the test’s ecological relevance. More specifically, this trial provides
evidence for the strong effect that the VMT’s high ecological relevance had on the
patients’ awareness of their cognitive deficits. Five cases were identified in which
patients with mnestic deficits went through all well-established pencil and paper
assessments with constant denial of their deficits. Even when faced with extremely
poor test results on the Rey-Osterrieth-Complex Figure Test or block and digit
span, no deficit awareness was evident. However, when these participants were
assessed with the VMT, they were confronted with a task that is believable,
transparent and easily comparable to relevant tasks of daily life. When faced with
their poor results on the VMT, emotional outbursts and breakdowns were evoked,
mostly among five out of 45 participants. To illustrate this further, one of the
participants concluded, “I can’t believe I’m not able to do this. Even a [expletive]
third-grader can do this”. However, it is important to note that these reactions
require additional care when administering such virtual task. Awareness of deficits
is a vital aspect of cognitive rehabilitation, but without proper support from an
experienced therapist during and after an emotional experience like this, the
positive outcome of a patient’s rehabilitation is at stake. This also leads to the
conclusion that unguided use of such virtual task without the patient’s insight into
their own deficits is not recommended at this stage and therapeutic potential of
tasks with high ecological relevance needs to be extensively tested in future trials.
Though, from a clinical perspective it is to be expected that patients who are still
denying their cognitive deficits when being discharged from a rehabilitation clinic
will struggle when returning to the challenges of daily life. Hence, an early
confrontation with their own deficits appears to be in the patient’s best interest in
order to actively partake in rehabilitation. It is such confrontations in a controlled
environment (i.e. under supervision of a clinician) which can make a realistic VR
test a tremendously helpful tool during and after inpatient rehabilitation. Hence,
patients could be introduced to the VMT during inpatient rehabilitation and
complete multiple sessions during which they solve tasks of varying difficulty. Once
the patient is familiar with the test and it can be assumed that the patient is aware
of his/her own deficits based on verbal assessment, unsupervised use within the
clinic and outside of the clinic could be considered over time. Future trials need to
more systematically explore the effect of developed cognitive tests on deficit
insights. More specifically, test sessions need to be recorded to provide evidence
which task components or test results can influence a patient’s deficit denial. The
presented anecdotal evidence can merely serve as first indication of the potential of
the VMT and needs further substantiation in future trials.

71

The development of the VMT task has been focused on creating a modular
task which can be easily placed into any VE. The workflow of creating a VE has
been refined to allow for quick prototyping of virtual spaces in a matter of hours
(see chapter 2.3). The interactive environments are not economical from a
performance standpoint so that a high-end PC is currently required to run the
applications. However, time is of the essence when a brain-injured patient starts a
four to six-week rehabilitation program. The creation of a detailed version of the
virtual office in which the assessment has been carried out took a total of four
hours. Consequently, it is easily possible to create to scale models of patients’ home
environments in a matter of one to two days. The exact workflow, performance
issues of such VEs and their usage during rehabilitation are described in more
detail in the following chapter.
Besides the obvious use of testing and training spatial memory, other
application fields for the VMT need to be evaluated in future trials. Target items,
item scale and environments can be easily changed to fit the patient’s needs. The
task-scale can be adjusted to move around furniture or any virtual item. It is also
possible to use the application to train memory strategies by repeatedly requiring
the patient to place targets at strategic places in the environment. While the
targets were always moved to fixed locations after two minutes, learning duration
and changed positions can be manipulated by the experimenter. Several parameters
have been implemented to randomly move around targets for each trial in order to
promote long-term use of the application, e.g. as a training application instead of a
diagnostic tool. The transfer of trained skills to tasks of daily life will be evaluated
in upcoming clinical trials. Stereoscopic rendering of the VE (anaglyph red/cyan)
has been implemented, but was not used for the experiment to avoid unnecessary
risk for patients with epilepsy, and eyestrain for patients with nystagmus or other
visual deficits. An advantage of the Unity game engine is the uncomplicated use of
the application for online assessment. The virtual task and environments can easily
be embedded in any html-page. The only aspect of the task which needs to be
modified is the process of saving the task results to an online SQL database. This
makes it possible for patients to easily continue training after they are discharged
from any rehabilitation program and deficit awareness and emotional stability have
been achieved.
In conclusion, the proposed VMT has been shown to help several highlyimpaired individuals to realize their cognitive deficits. This can be seen as a first
indication of the test’s ecological validity. Usability and user feedback have been
excellent throughout so that further trials and extended use of the application
during context-sensitive cognitive rehabilitation seem justified. However, when
using the VMT with patients with cognitive impairments, continuous support by
experienced therapists is recommended to avoid frustration. The test’s transparent
nature and realism of the VE appear very helpful for motivating patients, but can
also have adverse effects when individuals abruptly realize that their cognitive
abilities
have
suffered

event.

3.3 Experiment 3 - Evaluation of workflow and pointing task
VEs (VEs) have seen increasing use in rehabilitation and therapy over the last two
decades (Rose, Brooks, & Rizzo, 2005). By combining VEs with immersive displays
and natural interfaces, VR applications have become possible for a wide range of
therapeutic scenarios. A more detailed overview over VR applications, their clinical
usage, advantages and disadvantages has been made in a previous chapter (see
chapter 1.5). Despite their advantages, VEs cannot be considered mainstream
applications for therapy and rehabilitation yet. Development of VEs is considered a
costly and time-consuming process and cost-benefit analyses for VR therapy tools
are still rare. The following evaluation has been conducted at the Neurology
Department of the Asklepios Rehabilitation Clinic, Schaufling, Germany, between
October 2010 and April 2011. The results of this study have been published at the
International Conference on Virtual Rehabilitation 2010, Zurich, Switzerland
(Koenig, Dünser, Bartneck, Dalrymple-Alford, & Crucian, 2011).
The aim of this experiment is twofold. Firstly, the proposed workflow for
creating VEs is tested with four randomly selected rooms. While the workflow is
based on a specific set of software which was selected to match the experimenter’s
experience, this study is aiming to reveal whether this development process is
suitable to create high-fidelity VEs within a timeframe that is appropriate for
clinical use. The realism of the VEs is then assessed by a recognition survey among
staff members of a rehabilitation hospital. It is expected that the realism of the VE
is critical for the patient to recognize the environment. After a neurological incident
patients often spend several weeks or months in hospitals and rehabilitation clinics.
Enabling a patient to train in a familiar environment which they miss and
desperately wish to return to is expected to be a very motivating factor.
Secondly, a pointing task has been created to test the spatial orientation
ability of the user. It is a goal of this study to evaluate whether pointing task
performance is equivalent in a real and VE (Hypothesis I-f). Before the task can be
integrated in individualized VEs during cognitive rehabilitation, its ability to assess
relevant behavior needs to be tested. Once this equivalence has been established,
the test’s utility for clinical decision-making can be explored in a larger randomized
controlled trial. For experiment three it is specifically hypothesized that each of the
four selected VEs can be created in less than a workday (i.e. eight hours;
Hypothesis IV-a). Further, each VE is recognized with above chance probability
(>50%). For this purpose it is assumed that there is a 50% chance of guessing
whether the location was one of the previously shown locations (i.e. forced yes/no
choice). Lastly, it is hypothesized that distance, height and angular judgments of
the pointing task are equivalent in real and VEs. Despite evidence of
underestimating distances in VEs (Witmer & Kline, 1998) the underlying factors of
this phenomenon have not been fully explored yet. Due to the high visual quality of
the developed VEs, the research hypothesis of equivalence between real and VEs
was used.

73

3.3.1 Workflow Test
To test the proposed workflow four separate locations within the Asklepios
Rehabilitation Clinic, Schaufling, Germany, were randomly chosen and modeled.
The exact workflow has been described in chapter 2.3. The choice of environments
was based on a random selection from all rooms and corridors within the clinic.
Each VE and the corresponding real-world photograph can be found in Figure 20.

Figure 20. Screenshots (left) and photos (right)

Time to complete each VE was measured from the first photograph to the
execution of the finished Unity application (Table 6). All environments were ready
for immediate use by a patient. When using this workflow for a patient’s home or
workplace, the number of rooms, necessary detail and additional travel time to the
real location have to be taken into account. Patient and caregivers have to be
briefed and the clinical team needs to agree on therapeutic goals in order to
implement those goals into the VE. Nonetheless, modeling a small apartment or one
floor of a residential house is still possible within the given timeframe of 48 hours
after the patient has been admitted to the rehabilitation clinic. With constantly
evolving software and a growing library of reusable furniture models, the VEs’
realism and pace at which they are created are steadily increasing. However, for the
given time estimates it has to be taken into account that the measurements,
modeling, and task integration have been conducted by the experimenter who has
approximately 2 years of experience with the workflow. If the same development
effort was to be done by somebody unfamiliar with the software or proficient with
related software, the time to complete each functional environment might vary
considerably.

74

3.3.2 VE Recognition
The realism of all produced VEs has been evaluated by testing how participants
recognized each location and how pictures of real and virtual locations were
associated with each other. 43 therapists, employees and interns (12 male - 31
female; average age 31.95 years) were shown the four screenshots as depicted in
Fig. 19. On average, participants had been working at the clinic for 74.2 months
(STD = 91.6, range: 2 weeks - 23 years). Staff members were chosen over braininjured patients due to the fact that familiar environments are relevant to this
thesis. Ultimately, patients are expected to recognize the home or work
environment which has been familiar to them for months or years. On the contrary,
patients only spend days or few weeks at the rehabilitation hospital. Hence, staff
members seemed more appropriate to evaluate the recognition of a familiar
environment among distracting items. However, it has to be noted that recognition
rates of brain-injured patients cannot be estimated based on this data. Though,
anecdotal evidence suggests that a clinical sample similarly recognizes familiar
environments unless severe memory deficits prevent the patient from encoding or
retrieving the information about the environment. Specifically, all participants
except one severely impaired patient recognized the familiar virtual model of the
rehabilitation clinic while using the point task (see chapter 3.3.3 below).
Screenshots of the environments were presented on the 7-inch-screen of a
Samsung Galaxy Tab tablet PC without time restrictions. Locations A and B were
correctly identified by almost all participants (Table 6, identification rate).
Locations C and D were more generic and more often mistaken for similar-looking
wards and corridors. Because some of the locations were not familiar to interns and
new employees, an additional recognition task was used. After showing the four
screenshots, 20 real photographs were presented to each employee. Participants
were instructed to recognize each scene which was shown on the previous four
screenshots. 16 distractor items and the four correct photos (as seen in Figure 20)
were shown in the same order for each participant. Recognition rate across all
locations was 94.1%, so that almost all participants recognized all four locations
(Table 6, recognition rate). During rehabilitation, patients will be faced with very
familiar interactive environments and sounds instead of photographs which should
further increase the familiarity of the VEs.

3.3.3 Validity evaluation – Pointing task
As previously described, four VEs were created to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed workflow. Before these VEs can be used in a clinical context, cognitive
tasks have to be embedded in each environment. To explore such clinical use and
investigate the validity of collected data, one of the four environments was chosen
for a virtual orientation task. Neurological patients were recruited to interact with
the VE and point towards unseen targets in a real and virtual scenario within the
clinic building. This test intended to assess the patients’ mental representations of
their surroundings. If mental maps of real and VEs are equivalent, as assessed
through the pointing task, the virtual task’s data can easily be used with a patient’s
individual VE to assess orientation performance in locations outside of the
rehabilitation clinic (i.e. home or workplace).

3.3.3.1 Participants
31 patients (16 male, 15 female; average age: 43.9 years; age range: 18-65 years) at
the rehabilitation clinic Asklepios Clinic Schaufling, Germany, took part in this
clinical trial. Patients with severe traumatic brain injury (3), subarachnoid
hemorrhage (2), brain tumor (4), hippocampal sclerosis (1), stroke (8, mostly righthemispheric), normal pressure hydrocephalus (1), syringomyelia (1), multiple
sclerosis (3), anaphylactic shock (1), idiopathic epilepsy (2), cerebral encephalitis (1),
cerebral hemorrhage (1) and four patients from non-neurologic departments were
recruited for this study. All patients were able to give informed, written consent.
Availability of patients, inclusion and exclusion criteria were discussed with
clinicians at the hospital. Based on these discussions it was decided to include a
wide range of neurological patients instead of limiting the recruitment to patients
with specific lesions of the righthemispheric temporal and parietal cortex (i.e. brain
lesions specific to deficits in memory, orientation and spatial abilities).

3.3.3.2 Procedure
For this within-subjects design each participant went through the same order of
assessments for a total of approximately one hour. Patients were briefed about the
experiment, signed a consent form and completed pen&paper and VE-based
versions of a pointing task.

3.3.3.3

Task and materials

The pointing task included eight highly familiar target locations within the clinic
which were not visible from the testing room (e.g. therapy rooms, clinic entrance,
swimming pool). Targets were skipped if the location was unknown to the patient.
For each target participants were given the target name and an A4-sheet of paper
with a circle (diameter = 14cm) drawn in the center of the paper. The participants
were instructed to imagine the middle of the circle as their current location. The
circle was used to mark the direction towards the target. In addition, participants
were asked about the linear distance towards the target and the difference in height
between the floor at their current location and the floor at the target.

76

The computer-based pointing task was displayed on a 24-inch monitor, 60cm
in front of the participant. The experiment was carried out with the same PC which
was used to create the VEs (hexa-core CPU, 8GB memory, 2GB NVidia GTX 460
graphics card). The task environment was situated at a different location than the
pen&paper test, but still familiar to all patients (Figure 20-D). Participants were
not allowed to move away from their virtual location but were able to look around
using the arrow keys of a keyboard. A red dot in the middle of the screen was
explained to be the marker for pointing towards the target. The virtual viewpoint
had to be moved by the participant so that the red dot pointed exactly towards the
target. The participants were told to imagine the red dot to be similar to their index
finger for pointing. After choosing a direction, the participants were asked again for
distance and height difference for each target. Order of targets for both pointing
tasks was identical for each participant. No feedback about pointing performance
was given until the end of the test session.

3.3.3.4 Results
Angular deviation from target directions, distance and height judgments were
averaged across all eight targets and subject to detailed analysis. Absolute values
were used for angular deviation and height difference. A percentage measure was
used for distance estimations (100% equals true distance). Initial Levene’s tests
revealed that the assumption of homogeneity of variances was violated for the
angular deviation measure. Additionally, significant Shapiro-Wilk tests indicated
that our data for all three variables were drawn from non-normally distributed
populations. Consequently, non-parametric analyses were used throughout this
study. Statistical equivalence can be established using the procedures of Tryon
(2001) and Tryon and Lewis (2008). However, these methods rely on the calculation
of t-values for confidence intervals. There is no established test procedure for nonparametric analysis of equivalence yet. Thus, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests were
performed and effect sizes according to Morris and DeShon’s equation 8 (2002) were
calculated (Table 7). Non-significant differences and very small effect sizes for all
three measures were hypothesized in order to support the equivalence of real and
virtual mental maps.

3.3.4 Discussion
The employed analyses do not allow for firm conclusions about the equivalence of
virtual and real environments, but non-significant differences and very small effect
sizes are expected if both scenarios are very similar. All results show a very large
variability. This can possibly be attributed to the inclusion of patients with a wide
range of brain injuries. Future experiments need to selectively recruit patients with
deficits in spatial orientation and memory deficits.
When patients pointed towards unseen targets, their judgment errors did
not show significant differences in VEs and real environments. The resulting effect
size is very small. Both groups committed similar errors and used similar strategies
to find target directions. For example, when misjudging the first target, the
following targets were shifted in accordance with the first pointing error (i.e. all
targets misjudged by the same angle). When debriefing participants, the most
common applied strategy was to mentally walk the path towards the target and
update bearings during the mental wayfinding process. However, this strategy
cannot be applied for distance judgments. Thus, most participants reported to have
no strategy for distance or height judgments. Only few individuals used floor
numbers and room heights as an indicator for total height difference between target
and current location.
The small and medium effect sizes for distance and height estimations
respectively, suggest that length is generally not judged equally in real and virtual
scenarios. Moreover, several participants tremendously overestimated distances in
both environments (i.e. >500%). In order to account for these outliers, medians were
calculated for both groups (Table 7). Performance within the VE indicates that most
participants underestimated the true distances towards all targets which is in line
with previous studies (Furness & Henry, 1993; Witmer & Kline, 1998). Distance
judgments in the real environment were mostly accurate. This difference cannot be
explained by any obvious technical aspects of the VE. Patients were not able to
walk through the real and VE in order to avoid the difference in visual and
proprioceptive feedback during locomotion. Visual quality of the VEs was high when
compared to earlier studies (Waller, 2000; Witmer & Kline, 1998). Unfortunately,
no systematic assessment of judgment strategies was conducted. Hence, it cannot
be determined whether participants used different strategies to judge virtual and
real directions and distances.
Generally, mental maps of our sample of neurological patients appeared to
be comparable between real environment and VE. However, dimensions of these
maps differed considerably so that mental maps based on VEs were reported to be
smaller compared to their real-world counterparts. Results of this study indicate
that further studies are needed to explain the large variance in orientation
performance. Such studies should aim to recruit patients with more strictly defined
inclusion criteria, particularly addressing lesion size and location. Further, studies
including healthy participants can be useful to establish a baseline of navigation
performance in complex environments. Large environments were subject to
experimental investigation in the past (Darken & Sibert, 1996; Waller, 2000;
Witmer, et al., 1996). However, there is no clear evidence available that compares
78

and explains navigation behavior and distance judgments in complex real and VEs.
Experiments were either conducted in non-realistic environments (Darken & Sibert,
1996), did only address transfer of knowledge (Witmer, et al., 1996) or did not use
comparable real-world environments and VEs for assessment of spatial knowledge
(Waller, 2000).
As in previous studies (see chapters 3.1 and 3.2) the gathered data is of such
complexity that further evaluations are necessary to fully benefit from the complex
virtual scenarios which can be created with modern computer technology. Realizing
the proposed workflow for VE-development builds the foundation for extending this
approach to several applied fields. Yet, it is the quality and quantity of produced
data which need to be further investigated before patient-centered VEs become
accepted tools in rehabilitation.

3.3.5 Conclusion
Cognitive rehabilitation is dealing with the individual background and deficits of
each patient. A context-sensitive approach to rehabilitation has already been
proposed (Ylvisaker, 2003) and described in detail (see Chapter 1.1). VR technology
has also gained momentum over the last decades (Rose, et al., 2005), especially in
the area of rehabilitation. However, given the labor-intensity of creating VEs, the
use of these tools is still not common in a context-sensitive rehabilitation approach.
Creating individual VEs for each patient to provide a relevant training scenario
requires the cost-effective, timely production of these tools. This current study tests
the workflow to achieve realistic, to scale models of real environments (as described
in Chapter 2.3). The development process has been demonstrated in a random sample
of four complex virtual rooms, each taking less than six hours to complete. The
finished environments were realistic enough for users to recognize and to associate
with their real world counterparts. Virtual tasks in several cognitive domains have
been implemented within the VEs for use in therapy or training. These tasks enable
patients to train in meaningful environments that are based on the personal
circumstances of the brain-injured patient. High fidelity and personal relevance of
VEs are the basis for clinicians to make more accurate decisions about individual
performance outside of the rehabilitation setting.
In summary, it has been demonstrated that user-centered VEs can be
developed efficiently for use in context-sensitive rehabilitation. With a fast
development process and sophisticated data collection capabilities, VEs provide a
useful alternative to traditional tests and trainings. Future investigations need to
explore the conceptualization of VE-based datasets and further evaluate the
validity of collected data.

3.4 Experiment 4 - Single case trial
The final evaluation of this dissertation has been conducted between February 2011
and April 2011 at the Asklepios Rehabilitation Clinic, Schaufling, Germany. Patient
HA was recruited for a single-case trial to evaluate the proposed workflow and
usage of the embedded cognitive tasks. The patient was chosen for this trial based
on several factors. Firstly, patient HA and her parents were willing to actively
participate in this trial and provide access to the parents’ home. Secondly, the
patient’s therapy goals were well-aligned with the content that can be provided by
the VMT. By developing a model of the parents’ house the patient could train to
return home and complete tasks independently (e.g. preparing a meal). Lastly, the
patient’s health care plan was expected to pay for at least four weeks of neurologic
rehabilitation which provided ample time for multiple training sessions.
It was the intention of this trial to apply the workflow and cognitive tasks
during the day-to-day schedule of a brain-damaged patient (Aim 8). It was
hypothesized that the VE relevant to the patient’s therapy goals was developed
within eight hours of development time (Hypothesis IV-a). Further, the cognitive
training was expected to be adapted to HA’s therapy goals (Aim 7). Lastly, the
cognitive tasks were hypothesized to be of adequate difficulty for HA’s training by
not showing any floor or ceiling effect (Hypothesis II-a).

3.4.1 Subject
HA, 29 years of age, female, right-handed, shows extensive damage of both frontallobes and the left temporal lobe after a very severe traumatic brain injury in early
2010. HA’s initial state is characterized by cerebral edema, brain stem contusion,
and traumatic subdural hematoma. A bifrontal decompression craniotomy and
hematoma relief are also reported alongside with initial mutism, severe autonomic
crises, and spastic tetraparesis. After an initial coma of approximately four weeks
HA was transferred to early rehabilitation about five weeks after the incident. Nine
months after the accident HA was admitted to the neurology department of a
rehabilitation clinic. Initially, HA was very passive and did not engage in
conversations or social activities on her own. However, she adequately responded to
questions and requests, albeit very slowly. Her motivation to practice and engage in
therapies was low. HA spent most of the day in bed watching TV. Based on HA’s
tertiary education and professional experience, her premorbid intelligence was
expected to be above average, especially for the cognitive domains of spatial
reasoning and spatial memory. During initial neuropsychological tests, HA’s verbal
short-term and working memory were tested to be below the age norm. Further,
HA’s episodic memory several weeks before and after the traumatic brain injury
was not accessible. Visual/spatial working memory was above average as tested by
the WMS III’s Block Span forward and backward (Wechsler, 1945/1997). HA was
repeatedly able to reproduce sequences of seven items (blocks) in forward and
reversed order. Spatial reasoning was assessed by the OPTT (Hegarty & Waller,
2004) in which she received a score in the first quartile of all 41 patients tested
during the clinical trials in Germany (HA’s average deviation 26.75 degrees, group

80

median 35.46 degrees). In summary, patient HA’s abilities to remember events from
the past and learn new events were compromised. Also, her motivation and social
behavior were severely dysfunctional. Judging spatial relationships and layouts
was one of her strengths and was still above average even with the traumatic brain
injury.

3.4.2 Workflow
HA’s participation in this clinical trial was discussed with her, her family and the
clinical team approximately two weeks after admission to the clinic. Her
neurological rehabilitation was likely to be extended for at least eight weeks, so
that prolonged training with the VMT was expected to be feasible. In order to
promote independent living at home, HA’s training goal was to prepare a breakfast
in her home environment. Consequently, location of relevant items and correct
order of items were chosen as training tasks. After informed written consent was
established, the home environment, particularly the kitchen, was measured and
photographed during a home visit. Floor plans of the building were scanned and
imported into Autodesk Design Review. The modeling process is depicted in Figure
21. The top left scene in Figure 21 shows the integration of the building’s floorplan
into a SketchUp model. All subsequent scenes document the modeling of the
building structure and interior details. The VMT was added to the VE as described
in chapter 2.4.3. Twelve food and kitchen-related items were defined as target items.
The actual development process took a total of eight hours. However, due to clinical
obligations these eight hours of development were carried out over the course of a
week. After this time period the environment was recognizable by the patient and
the cognitive tasks were usable and ready for training sessions. However, after the
initial development effort additional details and decorative items were added to the
environment in order to showcase the finished application outside of the clinic
environment, on websites and conferences. The application and a photograph of the
real environment can be found in Figure 22.

3.4.3 Training protocol
Prior to using the VMT, HA completed a series of neuropsychological tests identical
to the protocol of Experiment two (see Chapter 3.2.2.2 for details). Due to the
experimenter’s commitment to clinical work outside of the single case study, the
development process of the individual training environment was spread out over
the course one week. While the virtual model of the home environment was still
being developed, HA started using the standard version of the VMT. The VMT’s
standard version has been developed for evaluating the test with a larger clinical
sample and is set in the virtual office room in which all assessments and training
82

sessions of this trial took place. As soon as the patient’s virtual home environment
was fully functional both versions were used in parallel during training sessions. A
total of nine training sessions were conducted over the course of four weeks. The
first five sessions used the standard VMT and the remaining four sessions made use
of the individualized VMT. Each session lasted between 30 and 60 minutes,
consisting of 5 to 15 VMT trials per session (average 9.22). The frequency of
training sessions varied considerably over the course of the study and depended on
HA’s therapy schedule. Once HA’s mobility and motivation increased,
physiotherapy sessions were of highest priority. Consequently, VMT training
sessions were reduced to two sessions in the third week and one session during the
last week of training. VMT sessions generally were scheduled towards the end of
the daily therapy plan, because physiotherapy sessions occupied most of the
morning and early afternoon. Due to time restraints the training was discontinued
after the fourth week.

3.4.4 Results
As with HA’s overall performance, VMT results varied substantially depending on
her motivation, rehabilitative progress, and length of her daily therapy plan. The
initial data presented here is taken from the trials using the VMT’s standard
version. Generally, a slight reduction in error scores for all trials involving
viewpoint rotation and no rotation (Figure 23) and for trials involving 0 and 90
degree rotations (Figure 24) can be seen. However, given the low number of data
points none of these differences justify the use of inferential statistics. No clear
pattern emerged for trials with 180 degree viewpoint shifts. Further, no trend can
be seen when trials involving four, five, six, and seven target items are analyzed
(Figure 25). The average error score across all trials decreased from 0.296m for the
first session to 0.215m during the ninth session. The error score represents the
average offset of the placed target items from their original locations across all
items of each trial, measured in meters.

The individualized VMT was only used during four training sessions so that
statistical analyses are not justified. Session eight only consisted of one
individualized VMT trial, as HA was too exhausted from earlier therapies to
continue her training. The overall average error scores show a slight increase over
the course of the four sessions. Average error scores are highest in session nine
(0.268m; Figure 26). Comparing error scores for trials with different numbers of
target items (Figure 27) and different perspective changes (Figure 28) does not yield
conclusive results. It appears that performance in trials of low difficulty (i.e. 4
target items, no rotation) increases over time while trials of higher difficulty show
large variability with the largest error scores during session nine.

Results for an alternate use of the VMT indicate improvements over the
course of three sessions. HA was asked to collect items from the kitchen table and
put them in the order that is needed for meal preparation. Using six target items
HA was able to correctly place the items for session seven and nine. During session
eight five out of six items were placed correctly. More importantly, using seven
target items HA achieved three, five and seven correctly placed items respectively
(Figure 29). The order of items remained the same across sessions. While the
constellation of all targets is relevant for the normal use of the VMT, targets only
need to be put in order for this VMT variation. Because of the easier structure of
this task, it is expected that these improvements are due to a learning effect.

Even though not enough data have been collected to statistically analyze
HA’s performance with the individualized VE, valuable insights about the paradigm
86

have been gained during this single case trial. Most importantly, despite HA’s
passiveness, she was highly motivated to use the VMT. HA did not talk on her own
nor showed any emotional reactions prior to starting her training. When first
confronted with the individual version of the VMT, HA smiled and said that she
knows the environment. She was able to identify furniture and several items in the
VE. She also started to engage in conversations about the individualized
application, its development and use.
Further, it was shown that the VMT is flexible enough to train the
individual therapy goals of HA. Firstly, target items were scattered across the
kitchen so that HA had to memorize their locations. Secondly, target items were
aligned in a specific order and HA had to re-arrange the order in which the items
would be used for specific tasks (e.g. preparing a meal). Thirdly, it is possible to
scatter items around the environment and the user has to place them back to the
same location repeatedly. This can be used to train patients to systematically
organize items in their surroundings. Since HA already started to remember the
location of items around the kitchen, the third training approach was not used.

3.4.5 Discussion
Despite the lack of data to statistically analyze HA’s progress with the VMT over
the course of the training, the development and use of the VMT can be considered
successful. Despite the prolonged development process, the total time to develop the
individual home environment (Figure 21 and Figure 22) was within the time limit
set forth in Hypothesis IV-a. The virtual scenario was realistic enough to be
recognized by HA. The relevance of the scene motivated her to use the training
repeatedly and engage in conversations about the development and use of the
application. Her training motivation and emotional responses when HA first saw
the application is the most important outcome of this trial. However, her general
increase in motivation and social activity throughout her rehabilitation might be
best explained by the comprehensive therapy plan that HA received in many
domains including physiotherapy and speech language therapy. The cognitive VMT
training might have had a positive influence on the rehabilitation outcome, but
currently this contribution cannot be quantified. Further trials with a more
structured data collection are required to perform time-series analyses and evaluate
the efficacy of the VE-based cognitive training.
Among the many components of the development cycle of such individualized
cognitive training, the measurement and photographing of the actual environment
were found to be the most labor-intensive. For future trials, a more automated
approach of collecting information about the real environment is desirable.
Specifically, the amount of time that the developer has to spend at the patient’s
home or workplace has to be reduced in order to minimize interference with the
family’s privacy or the employer’s work routine. Preferably, an intuitive procedure
would allow the patient’s family or employer to capture the information themselves
and send it to the developer for reconstruction of the environment’s geometry and
textures. Such procedure could involve the use of a depth-sensing camera (i.e.
Microsoft Kinect) in order to capture the real scene appropriately.

4 DISCUSSION
The goal of this dissertation is the development and evaluation of cognitive tasks
targeting navigation, orientation and spatial memory. The developed applications
are based on elements of context-sensitive and process-specific rehabilitation by
combining individualized virtual environments (VEs) and standardized cognitive
tasks. The patient’s individual context is incorporated through the use of
meaningful, unique virtual environments VEs. Process-specificity is achieved by the
use of cognitive tasks that target specific cognitive domains such as spatial and
working memory. This development process is carried out by an experienced virtual
reality (VR) developer who provides the individualized application to clinicians for
daily use in rehabilitation. This training approach is expected to motivate patients,
target relevant rehabilitation goals and provide valuable information to the
clinician by accurately simulating situations in which the patient is expected to live
independently.
The validity and feasibility of these tasks was evaluated during four
experimental trials. During the initial stage of this dissertation experiment one
tested the navigation ability of healthy adults in real and VEs. The remaining three
trials were conducted at the Asklepios Rehabilitation Clinic, Schaufling, Germany.
By recruiting patients with a wide range of neurological deficits it was intended to
evaluate the developed tasks with users of varying cognitive and motor abilities.
Due to the complexity and high variability of the collected data the quantitative
outcomes of all trials did not produce conclusive evidence. However, the user
feedback was very positive throughout and patients found the tasks easy to
understand. Five patients were able to gain insight into their cognitive deficits by
using the VMT during experiment two. This outcome is of central importance to this
dissertation, because deficit awareness appears to be relevant for the successful
outcome of cognitive rehabilitation (Ownsworth & Clare, 2006). If assessed patients
do not realize the nature of their deficits and doubt the outcomes of the
neuropsychological tests, their motivation for long-term cognitive training is
expected to be low.
An additional relevant outcome was achieved while training a patient with
severe traumatic brain injury. The individualized VE during experiment four
encouraged patient HA to actively engage in conversations, show motivation
towards continued use of the application and show positive emotions during
practice sessions. Given the patient’s passive state, lack of emotions and low
motivation due to massive frontal lobe damage, these achievements are remarkable
and suggest that the concept of individualized training tasks can be of high value
for cognitive rehabilitation. A more detailed discussion of how the experimental
trials address the aims and hypotheses of this dissertation can be found in the
following chapter. Moreover, the thesis’ limitations, potential, and future research
will be discussed.

88

4.1 Aims
4.1.1 Aim 1
It is the primary aim of this thesis to develop a set of cognitive tasks targeting
navigation ability, orientation ability, and spatial memory.
Each of the cognitive tasks has been implemented in the game engine Unity. They
can be imported as unity-packages to be embedded into any VE that can be
displayed in Unity. The VNT was the first development effort to be used with
healthy adults. Its implementation in the virtual model of the Erskine building at
the University of Canterbury was carried out over the course of three months. The
task consists of a set of navigation targets which can be placed at any location
within the VE. The user’s ability to navigate from one target to the next is recorded
and can be analyzed within the Unity editor.
The VMT is a cognitive task which combines elements of short-term memory
and perspective-taking ability. The development of the task was planned as an
iterative process which involved series of user testing of patients and therapists at
the Asklepios Rehabilitation Clinic, Schaufling, Germany. The task can be
customized within the Unity editor in order to create relevant training sessions for
each patient.
The pointing task requires the user to point towards unseen targets. It was
used as part of the VNT-trial and also in a separate study in which patients at
Schaufling completed the task in the real clinic environment and its virtual
counterpart. All three tasks can be used individually or in combination within a
therapy session, depending on the patient’s deficits. The tasks can be configured
and set up in any VE within Unity prior to a session. Detailed descriptions of each
task can be found in chapter 2.4. By completing the development of the tasks and
evolving each application through continuous testing with healthy participants and
neurological patients, this aim has been successfully achieved.

4.1.2 Aim 2
It is an additional aim to assess each cognitive task’s validity in an experimental
trial.
Four experiments have been carried out as part of this thesis. Experiment one was
intended to assess navigation performance of healthy adults in a complex real-world
environment and a virtual to-scale copy of the scene. This trial involved the
development and testing of the VNT and a first prototype of the pointing task.
Healthy adults were recruited for this initial data collection due to the prototypical
nature of the VNT assessment, the exhausting study protocol and the limited
availability of neurological patients in Christchurch, New Zealand. During the
initial stage of this dissertation, the individualization of each participant’s
environment was not a major goal yet, so that each participant was exposed to the

89

same virtual/real scenario. By showing that navigation performance is equivalent in
real and virtual spaces, this experiment was expected to provide evidence that the
VNT can be utilized in a clinical setting. The results of this trial indicate that
navigation through complex environments cannot easily be assessed with
traditional measures of spatial abilities. Further trials need to evaluate the
influence of environmental difficulty parameters (i.e. visibility of landmarks,
familiarity of the environment, number of alternate routes, etc.) and navigation
choices on the user’s performance. Also, an evaluation of navigation performance
with brain-injured patients is necessary to show the VNT’s relevance for clinical
decision-making.
Experiments two, three and four were conducted at the Asklepios Clinic,
Schaufling, Germany. The purpose of the second and third experiment was to test
the VMT and pointing task with a diverse sample of neurological patients. The
intention was to receive patient feedback about task difficulty and user interaction
while also collecting data about the validity of the cognitive tasks. While the
outcome of the validity evaluations did not provide clear results throughout, the
concept of the VMT did show significant correlations with traditional measures of
short-term memory. Further evaluations with more homogeneous samples of
neurological patients (e.g. lesion to right temporal/parietal cortex) are expected to
provide additional evidence for the test’s validity. More importantly, experiment
two clearly showed the importance of the VMT’s transparent nature that closely
resembles tasks that patients recognize from their daily life. A total of five
participants were able to gain insight into their cognitive deficits by using the VMT.
Experiment three was successful in replicating results of previous
experiments in which a pointing task resulted in participants underestimating
virtual distances as compared to actual real-world measurements. This experiment
also demonstrated that VEs created with the proposed workflow (chapter 2.3) are
realistic and resemble real-world environments accurately. Healthy participants
recognized the environments in at least 88% of all cases.
Experiment four applied the previously tested cognitive assessments to a
brain-injured patient. This single-case trial was planned to demonstrate that an
individualized VE can be created within the proposed timeframe of eight hours and
that task content and difficulty are appropriate for clinical use with a patient.
While the development of the VE was interrupted by clinical obligations of the
experimenter, the total development time was within the set time limit. Patient
HA’s therapy goal to return home and live independently without the need for
assistance in activities of daily life was integrated into the VMT. VNT and pointing
task were not relevant for the patient, as navigation and spatial orientation were
left unimpaired after HA’s severe traumatic brain injury. Because of the
unpredictable nature of neurological rehabilitation, patient HA’s focus shifted
towards physio- and occupational therapy as time progressed. Therefore, only few
VMT sessions were conducted and not enough data was gathered to analyze the
results statistically. Nonetheless, HA’s motivation and positive feedback are a good
basis for future trials of this individualized rehabilitation concept. Taken together,
each task was tested in experimental trials with healthy adults and neurological
patients. While the outcome of the validity assessments remains inconclusive for
90

most outcomes, the qualitative feedback from participants is of high importance and
lends support for further expansion and evaluation of individualized rehabilitation
in VEs. The second aim of this dissertation has been fulfilled.

4.1.3 Aim 3
It is aimed to develop an optimized workflow for creating individualized VEs.
During the course of this dissertation an effective workflow for the development of
VEs has been established. Several game engines and applications for 3D modeling
were tested for their compatibility and their ability to rapidly create realistic virtual
scenarios. The game engine Unity and Google SketchUp were chosen for their ease
of use and active user community. It has to be noted that this workflow is based on
the personal preferences and skills of the developer. These choices may change over
time with the release of software updates or new applications. Each software and
development choice as described in chapter 2 can be adjusted to match the
developer’s skillset and preferences. Further, it is acknowledged that these
procedures do not constitute innovative concepts and are for the most part common
knowledge for game and software developers. However, the proposed workflow is
intended to serve as a suggestion for researchers and developers of clinical
applications to minimize development time and costs. After the workflow was
presented at the International Conference on Virtual Rehabilitation 2010, Zurich,
Switzerland (Koenig, Dünser, et al., 2011), several research groups showed interest
in this development concept and have adopted the described procedures into their
projects (Sangani et al., 2012). Hence, aim 3 has been accomplished.

4.1.4 Aim 4
It is an aim of this thesis to integrate each cognitive task in a meaningful VE.
The game engine Unity provides the option to import Unity packages into a project.
Each cognitive task has been developed within Unity and exported into such
package. Whenever an individual VE is created for training a patient, the
appropriate task only needs to be imported into this scene and set up as described
in chapter 2.4. This modular approach ensures that only minimal time is spent on
the integration of VEs and cognitive tasks. The integration was demonstrated for
each experimental trial of this dissertation. Hence, this aim has been achieved.

4.1.5 Aim 5
It is an aim to test the efficiency of the development process of the VEs:
a. in a controlled setting.
In experiment three the development process was evaluated by randomly choosing
four rooms from the Asklepios Rehabilitation Clinic, Schaufling, Germany. Each
room was modeled to-scale in less than six hours by an experienced developer.
Development times can vary depending on the developer’s experience with tools and
workflows. For the purpose of this thesis the VEs were detailed and realistic
representations of the actual real-world scenarios. The sufficient quality of these
91

models was demonstrated by a survey in which clinic staff recognized the
environments in at least 88% of all cases.

b. in a clinical, patient-centered setting.
Experiment four involved the measurement, modeling and clinical usage of an
individualized VE. Patient HA’s kitchen was modeled to scale and used for the
training of spatial memory. During a home visit the kitchen was measured and
photos and videos of the environment were taken. The modeling process took a total
of about eight hours when using the described workflow with an experienced
developer. However, the development was spread out over the course of one week
due to clinical obligations of the developer. Additional time was invested once the
application was fully functional to add further details to the environment in order
to showcase the scene outside of the clinic. Considering the initial 8-hour
development effort, this aim is considered to be completed. In the future, the
workflow and development tools would ideally be adjusted to empower the clinician
to set up characteristics of the VE and make changes to tasks and collected data. As
of now an experienced developer is required to fulfill this role.

4.1.6 Aim 6
It is aimed to apply the embedded cognitive tasks throughout the neurological
rehabilitation of a brain-injured patient.
Patient HA suffered from a severe traumatic brain injury with substantial damage
to bilateral frontal lobes and left temporal lobe. The patient’s rehabilitation goal
was to return home and live independently without the need to receive help for
activities of daily living. Cooking a meal was identified as an important task that
requires planning, spatial memory and working memory. After the kitchen
environment was modeled in sufficient detail, kitchen utensils and groceries were
placed in the actual locations in which they also could be found in the real kitchen.
These items were defined as target objects and integrated into the VMT. HA used
the VMT as it was originally intended by moving targets to previously learned
locations either with or without perspective changes. Also, HA trained the order in
which targets were needed for meal preparation by picking the items up and
placing them next to each other in the correct order. More detailed information
about the use of the VMT can be found in chapter 3.4.4. VNT and pointing task
were not used during this single-case trial as patient HA’s orientation and
navigation ability were unimpaired. Due to the fact that the focus of HA’s
rehabilitation shifted towards physical and occupational therapy, the number of
training sessions using the individualized VMT is low. Further prolonged use of the
VMT with brain-injured patients is necessary to draw conclusions about the test’s
feasibility for clinical use. In addition, a randomized controlled trial is needed to
establish the VMT’s potential for improving cognitive abilities during neurological
rehabilitation. Aim six has only been partially accomplished.

92

4.1.7 Aim 7
It is an aim to use the VMT to accommodate a patient’s individual therapy goal.
The VMT has been used in a single case trial (Chapter 3.4) during which the
application has been adapted to the patient’s therapy goals. The main goal for
patient HA was to regain independence in functional tasks such as personal
hygiene, dressing, cooking and eating. While most goals were concerned with the
regaining of motor function, meal preparation was selected as a goal for cognitive
rehabilitation. Making a meal involves remembering where relevant items in the
kitchen are stored. They also have to be used in the correct order (e.g. bread is
needed before butter can be used). HA used the VMT to train to remember the
location and use of kitchen-related items in the environment. The individualized
task was set up to replicate the actual location of the target items which HA had to
remember. A total of three different ways to utilize the VMT to reach HA’s therapy
goals were found. Only two of the three tasks were actually used in therapy, as HA
started to remember how the kitchen was organized on her own. Results of this trial
show first support to indicate that the VMT is flexible enough to adapt to a patient’s
individual therapy goals. Similar flexibility can be expected from the navigation
task as navigation targets can be adapted to the patient’s needs. However, since
patient HA’s training did not include navigation or spatial orientation, no such
conclusion can be drawn without further clinical trials. Given the heterogeneity of
neurological deficits that are to be expected in cognitive rehabilitation these results
have to be replicated across a larger sample of patients before conclusions about
widespread use of this individualized rehabilitation approach are possible.

4.1.8 Aim 8
It is an aim to integrate the proposed workflow into the rehabilitation routine of a
brain-injured patient.
Patient HA suffered from a severe traumatic brain injury which caused extensive
damage to both frontal lobes and the left-sided temporal lobe. The initial therapy
goal for patient HA was to live independently at home without requiring assistance
in basic activities of daily living (e.g. eating, personal hygiene). During experiment
four the VMT was used to train HA’s ability to prepare a meal. Navigation and
orientation ability were not deficient so that VNT and pointing task were not
relevant for the patient’s rehabilitation. A home visit was scheduled after the study
protocol was discussed with the patient and parents and informed consent was
established. During this two-hour visit the real environment was measured and
photographed. Based on this information the virtual scenario was created over the
course of one week. The actual development time was approximately eight hours,
but due to clinical obligations of the experimenter the development process was
delayed. The detailed development process is described in chapter 3.4.2. Due to the
delayed development this aim was only partially accomplished. However, in actual
clinical use this limitation would be irrelevant as the developer creating the VE
would not be involved in clinical work. Future trials need to replicate this workflow
integration with a wider range of brain-injured patients.

93

4.2 Hypotheses
4.2.1 Hypothesis I
Cognitive tasks integrated into the VEs are expected to target specific cognitive
processes (process-specificity).
a. The VNT is hypothesized to show equivalent outcomes of navigation
measures as compared to a real-world navigation task.
The results of both evaluation studies (Chapter 3.1 and 3.2) do not allow for strong
conclusions about the validity of the proposed cognitive tasks. The navigation task’s
results show large variability for a sample of 31 healthy participants navigating
through a real-world complex building and its virtual counterpart. Several of the
study’s assessed variables are affected by difficulties of participants interacting
with the VE. An analysis based on Tryon’s approach of equivalence testing (2001)
between participants navigating through real and VEs does not reveal conclusive
evidence for both scenarios being equivalent. However, the absence of large effect
sizes and statistically significant differences between both groups suggest that the
navigation experience in real and VE are somewhat similar. Due to the absence of
conclusive, significant results, this hypothesis cannot be supported. However, these
initial results suggest that additional studies assessing navigation performance in
complex VEs are justified. No prior studies were found that evaluate equivalence of
navigation behavior in healthy and brain-injured participants. It can be expected
that cognitive performance, and thus also navigation performance, is markedly
impaired in brain-injured patients (Rao, Jackson, & Howard, 1999; Schretlen &
Shapiro, 2003). However, it is currently unknown how lesion locations (e.g. frontal
lobe damage affecting navigation strategies) and severity of injuries might
differently affect navigation performance in real and virtual environments and
whether equivalence of performance in real and virtual environments applies to this
population. However, many studies have been conducted about wayfinding
performance in brain-injured patients (e.g. Livingstone & Skelton, 2007; van
Asselen et al., 2006). A future study needs to reveal how memory deficits, planning
deficits or impairments in spatial processing and imagery affect performance in
VEs.

b. The VNT is predicted to significantly correlate with pencil and paper
measures of spatial abilities.
All VNT outcome measures were not significantly correlated with pencil and paper
tests of spatial abilities. Only errors in an additional task, the floor plan task, were
significantly correlated with the Card Rotation Test (CRT). Poor performance in the
CRT was associated with larger number of errors for drawing in targets and current
location on a floor plan of the Erskine building. The lack of convergent validity with
measures of spatial abilities suggests that navigation performance in complex
environments cannot be explained by traditional assessment methods. It is
expected that such difficult scenarios with many possible routes towards the target

94

location require the integration of multiple cognitive abilities such as working
memory, planning, focused attention, and problem solving. Since the assessed
environment was a public building (campus building) with many people and
distracting stimuli, the difficulty of the task was much higher than traditional
navigation tasks (Koh, et al., 1999; Witmer, et al., 1996). Further evaluations will
be required to reveal the relationship between navigation performance in complex
environments, difficulty parameters of the task/environment, and cognitive
abilities. This hypothesis has not been supported.

c. The VMT is hypothesized to significantly correlate with established
neuropsychological tests that assess spatial memory.
The VMT’s evaluation shows promising results for its future use in a clinical
context. Study outcomes suggest that the test’s scores are significantly correlated
with results of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test which is a test for
spatial/visual memory. Based on these results, the hypothesis is supported.

d. The VMT is hypothesized to significantly correlate with established
neuropsychological tests that assess spatial abilities.
No correlations have been found with neuropsychological tests of spatial abilities
(e.g. perspective taking and mental rotations) and working memory. Though, the
conceptualization of test results plays an important role in these interpretations.
Results of the VMT are much more complex than the correct-incorrect dichotomy of
traditional test items. Furthermore, the study’s clinical sample was very
heterogeneous in regards to brain injuries and cognitive abilities. Consequently, the
validity of the VMT has to be re-assessed with homogeneous samples of relevant
target populations as well as healthy participants of several age ranges.

e. It is predicted that the VMT does not show significant correlations with
cognitive tests of domains unrelated to the VMT.
The VMT did not correlate significantly with the D2 test of attention. This result is
an indicator for the VMT’s divergent validity. However, since the test also did not
correlate with measures of spatial abilities, the absence of correlations with
standard pencil and paper tests might only be due to the complex nature of the
VMT. Further evaluation is required to confirm whether the results of the proposed
tasks are unrelated to the outcomes of traditional neuropsychological assessments.
Moreover, future studies need to assess whether the proposed tests provide
information that is more relevant for the everyday performance of brain-injured
individuals.

f. The pointing task is hypothesized to show equivalent results in a real
environment and its virtual counterpart.
Despite the similarity of navigation parameters in both groups of experiment one, a
consistent difference in distance judgment emerged across all studies. During the
navigation trial and the mental maps task (Chapter 3.3.3) participants consistently
underestimated distances within VEs. These results are in agreement with existing

95

studies (Witmer & Kline, 1998) and have to be taken into account when distances
are of interest for cognitive assessment and training.
The conclusions from the previous hypotheses suggest that the validity of
the modular cognitive tasks requires further evaluation. Throughout this
dissertation many insights regarding task conceptualization, study design and data
capture have been gained. Consequently, the presented preliminary results are an
excellent starting point to further develop the set of cognitive tasks in future
studies. Conclusions based on current results need to be drawn carefully while
taking into account the applications’ prototypical nature, diverse sample and the
resulting data’s variability. Based on the results of the completed evaluation
studies, Hypothesis-I cannot be accepted. Most comparisons to traditional
neuropsychological assessments do not support the validity of the proposed tasks.
Though, as previously indicated, there are large conceptual differences between the
proposed complex tasks and pencil and paper tests.

4.2.2 Hypothesis II
The proposed applications are predicted to be flexible enough to meet the changing
demands of a patient’s neurological rehabilitation (context-sensitivity).
a. The VMT is expected to be used throughout a patient’s neurological
rehabilitation without the occurrence of a floor or ceiling effect.
During a single case study (Chapter 3.4) the VMT has been used to train patient HA
for a total of nine sessions over the course of four weeks. For the purpose of this
study 30 different arrangements of target items were created. Nine of these setups
used the individualized kitchen environment of patient HA, all others were based
on the standard version of the VMT. The arrangements covered tasks with four to
seven target items and 0, 90, and 180 degree viewpoint shifts. This setup provided a
wide range of task difficulties and was expected to be sufficient for training sessions
throughout a patient’s neurologic rehabilitation. Over the course of patient HA’s
training sessions no clear performance pattern emerged. Task performance varied
considerably across trials but HA always appeared to be challenged appropriately.
In easier trials HA smiled while reporting a sense of accomplishment. Harder trials
(i.e. six to seven targets, 180 degree perspective change) left the patient motivated
to try again without being discouraging. After the second week of cognitive training
patient HA’s main focus shifted towards the regaining of motor abilities, so that
only a low frequency of VMT trials was accomplished.
Considering the absence of any floor or ceiling effects, task difficulty has
been found to be adequate throughout the four-week training period. However,
prolonged task exposure in future clinical trials in which patients partake in highfrequency training will be necessary to substantiate evidence for accepting this
hypothesis in a wider population of cognitively impaired individuals. Within the
scope set forth in this dissertation, Hypothesis II-a has been supported. The VMT is
flexible enough to relate to the dynamic nature of a patient’s neurologic
rehabilitation without the occurrence of floor or ceiling effects.

96

4.2.3 Hypothesis III
The workflow for creating the proposed individualized training is expected to be
suitable to create realistic, high-fidelity environments with a high degree of
ecological relevance.
a. It is hypothesized that developed VEs show high recognition rates by users.
Experiment three evaluated the quality and realism of four VEs that were modeled
after four randomly selected rooms at the Asklepios Rehabilitation Clinic,
Schaufling, Germany. Staff members were asked to identify screenshots of the VEs
and also to recognize the locations of the VEs out of a set of 20 photographs of rooms
throughout the clinic. While identification rates ranged between 56% and 98%, the
recognition rates were above 88% for all four rooms. These results suggest that
most participants are able to recognize the VEs and associate them with the
respective real-world environments. Consequently, VEs created by the proposed
workflow are of sufficient fidelity and visual quality to represent real-world
locations. Hypothesis III-a has been confirmed. Future studies can potentially
address the effect of visual quality and visual details on the outcome of cognitive
tasks and recognition rates. However, the difference in development efforts between
highly detailed and low-detailed environments is expected to be minimal. Hence, a
highly detailed environment of high visual quality appears to be the preferred
choice.

b. Cognitive tasks are expected to be transparent and easy to understand by
users.
During experiment two the VMT was shown to be effective for patients who were
denying their cognitive deficits. A total of five patients were able to gain an
understanding of their deficits due to the transparent, easy-to-understand nature of
the VMT. When debriefing the patients, they reported that they were able to relate
to the task and understand its relevance for their daily life. Feedback from users in
all other experiments was mostly positive. Only during the first experiment three
participants had to withdraw from the study due to symptoms of simulator
sickness. The VNT was the first prototypical development effort during this
dissertation. Issues with display distortion on large projection screens and the
mouse-based user interaction caused problems for some participants. However, no
evaluation surveys were used to assess the usability of the developed applications.
All feedback was gathered verbally after each training or testing session. Based on
the quantitative feedback from the conducted experiments, Hypothesis III-b can be
partially accepted. An additional trial will be necessary to further explore the
ecological validity and usability of the proposed application and to substantiate this
hypothesis.

97

4.2.4 Hypothesis IV
The workflow for creating the proposed individualized training is expected to be
effective enough for integration into the daily routine of a rehabilitation clinic.
a. Each functional training environment should be created in less than one
working day (i.e. eight hours of development).
The evaluation of the proposed workflow included the modeling of four random
rooms of a large-scale hospital building (Chapter 3.3.1). Each room was measured,
photographed and modeled with Google SketchUp by an expert developer within
less than six hours. During an actual clinical trial the development process also
involves travel to the patient’s home environment or workplace. As a consequence, a
functional training environment can often be ready for use within one or two
working days, depending on the availability and communication with the patient’s
family or work superiors. Also, high familiarity and experience of the developer
with an effective workflow and specific tools is required. A wide range of tools and
procedures is available to achieve the desired outcome. However, the exact
development time of a functional VE might vary depending on the developer’s skill
and used tools. Within the scope of this thesis the development process was shown
to be adequate for use in the context of a rehabilitation clinic. As long as a single
room is sufficient for a patient’s cognitive training and expertise with the proposed
workflow or a similar workflow can be assumed, Hypothesis IV-a can be accepted. If
more rooms or highly-detailed environments are of importance for a patient to
regain independence in daily activities, the workflow for creating VEs has to be
further optimized.

98

4.3 Limitations and future work
The prototypical state of the proposed application places several restrictions on the
interpretation of the collected data and the usage of the rehabilitation system.
However, each of these restrictions opens up opportunities for future development
and expansion of the current system. The following chapter discusses limitations of
the proposed rehabilitation framework and how they can be addressed in the
future. Further, possible extensions of the current system are portrayed.

4.3.1 Workflow
As previously demonstrated the proposed interactive VEs can be created within six
hours as long as the real scenario is limited to a single room (Chapter 3.3.1).
However, the current workflow is still labor-intensive and poses several restrictions
on the everyday use of the proposed system in a clinical context. A single virtual
room is not always going to be sufficient for cognitive training, especially when
navigation and spatial orientation are of interest. Therefore, the development time
will be a multiple of the estimated six hours, depending on the number and size of
relevant rooms. A further bottleneck for system development is the acquisition of
measurements, photographs, and video footage of the real environment. The
developer has to arrange for a meeting with the patient’s family or employer, travel
to the real environment, and spend at least two to three hours collecting
information about the relevant scenario. This workflow integrates families or
employers directly into the rehabilitation process which can be considered an
advantage over traditional therapy protocols. However, the information collection
essentially poses an intrusion into the family’s privacy or the employer’s daily work
routine. Consequently, alternatives to the current workflow should be evaluated
that automate this process or minimize the time spent at the relevant real
environment. One option is to actively involve families and employers in this
information acquisition. Unfortunately, without any knowledge of the 3D modeling
process it is challenging to take adequate photographs and videos of the
environment. Hence, the family or employer would need substantial guidance to
collect measurements and photos themselves. From the 3D modeling experience
gained during this dissertation it turned out to be much more difficult to model a
virtual space without ever having seen the real space. While a video walkthrough of
the actual environment is helpful for creating the virtual model, the developer’s
experience of personally walking through the real environment can help
tremendously when creating realistic virtual scenes.
The use of laser scanners34 or depth-cameras (Izadi et al., 2011) needs to be
considered as an additional option for creating 3D models of real environments.
However, laser scanners are often expensive and commonly produce data for
computer-aided design (CAD) applications. Geometry in CAD-formats (e.g. .DWG or

34

Faro GmbH – http://www.faro.com

99

.DXF formats) is very complex and not optimized for real-time 3D applications.
Hence, the CAD-models would need to be exported to a 3D modeling application and
simplified significantly to make them a viable option for real-time rendering. This
complex procedure would offset the initial time savings and result in a much more
costly workflow.
A cost-effective alternative for real-time scanning of complex geometry has
been demonstrated using a Microsoft Kinect (Izadi, et al., 2011). This concept not
only provides an option for the rapid production of realistic 3D models and VEs, it
could essentially change the way we interact with real and virtual spaces. If the
Microsoft Kinect can capture the environment dynamically in real-time, cognitive
tasks could eventually be integrated directly with the information that the depthsensing camera provides on-the-fly. The user would then interact with the real item
via see-through optics instead of a virtual representation of items and environments
on a computer screen. Alternatively, the captured 3D geometry could be exported
and used in a traditional setup at the hospital as it has been described in previous
chapters. Given the rapid development of creative projects using the Microsoft
Kinect35, these scenarios will probably be feasible in the not-so-distant future.

4.3.2 User interaction
User interaction was considered an integral part of system development. Prior to
using the VMT, navigation task, and pointing task in experimental trials, several
user interfaces were tested. Using a simple three-button-mouse emerged as the best
option for virtual navigation, even though some users still struggled to effectively
move through the virtual scenarios. For the VMT and pointing tasks a shared
interface between therapist and patient was employed. Keyboard and mouse were
redundantly mapped with all commands required to use the applications. The
patient was able to make selections and move items with the mouse while the
therapist had the option to support the patient via keyboard whenever necessary.
Some patients struggled to understand the concept of pointing towards unseen
targets using the computer mouse and a red target pointer on the computer screen.
In such cases additional instructions were necessary. However, almost all
participants were able to use the mouse-based interface with only little assistance.
However, patients with hemiplegia, tremor or other motor disabilities were very
inaccurate with mouse movements, especially when attempting to drag and drop
small target items. Further evaluations of alternate interfaces will have to be
conducted in the future to avoid introducing this source of error into the outcome of
the cognitive tasks. For example, the use of a modified controller for discrete button
presses (e.g. game pad), body-/hand-tracking through Microsoft Kinect or webcameras, or brain-computer interfaces such as the Emotiv Epoc36 might be viable
alternatives to the currently used interface. Ease of use for older patients without
computer experience and patients with motor disabilities need to be considered.
Most importantly, the users’ experiences need to be quantified in order to make

100

well-informed decisions about which interfaces to use in future iterations of the
proposed rehabilitation framework.
Displaying the VEs was a major concern for the evaluation of the navigation
task (Chapter 3.1). The experimental protocol involved a three-screen back projection
system with a field-of-view of 120 degrees. Distortion of the user’s viewpoint
through the virtual camera and problems with using the computer mouse for
navigation caused three users to report symptoms of simulator sickness and several
other participants to show mild symptoms of simulator sickness. However, the
unique display setup of this experimental protocol was of no relevance for the
everyday use of the proposed rehabilitation system. The cognitive tasks are
intended for use on a high-performance Windows-based PC with a single monitor.
None of the neurological patients tested in Experiments 2-4 (Chapters 3.2, 3.3, 3.4)
reported any major signs of simulator sickness when using such desktop setup.
However, when developing applications for brain-injured individuals, additional
care regarding the exposure to interactive VEs and provocative visual stimuli is
required. Even though the desktop setup is of low immersiveness compared to headmounted displays or large projection screens, patients with traumatic brain injuries
or epilepsy require special consideration during development and usage of such
system. Stanney’s (2002, pp. 721-730) recommended protocol still represents the
most recent standard for exposing participants to VEs and should be used when
designing future experiments. It contains a list of guidelines for the development
and exposure of users to a VE system. A more intuitive and restricted input scheme
can also contribute to the safety and comfort of the users (Stanney, et al., 2002).
In summary, the proposed framework has been tested with a wide variety of
healthy and brain-injured patients. The feedback gained during these trials has
been invaluable and improved each of the cognitive tests during their respective
experimental trials. During each study a wide range of users with different levels of
abilities were chosen. This was a limiting factor to the validity evaluation of the
developed tests. On the contrary, the verbal feedback from patients suggests that
the proposed system is applicable and usable with a heterogeneous patient
population. While no systematic user feedback was collected, patients commented
on user interface, task mechanics, motivation and task transparency. This
anecdotal feedback suggests that the developed tools are suitable for future validity
evaluations and randomized controlled clinical trials.

4.3.3 Evaluation design and analysis
Two conceptual issues were of critical importance across all conducted evaluation
studies. Firstly, a primary goal of all evaluations was to show that cognitive
processes are similar when the user is exposed to VEs as opposed to experiencing
the real world. This by itself poses a problem, because most statistical analyses
done in the past decades are concerned about null hypothesis significance testing in
which the experimenters are looking to find significant differences between groups
or testing conditions. However, the absence of a significant difference does not
provide evidence for the null hypothesis (i.e. no difference between the means of the
tested samples/conditions) to be true (Nickerson, 2000). Tryon (2001) and Tryon and
Lewis (2008) propose a procedure to statistically test for equivalence between two
101

groups. However, their analysis is based on the overlapping range of inferential
(shortened) confidence intervals. This range is compared to an interval (delta) that
is considered to be of no consequence regarding the difference of both groups.
Unfortunately, no guidelines exist that indicate what information delta needs to be
based on. According to the author (personal communication with W. Tryon, January
29, 2010) the range of delta needs to be determined on substantive grounds and
should be based on its practical consequences, a reasoned argument, and clinical
experience. This however leaves much room for subjectivity and results in case-bycase decisions. In Experiment 1 (Chapter 3.1), for which an equivalence analysis has
been conducted, one wrong turn or incorrect decisions can already result in a
patient getting lost and not finding a target. Should therefore delta be set to an
error score of zero? What is the relevance of a wrong navigation decision? These
questions essentially lead to the second fundamental issue concerning the
conducted experiments.
The data output of the developed applications exceeds the complexity of most
traditional neuropsychological tests. The navigation task records the exact path of
the user so that each individual decision and the complete route are stored and
available for analysis. With such data complexity questions arise about how this
information can be used for clinical decision-making. Does it matter whether the
patient arrives at the target on a suboptimal route or after walking in circles? It is
critical to ask how such differentiated information can add to the current practice of
using established questionnaires and neuropsychological tests. Eventually, the
information provided by the proposed cognitive tasks needs to be used by clinicians
for whom the output of a lengthy log file of spatial coordinates and time stamps is of
little use. Recording of navigation paths for visual analysis has already been
established as a valuable tool (Werner, Rabinowitz, Klinger, Korczyn, & Josman,
2009). However, there are still no established standards of how such information
can be useful in a clinical context. Eventually, a compromise has to be found
between simplifying the available information for everyday use as a clinical tool and
taking the most advantage of collected data by condensing data sets as little as
possible.
However, it is not only the amount of data that is of relevance. The
conceptualization of how useful measures can be derived from the collected data is
of equal importance. Navigation data can be analyzed in many different ways.
Arguably the most sophisticated solution is the use of pathfinding algorithms that
are commonly applied in computer science, more specifically in video games. With
such algorithms the environment is decomposed into a graph consisting of
interconnected nodes. Each connection is assigned an edge path cost. Travelling
along the nodes is represented by the summation of all edge path costs along the
taken route. This allows the calculation of shortest routes and the cost of each path,
potentially introducing a measurement of error which could be used to quantify
navigation performance. However, the navigation task can potentially produce a
large number of data points per second. Integrating this data set into a navigation
graph (so-called navigation mesh) is not a straight forward task, especially for
complex large-scale environments that involve several height levels (i.e. floors). The
pathfinding setup and calculations would need to be adapted for the existing

102

workflow. Before such expansion of the current system can be considered, the utility
of the resulting data needs to be evaluated.
The data output of the VMT requires similar evaluation. Distance measures
in three-dimensional space provide much more information than the conventional
correct-incorrect dichotomy of many traditional neuropsychological test items.
Consequently, a survey among potential clinical users could unveil useful solutions
to display and process the system’s collected data.
Additional concerns about the design and methodology of the conducted
evaluations require further discussion. The combination of context-sensitive and
process-specific aspects within the same application raises an interesting question.
How does the individualized content of each task interfere with the task’s
standardization and comparison to normative data? Theoretically, the use of
different target items and different context in memory assessments should have a
profound influence on the task’s outcome. Task context and target items are
expected to be familiar and have relevance or emotional valence to the patient.
Even though distances, angles, and task mechanics can be held constant across
users, the task content will be different for each individualized application. Given
that familiarity of the modeled environment and targets vary across patients and
that extend of knowledge about the learning context influences memory
performance (Smith, 1979), a standardization of the proposed tasks seems
problematic.
In fact, it is unclear whether a standardization and collection of normative
data is even necessary. As long as the individualized cognitive tasks possess
predictive value and can provide information about the user’s everyday performance
to aid clinical decision-making, this controversy could be solved. However, such
evaluation of predictive validity needs to be addressed in future studies. The
outcome measures of the cognitive tasks need to be correlated with real-world
functional tasks at different time intervals after the patient has been discharged
from rehabilitation. Ylvisaker’s (2003) approach to evaluating context-sensitive
rehabilitation in a randomized controlled trial also addresses the described
dilemma. A general evaluation of treatment efficacy can be achieved by using
context as independent variable and comparing patients treated with nonindividualized treatments against a group which receives context-sensitive
treatment. Variation in such contextualized treatment as described by Ylvisaker
would not be due to different tools and people involved in the delivery of the
treatment (i.e. family members, teachers, coaches), but rather due to different VEs
and target objects based on the same rehabilitation framework. The inclusion of
functional performance after rehabilitation has finished would again serve as a
main outcome measure and basis for assessing predictive validity.
The concept of context-dependent memory has been experimentally
demonstrated in several studies (Anderson, 2000, pp. 279-280). Based on this body
of evidence, the question arises whether this context effect can also be replicated
with a combination of real and virtual context scenarios (e.g. acquisition in real
environment, recall in virtual equivalent). This notion could lend strong support to
assessments with high ecological validity, so that high-fidelity applications provide
103

more accurate evidence for the patients’ true abilities in environments that are
relevant for everyday life. When taking these concerns into account, the comparison
to traditional neuropsychological tests appears to be of lower priority, as the task’s
relationship to activities of daily living emerges as the more dominant concept. This
situation could almost be seen as ironical, being the opposite of traditional validity
concepts. As Shadish, Cook, and Campbell (2001) mention, ecological validity is the
only characteristic that does not need to be present in order for an experiment to be
considered valid. Internal and external validity on the other hand, are a
requirement for the overall validity of an experiment (Shadish, et al., 2001). While
it can be argued that test development as described in this dissertation and Shadish
and colleagues’ domain of experimental design conceptually differ, the controversy
of the role of VR applications within the scope of validity evaluations remains. As
previously noted, shifting focus from internal validity to comparisons of main
outcome measures to functional tasks in a natural setting could shed light on the
application’s predictive validity. This is not to say that future evaluations of the
proposed system should abandon the aim to reveal associations with wellestablished measures of cognition. It even has to be noted that the conducted
experiments of this dissertation face several methodological limitations as outlined
in this chapter. Due to these limitations it is unclear whether the absence of
correlations of the proposed cognitive tasks with existing neuropsychological
assessments are a result of the used methodology or are in fact the true outcome.
Further evaluations are needed to address these limitations.
The fact that all evaluation studies have been conducted by one
experimenter has to be noted as an additional limiting factor. Due to financial
restraints study designs, assignment to experimental conditions as well as
assessments/treatments have been carried out by the same person. Besides the
experimenter being aware of the participants’ assignment to conditions,
participants were also aware of all experimental manipulations. As a consequence,
non-blinded participants and experimenter can lead to biased results that need to
be interpreted carefully. For all clinical trials (Chapter 3.2, 3.3, 3.4) the experimenter
was also part of the therapeutic team for most of the participating patients. Even
though the initial patient interview, information sheets and consent forms clearly
indicated the strict separation of therapy and research participation, some patients
might have not performed to their full abilities, depending on the cause of their
deficits and their perspective beyond rehabilitation. For upcoming studies, data
collection should be conducted by an experimenter who is unaware of the
assignment of patients to different experimental conditions. A double-blind
procedure seems not feasible as the experimental protocols and manipulations
mostly are easy to distinguish for the participant and need to be explained in detail
before establishing informed written consent.
A further limitation of the conducted trials is the deliberate choice of
participants from a broad range of backgrounds. Healthy participants within a wide
range of age, computer skills, and education were chosen for the navigation task
evaluation (Chapter 3.1). Participants from the Christchurch community were
haphazardly approached in public places throughout the city. The healthy
participants were chosen due to limited availability of brain-injured patients and
the prototypical nature of the VNT. Consequently, results of experiment one cannot
104

be generalized towards clinical populations until further evaluation trials have been
conducted. It can be assumed that a clinical population’s performance on the VNT
will be inferior to the outcomes of the current VNT trial. Though, without an
additional trial this first experiment can merely serve as a comparison and
guideline for future trials.
Clinical participants for Experiments 2-4 (Chapters 3.2, 3.3, 3.4) were
recruited regardless of size and location of their brain injury. The tested clinical
sample was comprised of patients across a wide range of age, computer experience,
education, and cognitive abilities. These liberal recruitment strategies were
employed to expose the developed applications to a heterogeneous set of users for
comprehensive collection of user feedback. The proposed rehabilitation framework
is designed to be applicable to a wide range of brain injuries that cause deficits of
memory or spatial abilities. Also, the recruitment criteria present a balance
between available resources (i.e. time, patients, funding, participating hospitals and
clinicians) and the ability to draw meaningful conclusions from the trial. A welldefined homogeneous patient group requires a large pool of patients to choose from,
preferably from several large hospitals over an extended period of time. If time or
patient availability is restricted, the inclusion criteria can be broadened in order to
collect sufficient data points for meaningful comparisons. Alternatively, few
patients with similar lesion characteristics can be recruited for multiple testing
sessions and extended exposure. However, neurological rehabilitation can be
unpredictable with patients being transferred between hospitals, health care plans
not paying for extended rehabilitation, seizures and headaches preventing test
sessions and patients often lacking motivation or willingness to give informed
consent. Hence, less restrictive inclusion criteria were chosen to avoid the risk of
only recruiting very few patients or no patients at all in the limited timeframe of
the clinical trials in Schaufling, Germany. The chosen recruiting strategy allowed
for user feedback from a wide range of patients. However, the heterogeneous group
of patients must be seen as a limitation in the context of the conducted validity
analysis. The obtained effect sizes were small, in part due to the large variability of
the data sets. With such low statistical power the employed analyses might have
not been able to detect significant differences between the experimental conditions.
Therefore, future trials need to consider the recruitment of homogeneous samples
with well-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. For clinical samples the
recruitment of patients with distinct brain lesions (e.g. damage to the right
posterior parietal cortex) seems to be a promising approach for reducing variability
of collected data. The existing exploratory studies of this dissertation can then be
used for conservative effect size estimation (i.e. assuming that following studies
show less variability) to calculate sample sizes for adequate statistical power in
upcoming clinical trials.
For future single-case trials the experimental protocol has to be extended to
include enough training sessions to warrant a statistical time-series analysis (e.g.
trend estimation). The data set for each session would optimally consist of
information collected within the VE and additional well-established measures of
cognitive abilities. Testing activities of daily living for each session can be a useful
alternative. However, the availability of validated alternate versions of
neuropsychological tests may become an issue for such protocol. The learning effects
105

of repeated testing need to be taken into account, regardless of whether functional
activities or pen and paper tests are used. Further, the capacity and daily
fluctuations of the patients’ attentional resources are limiting factors for extended
testing/training sessions. Depending on the patient’s therapy schedule and specific
brain lesion, 30 to 60 minutes of cognitive tests and trainings were acceptable in
most of the conducted sessions. With such limited time, tests and training tasks
need to be chosen and balanced carefully to avoid introducing biased results due to
the patient’s exhaustion.
During the evaluation of the VMT it became apparent that the alternation of
target items between trials caused interference for several participants. The
occurrence and location of items in previous trials was reported to be interfering
with the current task. The number of relevant target items depends on the task
that the patient is expected to train. For example, preparing a breakfast involves a
limited number of items so that for a comprehensive training some targets will have
to be repeated over time. A future study needs to assess the influence of target pool
size, target repetitions, familiarity with targets, and the interaction of those factors
with the user’s mnemonic strategies on task outcome.
Lastly, the motivation of users is expected to be high due to the realism and
relevance of the VE and cognitive tasks. It can be argued that the use of game
elements as part of the framework could potentially enhance the long-term
motivation of users to continuously practice cognitive skills. Features like character
progression, story-driven events, game scores and other game mechanics can
provide means for users to train cognitive skills while having fun at the same time.
However, the inclusion of game mechanics can require the implementation of
abstract concepts which in turn have to be shown to transfer to the related realworld concepts. For example, Dunwell, Christmas and de Freitas (2011) describe
the serious game “Code of Everand” in which children have to watch for incoming
monsters from left and right before crossing “spirit channels”. This serves as a
metaphor for street crossing behavior in real-world scenarios. However, during the
design and evaluation of the application it has to be taken into account that the
user has to make the connection between metaphor and actual target behavior.
Such requirement of abstraction was purposely avoided during this thesis by using
realistic scenarios and cognitive tasks. Transfer of trained behavior to real-world
situations has not received much support in clinical trials to date (Ylvisaker, 2003)
and thus, the individualized simulation approach has been chosen over the
development of a serious game.

4.3.4 Expansion of current framework
The proposed set of cognitive tasks is currently in a prototypical state and consists
of individual VEs and a set of cognitive tasks. A fully functional VE can be
developed in a matter of one to two days using the described workflow. However, indepth knowledge of the 3D modeling process and the integration process within
Unity are necessary to publish an application for a clinician to use. While the VMT
has been developed by using extensive feedback from patients and clinicians, the
navigation task was the first prototype developed for this dissertation. Its
implementation and setup are not yet as user-friendly and require further
106

development effort in order to be used effectively. Navigation targets and
instructions need to be setup intuitively to compliment the rest of the proposed
workflow. Specifically, Unity’s interface needs to be extended through editor
scripting in order to provide a user-friendly interface for setting up the navigation
task’s parameters and targets.
In the future, a comprehensive framework that extends across several
cognitive domains is planned. Further cognitive tasks have to be developed and
evaluated to give patients the opportunity to train a wide variety of cognitive
abilities in relevant VEs depending on their individual needs. The context-sensitive
approach that has been introduced in this dissertation will eventually be combined
with domain-specific training tasks for prospective memory, problem-solving,
cognitive flexibility, visual attention and several other sub-types of attentional
processes (Zomeren & Brouwer, 1994). With the emergence of more effective tools
for capturing and modeling 3D environments, the remaining barriers for the
widespread use of individualized rehabilitation tools will be addressed. In the
meantime, next steps towards making this rehabilitation approach a reality include
further validation studies and a randomized clinical trial. The advantages of
individualized VR rehabilitation over traditional rehabilitation and the use of
generic VR scenarios need to be demonstrated repeatedly before widespread clinical
use becomes a possibility. While the benefit of this individualized framework above
and beyond current practices has not been demonstrated yet, the value of VR-based
individualized cognitive task for predicting everyday task performance in the
unique context of a patient’s everyday life needs to be considered. Depending on the
complexity of this context and the demands placed on the patient, individualized
VR-tasks may provide valuable information to the clinician. In some cases a
standardized pen and paper assessment might be sufficient; in other cases a handson functional task might provide more information. As long as the use of this
individualized approach provides additional valuable information for the
rehabilitative process of some patients, it is worth considering this framework as an
additional tool amongst other assessment and training choices. It is for upcoming
experimental trials to find out in which situations patients can profit the most from
this approach.
An important outcome of this thesis work is the anecdotal finding that five
patients gained insights in their cognitive deficits while using the VMT (chapter
3.2). This can potentially be an important factor for using realistic VEs for cognitive
rehabilitation. However, deficit denial was not assessed as part of the experimental
trials and was only discovered incidentally during patient debriefing and the
reaction of the patients during the test session. Future clinical trials need to
specifically address this outcome and systematically evaluate the effect of high
ecological validity on deficit awareness. This is important for ethical implications of
patients coming to terms with the drastic impact that brain-injuries can have on
their daily life. Also, deficit awareness appears to be critically important for the
success of cognitive rehabilitation (Ownsworth & Clare, 2006). Consequently, this
factor should be considered to be one of the main goals for future trials and can be
seen as a potential key factor in using VR technology for rehabilitation.

107

Lastly, it needs to be stated that the intention of this dissertation was solely to
develop and evaluate a prototypical set of cognitive tasks embedded in individual
VEs. This initial development effort is believed to be a step towards promoting and
fostering further research at the intersection of context-sensitive cognitive
rehabilitation and VR. The resulting motivation, deficit awareness and feedback of
users are important outcomes to build upon in future trials. During the course of
this work aspects of cost-effectiveness have repeatedly been pointed out by fellow
researchers as a critical factor for this rehabilitation approach. Questions of
development costs, distribution of the environments, and profitability arose.
However, considering the speed at which technologies evolve in the 21st century,
many of the technical limitations of the presented framework will be obsolete in the
near future. Instead of worrying about the framework’s integration in current
health care budgets, the theoretical foundations and the long-term benefits of
individualized VR rehabilitation have to be shown first.
