Electroencephalography-(EEG-) based control is a noninvasive technique which employs brain signals to control electrical devices/
circuits. Currently, the brain-computer interface (BCI) systems provide two types of signals, raw signals and logic state signals. The latter
signals are used to turn on/oﬀ the devices. In this paper, the capabilities of BCI systems are explored, and a survey is conducted how to
extend and enhance the reliability and accuracy of the BCI systems. A structured overview was provided which consists of the data
acquisition, feature extraction, and classiﬁcation algorithm methods used by diﬀerent researchers in the past few years. Some classiﬁcation algorithms for EEG-based BCI systems are adaptive classiﬁers, tensor classiﬁers, transfer learning approach, and deep learning,
as well as some miscellaneous techniques. Based on our assessment, we generally concluded that, through adaptive classiﬁers, accurate
results are acquired as compared to the static classiﬁcation techniques. Deep learning techniques were developed to achieve the desired
objectives and their real-time implementation as compared to other algorithms.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background. Brain-computer interface (or BCI) is basically setting up a connection between the human brain and
the computer device to control or to perform certain activity
using brain signals. These brain signals are translated as an
action for a device. The interface thus provides a one-to-one
communication pathway between the brain and the target.
The technology has advanced from mechanical devices and
touch systems, and now, world is approaching towards use of
neural waves as the input. Even though it is not widely applied
for now, it has a promising future. Especially for the physically
impaired people who face diﬃculties in performing physical
activities and lose their brain signal to move their muscles, it is
the only way to function.
A BCI system includes a device with electrodes that act as
sensors and measure brain signals, an ampliﬁer to raise the
weak neural signals, and a computer which decodes the
signals into controlling signals to operate devices. Mostly,
the BCI device is a headset which is portable and wearable.
The BCI device has two functions. Firstly, it records the
data reviewed at its electrodes, and secondly, it interprets or
decodes neural signals.

Nervous system resembles an electrical system which
passes nerve impulses as a message. This means neurons
(brain cells) communicate by transmitting and receiving
very small electrical waves, merely in range of microvolts.
Now, to sense and record these signals, we require precise
and advanced sensors.
Electrodes are set directly on the scalp or embedded in
the brain which requires surgical procedure. The nonsurgical method of electrode placement though does not
damage the brain, it yields poor-quality brain signals.
Those that are recorded directly from the scalp yield better
results but at the risk of surgery that may induce damage
in the brain. The risk of damaging brain tissues exceeds
the quality obtained through the surgical method. BCI is
therefore a better pathway for neurorehabilitation for
paralyzed people. Apart from these, other techniques
include functional MRI (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). fMRI maps brain activity with
an MRI scanner, while MEG is a brain imaging process that
identiﬁes brain activity. Electric currents ﬂowing through the
brain produce magnetic ﬁeld, and these are sensed by highly
sensitive magnetometers. Both fMRI and MEG techniques use
large and expensive machines. Another noninvasive

2
methodology is near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). In this
process, neural signals are recorded by passing NI light through
the head. The quality of the brain activity measurement is not
adequate for the brain computer interface.
In case of healthy people, the brain transmits signals
from the central nervous system to the muscles, and thus,
they can move the muscles of the body. However, in case of
people suﬀering from stroke or neuromuscular illness, the
transmission of signals between the brain and the rest of
body muscles is distorted. The patient’s body becomes
paralyzed or losses the capability to control muscle
movement, like cerebral palsy. It is observed that a patient
may not be able to move a muscle, but a brain can transmit
the neural signal. This means that the neural signal is
transmitted from the CNS but not received by target
muscles. A BCI can be designed to utilize those commands
to control devices or computer programs.
Each part of the body is controlled by a particular part of
the brain as shown in the ﬁgure. Using BCI techniques, it is
observed which part of the brain is active and transmitting
the signal. Through this, the BCI system can predict the
muscle locomotion from the brain activity [1].
BCI systems can be advanced, and multiple new
applications can be developed using a fact that a variety
of other brain activities can also be recognized. For
instance, while one performs a numeric calculation, the
frontal lobe is activated, and when one comprehends a
language, Wernicke’s area is activated.
Currently, numerous groups are contributing to the
evolution of BCIs so as to develop numerous applications,
speciﬁc for each category of the consumer. Each day, scientists and engineers are improving algorithms, BCI sensor
devices, and techniques for quality attainment of data and
improved accuracy of systems.
The problem is which method is optimal to analyze these
complex time-varying neural responses and map them accordingly to the output response desired. These signals are
merely in the range of microvolts. So, these electrical signals
are passed through several processes to remove noise and to
gather useful signals. Next, algorithms and classiﬁcation
techniques are applied to the data obtained [2].
1.2. Preliminaries. To attain a better understanding of BCI
systems and the processes that undergo within them, an
explanation of the terminologies and the said processes is
presented as follows.
1.2.1. Brain Waves. Brain waves are oscillating voltages
bearing amplitudes from microvolts to some millivolts; there
are 5 widely known brain waves bearing diﬀerent frequency
ranges exhibiting states of the brain as shown in Table 1 [3].
1.2.2. Brain Activity Recording Methods for the BCI. The
neural activity of the brain can be analyzed and understood
based on the recording methods used. Recording methods of
the BCI can be categorized as follows:

(1) Invasive Recording Techniques. Invasive recording
methods are those in which the electrodes are inserted deep
in the brain using surgical methods, and the quality of the
signal generated is better as compared to its noninvasive
counterpart; however, issues arise from long-term stability,
and protection is required to hinder them from creating
infections. One such example is electrocorticography
(ECoG), which measures the brain activity from the neural
cortex.
(2) Noninvasive Recording Techniques. Noninvasive techniques do not require any surgical treatment and thus safe
from causing any sort of infections; though their signal quality
is low, it is still a popular means of brain signal acquisition.
These techniques include electroencephalography (EEG)
in which the electrical activity is recorded from the scalp of
the brain and magnetoencephalography (MEG) in which
magnetic properties exhibited due to the diﬀerence in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin are recorded.
For our project, we will opt for an EEG-based signal
recording technique and explain its characteristics in the
following [1].
1.3. Electroencephalography (EEG). Introduced by Hans
Berger in 1929, EEG is a measurement of voltage levels that
underlines the activity of the brain in response to an event or
a stimulus. EEG method comprises electrodes placed on the
scalp of the brain at diﬀerent locations as speciﬁed in Figure 1 with temporary glue. The electric signals are generated
due to the ionic content present in the brain consisting of
Na+, Ca++, K+, and Cl− ions; the transportation of these
ions invokes the electric potential used in EEG.
The EEG signals are of low quality because of diﬀerent
layers of tissues between the EEG cap and the signal source
as shown in Figure 2. The potential created is in a range of
tens of microvolts, and these electrodes need to have
powerful ampliﬁers in order to acquire meaningful signals.
1.4. Need of BCI. Brain-computer interface-based technology is a developing ﬁeld, and it has been under focus by
many industries to innovate and make everyday life tasks
easier. One of the questions which arises in the mind is why
we need BCI systems? BCI system is a complex technology,
no doubt, however, leading to a simpler life.
Following are the main reasons why we need to focus on
this technology:

(ii) Making a decision and then performing a task takes
time, while operating a device using thoughts or
technically our brain waves is easier
(iii) Re-establishing communication path from the brain
to artiﬁcial limbs and assisting those aﬀected by
brain-related diseases
1.4.1. Individuals in Need of a BCI to Re-Establish Motor
Control and Communication. A wide range of neurological
diseases such as motor neuron diseases and spinal cord
injury may lead to severe paralysis of the motor muscles,
restricting the patient to control artiﬁcial devices through

only a few muscles and thereby termed as “locked-in,” while
people who have completely lost their motor control are
termed as “completely locked-in.”
Evident that the normal communication channel from
the brain to the limbs is lost, BCI is used to re-establish the
communication through an alternative route.
Even being applicable to a healthy person, BCI systems
can be used to employ numerous tasks from the users using
the signals generated from the brains to control applications
as presented in the following [4]:
(1) Noninvasive Brain-Computer Interface Research at the
Wadsworth Center. The research conducted at the

4

Scientiﬁc Programming

Wadsworth Center was to study diﬀerent approaches
employed in the BCI to control a computer screen cursor to
analyze their advantages and disadvantages; one approach
was sensory-based rhythm control in which the selected
features in the frequency domain were based on the potentials created by motor imagery and linear regression was
employed so that they can be converted as control signals to
move the cursor.
The other procedure was the P300-based cursor control
in which the user focuses attention on the desired symbol
and is provided with a 6 ∗ 6 matrix to produce time-varying
stimuli and linear regression is utilized to allow these signals
as a control input to move the cursor.
The research suggested that the BCI is an applicationoriented approach and depends entirely on user training; the
EEG features dictate the BCI system for speed, accuracy, bit
rate, and usefulness.
Sensorimotor Rhythms (SMR) is an approach employing
better results for control tasks such as controlling a screen
cursor, while the P300-BCI system was slower as compared
to the SMR-BCI.
(2) The Berlin Brain-Computer Interface: Machine LearningBased Detection of User-Speciﬁc Brain States. The researchers
for the Berlin brain-computer interface employed sensory
motor rhythms, i.e., thinking of moving the left hand or right
hand and used machine learning-based detection of the user
speciﬁc brain states. While testing their trained model, they
achieved an information transfer rate above 35 bits per
minute (bpm), and overall spelling seed was 4.5 letters per
minute including correcting the mistakes, using 128-channel
EEG and using feedback control for untrained users in order
to properly train the machine learning algorithms, thereby
reducing the training user time used in the voluntary control
approach [2].
1.5. Structure of the BCI. The steps of the brain computer
interface system include the following:
(1) Brain activity measurement/recording methods of
the BCI
(2) Preprocessing techniques
(3) Feature extraction
(4) Machine learning implementation/classiﬁcation
(5) Translation to control signal
1.5.1. Preprocessing. In BCI, preprocessing techniques consist of data acquisition of brain signals to check the signal
quality without losing important information; the recorded
signals are cleaned and conduct noise removal to acquire
relevant information encoded in the signal. As mentioned
above, the EEG signals are of poor quality; even the commercial 50 Hz frequency, due to nearby appliances, can
corrupt the EEG signals, and the users are also advised not to
think anything else apart from the stimuli as presented. In
preprocessing, using Fourier transform or Fourier series, the
signals are taken into the frequency domain and studied what

frequency content is present in the signal. The undesired
60 Hz frequency signal and undesired signal produced by
performing actions other than the said stimuli are then ﬁltered out using a notch ﬁlter as mentioned in Figure 3.
1.5.2. Feature Extraction. Feature extraction plays a vital
role in brain-computer interface applications; the raw EEG
signals are nonstationary signals that are corrupted by noise
or due to artifacts present in the environment where they are
being recorded, but still meaningful information can be
extracted from them. The data dimensionality is also reduced to process it better, and machine learning models are
applied. This method is essential to increase the classiﬁcation
accuracy of the BCI system.
EEG signal is a time-domain nonstationary signal, and
the relevant information such as signal energy is analyzed as
a function of time or frequency later; relevant statistic
measures are adapted to properly explain the characteristics
of the signal.
Some of the commonly used feature extraction techniques are listed as follows.
Short-time Fourier transform is a frequency-domain
feature extraction technique in which the EEG signal is
convolved with a window function w to extract the relevant
frequency features of the brain which are broken down as
sinusoids at diﬀerent frequency ranges.
Mathematically, it is represented as
L− 1

Xstft[m, n] � 􏽘 x[k]w[n − k]e− (j2πnk/L) ,

(1)

k�0

where x[k] is the input EEG and w[n – k] is the window
multiplied to extract the frequency features as shown in the
ﬁgure [4].
Discrete-time and continuous-time wavelet transform is
a time frequency-based feature extraction technique that
allows better temporal and spatial resolution in which the
EEG signals are produced in the form of wavelets at diﬀerent
frequency ranges of interest as shown in Figure 4.
The technique of wavelet transforms as adapted in the
literature is a ﬁltering continuous application of high-pass
and low-pass ﬁlters to extract the wavelets of the signal
which, when added together, constitute the original signal
and downsampled by a factor of 2 as shown in Figure 5.
g and h are consecutive high-pass and low-pass ﬁlters
which produce the relevant detailed and approximated
coeﬃcients of the EEG signals [5].
1.5.3. Neural Networks. Before starting to explain what deep
learning is, it is ﬁrst beneﬁcial to explain the role of deep
learning and its fundamental blocks.
Deep learning is a classiﬁcation tool used in a variety of
daily applications which is composed of speech recognition
and computer vision to natural language processing in the
context of the BCI; the input features which are diﬀerent
brain frequency bands are classiﬁed according to what activity the user is performing at the moment.

The neural network does not get its right output at the
ﬁrst attempt. It needs to be trained a lot, and so a training
rule is assigned to neural networks to get the right output.
Many training rules are adapted, but one of the most
commonly used is the delta rule, and the rule is expressed
using the following equation:

Hz
30

Neural Network. A neural network is a model similar to that
of a neuron in our brain that has input nodes and output
nodes; the mathematical model for a neural network is given
by the following equation:
v � wx + b,

(2)

where v is the weighted sum of the inputs and the bias term
which will be fed at the output node, b is a bias term which is
mostly set to 1, and w is the random weights assigned that
are multiplied with the input in order to reach closer to the
desire output.
The neural network is shown in Figure 6.
These calculations are often preceded in the form of
matrices; the input, the weight terms, the output, and the
bias are as follows:
v � w1 × x1 􏼁 + w2 × x2 􏼁 + w3 × x3 􏼁 + b.

(3)

Finally, the output node is passed to an activation
function and provides the ﬁnal output; the activation
function calculates the characteristic of the node. The activation function acts to map the corresponding inputs to the
right output y present at the output node:
y � φ(v).

(4)

wij ⟵wij + αei xj ,

(5)

where xj represents the number of inputs, ei is the error
generated at the output node, and α is the learning rule
between (0 < α < 1).
The training rule is summarized as follows:
(1) Assign adequate values to the weights.
(2) Obtain the input from the training data and feed it
into the neural network which will give an output d;
subtract the output d to obtain the correct output at
the output node.
ei � di − yi .

(6)

(3) Calculate the weight updates:
Δwij � αei xj .

(7)

(4) Adjust the weights accordingly until the correct
output or that has small tolerance is obtained:
wij ⟵wij + wij .

becoming better with the cost of greater memory, but with
higher classiﬁcation accuracy, we use deep neural networks
which are the same as the single-layer neural network but
with hidden layers added in between the input and output
nodes, as shown in Figure 7.
The concepts are similar to those of a single neural
network but with the adjustments of added hidden layers
and a diﬀerent training rule because the delta rule has a
drawback of not propagating the output to the hidden layers,
thereby the weights are not adjusted.
To explain how the deep neural network works, the
above explained single neural network is set as basis.
In Figure 8, given a multiple-layered neural network, the
weighted sum obtained at the ﬁrst hidden layer is presented
as

Subtract the output d to obtain the correct output at
the output node and the delta (δ) of the output

Deep learning training rule is given in the following.
Backpropagation algorithm is commonly used as the
training instruction for the deep neural networks; the
procedure is summarized as follows:

Now, the alpha-beta ranges are extracted, and consecutive energies are calculated. The features are fed into the
deep learning neural network, and using the backpropagation learning rule, the model is trained, yielding an
accuracy of 97.83%, as shown in Figure 9 [5].

2. Critical Review of the Related Literature
A brain-computer interface involves various stages, and
development in each stage leads to an improved and eﬃcient
system. Here, the literature review of major steps including
data acquisition, feature extraction, classiﬁcation algorithm,
and applications is presented.
(1) Improvement of EEG signal acquisition: An electrical aspect for state of the art of front end.
Computational intelligence and neuroscience: a
research paper published by Ali Bulent Usakli, the
NCO Academy, Turkey, presented some applicable
concerns for acquiring quality EEG signals which
are proven helpful for users and design engineers.
One of the most important considerations is
selecting suitable electrodes and headset. In the
EEG-based BCI, electrodes, signal processing
components including mental and environmental
conditions, ﬁltration of noise, ampliﬁcation, signal
translation, and data storage aﬀect the recording
process. The data acquisition is an important step in
any machine learning procedure. Brain signals need
to be cleaned and preprocessed so that a good result
can be obtained [1].
(2) P300 wave detection using Emotiv Epoc+ headset:
eﬀects of matrix size, ﬂash duration, and colors:
Saleh Ibrahim Alzahrani conducted research on
P300 wave detection using the Emotive Epoc+
headset to study the eﬀects of the size of the matrix,
ﬂash duration, and colors. In this study, P300
signals were obtained from ﬁve subjects with
Emotive EPOC+ using all 14 channels. For this
research, EEG signals obtained were communicated
to software OpenViBE through a USB dongle. A
sample was taken every 8 seconds at a rate of 128
samples per second. The conﬁgured sampling rate
provides ample samples for the four frequency
bands, containing signiﬁcant ERP data. During
process of signal recording, the subjects were shown
a matrix of 6 × 6 or 3 × 3 on the computer screen.
They were instructed to stay calm, avoid any
needless movement, and set all on letter which they
desire to spell. It is reported in the study that one of
the advantages of using the Emotiv EPOC+ headset
is that it takes merely two to three minutes for
preparation as compared to other headsets that take
more than ten minutes. The quality of sensors is
veriﬁed through Emotiv Xavier SDK which provides feedback report of each sensor. To decrease
the contact impedance, saline liquid was applied to
the sensor surface. Primary objective was to assess
the potential of Emotiv EPOC+ to perceive P300
signals. Finding the electrodes proﬁcient at providing target signals helps minimize the number of
channels which makes signal processing a lot easier.
The results of this experiment provide evidence of

the capability of Emotiv EPOC+ to detect the P300
signals from two channels, O1 and O2 [2].
Automatic seizure detection in SEEG using high
frequency activities in wavelet domain. Medical
engineering and physics: in this research paper, the
researcher has found the method for detection of
seizures using the high-frequency analysis in the
wavelet domain. This method is used highly in the
high-frequency domain. Because of seizer detection,
the method is usually done using high frequency in
the range of 80–250 Hz. Also, it can handle fast
ripples in the range of 250 to 500 Hz. The biggest
advantage in the seizure detection is that it can
detect the seizure oﬀset. The methodology consists
of the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT),
which was computed by convolving the SEEG signal
which has to make the feature extraction, and it also
includes the complex conjugate of the wavelet basis
function (Ayoubian, 2013).
Classiﬁcation of epilepsy EEG signals using DWTbased envelope analysis and neural network ensemble: envelope detection is a very eﬃcient
method for detecting the impact of the signals
which are based on the biological change or diagnosis. In this paper, the researchers used the Hilbert
transform which has a good impact on the resultant
signals so that the signals are then widespread using
the DWH technique which has a unique behavior
regarding the biological change; the researchers
detected the changes using this method [5].
Feature selection for motor imagery EEG classiﬁcation based on ﬁreﬂy algorithm and learning
automata: in this research paper, the researchers
implemented spectral linear discriminant analysis
for the classiﬁcation of motor imagery signals.
Feature extraction method used was basically
common spatial patterns; the advantage of using
this feature extraction method is basically of twoclass discrimination problems. This maximizes the
variance of one class and decreases the variance of
the other class, which is the advantage, but the
disadvantage is because of the multiclass overlap
structure in this method, it is not used for multiclass
prediction [6].
Unsupervised adaptation of electroencephalogram
signal processing based on fuzzy C-means algorithm. International Journal of Adaptive Control
and Signal Processing: this research paper presented
the techniques of brain mapping with emphasis on
multichannel EEG and functional brain imaging
techniques. During training and testing, the concentration of the subject on the target object is one
of the concerns which signiﬁes the capacity to
operate a device. They have used diﬀerent algorithms such as LDA and fuzzy C-means. Fuzzy Cmeans is an adaptive classiﬁer, and this is probably

used where the device behavior is not synchronized
with the classiﬁcation model [7].
(7) A review of classiﬁcation algorithms for EEG-based
brain-computer interfaces: a 10-year update: this
paper is the latest review of the BCI classiﬁcation
techniques; there are some algorithms discussed in
this paper taken from diﬀerent papers, and their
accuracies, optimization, the method of feature
extraction used were compared, and every algorithm has its own advantages and disadvantages. In
this paper, they have used the event-related potentials. Feature extraction method they have used
is based on spatial ﬁltering which is the most optimized ﬁlter; it can further be optimized by using
the calibration [8].
(8) Sequential non-stationary dynamic classiﬁcation
with sparse feedback: in this research paper, basically, they have discussed the technique for the
classiﬁcation of the nonstationary and nonlinear
signals. As we know that the BCI signals are
nonstationary in nature, sparse feedback can be
used for the stability of the brain signals and
classifying them using the RBF classiﬁers which are
radial basis functions. The signals are acquired in a
nonlinear manner, and we can apply linear models
to them, but again, multiclass prediction is not able

feedback matrices involved [9].

researched about the technique for the motor
imaginary signals by the imagination of the left
hand, right hand, and foot movements. In the
neurofeedback method, real-time prediction of
brain signals is diﬃcult to achieve. We have nonlinear signals at the input of the neurofeedback

method so that we can use the Hidden Markov
Method (HMM) to make predictions in real time
but the accuracy is a tradeoﬀ [10].
(10) Toward unsupervised adaptation of LDA for braincomputer interfaces. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering: the ﬁreﬂy algorithm (FA) is an
eﬃcient algorithm for selecting the most appropriate subset of features and helps improving accuracy of classiﬁcation. When the problem of
entrapping of FA in the local optimum arises, a
procedure for combining the ﬁreﬂy algorithm and
learning automata (LA) is proposed which optimizes feature selection for motor imagery EEG. For
the expected outcome of the high-dimensional
feature set, a process of combining the common
spatial pattern (CSP) and local characteristic-scale
decomposition (LCD) algorithms is used. It is
further classiﬁed by the use of the spectral regression discriminant analysis (SRDA) classiﬁer [11].

Table 2 shows the comparison of classiﬁcation algorithms.

4. Discussion
There is a large range of classiﬁers developed by scientists
and engineers around the world. These classiﬁcation algorithms can be divided into four groups.
4.1. Adaptive Classiﬁers. Adaptive classiﬁers are listed as
those classiﬁers in which parameters are progressively
recalculated and also updated with procurement of new EEG
data signals which are nonstationary, and adaptive classiﬁers
are capable to follow the change in the feature distribution.

Utilizing the features and associated labels, two linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) classiﬁers were trained, with

others.
Features related to subject’s control brain signals are
extracted and constantly classiﬁed by the oﬄine LDA algorithm. These features are then used to control the robot.
They used parameters of the LDA algorithm in place of
accommodating threshold and dwell features. Subject’s
control intention and timing is the basis for adaptation for
online training. The methodology proposed entailed information about the user’s control needed to train and adapt
which could show promise of improving the accuracy and
performance. The paper used Kalman ﬁlters for online
parameters to be classiﬁed using LDA. Event label assignment was introduced with a slower learning process [12].
One of the advantages of implementing adaptive classiﬁers is that they can employ both supervised and unsupervised. This means that even if there is no information of
true labels of data being received, they can be executed. From
multiple research studies, it is inferred that unsupervised
learning has yielded better results than static classiﬁers.
Now, most of the real-world applications of BCI do not
present class labels, and for this purpose, unsupervised
adaption classiﬁers require more development [7].
4.2. Matrix and Tensor Classiﬁers. The approach which the
researchers have used in this paper holds fewer stages for
classiﬁcation as compared to the classical machine learning
algorithms, and they are simpler as well.. Compared to other
standard classiﬁers, Riemannian classiﬁer does not need any
parameter-tuning techniques such as cross validation to
properly train and verify the accuracy of the produced
model, which makes it far more robust and accurate all due
to its logarithmic tendencies. Likewise, the inborn Riemannian separation for the SPD matrix is invariant both to
inversion of the matrix and to any direct invertible change of
the information, for example, any outside interference added
to the EEG sources does not change the separations among
the witnessed covariance matrices. These properties partially
clarify why Riemannian classiﬁcation techniques give a
decent speculation ability, which empowered analysts to set
up adjustment-free versatile ERP-BCIs utilizing basic subject-to-subject and session-to-session exchange learning
methodologies [9].
It is shown that several approaches were implemented
and gave higher performance than CSP + LDA procedures
on motor imagery EEG data. The biggest advantage is
quality performance. However, this is a gain at tradeoﬀ
between performance and greater number of weights
because of elevated expansion in input feature dimensionality which makes suitable regularization a muchneeded step [12].
EEG data can be represented in the form of tensors and
are treated as analysis tools for EEG data tools for EEG data
analysis which includes feature extraction, data clustering,
and data classiﬁcation in the BCI. EEG data are represented
in more than one dimension; this includes time, frequency
space, and trails and hence, these are presented by the tensor
order. EEG data that have time frequency and space can be

11
represented by 3-dimensional tensor. Tensors have been
used frequently for motor imagery-based analysis even with
a large amount of data containing diﬀerent categories which
can be represented by the tensor and its order [10].
4.3. Transfer Learning and Deep Learning. Transfer learning is
a crucial tool when it comes to session-to-session and subjectto-subject decoding performance. If transfer learning is improved enough, BCI system can be operated without calibration, and this will revolutionize the BCI systems forever.
It is observed that calibration sessions are strenuous and
mentally exhausting for subjects. It is explained that
accepting the input from the earliest starting point of their
BCI system is promising for started subjects.
Deep learning is categorized as a ML algorithm, where
features and the classiﬁer are collectively learned straight from
EEG data. There exist multiple deep learning algorithms. One
of the most explored and commonly used is deep neural
networks (DNNs). DNN is also performed online for slow
cortical potentials (SCP) and motion-onset visual evoked
potential (MVEP) which are not commonly used. The very
ﬁrst research conducted and paper was published on the
P300-based BCI by Cicotte et al. Two convolutional layers
were constructed followed by completely connected layer.
One convolutional layer has a purpose to learn spatial ﬁlters
and the second one was to learn temporal ﬁlters. The model
was proven better than the P300 experiment, but the SVM
model had more accuracy [2].
Deep extreme learning machine is used for Slow Cortical
Potentials (SCP) classiﬁcations. This technique consists of
multiple layers, and the last one was Kernal ELM. However,
in this project, number of units, network structure,
hyperparameter, and input features were not reasoned. This
did not prove to be better than multiplayer ELM or standard
ELM [4].
4.4. Miscellaneous Classiﬁers. In order to classify more than
two mental tasks, two main approaches can be used to obtain
a multiclass classiﬁcation function. The ﬁrst approach
consists in directly estimating the class using multiclass
techniques such as decision trees, multilayer perceptron,
naive Bayes classiﬁers, or k-nearest neighbors. The second
approach consists of decomposing the problem into several
binary classiﬁcation problems.
Multiclass and multilabel approaches therefore aim to
recognize more than two commands. It is therefore necessary to choose carefully the mapping between mental
commands and corresponding labels. However, the errors
may be possible during the classiﬁcation. In particular, the
set of estimated labels, sometimes, may not correspond to
any class, and several classes may be at equal distances, thus
causing class confusion [13].

5. Methodology
Here are some methods which are discussed in the research
papers for the past few years in brain-computer interface
systems, as shown in Table 3.

6. Conclusion

References

During this course of work, a question arises whether it is
possible to create a brain computer interface which is
aﬀordable, with high accuracy and optimization. So, after
reviewing diﬀerent papers, the conclusion is that if we
need an optimized model with high accuracy for the
noninvasive technique of brain signals, the artiﬁcial
neural network has a high accuracy and is optimal.
However, there are some tradeoﬀs as well that are model
compatibility with the brain signals. From 10 years of BCI
review, we have obtained that the ANN has a high response and accuracy; after all, it optimizes the system as
well. However, further research studies have been done to
make it more accurate because this has to be used in
health care.
Due to the fast processing that ANN allows, a form of
guidance could be provided during training that enables a
user to improve the classiﬁer’s performance and let it reﬂect
his/her intents more often. This guidance was very useful for
one of the three subjects.
Also, the statistical test was examined on whether it
performs in a way that can be expected. Therefore, after the
oﬄine classiﬁcation, it yielded an accuracy above 90 percent.
The control provided by the developed system has been
suﬃcient to conclude that it provides enough control that a
user can command an arbitrary computerized device. Also,
it showed to be easily trainable.
In the future, the proposed model can provide support on multiplatforms. This can be achieved by developing applications which can help humanity and make
everyday tasks easier. Furthermore, the system can be
controlled with a smartphone that can override EEG
headset commands. This will act as fail-safe if the BCI
system experiences any malfunctioning. On the basis of
this development, better EEG can be designed with
higher eﬃciency and which is less dependent on oﬄine
classiﬁcation.
