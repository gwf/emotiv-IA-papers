Introduction: Recent research from both human and animal studies conﬁrms that
cognitive training gains a considerable effect on multiple cognitive domains in older
adults with mild cognitive impairment. Previous studies have yet paid scant attention to
executive function training. Little is known about whether this speciﬁc beneﬁt translates to
maintaining long-term effectiveness and transfer effects are. This study is designed as an
effort to address this issue.
Objective: The program aimed to evaluate the effect of process-based multi-task
cognitive training on executive function and further explore its long-term effects and
transfer effects in older adults with MCI. Furthermore, we will explore the neural correlates
latent the changed performances underlying the cognitive intervention.
Methods: This program is a single-blinded, randomized, prospective clinical trial to test
the effect of process-based multi-task cognitive training in older adults with MCI. Ninety
participants with MCI will be recruited and randomly assigned to the cognitive training
group (n=45) and the wait-list control group (n=45). The cognitive training group will
receive 10 weeks of process-based multi-task cognitive training and health education
twice a week, at 40~60 min per session. While the wait-list control group will only receive
10 weeks of health education during the research period. The effect is measured using the
executive function, neuropsychological assessment performance and related brain activity
assessed with electroencephalogram parameters (slowness and complexity of the EEG)
at baseline, after 10 weeks of training, and a 3-month follow-up.
Results: The study is currently ongoing. Recruitment began in March 2019 and will
conclude at the end of 2020. Effects of the process-based multi-task cognitive training on
executive function in older adults with MCI will be described in intention-to-treat analysis

and protocol set principle. We will also explore the potential long-term effects and transfer
effects.
Discussion: If a process-based multi-task cognitive training program results in positive
changes to executive function in older adults with MCI, this might provide a viable and
potential approach to delay the cognitive decline.

often develop into AD after 1 year than those with higher
executive function (12). Recently, a growing body of researches
on cognitive training has focused on executive dysfunction and
found that it could improve executive function performance (13–
15). The improvements in executive function are potentially
extremely relevant with daily living capacities of older adults (11,
16). Therefore, executive function is considered to be a crucial
cognitive domain of the prevention and treatment of MCI.
Cognitive training as a means to counteract cognition decline
with high practical operability and no side effects, and has
demonstrated its beneﬁts on cognitive function for the older adults
with MCI (17–19). In 2017, a review commissioned by the American
Academy of Neurology (AAN) recommended that cognitive
training may be provided with a beneﬁcial practice in improving
measures of cognitive function in older adults with MCI (4).
Meanwhile, older adults with MCI in early-stage beneﬁt from
neural reorganization, which were induced by cognitive training
targeting at executive function (18, 20). Neuroimaging ﬁndings also
have indicated that cognitive training focus on executive function for
normal elderly has been associated with increased neurocognitive
activation and cognitive control network connectivity (e.g.,
frontoparietal network, occipito-temporal regions) (21, 22).
Therefore, executive function as a successful compensatory
mechanism for cognition improvement could be signiﬁcant (19, 20).
However, some systematic reviews and RCT studies have
reported several limitations frequently occurred in the cognitive
training, including an emphasis on single-modality training tasks
(23), failure to adjust the cognitive training tasks and the level
of difﬁculty on the training tasks throughout the process of
cognitive training (24), and transfer effects of cognitive training to
other untrained cognitive domain can be little known (15). Besides,
studies of process-based executive function training revealed that
more considerable training-related beneﬁts in older adults than in
younger adults (25, 26). However, previous process-based cognitive
training studies in older adults with MCI did not put sufﬁcient
training on the executive function (18, 19).
It remains not entirely clear how cognitive training related
mechanisms affect executive function in older adults with MCI.
Electroencephalography analysis provides a good indication of
the neurological integrity of the central nervous system (27),
which would increase our insight into the mechanisms of any
potential effects of cognitive training targeting at executive
function (28).

HIGHLIGHTS
1. This paper describes the process-based multi-task cognitive
training program study, an implementation study to improve
the effect on executive function in community elderly with
mild cognitive impairment in China. This is the ﬁrst nurseled cognitive training program conducted in the community
of Zhejiang Province.
2. Previous studies have yet paid scant attention to executive
function training. The program adapts the maximum of the
optimal training volume to explore whether adequate
training could improve executive function.
3. It provides an example of a more cost-effective and feasible
cognitive training method and uses dynamic and hierarchical
tasks to implement efﬁciency and suitable.

BACKGROUND
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents an intermediate
state between normal or healthy ageing and early-stage dementia
(1). The annual progression rate from MCI to AD or other types
of dementia is 10%~59.4% (2–4), while the proportion from
healthy elderly to AD is only 1%~3% (5, 6). Practice guidelines
and meta-analysis reported that 14.4%~55.6% of those with MCI
revert to normal cognition (NC) (4, 5, 7). The reversion from
MCI to NC maybe beneﬁt from appropriate cognition
management/intervention (8). Therefore, the stage of MCI
provides a critical window of opportunity for the prevention
and treatment of dementia.
Although memory impairment is a major manifestation of
MCI, preclinical deﬁcits in executive function are widely
observed in older adults with MCI (9, 10). Seo pointed out that
executive function has been shown to interact with memory
function (10). More importantly, the executive function is a
crucial predictive factor in dementia prognosis (11). Older adults
with MCI with lower executive function demonstrated more

shown in Figure 1. This program will consist of two arms: the
cognitive training group (process-based multi-task cognitive
training and health education classes) and the wait-list control
group (health education classes). The wait-list group will access
to attend the same program after the cognitive training group
had completed a 3-month follow-up.
Participants are community-dwelling older adults, both men
and women, aged 60 years or older who meet Petersen criteria
will be included (31). Participants who meet the following
criteria will be allowed to withdraw from this program, having
severe medical events that occurred during the training or
follow-up period, and should not continue to receive this
program, reluctant themselves in training at any time, and a
major protocol violation. Detailed inclusion and exclusion
criteria are listed in Table 1. This study will be carried out
following the recommendations of SPIRIT Guidelines with
written informed consent from all participants who meet
inclusion criteria or their surrogate family members. Ethical
approval was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of
the Third People’s Huzhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province
(number 2018-030).
The calculation of sample size is based on the change in
executive function after 10-week, which is the primary outcome
variable in this study. A meta-analysis found that signiﬁcant
beneﬁts of cognitive training are superior to the wait-list and the
effect size of executive function training used to calculate the
sample size is 0.575 [0.093,1.056] (18, 19). Sample size estimation
was conducted using statistical software G*power. In the analysis

Given that the limitations of cognitive training for older
adults with MCI reported by previous researches, we developed
a process-based multi-tasks cognitive training program based on
the process model (29, 30), which was targeted to improve the
executive function of older adults with MCI. The primary aim of
this study is to evaluate whether the process-based multi-task
cognitive training program would provide better results on
executive function in older adults with MCI. The secondary
aim is to explore whether potential training effects will be able to
generalize to other untrained cognitive domains (transfer
effects), and those effects will be maintained effectiveness over
3 months of follow-up (maintaining effect). The tertiary aim is to
explore the changed performances of brain neural activity
underlying the process-based cognitive training targeting at
executive function.

commence with verbal instruction from the trained researcher
regarding how to use the socket cylinder and what are the tasks
involved. The trained researcher will receive 10 h of training and
an intervention manual containing a simpliﬁed version of the
cognitive training task with illustrations. Participants who fail to
complete the task within the set time will be given proper
technique guides, but the researchers will not help them
complete the tasks.

Study Intervention
Implementation of the Cognitive Training Program
Participants in the cognitive training group will receive 10 weeks
of the process-based multi-task cognitive training program with
60 min group training sessions (a small group of six participants)
each given three times per week. This cognitive training program
consisted of eleven training tasks in total, with a varying degree
of overlap between tasks. The tasks are divided into three
categories: 1) warm-up exercise; 2) practice in order; and 3)
expanding training (Table 2). The task of warm-up exercise
lasting 10 min, practice in order and expanding training tasks
lasting 50 min. All cognitive tasks are completed within a
medical university setting supervision of postgraduate in
Master of Nursing Specialist. The program ensures that the
ratio of a participant-to-researcher is no greater than 6:1 (6
participants per researcher). Each training task for all nursing
specialists was randomly assigned. During the training period,
the participant will have an identical training schedule. To
balance the social-interaction effect, participants in the
cognitive training group participated in the same health
education program as the wait-list control group. Participants
were reminded via smartphone to complete their training
program if missing over 2 weeks. Besides, we develop a
training paper record form, and the training record can
be checked.

Difﬁculty Level
The difﬁculty level, rounds, and progression of cognitive training
will be individualized (33). There are 8 levels of difﬁculty in
cognitive training, and 64 same difﬁculties in each level (except
for the task of Stereoscopic cylinders training and Hunt for the
colors). The completion time or error frequency of three
consecutive training sessions are less than 80% compared with
the ﬁrst attempt, and the training difﬁculty level will increase. In
contrast, the completion time or error frequency of three
consecutive training sessions are better than 50% compared
with the ﬁrst attempt, and the training difﬁculty will decrease.
The completion time or error frequency of three consecutive
training sessions are 50% to 80% compared with the ﬁrst
attempt; the training difﬁculty level will increase conversely;
the training difﬁculty level will remain unchanged. Besides, to
maintain the challenge and maximize performance, the
participants who have not increased the difﬁculty level for
three consecutive weeks will be required to attempt a higher
level of difﬁculty. Each task is presented ﬁrst at its simplest level,
and each subsequent task is a variation of previously mastered
skills as the complexity increases.

Control Intervention
Intervention Tool

Participants in the control group are on the waiting list and will
receive 10 weeks of health education classes twice a week, at
40~60 min per session. The wait-list group will access to attend

A brief description of the tasks

Firstly, introduce yourself one by one (i.e., name, age, occupation). Then, inform participants to
remember these names. The participants are asked to write down the names of the other ﬁve on
white paper according to their memory at the end of cognitive training.
Firstly, participants were divided into three groups of two. Then, one participant facing the audience
uses the most accurate body language to express the meaning of words, while other participants
with their backs to the audience are asked to guess those words. Each group is limited to 2 min.
Firstly, take any set of socket cylinder socket*, make the cylinder out of the socket, placed near the
corresponding socket block, then throw the order of a group of cylinders into confusion. The
participants will be required to place each cylinder into appropriate holes in a long wooden socket
block with the left-to-right or the right-to-left order. There are sixty-four cylinder socket
combinations. With more socket cylinders and change in combination model shown, the difﬁculty
level increases.
Firstly, take any set of socket cylinder socket, make the cylinder out of the socket, placed near the
corresponding socket block, then throw the order of a group of cylinders into confusion. A wooden
cylinder was selected and placed it into the participant’s hand. The participants will be required to
ﬁnd the corresponding position of each cylinder and place it into appropriate holes in a long
wooden socket block. With more socket cylinders and changes in the combination model shown,
the difﬁculty level increases.
Firstly, take any set of socket cylinder socket on the table, make the cylinder out of the socket,
placed socket block on another table. The participants will be required to select suitable cylinders
that were shown in the ﬁrst group and place each cylinder into appropriate holes in a long wooden
socket block with the left-to-right or the right-to-left order according to their memory. With more
socket cylinders and changes in the combination model shown, the difﬁculty level increases.
The participants will be required to complete a task on level 1 (Match the cylinders) with eyes
closed. With more socket cylinders and changes in the combination model shown, the difﬁculty
level increases.
The participants will be required to complete a task on level 2 (Match the socket apertures) with
eyes closed. With more socket cylinders and changes in the combination model shown, the
difﬁculty level increases.
Firstly, take any set of socket cylinder socket with colors ** (Brand Name: DAWONMONTESSORI;
Model Number: DW 1002). Then the participants will be required to complete a task on level 1
(Match the cylinders). With more socket cylinders and changes in the combination model shown,
the difﬁculty level increases.
Firstly, take any group of cylinder with colors**. Participants were asked to stack two or more
cylinders high according to the card. The card consists of nine squares of the same size. Forty
cylinders of different colors and diameters are inside the nine square randomly. The cylinder is not
evenly distribute in the square. With more number of stacks, the difﬁculty level increases.
Firstly, take any set of socket cylinder socket with colors (red or green, blue, yellow) are shown.
Then the participants will be required to complete a task on level 1 (Match the cylinders) according
to cylinder color card (the time of observing card should not exceed 60 s). With more socket
cylinders and changes in the combination model shown, the difﬁculty level increases.

*The ﬁrst set of cylinders increases in depths and widths, the second set of cylinders only increases in depths with the same widths, the third set of cylinders only increases in widths with
the same depths and the last set of cylinders increases in widths but decreases in depths.
**The Cylinders are four sets of wooden cylinders, each a different color with varying widths and depths as same as the cylinder blocks.

examination and neurologic diagnosis of MCI. Participants
who met the eligibility criteria will be assessed with a baseline
assessment and then given the EEG evaluation in the 2 days
preceding the start of the cognitive training.
After that, according to the random allocation sequence,
participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups
with a targeted assignment ratio of 1:1. The random allocation
sequence with a block size of four will be generated using a
computer randomization list by an independent researcher
assistant. The random allocation sequence is sealed in opaque
envelopes by an assistant. The cognitive training group will
receive cognitive intervention and health education, whereas
the wait-list control group will only receive health education
during the research period. During the 3 months follow up, the

conducting mental health nursing and neuropsychological
assessments, conducted a set of outcome measures. A more
detailed account of study assessments and timelines are
illustrated in Table 3.
The primary outcome measure is the composite z score
executive function, which will be accessed by Trail Making
Test A-B (TMT A-B), Stroop test (using software, E-Prime
2.0.10.42), and Purdue pegboard test (PPT, Lafayette
Instrument Model 32020A). The selection of cognitive
evaluation measures, directly relating to the target cognitive
ﬁeld of training, can improve cognitive training power, efﬁcacy
and increase accuracy (34, 35). Furthermore, previous studies
have shown that the use of TMT A-B, Stroop tests, and PPT as
executive function outcome measures in clinical trials of MCI
(36, 37). We will calculate z-score composites from normalized
raw data for each item and its score as a sum of all domains.
The secondary outcome measures include neuropsychological
assessments, transfer effect and electroencephalogram
acquisition. Neuropsychological assessments are as follows: (1)

cognitive training group and wait-list control group will receive
no interventions. Complete all outcome assessments,
participants in the wait-list control group will be permitted to
undergo the process-based multi-task cognitive training
program. Although it was not initially the plan, the health
education manual for mild cognitive impairment will be
provided for participants who are not ﬁnishing the cognitive
training or health education through various means, such as
email, public platform, and short messaging service. All outcome
measurements will be assessed at baseline, 10 weeks and 3
months follow up. Study assessments and timelines are
illustrated in Table 3.

Outcome Measurement
Data evaluators and training practitioners are blinded to group
assignments. All outcome measures are assessed at baseline,
immediately after 10 weeks of training, and again at follow-up
3 months after the end of cognitive training. Three trained
research assistants, with a minimum of 2 years’ experience

the composite z score for the overall cognitive function,
including the questionnaire of MoCA (38); (2) the
Psychomotor speed, which will be accessed by Finger Tapping
Test (37) and Reaction Time test (39). The transfer effects
measure consist of ﬂuid reasoning and working memory. Two
tasks will be used to measure working memory: digit span
forward and backward from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence
Scale-Revised. Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM)
will be used to assess ﬂuid reasoning. The electroencephalogram
data will be recorded and collected using the Emotiv EPOC®
Headset (EMO-EPO-BT9X-03) with 14 channels mobile (AF3,
F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, and AF4) and
two references (CMS/DRL references at P3/P4; left/right mastoid
process alternative). The parameters are as follows: the sampling
rate is 128 Hz, the resolution is 14 bits with 1 LSB (= 0.51mV),
and bandwidth is 0.16–43Hz (digital notch ﬁlters at 50Hz and
60Hz). The recording time will last approximately 5 min. The
participants will be required to close and open their eyes for 30 s,
respectively. During data acquisition time, the participants will
be told not to move their hands and other parts of the body (40).

will compare the characteristics of the completed participants
versus dropout ones. Sensitivity analyses of completed
participants will be further performed to explore the potential
for dropout participants, and the results will be categorized as
bias. Listwise deletion will be adopted to estimate treatment
effects and sensitivity of the cluster dropout if missing values
satisfy the criteria of the losing data entirely at random;
otherwise, multiple imputation data strategies will be adopted.
Data processing and statistical analysis will be conducted
using SPSS 21.0 and MatLab (The Mathworks Inc. 2016).
Descriptive statistics will be reported as frequencies for
categorical variables and means ± standard deviations for
continuous variables. The adoption mainly the method of
exploratory analysis to examine the distribution state of data.
The proportionality of baseline data for both groups is compared
by the non-parameters Wilcoxon test, chi-square test, and t-test.
Regarding the primary outcome, a repeated ANOVA test will be
used to evaluate the differences of changes and long-term effect
in outcome measurement index performance in the cognitive
training group and the wait-list control group, within-group over
time, and interaction effects. The simple effect analysis will be
added when there is an interaction between intervention factors
and time factors. Secondary outcomes will be analyzed using
similar statistical methods. The mediating effect model was used
to test the transfer effect of cognitive training on untrained
cognitive domains, with cognitive training as the mediator. A
signiﬁcant statistical will be considered as P < 0.05 for all
comparisons. The effect size (r) was calculated using Cohen’s d
to estimate the between-group effect sizes.

Statistical Analysis
Pre-Processing of Electroencephalogram Data
The actual electroencephalogram signals are recorded using a
six-channel conﬁguration at F7, F8, T7, T8, O1, and O2 (Emotiv
EPOC® Headset -EMO-EPO-BT9X-03). Lakshmi et al. (41)
pointed out that the acquired brain signals are contaminated
by noise and artefacts (e.g., eye blinks, eye movements and
heartbeat). Besides, interference of muscle movements and
power lines are also mingled with brain signals (42).
Meanwhile, artefact avoidance is an effective preventive
method to minimize artefacts by instructing participants to try
to avoid unnecessary blinks, hand/body movements. Therefore,
it is necessary to remove artefacts from EEG signals by ﬁltering
and feature extraction process.
At ﬁrst, wavelet denoising is used to preprocess the raw data.
By eliminating high frequency, the wavelet method is performed
to obtain the ﬁner signal and enhance the effect of noise removal
of artefacts (43). Then, a sixth-order band-pass ﬁlter with cut-off
frequencies of 3 Hz and 13 Hz used in this study to ﬁlter the
denoised EEG signals. Its purpose is to ﬁlter the electromyogram
artefacts that tend to remove the unimportant information from
high-frequency bands and electrocardiogram that tend to
dominate the low-frequency. The next process is feature
extraction. Previous studies suggested that principal
component analysis is an efﬁcient method the feature
extraction (44). Finally, the results of the feature extraction
principal component analysis then processed to obtain
electroencephalogram spectra of normal condition.

DISCUSSION
Mild cognitive impairment is a current society challenge.
Cognitive training has a positive ﬁnding in speciﬁc cognitive
functions with the possibility of greater beneﬁts in individuals
with MCI. A meta-analysis study has shown that cognitive
training is a practical approach for protecting against cognitive
decline (19). Despite this evidence, the alleged positive effects of
cognitive training on cognition are yet to reach an agreement.
Questions about the relationship between latent the changed
performances and neural correlates remain unclear. One primary
challenge in implementing cognitive training in the community
is the lack of nurse-led cognitive training programs. Given
community health care resources in China, only a few large
cities can provide professional cognitive trainers and mental
health therapists (33). In this study, the process-based multi-task
cognitive training program is a randomized controlled trial
designed based on a process model. It aims to assess the
efﬁcacy of executive function, cognitive function and long-term
effect of transfer effects in the community elderly with MCI and
determine related neural correlates.
The process-based cognitive training targets more general
processing functions (e.g. executive function) (45, 46) and were
less affected by the brain or cognitive reserve (25). A study has
suggested that process-based cognitive training is feasible to

Statistical Considerations
The primary and secondary outcome measures were analyzed
using data from the intention-to-treat. Moreover, the protocol
set principle was deﬁned as those participants or the participants
who completed at least 80% adherence to the program initially
formulated and assessments all the required will be included. We

characteristics of individuals with MCI. In this study, older
adults with MCI who have colour blindness would be
excluded. Thereby the result will be limited in informing the
cognitive beneﬁt generalisability. Second, considering the
feasibility, we do not set up an active control group, which
may compromise the statistical power. Third, the follow-up
cognitive training in this study was limited to 3 months
because we will provide compensable training for the wait-list
control group after the follow-up period. Hence, conclusions
regarding the longer follow-up effectiveness of the process-based
multi-task cognitive training program could not be drawn.
Future study should further explore the above research gaps.
In summary, our cognitive training program, implemented by
socket cylinder and use of dynamic and hierarchical tasks (the
difﬁculty increases as the participants’ performance improves), is
easy to complete in older adults with MCI. This use dynamic and
hierarchical tasks and multi-modal testing (paper-pencil, computer)
will not only provide reliable data on cognitive training and transfer
effects but also assure compliance and motivation of participants.
The training program is valid, and the effects of training can be
sustained will play a vital role in the application of cognitive training
in the elderly with MCI. If proven effective, the results of this
protocol will be relevant to community health workers to adopt a
more cost-effective and feasible cognitive training method for
improving the cognitive status, executive function, psychomotor
speed, and non-trained cognitive domains.

improve executive function and reveal the possibilities of broader
generalizations of training effects in healthy older adults (13), as well
as in older adults with MCI (47). Sandberg et al. (13) reported that 5
weeks of executive process training sessions signiﬁcantly enhanced
the executive function of older adults with MCI. Previous studies of
cognitive training in the elderly with MCI did not place sufﬁcient
attention and training on the executive function (20, 23). American
cognitive intervention database on ageing (ACTIVE) summarizes
cognitive intervention studies that have reported positive results
worldwide since 2001 suggested that the optimal training duration
and the dose of cognitive training are 6~10 weeks and 40~75 min
each given 1~2 times per week respectively (48). Therefore, we
adapt to the maximum of the optimal training volume to explore
whether adequate training could improve executive function.
It is crucial to recognize the longevity of training gain and transfer
effects accurately as Sandberg reported (13). Previous study suggests
that the training gains are maintained over 18 months after
completion of executive process training (49). Lustig thought that
cognitive training for short periods followed by reassessments might
be a practical method for maintaining training beneﬁts to minimize
the burden for participants (50). Study about cognitive training on
working memory indicates that the effects of cognitive training on
overall cognitive function and working memory of MCI could be
exerted long-term effects even in the absence of cognitive training
during follow-up (15). Besides, lacking training generalization may
constitute a signiﬁcant obstacle to the effectiveness of cognitive
training (51). The result of Sandberg et al. also stated that
executive process training has the greatest effect on the transfer
tasks (untrained cognitive domains), which have a substantial
process overlap with the trained tasks (49). The older adult exhibit
a similar magnitude of transfer as do the young after process-based
cognitive training (50). However, transfer to the untrained cognitive
domain in the older adults with MCI has been found infrequently
and fewer study have explored the longevity of such effects. In this
training program, we will explore the cognitive training effects, the
longevity of training gain and transfer effects accurately.
There are some hypotheses about the neural correlates of
changed cognition underlying cognitive training, which is far
from conclusive. One hypothesis suggests that if neural overlap
implicates functional overlap, there is a potential for transfer of
training between different cognitive domains (50). As suggested
by Kennedy et al., it is necessary to make a greater understanding
of underlying neural correlate (52), which would provide neural
parameters for assessing the effects of differing cognitive training
on brain health. However, the absence of deﬁnitive neural
parameters makes it challenging to compare the outputs of
different studies. Besides, few cognitive trainings for the elderly
with MCI to date has utilized cognitive neuroscience to direct the
development of process-speciﬁc interventions. We will include
Electroencephalogram along with executive function,
neuropsychological assessment performance, to provide more
evidence for the neural correlates of changed performances
underlying cognitive training.
There are some limitations to the current study. First, the
sample population in this study may not represent the overall

TRIAL STATUS
The study is currently ongoing. Recruitment began in March
2019 and will conclude at the end of 2020.

DATA MANAGEMENT
During the assessment, all the outcome measures will be
recorded by pen and paper. Date collection and informed
consent signed will be conducted in a single room and stored
in a ﬁle cabinet with the password. Only study investigators and
related study assistants will have access to the data for analysis.
The raw data was entered manually by a researcher assistant and
checked independently by two research assistants.

RISK ANALYSIS
None of the published cognitive training trials reviewed was
found adverse effects, and no evidence engaging in these
cognitive activities has a negative effect.
