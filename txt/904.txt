ABSTRACT
We present a significant extension to our work in the
field of Brain-Computer Music Interfacing (BCMI)
through providing brainwave control over a musical score
in real time. This new approach combines measuring
Electroencephalogram (EEG) data elicited via generating
Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP), with
mappings that allow a user to influence a score presented
to a musician in a compositional and/or performance setting.
Mind Trio is a generative BCMI composition based
upon a musical game of 18th century origin. It is designed
to respond to the subjective decisions of a user allowing
them to affect control over elements of notation, ultimately directing parameters that can influence musical dramaturgy and expression via the brain. We present the design
of this piece alongside the practicalities of using such a
system on low-cost and accessible equipment.
Our work further demonstrates how such an approach can be used by multiple users and musicians, and
provides a sound foundation for our upcoming work involving four BCMI subjects and a string quartet.

1. INTRODUCTION
The aim of our research is to develop musical systems
with creative applications for users of all physical abilities. Specifically, we are concerned with the control of
brain signals and the application of this feature for musical performance and composition.
The idea of applying brainwaves to music is not
new. Experimental composers of the 1960’s incorporated
amplified brain signals measured via EEG into their work
after the reported discovery of voluntary alpha wave
(electrical signals of approximately 8-12Hz) control by
Dr Joe Kimaya [1, 2]. The composer Alvin Lucier applied this method of neurofeedback in his 1965 piece
Music for a Solo Performer, and David Rosenboom expanded the field of biofeedback and the arts throughout
the 1970s [3]. Until recently using alpha and other low
frequency rhythms as input to a musical system dominated applications of music performance technologies and
composing with brainwaves [4] [5].

The last decade has brought about strong advances
in the fields of Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI) and
brain signal processing techniques to the extent that computer based musical engines can now be directly controlled via harnessing EEG signals in real-time. Brainwave control of musical parameters has already been researched in [6] [7], and the SSVEP technique we present
here has previously been used in musical applications for
therapeutic and creative purposes [8] [9]. In Sections 4
and 5 of this paper we outline some considerations in our
design for a portable BCMI platform, and introduce a
proof-of-concept composition using SSVEP to affect a
musical score, for presentation to a pianist.

2. BCMI SYSTEMS
BCMI systems vary in regard to the nature of humancomputer interactivity. Computers in user-orientated systems attempt to learn the meaning of the input, a users’
EEG, in an attempt to adapt to its behaviour. These systems are useful when variable or unpredictable brain information exists; variable either by lack of control, individual user differences in response to stimuli or the type
of the input signal being read. For example a time locked
Event Related Potential (ERP) such as a P300 response
may vary across a range of amplitudes per user [10], or a
generative musical system could be designed based on
unpredictable activity across a range of frequency bands.
Early musical systems with EEG input are regarded as
user-orientated systems, such as Richard Teitelbaum’s In
Tune [11] whereby an analogue synthesiser adapts to the
incoming alpha via the EEG, albeit via a human operator.
Computer-orientated systems require a user to adapt to
the functions of the computer; the success of the system
relies on the users’ ability to learn how to perform the
tasks that translate to musical control. Mutuallyorientated systems are a combination of the previous two.
If user control of a system’s input range is achievable then a computer-orientated approach can be deemed
suitable for systems designed with finite control in mind.
The system presented here adopts this computerorientated approach; a user controls the notation through
the pre-determined rules of the computer’s mappings. In
our future work aside from the aforementioned use of
user-orientated systems for interpreting non-meaningful
data recording, incorporating a mutually-orientated approach to measure other unpredictable, but perhaps mean-

ingful information, such as emotional arousal [12] within
EEG may provide further layers of musical expression.
2.1 Musical Applications of BCMI
Musical engines of BCMI systems are designed for either
sonification or musification of EEG data, or for musical
control. Some complexity can be added to systems
through applying a combination of these approaches, depending on the objective. Sonification, the process of
mapping data to sound, is often used in medical BCMI
systems, for example to audibly identify deficiencies or
abnormalities in brain signals; in a way not too dissimilar
to the function of a stethoscope amplifying a heartbeat.
This approach has been used in research into treating
illnesses such as ADHD [13] and epilepsy [14]. Musification of brainwave information is the process of mapping
brain signals to musical parameters and this is often the
case when brain signals are largely uncontrollable and
random in nature. Musical control systems utilise a user’s
cognitive ability to affect control over their brain waves.
This provides a framework for designing BCMI tools that
can respond to the subjective choices of a user, a mental
gesture, so to speak.
2.2 BCMI Components
Our BCMI system is built using the following elements:
• EEG Input – Electrodes placed on the scalp, in
the form of a headband.
• EEG Analysis - Amplification of electrical activity, and data extraction to isolate meaningful information.
• Transformation Algorithm - Mapping EEG information to control parameters within a musical
engine.
• Visual Stimuli – This elicits the EEG data and
provides real-time feedback to the user.
• Musical Engine – This is the musical interpretation of the EEG data, which is presented as a
score to a musician.

Figure 1. The components of the Brain-Computer Music Interfacing system. This diagram illustrates how
EEG data is mapped to a separate computer screen for

displaying the score, and a stimuli display with visual
feedback.

3. SSVEP
Aside from the use of alpha rhythms BCMIs have utilised
other techniques of harnessing brainwave information to
control music. These include stimulating P300 ERPs
[15], auditory imagery [16] and different methods of data
classification [6] [17]. A recent survey of BCI techniques
by the commercial company G.tec has validated SSVEP
as currently the most accurate and responsive method for
BCI user control [18] confirming it to be ideal for realtime control over precise values.
The issue of interpreting meaning in EEG signals for control has long been a focus within BCMI research [7]. The SSVEP technique allows for such precise
control that meaning can be injected into the design of a
system, allowing for simplicity or complexity dependant
on the requirements of the application.
3.1 Eliciting Potentials
ERPs are spikes of brainwave activity produced by perception to stimuli presented to a subject. They are time
locked to the event of the stimuli and as such the ERP
response to a single event is problematic to detect in EEG
on a single trial basis, as it becomes lost in the general
noise of on-going electrical brain activity. However, if a
user is subjected to repeated visual stimulation at short
intervals (at rates approximately between 5Hz – 30Hz),
then before the signal has had a chance to return back to
its unexcited state the rapid introduction of the next flashing onset elicits another response. Further successive
flashes induce what is known as the steady-state response, a continuously evoked amplification of the
brainwave [19]. This negates a need for performing numerous delayed trials as the repeated visuals are consistently providing the stimuli required for a constant potential, translated as a consistent increased amplitude level in
the associated EEG frequency.
This technique, SSEVP, was adopted in a BCMI
system designed for testing with a patient with locked in
syndrome [8] as a tool for providing recreational music
making. Here four flashing icons (between 6 – 15Hz)
were presented on a computer screen, their flashing frequencies relative to the frequencies of corresponding
brainwaves. A user selects an icon by gazing at one and
as a result of this action the amplitude of the corresponding brainwave frequency, measured in the visual cortex,
increases. Here the EEG is analysed continuously, looking for amplitude changes within the four frequencies.
The icons represent four choices, always available to the
user at the same time. These icons are in turn mapped to
commands within a musical engine providing explicit
meaning to each icon. The instantaneous speed of the
EEG response to the stimuli offers real-time control of a
BCMI, which requires no user or system training beyond
the task of visual focusing. When the analysis software
detects an increase in an SSVEP channel a control signal
is feedback to the visual interface providing feedback to
the user.

3.2 Amplitude Control
As well as the selection of commands a second dimension of control was gathered through the level of visual
focusing. This elicited a relative linear response within
the amplitude of the corresponding brain wave. This allows users to employ proportional control methods akin
to intrinsically analogue tasks such as pushing a fader or
turning a dial. This differs from previous selective, more
digital tasks in BCMIs, such as a switch or a toggle function. In previous implementations we utilised this control
to trigger a series of defined notes within a scale [8] and
for more complex mapping techniques [9].
Our SSVEP approach requires the presence of 3
electrodes (using the 10-20 placement system), training
comprising verbal instructions and a calibration time of
approximately 2 minutes per user.

There are two options available for SSVEP stimuli design. Single graphics stimuli have icons that alternate
between a pair of colours (black and white and red and
green being the two pairs most suitable). These flicker
between two alternations per frequency cycle. Pattern
reversal icons with a checkerboard pattern only require
one alternation per cycle, whereby the pattern is reversed
[20]. Icons that use pattern reversal require particular
attention to the spatial frequency of the patterns used, and
this should be optimised for best results with each frequency band. The icons in Figure 2 display different spatial frequencies for different frequency bands; a larger
spatial frequency for faster flashing rates and vice versa
[21].

Figure 2. The visual stimuli screen as presented to a user. Note the differences in spatial frequency of checker
patterns and the feedback ring around the left hand icon
which increases in size and colour intensity relative to
the power of the corresponding EEG frequency.

4. PRACTICALITIES IN BCMI DESIGN
We are keen to take BCMI research out of the laboratory
and into more practical settings. Consequently, for the
system presented here we were keen to use portable laptop computers and EEG systems with wireless electrodes.
Currently high-end medical EEG systems are expensive,
delicate and inefficient to transport and setup. In recent
years headsets aimed at the pro-sumer market from companies such as NeuroSky and Emotiv offer affordable
EEG platforms, but at the expense of accuracy. We have
therefore bypassed more advanced amplitude control,
discussed in Section 3, in favour of a simpler method
using single threshold values where a value rising over a
set threshold acts as a switch. In the system presented
here we have adopted the Emotiv headset with bespoke
signal processing software to drive the JMSL MaxScore
notation platform.
4.1 Visual Interface Considerations
To elicit SSVEP a stable visual interface is required that
updates precisely, without frame drops or variations in
frequency. A good quality graphics card can, by todays
standard, provide the processing required for this, but for
laptop computers (high-end gaming laptops aside) this
can be a struggle.

Figure 3. Diagram displaying the frame combination to
elicit a 12Hz SSVEP response with single graphics
stimuli and pattern reversal.

Calculating the rate of flashes in both cases requires dividing icon onset instances into integers of the screen’s
refresh rate [22]. For example a 12Hz single graphics
stimuli with a 60Hz screen refresh rate would complete
one full cycle (two alternations) every 5 frames, whereas
pattern reversal stimuli would require only one alternation over the same period to elicit SSVEP (see Figure 3).
As shown in Figure 3 there are 50% fewer alternations
required per cycle using the pattern reversal stimuli. This
reduction diminishes the graphics processing required
providing a more stable technique for the laptops we
used.

5. MIND TRIO
Musikalisches Würfelspiel, a music style of German
origin, can be considered as an early form of generative
music that was popularised in 18th Century Europe.
Composing employed a system that used dice to randomly select small sections of pre-composed music resulting
in a piece that would differ upon every iteration. Mozart’s
K6.516f, for instrumental trio, is widely thought to be
derived from this method, and in another work attributed
to him the score’s accompanying commentary begins its
instructions with the line ‘To compose, without the least

knowledge of music, so many [scores] as one pleases…’[23]. We have adapted this idea and twisted our
interpretation to allow for composing with knowledge of
what one is doing to the music.
The BCMI user plays the part of composer in
Mind Trio, arranging the structure of the musical score.
The purpose of our game is to choose from a selection of
musical phrases, which in turn builds the score of the
piece. From user selection via icon gazing a score is arranged then visually updated on a separate computer
screen at regular intervals in time.
Figure 4 illustrates the concept of the compositional game. With the current musical phrase set to 56 the
four icon choices represent the next four possibilities in
the pathway matrix. By selecting the left hand icon
Phrase 73 is selected as the next element in the composition, and the game repeats. With Phrase 73 as the current
Phrase the icons will then switch to represent choices of
phrase 59, 42, 54, 16, and so on.

in the stimuli. EEG data is converted into a control signal
sent to the visual interface displayed to the performer via
the primary laptop. The control signal is sent to a secondary laptop where the transformation algorithm handles
the mappings of the control data to direct the notation,
which is presented for the pianist via the laptop’s display
screen (see Figure 1).
5.2 System Design
For Mind Trio an array of 96 pre-composed musical phrases are allocated sequentially into four pathways in the pathway matrix. During playback the BCMI
user selects a pathway using the associated icon and the
score presented on screen updates to shift to this pathway
at the next display onset time. Here, the musician does
not know what is on the next page until it is automatically
(digitally) turned.
In order for a system with a continuously updating score to function successfully a musician must be
able to read musical segments of at least a few seconds at
once. The display is divided into two lines of two bars,
and with a mean tempo of 60bpm and a 4/4 time signature the page display onset time equates to approximately
8 seconds; thi is adequate for a musician of a professional
standard to work with.
As the mapping of icons to pathways
is relatively straightforward there is little computation
time required, allowing the BCMI user a large window
during each page display during which to make their selection. The piece begins in pathway 1 and during any
window if no selection is made then the current pathway
remains. If a pathway reaches the end of its 24 phrases it
simply continues in a circular style from the beginning.
It is worth noting that in more complex mapping
systems the selection window may need to be shortened
to account for algorithmic processing as well as account
for multiple selections over a range of parameters. Also a
more complex score is likely to coincide with less accuracy from a musician. This is also owing to the fact that
there is no possibility to rehearse an exact piece, as each
composition will differ from the last.

Figure 4. The compositional strategy for playing Mind
Trio shows how to build a continuous score from Phrase
56 to Phrase 73. Note that the diagram shows only an
excerpt of the pathway matrix.

5.1 System Design
Mind Trio is a musical piece designed for BCMI user and
solo pianist. The BCMI user, wearing a wireless headset,
sends EEG data to a primary laptop. Signal processing
software analyses the incoming EEG data stream assessing relevant SSVEP activity using Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) analysis of frequency bandwidths held

which, seconds later, updates the score on the right hand
screen.

6. MULTIPLE BCMI USERS
We have successfully trialled a version of our system
with multiple users controlling musical parameters of
pre-composed music. Figure 6 below shows two subjects
affecting elements of the same electronic composition as
a way of composing together, expanding the concept of
neurofeedback. Here, feedback not only exists in single
loops between subjects and computers as the paths of
neurofeedback loops change as they influence and combine with other subjects at different times. The musical
outcomes of this setting pose an exciting playground for
experimentation and creative music making. Our aim is
to integrate this collaborative approach into our notation
system whereby four BCMI users control micro, meso,
and macro features of a score for a string quartet. We
hope to have this system ready for performance by early
2014.

electrical signals (as low as only a few microvolts) that
are filtered through the skull, membrane, hair and skin
results in significant noise levels alongside interference
from other electrical sources and the continual electrical
activity of non-related EEG. Although SSVEP provides
relative high accuracy extracting meaning within EEG
signals still requires complex signal analysis tools and is
also largely reflected in the quality of the hardware components.
Mind Trio presents a simple proof-of-concept system that
paves the way for more advanced compositional techniques and mapping strategies using digital notation presented to musicians. By injecting more complex meaning
within the design of such systems, higher levels of musical complexity can be offered and subsequently controlled. For example, a well as directing structural pathways, more expressive parameters and nuances such as
harmonic structure, playing technique or dynamic and
rhythmic changes, can be chosen via the BCMI. This
expansion, coupled with multiple users poses an exciting
platform for creative composition and BCMI design.

7. DISCUSSION
Our research successfully demonstrates the suitability of
the SSVEP technique for eliciting control over musical
notation in the continuous fashion required for acoustic
music performance. Furthermore our system highlights
that SSVEP control is achievable using portable and affordable equipment that is subsequently more practical
for use in real-world environments; it requires minimal
calibration, apparatus and setup time. By harnessing brain
signals in this manner the neurofeedback loop that is created between the BCMI user and the resulting music is
extended to include a musician. This is a significant step
in the design of new BCMI tools. We have demonstrated
how SSVEP interfaces can be designed for consumer
level laptop computers, widening access to the technologies required for BCMI, as well as for users with limited
motor capabilities.
It is important to note, however, there are still key issues
that plague the stability of composing with brainwaves,
which affect the usability and accuracy of measuring
brain signals with this technology, more significantly
than high-end medical systems and outside of the controlled environment of the laboratory.
