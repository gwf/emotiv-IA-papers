3 Measuring Presence in the Simulating Brain
Daniel Sjölie
Abstract: A description of the brain as an organ for simulating its environment
can inform and illuminate a discussion about brain measurements in connection
with the sense of presence. Developing theories of how mental simulations and
continuous predictions underlie brain function have implications for how presence
can, or cannot, be associated with brain measurements. Here, the simulating brain
is accepted as a working hypothesis. The resulting implications are discussed and
briefly related to how brain measurements have been used to investigate presence in
previous studies.
Keywords: Presence; Brain Measurements; The Simulating Brain; fMRI; Predictions.

3.1 Introduction to Chapter 3
The subjective nature of the sense of presence makes it difficult to relate it to objective
measurements. One tempting possibility is to target the neural functions underlying
subjective experiences by measuring brain activity using methods such as fMRI
(functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging). The technology and expertise necessary
for using such methods has become relatively common over the last decade, and a few
studies have been conducted to measure what happens in the brain in connection to a
varying sense of presence. However, how such measurements should be interpreted,
and how they should be related back to presence in theory and practice, remains an
open question. For example, explanations that focus on specific brain areas are not
conclusive since most areas of the brain have been shown to be involved in many
different cognitive functions and brain function is heavily influenced by context.

3.2 Background
The range of methods used to measure presence has evolved over the years, from
pure subjective measures using questionnaires, to more objective measures based
on behaviour or physiology (Insko, 2003) and, more recently, including brain
measurements (Baumgartner et al., 2008; Clemente, Rodríguez, Rey, & Alcañiz, 2012;
Kober & Neuper, 2012). Interested readers are encouraged to look up the references
above, for a more complete overview of the background of presence measurements.
The rest of this chapter focuses on how brain measurements might be used to measure
presence (and associated challenges) based on a theoretical perspective on the brain
summarized as “the simulating brain”.

The Simulating Brain

There are many different definitions of presence that may be related to brain
function with varying ease. Several definitions relate directly to subjective experiences
that are essentially hidden. Two common definitions of presence, as the “sense of
being there” or as the “perceptual illusion of non-mediation” (Insko, 2003), both
come down to what is actually sensed or perceived “inside of the users mind.” That
is, to how percepts (sensory input) and information flows through and is processed
in the user’s brain.
The relation between brain function and definitions such as the ability to “do
there” (successful intentional interaction) or responding to stimuli from a virtual
environment (VE) “as if they were real” may be less obvious, but the connection has
been established explicitly and repeatedly (Jäncke, Cheetham, & Baumgartner, 2009;
Sanchez-Vives & Slater, 2005).
This chapter aims to avoid an explicit definition of presence (see Chapters 1 and
2 for a wider discussion about this topic), but important aspects of presence in the
simulating brain are summarized in Section 4.

3.3 The Simulating Brain
The idea that the brain is essentially about predicting the future is becoming
increasingly popular (Clark, 2013; Friston, 2009b, 2010; Hawkins, 2005; Schacter,
Addis, & Buckner, 2007). The basic function of the brain is, it is suggested, to use
information from the past to make predictions about what is likely to happen in the
future. The concept of mental simulations is helpful to focus on these predictions as
running, continuously updating expectations. In much the same way as remembering
the past seems to involve “a constructive process of piecing together bits and pieces”
(Schacter et al., 2007, p. 659), partial simulations based on previous experience are
continuously pieced together to simulate future states and guide action.
Partial simulations are stored in brain areas related to the corresponding
modalities, providing a basis for higher-level aspects of simulations. For example,
the higher-level concept of “colour” is related to simulations of seeing colour, stored
in the areas of the brain related to the actual perception of colour; and the concept
of “up” is related to simulations of looking up, stored in motor areas. Cognition is
further described as having a hierarchical structure where concepts and phenomena
at higher levels are grounded in lower levels. High-level predictions correspond to
contexts for low-level predictions. For example, a high-level expectation of walking
on a flat surface triggers lower-level predictions of your foot hitting the ground at a
certain moment. Higher-level contexts only need to change when predictions fail at
lower levels, highlighting the importance of prediction errors and feedback in the
brain. As long as the foot hits the ground as predicted one does not need to reconsider
the walking context. Simulations pieced together throughout a hierarchy, based

48

Measuring Presence in the Simulating Brain

on current percepts (bottom-up) and current context (top-down), enable efficient
interaction by continually preparing for what is likely to happen next.
Particularly interesting for this chapter is how this framework suggests that the
brain essentially contains a model of reality, and that brain activity in large part
corresponds to experiences that are unexpected or surprising; that is, experiences
that were not correctly predicted. Poor predictions can be caused either by an
incomplete knowledge of the phenomenon, or by fundamental unpredictability. If the
stimuli are fundamentally predictable however, the brain is excellent at detecting and
adapting to these stimuli, integrating them into mental simulations and expectations.
This effect can be recognized in many well-known phenomena, such as repetition
suppression, habituation, and odd-ball paradigms, commonly employed as reliable
effects in cognitive neuroscience studies.
The proponents of these theories are not shy about their potential. Karl Friston
writes that “one can see easily how constructs like memory, attention, value,
reinforcement and salience might disclose their simple relationships within this
framework” (Friston, 2009b, p. 293), and in a somewhat more nuanced target paper
Andy Clark writes that “what is on offer is a multilevel account of some of the deepest
natural principles underlying learning and inference, and one that may be capable
of bringing perception, action, and attention under a single umbrella” (Clark, 2013,
p. 20).
It may be illustrative to reflect on why humans perceive some things as more
“real” than others. To quote Hawkins, “predictability is the very definition of reality”
(Hawkins, 2005, p. 128). Consider the opposite of reality: the unreal. If something is
unreal it means that it does not fit into one’s current understanding of the world, it
is inconsistent with the patterns one has learned to recognize, and there is no basis
for making predictions about this phenomenon, or running matching simulations.
Depending upon how large the deviation from the familiar is, this may lead to
confusion, and/or adaptation of the models for what is familiar: that is, learning.
Many aspects of the theories presented above are still debated. Including enough
arguments to convince sceptics is outside the scope of this chapter. For an introduction
to the discussion surrounding these theories the recent target paper by Andy Clark is
recommended (Clark, 2013).

3.4 Presence in the Simulating Brain
The simulating brain suggests possible explanations of phenomena generally
associated with presence. The basic reasoning is based on a view of the human brain
as continually running a simulation of the surrounding environment, trying to match
and anticipate the future as well as possible. Such simulations have reached the brain
through experience with reality, through prediction errors that force refinements of the
dynamic models. The (hypothesized) fact that these mental simulations originate in



Presence in the Simulating Brain

49

(interaction with) the real environment leads to an expectation of similarities between
actual reality and the simulation in the brain, both in behaviour and in structure. When
the world the brain currently inhabits is a computer-generated virtual reality, this
perspective constitutes the foundation for an interpretation of brain function and brain
measurements as tightly related to phenomena in and aspects of this virtual reality.
Within the simulating brain, information that reaches any higher levels of the
brain is related to internal expectations of the brain to an extremely high degree,
rather than being anything like direct information from the external environment.
One way to think of such expectations is as mental simulations that together create a
subjective mental reality. This subjective mental reality may be more or less influenced
by the current external environment, but it does run on its own, as “a generative
model of the world it inhabits” (Friston, 2010, p. 135), to a large degree. Since most
areas of the brain primarily operate in relation to the rest of the brain, it is reasonable
to say that the brain is present in the subjective mental reality that is simulated in the
brain. Within this perspective, the degree of presence in a certain environment may
be considered to be the degree of synchronization between this environment and your
(simulated) subjective mental reality (Sjölie, 2012). In an office: to what degrees are
you currently simulating surrounding desks, chairs, pens, etc.?
One implication of this perspective on presence is that brain activity associated
with a high level of presence should depend strongly on the specifics of the current
environment and task. Conversely, a low level of presence should be related to
a mismatch between the actual brain activity and the brain activity required to
simulate the environment. If being present in an environment means that your brain
is simulating aspects of that environment, then your brain activity should reflect this,
and being present in different environments should lead to corresponding differences
in the patterns of brain activity. In the case of reduced or disrupted presence in
relation to a specific environment, the “alternate environment,” representing reduced
presence, may be another actual environment, a state of general confusion, or some
form of daydreaming.
The simulating brain may be easily related to many previous accounts of presence,
such as the importance of avoiding “breaks in presence” (Slater, 2002), the ability to use
familiar representations to “do there” (Jäncke et al., 2009), the successful transformation
of intentions into actions, or the perceptual illusion of non-mediation (Giuseppe Riva,
Waterworth, Waterworth, & Mantovani, 2011). For example, breaks in presence (BIPs)
correspond to events that destroy the sense of presence through events that go against
the expectations that underlie the acceptance of a VE as real, such as hearing a chair
move in a forest VE. In relation to the simulating brain, BIPs are prediction errors that
are big enough to rise through the hierarchy of predictions and finally invalidate the
prediction that one is in a context that can be treated as a real place.
The importance of expectations and their violation for achieving and maintaining
presence has been explicitly emphasized several times, for example, in terms of
simulations in the brain (Giuseppe Riva et al., 2011; Sjölie, 2012), or the importance of

50

Measuring Presence in the Simulating Brain

being able to rely on expectations and existing motor schemas to be able to “do there”
(Jäncke et al., 2009; Sanchez-Vives & Slater, 2005).
Two key aspects of the conception of presence presented above are:
1. Presence is a general function of cognition, related to your familiarity with and
attention to your current environment. It is not specifically related to immersive
VR, although VR provides unique opportunities to manipulate and explore all
aspects of presence.
2. The brain activity related to presence, and differences in the level of presence,
in any specific environment, is tightly related to the actual environment and the
current task.
These points should primarily be understood as a delimitation of the conception of
presence discussed here, rather than a claim on what presence should be generally.

3.5 Measuring What, How?
The rest of this chapter delves into what one can expect to be able to measure when
it comes to presence in the simulating brain. How may measurements be gathered,
and how might previous results be integrated? The present section focuses on
methodological issues and theoretical background, while the next section delves into
previous studies.
Ensuring reliability and validity when estimating presence using brain
measurements can be challenging. The primary problem for validity is that there is
no obvious or generally agreed upon ground truth to compare measurements against.
According to common conceptions of presence, the ideal would be to be able to ask the
user a question like “where are you?” while they are immersed and engaged within a
VE. In general, this is not possible without disrupting the very experience (of presence)
that we wish to measure, although some studies suggest that this disruption may be
manageable (Kober & Neuper, 2012). Behavioural and physiological measurements
are interesting alternatives that may be recorded during VR interaction (Insko, 2003).
Such measurements are related to presence indirectly, for example, by assuming that
increased arousal corresponds to increased presence. However, such assumptions
are debatable and any practical measure quickly becomes very dependent on specific
conceptions of presence. Questionnaires may focus on factors assumed to be related
to the sense of presence, such as the sense of control, or variations of whether the
environment is experienced as a place (Insko, 2003). Given how tightly measurements
are tied to theory in general, new potential measurements should be considered
based on whether they are theoretically defendable, rather than on compatibility
with previous measures of presence.
The complexity and context sensitivity of human brain function provide challenges
to both reliability and validity. Brain measurements are often presented in terms of



Measuring What, How?

51

which areas of the brain “light up.” This is particularly common in fMRI studies, where
the most common data analysis looks at each point in the brain separately, checking
whether the local “activity” is significantly different between some conditions.
Interpretation of such activations is usually related to what previous research
tells us about the functional role of specific brain areas (functional segregation)
(Friston, 2009a). However, such interpretations must be tempered by the fact that
activation in any specific brain area can be caused by many different combinations
of excitation and inhibition from other brain areas, essentially representing different
contexts (Jäncke et al., 2009; Logothetis, 2008). These issues are well known in the
brain imaging community in general, but addressing these issues fully requires
sophisticated studies that are still relatively rare, and reporting in the popular press
is often flawed. The basic message to readers not familiar with brain imaging is: avoid
interpretations on the form “the function X is located at position Y in the brain”. Brain
areas do tend to play specific roles and data about brain area activations is valuable,
but interpretations need to acknowledge the importance of context.
Unravelling how local brain activity depends on interactions with the rest of the
brain usually requires additional analysis. One approach is to investigate connectivity
between specific brain areas explicitly (Baumgartner et al., 2008). Another increasingly
popular approach is to compare measured brain activity with models, with explicit
expectations (Friston, 2009a). Theoretical frameworks such as the simulating brain
provide a valuable basis and starting point for the construction of such models for
presence in the brain.
If we accept the simulating brain as a working hypothesis: can we expect some
areas of the brain to always be associated with increased presence? As suggested
above, in a perfect VE, with perfect presence, presence-related brain activity should
be dictated by the particular task and context. However, no such perfect environment
exists today, and it is debatable if presence is ever perfect for any length of time. Thus,
we are primarily dealing with degrees of imperfect presence.
Brain measurements related to imperfect presence should be related to aspects of
the current environment and task that fail to synchronize properly with the simulated
subjective mental reality. In particular, brain areas that correspond to a (higher-level)
context or (lower-level) detail predictions related to a problematic phenomenon can
be expected to be activated in an attempt to resolve the prediction error. For example,
a troublesome virtual fork may trigger re-evaluation of both lower-level “physical fork
handling” simulations and higher-level “eating with a fork” simulations.
Keeping in mind how brain areas correspond to aspects of simulations within a
hierarchy may be helpful to get an initial sense of how measured local brain activity
fits into the larger context and affects the total sense of presence. For example,
significant disruptions in presence should correspond to large prediction errors that
rise through the hierarchy, leading to increased activity in more frontal brain regions.
Also, brain areas that are consistently implicated in relation to varying presence
should be interpreted as corresponding to aspects of the simulated mental reality

52

Measuring Presence in the Simulating Brain

that are particularly important for the creation and maintenance of a general sense
of presence.
One common approach is to compare brain measurements related to different
conditions designed to elicit varying levels of presence. Subjective reports of presence
may be used to verify a significant difference in reported presence between conditions
(Baumgartner et al., 2008; Clemente et al., 2012), but variability in how subjects report
presence and biases like the recency effect are an issue, in particular since brain imaging
studies often have a relatively small number of subjects. Asserting that measured
responses are related to changes in subjective presence more generally, rather than
related to specifics of the employed conditions, is also a primary challenge.
The latter problem may be addressed either with variability in the conditions,
leaving differences in presence as the primary explanatory variable, or by trying
to keep the conditions as similar as possible and still elicit different sensations of
presence. Bouchard et al. (2012) demonstrated the second approach by using different
narratives to produce differences in presence while keeping the VE itself constant
across conditions. Such methods provide a level of confidence that measured activity
is related to differences in presence, but it is still unclear how the results depend on
particulars of the context.
Another approach is to focus on what happens when presence changes. That is,
focusing more on transitory events or short time periods where the sense of presence
changes. The great challenge here is that it is difficult to get reliable information
on the subjective experience of presence over time without seriously impacting the
experience we want to investigate. As remarked above, if we were to ask the subject
about their degree of presence at regular intervals this would be very likely to affect
their sense of presence. One may design the experiment to introduce events that are
expected to lead to differences in experienced presence, for example, by violating
expectations and (potentially) triggering BIPs. However, this approach has the same
vulnerabilities as the comparison of conditions above, potentially drowning effects of
changing presence in effects related to particulars of the designed events.
An alternative to using designed changes to affect presence is to try to piece
together when subjects experienced changes in presence through some combination
of behavioural data and post-scan reports. Spiers and Maguire have used such a setup
in several studies, for example, to investigate the neural correlates of spontaneous
mentalizing (Spiers & Maguire, 2006).

3.6 Previous Studies
There are many brain imaging studies with results that can be related to presence, but
only a small number that investigate presence explicitly. This chapter cannot begin to
give a complete review of relevant studies, but the selection below should provide an
introduction to the kind of studies conducted.



Previous Studies

53

VR and brain imaging have been used together in a number of studies over the last
decades. A recent review by Maguire (2012) provides a general overview of research
using a combination of VR and fMRI (VRfMRI). Early VRfMRI studies by Hoffman et al.
(2003) and Lee et al. (2004) include a discussion of presence, but neither present any
brain measurements directly related to presence.
Baumgartner et al. (2008) conducted the most comprehensive fMRI study on
presence to date. Their study is based on the comparison of two conditions designed
to elicit high and low presence, respectively. Both conditions were presented as
non-interactive roller-coaster rides in a 3d-environment, with a flat track in the lowpresence condition and spectacular slopes and loops in the high-presence condition.
Post-scan questionnaires were used to relate differences in reported presence to
differences in brain activation, across subjects. Restricting initial analysis to the
prefrontal cortex based on an a priori hypothesis, activity in bilateral dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, a “high-level control” area) was reported as negatively
correlated with the sense of presence. Subjects who reported a smaller increase in
presence between conditions showed a greater BOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent)
increase in DLPFC. Using connectivity analysis, DLPFC activity was further related to
down-regulation of the egocentric dorsal visual processing stream (including parietal
areas) and up-regulation of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC).
The results from the study by Baumgartner et al. are further discussed in a paper
by Jäncke et al. (2009). Among other things, it is acknowledged that the identified
network of brain areas is not exclusively related to modulation of presence, since
the areas in question are involved in many other psychological functions. However,
the DLPFC is suggested to play a central role in regulating (among other things)
the sense of presence, as it serves as an “executive control”. The simulating brain
suggests an essentially compatible but conceptually different explanation. The DLPFC
corresponds to a higher position in the hierarchy of simulations and predictions in
the brain. From a bottom-up perspective any failure of lower-level predictions, such
as internalized simulations of spatial interaction, is expected to give rise to prediction
errors that must be dealt with further up, for example, in the DLPFC. From a topdown perspective, when a situation is familiar and simulations are synchronized with
external phenomena, predictions can be pushed down through the hierarchy relatively
effortlessly. In essence, lower-level areas can successfully run simulations based on
(among other things) predictions from DLPFC and need not bother the DLPFC further.
An association between reduced activity in DLPFC and increased presence fits well
with both these perspectives.
An interesting alternative to the comparison of different environments has been
presented by Bouchard et al. (2012). Their study used narratives to convince some
subjects that an immersive VE was real, while others were immersed in the same VE
without believing that it was real. Believing that the VE was real was correlated with
an increased sense of presence and increased activation in bilateral parahippocampal
cortex.

54

Measuring Presence in the Simulating Brain

As remarked above, if presence requires a close match between simulations in the
brain and phenomena in the interaction environment, brain measurements related to
varying presence should be related to important aspects of the environment and task
in question. Indeed, in the study by Baumgartner et al. (2008) increased presence
while riding a roller-coaster was related to visual and spatial brain regions. Similarly,
in the study by Bouchard, increased presence related to believing oneself to be in a
real room was related to activations in parahippocampal cortex, a brain region known
to be involved in spatial/location processing.
It should be noted that none of the studies above allowed the user to interact
with the environment. A recent study by Clemente et al. (2013) compares conditions
in a manner similar to Baumgartner et al., but also includes an interactive condition.
While this study has a lower number of subjects, making it somewhat harder to
interpret with confidence, the primary findings are in line with Baumgartner et al.
and other brain imaging studies comparing similar conditions, implicating DLPFC
and spatial brain regions, among others.
fMRI may be the brain imaging method with the greatest promise for understanding
brain measurements related to presence generally, but other methods may be more
suitable for practical measurements. For example, EEG (electroencephalography) can
be much cheaper and easier to use, with far fewer restrictions on possible interactions
and scenarios. In one recent study, Kober et al. used EEG to compare a highly immersive
VR-system with a less immersive VR-system (Kober, Kurzmann, & Neuper, 2012). Both
conditions were interactive, differing primarily in visual field and use of stereoscopy.
A comparison across subjects, with different groups for each condition, showed that
an increased sense of presence in the highly immersive condition was accompanied
by EEG measures signifying increased parietal activation, particularly compared to
frontal brain areas. These results seem to agree with Baumgartner et al. in implicating
parietal and frontal areas in the modulation of presence. It is interesting that the
difference between the conditions is relatively small in this study, but given the poor
spatial resolution of EEG some caution may be prudent. Additional studies conducted
using commercially available and affordable EEG headset (Emotiv EPOC) (Clemente
et al., 2012), or transcranial Doppler (TCD) (Rey, Parkhutik, Tembl, & Alcañiz, 2011)
exemplify additional work towards practical brain measurements.
Kober and Neuper illustrate the conceptual overlap between behavioural,
physiological and brain measurements in a recent study using EEG to measure brain
activity triggered by sounds not related to VR (Kober & Neuper, 2012). The response
to the external sounds was measured and related to reports of experienced presence.
In principle, this type of response could have been detectable with behavioural or
physiological measurements, but by using EEG one may be able to detect smaller,
hidden, responses, making it possible to use less intrusive triggers (the sounds) and
reduce unwanted impact on presence.

3.7 Conclusion to Chapter 3
As with brain imaging in general, “the conceptual challenge ahead may not lie in
finessing the techniques at our disposal but informing the models used to explain
data” (Friston, 2009a, p. 402). A theoretical understanding of presence in the
simulating brain suggests rich explanations that provide a basis for the construction
of such models. Previous studies relating brain measurements to the sense of presence
provide valuable data for the initial comparison of models as well as for the continued
generation of models and hypotheses.
While results based on comparisons of different environments may be influenced
by the particular contexts, they provide important pieces to the puzzle. To improve
the general understanding of the relation between brain measurements and the
sense of presence, additional research investigating a varied set of environments and
contexts would be very valuable. Moreover, established associations to brain activity,
for example, in the DLPFC and parietal regions, may be further evaluated in relation
to practical measurements in contexts and environments matching the corresponding
studies. In either case the perspective provided by the simulating brain may be helpful
in teasing out and explaining how differences in environments and contexts may
impact presence and its neural correlates.
