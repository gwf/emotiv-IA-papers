THE EFFECTIVENESS OF APPLYING
STORYTELLING IN ADVERTISING
SPOTS
Abstract: The present paper aims to determine the
effectiveness of applying storytelling in advertising. The
target audience was made up by young people in the city of
Cuenca from 18 to 35 years of age. The research was divided
into two stages which combined quantitative, qualitative and
experimental research. In the first stage we analyzed variables
such as brand awareness and people’s attitude towards the
message by means of surveys; participant observation was
used in the second stage in order to learn about people’s
reactions to a spot. Finally, through experimentation and the
use of the Emotiv Epoc tool, we measured the neuronal
activity of different parts of the brain.
The results showed that advertising is effective when it
includes a story, it awakens consumer interest and causes
their attention, intensity of their memory and brand
recognition to increase compared to spots that do not use this
technique.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, technology has encouraged the
creation of a number of means of
communication which have enabled people
to increasingly be more connected and
overcome distance barriers. However,
television is still considered the main source
of information, entertainment and credibility
with long term effects. Accordingly, as a
result of this evolution, companies have also
developed new techniques for their
advertising so as to capture people’s
attention as well as increase brand awareness
and brand positioning.
The aim of constantly innovating techniques
to develop advertising is to have greater
effectiveness, therefore companies have
found mechanisms to evaluate them
beforehand. Currently, one of the techniques

that is used the most is storytelling, better
known as “the art of telling stories”.
At present, one of the new tendencies that
has strongly emerged in the world of
marketing and advertising is storytelling.
This new way of understanding the evolution
of content marketing refers to how we can
use stories to generate emotions in the target
audience. It does not matter if the stories are
fiction or real, as long as they are capable of
emotionally connecting with the audience. A
television story is made up by a history of
events or actions which have created new
guidelines for marketing communication.
In this regard, research has been carried out
on consumer behavior and the cognitive
processes that individuals have when
watching a television message, for this
purpose neuroscience has provided multiple

consumers’ reactions to the stimuli applied
in the field of marketing. A mixed
methodology which consisted of two stages
was applied; structured surveys based on the
Alternative Evaluation Model in Advertising
suggested by (Phillips 2004) were applied in
the first part. In the second part, both a
structured observation and experimentation
with the Emotiv Epoc device were carried
out,

stimulation.
The results demonstrate the influence of the
storytelling technique in advertising spots
when presented to audiences.

2. Theoretical background
2.1. Advertising in national means of
communication
Nowadays, advertising is a strategic element
to communicate goods, services and ideas,
where the message being transmitted carries
a continuous process of influence that
arouses interest in the receiver, since the
advertisement is a mediating activity
between the material world (product, brand)
and the universe of consumption (consumer).
Advertising is the essential agent of public
space, it is part of the customs and furnishing
of society, it provides patterns of knowledge
of each era, it is a mirror of society that
shows how people lived and aspired to live;
advertising is considered an instrument of
communication of the economic and cultural
system. The messages used in advertising are
persuasive and constitute the vision, reality
and representations of daily life (López
2014).
The advertising industry has grown rapidly,
at present its vivacity allows it to be the
support of means of communication.
Television is one of them, its reach
encourages companies and brands to invest

946

large amounts of money in advertising. In
Ecuador, the use of advertising began in
1968, when the Ecuadorian Association of
Advertising Agencies (AEAP for its
acronym in Spanish) was created in order to
professionalize and create norms that
regulate advertising activities in the most
basic aspects, as well as to generate solid
relationships with the media that benefit
consumers. However, in spite of the
regulations created by the AEAP, in 1998
the Ecuadorian Constitution established the
prohibition of misleading and abusive
advertising; and in 2000, the most stringent
Consumer Protection Organic Law was
issued (Muñoz 2015).
Advertising in the national context has had a
strong impact mainly due to the application
of the Organic Law of Communication
(LOC for its acronym in Spanish) in 2013,
whose main objective has been to guarantee
access to the exercise of communication in
the country. The Law seeks to improve and
promote the advertising activity, therefore,
the articles of major importance for the
purpose of this research refer to the fact that
80% of the advertising must be done
nationally and 20% abroad; it must not
exceed 15 minutes per hour of programming
with advertising spots of maximum 30
seconds each on television.
According to (Sánchez, Yánez and Martinez
2017) advertising agencies, creative areas
and television channels have stated that this
facilitates their work and encourages the
development of national production, it also
provides information on the permanent
monitoring of means of communication in
order to control advertising overload. In
response to this issue, companies and their
products believe one of its strategic points is
to develop a media plan in order to increase
communication (Paladines, Valarezo and
Yaguache 2013).
Means of communication present spots or
commercial advertisements developed by
advertising, which according to (Kim, et al.,
2017) aim to connect the viewer with the

A. Vallejo, S. Efstathios, M. Guaman, M. Banegas, A. Narvaez

product through experiential transfer and
face-to-face duration. The study carried out
by (Sayedi, Jerath and Srinivasan 2014)
indicates that companies budget for the use
of traditional channels such as television,
with the aim of creating product awareness
and captivating customers. It is also
necessary to consider the approach given by
(Danaher and Rossiter 2011) for whom
traditional channels such as television retain
historical attributes such as reliability which
is preferred by recipients in terms of
marketing communications. Within the same
line (Teixeira, Wedel and Pieters 2010) state
that, the activity of each brand has a certain
degree of importance in the level of retention
of the spots presented to viewers. If a brand
is presented during sustained periods, there
is a high probability that this particular
commercial will be avoided by viewers.
These actions of TV channel migration, also
known as zapping, can be minimized by
changing the pattern in which a brand is
exposed on television.
2.2. Storytelling as an adversating
strategy
Companies have used discourse as a tool in
order to increase the levels of audiences, this
strategy uses a sequence of inter related
scenes that manages to create an emotional
link with the public. This sequence of
scenes, better known as “stories”, has meant
success for brands, products and even
presidential elections, according to (GuptaCarlson 2016) countries like the USA and
France have used this advertising approach
since the beginning of the 19th century when
they told stories of the lives of presidential
candidates.
As of the twentieth century, (Richard 2013)
says that for the transmission of presidential
campaigns in mass media, they began to use
multimedia narratives and later on social
networks combined several elements of
sensory
stimulation
to
generate
remembrance. In this case, it is necessary to

highlight that according to (Sibierska 2017)
stories are not necessarily told verbally,
narration is not limited to the use of
language, it is possible to tell testimonies
without the use of words; these stories are
usually accompanied by facial expressions,
images and movements.
Storytelling appeared as an evolution of
narratives, for (Ravena and Elahi 2015) it is
the fusion of the plot (scheme or plan of the
story) which acts as a route map and the
narration, which is considered the trajectory,
where a story follows a sequence of events
in time and space. In this regard, (Shen,
Lieberman and Davenport 2009) believe that
in the world of storytelling the human
capacity to narrate stands out, this has a
parallel relationship with language by
associating descriptions of stories and human
scenes, where they describe characters,
emotions and different sequential topics of
an event. According to the abovementioned
information, storytelling refers to the most
common way of communication, in other
words (Woodside, Sood and Miller 2008)
say it is narrating stories, which is present in
all stages of life, since for years people
accumulate, use and transmit information in
the form of events, this pattern of
dissemination, according to (Gilliama and
Flaherty 2015), (Bowman et al., 2013) and
(Marshall and Adamic 2010) seeks to
persuade, link or transmit messages, in order
to create simple connections in a creative
context that is essential to establish a
meaning and emotional connection, since it
is a fundamental part of human cognition.
(Denning 2006) and (Kumar and Gupta
2016) state that at the moment of
incorporating narration and advertising in the
businesses, it is necessary to keep in mind
that this is a tool with commercial ends,
which seeks to accomplish a business’
purpose, with strategies based on current
trends, selection of media and market.
However, consumers opt for smart shopping,
they are updated and trained on products and
brands.

947

Additionally, authors such as (O'Connor
2002), (Delgado-Ballester and FernándezSabiote 2016) and (Herskovitz and Crystal
2010) state that narrative has grown in
several sectors to build corporate brands by
combining and developing stories associated
with elements as authenticity, conciseness,
investment and humor, and when merging
with advertising it should consider the
aesthetic value and transport the consumer to
an alternative environment through emotions
with creative memories. Narratives have
developed alongside advertising to become a
way to reach consumers, this new way of
telling stories has spread across multiple
communication platforms that promote the
connection between the narrator and the
audience (Stackelberg and Jones 2014).
Nowadays consumer behavior has been
influenced by the technique of storytelling
when creating emotional bonds, in this
context, (Peracchio and Escalas 2008) and
(Escalas 2004) say that an advertisement
with the use of narrative generates
connections and positive relationships
towards the brand and influences the
attitudes of the user. From the point of view
of (Lien and Chen 2013) and (Chang 2008),
narrative advertising conveys the central
message through a story, which influences
the ability to process information and show
experiential immersions, causing sympathy
and attraction to the observer.
Once these concepts have been presented,
the authors coincidence with (Peracchio and
Scales 2008) on the fact that narratives
generate connections and directly affect the
habits of consumers without neglecting the
interpretative critical reflection, because this
involves hooking a client and then by means
of the storytelling technique make them
reflect on the information and advertising
insights implicit in an advertising spot.
2.3. Neuromarketing as tool to measure
the effectiveness of advertising

948

Considering that neuroscience represents
quite a recent fusion between different
disciplines such as neurology, cognitive
neuropsychology and cognitive sciences
(Braidot 2006); marketing’s field of research
has benefited from the advancement of the
aforementioned areas, therefore in recent
years advertising agencies have been forced
to further deepen their work with the use of
new alternatives such as Neuromarketing, an
area of applied neuroscience, capable of
analyzing brain responses to certain stimuli
with the use of tools to track the main
neurophysiological signals and consumer
behavior in relation to markets and
commercialization exchanges (Babiloni
2015).
There are several tools used in
neuromarketing to investigate the reactions
of consumers by studying the response of
their brain rather than what is verbally
expressed: functional magnetic resonance
imaging (FMRI), PET tomography (positron
emission tomography); encephalography
(EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG)
that measure electrical changes in the brain.
At the same time, other research systems
have been developed using different
technologies, for instance Eye Tracking and
Mynd,
where
electroencephalographic
sensors of the same quality as a medical
device are available, which can be connected
to mobile devices by means of bluetooth to
enable communication and interpretation of
data in real time (Misiego 2013, p 143-144).
Neuromarketing has provided several
mechanisms to study consumers; they point
to the physical and chemical properties of
neurons individually. However, at the same
time there has been research in cognitive
neuroscience; this branch seeks to perceive
the neural processes underlying complex
thoughts, such as reasoning, decision
making, objective representation, emotion or
memory, which is completed with marketing
concepts, such as positioning, hierarchy of
effects, brand loyalty or consumer responses
(Salazar 2011).

A. Vallejo, S. Efstathios, M. Guaman, M. Banegas, A. Narvaez

Consumer behavior reflects all the
dispositions about the consumption of an
offer by making decisions at a certain time;
the main areas of study are: the culture, the
psychological core, the decision-making
process and the results inherent to the
behavior of the individual, these four factors
affect the motivation, capacity and
opportunity of the consumer to process
information, make decisions or initiate
action (Hoyer, MacInnis and Pieters 2015, p
2-14). These components according to the
decision-making model of (Schiffman and
Wisenblit 2015, p 55) have an external input
or influence, such as the marketing efforts of
the company and the socio-cultural
environment; followed by the decisionmaking process, influenced by the
psychological field that affects the
recognition of the need, search before the
purchase and evaluation of alternatives; as
output there is the behavior subsequent to the
purchase decision and evaluation.
2.4. Emotiv Epoc, as a Neuromarketing
tool
Neuroscientific studies in the field of
marketing seek to understand consumer
behavior, thus (Fugate 2007) states that with
the help of brain imaging techniques it is
possible to evidence and document risk
taking, consumer satisfaction, brand loyalty,
personality traits, basic hypotheses of the
role of trust from different standards of
marketing
literature.
As
technology
advances, it provides more tools to search
for information about the neuronal activity
of consumers, who when exposed to product
advertisements, the use of neuroscience tools
such as EGG or Emotiv Epoc make it
possible to know the behavior of areas of the
brain, allowing the interpretation of
emotions, which are the basis for the
creation of new forms of advertising
(Gaubaa et al., 2017).
Through EEG, Emotiv Epoc interprets in

graphic registers the electrical activity of the
neurons inside the brain; caused by stimuli
from receiving organs. The contact of
neurons is known as synapses, this process
produces a chemical-electrical discharge that
secretes a substance located in the space
between the transmitting neuron and the
receptive one, so that the impulse can reach
the axon (long end of a neuron) (Guevara
2012).
Within the process described above, (Ron
Angevin 2005) and (Silva-Pereyra 2011)
highlight that neurons are polarized by
having negative energy charges inside the
cell membrane with respect to the outside,
this happens due to the circulation of ions of
potassium when at the same time inside the
cell there are negative charge molecules with
external presence of sodium ions with a
value of 70mV (mini volt). In summary,
according to (Tong and Thakor 2009), (Ron
Angevin 2005), (Silva-Pereyra 2011) and
(Christa et al., 2006) to provoke the "action
potential," a stimulating current generated by
ions of potassium that enter the cell is
needed, depolarizing it with a positive
electric charge. Once this potential is
reached by the axon, an ion exchange occurs.
To counteract this action, a sodium
concentration inside generates an expulsion
of potassium and sodium ions to restore the
negative charge, briefly making it more
negative. This electrical activity is measured
by the EEG by placing electrodes on the
surface of the scalp, by doing this you can
measure the oscillations or changes of
powers related to the presentation of an
event, since there is a variety of rhythms
either by its band of frequency, location in
the brain, the amplitude of the signal and
other aspects inherent to the ones that were
previously mentioned. The measurement
parameters are variants according to the
mental state of the measured subject, that is
why four important rhythms within the EEG
can be highlighted: Delta rhythm (0.5 to 3.5
Hz), Theta (4 to 7 Hz), Alpha (8 to 13 Hz),
Beta (14 to 30 Hz) and Mu (8 to 13 Hz) (Ron

949

Angevin 2005).
Authors such as (Khushaba et al., 2013)
indicate that the analysis of invasive and
non-invasive brain electrical signals, are
recorded through a brain-computer interface,
for the analysis of non-linear signals in
frequency and time, in conjunction with
Parseval's theorem, which is used to obtain
the percentage of distribution of the
energetic typologies of the EEG signal in
different resolution levels. In the present
study, the electroencephalographic signals
that were measured with the Emotiv Epoc
starting from the presentation of the
advertising spots, were the alpha and beta
signals; the first is present in any subject in a
state of relaxation or little neuronal activity
and is attenuated when the

Given the limitations that could take place
when applying just a single technique, this
research was conducted in two stages that
together managed to cover a much broader
picture and consequently its objectives. In
the first stage, the people under study

observed 4 spots or commercials and were
then asked to answer a questionnaire in order
to evaluate their perceptions. The spots were
previously selected according to the items
shown in the following table.

The second stage combined participant
observation with neuromarketing. The first,
based on the approaches of (Belk 2017)
(Polkinghorne 2005) and (Boyland and
Halford 2013) who suggest that consumer
behavior must be studied using the technique
of observation of gesticulation, interest,
reactions, motivation and emotions that the
person presents in response to the
advertisement.
The experimental method was based on the
proposal by (Gneezy 2017) who uses the
Neuromarketing tool known as Emotiv Epoc
in order to analyze the EEG waves of a

group of people. In the application of this
technique a non-probabilistic sample is used
(used in direct observation). 2 commercials
were presented to the people under study, the
first did not have the storytelling technique
while the second easily demonstrated its
application.
The same spots of the first stage were used
for experimentation, all the rules and

The study suggested the use of a 6-channel

and T8) to collect EEG signals from the
frontal and temporal brain areas that can
provide data to estimate consumer choice
regarding an advertising spot (Aprilianty,
Purwanegara and Suprijanto 2)

4. Results and discussion
The frequency table presented the results of
the analysis of the surveys and shows the
attitude towards the advertisement, which is
of a multidimensional nature; this analysis
clearly shows that there are important
differences in all the cognitive measures of
effectiveness used in this research, it
demonstrated that the storytelling technique
registers the highest rates of recall and brand
recognition.

When taking the EEG signals the
participants
mostly
presented
facial
expressions that showed interest and
emotion, such as faint movements of the
mouth and eyes. It is necessary to point out
that before the stim ulation, patients were
in a state of alert , nevertheless, when the
first stimulation was presented (spot 1) their
notorious facial expression was in the eyes,
which showed impact and surprise followed
by a warning position; and in the second
stimulation most participants showed a
relaxed posture, their facial expressions
reflected concentration, combined with joy
and discomfort in several intervals of time
while spot 2 lasted, these reactions occurred
because of the story that was presented .
Additionally, it should be taken into account
that stimulations do not provoke the same
emotion in people, since there are
individuals who present expressions that are

In the data processing stage, six electrodes
were considered, in the first group the frontal
lobes AF3, AF4, F3 and F4 were analyzed,
where it is possible to see variations in the
alpha brain waves. The greatest variation in
this frequency band was obtained during the
stimulation of spot 2, which has the
storytelling technique. In this scenario, it is
deduced that the signal is intensified due to
the existence of emotions associated with a
problem and its resolution. The increase in
intensity in the alpha waves is given by the
insight that the brand applies to its spot
combined with the storytelling technique,
making the neuronal activity of the
individuals under study vary and increase.
In the second group, we studied the T7 and
T8 temporal lobes that are related to hearing.

A greater point of concurrence is not
observed in these lobes as was in the
previous electrodes since the EEG waves are
not periodic and do not concentrate on a
single point in a certain time.
The stimulus caused by the second spot can
modulate the activity of the neurons in the
frontal area of the brain in the 12th to the 15th
second. However, there are data that
contradict this fact in relation to the first spot
since the signals are intensified by the high
decibels of the sound with respect to spot 2.
The value of the beta brain wave amplitude
in the 2nd spot is the highest. Based on the
results, participants gave a lower response to
the stimulus of spot 1 and tend to give the

Correlación

The results of the t distribution in the table
shows that in the alpha waves with the
stimulation of spot 2 there is a variation in
the attention and hearing in all the volunteers
of the study. This alteration occurs in both
the left and right hemispheres of the brain,
F3, F4 and T8, where p <0.05. These results
show that there is a significant alteration in
these electrodes; the first two are related to
emotions and the last one is associated with
the hearing area. These values are significant
since sounds attract attention and changes
the state of attention in an individual.
In the correlation, there is not a significant

positive or negative relationship; that is, the
stimulus caused by spot 2 alters the
frequency band alpha and beta. However,
this characteristic is not clearly defined as
positive or negative.
When analyzing the volunteers, the highest
correlation generated before the stimulation
and after presenting spot 1 in both the alpha
and beta waves is discarded since it is the
result of a very considerable variation of the
data, due to the intermittence of noise during
the stimulation.

5. Conclusion
The study confirms the effectiveness of
storytelling in advertising spots. Based on
the results, it can be seen that in general, spot
2 can influence the emotion of consumers,
which in turn contributes to brand
recognition.
From the 6 electrodes analyzed, AF3, AF4,
F3, F4, T7 and T8, variations in Alpha brain
waves can be observed. The greatest
variation in this frequency band was
obtained during the stimulation of spot 2,
which contains the storytelling technique. In
this scenario, it is deduced that the signal is
intensified by the existence of emotions
associated with a problem and its resolution.
The increase in intensity in alpha waves is
given by the insight that the brand applies to
its spot combined with the storytelling
technique, making the neuronal activity of
the individuals analyzed vary and increase.
With the analysis of the t distribution, we
observed that in the alpha frequency band,
with the stimulation of spot 2, a variation in
attention and hearing was presented in all the
volunteers under study. This alteration
occurs in both the left and right hemispheres
of the brain, F3, F4 and T8, where p <0.05.
These results show that there is a significant

alteration in these electrodes; the first two
are related to emotions and the last one is
associated with the hearing area. These
values are significant since a sound attracts
attention and changes the state of attention of
an individual.
In the correlation, there is not a significant
positive or a negative relationship. However,
there is a variation only when considering
the spot that is using the technique. To
summarize, the application of the
questionnaire,
observation
and
experimentation coincide that the application
of storytelling in advertising spots increases
effectiveness regarding the interest and
brand recall in the audience whenever they
are directed to the segmented target
audience.

6. Limitations
• The use of the Emotiv Epoc helmet must
have the necessary conditions so that the
noise does not affect the results of the taken
signals.
• The use of Emotiv Epoc needs the
registration of significant times for a better
attraction and recording of the neuronal
behavior of the individual's brain
