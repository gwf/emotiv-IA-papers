Abstract—Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) have become
very popular with Electroencephalography (EEG) being one
of the most commonly used signal acquisition techniques. A
major challenge in BCI studies is the individualistic analysis required for each task. Thus, task-specific feature extraction and
classification are performed, which fails to generalize to other
tasks with similar time-series EEG input data. To this end, we
design a GRU-based universal deep encoding architecture to
extract meaningful features from publicly available datasets for
five diverse EEG-based classification tasks. Our network can
generate task and format-independent data representation and
outperform the state of the art EEGNet architecture on most
experiments. We also compare our results with CNN-based,
and Autoencoder networks, in turn performing local, spatial,
temporal and unsupervised analysis on the data.

incorporates temporal dependencies in the data and can thus
overcome the limitations of EEGNet. We also compare its
performance with other networks like CNN-based network
[7] and Autoencoder networks (Section IV), on five significantly different EEG-based datasets including Emotion
Detection [8], Digit Recognition (Section III-B), Object
Recognition [7], Task Identification [9] and Error Detection
[10]. The proposed universal encoding architecture yields
comparable results and in many cases outperforms the state
of the art methods across all downstream tasks.

EEG signals are one of the most common methods
of mapping brain activity due to its non-invasive nature,
portability, cost, safety, and high temporal resolution. Other
methods include Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) have a
lower time resolution and unlike EEG, measure changes
in blood flow or metabolic activities, which are indirect
indicators of brain electrical activity.
Previous work in this field have used EEG signals to
classify hand motions [11], songs based on human thoughts
[12], for medical purposes such as diagnosing epilepsy [13]
and Autism Spectrum Disorder [14], rehabilitation purposes
[15], and as feedback mechanisms in therapies for PostTraumatic Stress Disorder [16], Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder [17] and several other applications.
Since EEG signals are time series data, extracted features (e.g. Wavelet Transformation, Independent Component
Analysis, Autoregression, and Empirical Mode Decomposition [18]) must represent the data meaningfully. However,
these are manually engineered making it difficult to select
the best set of extraction methods and wave properties to
capture the complex nature of EEG data. Previous work suggests eigenfeature methods (like computing Power Spectral
Densities on segmented EEG [19]), Fast Fourier Transform
[20] and Genetic Algorithms [21].
With the rise in the popularity of Deep Learning methods,
the task of extracting optimal features from EEG data has
been simplified via representation learning. Recent work
in this direction use simple feed forward networks [22],
[23] and unsupervised auto-encoder based methods [24].
However, most works generate feature vectors only for a
given task and do not try to generalise it to different tasks.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) create a direct communication of the human brain with an external agent and
serves applications in the fields of healthcare, neuroprosthetics, rehabilitation, robotics, entertainment, security among
many others [1], [2]. Electroencephalogram (EEG) based
signal acquisition is a non-invasive technique [3] wherein
electrodes on the scalp record signals with respect to time.
Analyzing EEG signals requires effective methods to extract
meaningful features which are usually tailored to a particular
task.
A universal encoding can allow efficient comparison and
evaluation across multiple datasets using a shared network
for generating the feature vector. A common feature encoding can help in studying the patterns and relations between
various types of EEG signals. This can potentially eradicate
the need for task dependent investigation and manual handcrafted feature extraction which is often very cumbersome.
Recent work by Lawhern et al. [4] proposed EEGNet,
which develops a compact convolutional neural network
(CNN) for EEG data. This network performs consistently
well across different downstream tasks. A major limitation of
EEGNet is that it uses a CNN network reflecting its inability
to capture the sequential nature of the data.
In this paper, we propose a GRU-based universal deep
learning encoding architecture for various EEG-based downstream tasks. The GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) [5], [6]

II. L ITERATURE S URVEY

EEGNet [4] is a recent work that uses a CNN based
architecture as a universal encoder for various downstream
classification tasks. EEGNet attempts to generalize over four
tasks which include ERP based task, P300 Speller task,
Movement Related Cortical Potential task and the Sensory
Motor Rhythm task.
We consider the EEGNet as our baseline approach since
its concept and approach directly competes with our proposed solution and compare it to our designed architecture,
as shown in Section V. We also consider several other
models as reference point to validate our results further.

In this work, we utilize several publicly accessible
datasets. The idea was to pick datasets pertaining to a diverse
range of EEG based tasks spread across various modalities
like text [25], audio [26], visual [27], [28] and more [29] so
that the encoder network can learn different data patterns.
Table I provides a summary of datasets used.

channels at a sampling rate of 128 Hz with post-processing
done using a sliding window of 32 samples with an overlap
of 8. We have only used the object data for our experiments
since we believe that EEG collected from object images as
stimulus will evoke more prominent signals and also because
BMNIST dataset already incorporates digit stimuli. The state
of the art accuracies for digit, character and object 10-class
classification is 72.88%, 71.18% and 72.95% using VGG-16
network architecture [7].

A. SEED: Emotion Detection

D. Sensory Motor Recognition: Task Identification

SEED is a popular dataset for the task of emotion detection, which contains a 62-channel data from 15 participants (7 male and 8 females) while being stimulated by
six chosen emotional movie films. The task is essentially
a three class classification amongst positive, negative and
neutral emotions. The state of the art for SEED tri-class
classification reports an accuracy of 83.99% using SVM
and 86.02% using Deep Belief Network using handcrafted
features of Differential Entropy, Differential Asymmetry and
PSD [8].

This dataset3 belongs to the BCI competition 2008, Set
2A [9]. Data is collected from 9 subjects, who were asked to
imagine 4 types of sensory tasks—left hand movement, right
hand movement, foot movement or tongue movement. Data
is sampled at 250 Hz and a band pass filter was applied at
0.5 Hz and 100 Hz. The state of the art accuracy for withinsubject is 68% and for cross-subject is 40%. To maintain
consistency in all experiments, we have not segregated SMR
test data into within or cross-subject.

B. MindBigData BMNIST: Digit Recognition

For the Error Detection task, 56 channel EEG data from
26 healthy subjects (13 male) was collected in Margaux et
al.’s work [10] and was used in Kaggle’s BCI Challenge4 . A
P300 [32] speller is used which is a communication device
that allows a subject to spell out text by focusing on each
character located at some position on a 6 × 6 grid. While
the subject focuses on a character, random flashing of rows
and columns on this grid causes an ERP and alters the EEG
pattern which is detected. The aim is to determine if the
selected item is correct or incorrect by analyzing the brain
signals after the subject received feedback. The state of the
art AUC reported for this dataset [33] using handcrafted
features is 0.872, while EEGNet baseline achieved an AUC
of 0.8.

III. DATASETS

The BMNIST dataset1 contains over 1,200,000 brain
signal samples of 2 seconds each, acquired at different
frequencies. The stimulus is a digit from 0–9. Brain signals
are captured when the participant sees and thinks about the
exposed stimuli. The data has been captured using Muse
headband consisting of 4 channels. Some EEG signals were
also captured on random actions and labelled as -1. The brain
signals are captured over a course of two years from a single
test subject. The reported state of the art accuracy for this
dataset is 31.35% [30] for 11-class (0–9 or -1) classification
and 98% for binary classification (digit or not).
C. ThoughtViz: Object Recognition
This dataset2 is acquired from Kumar et al.’s work [31],
as described in ThoughtViz [7]. It contains EEG recordings
of 23 participants who were shown stimuli of three kinds Characters, Digits and day-to-day Objects. Each set contains
10 items, making a total of 30 stimuli (classes). The data
is collected using Emotiv EPOC + EEG headset with 14

IV. M ETHODOLOGY
We develop a generic architecture for generating encodings for all kinds of EEG data and understand how the learnt
representations perform in comparison to existing works
on various downstream tasks. We implemented CNN-based,

GRU-based and Autoencoder-based networks, which are
discussed in the sections below and shown in Figure 1. The
encoding obtained from network is forwarded to downstream
classification task and their performances were analyzed to
find the best encoding architecture. The results obtained over
all datasets using each encoding network are evaluated and
compared in Table II. The train-test-validation split is kept
same as dictated by the respective dataset sources. If it is
not specified, we reserve 25% of data for testing and 25%
of train data for validation. All models were trained with
maximum epochs of 100, and best model was picked based
on validation accuracy. The experiments were performed on
a system with 50 GB RAM, 16 CPU Cores and 3 NVIDIA
GTX 1080Ti GPU.

A. CNN-based Networks
CNNs have shown success in capturing spatial dependencies in the input using convolution operations and filters.
CNNs utilize parameter sharing and local connectivity to
optimize the number of parameters. We have implemented
EEGNet [4] architecture. We also replicated the 4 CNN
based network using combination of two 1D and two 2D
convolutional layers inspired by by Tirupattur et al. [7]
along with batch normalization and max pooling layers. The
convolutional layers consist of (filter, kernels) = (32, (1, 4)),
(32, (14, 1)), (50, (4, 25)) and (100, (50, 2)) activated using
ReLU and flattened at the output. We use Adam Optimizer
with a learning rate of 0.001, a batch size of 128 and
trained for 100 epochs using a categorical cross-entropy loss.
The fully connected classifier uses two dense layers of size
256 and num classes respectively with a dropout having
probability 0.5 and ReLU activation for hidden layer and
softmax activation for output layer. Public implementation

B. GRU-based Network
Since EEG is a time-series data, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are expected to perform better. They are able
to feed the output back into the network. However, they
suffer from the vanishing gradient problem. To solve the
same the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) [5], [6] was proposed,
which uses the update and reset gates. The update gate
helps the model decide how much of the past information
needs to be passed on to the future iterations, while the
reset gate determines how much of the past information is
to be forgotten. We have developed a GRU-based network,
as shown in Figure 2 where two 1D convolution layers
followed by a 2D convolutional layer are used following
which the GRU layer is added. The convolutional layers
consist of (filter, kernels) = (32, (1, 4)), (32, (14, 1)) and
Depthwise 2D Convolution (50, (4, 25)). A GRU sequence
of 30 GRU nodes was used for each output channel from
the convolutional part. The final encoding is generated by a
dense layer. We use Adam Optimizer with a learning rate of
0.001 and a batch size of 64 for the training.
C. Autoencoder Network
An autoencoder is an unsupervised technique used to learn
data encoding. It has two parts—the encoder compresses
data and reduces dimensionality to generate an encoding,
while the decoder tries to regenerate the original input using
the encoding. For our experiment, we use the encoding learnt
by the autoencoder and redirecting it to a suitable classifier
like random forest or K nearest neighbours. The encoder
uses convolutional layers from 4CNN architecture (two 1D
and two 2D convolutions; ReLU activations; (filter, kernels)
= (32, (1, 4)), (32, (14, 1)), (50, (4, 25)) and (100, (50,
2))) to extract feature representations which are max-pooled
and normalized using Batch Normalization. The extracted
representations are then flattened together and connected to
a Dense layer with the embedding size of 128, which marks

the end of encoder. For decoding phase, a stack of two dense
layers (equal to the flattened output and input data’s shape
respectively) with ReLU activation are used and then this
raw output is used for calculating loss. We use AdaDelta
optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, batch size of 128
and binary cross-entropy as loss function. KNN and Random
forest classifier uses sklearn’s default hyperparameters, viz
5 neighbors with uniform weighting for KNN and 100
estimators with no restriction on maximum tree depth for
random forest classifier.
V. R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION
We evaluated the performance of all architectures (Section
IV) on the five downstream tasks mentioned in Section III
and compared their performances, as shown in Table II.
Autoencoder models are not the top performing models
in any of the downstream tasks. For SEED, GRU-based
model significantly outperforms all other models. In the
ERN and BMNIST (11 class) tasks, GRU-based shows
similar performance to 4 CNN and EEGNet. In BMNIST (2
class) and ThoughtViz , GRU-based is the best performing
model. The 4 CNN network gives a similar performance
and both significantly outperform EEGNet in these tasks. In
ThoughtViz EEGNet has an accuracy of 25%, significantly
lesser than accuracy from all other models.
We observe that GRU-based network is, for most tasks,
the best performing model, with 4 CNN giving similar
performance in some cases. This shows the importance of
using temporal features to make accurate predictions on EEG
continuous signal data.
In the SMR task (Table II) however, both 4 CNN and
GRU-based models are significantly outperformed by EEGNet. From Table I we see that SMR and ERN are the two
smallest datasets. The SMR dataset is an Oscillatory BCI,
while ERN is Event Related Potential (ERP) BCI [34]. In
Event Related Potential (ERP) BCI tasks, the EEG response
to a known external stimulus is detected, while in Oscillatory
BCI tasks, signals are used from specific frequency bands
for controlling the interface. ERP tasks can be modelled by
Machine learning more efficiently than Oscillatory BCI tasks
[35]. This is because ERPs have high amplitude and low
frequency waveforms. Due to more dependency on external
stimuli, these are more robust across subjects. On the other

hand, Oscillatory tasks use brain signals for external control.
They are harder to train, due to lower signal-to-noise ratio
[36] and there is more variation across subjects. The signals
in Oscillatory BCIs are asynchronous [36], which can be
a limitation for GRUs, as they are designed for temporal
(Sequential) detection and work across the frequencies.
We also observe that GRU-based network significantly
outperform previous state of the art results on BMNIST and
ThoughViz. On SEED, despite being the best performing
model, it still lags behind the results achieved using handcrafted features [8].
VI. C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK
Through this work, we develop a common encoding
architecture for a variety of tasks. We can claim that using
deep learning based approaches, features significant to each
of the seemingly different tasks can be extracted and used
for classification. We have experimented with local analysis
using CNN, temporal analysis using GRUs and unsupervised analysis using Autoencoders. We achieved the best
performance using the GRU-based model where we were
also able to beat the best-reported performances on each
of the downstream tasks, with SMR task being the only
exception due to its oscillatory nature. This implies how
temporal features extracted from a GRU are successfully
able to represent the diversity in EEG data. Through such
experiments, we have introduced a variety of methods to
study EEG data using universal encodings and have in-turn
contributed to research in the field of BCI and neuroscience.
As part of future work, attention-based mechanisms can
be employed to further enhance the performance of the
GRU-based network. Oscillatory BCI tasks are a limitation
for the GRU-based architecture, which should be dealt with.
The auto-encoders can be further improved by guiding the
decoder using encoder (e.g using skip connections). Further,
since all these tasks involve EEG signal data, Multi-Task
Learning can be employed to learn collectively from the
various tasks.
