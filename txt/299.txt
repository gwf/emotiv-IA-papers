Abstract
Wearable EEG systems have become accessible to researchers and clinicians over the last decade,
thus requiring neurotechnology companies to seek for outstanding EEG signal quality. Here, we
show that the melomindTM headset equipped with dry electrodes (myBrain Technologies, Paris,
France) allows the recording of reliable electro-cortical dynamics as compared to a wet-based
standard-EEG system (actiCAP, Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany). EEGs were acquired
simultaneously from the two systems while thirteen subjects underwent a visual oddball, a steadystate visually-evoked potentials (SSVEPs) and two resting-state (RS) tasks. RS were acquired with
eyes-closed and eyes-open (2 minutes each) and repeated twice (before and after the cognitive tasks).
During the oddball task, participants responded on a gamepad when a target-stimulus was displayed.
In the SSVEPs, visual responses were elicited at 15 and 20 Hz through a series of 15-second stimuli
presented 5 times each. The power of theta- [4-8 Hz], alpha- [8-13 Hz], and beta- [13-30 Hz] band
was extracted from the two RS. The signal-to-noise-ratio in the 15 (± 1) and 20 (± 1) Hz range was
computed from the SSVEPs. The shape of the N2/P300 complex was analysed from the oddball
task. Strong correlations resulted between the parameters obtained from the two EEG systems (0.53
< Pearson’s r < 0.97). Bland and Altman analysis revealed small dissimilarities between the two
systems, with values laying in the 95% confidence interval in all the tasks. Our results demonstrate
that the melomindTM is an affordable solution to reliably assess humans’ electro-cortical dynamics atrest and during cognitive tasks, thus paving the way to its use in neuroscience studies and braincomputer interfaces.

Introduction
Recent advances in engineering and new discoveries in neurosciences have led to the birth of
numerous neurotechnology companies aimed at interfacing the human brain to the machines. As a
consequence, a broad number of low-cost, user-friendly devices has appeared on the market over the
last decade. Among these, wearable electroencephalography (EEG) systems have increasingly
attracted attention from both researchers and clinicians for their application potential (e.g., brainmachine interfaces, gaming, simulation), their extremely flexible utilization (Mihajlovic, Grundlehner,
Vullers, & Penders, 2015), as well as their relatively low invasiveness as compared to “standard” and
largely-more expensive EEG devices.
EEG traces recorded in laboratory settings used to require outstanding data quality in order to
allow analyses in multiple domains, such as the event-related potentials (ERPs) in the time-domain,
resting-state (RS) or visually-evoked potentials (SSVEPs) in the frequency-domain, brain oscillatory
dynamics and connectivity in the time-frequency domain, and beyond. Newer wearable EEG
systems are equipped with effective hardware (e.g., amplifiers specifications, electrode quality) and
software (e.g., real-time computations, on-line data quality algorithms, e.g., Grosselin et al., 2019)
components to achieve this goal (see Lopez-Gordo et al., 2014 for a systematic review). Therefore,
researchers are increasingly prone to use them in clinical trials and to disseminate their findings in
scientific journals. In this regard, the majority of the studies using portable EEG devices (e.g., Muse,
Emotiv EPOC) assessed the quality of the signal via ERPs analyses (Debener, Minow, Emkes,
Gandras, & de Vos, 2012; Duvinage et al., 2013; Badcock et al., 2013; Badcock et al., 2015;
Krigolson, Williams, Norton, Hassall, & Colino, 2017). More specifically, these works mainly focused
on the manifestation of the N2 and the P300 waveforms, two consecutive components of humans’
ERPs which are convincingly thought to reflect attentional resources allocated to visual stimuli (Luck
& Hillyard, 1994; Polich, 2007). However, EEG studies do not limit to ERPs, but often include both
SSVEPs and RS tasks. SSVEPs are elicited naturally from visual stimulation at specific flickering
frequencies and have been shown to serve to many applications in cognitive (e.g., Vialatte, Maurice,
Dauwels, & Cichocki, 2010; Zhang, Jamison, Engel, He, & He, 2011 and clinical neuroscience (e.g.,
Sokol, 1976; Birca, Carmant, Lortie, Vannasing, & Lassonde, 2008), as well as in brain-computer
interfaces (e.g., Giove, 2003; Kluge & Hartmann, 2007; Won, Zhang, Guan, & Lee, 2014). Yet,
recording the brain activity at-rest (RS) has revealed crucial information on the functional
significance of distributed neural network dynamics, on the hierarchy governing their interactions

(e.g., Mantini, Perrucci, Gratta, Romani, & Corbetta, 2007; Brookes et al., 2011) and on the
“language” these networks speak (i.e., frequencies) to mutually exchange information on perceptual,
motor, cognitive and emotional states. Cross-sectional or longitudinal changes of some of the
automated EEG parameters extracted from the resting-brain have increasingly been used to assess or
- in some cases - predict the onset of neurological diseases, such as the Alzheimer’s (Stam et al.,
2005) or the Parkinson’s (Jackson, Cole, Voytek, & Swann, 2019) disease.
To the best of our knowledge, a number of systematic studies exist on the comparison
between dry vs. wet electrodes -based portable EEGs (see Lopez-Gordo et al., 2014 for a review),
but the extent to which a given portable EEG system can reliably allow the assessment of humans’
electro-cortical dynamics in a wider range of laboratory protocols as compared to a standard, highquality EEG is still less explored.
In this work, we addressed all these issues by recording individuals’ brain activity using the
melomind™ headset (myBrain Technologies, Paris, France; https://www.melomind.com) and the
actiCAP

(BrainProducts

GmbH,

Gilching,

Germany; https://www.brainproducts.com/productdetails.php?id=68), simultaneously. Participants
underwent a comprehensive protocol including two-resting state recordings, a visual oddball task and
a SSVEPs task. Signals recorded from the melomind™ were compared to the signals recorded from
the actiCAP in order to assess both the efficacy of the melomind™ to acquire the canonical electrocortical markers underlying these tasks, and - importantly - the degree of (dis)similarity between the
two EEG systems.

Methods
Participants
Thirteen individuals (n = 13; 5 males; mean age; 31.4; age range: 20-52) took part in the study
following informed consent. Participants had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and
reported no symptoms/signs of neurological impairments. The study conformed the 1964
Declaration of Helsinki.

Procedure, Apparatus, Experimental Setup and Stimuli
Participants sat on a comfortable chair in a well-lightened room while dual EEG was recorded
through the melomindTM and the actiCAP. First the actiCAP electrode headset was placed and then
the melomindTM (Figure 1).

Figure 1 - Apparatus and experimental setup. A real recording session with both the melomindTM and the actiCAP
(left column). Right-column depicts the experimental setup and the apparatus, including: i) the PC used for stimuli
presentation, ii) the gamepad used to record individuals’ reaction-times in the odball task, iii) the Arduino DUE device
used to convey and synchronize event-markers to the melomindTM and the actiCAP (i.e., the ExG AUX Box
manufactured by Brain Products), iv) the melomindTM headset and v) an example of a portable device to which the
signals acquired from the melomindTM where sent via Bluetooth.

The whole experiment lasted about 1 hour and consisted of two Resting State (RS) EEG
recordings - one at the very beginning (RS-PRE) and one at the end (RS-POST) of the whole
procedure - one visual oddball task (P300 task), and one Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials
(SSVEPs) task. All the tasks, were coded in Python 3.6 using the PsychoPy 3 toolbox
(https://www.psychopy.org). Both the source-codes of the tasks and documentations are freely
downloadable at https://github.com/mbt-administrator/Research.Tasks.
The order of the oddball and SSVEPs task was balanced across subjects. Stimuli were presented
on an ASUS Strix Hero II Laptop equipped with an 15.6-inch LCD screen (refresh-rate: 60Hz) and a
GPU NVIDIA® GeForce RTX 2060 (https://www.asus.com/Laptops/ROG-Strix-Hero-II/TechSpecs). The laptop was placed at a distance of approximately 60 cm from the participant and
connected to an Arduino DUE device (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoDue) which

governed the synchronization of event-markers conveyed to the melomindTM and to the actiCAP.
Figure 1 depicts the schema of the experimental setup and the apparatus.
Each RS condition (i.e., RS-PRE and RS-POST) lasted 4 minutes and consisted of 2 minutes eyesclosed and 2 minutes eyes-open EEG recording. Before undergoing the task, participants received
written instructions on the PC screen upon the procedure. First, they were asked to close their eyes
and keep them closed until a 0.5 Hz alert tone was provided. Then, they were requested to continue
with the eyes-open recording by pressing a key on the PC-keyboard. In this phase, a white fixationcross (against a black-background) was presented on the screen to minimise eyes movements and
blinks. Event-markers were sent to the EEGs at the onset, the middle and the offset of each RS
recording.
During the P300 task, 10 series of blue (RGB = [0 0 255]) and green (RGB = [0 255 0]) coloured
squares (against a black background) were randomly presented for 800 ms. Each stimulus was
preceded by a white fixation-cross lasting from 500 to 1500 ms to avoid any habituation effect. The
frequency of the blue stimulus (i.e., the ‘rare’ one) differed across the 10 series, such that in 5 series
its frequency was 20% (i.e., 6 times over 30 stimuli), and in 5 series its frequency was 40% (i.e., 12
times over 30), with the order of series being completely randomised across subjects. Participants
were instructed to press a key-button on a gamepad as soon as the blue stimulus had appeared on the
screen. The task counted a total of 300 trials (i.e., 10 series times 30 stimuli) and lasted approximately
20 minutes. A short pause occurred between each trials-series. Event-markers were sent to the EEGs
at the onset of each series and at the onset of each stimulus of interest.
In the SSVEPs paradigm, visual responses were elicited at 15 Hz and 20 Hz. This allowed us to
eliminate both i) the superposition of the alpha range (8-13 Hz) and ii) any rendering issue due to the
60 Hz refresh-rate of the LCD display. Each subject was instructed to focus on a white square
(against a black background) flickering at the stimulation frequency (i.e., 15 or 20 Hz) for 15 seconds.
Participants underwent 10 trials, 5 of them at a flickering-stimulation of 15 Hz and 5 at 20 Hz. Each
stimulus was preceded by a white fixation-cross (against a black background) lasting 3 seconds and
followed by a 45-second pause. A 0.5 Hz tone was delivered 5 seconds before the onset of each trial
to alert participants on the onset of the new trial. The order of trials was randomised across subjects.
Event-markers were sent to the EEG at the onset, the middle and the offset of each trial.

EEG recording and analysis
Individuals’ EEG was acquired simultaneously with the melomindTM and the actiCAP (Figure 1).
The melomindTM is a portable and wireless EEG headset equipped with two gold-coated dry sensors
placed on P3 and P4 sites according to the 10-20 International System. Two textile electrodes are
placed on the left- and right- mastoids which serve as ground and reference sites, respectively. EEG
signals are acquired at 250 Hz and sent via Bluetooth to a mobile device for both visualisation and
storage purposes. As for the actiCAP, signals were acquired from 11 wet electrodes (i.e., F3, Fz, F4,
C3, Cz, C4, P1, Pz, P2, O1, O2) arranged on the scalp according to the 10-20 International System.
The AFz served as ground electrode and P10 as online reference electrode. The P10 electrode site
was chosen as reference electrode because of its closer proximity to the melomindTM reference
location (i.e., the right mastoid). The signals were amplified and digitalised at 1000 Hz and then
down-sampled offline at 250 Hz to allow comparison with the melomindTM. Impedances were kept
below 25 KOhm, according to the factory standards for achieving outstanding data quality when
using active electrodes. Event-markers were sent simultaneously to both the auxiliary port of the
melomindTM (mini-USB) and the Brain Product auxiliary device (i.e., ExG AUX Box, with 8 bipolar
inputs and 8 AUX inputs) via a custom-made circuit governed by an Arduino DUE device and
controlled by ad hoc PsychoPy 3 routines (https://www.psychopy.org/api/serial.html). Baud-rate of
the serial port was 9600 Hz. The time taken for each TTL pulse to reach the two systems from the
Arduino after any command was sent from the PsycoPy routine was measured by an oscilloscope. In
this, a series of TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) pulses was sent, resulting in a mean lag of 30 ms.
The lag between the two systems to receive a pulse was < 1 ms (range: 0-3 ms), which was mainly
accounted for by their different sampling rates.

Resting-state analysis. For each participant, continuous EEG traces from the melomindTM and from
the actiCAP were filtered with a dual pass Butterworth filter of 1-30 Hz and a 50 Hz Notch filter.
Eyes-closed and eyes-open segments were then created for the two Resting-State recordings (i.e., RSPRE and RS-POST), each lasting 2 minutes. A frequency analysis was then carried out by means of a
multi-tapered Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using Hanning taper in the 2-30 Hz frequency-range.

Band-power was computed by taking the squared magnitude of the real and imaginary Fourier
spectra. The relative power was obtained by dividing the power in the eyes-closed condition to the
power of the eyes-open condition. The median activity from the bi-parietal electrodes of the
melomindTM (i.e., P3/P4) and of the actiCAP(i.e., P1/P2) was taken. Values of the whole powerspectrum (2-30 Hz) as well as the power-spectra in the theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (1330 Hz) range were extracted from each participant and from both the RS-PRE and RS-POST
condition,

separately.

P300 analysis. A dual pass Butterworth filter in the 0.5-30 Hz range was applied to each individuals’
EEG to avoid any signal distortion in the ERPs (Tanner, Morgan-Short, & Luck, 2015). A 50 Hz
Notch was also applied. The EEG traces were first segmented by taking 500 ms before and 800 ms
after the onset of each stimulus of interest and then corrected with respect to the 500 ms timewindow preceding the onset of each stimulus. The resulting epochs were first averaged for each
condition and then subtracted each other (i.e., ‘rare’ minus ‘frequent’). Finally, the median across the
bi-parietal electrodes was computed from the melomindTM (i.e., P3 and P4) and from the actiCAP
(i.e., P1 and P2). For each participant, the following features were extracted: i) voltage values (in µV)
in the whole epoch (from -500 to 800 ms), ii) voltage values (in µV) in the N2 time-window (from
150 to 250 ms) and iii) voltage values (in µV) in the P300 time-window (from 250 to 550 ms).
SSVEPs analysis. Individuals’ neural time-series were filtered using a 2-30 Hz dual pass
Butterworth filter, and a 50 Hz Notch filter. Data was then segmented from the onset of the
stimulus of interest (i.e., 15 Hz and 20 Hz) to 15 seconds after. A multi-tapered FFT was then
computed in the 2-30 Hz frequency range and the band-power was calculated form each subject,
electrode and trial. The average across trials was then computed, and the median across the biparietal electrodes of the two systems (melomindTM [P3/P4]; actiCAP [P1/P2]) was taken. The
Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) was calculated to quantify the strength of the visually evoked brain
response compared to the background power (Tautan, Serdijn, Mihajlovic, Grundlehner, & Penders,
2013). To achieve this in each condition separately, each power spectra was normalised with respect
to the sum of the power-spectrum outside the band of interest (i.e., 15 ± 1 Hz and 20 ± 1Hz).
Individuals’ whole power-spectrum (2-30 Hz) was extracted from the two conditions, as well as the
power-spectra in both the 15 Hz (± 1 Hz) and 20 Hz (± 1 Hz) range.
In order to assess statistically any (dis)similarity between the features extracted from the
melomindTM and from the actiCAP, two approaches were used, namely: i) the degree of agreement

between variables, using the Bland and Altman method (Bland & Altman, 1986), and ii) a
permutation-based Pearson’s correlation analysis, The Bland and Altman method allowed us to
assess the degree of agreement between the melomindTM and the actiCAP and, importantly, the
likelihood of disagreement between the two measurements. Noteworthy, this analysis posits that if
the degree of disagreement in measuring a given phenomenon between two methods is negligible,
one can reliably use the two methods interchangeably. In summary, this method consists in
examining the data by plotting their difference against their mean, thus allowing to investigate any
relationship between the measurement error (i.e., the difference) and the best estimate of the true
value (i.e., the mean). Then, the mean difference between the two methods (d) and the limits of
agreement, i.e., the 95% confidence interval (d ± 1.96 SD) around d, are calculated. Good agreement
exists if most of the differences lie between the limits of agreement. As for the correlation analysis,
the Person’s r coefficient was first calculated for each of the (actual) observed features recorded from
the two EEG systems. Then, a permutation distribution of the Pearson’s r coefficient was computed
by shuffling one of the two arrays of values for n times - where n is the number of permutations (i.e.,
n = 1000). The probability of getting a true value was ultimately calculated by means of the MonteCarlo method.

Results
Bland and Altman analysis for all the tasks and all the features is presented in Table 1. Table 2
details the results of the correlation analysis.
Resting State data. Figure 2 depicts the power-spectral density (PSD) graphs computed from the
melomindTM and from the actiCAP in the two Resting-State conditions (RS-PRE and RS-POST). As
expected, the normalisation between the eyes-closed and the eyes-open condition resulted in an
increase of the alpha-band (8-13 Hz) power.

Bland and Altman analysis for the whole spectrum showed comparable results for the melomindTM

to zero in the RS-POST (overall mean difference: -0.51 ± 0.43) as compared to the RS-PRE (overall

In addition, the correlation analysis proved a very strong similarity between the melomindTM and
the actiCAP, with all the features of interest showing a correlation coefficient higher than 0.5 in the
RS-PRE and higher than 0.8 in the RS-POST (Table 2).
P300 data. Figure 4 depicts the grand mean of the N2/P300 complex as resulted from the
melomindTM (in blue) and the actiCAP (in orange). The comparisons between the two signals in the
whole epoch-range (from -500 to 800 ms) revealed very small dissimilarities between the
melomindTM and the actiCAP, with differences being close to zero (mean difference: 0.35 µV) and
lying in the limits of agreement. This result was replicated in the N2 (150-250 ms; mean difference: 1.29 µV) and in the P300 (250-550 ms; mean difference: 0.86 µV) time-window (Table 1). Also, high
similarities between the two signals were found, as resulted from the permutation-based correlation
analysis. Very-high correlation coefficients were found both in the whole epoch (r = 0.80) and in the
N2 range (r = 0.91). A high correlation was rendered in the P300 range (r = 0.56).

grey lines depict the frequency-ranges concerned in the analyses, i.e 15 ± 1 Hz and 20 ± 1 Hz.

More specifically, the Bland and Altman analysis showed overall highly comparable power spectra,
with differences being extremely close to 0 in both the experimental conditions. These results
replicated when considering narrower band-power values around the two frequencies of interests,
i.e., when extracting power-spectra in the 14-16 Hz (for the 15 Hz condition) and in 19-21 Hz range
(for the 20 Hz condition). In this, the analysis revealed that while the averaged differences between
the melomindTM and the actiCAP were more spread around zero (i.e., for the 15 Hz condition: 0.004; for the 20 Hz condition: -0.003), they still largely lied in the limits of agreements (Figure 6 and

Figure 6 - Degree of agreement between melomindTM and actiCAP in the SSVEPs task: The Bland and Altman
plot of the bi-parietal electrode-sites (i.e., P1/P2 for actiCAP and P3/P4 for melomindTM) computed in both the 15 Hz
(left-column) and 20 Hz (right-column) stimulation condition. Averaged values between the melomindTM and the
actiCAP (x-axes) are plotted against their difference (y-axes). Solid-grey lines show the mean difference between the two
EEG systems. Dotted-grey lines depict the 95% confidence interval around the mean, i.e., the upper- (mean + 1.96 SD)
and the lower- (mean – 1.96 SD) limits of agreement.

Moreover, the permutation-based correlation analyses pointed out a very strong similarity between
the cortical responses recorded from the melomindTM and from the actiCAP, with all Pearsons’s
coefficients being higher than 0.84 (Table 2). Noteworthy, the strength of the correlations increased
for the band-frequencies of interest (for 15 Hz: 0.96; for 20 Hz: 0.97) as compared to the wholespectrum analysis (for 15 Hz: 0.86; for 20 Hz: 0.85).

Discussion
In this study, we tested the efficacy of the melomindTM headset to record humans’ electro-cortical
activity in a laboratory setting. EEG traces were acquired simultaneously from the melomindTM and
from the actiCAP while participants performed both resting-state and cognitive tasks. Such a
comprehensive approach allowed us to test the behavior of the melomindTM in different
experimental protocols, as well as to evaluate any dissimilarities with respect to a standard, highquality EEG system. In summary, electro-cortical signatures extracted from the melomindTM were
comparable and highly correlated to those of the actiCAP in all the tasks.

As for the resting-state recordings, differences in automated spectral parameters were
negligible in both the two recordings (i.e., PRE and POST). The RS-POST condition showed closer
similarities between the two EEG systems as compared to the RS-PRE. While we do not have a firm
examination on this issue, we tend to suggest that dry-electrodes need a wider time to produce data
quality as good as a standard-EEG system. In this vein, the “time-factor” might have played a crucial
role to ensure a better contact between the dry-sensors and the scalp. Alternatively, one can assume
that a wider time span is needed in order for the melomindTM headset to optimally fit (and coexist)
with the actiCAP. While on the one hand this is a potential source of limitation of our study, on the
other we bring new insights on how simultaneous EEG recording using two different systems (drypassive vs. wet-active) - which remains likely critical (Lopez-Gordo et al., 2014) - might be
implemented to minimize any source of bias. However, the whole power spectrum, the theta- and
the beta- band power showed the lowest dissimilarities between the two EEG devices in both RSPRE and RS-POST. While, on the one hand, differences in the alpha-band power were found to be
overall bigger as compared to all the other bands, on the other hand they became sensibly closer to
zero in the RS-POST with respect to the RS-PRE. Despite this, similarities between the two systems
were optimal, as demonstrated by the permutation-based correlation analysis. This suggests that the
melomindTM and the actiCAP are genuinely interchangeable to record brain activity at-rest, albeit i)
the analyses were carried out at slightly different bi-parietal sites (P1/P2 vs. P3/P4) and ii) the types
of electrodes-set differed between the two devices (passive-dry electrodes for the melomindTM vs.
active-wet electrodes for the actiCAP). On a related issue, a previous work showed an overall good
correlation (r > 0.48) between signals recorded from dry vs. gel electrodes in both eyes-closed and
eyes-open resting-state (Tautan, Serdijn, Mihajlovic, Grundlehner, & Penders, 2013). Our results fit
with this existing evidence and provide further support on the fact that signal differences can be
minimized when similar recording configurations are concerned between two EEG systems, i.e.,
shorter distances between electrodes. Moreover, here we provide further details on the performance
or dry-passive vs. wet-active electrodes in recording the power of different frequency-bands. Indeed,
communication between two (or more) brain systems is rhythmic (oscillatory) and depends on the
“state” of the systems, being a “state” a specific configuration of a system (e.g., hypo/hyperactivation, drowsiness, meditation, relaxation, etc.). Noteworthy, the speed by which brain systems
change their states (i.e., the frequencies) are essential to transmit multiple channels of information at
the same time across brain networks. In addition, neuroscience studies have shown that spontaneous
brain oscillatory activities are of crucial interest to study neuro-cognitive default modes in the

“healthy” brain (Laufs et al., 2003; Jap, Lal, Fischer, & Bekiaris, 2009) as well as in a vast variety of
neuro-psychiatric diseases, such as Alzheimer (Stam et al., 2005; Kowalski, Gawel, Pfeffer, &
Barcikowska, 2001), Parkinson (Klassen et al., 2011), depression (Gotlib, 1998), anxiety (Thibodeau,
Jorgensen, & Kim, 2006), autism (Murias, Webb, Greenson, & Dawson, 2007). In this vein, our
results are of crucial importance to assess the extent to which the melomindTM headset may allow the
recording of oscillatory brain activity in different frequency-bands and possibly pave the way to these
research purposes.
In the oddball paradigm, the pattern of the whole evoked potential in the full time-window of
interest was comparable between the two EEG systems. No lag was found between the two signals
along the time course, thus suggesting that the melomindTM could not only detect fine-grain brain
dynamics in the time-domain, but also that the hardware allowed a reliable synchronization of
events-markers to the recorded signals. Noteworthy, this is an essential requirement for time-lock
analyses, in both the time-domain and the time-frequency domain. Also, in keeping with the seminal
validation study of dry and gel electrodes for P300-based BCI (Guger, Krausz, Allison, & Edlinger,
2012), dry-passive electrodes embedded in the melomindTM did not show a different efficacy as
compared to a set of wet-active sensors. While previous works performed with wearable EEG
systems (Debener, Minow, Emkes, Gandras, & de Vos, 2012; Badcock et al., 2013; Badcock et al.,
2015; Duvinage et al., 2013; Krigolson, Williams, Norton, Hassall, & Colino, 2017) showed merely
the presence of the N2/P300 complex in the grand-average, here we provided the first direct
comparison of the efficacy of a wearable EEG with respect to a standard-EEG in an oddball task. In
this, differences between the two EEG systems were negligible and correlations were good for the
P300 and high for the N2. P300-based tasks are among the most used ones in neuroscience to
investigate humans’ attention. Particularly, the amplitude of the P300 has been used to assess
physiological changes of attentional processes (Donchin, Kubovy, Kutas, Johnson, & Tterning,
1973; Polich, 2007), as well as to assess the risk to develop some diseases, such as alcoholism (Polich,
Pollock, & Bloom, 1994), schizophrenia (Mathalon, Ford, & Pfefferbaum, 2000), depression
(Gangadhar, Ancy, Janakiranaiah, & Umapathy, 1993), or Alzheimer’s disease (Polich, Ladish, &
Bloom, 1990). Similarily, the N2 component has been widely used to assess visual attention in
healthy subjects (Knight, 1997) as well as for diagnostic purposes in Alzheimer’s (Bennys, Portet,
Touchon, & Rondouin, 2007), ADHD (Tye et al., 2014) or binge-eating disorders (Leehr et al.,
2018). Also, recent advances in translational neuroscience have led to the birth of P300-based BCI to
provide people suffering from motor diseases with a flexible tool to interact quite autonomously with

the environment with the hope to recover from their state (Mak et al., 2012; Spüler et al., 2012).
While in the present work we did not directly test these issues, our results lead us to suggest that the
melomindTM headset may be a suitable device for these purposes.
Finally, the melomindTM and the actiCAP behave almost identically even in the SSVEPs task, with
differences being remarkably close to zero in both the two conditions (15 Hz and 20 Hz).
Correlations between the two systems showed the overall best results of all the reported analyses,
with Pearson’s r coefficients being always > 0.79 and the probability of getting a false-positive being
always < 0.001. These results demonstrate that the melomindTM can efficiently record sensory brain
responses elicited by flickering stimuli at different frequencies, and open the door to SSVEPs-based
BCI for both basic (e.g., Wang, Wang, & Jung, 2010; Allison et al., 2012) and translational (e.g.,
(Ortner, Allison, Korisek, Gaggl, & Pfurtscheller, 2011) research purposes.

Conclusions
Taken together these results suggest that the melomindTM headset allows the recording of EEG
traces as good as a standard, high-quality EEG system (i.e., the actiCAP). Noteworthy, the
melomindTM showed an overall outstanding signal quality in a comprehensive experimental protocol,
including resting-state recordings and cognitive tasks. The synchronization of marker-events to the
continuous EEG signals did not show any lag and allowed the recording of reliable electro-cortical
signatures in both the time- (ERPs) and in the frequency (RS, SSVEPs) domain. The high similarities
between the electro-cortical signatures recorded from the two EEG systems, together with the high
flexibility, the relatively low invasiveness and the low cost of melomindTM pave the way to its use in
laboratory settings. Therefore, we encourage the use of melomindTM to further replicate these
evidences in a wider variety of cognitive tasks, as well as in different and/or bigger cohorts.
