Filter Bank Common Spatial Patterns in Mental Workload Estimation

arXiv:1510.07263v1 [cs.HC] 25 Oct 2015

Abstract— EEG-based workload estimation technology provides a real time means of assessing mental workload. Such
technology can effectively enhance the performance of the
human-machine interaction and the learning process. When
designing workload estimation algorithms, a crucial signal
processing component is the feature extraction step. Despite
several studies on this field, the spatial properties of the EEG
signals were mostly neglected. Since EEG inherently has a poor
spacial resolution, features extracted individually from each
EEG channel may not be sufficiently efficient. This problem
becomes more pronounced when we use low-cost but convenient
EEG sensors with limited stability which is the case in practical
scenarios. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce a
filter bank common spatial patterns algorithm combined with
a feature selection method to extract spatio-spectral features
discriminating different mental workload levels. To evaluate
the proposed algorithm, we carry out a comparative analysis
between two representative types of working memory tasks
using data recorded from an Emotiv EPOC headset which is a
mobile low-cost EEG recording device. The experimental results
showed that the proposed spatial filtering algorithm outperformed the state-of-the algorithms in terms of the classification
accuracy.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recent advances in sensor technologies and computational algorithms make it possible to non-invasively monitor
brain activities and mental states. In particular, real-time
assessment of mental workload (MW) has attracted a lot
of attentions. Assessing MW can be beneficial in applications requiring high level of engagement, concentration and
alertness such as aviation, driving, education and industrial
production lines [1], [2].
In complex high demanding tasks, the human’s performance might drop due to the mental overload caused by
excessive amount of information to be processed. In contrast,
human tends to make errors when MW is kept in a lower
level than the proper level due to getting bored. Thus, to
achieve the best performance, the flow of the information and
the complexity of the task should be controlled by correctly
estimating the user’s MW [1], [2], [3]. In addition, a system
that provides real-time feedback based on the detected MW
might potentially enhance the cognitive performance and the
learning process by encouraging the user to stay focused and
engaged [4].
It is not still clear how to exactly define MW [5]. However,
it is well accepted that MW is correlated with task demand,

time pressure, person’s capacity and his/her performance [6].
Thus, in the existing studies, generally well-defined cognitive
tasks were used in different difficulty and demand levels to
manipulate a person’s MW level. Simultaneously, a range of
different physiological signals were recorded for estimating
the subject’s MW, such as pupil size, eye blink, skin conductance, electrocardiogram (ECG), and electroencephalogram (EEG). Interestingly, extensive comparisons reported
by different research groups revealed that EEG is the most
promising signal for estimating MW [7].
Studies that used EEG mostly achieved satisfactory results
based on band power features [8], [9]. It is shown that
theta (4-8Hz) and alpha (8-12Hz) are particularly sensitive
to changes in MW [8], [9], [10]. Typically, theta in the
frontal midline regions of the scalp increases as task demands
increase [10], while alpha decreases in parietal regions when
the workload increases [8], [9]. In addition to theta and alpha,
MW can also influence other frequency bands (e.g. gamma
and beta) in some subjects. Indeed, the exact locations and
the frequency bands affected by MW vary between subjects
and tasks [11], [12].
Despite several studies on the EEG-based estimation of
MW, the spatial properties of the EEG signals were mostly
neglected, and features were extracted from each channel
individually. However, due to volume conduction, EEG has
inherently a poor spatial resolution. Hence, applying proper
spatial filters increases the signal to noise ratio, and possibly leads to a more accurate MW estimation. Importantly,
the previous studies mostly relied on costly wired EEG
equipments which require injecting gel on the scalp to have
good quality signals. In order to use MW estimator tools
in our daily life, they need to be utilized with dry/non-gel
wireless EEG sensors with limited stability. Thus, the impact
of applying proper spatial filtering algorithms could be even
more pronounced in practical scenarios.
To address the aforementioned issue, we first introduce a
filter bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP) technique [13]
combined with a feature selection method to extract EEG
spatio-spectral features discriminating MW levels. Second,
we look into practical issues by conducting a comparative
study between two working memory tasks (i.e. two different
n-back tasks) with three MW levels. The brain signals were
recorded from 6 subjects using a wireless low-cost Emotiv
EPOC headset [14]. We compare the performance of the
proposed FBCSP algorithm in classification of different MW
levels with classification results obtained from EEG band
power features. The between session classification accuracies
are calculated based on different time intervals, while the
training time is kept less than 6 minutes per MW level.

II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Experimental design
In total, 6 young adults aged 19-33 years were participated in this study. All the participants gave their informed
consent to the study which had been reviewed and approved
by the ethical review board of the School of Psychology,
Trinity College Dublin, in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. The participants were asked to complete 4 sessions
of a verbal n-back task and 4 sessions of a spatial n-back
task. Each session consisted of three 2-min blocks (i.e. 0back, 1-back and 2-back). After each block, the participants
took a 12-15 seconds rest. They were also welcome to take
a break at the end of each session, if they desired. Each
block consisted of 60 trials, where each trial started by 500
ms presentation of the stimulus followed by 1500 ms inter
stimulus interval.
The verbal and the spatial n-back tasks performed in
this study were similar to the tasks introduced in [9]. In
each block of the verbal n-back task, a series of letters
was randomly presented at the center of the screen (see
Fig. 1.a). The participants were asked to remember the new
letter and respond if it was the same as the letter presented
n trials before. In total, 5 consonant English letters were
used in the verbal task. In the spatial n-back task, a white
cross was presented randomly in 5 different locations on the
screen (see Fig. 1.b). Participants were asked to compare the
current location of the cross to that occurred n trials before,
and respond if they were same. In the 0-back blocks, the
participants were only required to respond to those stimuli
(i.e. letters/locations) that were the same as the one presented
at the beginning of the block. In all the blocks, 20% of the
stimuli were targets. To reduce the learning effects, before
starting the test, the participants practiced until they reached
the satisfactory performance.

the impedance of the electrodes to a satisfactory level. The
sampling rate was 128 Hz. The recorded EEG data were
segmented to the intervals of 2, 4, and 6 s starting from the
onset of the stimuli. The segments with amplitudes exceeding
+75µV , or voltage steps of more than 150µV within a
window of 200 ms were rejected from further analysis.
C. Proposed EEG-based mental workload estimator
FBCSP is extensively used in classification of EEG-based
motor imagery data [13]. In this study, the FBCSP algorithm
was used to extract spatio-spectral features discriminating
the MW levels. Thereafter, a feature selection method was
applied to select the most discriminative set of features.
Finally, a naive bayesian classifier was used for classification.
The details about the proposed MW estimation algorithm are
as follows:
1) Multi-band spectral filtering: A filter bank was applied
to decompose the EEG data into nine equal frequency
bands, namely 4-8, 8-12, ..., 36-40 Hz. These frequency
ranges cover all the commonly used frequency bands in the
classification of MW.
2) Common spatial patterns (CSP): The EEG data from
each frequency band were spatially filtered using the CSP
filters [13]. Among various spatial filters, CSP has been
highly successful in classification of two classes of EEG data
[15]. CSP increases the discrimination between two classes
by maximizing the variance of one class while the variance
of the other class is minimized.
Let X ∈ RNc ×S denote a bandpass filtered single-trial
EEG data, where Nc and S are the number of channels and
the number of measurement samples respectively. The CSP
transformation matrix, W ∈ RNc ×Nc , linearly transforms
X as Z = WX. W is generally computed by solving the
eigenvalue decomposition problem:
C1 W = (C1 + C2 ) WD,

(b) Spatial n-back task

study

where C1 and C2 are respectively the averaged covariance
matrices of the bandpass filtered EEG data obtained from
each class; D is the diagonal matrix that contains the
eigenvalues of (C1 + C2 )−1 C1 . Usually, only the first and
the last m rows of W are used as the most discriminative
filters to perform spatial filtering [16].
3) Feature extraction: The spatio-spectrally filtered EEG
data were used to determine the features associated to each
band-pass frequency range. Based on the Ramoser formula
[16], the features of the k th trial of the EEG data belonging
to each frequency band were calculated as
T
vk = log(diag(Zk ZT
k )/trace[Zk Zk ]),

B. EEG data acquisition
EEG was acquired using an Emotiv EPOC headset [14].
The Emotiv EPOC headset is completely wireless with 14
electrodes and 2 mastoid reference electrodes. In this study,
we used 12 of the 14 available electrodes, namely F3, F4,
F7, F8, FC5, FC6, T7, T8, P7, P8, O1, O2, as well as the
two mastoid electrodes. Saline liquid was used to reduce

of the square matrix; and the superscript T denotes the
transpose of the matrix. Since we have nine frequency bands,
the total number of features for each trial was 9 × 2m. In
this study, m was set to two.
4) Feature selection: The mutual information algorithm
was used for ranking the features. Subsequently, the top

A. Behavioral performance
For the verbal and the spatial n-back tasks, we performed 3
(Difficulty: 0-back vs. 1-back vs. 2-back) × 2 (Task: verbal
vs. spatial) repeated ANOVA tests on both the error rates
and the response times. We observed significant main effects
of Difficulty on both the error rate (F (2, 15) = 8.757, p =
0.006) and the response time (F (2, 15) = 21.75, p < 0.001).
The response time increased by increasing the memory
load with averages of 0.432s, 0.515s, 0.661s respectively
for the verbal n-back task, and 0.433s, 0.515s, and 0.702s
respectively for the spatial n-back task. Similarly, the error
rate increased by increasing the difficulty with averages of
0.83%,1.5%,5.5% respectively for the verbal n-back task,
and 0.17%, 1.17% and 4.83% respectively for the spatial
n-back task. Neither Task nor the interaction between Task
and Difficulty was significant. Post-hoc tests showed that the
error rates and the response time were significantly different
in all the difficulty levels. These results suggest that the
tasks successfully induced three different MW levels in the
participants.
B. Effects of spacial filtering and feature selection on MW
estimation
To consider the effects of the proposed algorithm on the
MW estimation, four different classification models were
trained. The first model (abbreviated as FBCSP(FS)) was
obtained based on the algorithm described in Section (II-C).
Indeed, in this model, FBCSP was used to extract spatiospectral features. Thereafter, the best set of features was
selected using the proposed feature selection method. In the
second model (abbreviated as FBCSP(AllF)), all the features
obtained from FBCSP were used for classification (i.e. without any feature selection). In the third model (abbreviated
as BP(AllF)), the band power features were obtained per
each channel using the 9 frequency bands (i.e. 4-8, 8-12,...,
36-40 Hz) without applying any spacial filtering or feature
selection algorithms. In fact, these 9 frequency bands are the
same as those employed in FBCSP. BP(AllF) is similar to the
models that are commonly used in MW estimation studies
[8], [9]. In the last model (abbreviated as BP(FS)), using
the proposed feature selection method, a subset of the band
power features obtained from the third model was used for
classification. For each n-back task, the first three sessions
were used for training the classification models and the last
session was used for evaluation. The results presented in this
subsection are based on 2 seconds EEG intervals extracted
from the onset of the stimuli.
Fig. 2 shows the classification results of the four models
under the three conditions for the verbal and the spatial

selected as the most discriminative set of features for the
MV classification.

n-back tasks. All the four models achieved the classification accuracies above the chance level. This confirms the
satisfactory quality of the EEG signals recorded by the
Emotiv EPOC headset. As shown in Fig. 2, on average
FBCSP(FS) outperformed all the other models, whereas the
BP(AllF) performed the worst. Performing 4 (Models) × 3
(Difficulty: 0-back vs. 1-back vs. 2-back) repeated ANOVA
tests revealed significant main effects of the models in
the letter (F (3, 15) = 11.35, P = 0.001) and the spatial
(F (3, 15) = 4.86, p = 0.04) n-back tasks, respectively.
A close to significant main effect of Difficulty was also
observed in the letter n-back task (F (2, 10) = 4.06, p =
0.051). Importantly, Post-hoc tests showed that the proposed
FBCSP(FS) algorithm significantly performed better than
the BP(AllF) algorithm which is commonly used in MW
estimation.
Fig. 2.a shows that in the verbal task the low MW (i.e.
0-back) was separated from the high MW (2-back) with the
highest average accuracy, while the classification between
the low MW (i.e. 0-back) vs. the medium MW was (i.e. 1back) the least accurate among the other conditions. Paired
t-tests showed that the classification results of the proposed
FBCSP(FS) were significantly different between the (0- vs.
2-back) and (0- vs. 1-back) conditions (p=0.03). Unlike the
verbal n-back task, in the spatial n-back task the classification
accuracies of the proposed FBCSP(FS) are closer over the
three conditions, although still the highest accuracy obtained
in the classification of 0- vs. 2-back.
C. Effects of EEG window size
The results obtained in the previous subsection were all
based on 2 seconds EEG windows. To consider the effects
of EEG window size on the MW classification accuracy, the
performance of the proposed FBCSP(FS) algorithm was also
evaluated using longer EEG intervals (i.e. 4 and 6 seconds).
As shown in Fig. 3, the classification accuracy improved
when the EEG window size increased. Interestingly, this improvement was more pronounced in the spatial n-back task. A
repeated ANOVA test revealed a significant main effect of the
window size on the accuracy (F (2, 10) = 11.24, p = 0.003)
in the spatial n-back task. However, in the verbal n-back
task, the window size did not have a significant effect on the

accuracy (F (2, 10) = 0.34, p = 0.72). It should be noted that
longer window size means higher chance of having blinks
or muscle artifacts. Thus, due to artifact rejection, increasing
the window size leads to a smaller number of trials left
for training. This might negatively affect the results as the
accurate estimation of the CSP matrix is associated with the
training size [16]. Considering this issue, in future it should
be further investigated why increasing the window size did
not bring a large advantage for the verbal n-back task.

D. Spatial filters in different frequency bands
To better understand why the proposed algorithm improved the classification results, two spatial filters obtained
for one of the subjects were presented in Fig. 4. The spatial
filters were trained in order to get an optimum discrimination
between 0- and 2-back conditions in the letter task. As shown
in Fig. 4, the spatial filter obtained for the theta rhythm (48 Hz) gives more weights to the frontal electrodes, while
attenuates the effects of the other channels. In the same
line, the spatial filter obtained for the alpha rhythm (8-12
Hz) is more focused on the temporal and parietal electrodes,
while the effects of the other channels are mitigated. Thus,
by adding spatial filters to the MW classification algorithms,
the effects of irrelevant and redundant channels that might
be different from band to band are attenuated, and more
neurophysiologically relevant features are extracted.

using spatial filters could be crucial in improving signal to

feature selection method to extract spatio-spectral features
discriminating different mental workloads. We compared 2
representative working memory tasks: the verbal and the
spatial n-back tasks using data collected from Emotiv EPOC,
a widely used wireless EEG headset. Our experimental
results showed that the proposed spatio-spectral features
outperformed the state-of-the art algorithms in classification
of different workload conditions in both tasks. The results
also showed that spatial filters could improve the accuracy
of the MW classification algorithms by attenuating the effects
of irrelevant and redundant channels, and enhancing the
influence of the neurophysiologically relevant channels.
