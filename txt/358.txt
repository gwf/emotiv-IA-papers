Abstract
Epilepsy is largely under-diagnosed in low-income and middle-income countries, due to lack of
medical specialists and expensive electroencephalography (EEG) hardware. In this study we
investigate if low-cost consumer-grade EEG in combination with machine learning techniques
can offer a reliable screening tool to improve diagnosis rates.
We acquired brain signals in people with epilepsy (N=163) and healthy controls (N=138)
in two difficult-to-reach areas in rural Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria. Five minutes of fourteen
channel resting-state EEG data were acquired with a portable, low-cost consumer-grade EEG
recording headset. EEG channel time-series were divided in four-second artifact-free epochs and
transformed into delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma wavelet frequencies. Summary measures
such as the mean, standard deviation, minimum value and maximum value of the epoch signal
fluctuations were used to train a random forest classifier. Epilepsy diagnosis based on at least
three months seizure calendar data was used as the gold standard diagnosis. To prevent too
optimistic classification the trained model was evaluated with EEG data from subjects not used
in the training. In addition, we tested a classification model trained on Nigeria data against data
from people in Guinea-Bissau and vice versa. The most contributing data features in the EEG
were found in the beta and theta frequencies in Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria, respectively. Withincountry model performance was good with area under the receiver-operating curves of 0.85 and
0.78 (± 0.02 standard errors) in unseen data in Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria, respectively. Acrosscountry performance was moderate (0.62 and 0.64 ± 0.02).
Our data suggests that a combination of low cost electroencephalography and machine
learning techniques may facilitate diagnostic screening for epilepsy in the most remote areas of
the world.

1. Introduction
Epilepsy is a severe neurological condition with a prevalence of 65 million cases worldwide. The
reported incidence is 45 and 82 per 100,000 per year for high-income and low-middle-income
countries, respectively [1]. Even more concerning is that for many low-income and middleincome countries no incidence rate is reported, and over 90% of all people who suffer from
epilepsy in low-middle-income countries remain undiagnosed and hence untreated [1]. This is
known as the epilepsy diagnostic gap.
The epilepsy diagnostic gap can be explained by the limited diagnostic tools and health
care resources in these countries. In many of these places acquisition of clinical-grade
electroencephalography (EEG) is not available and the clinical experts to interpret the data are
few and mostly concentrated in the larger cities [2]. Furthermore, the interpretation of EEG
recordings is a challenge due to their non-stationary nature [3,4], the high inter-observer
variation in clinical scoring, and the dependency on trained clinicians [5]. Therefore, automatic
'expert-free' robust methods to perform an initial selection of individuals with high epilepsy
probability would be very useful to optimally spend the limited resources and support
community-services.
In this study we explored the potential of affordable diagnostics that circumvent
specialist-dependency, long recordings in clinical settings. To that aim we collaborated with two
epilepsy services from community-based rehabilitation (CBR) programs in rural sub-Saharan

Africa [6]. At least three months of seizure data were required prior to examination and reliable
epilepsy diagnosis. A definite diagnosis is based on follow-up data from similar calendars for at
least a year.
We investigate whether this time-consuming diagnostic procedure could be replaced by
means of several minutes functional resting-state brain data acquisition with a portable, low-cost
consumer-grade electroencephalography-recording Emotiv EPOC headset (around $600) [7–10].
This fourteen-channel headset has been introduced by the gaming industry to capture conscious
thought, emotions, facial expressions and head rotations and is comparable in signal quality to
clinical acquisitions [10].
We hypothesized that the EEG data of people with epilepsy, even in resting-state periods
with no seizures, would have a deviating ‘signature’ (in comparison to controls) that could
potentially be picked up by combining time-series features and machine learning (see Figure 1
for Infograph). We also hypothesized that these resting-state EEG deviations allow for automatic
labeling of presence or absence of epilepsy with sufficient quality to function as a potential
screening tool in resource-poor and difficult-to-reach areas.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Location
Our study was conducted at a community-based rehabilitation center in Izzi Local Government
Area, Ebonyi State, Nigeria and a similar community center in Bissorã, Oio, Guinea-Bissau.
These communities aim to reduce the burden of disabilities, including neurodisabilities such as
epilepsy. All individuals included in the study lived in the surrounding villages.

2.2 Selection of people with epilepsy
Community-based rehabilitation (CBR) programs were used to identify individuals with epilepsy
in difficult-to-reach villages. The identification was performed by CBR workers according to a
three-step approach, including 1) a general screening of the population, 2) registering of daily
seizures on a calendar for at least three months by the individual or a caretaker and 3) the clinical
evaluation of the people with epilepsy and the description of the seizures at the rehabilitation
center [11]. This approach was recently validated in one of the CBR centers [6].

2.3 Ethics
The organizational boards and the local (Secretário de Saúde Bissorã [05-16]) and the national
government (Ministério da Saúde, Bissau) approved the study in Guinea-Bissau. The local health
ministry (Izzi, Local Government Area) and the federal government (Ebonyi State House of
Assembly, Abakaliki [7-11-2016]) approved the study in Nigeria. Informed consent was
obtained from adult participants and caretakers of children below eighteen years. Control
participants were recruited from healthy caretakers and family members.

2.4 EEG acquisition
EEG data was collected in May/June 2016 in Guinea-Bissau and in September/October 2016 in
Nigeria with the same headsets (EMOTIV Inc, San Francisco, USA). The fourteen channel EEG
was configured to sample at 128 Hertz with a 16-bit resolution. Participants were asked to sit on
a chair for five minutes while wearing the wireless headset. Two sensors were preserved for
reference and grounding: the ‘common mode sense’ (CMS; located at P3) sensor was used as the
active reference for absolute referencing. The ‘driven right leg’ (DRL; located at P4) sensor was
used for feedback noise cancelation. The electrodes were located at anterofrontal (AF3, AF4, F3,
F4, F7, F8), frontocentral (FC5, FC6), occipital (O1, O2), parietal (P7, P8) and temporal sites
(T7, T8), according to the International 10–20 system. Signal quality scores are recorded for
each electrode with a range of one to five (no units), with five as best quality. Two minutes of
resting-state EEG data were recorded with closed eyes during these five minutes and used for our
study. The researcher kept a log on deviations from the experimental protocol or unusual events
that may affect the experiment. Data was stored on a Bluetooth-connected laptop.

2.5 Data cleaning and epoch selection
The data processing is summarized in Figure 2. Visual inspection of the raw signals indicated
random temporal jumps in the signal offset in a subset of the datasets. We considered these
offsets to be non-physiological and corrected them with a basic interpolation and outlier-removal
filter. We corrected for offset drifts with a four second rolling median filter.
Next, time segments of the EEG data were removed i) if the research log indicated a
deviation from the protocol, ii) if the signal quality score produced by the Emotiv device was 1
or 2 (which are labeled by Emotiv as ‘very bad’ and ‘bad’, respectively) for any of the EEG

channels, iii) or if the absolute deviation of the gyroscope signals relative to its overall median
was larger than thirty. The gyroscope value threshold of thirty was based on visual inspection of
the data, which indicated that most head movements result in a change of more than thirty. All
remaining time segments were split into four-second epochs for further wavelet analysis.

2.6 Wavelets
In line with previous studies we used multi-resolution wavelet analyses to distinguish frequency
bands in the signal [12–14]. Three wavelet types, Daubechies 2, 6 and 10, were derived to cover
the commonly used range of Daubechies d1 to d10. Next, seven wavelet levels were extracted
per wavelet type: delta (0.5–1 Hz), delta (1–2 Hz), delta (2–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–16
Hz), beta (16–32 Hz) and gamma (32–64 Hz).

2.7 Features
Features were based on the fluctuations in the epoch signal. These fluctuations are in indicator of
the amount of neural activity in the tissue underlying the EEG channel. We captured these
fluctuations with the standard deviation. This standard deviation was calculated for each
combination of wavelet type and wavelet level. Next, standard deviations were aggregated across
the fourteen channels as minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation. With this
aggregation across the channels, we expect to reduce the sensitivity of the resulting model to
specific localization of epileptic activity, which may vary between people with epilepsy. The
aggregation may also make the model less dependent on headset and sensor positioning.
The analyses were performed by either using the features, corresponding to the multiple
epochs within an individual, as input for the classification model or by first aggregating the

features (mean) per individual before feeding them into the classification model. If no
aggregation was used at this point then the classification model will give one probability of
epilepsy per epoch, which are then aggregated (mean) per individual (Figure 2).
In summary, from each person with epilepsy all available epochs were used. Per epoch of
four seconds and for each of the three wavelet types, 28 features were extracted: the four
aggregation types applied to the standard deviations in wavelet values times seven wavelet
levels. Next, these features were either aggregated per individual before or after the classification
stage (Figure 2).
Our R code and anonymized EEG data can be found online [15].

2.8 Classification models
Random forest classification models were trained using supervised learning with the R packages
randomForest (version 4.6-12) and caret (version 6.0-73). A Random forest model is an
ensemble of decisions trees, which involves making successive binary decisions via the branches
of the tree based on feature values. The advantage of using many decisions trees, being a forest,
is that it can use more input variables and it lowers the risk of overfitting towards training data
[16].
The classification model outcome was binary: epochs originating from ‘epilepsy’ or
‘control’ brains. We used the default model size of 500 decision trees. Here, the number of
candidate variables per tree was tuned by random search, using three draws. Features per split
were selected with the Gini index, representing the node purity or importance. Finally, accuracy
was used as performance metric in five-fold cross-validation. No information about the
participants other than the EEG recording was used in the classification process.

2.9 Classifier training and evaluation
Models were trained separately for the Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria study population. Models
were trained and validated with each of the d2, d6 and d10 wavelet type, leading to a total of
twelve Random forest models (2 countries × 2 aggregation options × 3 wavelet types). Here,
participants were randomly allocated to a validation set (ten participants with epilepsy and ten
controls), a test set (ten and ten), and a training set with the remaining participants. Data from
participants was not shared between these three datasets.
Each model was trained in the training set and then evaluated in the validation set. The
best performing wavelet type in the validation set was used to train the classifier one more time
on the pooled training and validation set. Best model performance in the validation set was
defined based on classification accuracy. If the accuracy was equal between models, the
performance was based on – in this order – the Cohen’s kappa coefficient, area under the
precision-recall curve, and or sensitivity. Finally, the best model from the validation set was
evaluated in the test set, both in the same country and the test set from the other country.
Subset selections were repeated with eleven unique seeds (R seed: 100 to 600 with steps
of 50, and identical between conditions) to bootstrap performance estimates in the test set.
Additionally, variable importance was evaluated using the decrease in Gini score per feature.
Logistic regression was used to test for associations between binary classification success
and sex, age, and data quality. A P value < 0.05 was considered significant.

3. Results
3.1 Participant characteristics
A total of 97 individuals from Guinea-Bissau and 212 from Nigeria enrolled in the study.
Demographics of the participants corresponding to the data used are shown in Table 1.

3.2 Data quality
The data acquired in Guinea-Bissau had slightly lower quality compared to the data acquired in
Nigeria. The average minimum Emotiv data quality score across the channels was: 4 (very good)
in 97% and 80% of the Nigerian and Guinea-Bissau data, respectively and 3 (good) in 3% and
18% of the of the Nigerian and Guinea-Bissau data respectively. No difference was found in the
proportion of data with quality score 1 (very bad) or 2 (bad) between the countries. The overall
quality score produced by the Emotiv headset on the sensor impedance quality was slightly lower
in Guinea-Bissau (average: 305±11) in comparison to Nigeria (average 310±20).
The proportion of the remaining data for which artifacts were detected using our own
algorithm was 39% and 15% in the Guinea-Bissau and Nigerian data, respectively. In Nigeria
data for eight individuals were excluded as we could not select epochs due to too much signal
artifacts.

3.3 Classification performance
We found good classification model performance in both countries (Table 2). Classification
performance within the country of model training was equal or higher in Guinea-Bissau than in
Nigeria. The performance of models trained with data from one country and evaluated on data
from the other country was lower on all performance metrics, except sensitivity. No clear

performance difference was found between the scenarios of window aggregation before or after
the classification stage (Table 2).

3.4 Feature importance
Different features were important for model performance if compared between countries (Figure
3). Features based on the minimum of the standard deviation across channels were more
prominent in the Guinea-Bissau models, whereas the mean standard deviation across channels in
the theta band was most prominent in the Nigerian models. Differences were less pronounced
when epochs were aggregated before the classification stage (Figure 3).

3.5 Associations with classifications
No significant associations were found between classification success and sex, age, quality
scores or proportion of data with artifacts.

4. Discussion
Our study demonstrates the potential of low cost electroencephalography to close the epilepsy
diagnostic gap in difficult to reach areas in low-income and middle-income countries. The
achieved within-country model performance suggests potential utility in large scale communitybased screening efforts in resource-poor conditions. That is, screening in the absence of clinical
experts and expensive EEG hardware. A relatively large sample size with a heterogeneous
demography, acquired at multiple testing sites, outside a clinical setting, supports the robustness
of our findings. The across-country performance was moderate suggesting the need for withincountry optimalization.

Our approach have several advantages. The classification is based on only a few minutes
of resting-state acquisition in the populations’ environment, whereas seizure calendar approaches
currently in use to diagnose epilepsy in resource poor settings often take weeks to several months
and requires multiple home visits by CBR workers. A second advantage is the use of easy
accessible wireless EEG recordings, which do not rely on trained personal and expensive
hardware. By using machine learning techniques, the data evaluation becomes less dependent on
the direct availability of clinical experts. This screening tool is not intended to replace human
experts. Rather, they could be used to preselect high-risk individuals for follow-up medical
treatment in places where experts are lacking.
Our study has limitations. Noise levels and artifacts varied between countries. Possible
sources of these differences may include various environmental factors, such as humidity,
sunlight exposure, background noise, mobile phones signals, and random signal dropouts during
the wireless ‘on the spot’ recordings. Further research is needed to establish the reasons for
differences between locations and to develop machine learning approaches that can deal with this
variation. Second, our analysis was based on channel-only signal characteristics. More
information may be captured with brain-topology preserving metrics such as dynamic graphs or
spectral brain images [17]. Furthermore, our current models are optimized based on classification
accuracy. Given that we want to optimize the number of detected individuals with epilepsy, an
optimization based on sensitivity may be more effective. However, in order to avoid a large
number of false positives, we think the first focus should be on improving overall discriminative
ability via the pathways as outlined above. Aggregating feature values from repeated measures
within individuals before classification did not result in systematic higher performance. In
theory, aggregating probabilities after the classification may fit better with a possible nonlinear

relationship between feature value and epilepsy probability, while aggregation by averaging
features may reduce the influence of measurement error. The current results seem to favor
aggregating as this substantially speeds up the model training procedure without a clear visual
drop in performance. The present study is a proof of concept and intended to guide further work.
Before we can recommend clinical implementation a better generalizability and more insight into
the sources of error will be needed. Finally, in the latest upgrade of the the Emotiv hardware
(EPOC+) the offline data storage of raw EEG signal has been disabled and users are required to
store the data in their Emotiv cloud service which requires internet connections during recording.
This is not compatible with the resource poor settings used in our study. Therefore, it is
important that alternative systems are developed and explored, that rely on open hard- and
software, e.g. initiatives such as OpenEEG [18] and the affordable OpenBCI hardware project
[19].
In conclusion, low cost brain recordings in combination with automatic time-series
modeling may bring diagnostic capabilities to resource poor settings. As recently mentioned in a
compelling review, the proliferation of Internet and smartphones in resource poor settings can
increase health care access through so-called teleneurology [20]. Cooperation with local partners
is essential for its success. A recent study has shown the potential impact of teleneurology for
diagnosing epilepsy, using wireless consumer-grade EEG recordings [21]. We believe that our
experience could be another step forward in this innovative field and may stimulate other
contributions that may help to close the epilepsy diagnostic gap in regions where the burden of
this disabling disease is highest.

Figure 1: Infograph of the study flow. Two independent cohorts of people are included from
community based rehabilitation centers in rural Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria with resting-state
ate
EEG recordings in all subjects. People are followed over time. The definite epilepsy diagnosis in
the people suspected of epilepsy is determined by means of seizure calendars during follow-up
up
and used as gold standard data for model training. EEG recordings are filtered at channel level in
different frequency bands and devided in multiple epochs. Epochs are characterized by simple
le
features: the mean, minimum, maximum and standard devation of the signal. EEG classifiers,
rs,
which allow prediction of presence or absence of epilepsy, are constructed from these features
res
and validated with unseen data within countries and across countries.

Figure 3: Importance of each signal feature. Values of frequency importance (i.e. decrease in
Gini index) in the model performance for the Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau (GB) cohort. Values are
determined for the ‘mean’, ‘minimum’, ‘maximum’ and ‘standard deviation’ of the EEG signal
at individual epoch level (‘no aggregation’) or with the epoch features aggregated per participant.
The frequency bands are plotted on the x-axis from high-frequency Gamma at the left to
increasingly lower frequencies to the right. Errorbars represent the 95% confidence intervals.
