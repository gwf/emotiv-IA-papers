Abstract. Fatigue during driving is the main contributing factor to road
accidents. It is influenced by time on task (TOT) and time of day (TOD). Recent
electroencephalogram (EEG) research on fatigue assessment has shown a
promising result in explaining the fatigue phenomenon. However, different
findings exist regarding the best EEG parameters related to fatigue. This study
examined EEG changes according to the effect of TOT and TOD and determined
the best parameters to distinguish fatigue status. To generate driver fatigue,
prolonged driving in the morning and at night in a simulator was conducted. The
EEG signal was collected from 28 male participants at frontal and occipital
areas. The EEG power (brainwave) was determined from the first and last 5
minutes of the driving task and after a break of 30 minutes. The results of this
study showed a general tendency of EEG power changing throughout the driving
sessions. However, changes related to fatigue were only found for the night
sessions, as confirmed by θ power and the subjective fatigue measurement result.
This study showed that TOT (as a factor that induces fatigue) was explained by θ
from the frontal area, whereas TOD was differentiated by α, θ, θ/β, (θ+α)/β and
(θ+α)/(β+α).
Keywords: EEG; fatigue; sleepiness; simulated driving; time on task; time of day.

Introduction

Road traffic accidents are a major concern in many industrialized and
developing nations. Fatigue among drivers is a prevalent phenomenon and is
considered a major contributing factor in many traffic accidents [1]. Fatigued
drivers tend to exhibit diminished awareness, resulting in poor judgment in
performing tasks in outside environments [2]. Fatigue is also highly associated
with reduced cognitive and decision-making performance [3]. Driving is a
complex task that can be categorized as a cognitive task rather than a physical
task. During driving, driver fatigue is mainly characterized by drowsiness and
mental fatigue [4].
According to reports in the literature, physiological changes can be measured as
fatigue indicators using both subjective and objective tools [5,6]. The subjective

tools attempt to capture self-perception of the sleepiness/fatigue level at a
certain time based on standardized questionnaires, such as the Karolinska
Sleepiness Scale (KSS), the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), the Epworth
Sleepiness Scale (EPS), the Fatigue Visual Analogue Scale (F-VAS), the
Fatigue Rating, and the Swedish Occupational Fatigue Index (SOFI) [6-11].
The objective tools involve the use of updated technology to assess fatigue [12].
The technology used records physiological changes to observe fluctuation in
fatigue indicators. Among the various approaches available in the literature,
electroencephalogram (EEG) is considered an objective and valid method for
evaluating fatigue [13-15]. These studies used EEGs in conjunction with several
subjective measures to establish the level of fatigue and also as confirmatory
test of the EEG results.
It is noteworthy that, to date, research addressing EEG changes as a function of
different driving conditions related to fatigue, including comparison of driving
during the day (i.e. morning) and at night, is fairly limited. In particular, it
remains unclear which parameters can provide a better understanding of fatigue
in relation to prolonged driving and time of day. Furthermore, a comparison of
EEG signals from different brain areas is needed to understand the results of
existing studies related to fatigue. In this study, the occipital (highly related to
visual function) and frontal (highly related to cognitive function) brain areas
were compared. This study attempted to quantify the changes in EEG
parameters during driving with the main objective to determine the best EEG
parameters to describe changes in fatigue status. Prolonged driving and time of
day (TOD) were used as the independent variables that induce fatigue.

Method

2.1

Subjects

Twenty-eight male participants (M ± SD of age 26.36 ± 4.59 years, height
168.56 ± 2.52 cm, and weight 71.69 ± 15.35 kg) were recruited in this
experiment. Male participants were chosen because most commercial drivers
are male; this strategy was also adopted by Kar, et al. [13], Kee, et al. [16] and
Tanaka, et al. [17]. Half of the participants were assigned to morning driving
sessions (07:00) and the other half were assigned to night driving sessions
(21:00). Each driving session lasted 2.5 h. All participants had a valid driver’s
license, had been drivers for at least two years, and were familiar with long
duration driving conditions. The participants were asked to sleep for
approximately 8 h and then wake up in the following morning at around 04:3005:00. A heavy meal (450-550 kcals) was provided for the participants roughly
an hour before the experiment commenced. The number of calories was

292

Rida Zuraida, et al.

determined and calculated based on The Balanced Nutrition Guidelines 2014
from the Indonesian Ministry of Health [18].
The night participants were informed that they were allowed to continue to
perform normal activities without taking a nap and were permitted to perform
only light physical work during the day. To ensure that the participants followed
the instructions, after finishing the meal, all participants were interviewed
regarding their daytime activities. If there was an indication that the participant
had not followed the instructions, the experiment on that day was canceled and
the experiment was rescheduled.
The number of participants (14 participants for each driving session, 28 in total)
was considered sufficient for the study according to the value of the effect size d
= 1.25 with power 0.8, which requires a minimum sample size of 12 [19]. No
alcoholic or caffeinated beverages were allowed within 24 h before (and
throughout) the experiment. A brief interview and blood pressure measurement
were performed to ensure that the participants were fit and ready for the
experiment. The systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure
(DBP) of all participants did not exceed 120/80mmHg during the experiments.
Note that the participants provided their written informed consent prior to the
experiment and were paid for their time.

2.2

Tasks Design

The design of this research study involved 150 minutes (2.5 h) of driving for
both types of driving sessions (morning and night) to induce fatigue from
prolonged driving. The driving duration was considered prolonged when it took
at least 120 minutes [20], although other researchers set 150-180 minutes as the
prolonged driving threshold [16,21]. The route chosen for this simulation was a
loop track comprising of freeways and city streets, as provided by the driving
simulation software used, City Car Driving Simulator v.1.4, which is commonly
used in driving simulation studies (e.g., Almahasneh, et al. [22]). The traffic
density was set at 80% and the suggested driving speed was in the range of 40
to 60 km/hour.
The simulator in this study comprised of a set of standard sound systems with
an external stereo speaker (Hewlett Packard), which was used to generate the
engine sound, and a set of Logitech G27 series 92 steering wheels (USA) with
three pedals and manual controls that were integrated with a PC (Intel i7
processor, 4GB of RAM and 2GB of VGA card). The simulator was located
inside a room with the temperature set at 22 °C.

EEG data collection

Electroencephalography or EEG (Emotiv Epoch, USA) was utilized in
recording the brain activities during the experiments. The EEG signals were
obtained from eight channels for the frontal area and two channels for the
occipital area with a sampling frequency of 128 Hz [16]. The EEG signal was
recorded during the experiments to minimize the interruption of tasks caused by
the EEG installment process; only signals from the first and last 5 minutes of
the driving sessions and 5 minutes after the 30-minute break from the driving
task were analyzed in this study [23].

Note: S1 = first 5 min, S2 = last 5 min before end, S3 = 5 min after 30-min break, Ch = channel (1-10) ((1 =
AF3, 2 = AF4, 3 = F7, 4 = F8, 5 = F3; 6 = F8, 7 = FC5, 8 = FC6, 9 = O1, 10 = O2); Rk(1-2) (1 = Frontal, 2 =
Occipital), P = Power Spectral Density; SOFI: Swedish Occupational Fatigue Index, KSS = Karolinska
Sleepiness Scale

Figure 1 Data collection and analysis.

The signals (stored in edf. files) were later extracted using eeglab’s module in
MATLAB (see Figure 1). Each of the EEG signals was band-pass filtered to
eliminate undesired signal frequencies below 0.5 Hz and above 32 Hz [24].
Signal decomposition was applied to acquire the 1-minute power spectral
density (PSD) values of the θ wave (4-8 Hz), α wave (8-13 Hz), and the β wave
(13-25 Hz), which were later converted to dB units. Each brain wave in the
form of EEG parameters was represented by the mean value of the 5-min PSDs.
Additionally, following Jap, et al. [14], the EEG parameters of four ratios of
brainwaves (θ/β, θ/(α+β), (θ+α)/β, and (θ+α)/(α+β)) were also analyzed.

Subjective Data Collection

To augment the EEG measurement, some subjective fatigue and sleepiness tools
were applied. The tools were applied to confirm that the driving tasks induced
the participants’ fatigue. The subjective measurements were SOFI [11], the KSS
[7-8], and the subjective Fatigue Rating [9-10]. SOFI was applied to measure
the subjective fatigue before and after driving using a scale of 0 = not at all to 6
= very high degree, with 3 as an intermediary level. Of the five SOFI
dimensions, the sleepiness dimension was not measured to avoid repetition of
the questions of sleepiness level asked using KSS.
The KSS, as a tool to measure sleepiness, is based on a scale of 1 = very alert to
9 = very sleepy, fighting sleep, an effort to keep awake, with 5 as a neutral
condition [8]; the KSS value was collected before the experiment started and
every 10 minutes during the experiments. The Subjective Fatigue rating uses a 0
to 10 scale [10]. In the scale, 0 = none and 10 = worst possible fatigue, with 5 =
moderate fatigue as the intermediary level. The data were collected immediately
before the experiment started, before the driving task ended, and after
participants had a break of 30 minutes.

2.5

Data Analysis

All EEG parameters were tested using repeated measures ANOVA to determine
any significant changes between the first 5 minutes, last 5 minutes, and 5
minutes after the 30-minute break from the driving task. Analysis was
conducted for each session (morning and night). In addition, a comparison test
was conducted between sessions using one-way ANOVA to identify any
significant differences.
Data from the subjective tools were used to establish the level of fatigue from
EEG parameters changes. To study the effect of duration and TOD of the
subjective data result, a Wilcoxon test was used on the score obtained on the
SOFI, KSS, and Subjective Fatigue rating scales. A significance level of α =
5% was applied for the tests.

EEG Data Collection

For both sessions, the EEG was observed for changes throughout the driving
sessions. In the morning sessions, the three EEG parameters (θ, α, and β wave
power) demonstrated an increasing pattern throughout the driving duration. This
phenomenon existed for both the frontal and occipital areas. Changes in the θ

EEG Changes Analysis during Prolonged Simulated Driving 295

wave power appeared to be consistent for both areas (6-7%), whereas changes
in the β wave power were only observed for the occipital area (10%). The
power ratios from the additional four parameters tended to increase after 2.5 h
of driving. However, a slight (3-4%) change occurred only for the frontal area.
It is noteworthy that all these changes were not significant, except for the θ/β
parameter (p < 0.05) from the occipital area (Figure 2).

Figure 2 EEG parameters from frontal and occipital areas, and subjective
measurements.

The night driving sessions resulted in somewhat different patterns. The β and θ
wave power tended to increase for the frontal area (4-8%). For the occipital
area, the three waves increased substantially (8-12%), with the greatest changes
observed for the θ wave power. For these sessions, the power ratios
demonstrated a consistent increase for both areas (1-6%). However, only
changes of the θ power from the frontal and occipital area were significant (p <
0.01) (Table 1).
Comparisons were also made between the EEG powers of the morning and
night driving sessions. Significant changes in the EEG (from the frontal area)
were observed for almost all parameters (Table 1). For instance, the differences
for the frontal area (for α, β, and θ waves power) were in the order of 18 to
22%. In contrast, changes in the EEG (from the occipital area) were only
observed for the α wave (p < 0.05) and θ wave (p < 0.01). Regardless of the

296

parameters and brain areas, the night driving sessions were generally
characterized by greater EEG power.

Subjective Fatigue Changes

The result obtained from SOFI suggests that the fatigue level of the participants
was increased after the experiment. However, the participants were not yet in a
tired condition after driving for 2.5 h, except for those in the night sessions. The
average SOFI scores for physical exertion (PD), lack of motivation (LM), lack
of energy (LE), and physical discomfort (PD) after the experiment for the
morning sessions were 0.52 ± 0.63, 0.48 ± 0.52, 0.75 ± 0.84, and 1.04 ± 1.15,
respectively, i.e. all below 3, whereas for the night sessions, the average SOFI
scores for PD, LM, LE, and PD were 1.65 ± 1.33, 3.02 ± 1.49, 3.73 ± 1.05, and
3.00 ± 1.07, respectively. These results demonstrate that the morning sessions
resulted in significantly increased scores (p < 0.05) only for the LE and PD
dimensions, whereas the night sessions resulted in significantly increased scores
for all dimensions (p < 0.05).
The second subjective set of data accompanying the EEG result is the subjective
sleepiness of KSS. This study showed that the KSS scores generally increased
throughout the driving sessions. The average final scores after the driving tasks
were approximately 3.6 for the morning sessions and 7.1 for the night sessions

EEG Changes Analysis during Prolonged Simulated Driving 297

(scale 1-9), with only the night sessions corresponding to sleepiness level
greater than 5 (neither alert nor sleepy). There were no differences with respect
to the level of subjective sleepiness (KSS scores) of the morning sessions, but a
difference was found (p < 0.05) for the night sessions. Similar to the SOFI
result, this KSS score showed that fatigue had not occurred yet after driving in
the morning, whereas the opposite results were observed for the night driving
sessions. After resting for 30 minutes, the KSS scores during 5 minutes of
driving decreased to approximately 3 for the morning sessions and 5 for the
night sessions.
Similar to the KSS scores, the Subjective Fatigue rating also indicated an
increasing trend throughout the driving duration, with no observed differences
between the initial ratings from the morning. At the end of the session, an
average rating of 4 and 7 (scale 0-10) was observed for the morning and night
driving sessions, respectively, with only the night sessions categorized as
sessions in which fatigue occurred. The 30-minute break resulted in lower
fatigue scores: 25% for the morning sessions and 22% for the night sessions.
Based on these subjective results, the significant EEG changes at the night
session and the differences between EEG parameters between the morning and
night sessions were related to fatigue. This participants’ fatigue condition was
confirmed by the increasing KSS and the Subjective Fatigue rating score.

Discussion

The findings of study demonstrate that several EEG parameters tend to increase
marginally throughout a 2.5 h driving duration. The driving tasks result in a
substantial increase in the level of sleepiness and perceived fatigue, particularly
for night driving.
With respect to the PSD of the EEG parameters, significant changes were only
observed for the θ/β parameter (for the morning sessions) and the θ parameter
(for the night sessions). It seems that the duration employed in the experiment
might have been inadequate for providing more substantial effects. These
changes were not always consistent across brain areas. Changes in the θ/β
parameter were observed from the occipital area, whereas an increase in θ
power was found from the frontal and occipital area. The latter, in particular,
was also reported by Trejo, et al. [25], a phenomenon that may indicate acute
fatigue [26]. Although the increases in θ and β power in this study were only
marginal, these phenomena have also been reported in several other studies (e.g.
Otmani, et al. [26] and Tanaka, et al. [27]). The power of brainwave changes
observed from the frontal and occipital areas could indicate an increase in

298

Rida Zuraida, et al.

mental fatigue [25]. Note that increases in α and θ power that are
simultaneously observed with a decrease in β power have been used to indicate
intense fatigue, resulting in a marked decrease in awareness [28]. An increase in
β power at the beginning of a cognitive task has been interpreted as increased
mental demand [29]. The findings of this study, however, do not indicate
substantial changes in β power.
It is worth mentioning that there is no agreement in the literature regarding
which brain waves (and which brain areas) provide consistent changes. For
example, a decrease in α power could also indicate fatigue. Such an increase
has been reported by Trejo, et al. [24], although the signals were obtained from
the parietal area. As indicated by Tanaka, et al. [27], inconsistent changes in the
α power could actually indicate different subjective feelings (sleepiness or
fatigue). Changes in EEG parameters as a function of fatigue have been
reported by Craig, et al. and Ma, et al. [29,30] and, to some extent, are in line
with the results of this study. The results of this study, however, are in contrast
to those reported by Jap, et al. [14] and Puspasari, et al. [31]
Another important finding here is the fact that the power of all EEG parameters
for the night driving sessions was substantially greater than those obtained from
the morning driving sessions. This difference is particularly true for the
brainwave power obtained from the frontal brain area. For the brainwaves from
the occipital area, greater power was only found for the α and θ waves.
It should be noted that it is somewhat difficult to determine whether the results
mentioned above are associated with TOD (circadian) effects [32] or with the
fact that the drivers were awake for a substantially longer duration (time awake
factor). A report by Williamson, et al. [4] indicated the role of both factors in
relating fatigue and safety. From this study, the result confirmed the findings of
a prior research in which the brain changes significantly as a person becomes
fatigued. Furthermore, in determining the best EEG parameters related to
fatigue, the research indicated that the θ waves obtained from the frontal lobe
changed significantly according to the effect of driving duration. The impact of
the time of day, although it may be influenced by other factors, is indicated by
significant changes of the α and θ waves at the frontal and occipital areas. Other
significant changes were found in the β power, θ/β, (θ+α)/β, and (θ+α)/(β+α),
but only in the frontal area. These results were similar to the results of the study
by Jap, et al. [16] regarding the use of brainwave ratios obtained from the
frontal area.

Conclusion

The objective of this study was is to examine the changes in EEG activity in
order to obtain the best EEG parameters related to fatigue. By considering
prolonged driving duration and TOD as independent variables that induce
fatigue, it was concluded that both morning and night driving tasks for 2.5 h
only result in marginal EEG changes. The driving tasks, however, were
sufficient in producing an increased level of sleepiness and fatigue. It is also
concluded that night driving is characterized by substantially greater EEG
power, particularly for the frontal area. A synchronization process due to lack of
light during night sessions may have affected the change in θ wave power
compared to during the morning sessions, and this same process could also
increase the participants’ fatigue level.
The EEG parameters that changed significantly over the driving time were the θ
wave from the frontal and occipital areas during night sessions, and θ/β from
the occipital area during morning sessions. The θ wave power changes also
explain the effect of TOD together with the other four EEG parameters (α, θ/β,
(θ+α)/β, (θ+α)/(β+α). In this study, the consistent changes of θ and θ/β
indicate that the use of these two parameters to detect fatigue is more promising
than the use of the other EEG parameters. Results from comparison between
different areas of the brain have frequently been discussed; however, less
discussed is the frontal area, which is suggested as the most suitable brain area
from which to obtain EEG data related to fatigue.

6

Study Limitations

Based on the study result, more than 2.5 h of driving is required to trigger
severe driver fatigue (see the result of the morning sessions). However, a
promising result of this study is that the θ and θ/β powers are more sensitive
toward driver fatigue changes compared to other EEG parameters.
