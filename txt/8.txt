ABSTRACT
This paper deals with the issue of the brain-computer interface (BCI) – the human-machine interface (HMI) based on
acquisition, analysis and transformation of signals generated by the central nervous system (CNS) as the manifestation of its normal
function. Brain-computer interface can be seen as the bridge that is building up direct one-way or two-way communication pathway
between the brain and the external technical device. Paper introduces techniques based on non-invasive functional imaging of the
brain used for data acquisition in non-invasive brain computer interfaces, and is focused on the technique that is reading neural
activity of the brain with use of multi-channel electroencephalograph (EEG). As the part of this paper we are introducing our
experience with the low-cost commercially available equipment Emotiv EPOC Neuroheadset based on this technology.

Keywords: user interface, Brain Computer Interface, BCI, functional brain imaging, multi-channel electroencephalograph, EEG,

1. INTRODUCTION
Brain-computer interface (BCI) research, as the
interdisciplinary field on the borders of biology, medicine
and informatics, has attracted a lot of attention of
scientific community in recent years.
Brain-computer interface is often evaluated as the
potential part of the equipment able to improve life of the
significant number of people with different motor or voice
communication disabilities or with completely paralyzed
voluntary muscles, which are caused by degenerative
diseases or accidents.
Brain-computer interfaces have the potential to build
up new communication interface for assistive
technologies, including wheelchair control, environment
control, various smart home assistive applications or
control of personal computers and software applications
including web browsers, typewriters, computer spellers or
computer games [1][2][3].
BCIs are often focused on neuroprosthetics
applications that are aimed at repair and restoration of
damaged hearing, sight or movement. It can be seen as the
part of the narrower class of neuroprosthetics, because of
brain-computer interface definition, based on the requisite
of the direct connection between neuroprosthesis and the
central nervous system (CNS). BCIs can be considered as
the part of neurorehabilitation tools because of the neural
plasticity of human brain [4].
Crossing the boundaries of medical applications,
brain-computer interfaces can be used for smart home
applications intended as the enhancements of life quality
and have been evaluated as the interfaces that allow
control of various equipments including mobile robots,
robotic arms, flying drones or as the interfaces that allows
driving a car [5].
Attention is paid to the possibility to use it as the new
user interface of personal computer and entertainment
industry is evaluating the potential of the use in recreation
including various forms of computer games and virtual
reality applications [6].

Brain-computer interface or mind-machine interface
(MMI) or brain-machine interface (BMI) is the humanmachine interface (HMI) that can be defined as the system
able to translate subject’s intent or thoughts into the
technical control signals without the use of the
communication channel based on the use of the speech or
any other neuromuscular activity. BCI is building direct
communication pathway between the human brain and the
computer or external technical device in general with aim
to build one-way or two-way communication interface.
The key components of brain-computer interface
systems are data acquisition hardware based on the
monitoring of signals produced as the manifestation of
normal activity of the central nervous system and software
component that is analysing acquired signals and is
extracting features that can be translated into the technical
control signals appropriate for use in control of the
external technical device.
Brain-computer interfaces are forming three main
groups according to the invasivity to the body of users.
Invasive brain-computer interfaces are surgically
implanted directly into the brain, and are often based on
the use of arrays of microelectrodes implanted into the
motor or visual cortex. Invasive brain-computer interfaces
are able to provide best temporal and spatial resolution of
signals. Partially invasive brain-computer interfaces are
locating arrays of microelectrodes inside the skull but not
inside the brain. Electrocorticography (ECoG) is the
example of this technique.
Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces are based on
the functional brain imaging techniques, mostly on multichannel electroencephalography (EEG). Although noninvasive BCIs are providing the lowest accuracy in the
signal acquisition, because of the deflection caused by the
skull, there is advantage in no modification of the human
body and minimal discomfort for the user of the interface.
It is possible to implement non-invasive brain-computer
interfaces under the most naturalistic conditions of use
with minimal need of the wearable hardware and with
advantage of wireless connection to the host computer that

Data Acquisition in Non-Invasive Brain-Computer Interface Using Emotiv EPOC Neuroheadset

is analyzing and transforming signals or to the technical
device that is controlled with use of brain-computer
interface.
2. BRAIN IMAGING TECHNIQUES
The key component of the BCI is the data acquisition
hardware intended for monitoring of the manifestation of
normal neural activity of the central nervous system. Data
acquisition in non-invasive brain-computer interface is
based on the brain imaging and this category includes
various techniques that are capable directly or indirectly
image the structure (structural brain imaging) and
function (functional brain imaging) of the brain.

electrical signals scanned from large groups of neurons.
This technique is frequently used in research and
development aimed at creation of the BCI, because the
process of its use is non-invasive for the user. Another
advantage is that the EEG is capable of high temporal
resolution with measurement of electrical activity of the
brain on the level of milliseconds.
All of described techniques have its limitations and
differ in advantages and disadvantages. For example
MEG, or EEG, which measure neural activity of the brain
with high temporal resolution, are limited in ability of
spatial resolution and fMRI with its high capability of the
localization of neural activity has disadvantage because of
its lower temporal resolution.

2.1. Structural brain imaging
Structural brain imaging deals with the imaging of the
brain structure and there is possibility to use it for
diagnostic purpose in the case of intracranial diseases
including tumours and in case of various injuries.
Computed Tomography (CT) or Computerized Axial
Tomography (CAT) uses series of x-ray images of head
taken from various directions and creates cross-sectional
images of the brain.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) uses magnetic
fields and radio waves to acquire data for formation of
two- or three-dimensional images of the brain. MRI has
advantage in no use of ionizing radiation or radioactive
tracers.

3. EMOTIV EPOC NEUROHEADSET
In our effort to build novel application of the braincomputer interface we are using low-cost commercially
available 14 channel EEG hardware Emotiv EPOC
Neuroheadset (Fig. 1), which is used for acquisition of
raw data from electrodes that are positioned at AF3, F7,
F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8 and AF4
positions, according to the international 10-20 system.
Odd numbers of electrodes are reserved for left
hemisphere of the brain; even numbers of electrodes are
reserved for right hemisphere of the brain.

2.2. Functional brain imaging
Functional imaging of the brain is used for diagnostic
purpose in case of metabolic diseases and lesions and it is
also suitable group of techniques that can be used for
neurological and cognitive psychology and for the
creation of brain-computer interfaces.
Positron Emission Tomography (PET), using trace
amounts of short-lived radioactive materials, Single
Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), using
gama-ray emitting radioisotopes, functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Near Infrared
Spectroscopic Imaging (NIRSI) are techniques that
measure and localise changes in cerebral blood flow,
which are related to the neural activity and it is possible to
use it for identification of regions of the brain, which are
activated when subject is performing particular tasks.
Other imaging techniques, including the magnetoencephalography (MEG) used for both research and
clinical purpose, electrocorticography (ECoG) and
electroencephalography (EEG) are suitable techniques for
recording of changes in electrical currents and magnetic
fields, which are produced as the manifestation of the
normal function of the brain.
Electroencephalography (EEG) can be defined as the
measurement of the electrical activity of the brain, realised
by recording of electrical signals scanned by electrodes,
which are placed on the scalp.
The result of measurement, which is called
electroencephalogram (EEG), represents the set of

Electrodes AF3, AF4, F3, F4, F7 and F8 are used for
imaging of neural activity of the lobus frontalis of the
subject’s brain. Electrodes FC5, FC6, T7 and T8 are
scanning the lobus temporalis of the brain. The lobus
parietalis is scanned by P7 and P8 electrodes. Neural
activity of the lobus occipitalis is scanned with use of the
O1 and O2 electrodes (Fig. 2).
Two referencing electrodes CMS (on the left side) and
DRL (on the right side) are used for reduction of noise in
signal.

Signals are sampled with 128 Hz sampling rate and are
sent through the wireless connection to the dongle, which
is used as a receiver connected to the USB port of
personal computer. Host computer is used to perform
computationally expensive analysis of acquired data and
transformation into the control signals for software
applications.
There is possibility to find characteristic patterns in
EEG signals that are connected with facial expressions
including blink, right or left wink, right or left look, raise
or furrow of brow, smile, teeth clench, right or left smirk
and laugh and those patterns are, according to tests
provided as the part of our research, recognizable in
signals from respective electrodes.
For example, look left or right is manifesting mostly in
signals from F7 and F8 electrodes and also in signals from
FC5, O2, P8, FC6 and AF4 as shown in Table 1.

Affections of the subject are also manifesting in EEG
signals and there is possibility to detect characteristic
patterns for engagement, boredom, frustration, meditation,
instantaneous excitement or long term excitement, which
are connected to the vigilance, alertness, concentration,
stimulation, interest, contemplation, expectation or
negative feelings.
Intentions of the subject to push, pull, move left, right,
up and down and to rotate clockwise, counterclockwise,
left, right, forward and backward are detectable. Intents
are connected with real life or virtual objects. In case of
virtual objects there is possibility to detect intent of the
subject to let those objects disappear.
The ability to control external technical device is
determined by the capability of proper level of
concentration of the subject during the process of signal
scanning.
