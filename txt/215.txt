INTRODUCTION

In literature, we find four types of drowsiness:
sleepiness, hardly force, period of day and physical
annoying. Extremely engaged to finish their works along
the day, persons do not possess occasion to obtain
sufficient relax. Since an experiment to hold attentive,
they can usually camp to caffeine or another energizers.
Thus, standing attentive longer than one day, the person
may not be apt to gate it more which will provoke its
failure and abnormally affect the body. In addition, the
body brain is recorded form on epochs of day
circumstance. Indeed, it controls the person and monitors
the epochs when it must be dormant or be attentive.
Usually, these epochs will be influenced by downing and
darkness. Hence, continuing the epoch attentive
negatively influences the person [3]. In addition, the
physical aspect is interested; we can affIrm that we fmd
persons who have physical sickness that can conduct to
drowsiness position. One more, being anxious or starved
may conduct the driver to land drowsiness state [4].
It is common to say that EEG is the most important
and useful technique used to measure and capture the brain
signals because of its great temporal resolution,
noninvasiveness, and low set-up costs. In fact, your brain

is the boss of your body. It runs the show and controls just
about everything you do, what you think and feel, how you
learn and remember, and the way you move and talk, the
beating of your heart, the digestion of your food, and yes,
even the amount of stress you feel. Then the nervous
system is like a network that relays messages back and
forth from the brain to different parts of the body and
governs the activities of different organs of the body.

A. Electroencephalographic signals
As the characteristic patterns of the electrical potentials
can change from one state to another. Considering
everything they do, EEG helps to show in what state the
person is whether slhe is happy, nervous, even asleep ...
epilepsy and brain computer interface (BCI) are mostly the
important parts of EEG. Seizure can be defined as the
transient of weird and unusual behavior of neurons within
one or several neural networks, which restricts the
patients' physical and mental activities. Yet, EEG has a
focal role in nervous electro-physiology area such as using
spike wave in order to discover diagnose epilepsy, brain
tumor early, sleep analysis and monitor the depth of
anesthesia etc.
In literature, brain signals are generally employed to
evaluate drowsiness is termed the Electroencephalogram.
This signal possesses various frequency waves, containing
the delta band which is associated to sleep position, the
theta band which describes to drowsiness. Relaxation is
defined by the alpha band and the alertness is described
by the beta band. The decrement of the alpha band and
the increment in the theta frequency, express drowsiness
[5].

By Analyzing of Table I, we remarks that The Theta
activity is concerned for drowsy driving recognition and
the Alpha activity is prevailing when a person is snoozing
or closing his eyes. All along the transition from awake to
sleep or drowsy state; drowsiness instructions can be sent
by a wide-range of multimodal data signals. For
drowsiness detection for Human Computer Interaction
(HCI), the signals may be divided into four types.

B. Brain computer interface (Bel)
It is a system that lets people get across with
the
external world only by thinking without depends on
muscular or nervous activity [6]. BCI starting by
controlling the user's brain activity which is transmitted
into brain signals braced to obtain characteristics
collected into a vector termed the "feature vector". The
aligning of the concluding results into commands to
be used by the system that shows a feedback to the
user in order to calibrate or adjust their brain activity.
In order to calculate brain expressions, diverse realizing
technologies have been imported such as the Functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FMRI),
Positron
Emission Tomography
(PET),
and
Functional
Near-Infrared Brain Monitoring (FNIBM). Because of
its high time resolution, noninvasiveness, ease of
acquisition, and cost effectiveness, the EEG is the
adequate brain controlling technique in current BCIs.

Related Work

Through this part, we are focusing on recent
approaches to calculate the drowsiness' s level, if car
technologies are going to secure or at least alert of driver
drowsiness, what expressions does the conductor give off
that can be mentioned? In literature, diverse categories of
technologies In literature, diverse categories of
technologies that offer driver drowsiness detection.
Those techniques can be partite into three main types:

Vehicle based measures: A diverse metrics which
contains detours from lane position, change of the
steering wheel, tension on the acceleration pedal,
etc., are regularly monitored. In spite of, any
variation in these standards adduces to the
possibility of a significant increment in the driver
drowsiness level.

Physiological based measures: Drowsiness level is
measured by detecting heart beat, brain information
and pulse rate.

In reality, drowsiness detection is depended on the
three parameters indicated overhead. In recent work,
these measures should be conducted to maintain
observation on the present approaches, issues correlated
with them and the improvements that must be mentioned
to produce a robust technique.
In this paper, the proposed system consists of EEG
analysis

PRESENT WORK

A. System Overview
In this part, we used an EEG headset in goal to
evaluate the drowsiness state. To collect the EEG Data, we
include used the Emotiv EPOC headset containing
14 electrodes (AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, 01, 02, P8, T8,
FC6, F4, F8 and AF4) and 2 references electrodes. These
electrodes are located in relation to the standard design
of the 10-20 system. This system guides to the
architecture of the electrodes changing from 10 or 20%
depending to the morphology of the individual (Fig.1.).

FFT and Pass-bandfiltering
For the extraction phase, some researches applied the
wavelet [9], and some others work with FFT. In our
work, we have considered an EEG signal of a period of
20 seconds that may be asset in the starting, in the
middle or at the closing of the experience. Basically,
we have adapted the FFT on the signal, and then a pass­
band filtering is used to obtain the expected frequency
bands.

We define 6 principles EEG pulses: delta, theta,
alpha, mu, beta and gamma. Every one of them is further
remarkable in various positions as represented in the
Table I: In proportion for our objectives, we propose to
use only the Alpha and Beta pulses that are the best
particular pulses in the drowsiness state inspection. To
follow the measures of these pulses in six positions in
the frontal lobe: AF3, AF4, F3, F4, FC6 et F8, and
a one situation in the parietal lobe: P8.

E. Fuzzy logic classification
For the classification of the different pulses, we adopt the
Mamdani fuzzy logic technique (Fig.3).
Arousal (A), valence (V), dominance (D) is three inputs and
the state of drowsiness (DS) present the output variable.

D. Feature extraction
Arousal (A): A large beta capacity and a low
alpha correspondence in the parietal lobe. Beta
pulse is relied on state of a warning or awakened
mind, although alpha wave is particular leading in
a case of resting. Thus, the beta/alpha ratio is a
moderate character of the activity case of a body
[lO].

Analysis Process

To validate of the chosen classifier, the Mamdani call the
"Fuzzy logic controller" contained in the Simulink library. In
this function, the Simulink bloc of the EEG pulses
evaluates contains a Matlab function (Function1). The task of
Function1 is to recall the file including the different pulses,
comply with the FFT on this pulse, use the passband filtering to
obtain the different pulses as well as we deduce the
characteristics of the signal by designing the three inputs ( A, V
and D) rates.

Fig.5 shows an example of raw EEG data Physionet
database. This example includes raw EEG activity
measured by electrodes across several frontal sites.
The data of all the channels from each participant was
transformed into frequency domain using FFT. The power
of all the channels was computed by squaring the
amplitude of the frequency domain signal. (Fig.6).

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS

In this paper, we aim to develop an automatic system
for drowsy driving identification or detection by
analyzing EEG signals of the driver. This proposed has
been validated in a standard database.
By evaluating the experimental results phase, we have
achieved to get a degree of recognition advantageous to
evaluate the drowsiness level; the degree of recognition is
encouraged and suggestible to be ameliorated
As future researches, we are aspiring to suggest an
advanced assistance system which monitors two types of
risk: the inside vehicle dangers by evaluating the driver
vigilance stage, and the outside vehicle dangers by
detecting all different road moving and static objects
during the vehicle works.
