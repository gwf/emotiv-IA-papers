Abstract. Modern highly technological teaching widely uses
neurotechnologies related to creating new educational products, expanding
the content of education and establishing objective feedback with students.
One of the most promising neurotechnologies in the sphere of education is
the method of biological feedback (BFB) based on studying the current
psychophysiological state of students and using this information for further
correction of the educational process, improving its quality and efficiency.
This article presents the results of the studies based on the method of
biological feedback to investigate the influence of the form of presentation
of the educational material on the current psychophysiological state of
students. During the BFB-studies, we used the PEN method developed by
Hans and Sybil Eysenck to form focus groups of students and the CMS
method to process the results of the studies. The research resulted in
quantitative values of parameters of the current psychophysiological state
of students reflecting the degree of intensity of such properties as the
general adaptive resource, the degree of mobility (instability) of
psychological processes, neuroticity, psychic productivity etc. (a total of 19
parameters).The study’s results based on the biological feedback method
showed that studying educational materials that are different in form
influences the parameters of the current psychophysiological state of
students. The indicators of reserve of control of psychological activity,
regulating and adapting the psychological sphere, as well as the indicators
of reserve of syndromologicaladaptiveness of the current state if students
study the textual material on their own, will improve as compared to
studying graphical material only. Different types of educational material
can cause anxiety and increased apprehension, with textual material
contributing the least to these effects.

1 Introduction
Development of highly technological teaching is related to such key cognitive technologies
of the future as neuro-interfaces, Neuronet and biological feedback (BFB). Using devices
based on neuro-technology will make it possible to create new educational products,
expand the content of education by transiting from the textual, graphical or audio content of
the educational process to include tactile, motoric, emotional and other content. Developing

and copying physiologic interfaces that can be used to improve the activities in the spheres
of corporative marketing, medicine, sports, gaming etc., the potential of the entire body
(body position and facial expression scanners – Kinect, LeapMotion, MYO etc.), sight
direction (Eye Tribe), controllers of the current health state (heartbeat frequency, blood
pressure), monitors of the level of physical activeness (Fitbit, Jawbone), electric
encephalographs for sending messages (Emotiv) will inevitably lead this set of tools to
become widely used in the sphere of education in the near future [1].
Neurotechnologies using biological feedback are more and more widely used in the
modern educational process [2]. The market of evaluation and training cognitive abilities
based on BFB methods, which was USD 1.7 billion in 2013, is expected to grow to USD
5.7 billion by 2018, according to predictions of experts [3].
The essence of the BFB method is visualization for the tested person using a screen, or
in the audio form, of the current values of his/her physiological parameters determined by
the clinical protocol, that are divided into two large groups:
- “neuronic feedback” (neurofeedback, neurotherapy) based on modifying different
parameters of the electroencephalogram (EEG) of the brain (amplitude, power, coherence
etc. of the basic rhythms of EEG;
-biological feedback (biofeedback) measuring the values of the vegetative (sympathicparasympathetic) activation (skin conductivity, cardiogram, pulse frequency,
electromyogram, temperature, photopletizmogram etc.).

2 Overview of literature
Currently, BFB methods are used in education in the following cases:
- achieving high functional ability of participants of the educational process (studying
adaptability of students to the educational process [4], measuring the actual
psychologicalstate of high school pupils in the conditions of interactive studying [5],
relieving apprehension of students during the exams, relaxation and positive attitude,
speech correction) [6];
- optimizing physical or mental activity (general improving of health and harmonizing
the performance of the nervous and vascular systems);
- therapy of addictive behavior, treatment of hyper-active schoolchildren [7].
In the foreign literature there are articles describing the use of BFB methods in
education [8, 9, 10].
In some foreign educational organizations, teachers and students are offered courses of
BFB for health improving and harmonizing the nervous and vascular systems. For example,
in Japanese universities, BFB methods are used during exam periods to relieve students’
apprehension. In schools of the state of South Dakota (USA), these methods are used within
the framework of the program “Self-Awareness through Training with BFB Methods” [7].
The Charity fund Melinda & Bill Gates Foundation (specializing in improving the
educational system) issued a grant in 2011 for Clemson University (South Carolina, USA)
to carry out pilot studies of students’ involvement into the educational process by changing
the galvanic resistance of skin [11].
Russian specialists, like their foreign colleagues, actively investigate projects based on
BFB methods. For example, a monitoring research on students’ adaptedness for studying at
Saint-Petersburg polytechnic university Named after Peter the Great showed that the
process of students’ adaptation for studying at a technical higher school can be deteriorated
not only due to their particular features in the emotional and communicative spheres but
also due to various deficiencies in the development of their intellectual capabilities, the
most important of which is the logical, abstract and 3D engineering thinking [4].

Within the framework of another project, the actual psychological state of senior high
school students was studied in the conditions of interactive teaching. Differences were
detected in well-being, activeness and mood in class with interactive methods of
introducing new educational material [5].
With the use of BFB-based diagnostics of physiological changes for students in the
conditions of educational stress, methods of stress states correction are being developed in
relation to teaching [12].
Focused instrumental measurement of the psychophysiological state of students will
help find out which time of day and which conditions are the most favorable for studying
and tune individual regimes of the educational process, as well as efficiently control the
well-being of students and teachers [1].
Therefore, BFB methods can be used as a means to promote an individual method of
improving the well-being, as a tool that can help to bring up healthy generations, as a set of
methods and forms of education without negative impact on the state of health, as an
efficient method to evaluate pedagogical technologies [13].

3 Method of studies
Within the framework of the research carried out by the “Advertising and PR” department
of the Institute of Humanities of Saint-Petersburg polytechnic university named after Peter
the Great in the spring of 2017, a study was conducted to evaluate the emotional state of the
2 grade students of the course “Advertising and PR” in the practical seminars on the
“Basics of Advertising”. The purpose of the study was investigating the inter-relation
between the forms of presenting the educational material and the current psychological
state of the students using the measured results with the method of biological feedback. The
tasks of the study were as follows:
- preliminary evaluation of the psychophysiological state of students on the basis of
BFB method before the educational presentation.
- final evaluation of the psychophysiological state of students on the basis of BFB
method after the educational presentation.
- comparing the obtained data for the experimental and the reference groups and
forming the conclusions.
A hypothesis for the study was the assumption that presenting the educational material
in the graphical form improves comprehension and memorizing, has a positive effect on the
psychological state of students as compared with the textual form of presentation.
For the experiment, two focus groups of students were formed, equal in the number (12
people each), similar in the age and sex. Besides, the participants had similar distribution in
psychological parameters estimated with the help of a PEN questionnaire to measure such
psychological features as neuropsychological instability, extraversion and psychoticism.
Collecting the data on the emotional state of students was based on psychophysiological
methods of CMS (Current Mental State – of the current psychological state) implemented
in the form of a hardware-software complex (HSC) for CMS. This method makes it
possible to carry out an objective evaluation of the psychological state by the data from
cardiorhythmography, as well as monitor the changes in the state during various time
periods and evaluate the effect of various influences onto the psychological state. The
hardware-software complex includes a microcardioanalyzer and CMS software. The results
of the investigation were quantitative (in per cent) values for parameters of the current
psychological state of the examined persons (in 19 scales) reflecting the degree of the
feature of the current psychological state. In these scales (in per cent) the similarity or
difference is determined between the state of the examined person and the reference
samples.

4 Processing the studies’ results
Before class, both focus groups passed a preliminary evaluation of the psychophysiological
state with the biological feedback method on the basis of the HSC for CMS. Then each
group was given a lesson with studying theoretical material presented in various forms. The
experimental group was given a lesson in self-studying of the material on the “Basics in
advertising” in the direction “Brand mapping. Compiling Brand Comprehension Maps” in
the form of a presentation containing graphical illustrative material (animated schemes,
tables), video and sound. The reference focus group was given the same theoretical material
but presented in the textual form only. The students studied the theoretical material on their
own during 45 minutes, without interference from the tutor. After independently studying
the theoretical material, the experimental and the reference groups were given a theoretical
test to check their comprehension of the educational material on the topic “Brand mapping.
Compiling Brand Comprehension Maps”.
It was expected that the experimental group would have better results of the theoretical
test after self-study of the presentation. However, the average mark of the theoretical testing
of the experimental group was 2.91, with 4 “poor” marks, 5 “satisfactory” marks and 3
“good” marks, with no “excellent” marks. The reference group had the average mark 3.25,
with 4 “poor” marks, 3 “satisfactory” marks, 3 “good” marks and 2 “excellent” marks. In
our opinion, such results can be related to student poor ability to work with diagrams and
tables, as well as lack of comments and explanations from the tutor. It appears that, for
efficient studying of theoretical materials containing diagrams, tables and video, a
somewhat different approach is required than for studying textual materials.
After studying theoretical materials, each focus group was investigated again with the
psychophysiological method of CMS by the data from cardiorhythmography. Then the data
was entered into a computer and processed with the specialized software (Fig. 1).

Table 1 shows the main average marks for the experimental and reference groups by the
results of data processing comparable to reference values.

The overall compensation of the state of students groups. This value reflects the reserve
of control of the psychological activity, the optimal adaptive regulation (and adaptation) of
the mind. Before the experiment, the experimental group showed a larger limitation of the
reserve of nosological adaptability in the current state (scale Ad 1-1=15.2) than the reference
group (scale Ad2-1=21), with the reference norm Ad=73.3 (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2.Comparison of the values for the reserve of adaptability Ad for the experimental and reference
groups before studying the educational materials.

We can also note the current limitation of the reserve of syndromological adaptability in
the current state for the experimental group Z1-1=15.10 (this value for the reference group
was even higher, Z2-1=20.81) as compared to the reference norm (Z=88.4), Fig. 3.

After studying the educational materials, the values for the reserve of nosological
adaptability in the current state for the experimental group slightly increased (scale
Ad1-2=23.3); for the reference group, the value increased more abruptly (scale Ad 2-2=35.77)
(Fig. 4).

groups after studying the educational materials.

The current limitation of the reserve of syndromological adaptability for the
experimental group increased Z1-2=28.63 (for the reference group, this value increased even
more, Z2-2=35.84), Fig. 5.

State of health (psychological and physical). Before the experiment, the experimental
group had the average value in the scale of hypochondria equal to 2.01, and the reference
group had the value of 6.5.Before the experiment, both groups had not a very good state of
health and state of physical and psychological comfort (the reference value is 1), which can
be explained by the end of the academic year and general tiredness. However, upon
completion of the experiment, this value for the reference group slightly increased (scale IP,
the reference group had 5.1, the experimental group had 3.4). Studying new material
presented in the schematic form decreased the well-being of the experimental group.
Emotional sphere. This value reflects the character of the emotional reaction or
emotional component (mental balance, emotions intensity). Before the class study, for both
groups, the value of the emotional (and, therefore, the indirectly-volitional, mental etc.)
psychological deviation or stress (scale Af, the reference value of 4.8) was increased

(Af1-1=14.8, Af2-1=20.69). After the class study, both groups show an increased affectivity
value (scale Af, values 16.9 and 23.6, respectively).
In regard of the value DP (depression of the psychological state, opposite to vigor, the
feature of depression, the reference value is 1.4), it can be noted that, before the
experiment, the experimental group had 2.57, and the reference group had 2.13. After
studying the educational material, both groups had slightly decreased values for vigor in the
form of inclination for seriousness and apprehension with the generally high level of the
positive attitude (scale DP, values DP1-2=2.68 and DP2-2=3.13, respectively).
Before the class, both groups showed a clearly expressed degree of the current
excitement, vivacity and intensive emotions, increased movement activity, faster speech
and increased self-esteem (scale MN1-1 = 12.4, MN2-1 = 22.67) as compared to the reference
sample (MN= 1.1). As a result of different forms of the study material, both groups had this
value improved and decreased almost twofold (MN1-2 = 5.52 and MN2-2 = 14.45).
Before the experiment, both groups showed the current limitation of the assuredness,
exaggerated trend to be cautious, manifestations of anxiety and apprehension (TR 1-1=1.51
and TR2-1=3.45, the reference norm being 1.3). Upon completion of the experiment, the
experimental group had this value increased, whereas the reference group had it comparable
with the reference value (TR1-2=2.21 and TR2-2=1.3, respectively).
Before the experiment, the experimental and reference groups showed the current
emotional intemperance, disturbed balance “Myself-Others” (IS1-1=5.38 and IS2-1=6.62, the
reference norm being 1). After the experiment, both groups had this value improved almost
twofold (IS1-2=2.58 and IS2-2=3.34).
Before the beginning of the class studies, the value of the degree of limitation of the
current spontaneity and productivity of the mind when reflecting the reality for the
experimental and reference groups differed by several times (SL1-1=1.63 and SL2-1=4.31,
the reference norm being 1). After the experiment, this value decreased for both groups; for
the reference group is came close to the norm (SL1-2=0.37 and SL2-2=1.31).
Perceptive-thinking sphere. This value reflects the particular features of comprehension
and thinking. During the preliminary series of testing, both groups had this value close to
the reference value (N1-1= 7.16, N2-1= 8.3, the reference norm being 8.1). After the
experiment, this value, which characterizes the presence of risk of actual psychotraumatizing emotions, as well as a slight limitation of vulnerability and increased
sensitivity remained almost unchanged for the experimental group, whereas for the
reference group it was increased as compared to the reference sample (N1-2= 7.94, N2-2=
11.69).
A well-expressed degree of a decrease in specificity (pragmatism, reality) of thinking
before the experiment for the experimental group was lower than that of the reference
group; this value for both groups was higher than normal (S 1-1= 16.11, S2-1= 28.38, the
reference norm being 6.3). After classes, this value was improved for both groups; for the
reference group it was decreased more and came closer to the normal (S 1-2= 10.66,
S2-2=9.46).
Before the experiment, a higher degree of a decrease in self-criticism for own opinion
and actions was manifested in both groups (PD1-1=7.86, PD2-1=10.41, the reference norm
being 1.3). After classes, the value of assuredness of correctness (reality, accuracy,
faultlessness) of own opinion was decreased in both groups, with a more noticeable change
in the reference group (PD1-2=5.41, PD2-2=5.93).
Before the experiment, the degree of manifestation of repeated (obsessive, arising
unwillingly) emotions, decrease in the ability to willingly change over to other emotions
was higher in both groups (OF1-1=5.7, OF2-1=4.41, the reference norm being 1.1); after the
experiment, it was decreased for the experimental group, and it slightly increased for the
reference group (OF1-2= 3.74, OF2-2= 4.84).

Before the experiment, both groups showed some degree of limitation of the current
spontaneity, differentiation and productivity of mind when reflecting the reality
(SL1-1=1.63, SL2-1=4.31, the reference norm being 1); after the experiment, this value was
closer to normal for the reference group (SL1-2=0.37, SL2-2=1.35).
The sphere of will.This value mainly reflects an intention, direction, strength and
intensity of psychological reaction. Before the experiment, both groups showed a small
degree of slowing down in the psychological reactions; however, the experimental group
slowed down more (E1-1=13.55, E2-1=21.53, the reference norm being 7.6). After the
experiment, the experimental group had this value close to normal, and the reference group
had it somewhat lower (E1-2=7.72, E2-1=19.15).
The value of rigidity of mind before the experiment and after it changed insignificantly
in both groups; for the experimental group, it came close to the reference norm (IZ 1-1=0.89,
IZ2-1=2.8, the reference norm being 1.2; IZ1-2=1.45, IZ2-2=2.72).
Before the experiment, both groups showed a somewhat limited psychological tonus;
there could be a feeling of general weakness and fatigue (AS1-1=2.86, AS2-1=3.66, the
reference norm being 1.2); after classes, this value was significantly increased in the
reference group AS1-2=3.19, AS2-2=5.31). After the experiment, the indicator of restraint of
emotions and the mental balance “Myself-Others” for both groups was improved almost
twofold; for the experimental group, it was closer to the reference norm (IS 1-1=5.38,
IS2-1=6.62, IS1-1=2.58, IS2-1=3.34, the reference norm being 1).

5 Conclusions and recommendations
As a result of the previous pilot study, it was estimated that using active methods of
teaching, unlike the traditional ones, is more efficient in respect of influence on the state of
health, adaptability and productivity of mind for students [14].
A series of further experiments with the use of preliminary measurements showed that
studying various forms of educational materials causes improvement or deterioration in
different groups of values of the current psychological state of students. For example, the
value of reserve of control of psychological activity, regulation and adaptation of mind, as
well as the value of reserve of syndromological adaptability in the current state of students
when self-studying textual material is improved more than that when studying only
graphical materials.
The indicators of psychological and physical state of health of students also depend on
the form of presentation of the material. For example, the indicators of the emotional sphere
of students change during studying various forms of educational materials; there can be an
increase in the intensity of emotion, as well as a decrease in vigor in the form of some
tendency towards seriousness and apprehension with generally high level of the positive
attitude; however, the indicators of mania are decreased and the balance “Myself-Others” is
improved. Various forms of educational materials can cause anxiety and increased
apprehension, with the textual material contributing the least to this effect.
It is noteworthy that the indicators of a degree of limitation in the current spontaneity
and productivity of mind of students when reflecting the reality are improved when
studying textual material, whereas the indicators characterizing the risk of presence of
actual psycho-traumatizing emotions, as well as a slight limitation of vulnerability and
higher sensitivity are deteriorated.
As the experiment result showed, studying textual presentations deteriorates the values
of specificity (pragmatism and reality) of thinking, as well as the reality, accuracy and
faultless of the opinion.
When studying the illustrated presentations, the indicators of the degree in
expressiveness of repeated (obsessive, arising unwillingly) emotions and the decrease in the

8

SHS Web of Conferences 44, 00002 (2018)

ability to willingly change over to other emotions are improved, whereas the indicators of
productivity of mind when reflecting the reality are improved when reading texts.
Basing on our experiment, we can draw the conclusion that working with new
educational materials always increases the stress, disregarding of the presentation form of
that material. Obviously, in order to achieve the optimal results of the educational process,
it is necessary to alternate the presentation forms of the educational material between the
textual and the graphical forms; interactive presentations cannot be considered an
alternative to studying educational texts.
Despite the fact that educational neurobiology has quite a long history, there is still a lot
to be done to implement the results of neuro-studies into the educational process. In order
to improve the functioning of the educational system on the basis of the data of neuroscience and better understand their importance for teaching, an open dialogue is required
between professionals in these two spheres.One of the directions for cooperation in the
inter-disciplinary context “biology– neuro-science – cognitive neuro-science – psychology–
educational studies –organization of educational process” [15].
As BFB technologiesare developed, the focused instrumental monitoring of the state of
body and mind and subsequent adaptation to them makes it possible to find out, for
example, which time of day and which conditions are the most efficient for teaching a
particular person, and tune in the individual regimes of studies, teach the person to selfcontrolling own states (relaxing, concentration etc.) [1].
Further investigations using the methods of biological feedback can help answer the
important questions about comprehension of the educational material; about students’
motivation, their emotional state and involvement of capabilities to memorize the material;
about the optimal time-schedule of classes, alternating between “active” and “passive”
hours (for example, between physical training and lectures); about the time required for
restoration (relaxation) after difficult classes and exams. Plans for further experiments
presume investigations of the role of the teacher in influencing the psychophysiological
state of students.
In general, the results of the experiments make it possible to draw the conclusion that
using the biological feedback method is efficient from the viewpoint of obtaining the actual
data on the current psychological state of students to better tune the parameters of the
educational process; on the other side, due to the fact that, during classes, the students run
the risk of developing psychological deviations, therefore, to maintain the psychological
health and improving the stress-resistance, the method of biological feedback can be used,
as well as methods of relieving psycho-emotional stress and BFB training sessions.
