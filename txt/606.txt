Abstract
Stress in music performance shows an intrinsic relationship with changes in cardiovascular functioning and emotions, yet to date, studies analysing these stress indicators are few
and far between. The overarching aim of this thesis is therefore to investigate performance
stress through the lens of both self-reported anxiety and physical stress signatures in heart
rate variability. For rigour, this is achieved through a close examination of the relationship
between stress and structural complexity of heart rate variability in response to different
conditions musicians underwent: (1) a low- and high-stress performance and (2) a simulated performance environment. In my thesis I approached the problem in a comprehensive
way and investigated five Studies. Studies 1 and 2 (Chapters 3 and 4) employ new heart rate
variability methods to analyse physical stress. Study 3 (Chapter 5) compares heart rate variability responses before and during a performance in a simulated and a real-life performance
environment; Study 4 (Chapter 6) qualitatively addresses further enhancements related to
simulated performance environments. Study 5 (Chapter 7) examines heart rate variability
responses to simulated performance feedback of different emotional valence. Results provide conclusive evidence that musicians performing in high-stress conditions display lower
levels of structural complexity in the heart rate variability (signature of high stress), in particular prior to the performance, and a statistically significant elevation of subjective anxiety.
The findings show that both simulated and real performance scenarios create similar physical and emotional responses. Interviews with musicians reveal the benefits of simulations
in combination with complementary training methods. More immediate follow-up research
may focus on heart rate variability responses to other training strategies, such as Alexander
Technique and physical exercise; use a greater selection of standardised self-assessments;
and evaluate musicians experiencing severe performance stress, for which this thesis has
paved the way.

1 | Introduction

The experience of performance stress depends upon many individual factors. For some, the
amount of time spent on practice or the difficulty of the piece can be controlled, whereas
for others, factors including the type of situation are subject to great variability, effectively
making each performance a unique experience. The perception of these experiences can be
experienced positively (i.e., eustress) or negatively (i.e., distress), with mental, physical and
behavioural symptoms sometimes occurring hours, days or weeks before an actual performance. These symptoms can include a pounding chest, excessive sweating, or problems
focussing attention on a given task. If these problems are reinforced through a lack of sufficient coping strategies or due to a particularly vulnerable predisposition (e.g., a high level of
trait anxiety), a musician is likely to experience debilitating performance stress, potentially
leading to a phenomenon labelled as music performance anxiety.
Over the past four decades, research has particularly focused on the psychological responses
to performance stress, such as music performance anxiety, and has largely ignored the physiological component, including changes in a musician’s cardiovascular activity. Unlike music performance anxiety, which is usually described as the feeling of worry and uncertainty
prior to a particular performance (and which may involve the experience of physiological
symptoms and the deployment of various behavioural strategies), performance stress is primarily focused on the body’s reaction in its environment to the demands placed on it in
order to meet the challenges of a particular kind of performance. To clarify the differences
and similarities between stress, performance stress and music performance anxiety, the following sections provide an overview of each phenomenon and its causes. Then, I discuss the

development of my own professional background and how I became interested in studying
performance stress.

The concept of stress

Classically, theories of stress have been divided into two main categories (Derogatis & Helen, 1993): response-oriented theories and interactional or transactional theories.
The response-oriented theories define the response to the environment as the main causal factor
involved in the experience of stress. As such, it is the pattern and amplitude of the physical
and mental response that has been used to classify the intensity and degree of stress perception. This has, for instance, been observed in the degree to which the response manifests
itself in the physiological system, such as through the release of the stress hormone cortisol
and the likelihood of an increase in skin reactions, muscle tension and pain sensitivity (see
Table 1.1).
The first major contributions to understanding stress and its physiological manifestations
from a response-oriented perspective arose from Cannon (1929) and Selye (1950), who both
closely examined the relationship between a stressor and a stress response in relation to the
sympathetic nervous system (SNS) as well as the adrenal glands’ activity.
To clarify, the SNS is part of the complex neuronal network whose basis is the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS consists of the brain and the spinal cord, and has three main
functions: the input of sensory information, the integration of information and the motor
output. These functions are carried out by the transmission of impulses and information
by means of afferent and efferent nerve cells and synapses that are connected throughout
the body. In other words, once information (e.g., sensory input) from the internal/external
environment has reached and been processed by the brain, impulses are sent back through
the spinal cord to the muscles and glands, generating a specific output. The CNS is further
supported by the peripheral nervous system (PNS), a vast network of mainly sensory receptors which functions as an additional source of information. The PNS itself is divided into

3
the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system (ANS). While the somatic
nervous system provides information to and from the joints, skeletal muscles, bones and
skin, the ANS involuntarily controls the internal organs, such as the cardiovascular, respiratory or endocrinological system. The ANS is divided into two subsystems, the sympathetic
(SNS) and the parasympathetic system (PNS), with the first activating the metabolic output
and the latter slowing it down (Sarafino, 1996).
Both the SNS and PNS have a distinctive structure; the SNS contains fibres that are mainly located at the large ganglia located near the spinal cord, with both the preganglionic SNS neurons and postganglionic neurons traveling to the targeted organs (e.g., the heart), leading to
cross-communication and co-activation facilitated by the neurotransmitter norepinephrine.
In contrast, in the PNS, the ‘. . . preganglionic fibres exit from the brain-stem and sacral segments of the spinal cord and synapse with postganglionic fibers close to the target organs
without passing through common ganglia’ (Levenson, 2014, p. 101). Due to the fact that
neurotransmission throughout the PNS occurs through the release of acetylcholine, the circulating norepinephrine does not lead to distorted activation of the PNS (Levenson, 2014).
In an attempt at defining and understanding stress, Cannon identified four main components of a stress response, which he considered to fall under the umbrella of the fight-or-flight
response (and the activation of the SNS): (1) The body requires a stable and regulated state to
function flexibly, which means that (2) an interruption of this stability by a specific stressor
automatically involves changes in our physiological mechanisms (in order to regain control). (3) These physiological mechanisms are diverse and work simultaneously as well as
separately, and (4) are a result of organised autonomy. As such, the fight-or-flight response enables us to focus so we can quickly respond to the situation through an increased metabolic
output (Sarafino, 1996).
In contrast, the adrenal glands’ activity is part of the endocrinological system and is responsible for distributing hormones such as cortisol or adrenalin into the blood stream. Based on
the activation of the CNS and the hippocampus, corticotrophin-releasing hormones (CRH)
and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are sent out from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary

4

Chapter 1. Introduction

gland, secreting adrenocorticotropic hormones (ACTH). Reaching the zona fasciculata of the
adrenal glands, the ACTH activates the outer adrenal cortex and the inner medulla, with the
former producing glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, and the latter generating catecholamines,
including epinephrine or norepinephrine. Both are in charge of diffusing oxygen, glucose
and lipids (i.e., energy carriers) to the muscles and the brain in order to reduce the sensation
of pain, increase anti-inflammatory activity and ensure adequate immune functioning.
Selye was particularly interested in the interplay between stress and endocrinological responses, and based on his work, he created a model for understanding stress which is called
the General Adaptation Syndrome. In this model, he considers stress responses to be comprised of three main stages: (1) an alarm reaction (comparable to Cannon’s fight-or-flight
response), (2) a stage of resistance, involving increased physiological arousal to adapt towards the stressor, and (3) a stage of exhaustion, resulting from stress exposure over a long
period of time and thus weakening the physiological system. If not prevented (e.g., by sufficient coping strategies), a consistently high level of arousal leads to a phase of exhaustion,
fatigue and the increased likelihood of developing disorders such as depression and anxiety.
In contrast, interactional or transactional theories define stress through an emphasis on the organism as a mediator between the stimulus (and the stimulating characteristics of the environment) and the patterns of the stress responses that they trigger. Thus, interactional theories have been developed in consideration of the fact that response-oriented theories may be
too simplistic to fully grasp the impact of stress since they do not consider the importance of
the person, which has been found to form the basis of great variations within and between
the different responses to stress among individuals. Transactional theorists therefore not
only consider the person that is impacted by the relationship between the environment and
the stress response, but also the cognitive, perceptual and physiological characteristics of the
person himself/herself. In particular, these theories highlight the dynamic interplay of the
reciprocal interactions between the individual (including cognition, perception and physiology) on the one hand and the environment on the other, with feedback pathways conducting
constant updates amongst these components in order to achieve homeostasis. As a consequence, such theorists believe that the experience of stress is a product of the assessment of

5
the situation (the properties of the stimulus), the individual’s personal capability to handle
the distressing event and the particular physical and mental response patterns involved.
A well-known model that relies upon the assumption of the interactional or transactional theories is the transactional model developed by Lazarus (1993). The transactional
model highlights the importance of the cognitive appraisal of the stress stimuli (Lazarus
& Abramovitz, 2004; Lazarus, 1993). In doing so, cognitive appraisal is characterised by
three main features: (1) associative processing, which consists of a quick and automatic
recall of past experiences and memories; (2) processing which takes longer, yet is more flexible and encompasses conscious thinking; and (3) the monitoring of the overall incoming
appraisal information, involving the evaluation of the situation in terms of motivational relevance and congruence, the coping potential and whether stress is caused by the individual
himself/herself or whether it is imposed by another person. Based on these three appraisal
methods, it has been proposed that stress is neither a simple product of circumstances nor
exclusively dependent upon personal characteristics; rather, it has been characterised as a
‘. . . relationship between the person and the environment that is appraised by the person as
taxing or exceeding his or her resources and endangering his or her well-being’ (Lazarus &
Folkman, 1984, p. 19). Therefore, restoration of the physical and psychological resources
involved happens through the application of effective coping strategies.

Music performance anxiety versus performance stress

Chapter 1. Introduction

chology of Music Performance Anxiety (Kenny, 2009). Kenny illuminates music performance
anxiety in practically all of its guises, and critically examines its causes, symptoms and treatments, as well as their meaning and implications for practising musicians.
By first laying out psychological frameworks embedded in a short historical overview,
Kenny creates an understanding of the development of general and specific theories of music performance anxiety. She discusses nomothetic and idiographic approaches, Descartes’
and Freud’s theories of body and mind, Darwin’s and Canton’s assumption of survival, and
the importance of biology and the environment. She also explains how anxiety can become
problematic, or in the worst case, pathological. She then refers to the classifications, defining
features, commonalities and differences of anxiety disorders, using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) to discuss ‘. . . whether people suffer from
a unique condition known as performance anxiety or whether their performance anxiety is
a manifestation of another underlying anxiety disorder or other psychopathology’ (Kenny,
2011, p. 34).2 After setting out the groundwork, she defines music performance anxiety.
Kenny points out that, while many researchers have sought to provide new insights into
phenomena related to music performance anxiety, they have typically lacked a coherent and
consistent definition of the underlying concept, ‘. . . the first and essential step in its analysis
and eventual understanding’ (Kenny, 2011, p. 47). For a concise definition, we can turn to
one of Kenny’s earlier publications:

Music performance anxiety is the experience of marked and persistent anxious
apprehension related to music performance, which has arisen through specific
2007), each expression has to be noted with differences in its quality and according to their level of arousal.
Steptoe (2001) for instance distinguish stage fright and musical performance anxiety in terms of the evaluative
nature of the situation. To put this into context, performance anxiety does not only appear on stage rather than
in various of settings (e.g., one to one lesson or rehearsal). Further the experience of anxiety due to upcoming
performances may build up days before, whereas the term fright is associated with an unexpected appearance
of fear which does not necessarily imply impaired performance.
2 The threshold between commonly and benign experiences of anxiety and the sensation of anxiety that
causes clinical relevant interference with one’s life is defined in the International Statistical Classification of
Disease and Related Health Problems (ICD) or the more commonly known Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders (DSM: Bögels et al., 2010). Both are internationally used guidelines and cover a wide
range of medical and psychological health condition, defined through a 5-axes-system. This clinically relevant
system includes clinical disorders (Axis I), underlying personality disorders (Axis II), acute medical conditions
(Axis III), psychosocial and environmental factors (Axis IV), and global assessment of functioning for children
under the age of 18 (Axis V).

7
anxiety-conditioning experiences. It is manifested through combinations of affective, cognitive, somatic and behavioural symptoms and may occur in a range
of performance settings, but is usually more severe in settings involving high ego
investment and evaluative threats. It may be focal (i.e., focused only on music
performance) or occur comorbidity with other anxiety disorders, in particular social phobia. It affects musicians throughout their lifetime and is at least partially
independent of years of training, practice and level of musical accomplishment.
It may or may not impair the quality of the music performance (Kenny, 2009, p.
433).

Kenny has arrived at this definition by unravelling overlapping theoretical approaches.
The above is predicated upon Barlow’s emotion-based theory, a triple set of susceptibilities
which is responsible for developing anxiety/mood disorders, emphasising genetic contributions, and general and specific (early-) life experiences as sufficient conditions to produce
MPA (Barlow, 2000). To put this into context, the triple set of vulnerabilities emphasises
genetic contributions, as well as general/specific (early-) life experiences as the main indicators for developing anxiety (disorders). Genetic vulnerabilities can be seen as traits, such
as high levels of neuroticism or introversion, strongly determining and predicting specific
reactions across different conditions (Spielberger, Gorsuch, & Lushene, 1970). General life
experiences may be experienced by the lack of secure attachments in early childhood, while
specific vulnerabilities encompass negative somatic sensations during an evaluative process. All of them reinforce the feeling of uncontrollability and unpredictability in handling
these situations successfully, likely to develop a variety of clinically, temporally sustainable
anxiety disorders, including social anxiety, panic disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder
(Barlow, 2000).
These conceptualisations are used to describe the epidemiology and measurability of music
performance anxiety and function as a precursor for Kenny’s own model. She outlines the
advantages and disadvantages of test batteries, introducing her Music Performance Anxiety
Inventory. This particular questionnaire stems from Barlow’s theory, including among other

8

Chapter 1. Introduction

factors uncontrollability, self- and third-party evaluation, physiological arousal and memory
bias (Kenny & Osborne, 2006). It has been adapted across a wide range of age groups, offering a ‘. . . careful assessment of each musician’s anxiety profile [. . . ] so that targeted treatment
for each of the concerns can be addressed in therapy’ (Kenny, 2011, p. 107). Furthermore,
she refers readers to empirical work in which her questionnaire has been shown to achieve
sufficient reliability (Kenny, 2005). Kenny’s model of music performance anxiety focuses
on how it develops, as well as how anxiety-related problems persist and desist, comprehensively synthesising extant social context, behavioural, cognitive and emotion-based learning
processes.
After surveying theoretical perspectives that explain the causes of music performance
anxiety, Kenny turns her attention to common forms of therapy.

Here, she not only

lists cognitive/behavioural, psychoanalytic, emotion/performance-based and multimodal
approaches, but also scrutinises non-Western and other alternative methods including
mindfulness-based stress reduction, yoga, music therapy, biofeedback and the Alexander
Technique, as well the effect of self-administered substances such as alcohol, caffeine and
cannabis. In doing so, she concludes that, while a variety of possible treatments have become available over the past 30 years, ‘. . . empirical validation is [still] required before treatments can be recommended’ (Kenny, 2011, p. 231). Kenny also illustrates severe manifestations of MPA and draws together the theoretical and clinical perspectives reviewed earlier in
the book through a series of vivid personal accounts of musicians’ music performance anxiety experiences, punctuated by preventive and pedagogical advice. She gives the reader
a sense of what it is like to suffer from music performance anxiety, the implications it has
on one’s life, the personal histories that are predictive of certain outcomes and how different individuals are able to address their fears. This interweaving of scientific research and
personal narratives is what makes Kenny’s book so compelling, and it gives musicians who
suffer from music performance anxiety, as well as scientists, educators and interested others,
the possibility of shared insight.
Finally, she highlights lingering questions and problems that should be addressed in future
research. This includes the lack of studies into long-term treatment and the prevalence of

9
often short-term or symptom-focused therapies, which in her words show ‘. . . statistical differences before and after treatment, but . . . might not be clinically significant’ (Kenny, 2011,
p. 167). She points to the need for more replication of research findings, acknowledges that
there are individual responses to different therapies, but also exposes the problems of ecological validity and highlights the recent progress of psychodynamically-oriented therapies.
As a consequence, she not only focuses on adults and their performance anxiety-related
symptoms but takes care to emphasise that age-specific and exposure-related music performance anxiety, particularly in childhood, must be investigated further.

In summary, music performance anxiety is an expression not everyone is willing to speak
out loud if they suffer from having somatic, cognitive and behavioural vulnerability caused
through negative experiences in performances. However, it has an impact on a multiplicity
of musicians independent of their age, sex, experience or hours of practice. It is a psychological phenomena, which is characterised through symptoms such as increased heart rate,
sweating, dry mouth, negative thoughts and misattributions (Osborne & Kenny, 2008). It
creates stress responses (for more details, see section ‘Performance stress’), which makes a
performance—independent of the domain (e.g., sport, music or just public speaking)—very
challenging, if not impossible (Goode, 2004). Estimates are that 2% of the US population
are suffering from performance anxiety (Powell, 2004), where comorbidity (one third) is often the case. Furthermore, 10-15% of those affected with additional anxiety disorders, have
also experienced episodes of moderate to severe depression (Kessler, DuPont, Berglund,
& Wittchen, 1999). Great musicians as Vladimir Horowitz and Sergei Rachmaninoff had
suffered from debilitating performance anxiety, affecting their perceived quality of performances their whole lives through. Reasons for experiencing performance anxiety may be the
pressure of becoming a great artist, the financial challenges (most performers are not in the
enviable position to have contracts lasting more then one month or even worse to get paid
per hour) and the ambitious expectations of the audience to deliver a great performance.
All those aspects can lead to negative thoughts, provide behavioural inhibitions and causes
physiological disturbances (Lehrer, 1987). In sum, performance anxiety is a phenomenon,
which affects a wide range of different musicians (from solo to orchestral musicians), with

10

Chapter 1. Introduction

some of them even likely to quit their career due to performance anxiety (Wesner, Noyes, &
Davis, 1990).

Performance stress In the last two decades, studies have put increased interest in studying music performance anxiety and its causes, yet little has been done in the field of music
psychology (or performance science) with regards to the experience of performance stress.
Unlike music performance anxiety, which is usually described as the feeling of worry and
uncertainty prior to a particular performance (and which may involve the experience of
physiological symptoms and recruitment of various behavioural strategies), performance
stress is primarily focused on the body’s reaction (and the environment) to the demands
placed on it in order to meet any challenge to balance produced by any kind of performance.
In particular, performance stress is determined by a specific stressor, its interpretation and
processing, and followed by a stress response through the activation of specific areas in the
central nervous system. The stressor (in this case performing) is an aversive physiological and/or psychological event that is caused by internal or external demands that exceeds
one’s resources to cope with these demands successfully. The stressor of performing is interpreted and processed either automatically, or it may incorporate higher cognitive processes,
containing a detailed evaluation in terms of motivational relevance and congruence, future
expectancy and whether the situation is self- or other-imposed (Compas et al., 2014; Scherer,
2009). While it is important to acknowledge that the experience of music performance anxiety is an aspect of the experience of performance stress, this thesis aims to break new ground
by describing and evaluating a specific response to performance stress that has not received
much attention in performance science, namely the changes in heart rate variability (alongside the sensation of anxiety) to performance stress. The next sections therefore provide a
detailed explanation of heart rate variability and anxiety, before discussing the impact of
both through the lens of ‘emotion-specific autonomic responses’. At the end of this section, I provide an overview about my personal background and explanation of my personal
interest in studying performance stress.

Chapter 1. Introduction

Heart rate variability An example of a physiological altered state due to stress is represented in the cardiovascular system. The cardiovascular system is built upon two essential components; a pump (e.g., heart) and a circulatory system (e.g., blood vessels), both of
which are responsible for transport and passing specific nutrients to and from cells. In order
to sustain adequate cardiovascular functioning, the heart has to transport blood with a certain stroke volume (i.e., amount of blood) and pressure gradient (i.e., blood pressure) upon
the walls of blood vessels (Nichols, O’Rourke, & Vlachopoulos, 2011). As such, the human
heart has two main targets; exchanging oxygenated/de-oxygenated blood (i.e., pulmonary
circulation) and carrying the blood to all the organs and tissues (i.e., systemic circulation)
by contracting and relaxing the chambers. This is done by the heart’s two chambers at each
side—with the upper chambers known as left and right atrium and the lower ones left and
right ventricle, with four types of valves regulating the blood flow (Nichols et al., 2011):

• Tricuspid valve: Regulation of blood flow between right atrium and right ventricle;
• Pulmonary valve: Regulation of blood flow from right ventricle into pulmonary arteries (in order to collect oxygen from the lungs);
• Mitral valve: Regulates oxygenated blood flow (from lungs) from left atrium to left
ventricle;
• Aortic valve: Controls flow of oxygenated blood from left ventricle into the aorta (in
order to transport oxygenated blood and other nutrients into the rest of the body).

The regulation of the blood flow can be observed in the heart rate variability (Talbott, 2007).
The heart rate variability is the fluctuation or beat-to-beat intervals of the heart rate and is
triggered by the distribution of electrical impulses through the muscle cells of the heart (i.e.,
myocardium). Starting at the sino-atrial (SA) node, located at the top of the right atrium
near the superior vena cava, the electrical impulses generate contractions of the atrium before reaching the atrioventricular node (AV). The AV is located at the bottom of the right
atrium and transmits impulses through the His-Purkinje system of fibres, resulting in the
contraction of the ventricles (Urbanowicz, Zebrowski, Baranowski, & Hollyst, 2007). Both

13
the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) affect changes in the heart rate, which is observable within five beats (Sarafino, 1996 [response
rate SNS: 15 s; PNS: 5 s]; Urbanowicz et al., 2007).
The heart rate variability is furthermore impacted by the respiratory system (Clifford, 2002).
The main goal of the respiratory system can be described as an exchange of oxygen and
carbon dioxide (i.e., O2 and CO2 ) between the organism and its environment. This is done
by diffusing oxygen through the alveolar-capillary membrane into the lungs and transporting it through the organism’s tissues for exchange (i.e., blood-air [or -gas] barrier). The
mechanism of respiration can be characterised by four distinct patterns (Marieb, 2010): The
pulmonary ventilation (i.e., breathing), which is the movement of air into and out of the lungs,
the external respiration (i.e., gas exchange), the gas transport via the bloodstream, and the internal respiration, the exchange between blood and tissues, all of which are defined as the
movement of inspiration and expiration. In other words, the respiration contains the act of inspiration (TI ), expiration (TE ), the pause between both, the volume during one breath (VT ),
the total cycle duration (TTOT ) and the average respiration rate per minute.
While the TI causes shortened heart rate variability, the TE lengthens these intervals
(Berntson & Cacioppo, 2004). Under relaxed conditions (i.e., baseline conditions), heart rate
ranges between 60 and 80 beats per minute (bpm), yet can be substantially altered due to
stress (>100 bpm), alongside a decreased TE flow and an increased TI flow (i.e., hyperventilation) and respiration rate (Clifford, 2002; Wientjes, 1992). This was for instance shown
by Masaoka and Homma (2001), who addressed specific breathing patterns during anticipatory anxiety using electrical stimuli of 50 volts delivered to the forefinger. Anxiety was
monitored by the standardized State and Trait Anxiety Inventory and a Visual Analogue
Scales, anxiety sub scale (VAS: Aitken, 1969; Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, & Jacobs,
1983). Participants were asked to wear a mask measuring the expired ventilation, the tidal
volume, the respiratory frequency, the inspiration time and the expiration time. Compared
to a 15 min baseline period, the anticipatory period led to a significantly increased sensation
of state anxiety and an expired ventilation, while the times of inspiration and expiration was
decreased. No other alterations were observed. However, when the sample was grouped

14

Chapter 1. Introduction

into low- versus high-anxious participants, significant differences between groups were observed for the tidal volume, the breathing frequency, the expiration time, as well as the
PETCO2 . Trait anxiety and breathing frequency were significantly positively correlated.
Overall, the respiratory patterns under stress are characterised through increased, relatively
fast, shallow breathing, with a high mean of flow rate. As demands increase breathing
patterns becomes less shallow and although the mean inspiratory flow rate is further augmented, there is no change in the rate of breathing (Wientjes, 1992).

The emotional experience of performance stress Stress may also cause maladaptive emotional experiences (Allen & Leary, 2010). Emotions have been broadly defined in terms of
a ‘. . . distillation of an individual’s perception of personally relevant environmental interactions, including not only challenges and threats but also the ability to respond to them’
(Thayer & Lane, 2009, p. 85) and have to be considered as distinct from the concepts of
mood and arousal. Emotions are affective conscious states and are structured in relation to a
clear object. Moods are less intense than emotions, not directed towards a specific object and
usually experienced for up to several hours (i.e., emotions are believed to be object-specific
and shorter of duration). Arousal mainly reflects the activation of the ANS and may or may
not involve an emotional component.
Although there is some debate about the exact definition of emotions, most researchers agree
that emotions have four broad characteristics (Izard, 2007): (1) emotions trigger expressive
behaviour derived from primitive evolutionary neurological substrates, expressed through
common cross-cultural properties such as facial patterns; (2) the expression of emotions is
dependent upon the perception of the stimuli, and does not necessarily incorporate any
high-level appraisal or cognitive functioning; (3) basic emotions appear alongside an exclusive component of sensations (i.e., feelings), providing information for individual and
social functioning; (4) emotions incorporate exclusive regulatory components that impact
cognition and behaviour, and which function independently from homeostasis or natural
physiological drives, such as thirst or hunger. Thus, emotions enable individuals to com-

15
municate a specific message (e.g., social support) through alterations in facial expressions,
voice and body signals. While positive emotions such as joy or contentment facilitate attachment behaviour and the desire to discover, learn and attain new skills, negative emotions
including anger, fear and sadness generate rapid and autonomic responses to distressing
circumstances.
The valence and arousal of emotions in response to stress depend on how a stressor has been
appraised. Cognitive appraisal involves the evaluation of individual goals, relevance, motives or needs. The main target of an emotion is to mobilise the biological and neurological
processes that allow individuals to shift their performance and activity in a specific direction. These processes, which are partially governed by emotions, include goals, motivational
priorities (desires, drives, needs, urges, intentions), information-gathering motivation, imposed conceptual frameworks, perceptual mechanisms, memory, attention, communication
via emotional expression, behaviour, reflexes and learning (Mulligan & Scherer, 2012). For
instance, prioritising goals, or putting goals in a hierarchical order, is an emotion-dependent
activity and involves specialised processes that trigger certain behaviours. To put this into
context, emotions should elicit or induce construals that allow for an appropriate decision to
be made regarding a specific situation. This may include the retrieval of specific memories
and perceptual processes as well as attention (Tooby & Cosmides, 2008). As such, emotions
do not have clear boundaries and impact various physiological, mental and behavioural
states. They contain a combination of processes that exhibit a great deal of variability. Consequently, as the experience of emotions emerges, it is created from underlying affective
proportions. Indeed, most emotion-theorists see emotions as a product of the situational
structure, or as described by Mulligan and Scherer (2012, p. 346): ‘. . . [an] emotion is never
punctual and only some emotions endure without variation over time. Emotions typically
unfold dynamically. Emotions have a beginning and an end, although their exact duration
is difficult to specify. In consequence, emotion should be considered as an episode in the life
of an individual.’
As for performance stress, research has shown that if the situation is motivationally relevant and incongruent, and no sufficient coping strategies are possessed, then a maladaptive

16

Chapter 1. Introduction

emotional experience, such as performance anxiety, may accompany the stressor (Allen &
Leary, 2010). The emotion of anxiety is defined by exaggerated rumination and worry. Rumination is symptom-focussed and has the negative side effect of causing failures in adaptive problem solving (Kenny, 2011). As such, individuals who ruminate are consistently
reflecting on their problems without taking appropriate action (Nolen-Hoeksema, Wisco, &
Lyubomirsky, 2008). Furthermore, anxiety strongly correlates with maladaptive functions
such as self-criticism, negative self-concept3 and attitudes, perfectionism, neuroticism, low
task mastery and depression. For instance, musicians who experience an increased level of
anxiety also tend to strive for flawlessness and focus on overly critical evaluations (Stoeber
& Rambow, 2007). Both the striving for high performance standards and the concern about
the outcome of the performance are correlated, which may lead to an unhealthy state of
worry and rumination, as expressed by an exaggerated level of anxiety about an upcoming
performance.
Generally, the feeling of anxiety that persists along with a higher tendency towards perfectionism has been interpreted as a multidimensional construct including three types of
features: self-oriented, other-oriented and socially prescribed. For instance, studies such as
the one conducted by Mor, Day, Flett, and Hewitt (1995) have revealed that musicians with
a high degree of performance anxiety also present elevated levels of self-oriented perfectionism and socially prescribed perfectionism. Moreover, the presence or absence of a sense
of personal control has been shown to be a strong moderator between perfectionism and
anxiety, as well as perfectionism and goal satisfaction. Overall, individuals with a high level
of anxiety and rumination exhibit interfering instrumental behaviour, including a lack of
sufficient coping strategies to deal with the stress individuals experience before, during and
after a performance.4
3 Self-concept

is defined as the view of oneself, formed out of a combination of environmental experiences,
and reinforced or marked by some key factors such as frames of reference (Martens, Burton, Vealey, Bump, &
Smith, 1990)—the standards someone uses to judge their own traits and accomplishments (e.g., social comparison); causal attribution—factors to which someone attributes failure or success (Skaalvik, 1997); reflection from
important others (Rosenberg, Schooler, Schoenbach, & Rosenberg, 1995); master experience—the knowledge
in a specific domain that is not only shaped by self-efficacy (Bandura, 1978), but also by one’s self-concept
(Skaalvik, 1997); and psychological centrality—the factor according to which self-esteem is seen as an important part of having an adequate self-concept (Rosenberg et al., 1995).
4 Worry shares some of the same features with rumination; however, the experience of worry is future-

17
ANS and emotions Both the variability of one’s heart rate and the emotions that are experienced under stress lead to an emotion-specific autonomic response (Cacioppo, Uchino, &
Berntson, 1994; Kreibig, 2010; Quigley & Barrett, 2014; Stemmler, 2004). Such responses
may be coherent, which means that the organisation and coordination of the emotions has
an impact on different activities of the ANS and between the ANS and other response systems, such as facial expressions. They may also be specific, which means that each emotion
triggers different patterns in the ANS (Levenson, 2014). Both characterisations are plausible, considering that the ANS has more than one role, performing as a regulator, activator,
coordinator and communicator. For instance, the ANS acts as a regulator by maintaining
homeostasis, which is represented by the maintenance of a body state in order to minimise
internal damage and to maximise operational functioning (Levenson, 2014). If the ANS is
understood as an activator, then it needs to be taken into consideration that the activity of
the ANS is a result of short-term deviations that are not necessarily related to the function
of homeostasis. Such side-activities of the ANS enable the body to cope with challenges and
allocate resources where necessary without having an impact on the overall homeostasis.
In contrast, the ANS as a coordinator helps to gather information in a not only afferent but
also efferent fashion, and allows for the body to communicate any changes in the physical
state between and from old to new brain circuits. Finally, the ANS also serves as a communicator, producing visible changes in our appearance and delivering a ‘message’ that can be
perceived by our peers (e.g., facial expression: Levenson, 2014).
Considering all these different roles, functions and responsibilities of the ANS, the perception of stress may cause diffuse activation of the ANS, which involves a complex pattern of
physiological communication that is affected within and between individuals, and which
results in a high noise-to-signal ratio. Consequently, the objective assessment of distinctive
emotion-specific autonomic responses is rather challenging.
In summary, the ANS is designed to cope with internal and external challenges, which, duroriented and is not associated with thinking about past experiences (Kenny, 2011). Also, the ability to cope
with everyday hassles and to prevent the manifestation of physical symptoms is strongly connected with high
self-esteem and emotional support (DeLongis, Folkman, & Lazarus, 1988), which are directly connected to an
individual’s learning experiences.

18

Chapter 1. Introduction

ing the day, lead the body to experience a great variety of active ANS patterns, at one time
occurring in isolation (e.g., change in heart rate and breathing) and at the other in combination with various physiological responses (e.g., changes in endocrinological responses and
facial expression). In order to understand the interplay between the ANS and the emotional
experience, it is important to determine when the activation of an ANS pattern is due to a
specific emotional experience, or whether it is just a response caused by more banal homeostatic demands. For instance, changes in the pupillary diameter may be a result of different
light conditions, changes in the airway tonus, or changes in cardiac contractility. Based on
the huge variety of possible internal and external influences that can impact the ANS, it is
important to acknowledge that any ANS activity may not only occur due to a specific emotion that is experienced (since it is possible to experience two or three emotions at the time),
but also by daily demands and challenges that impact an individual’s autonomic functioning (Levenson, 2014).
Although still under debate, the majority of researchers have considered emotion-specific
autonomic response to consist of a top-down process, where the experience of emotions results in (distinctive) physiological response patterns. The impact that an emotion has on
ANS activity has to date been assessed by three major systematic meta-reviews, with the
main goal of differentiating between a variety of emotions and their underlying physiological dynamics.
Cacioppo, Berntson, Larsen, Poehlmann, and Ito (2000), for instance, reviewed 20 studies
that analysed measures such as heart rate and respiration metrics to understand the physiological changes that arose due to emotion-inducing stimuli, including emotions such as
happiness, disgust and fear. Their results showed that happiness caused greater heart rate
acceleration than disgust and fear, and anger caused greater acceleration than happiness,
but there was no difference between the corresponding rates for disgust and those among
a control group. In contrast, less agreement was observed for the respiration metrics, including inspiration volume and respiration amplitude. Both were increased, decreased or
unchanged during exposure to different emotional stimuli, suggesting different influences
of the peripheral vascular function. Overall, the authors found that negative emotions trig-

19
ger a greater response in the autonomous nervous activity compared to exposure to positive
emotional stimuli. However, these results were subject to great variability.5
Stemmler (2004) investigated the effects of two basic emotions, fear and anger, on physiological responses including heart rate and respiration. He selected 15 studies assessing a
minimum of two somato-visceral responses (e.g., heart rate and respiration) and calculated
the magnitude of their effects (point-biserial correlation) for three conditions: (1) fear versus
control; (2) anger versus control; and (3) fear versus anger. The results showed significant
effects on heart rate and moderate effects on respiration when comparing fear versus control and anger versus control. In contrast, in studies comparing the exposure to stimuli such
as fear versus anger, the results revealed more increased heart rates in fearful situations,
a pattern that was also observed for the respiration rates. Thus, although fear and anger
are theoretically assumed to share comparable features of valence and arousal, they exhibit
distinct physiological specificity.
Last, Kreibig (2010) examined the impact of emotions on heart rate variability, in particular the frequency distributions of electrocardiographic signals. To this end, he selected
134 studies that explored emotional exposure to happiness, anxiety or sadness, and their
impacts on physiological activity. Physiological measures mainly concentrated on cardiovascular and respiratory features, including frequency domain analysis (LF, HF, LF/HF),
respiratory depth, tidal volume, duty cycle and respiratory variability (for more details, see
Chapter 2). For the emotion of anxiety, the results showed an overall increase in the sympathetic nervous activity and a withdrawal of the vagal activity alongside faster and shallower
breathing. In particular, Kreibig (2010) found an increase in heart rate, a decrease in heart
rate variability and an increase in the LF power and the LF/HF ratio. With regards to respi5 Based

on the results, the authors developed a framework that aims to make sense of how emotional experiences might be shaped by (or shape) multiple (physiological) pathways. The model is referred to as the
somato-visceral afference model (SAME: Cacioppo et al., 2000), a continuum on which one end represents
emotional experiences as a result of distinct emotional somato-visceral patterns, and the other the perception
of an emotion that is attributed to undifferentiated physiological arousal. Based on the assumption of continuous interplay between emotions and physiological responses, the model postulates that the perceptual process
may produce a range of different emotions, as well as physiological responses that are related to more than one
emotional experience. Moreover, the model assumes that the ANS is not only able to change the experience
and the intensity of an emotion, but also that the sensation of emotions may be independent from the activity
of the ANS, and thus not capable of discriminating between the emotions that are experienced.

20

Chapter 1. Introduction

ration, the results revealed an increase in the respiration rate, including a decreased TI and
TE , and VT . Interestingly, happiness-inducing stimuli triggered the same patterns, such as a
decrease in vagal activity as well as increased respiratory activity; nevertheless, the findings
revealed greater variability in comparison to exposure to the emotion of anxiety. Kreibig
(2010, p. 411) emphasised a crucial observation within the psychophysiological stress research by stating:
For progress in the understanding of the functional organisation of ANS activity in emotion, future researchers will have to closely scrutinise and, if possible,
verify the specific type of emotion elicited as well as individual variations when
analysing autonomic parameters that need to be selected such that they allow
differentiation of the various activation components of the ANS. Only if the hypothesis of autonomic response organisation is properly tested, can valid inferences be drawn. It is hoped that this will pave the road [. . . ] for a generative
principle that can summarise and account for the varieties of emotion.
Fortunately, more recent models that enable us to ‘. . . closely scrutinise and, if possible, verify the specific type of emotion elicited’ are provided by the Component Process Model
(Scherer, 2009) and the Biopsychosocial Model (Blascovich, Mendes, Tomaka, Salomon, &
Seery, 2003; Rith-Najarian, McLaughlin, Sheridan, & Nock, 2014; Seery, 2011; Turner, Jones,
Sheffield, Barker, & Coffee, 2014), which consider the type of situation but also the way we
appraise the situation as main drivers for emotion-specific autonomic response.
The Component Process Model considers the occurrence of specific emotional experiences to
be the results of cognitive appraisals, which, in turn, lead to distinctive changes in the autonomic nervous system (e.g., heart rate variability).6 In Scherer’s model, appraisal involves:
6 It should be noted that the experience of an emotion may also happen independently from the type of stres-

sor (without cognitive appraisal), developed through (1) direct learning experiences and (2) indirect learning
experiences, (3) ‘biological preparedness’ or (4) non-associative means (Nebel-Schwalm & Davis, 2013). Direct
and indirect learning experiences encompass traditional learning approaches, such as classical conditioning
or observational learning, while the biological component reinforces these conditions (e.g., individuals, for instance, who have a high level of trait anxiety may develop a quicker and stronger response to fear-relevant [e.g.,
spiders, snakes] versus non-fear-relevant [e.g., flowers] stimuli). In contrast, the non-associative pathway represents an alternative by questioning how much of an association is truly required to develop anxiety related
symptoms, emphasising the unique impact of biological predispositions only.

21
(1) an old low-level neural circuit that functions automatically and which is genetically determined; (2) a schematic level, working fairly automatically by applying memory traces
from social learning processes; (3) an association level, incorporating cortical brain areas,
which may work unconsciously or be part of higher cognitive processes; and (4) a conceptual level, using propositional knowledge and effortful thinking. All four levels interact
with one another, generating a multimodal framework that continuously updates itself.
The final outcome is ultimately determined by: (1) relevance; (2) implications; (3) coping potential; and (4) the estimation of consequences for the self-concept and social norms/values.
In other words, any stressful event is assessed in terms of novelty, goal relevance and
whether or not the situation is pleasant. The individual also assesses the probability of
potential consequences, and the deviation from his/her own expectations. Moreover, the
situation is evaluated in terms of self- and third-person responsibility, and whether the individual has the control as well as the power to change the situation (Table 1.2).

Furthermore, Scherer believes that each evaluation of a situation happens sequentially,
where the individual undergoes a series of stimulus evaluation checks. In other words, the
type and intensity of the emotion experienced is a result of the appraisal process based on
a continuous execution of these checks. The first process of evaluation is the novelty check,
where the individual examines the situation in terms of its familiarity. This is followed by an
intrinsic pleasantness check, of which the outcome is based on learned associations and innate
feature detection. The next checks are labelled as the goal/need significance check the coping po-

22

Chapter 1. Introduction

tential check and the norm-self compatibility check. The goal/need significance check assesses
the extent to which the current situation is expected, urgent, or important to the satisfaction
of the individual’s personal goals. The coping potential check evaluates the degree of control over the situation, the potential to deal with the situation, the level of personal power
over the situation, and the assessment of the options available for internal adjustment. Finally, the norm-self compatibility check evaluates and compares the intended actions with
social and internal norms, the expectations of others and the standards of the self. Each
check leads to changes in various subsystems that serve the emotion, such as physiology,
expression, motivation, and feeling, thus, generating a pattern that defines the emotion. As
such, the experience of emotions is fluid and a product of constant re-evaluation (Clore &
Ortony, 2008), and depends on the characteristics of the situation, which then evolves into a
particular pattern of stress response.
To apply this to the context of performance stress, if a situation is novel and unpleasant (e.g.,
an audition), a defence response is initiated, expressed through an increased heart rate, decreased salivation, increased muscle tension and shrinking posture. If the implications of
this situation are harmless and do not cause negative consequences (e.g., a performance in
front of your peers to rehearse her/his repertoire for an upcoming performance), but also
less controllable and likely to change, a trophotropic shift occurs (Quigley & Barrett, 2014;
Scherer, 2009). This includes the activation of several physiological components, such as
the PNS, a variety of endocrinal glands, the anterior hypothalamus, portions of the limbic system and the frontal cortex. The opposite of trophotropic dominance is ergotropic
dominance, exhibited through the SNS, the posterior hypothalamus, portions of the limbic
system and the frontal cortex. Ergotropic dominance occurs when the situations are controllable, but the individual may not have the power to control them. This leads to fast
and irregular respiration, a rapid increase in heart rate and systolic blood pressure and a
decrease in diastolic blood pressure (Gellhorn, 1970).
Evidence to support the validity of the component process model has been found in a variety of studies that address the psychophysiological signatures of appraisal outcomes by
adjusting the degree of pleasantness experienced and the possibility of goal achievement

23
(Johnstone et al., 2007; Johnstone, van Reekum, Hird, Kirsner, & Scherer, 2005). Related studies such as the one conducted by Johnstone et al. (2005) evaluated the impact of emotional
changes in speech based on ANS activity by using a computer game to trigger emotional
speech. The computer game was either conducive to or obstructive of the goal of winning,
and was presented alongside a pleasant or unpleasant sound. A sample of 30 participants
took part in the study, and their speech was analysed in terms of mean energy, fundamentalfrequency level and utterance duration. The results revealed that the spectral density was
associated with the manipulation of pleasantness, and that dynamics in pitch were dependent upon the interplay between the experience of pleasantness and goal conduciveness.
However, the results also suggested that the changes in physiology were not only reflective
of one particular emotion, which gives weight to the complexity of understanding emotional
experiences through the lens of physiological responses.
In another study, Johnstone et al. (2007) monitored participants’ changes in physiological
markers such as skin conductance and changes in the frequency of their voices while performing a computer task with two levels of complexity, where participants either gained or
lost points based on the outcomes of their performances. The results showed that the vocal changes mostly depended upon the interaction between gain, loss and interactivity. In
particular, the rate at which the vocal cord was opened or closed was high with the experience of loss and increased difficulty (as opposed to the experience of loss and decreased
difficulty). The results of the skin conductance analysis revealed higher sympathetic arousal
in the loss situation than in the gain conditions, especially when the difficulty of the game
was high. As a result, the authors concluded that changes in the SNS activity can be related
to the emotional state based on the task’s difficulty and can be detected by specific physiological markers, such as skin conductance and different rates in vocal folds. Moreover, the
results implied that if the situation involves an increased risk of loss, the body mobilises its
resources in order to actively deal with the situation, which is indicated by the increased
SNS activity and the corresponding increased amplitude of skin conductance, as well as the
opening and closing rates of the vocal cords.
The Biopsychosocial Model for understanding challenges and threats (Blascovich & Mendes,

24

Chapter 1. Introduction

2000; Blascovich et al., 2003; Blascovich, Seery, Mugridge, Norris, & Weisbuch, 2004) considers the distinctive biological factors that determine the physiological and psychological
reactivity to stress, which are mainly determined by the perception of the situation as either a challenge or a threat (Seery, 2011). Similar to Scherer’s model, it involves the concept
of cognitive appraisal introduced by Lazarus and Folkman (1984), which mediates the effect between stress and stress response by evaluating a situation in terms of relevance and
congruence, task engagement and coping potentials. However, the biological factor adds
an additional component to the cognitive appraisal by allowing for the differentiation between positive and negative stress perception (challenge versus threat) and their distinctive
physiological markers. In particular, these markers are determined by specific changes in
the cardiovascular output (Seery, 2011; Turner et al., 2014).7 For instance, sympatho-adrenomedullary activity has been associated with both threats and challenges, while activation
of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis—responsible for releasing the stress hormone
cortisol—has been determined to be a response to threats only, tempering the sympathoadreno-medullary activity and therefore resulting in higher total peripheral resistance and
lower cardiac output (Seery, 2011). As such, the perception of a challenge has been connected with (1) an increase in cardiac output, and (2) a decrease in total peripheral resistance,
while the perception of a threat has been associated with (1) a small increase or decrease in
cardiac output, and (2) an increase in total peripheral resistance (Turner et al., 2014). Indeed,
studies that have compared the effects of both the perception of a challenge and a threat of a
particular situation have demonstrated that the perception of a challenge generates greater
cardiac output as well as a more positive performance outcome, as opposed to the perception of a threat (Blascovich et al., 2004; Seery, Weisbuch, Hetenyi, & Blascovich, 2010).
To put this into the present context, Seery, Weisbuch, and Blascovich (2009) assessed the impact of motivated performance situations and was able to define four cardiovascular indexes
that differentiate between task engagement and challenge versus threat. These were ‘. . . heart
rate; pre-ejection period, an index of the left ventricle’s contractile force; cardiac output,

processing (LeDoux, 2003).

the amount of blood in liters pumped by the heart per minute; and total peripheral resistance, an index of net constriction versus dilation in the arterial system’ (Seery et al., 2009,
p. 309). Seery was also able to show that task engagement, when assumed to contain both
perceptions of a challenge and a threat, was characterised by an increase in heart rate and a
decrease in the pre-ejection period from baseline measurements, as well as more significant
changes in both after inducing greater task engagement (see Figure 1.2).

Figure 1.2: The Biopsychosocial Model.

Using the model to understand changes in the physiological markers associated with challenge and threat perception in sport science, Blascovich et al. (2004) evaluated the predictive
validity between the induced motivational states in student athletes. They asked 27 baseball
and softball team members to take part in a laboratory test, where each had to undergo a
5 min baseline measure and two 2 min performance tasks, first giving a speech about playing their sport, their quality of performance outcome (measured by the points achieved) and

26

Chapter 1. Introduction

the performance expectation for the upcoming season (emotionally-loaded task). In another
task, they had to give a speech about the general qualities a friend should have (emotionally non-loaded task). During both tasks, the authors monitored the athletes’ impedance
cardiographs, electrocardiography and blood pressure. The results showed that the physiological challenge/threat markers significantly predicted the athletes’ perception of their
performances (positive versus negative), as well as the anticipated performance outcomes
for the subsequent season. In contrast, the outcome for the emotionally non-loaded task was
different in that no relationship between perception and physiological markers was found.
Based on these results Seery (2011, p. 536) stated that ‘. . . the cardiovascular responses associated with challenge/threat do not equate to challenge/threat itself, but instead represent
an indirect measure of the underlying psychological state.’
Overall, the Biopsychosocial Model holds great promise for providing an in-depth understanding of the distinctive differences between positive and negative performance stress.
Nevertheless, studies that support this theoretical framework for use in music psychology
have yet to be conducted. Thus, while an extension of the Biopsychosocial Model to the
domain of sport science has already been developed, future studies should evaluate the
validity of the model for performance science and also consider the impact of musicians’
self-focus when analysing the perception of challenges and threats prior to an upcoming
performance.8

8 The

extension of the Biopsychosocial Model in sport science is known as the Theory of Challenge and Threat
States in Athletes (TCTSA), and acknowledges competition and facilitating or debilitating competitive anxiety
in the field of sport psychology. It emphases the mediating effect of resource appraisals, such as self-efficacy,
power of control, goal relevance and emotional state, to predict the effects of perceiving challenges or threats
and performance outcomes.

Personal background and interest in performance stress

Personally, I was intrigued to know more about performance stress, in particular the stress
evaluation over time and its affect on your body and mind. I am a musician myself and I
remember vividly the performance that triggered my interest in studying performance science. It was a public performance, and after eight months of non-stop practice working on
the same three pieces I was now standing in front of a packed hall waiting for my performance to begin. I had woken up early and even had my breakfast out ready to devour at
7am: A banana and smoothie containing blackberries and porridge. I had researched all the
food to make sure it wouldn’t make me more hyperactive or too alert. Arriving at university
I got into my concert gear but did not put any shoes on as I had discovered that I preferred
to play bare foot. As I waited for people to come in, I made sure that I did not speak to
anyone at risk of them saying things that would make nervous. As I walked on stage I felt
amazingly calm and began to play my unaccompanied Bach. ‘WOW’ I thought to myself I
did it and it was good. Now the next one. Brahms. Feeling more and more confident as I
played these phrases I started to move more freely and actually smiled. Then all of a sudden
my fingers started doing the wrong thing—it was as if they had completely forgotten all the
patterns I had worked tirelessly to learn. Oddly my bow kept moving and as a stumbled
through the next few bars I found my way back eventually. All those hours of practice, all
those tears memorising the music, all that extra preparation with what to wear and what to
eat seemed wasted. I felt hugely disappointed but simply could not imagine how I would
have done it differently. The next day I boarded a flight to America and spent the next eight
hours digesting my performance. It was during that flight that I became determined to look
at the physiological and psychological aspects of performance in order to understand more
about performance stress, in particular pre-performance and its effect on body and mind.

I went on to study Psychology whilst carrying on playing the violin, I was then lucky enough
to integrate the two subjects when I came to the Royal College of Music to start my PhD and
later on my work as Graduate Teaching Assistant. I was fascinated about the musicians’

28

Chapter 1. Introduction

experiences and I wanted to open up a conversation with musicians about their vulnerability towards performance stress, whether it was perceived as something debilitating or gave
them the alertness needed to deliver a good performance. I just wanted to make sure that
the subject of performance stress was not missed or ignored. The time as a Graduate Teaching Assistant allowed me to gain experience through the preparation of classes—and the
assistance to the professor—but, most of all, to benefit from the close contact with the students. I hoped to learn as much from their doubts and questions as I was from the exchange
of thoughts and ideas.
Being a psychologist with a musical background working with musicians, themselves interested in psychology, allowed for very productive and inspiring interactions and led to new
perspectives for both the musicians and myself. As a psychology student, I got introduced
to the topics of consciousness, learning strategies, categorisation of knowledge, as well as visual and auditory perception. Given my interest in auditive perception, I decided to develop
a learning programme for my Masters thesis that would support non-musicians—as well as
musicians—in achieving specific competencies in music perception; in my case, I focused on
the perception of various brass- and woodwind instruments. The result showed that nonmusicians were able to improve in a manner that is comparable not with experts but rather
with semi-experts. Indeed, the finding suggested that regardless of society or educational
level, everyone has the potential to learn to perceive music similarly than musicians do.
Studying at the Royal College of Music was a great opportunity to share my enthusiasm towards music psychology and get new insights from others (musicians and psychologists) in
the field. It allowed for a flexible yet challenging learning environment, conducive to good
results. When I started my PhD at Royal College of Music I attempted to get in contact with
as many musicians from all musical backgrounds, performance interests and experiences as
possible. It was then when I decided to focus on the impact of performance stress on physiological responses, but also to be keen on finding a way to give musicians an opportunity to
practice and experience ‘performance stress’ whilst not being at risk of being judged. I was
intrigued when I heard about the Centre for Performance Science building a state-of-the-art
simulation training for musicians and I was keen to get involved and collect my data around

1.1. Personal background and interest in performance stress

29

it. Having developed my own training programme for non-musicians during my Masters, I
perceived this as an ideal challenge to combine music and technology further.
The aim of this simulation was to provide salient cues from real-life performance
situations—in this case, a virtual audience and audition. The environments were designed
on the principles of ‘distributed simulation’, in which only a selective abstraction of environmental features are provided. The aim was to generate back-stage and on-stage environments using appropriate lighting and sound cues (e.g., CCTV footage of the audience
displayed backstage and spot-lights and curtains on stage), as well as realistic, interactive
virtual audiences of different types and sizes. The simulator was designed along the principles of distributed simulation (i.e., low-cost and portable, with high fidelity) to operate in
two modes: (1) a recital with 24 virtual audience members; and (2) an audition situation
with three ‘expert’ virtual judges. Having never come across such tool to train and understand performance stress, I was keen on developing and using the simulation further in
order to monitor musicians’ physiological and psychological stress responses, in particular
in changes in the musicians’ heart rate variability and their feelings of anxiety.
In addition to my PhD at the Royal College of Music, I initiated a partnership with researchers from the Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, U.K.
that allowed me to gain expertise in signal processing using analysis tools such as Matlab.
This collaboration continued throughout my PhD, followed by a position as a visiting researcher and later on as a research assistant, during which I contributed to the execution
of three projects: (1) the impact of sleep deprivation on electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and cognitive performance outcome; (2) the evaluation of electrocardiographic data and
EEG data in neonates with pre-natal brain injuries; and (3) the detection of quantifiable ECG
metrics to identify stress states.
The first project assessed the efficacy of different EEG monitors for detecting sleep and wake
in real-world environments, and the impact of sleep deprivation on changes in EEG activities and cognitive performance outcomes. In particular, for the cognitive performance task,
the effect of sleep deprivation on reaction time (psychomotor vigilance task) and informa-

30

Chapter 1. Introduction

tion processing (Stroop Test) was put under scrutiny. My responsibilities for this project
involved the design of the cognitive performance protocol, the development of standardised questionnaires that supports changes in EEG patterns in response to sleep deprivation,
and the guidance of a PhD student throughout the development of the study design.
The second project sought to identify quantifiable metrics of the electrical activity of the
heart to detect and prevent hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, a brain injury caused by oxygen deprivation, or asphyxia. To this end, this project aimed to establish preventative mechanisms through the collection, analysis and interpretation of EEG and ECG signals in foetuses and neonates during their first 12 hours after birth. I collected first pilot data and
carried out a systematic review of the existing literature on the utility of early heart rate
variability in predicting brain injury and/or adverse neuro-developmental outcomes after
neonatal encephalopathy.
In my last project, which was particularly important for my work as a PhD student at the
Royal College of Music, I focused on ECG and stress detection and closely examined the
relationship between physiological stress and structural complexity of heart rate variability
in response to real-life performance scenarios. The framework included R-peak detection,
heart rate variability detrending and the evaluation of quantitative heart rate variability
metrics that are related to changes in the autonomic nervous system and the sympatho-vagal
balance (for more details, see Chapter 2). Scenarios of interest were public performances
(presentation and musical performance) and the application of stress indices in finance—
with the aim to determine characteristics of financial indices related to human stress levels,
and to establish a robust metric for the extent of ‘stress’ of the financial system.
Overall my work as a research assistant included the quantification and interpretation of
physiological and psychological data using SPSS and Matlab, and the design of protocols
and establishment of interdisciplinary experiments. Working at the department of Electrical
and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College London allowed me to liaise with researchers
from the field of Health Science. Electrical and Electronic Engineering and Health Science
have a distinctively different understanding of how to conduct experiments and to analyse

1.2. Overview of the thesis

and present data using qualitative and quantitative measures. The responsibility to correspond between departments equipped me with the skills to coordinate and deliver performance outcomes by means of weekly tutorials and training sessions, in which I explained
research content and methods in a straightforward fashion, allowing a mutual understanding for every research group involved.
All these experiences led to the development of my thesis in its current state; conducting
my PhD thesis enabled me to gain expertise in performance science as well as electrical and
electronic engineering, and I can with confidence say that my PhD thesis is a product of
both, developed with great passion and dedication over the last four years.

1.2

Overview of the thesis

The overview of this thesis is as follows:
Having provided a detailed review of the concept of stress and the stress of music performance, including a published review of Dianna Kenny’s book The Psychology of Music Performance Anxiety (Aufegger, 2013), the next chapter is dedicated to the assessment of performance stress in music, as well as methodological approaches to measuring and quantifying
music performance stress. In particular, standard and state-of-the-art methods (Frequency
domain analysis and multiscale sample entropy [MSE], respectively) for studying the physiological parameter, heart rate variability, is reviewed. Standard heart rate variability frequency domain analysis allows the division of the electrocardiographic (ECG) signal into
clinically relevant frequency components, with the low frequencies (LF:0.04 −0.15 Hz) and
the high frequencies (HF:0.15 −0.4 Hz) assumed to reflect the sympathetic nervous system
(SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), respectively. Multiscale sample entropy (MSE) is a method which is particularly suited to examine structural complexity of
time series, as it calculates entropy values directly from data; subsequently, the calculated
entropy is evaluated over increasing scales (degree of averaging of non-overlapping windows in a time series). For example, a signal with no structure (white noise) will exhibit

32

Chapter 1. Introduction

highest standard entropy (scale 1) which will then decrease with the increase in scale factor
– a signature of eta with low structural complexity; on the contrary, signals with tremendous
amounts of structure (e.g., pink noise) will have lower entropy than white data but will keep
those levels high with an increase in scale.
Chapters 3 and 4 report a novel investigation of the physiological responses to low- and
high-stress performance situations and before and during the performance from the perspective of a case study and music students. In Chapter 3, the physiological response of
an expert musician was evaluated in low stress (a rehearsal) and high stress (a recital for
400 people) performance conditions and along a piece of music of varying difficulty. Chapter 4 offers further insights into the degree and peak of cardiovascular reactivity between
low- and high-stress performances. Musicians’ heart rate variability was monitored during
a 5-minute pre-performance period and during a low- and high-stress performance; selfreported anxiety was collected prior to the events. The heart rate variability was again examined in terms of standard and state-of-the-art analyses.
Chapter 5 introduces a new approach to managing performance stress and enhance performance preparation. For this, a simulated performance space developed by the Centre
for Performance Science, Royal College of Music, was employed. The simulated performance space is a training tool that combines a virtual reality display with key features of a
real environment. The aim of this research was to design and test the efficacy of simulated
performance environments in which conditions of real performance could be recreated. Advanced violin students were recruited to perform in two simulations: a solo recital with a
small virtual audience and an audition situation with three ‘expert’ virtual judges. Each
simulation contained back-stage and on-stage areas, life-sized interactive virtual observers,
and pre- and post-performance protocols designed to match those found at leading international performance venues. Participants completed a questionnaire on their experiences of
using the simulations.
In Chapter 6, further elaboration of musicians’ perceptions and experiences of using simulated performance environments is provided. Conservatoire students performed in two sim-

1.2. Overview of the thesis

33

ulations: a recital with a virtual audience and an audition with virtual judges. Qualitative
data were collected through a focus group interview and written reflective commentaries.
In Chapter 7, data from twelve musicians who performed twice in the simulated environment are reported: once in front of three ‘judges’ providing positive facial and behavioural
feedback and once displaying negative facial and behavioural feedback. The heart rate variability was monitored throughout the performance including a 5-minute pre-performance
period while self-reported anxiety was assessed before and after. The heart rate variability
was again examined in terms of standard frequency and MSE methods.
Chapter 8 summarises the main findings of the thesis, addresses limitations, and offers new
directions for further research.

Literature review

Having discussed the general concept of stress alongside emotion-specific autonomic behaviour, the next sections provide a literature review in order to understanding how these
changes are expressed in musical performance contexts, the methodological considerations
of assessing performance stress and a justification as to why I chose a particular method
based on the review aforementioned.

Literature review—Performance stress in conservatoire students

Performance stress appears regardless of age and expertise and has been shown to appear
alongside feelings of anxiety and increased physiological responses such as heart rate. The
next sections provide a literature review of what has been done in examining performance
stress, in particular in conservatoire students. The review ends with a summary of the findings (Table 2.1 and 2.2) as well as an explanation of my method chosen. In addition, at the
end of this chapter, I provide a short digression concerning performance stress in young and
professional musicians in order to offer a complete overview of the stress research that has
been done in performance science.
A first study investigating physiological responses in music students was done by Craske
and Craig (1984). They asked 40 21-year-old piano students to perform a memorised piece
both alone and in front of an audience (consisting of peer students). Questionnaires admin36

istered were the Confidence as a Performer Scale (Appel, 1976), the SAI-Y1 (Spielberger et
al., 1983) and the Expectations of Personal Efficacy for Musicians Scale (sub scales; level and
strength of self-efficacy: Kendrick, Craig, Lawson, & Davidson, 1982). All three were completed 10-15 minutes prior to the performance. Furthermore, the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (Wolpe, 1969) given before and after the performance, as well as the Performance
Anxiety Self-statement Scale (Kendrick et al., 1982)—completed after the performance, was
collected. Heart rate was monitored at 10-second intervals 100, 40, and 10 seconds prior to
and 120, 140, 260 and 400 seconds after the first note played. Skin-resistance level was taken
one minute before and after the first note was played and one minute prior to the final note.
Breaths per minute were calculated for two time periods: (1) from the start of the recording
until the first note played; and (2) from the first note played until the end of the performance.
Prior to the analysis, participants were grouped into low- and high-anxious musicians. Multivariate analysis demonstrated an effect of group and condition (performance alone versus
in front of an audience), with high-anxious musicians showing higher levels of state anxiety, negative self-statements, as well as lower levels and strength of self-efficacy. Performing alone and in front of an audience caused a significant effect on the state anxiety scores
and the Subjective Units of Distress Scale. High-anxious musicians produced significantly
lower scores on self-efficacy when performing alone and in front of an audience, whereas
no such effect was found in low-anxious musicians. Significantly higher heart rate, skin resistance and responses and breathing was detected during the performance in front of the
audience than when performing alone, while no group effect for heart rate and breathing
was observed. Looking at groups separately, significant correlations between psychological
and physiological measures were detected between high-anxious musicians, heart rate during both the private and public performance, self-efficacy and the Retrospective Subjective
Units of Distress Scale.

Abel and Larkin (1990) asked 22 20-year-old music students (no indication of the instrument
played) to perform in a laboratory setting (baseline measure) followed by a performance
in front of a jury (between two to seven private teachers/assistants), two to six weeks afterwards. Questionnaires given were the abbreviated State and Trait Anxiety Inventory,

38

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations

state form (Spielberger et al., 1983), the Personal Report of Confidence as a Performer (Appel, 1976) and a quick self-report on confidence. All questionnaires were completed before,
while the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory-state form was also administered after the performance. The baseline measure consisted of a 6-minute period where students had to sit
quietly while heart rate and blood pressure was taken. No performance was required, instead participants had to carry out an arithmetic test, followed by a 6-minute resting period,
a concepts challenge and another 6-minute resting period. The heart rate was taken 12 times
per minute throughout the baseline measure and five minutes (i.e., warm up period) and
two minutes (i.e., call to go on stage) prior to the performance. Blood pressure was taken
four times during the 5-minute heart rate monitoring. Results demonstrated significantly
higher scores for the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory-state form in the two anticipatory
periods compared to the baseline measure and no difference neither for the Personal Report
of Confidence as a Performer nor for the self-report on confidence. Heart rate and blood
pressure (diastolic and systolic) was significantly increased from the baseline measure to the
first to the second anticipatory period. The second period was significantly positively correlation between the heart rate and the Personal Report of Confidence as a Performer, while a
negative correlation occurred between the heart rate and the self-report on confidence.

Fredrikson and Gunnarsson (1992) assessed performance stress, heart rate and endocrinological reactions, including cortisol, and (nor-)epinephrine in performances by string players. Psychological assessment was carried out by the Personal Report of Confidence as a
Musician—a questionnaire based on the Report of Confidence as a Speaker (Paul, 1966), dividing the sample into low-anxious and high-anxious musicians. Heart rate was monitored
for three minutes before the performance (while sitting), the first six minutes during the performance (standing), and three minutes after the performance (sitting). Endocrine measures
were collected via urine samples one hour before and 30 minutes after musicians were asked
to perform in two conditions: with no audience and in a public concert. Peak heart rate was
detected during both no audience and the public concert. While a group effect (low- versus
high-anxious musicians) was found for heart rate and self-reports, with higher degrees of
reactivity exhibited for high-anxious musicians, no such pattern occurred for the endocrino-

2.1. Literature review

39

logical responses. Significantly elevated endocrinological responses were detected prior to
the public performance compared with the no audience condition, as well as significantly
lower levels of self-confidence.
Brotons (1994) compared an open versus a double blind jury condition in 64 24-year-old
music students playing different instruments. For the open jury condition, students were
asked to perform in front of a jury, whereas the double blind jury condition consisted of
an audio recording of students’ performance that was rated by evaluators, where both the
students and the evaluators had no information about each other. Psychological stress responses were investigated by the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory-state form (Spielberger
et al., 1983). Heart rate was monitored prior to and during performance, including the monitoring of a non-performance day as baseline comparison. The results demonstrated significantly increased State and Trait Anxiety Inventory-state form and heart rate during both jury
conditions compared with the baseline measurement, while no difference between the jury
conditions was found. No indication of peak heart rate (before or during the performance)
was provided.
Yoshie, Kudo, Murakoshi, and Ohtsuki (2009) investigated 18 20-year-old pianists performing a piece from memory during a rehearsal and a competition. A visual analogue mood
scale (Cella & Perry, 1986) was filled out before each condition, while heart rate, sweat rate,
and electromyographic activity of upper extremity muscles was monitored (and sampled at
1000 Hz) during the performance. The results revealed that the self-reported anxiety was
significantly higher prior to the jury condition than the rehearsal condition, an effect that
was also seen in during the competition in the heart rate and the sweat rate. Furthermore, a
greater electromyographic magnitude was found for the competition condition. No correlation analysis was carried out.
Studer et al. (2012) asked 67 23-year-old students playing different instruments to attend to a
baseline measure and a private and a public performance, including an audience of approximately 10 members of peers and two experts. The State and Trait Anxiety Inventory-state
form (Spielberger et al., 1983) was given before the performance, while subjective reports on

40

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations

affective and physiological symptoms (e.g., anxiety, tension, shortness of breath) were administered before and after a 10-minute pre-performance period. Physiological assessment
prior to the performance included the partial pressure of end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2 ), heart rate
and heart rate variability, minute ventilation (V’E), the percentage of ribcage contribution to
the inspiratory volume (%RC), the tidal volume variability (TVV ), the inspiratory time (TI ),
expiratory time (TE ), total breath duration (TTOT ), the duty cycle (TI /TTOT ), indicating inspiratory timing, the inspiratory volume (VI ), the mean inspiratory flow, which is an index of
inspiratory drive (VT /TI ), and the physical activity (accelerometer data). The State and Trait
Anxiety Inventory-state form was significantly higher before the public compared to the
private performance. This was also confirmed by self-reports on physical symptoms. Students with higher MPA scored higher in both inventories during the public performance. A
significant increase was, furthermore, found in heart rate variability, TE , TTOT and TI /TTOT
during the high-stress condition. Neither an increase in PETCO2 was detected nor a significant correlation between MPA scores and physical features was observed.

Methodological considerations

Heart rate variability

Overall, studies have shown that musicians experience increased heart rate either before
or during performance or both in front of an audience and audition panel, respectively.
The heart rate was significantly different from the rehearsal and musicians’ baselines and
occurred typically alongside elevated feelings of anxiety.
Based on the studies available, however, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the degree and timing of musicians’ cardiovascular reactivity to acute psychosocial stress for at
least two methodological reasons. Firstly, the studies conducted reported heart rate rather
than heart rate variability. Standard heart rate variability analysis allows the division of the
electrocardiographic (ECG) signal into clinically relevant components associated with the
sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The importance of
analysing heart rate variability became evident when variability was found to be a strong
predictor of mortality after an acute myocardial infarction (Malik et al., 1996).
Secondly, studies in music to date have examined different pre-performance periods, ranging anywhere from 100 s to 5 min beforehand, and have monitored heart rate at different
intervals, which impacts the capacity to detect subtle changes. Recordings of heart rate and
specifically variability, however, should be standardised to a minimum of 5-minute epochs
to assure consistent assessment across studies.
These recommendations were formulated by the European Society of Cardiology in collaboration with the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (Malik et al., 1996).
Both successfully constituted a Task Force with the main aim to develop standards of defining common terms in cardiovascular research, specifying standard methods of measurement
and to determine future areas of research. Members of the Task force contain researchers
across a wide range of different expertise, including the fields of mathematics, engineering,
physiology, and clinical medicine. Their guideline allows appropriate comparisons and ob-

servations, promote and in-depth understanding and interpretations, and inspire to lead to
further progress across different research fields.

How to collect and analyse heart rate variability

Bio-signals refer to any signals that have a biological/biomedical origin. This can imply
electrical activity from the heart (ECG), endocrinological responses, electrical activity from
the body’s muscles (EMG) and electrical activity from the brain (EEG). Current technological
tools allow a rigorous and precise assessment of these bio-signals, however, they also came
alongside a variety of different methodological considerations for a meaningful interpretation. The next sections look at these considerations, discussing the optimal steps required
for a sufficient data acquisition, effective ways of signal processing, and the appropriate
methods to analyse them.
Heart rate variability is usually monitored by the electrocardiogram (ECG), a non-invasive
method that detects the regularity of beat-to-beat (R-R) fluctuations (Berntson & Cacioppo,
2004). ECG captures the atrial depolarisation (P wave), the depolarisation of the right and
left ventricles (QRS complex) and the recovery of the ventricles (T wave), with another P
wave completing the full cycle. The index of interest is the R-R intervals—the time difference between one ventricular depolarisation to another (Kamath, Watanabe, & Upton, 2013).
ECGs can be obtained using electrodes placed on the skin’s surface that either are physically
connected to an external recording device or connected by a wireless belt equipped with
sensors and strapped around designated body locations. The signal is then transformed
from a continuous signal into a discrete one (Malik et al., 1996). The accuracy of the signal
depends on the recorded sampling frequency, known as the number of samples per unit of
time, and the adequate preparation of the equipment to monitor the user (e.g., low sampling frequencies (100 Hz) lack a complete reconstruction of the recorded signal (Kamath et
al., 2013).1
1 The

sampling frequency of ECG should be of at least 250 Hz (Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem: Malik
et al., 1996; Nyquist, 1928). No benefits are gained of sampling above 2000 Hz.

44

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations

In the research reported in this thesis, I collected R-R intervals by means of the The Zephyr
BioHarness (ADinstruments). The Zephyr BioHarness (weight 35g; 80x40x15 mm) is a simple belt (50g, 50 mm width) with electrode sensors accommodated within the chest strap that
captures heart rate, breathing frequency, skin temperature, activity and posture in real time
or offline. It further possesses is an internal memory of 480 hours and a battery life up to
10 hours. The equipment contains great potential for the evaluation of stress signatures and
has been shown reasonable adequate in terms of reliability and validity. This was shown
by two studies carried out by Johnstone, Ford, Hughes, Watson, and Garrett (2012b) and
Johnstone, Ford, Hughes, Watson, and Garrett (2012a). In both studies, they compared heart
rate, breathing frequency, accelerometers and skin temperature measured by the BioHarness
with other well-established devices, such as the Polar T31 (Polar Electro, Kemple, Finland)
or a face respiration mask called Spirometer (version 3B; Cortex Medical, Germany). Ten
participants were asked to complete a simple treadmill protocol designed by the authors.
The results showed a strong correlation between the assessed variables and the subjects,
making the BioHarness an effective tool collecting, processing and evaluating bio-signals.2
Other factors adulterating the quality of the data are artifacts or ectopic beats (considering
a healthy subject). The former are occurring beats outside of the patterns of the R-R fluctuations, the latter are extra beats that results in shortened R-R intervals, a compensational
delay and an extended R-R interval, leading to a minimised stroke volume that affects at
least 10-30 beats. Artifacts can be caused by:

• Power line interference
• Muscle contractions
2 Other

devices that have been developed and and appear promising by offering non-invasive and wirelessly working measurements is the ‘Droid Jacket’ or also so-called ‘Magic Vest’ (Foundation Don Gnocchi),
the ‘LifeShirt’ (VivoMetrics, Rae Systems) or ‘HealthVest’ (SmartLifeTech: Heilman & Porges, 2007). Studies
such as the one by Kent et al. (2009) compared the LifeShirt with the Polar belt (Sport Tester, RS600i, Kempele,
Finnland) and a pneumotachograph (COSMED quarkB2, Rome, Italy), and investigated variables such as respiratory rate, expiratory time and heart rate. The results revealed a low variation in respiratory rate between
devices, yet there was a significant effect in expiratory time and heart rate, in particular between the LifeShirt
and the pneumotachograph (COSMED quarkB2, Rome, Italy) during low exercise intensity. According to
the authors, future studies may apply the LifeShirt outside the laboratory setting, yet consider an additional
validation when assessing the cardiovascular output for low- to moderate stress exposure.

• Electrode contact noise
• Excessive body movement
• Baseline wandering
• Noise generated by electronic devices used in signal processing circuits
• Electrical interference external to the subject and recording system
• High-frequency noises in the ECG
• Breath, lung, or bowel sounds contaminating the heart sounds (PCG).

These additional noises may mislead the result if not spotted before further analysis (Nayak,
Soni, & Bansal, 2012).
Noise in heart rate variability data can be displayed by means of geometrical visualisation,
such as the Poincaré plot; a scatter plot that indicates the dynamic of the heart rate embedded in a two-dimensional visual graphic (Combatalade, 2010). Thus, each R-R fluctuation
is plotted against the next one and shows the deviations of short- and long-term R-R fluctuations. The plot (also called scattergram) can be evaluated quantitatively through the calculation of the standard deviation indexes of the plot, and provides a summary as well as a
detailed information of each beat-to-beat behaviour of the heart (Hsu et al., 2012). A healthy
heart displays a ‘. . . cigar-shaped cloud of points oriented along the line of identity’ (Voss,
Schulz, Schroeder, Baumert, & Caminal, 2009, p. 285) and a long-term standard deviation of
approximately 125 ms, while a reduction to 85 ms illustrates ventricular tachyarrhythmia.
If noise appears above a threshold of 2%, filter methods should be applied (Peltola, 2012).
The commonest filter methods are the Butterworth filter, the cubic spline interpolation and
the Median filter. The Butterworth filter is defined by two parameters: the cut-off frequency
and the order. While the cut off frequency delimits the boundary of the frequency within a
signal, the order determines the level of sharpness from pass band to stop band. Pass and
stop bands are represented by a range of frequencies, being either let through or rejected and

46

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations

produces—combined with the cut-off frequency—a monotonic filter response. The more
noise in the data, the higher the order that should be applied (Robertson & Dowling, 2003).
The cubic spline interpolation divides a signal into small subsections and connects approximations between oscillations (i.e., piecewise polynomial interpolation), reassuring an overall smoothness (Haghighi & Roohi, 2012).3 The median filter combines midpoint values of
the signal, making the data less vulnerable to outliers.4
The application of the filter methods depends on the quality of the date (e.g., for noisy data
with many outliers, the median filter is recommended). All three filter methods facilitate the
further processing of the ECG data according to the Task Force by means of: (1) Time domain
analysis (Billman, 2011; Malik et al., 1996); and (2) Frequency domain analysis (Kamath et
al., 2013).

Time domain analysis

The time domain analysis examines physiological signals and their progression with respect
to time. It determines the average R-R (or N-N) intervals (AVNN), their standard deviation
(SDNN), the root mean square of successive differences of R-R intervals (RMSSD) or the
(percentage of) difference between adjacent NN intervals that are greater than 50ms.5 Each
parameter gives insights into the degree of the sympatho-vagal balance (see Table 2.3). In a
relaxed state, for instance, the AVNN ranges between .6 and .8 seconds, with small SDNNs
and RMSSD and a larger percentage of NN50. Time domain analysis does not require a
high degree of ‘stationarity’ 6 of the data, it only provides an overall marker of the heart rate
variability, failing to investigate R-R intervals based on their frequency distribution (Kamath
et al., 2013; Malik, 1996; Stein et al., 1994).
3 Interpolation methods are also able to replace any abnormal R-R intervals by new interpolated R-R intervals (Peltola, 2012).
4 Another interesting filter is the FIR filter, which removes the data from baseline drift and high-frequency
noise. It filter between 0.5 and 35 Hz, using 8000 coefficients. Due to its stability and its simple application,
it makes it very attractive compared to other filter methods. However, the main disadvantage is the large
number of coefficients needed, making its application rather time-consuming (Lim, 1990; Rabiner & B., 1975).
5 N-N (Normal-to-Normal) and R-R (R wave-to-R wave) intervals are equivalent.
6 Stationary signal have probability distributions (statistical properties) which are constant in time.

Frequency domain analysis

The Frequency domain analysis investigates R-R fluctuations (i.e., heart rate variability) in
terms of their frequency spectrum (Kamath et al., 2013; Malliani, 1999). Stress is managed by
the autonomic nervous system (ANS). In particular, a reaction to stress can be characterised
by the interactions between two ANS components: the parasympathetic and sympathetic
nervous systems (PNS and SNS). The interaction between the sympathetic nervous system
and the parasympathetic nervous system (i.e., SNS/PNS) have been shown to influence the
temporal fluctuations of the peak-to-peak times in the electrocardiogram (ECG)—the R-to-R
(RR) interval, known as heart rate variability. The frequencies are detected from the power
spectral density (PSD), a measure that represents signals as frequency distributions. Established frequencies components consist of low frequencies (LF) and high frequencies (HF).
LFs are those observed between 0.04 −0.15 Hertz (Hz) and are associated with the SNS and
baroreceptor reflex (i.e., blood pressure). HFs (0.15 −0.4 Hz) are believed to provide information of the vagal modulation (i.e., PNS) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (alterations in
heart rate variability due to naturally occurring breathing: Berntson & Cacioppo, 2004). The
ratio between the LF and HF power, the LF/HF ratio, indicates the global sympathovagal
balance.7
7 In

long-term recording, a LF/HF ratio above 4.8 is considered to reflect the SNS and below 1.3 the PNS
activity (the baseline LF/HF value is considered to be around 1.2: Billman, 2013; Milicevic, 2005).

48

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations

Other less investigated frequencies are the ultra low (1.15x10-5 and 0.0033 Hz) and very
low frequencies (0.0033 and 0.04 Hz). Ultra low frequencies are assumed to reflect neuroendocrine rhythms and are obtained in long-term recordings. Very low frequencies are believed to define the renin-angiotensin system (i.e., blood pressure regulation), the chemoreceptor and the thermoregulatory activity.8 Within shorter recordings (5-10 minutes) it has
also been suggested to represent negative emotions, such as worry and rumination (Table
2.4: Berntson et al., 1997; Bilge et al., 1999; Cacioppo et al., 1994; Stein et al., 1994; Taylor &
Bogdan, 1998).
The minimum duration of ECG recordings should be of at least ‘. . . 10 times the wavelength
of the lower frequency bound of the investigated component’ (Malik et al., 1996, p. 13). For
instance, to process HF and LF, 1 to 2 minutes of data are required, while the calculation of
the ratio requires short-term recording of 5 minutes (Malik, 1996).

The most commonly applied methods to compute PSDs are the Fast Fourier Transformation

form in the year 1965. Since then linear filtering and Fourier transform has been a key application within the field of signal processing, including telecommunications, medical electronics, radar or radio astronomy (Duhamelm & Vetterli, 1990). The importance of the FFT
is highlighted in the data length, with the FFT enabling the length to be divided into subsections in order to apply its algorithm. The FFT usually assumes an a priori understanding
of frequency bands of interest. The AR is more complex to carry out, yet. . . decompose the
overall spectrum into single spectral components [. . . ] providing automatically the central
frequency and associated power without the need for a priori assumptions’ (Montano et
al., 2009, p. 73). The method used depends on the design of the study. Frequency domain
analysis requires ‘stationary’ data, and ideally an infinite number of samples. Heart rate
variability, however, is only collectable in blocks (or time windows) and contains outliers
(or non-harmonics) produced by artifacts or ectopic beats. This causes a ‘frequency leakage’, a misinterpretation of the data due to limited time windows and outliers. One way to
minimise frequency leakage is to filter the data. Lastly, frequency domain analysis offer a
better representation, however, their disadvantage is the requirement of a ‘. . . strong periodicity of the numerous superimposed short- and long-term physiological oscillations’ (Voss
et al., 1996, p. 420).

A new approach to analyse heart rate variability drawn from complexity science
Measures used in complexity science are non-linear and based on the concept that systems
are unpredictable, complex and infinitely diverse. To date, systems have been viewed as
a product of a clear-cut cause-and-effect link that is determined by negative feedback and
the goal of maintaining or regaining equilibrium (i.e., homeostasis). In doing so, outcomes
are determined, intentional and chosen (Stacey, 1995). Most phenomena, however, are more
complex—producing responses that are partly emergent and partly intentional, caused by
spontaneous self-organization and creative self-destruction. They can be unexpected and
disorderly, driven by negative but also positive feedback. The domain of complexity science
considers and evaluates these aspects by investigating the biosignal in terms of linearity, disorder (i.e., complexity) and magnitude (i.e., scale)—determined by: (1) abrupt alterations; (2)

50

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations

nonlinear oscillations; (3) complexity; (4) self-similar dynamics (i.e., fractal anatomies); or (5)
hysteresis. Abrupt alterations are sudden onsets of a seizure or irregular oscillation, which
cause unexpected changes (i.e., bifurcations: Goldberger, 1996, 2006; Goldberger, Rigney, &
West, 1990). These changes are furthermore regulated by a complex network and feedback
system, including fractal anatomies, self-similar dynamics and past input (Goldberger et al.,
2002).
Fractals anatomies and self-similar dynamics are referred as to ‘. . . irregular geometric objects that display self-similarity’ (Goldberger et al., 2002, p. 2466). Fractal anatomies encompass a wide composition of (sub-)units at different scales, resembling the larger unit in
dynamic and structure (i.e., self-similar dynamic). This can be found in natural phenomena,
such as mountain ranges, coast lines, but also DNA, blood and pulmonary vessels, heart
rate, or even psychological subjective perception (Pincus & Goldberger, 1994; Tan, 2013). In
terms of cardiovascular physiology, fractals can be structural, including vascular, muscular, electrical, and connective tissue characteristics and dynamical, such as the regulation of
the heartbeat fluctuations ore the beat-to-beat pressure fluctuations (Iannaccone & Khokha,
1996). Both have the main function of quick and effective transport over complex, spatially
distributed networks (Goldberger et al., 2002). With age, disease, or other exposure to maladaptive circumstances, these structures have been shown to degeneration in terms of their
structural complexity. Usually, cardiac fractal-like processes generate irregular fluctuations,
which exhibit self-similar properties across multiple time scales. Studies evaluating this
‘scaling behaviour’, however, have shown that both short and long-range (fractal) correlation properties are significantly altered, resulting in a loss of structural complexity. As such,
with increased age or disease, both short and long-range (fractal) properties significantly
alter, resulting in a loss of structural complexity (Costa, Goldberger, & Peng, 2002).
R-R fluctuations have been, so far, quantified either deterministically (i.e., predictably) or
stochastically (i.e., randomly). While the former is expressed in mathematical terms, excluding ‘latent’ and unpredictable parameters (e.g., noise), the latter describes the system
by its probabilities. However, according to complexity science, cardiovascular outputs
are most likely a combination of both, involving a ‘. . . multitude of spatial and temporal

2.1. Literature review

51

scales. . . [which helps to be]. . . more adaptive. . . [towards]. . . external changes’ (Thuraisingham & Gottwald, 2006, p. 2). The degree of complexity can be evaluated using, for instance,
sample entropy measures.

Sample Entropy A family of statistical measures, named approximate entropy, was introduced by Pincus (1991) in order to quantify the regularity of short and noisy time series.
The concept is based on the computation of frequency of occurrence of similar patterns in the
data, whereby a pattern is defined by data segments of equal length called the delay vectors.
The length of these delay vectors reflects physical properties in the data, such as the embedding dimension and ‘sufficient information’. The similarity of two delay vectors is assessed
based on their distance and a ratio of a number of similar delay vectors and the total number
of delay vectors (for a given distance) plays the role of relative frequency, a concept closely
related to probability. The original approximate entropy algorithms considers self-matching
sequences, to avoid the problem of ln(0) in the calculations, however, this introduces bias
in the entropy value which makes approximate entropy overly sensitive to the length of the
time series. To mitigate the lack of consistency in the approximate entropy estimates, Richman and Moorman (2000) introduced the sample entropy algorithm, which calculates the
conditional probability that two sequences of m consecutive data points, which are similar
to within a tolerance level r, will remain similar when the next consecutive points are included (self-matches are not considered). This modification makes sample entropy largely
independent of the length of a time series length and equips it with additional consistency
over a wide range of dynamically diverse time series and operating parameters.
For time series { x (n)} = { x (1), x (2), . . . , x ( N )}, the SampEn can be calculated based on the
following steps:

1. Initially, ( N − m) delay vectors of embedding dimension m are formed as Xm (i ) =

[ x (i ), x (i + 1), . . . , x (i + m − 1)] where i = 1, 2, . . . , N − m. These delay vectors represent m consecutive values of a data stream x, commencing with the i-th point.
2. The distance between any two delay vectors Xm (i ) and Xm ( j) is defined as the maxi-

52

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations
mum norm:

d [ Xm (i ), Xm ( j)] = max {| x (i + k − 1) − x ( j + k − 1)|} .
k=1,...,m

3. For a given Xm (i ), the number of similar delay vectors is counted (1 ≤ j ≤ N − m, j 6=
i ), denoted as Bi , such that d [ Xm (i ), Xm ( j)] ≤ r.
4. For 1 ≤ i ≤ N − m, the quantities Bim (r ) =

1
N −m−1 Bi

and Bm (r ) =

1
N −m

∑iN=−1 m Bim (r )

are calculated.
5. Similarly, Bim+1 (r ) and Bm+1 (r ) are calculated for the embedding dimension m + 1.
6. Thus, physically Bm (r ) is the probability that a similar pattern will be found in the set
of delay vectors with embedding dimension m, whereas Bm+1 (r ) is the probability that
two sequences will match for m + 1 points.
7. Finally, Sample entropy is computed by:
B m +1 ( r )
SampEn(r, m, N ) = − ln
B m (r )




where r is the tolerance level, m is the pattern length and N is the length of the time
series.
Note that a comparison of structural complexity among time series can only be performed
for fixed values of r, m and N. The parameter r is usually set as a small percentage of standard deviation of the original time series. This equips sample entropy with scale invariance,
that is, robustness to uniform scaling of signal magnitudes or DC offset. Various theoretical
and empirical studies have shown that the recommended parameter values: m = 1 or 2 for
the embedding dimension, r = [0.1, 0.25] for the percentage of standard deviation, and 10m
to 20m data points, provide sufficiently reliable sample entropy estimates.
In summary, the entropy measures evaluate biosignals in terms of their degree of ‘regularity’
and ‘complexity’ (Voss et al., 1996, 2009). First introduced by Pincus (1991), aiming to improve the Kolmogorov entropy notions—an approach that is more suitable for phenomena

2.1. Literature review

53

of less dimensionality—his ‘approximate entropy’ calculates the likelihood of patterns that
appear to be similar. While healthy participants exhibit an approximate entropy of heart
rate complexity ranging around 1.0, patients that suffered a myocardial infarction reveal an
approximate entropy of approximately 1.2 (Mäkikallio et al., 1999). A modified version of
the approximate entropy is the sample entropy. The sample entropy evaluates sequences of
heart rate dynamics based on their degree of similarity (within a pre-defined tolerance), as
well as whether the degree remains stable after e.g., a consecutive data point has been included. Low sample entropy refers to extreme regular physiological time series, high sample
entropy represents more complexity and highest sample entropyE are usually assumed to
occur in stochastic physiological data (Pincus, 1991; Pincus & Goldberger, 1994; Weippert,
Behrens, Rieger, & Behrens, 2014). Decreased sample entropy has been shown to appear
alongside cardiovascular diseases (Shin et al., 2006; Tuzcu, Nas, Borklu, & Ugur, 2006), aging (Takahashi et al., 2008) and performance stress (Williamon, Aufegger, Wasley, Looney, &
Mandic, 2013). Both the approximate entropy and the sample entropy, however, require stationary and noise-free data and are dependent on the data windowing and outliers and only
evaluate one scale (Voss et al., 2009). Moreover, sample entropy methods have been extensively used to assess the complexity and regularity of physiological time series. However,
it has been shown that such methods may produce inconsistent results due to the involved
temporal fluctuation in physiological signals, which are not accounted for in these standard
algorithms.

Multiscale sample entropy The multiscale sample entropy extends the conventional sample entropy measure by allowing the investigation of the complexity of time series at different resolutions, or time scales (i.e., by setting a scale factor parameter: Costa et al., 2002).
Thus, multiscale sample entropy analyses are predicated upon the following: (1) the complexity of the human system is a reflection of a constantly changing environment and (2) can
be detected by exploring the underlying non-linear dynamics in biomarkers, such as heart
rate variability, at different scale factors (Gao et al., 2013). The multiscale sample entropy
assesses the structural richness of the data and has been able to demonstrate that: (1) great-

54

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations

est complexity—due to a high degree of correlated properties—is observed in healthy and
young subjects compared to their older counterparts; and (2) higher scale factors generated
a better discrimination coefficient between signals of different physiological states. As such,
multiscale sample entropy is able to distinguish between physiological time series with different degrees of complexity and more rigorous definitions of time scales (Ahmed & Mandic,
2012). Nevertheless, also the multiscale sample entropy requires clean and stationary data
and loses consistency as the amount of data points diminish (Voss et al., 2009).

Summary and approach used in this thesis Physiological signals, such as heart rate
variability are analysed by linear and non-linear methods, such as time domain analyses,
frequency domain analyses or entropy measures. Time domain analysis employs statistical (mean, standard deviation) or geometric methods to inform about a physiological
state. Frequency domain analysis investigated specific frequency bands and their amplitude. The most commonly investigated frequency bands are the low and high frequencies,
both associated with the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system and indicating the sympatho-vagal balance (Peltola, 2012). A more recent method is sample entropy
measures—a nonlinear methods derived from the complexity science. So far, (biological)
systems have been believed to work towards homeostasis by assuming a linear and high
predictable cause-effect outcome, generating a proportionate input or output. Complexity
science accuses these theories as too simple and one-sided. Instead, they propose a ‘homeostasis revisited’—a stability reached by a complex dynamic of stationarity, nonlinearity (i.e.,
unpredictable interactions within a system) and multiscaled organisation (i.e., fluctuation of
different fractal properties). The main aim of (multiscale) sample entropy is to detect dynamical structures and to develop predictive models and theoretical frameworks (Newman,
2003).
Noteworthy to mention, all three methods have their limitations; the time domain analysis
only offers a preliminary insight into heart rate variability; the frequency domain analysis
assumes to represent either the SNS or the PNS activity of the ANS, yet studies were not always in agreement within the condition tested. While the LF is believed to show increased

2.1. Literature review

55

power during physical and mental stressful tasks, a pronounced activity was also detected
during more relaxed conditions, such as sleep or deep breathing (Houle & Billman, 1999;
Rahman, Pechnik, Gross, Sewell, & Goldstein, 2011). Moreover, some studies observed an
opposite effect, a decreased LF power during taxing conditions (Billman, 2013). The sample entropy method offers a fruitful and sophisticated statistic to expand our knowledge of
cardiovascular oscillations and their alterations alongside increased age or cardiovascular
disease (Oxenham & Sharpe, 2003; Strait & Lakatta, 2012). Nevertheless, studies on sample entropy are inconsistent and while this method may lead to a deeper understanding
of cardiovascular data, it is not yet fully understood how this method is exactly related to
physiological control (Tan, 2013; Tan, Cohen, Eckberg, & Taylor, 2009).
Lastly, all three methods have been applied in previous research without the acknowledgement of the influence of breathing. Reasons for this are manifold: Firstly, the limitation of
adequate equipment makes it difficult to measure the breathing rate over a longer period
of time (Sobron, Romero, & Lopetegi, 2010). Secondly, the mechanism behind breathing
as well as its individual variations along time and volume dimensions are complex and
are particularly difficult to extract when playing an instrument (e.g., additional influence
of movements: Wientjes, 1992). Moreover, while the respiration sinus arrhythmia seems to
be ‘. . . well-preserved in young and healthy individuals, it is diminished in older individuals with various diseases whose conditions are complicated by cardiovascular diseases,
diabetes mellitus, and the like. In this context, the respiration sinus arrhythmia represents
a ‘cardiac age’ or a ‘cardio-pulmonary reserve [and should therefore be considered as an
additional signal processing approach when analysing cardiovascular responses to stress]’
(Yasuma & Hayano, 2004, p. 699).
In the studies that follow in this thesis, heart rate variability was analysed using the frequency domain analysis and the (multiscale) sample entropy analysis. The rationale for
choosing the frequency domain analysis and the (multiscale) sample entropy method is
based on the provided evidence of its feasibility based on the Task Force guidelines. The
Task Force contains of wide range of researchers with different expertise, including the fields
of mathematics, engineering, physiology, and clinical medicine, and offer a step by step ap-

56

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations

proach on how to collect, process and analyse cardiovascular data. In particular, they state
that ‘. . . although in principle these techniques [frequency domain analysis via Fast Fourier
Transform algorithms] have been shown to be powerful tools for characterisation of various
complex systems, no major breakthrough has yet been achieved by their application to biomedical data including heart rate variability analysis. It is possible that integral complexity
measures are not adequate to analyse biological systems and thus, are too insensitive to detect the non-linear perturbations of R-R interval which would be of physiological or practical importance’ (Malik et al., 1996, p. 363). The authors therefore encourage new differential
methods to analyse heart rate variability, such as the application of the (multiscale) sample
entropy. Indeed, the sample entropy is a powerful tool to understand the complexity of
a system, however, its approach to analyse heart rate variability in performance science is
yet to be studied (Malik et al., 1996). Based on these recommendations, I apply and compare
both the frequency domain analysis and the (multiscale) sample entropy in order to evaluate
their application and feasibility in performance science.

2.2

Psychological measures

Validity and reliability Psychological measures are nowadays a common method to explore emotional states in specific performance contexts.9 An example of a powerful tool that
addresses emotions are self-reports through means of questionnaires. Questionnaires contain a set of items that are normally rated on a Likert-Scale, with higher ratings indicating
a higher tendency of experiencing a specific sensation. However, to assure that the questionnaire provides you with meaningful information, it is important to evaluate its quality
through its psychometric properties, including the properties of validity and reliability (Hale
& Astolfi, 2011; Webb, Shavelson, & Haertel, 2006). Validity assesses whether the question9 This

was not always the case; before the cognitive revolution in the 50s and due to the emphasis on behaviours, bare interest in assessing subjective experiences was existent. This was particularly dominant for
stress related research as a) little knowledge about theoretical concepts on stress was available, b) ethical considerations of applying stress inducing conditions in a laboratory setting were raised. However, due to conceptual theoretical clarifications and progresses in stress related research, researchers have started to develop
scales that are able to detect stress-related emotional responses in a wide range of clinical and non-clinical
settings.

2.2. Psychological measures

57

naire measures what it aims to measure, while the reliability index provides information
about the (internal) consistency of the measure (Field, 2008).
For both reliability and validity, several sub-categories exist:
Content validity: Self-evident, content validity assesses whether the questionnaire measures
the content that it claims to measure. In doing so, the questionnaire should encompass
adequate items that cover the full range of the aimed construct measured and which are not
too similar to each other.
Construct validity: Construct validity describes the association between one (or more) constructs in order to explain specific phenomena. Though these constructs are not directly
assessable, the construct can be measured by its variables used. Nevertheless, the more
complex the construct is (unidimensional versus multidimensional), the more difficult is
its definition. Methods that can be used to test the construct validity may be a correlation
analysis between the variables (i.e., items) and the construct (i.e., total scores), a correlation analysis of the measurement given to two different groups, or a more advanced factor
analysis.
Criterion-related Validity: Criterion validity is assured when the degree of predictability (i.e.,
predictive validity) is consistent across a variety of different situations and highly correlated
with other established measurements, respectively. Another form is the concurrent validity,
which assesses the feasibility of one measurement of different length. Concurrent validity
further differentiate between convergent and discriminant validity. While former detects
the relation of two measurements, latter compares the administered measurement given to
different groups.
Test-Retest reliability or ‘Stability’: Test-Retest reliability refers to the requirement that a test
given several times to a sample over a certain period of time should generate a similar item
score. For instance, an IQ test given twice within two weeks should produce a stable score
for both occasions. This consistency can be assessed by the reliability coefficient, ranging
from 0 to 1.00, and should ideally be above a correlation (r) of .80 (Hale & Astolfi, 2011).

58

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations

Parallel or equivalent forms reliability: Parallel forms reliability is assured when two questionnaires measuring the same constructs are highly correlated with each other. Both the
parallel or equivalent forms reliability and the test-retest reliability measure the degree of
consistency; however, the latter does not provide an index across different measurements.
An additional form of the parallel or equivalent forms reliability is the delayed parallel or
equivalent forms reliability, where two parallel forms are given twice at two different occasions. The index of quality of the delayed parallel or equivalent is taken from the coefficient
of stability or equivalent coefficient aforementioned. The degree of reliability is, again, assessed by a reliability coefficient.
Internal-Consistency reliability: While both Test-Retest and parallel forms reliability are sufficient marker of the quality of measurements, they are rather inconvenient to assess. Instead,
the majority of research refers to the internal-consistency reliability, in particular the Cronbach’s alpha (α) coefficient (Cronbach, 2004). Several possibilities are available to compute the
internal-consistency reliability, such as by means of the Split half-reliability, which is equivalent to the parallel forms reliability and is calculated by splitting one full-length test into
halves—X1 and X2—and by estimating a correlation coefficient for both X1 and X2.
Inter-rater reliability: The inter-rater reliability evaluates the consistency of a measurement
not within but between subjects. This is particular valuable when it comes to performances
assessed by several external judgers. Here, the reliability index makes sure that, across all
judgers, similar outcomes are achieved.
A method that considers the evaluation of both validity and reliability is factor analyses.
Factor analyses are part of the Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and detect correlations
between items (i.e., multicollinearity) and between items and their underlying constructs
(Field, 2008). They may be carried out exploratory (EFA) or confirmatory (CFA); the former is ‘data-driven’ and applied if little knowledge about the theory exists. The CFA is
theory-driven and feasible for hypothesis testing, such as comparing the factorial structure
of a questionnaire. Both encompass two key concepts: the evaluation of the factorial variance and the factorial complexity (Munro, 2001). The factorial variance determines the most

2.2. Psychological measures

59

optimal factorial structure by assessing the: (1) shared variance between factors; and (2)
the variance that is specific to one factor. Factorial complexity represents the correlation
between a factor and each item (defined by the item loading characteristics). An item is,
ideally, reflected by one factor. However, items often show cross-loadings, making a clear
cut off between factors difficult. Further indications of the factorial structure are Eigenvalues
(i.e., preferably above 1, which is above average variance of the items) or percentages (e.g., a
factor accounted for 34% of the item variance.). To gather information about the Eigenvalue,
a factor rotation—or geometrical reorientation—must be applied. This can be of orthogonal
or oblique nature, both informing about the shared variance between factors, yet with the
latter assuming a correlation between factors—increasing the factorial complexity. The factorial structure offers an indication of the validity and reliability and can be assessed by
model-of-fit indexes, such as:
• Goodness of Fit-Index (GFI);
• Adjusted Goodness of Fit-Index (AGFI);
• Comparative Goodness of Fit-Index (C[G]FI);
• Chi-squared Test (X2 ); or
• Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA).
The GFI detects the discrepancy between the expected and the actual outcome of the factorial structure (ideally r>.9); the AGFI works similarly though is unaffected by latent variables
(ideally r>.9); the CFI functions independently of the sample size (ideally r>.9); the X2 examines the difference between expected and actually observed covariance matrixes (ideally
non-significant p<.05); and the RMSEA is a function of the X2 test and adjusts for small and
divergent samples (ideally r<.06). All these indexes allow the comparison of factorial structures, such as a one, two, three or four factor model with factors that are either correlated
or uncorrelated to each other, or factor models of first or second order, with the outcome of
the first order providing a theoretical ground for the second order (Ree, French, MacLeod,
& Locke, 2008).

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations

Methodological consideration and rationale

Performance stress may trigger a variety of emotions, ranging from positive to negative
feelings, such as joy and excitement or worry and anxiety. Most research focused on the
sensation of anxiety to address performance stress, using for instance the Music Performance
Anxiety Questionnaire (Cox & Kenardy, 1993), the Performance Anxiety Inventory by Nagel
(1990) or the recently developed Music Performance Anxiety Inventory (Kenny, Davis, & Oates,
2004). The next section reviews the reliability and validity of these questionnaires, followed
by the review of the a psychological measures used in stress research, including responseoriented measures and interaction-oriented stress measures, such as the well-established
State and Trait Anxiety Inventory by Spielberger et al. (1983), and the COPE by Carver,
Scheier, and Weintraub (1989). The section ends with a summary and a justification of the
measure chosen for addressing performance stress in this thesis.

2.2.1

Questionnaires used in music performance science

A questionnaire needs to be carefully examined in terms of its reliability, validity and factorial structure. In the musical domain, most questionnaires are adaptions of already established stress inventories (Osborne & Kenny, 2005).10
An example of a commonly used questionnaire in performance science is the Music Performance Anxiety Questionnaire (Cox & Kenardy, 1993). This questionnaire consists of 20 items
and assesses somatic and cognitive symptoms experienced prior to a musical performance.
Developed by Cox and Kenardy (1993), they asked thirty-two musicians to complete the Music Performance Anxiety Questionnaire, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, trait form (Spielberger et al., 1983) and the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (Turner, Beidel, Dancu, &
Stanley, 1989) during a practice setting, a solo setting and a group setting. A subsequently
10 The

Music Performance Anxiety Questionnaire (Cox & Kenardy, 1993), for instance, is based on the
Cognitive-Somatic Anxiety Questionnaire (Schwartz, Davidson, & Goleman, 1978), while the Performance
Anxiety Inventory (Nagel, 1990) is a modified version of the Test Anxiety Inventory based on Spielberger
(1980).

2.2. Psychological measures

carried out correlation analysis showed a non-significant relationship between these inventories during practice (r=.13; n.s.), while a significant association was obtained between both
the solo setting (r=.59, p<.001) and the group setting (r=.35, p<.05).
Another questionnaire that has been frequently administered to assess performance stress in
musicians is the Performance Anxiety Inventory by Nagel (1990). This measure is based on the
Test Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, 1980), consists of 20 items and assesses cognitive, behavioural and physiological symptoms experienced prior to a musical performance. Results
could demonstrate that the questionnaire exhibit an internal consistency of .89; however, the
outcome was only based on a sample of 22 students, and no other psychometric properties
were considered.
Initially developed in sport psychology, the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-Revised
(Martens et al., 1990) evaluates the psychological and physiological demands of competition
in athletes (i.e., assesses how athletes perceive performing under pressure). The measure
was adapted from the well-established State and Trait Anxiety Inventory by Spielberger et
al. (1970), and was developed with the intention to assess the multidimensionality aspects of
performance pressure, including cognitive and somatic anxiety, as well as of the confidence
to perform.11
To this end, Martens et al. (1990) generated a 27-item measurement, which reflects somatic
and cognitive symptoms of performance stress, as well as self-confidence on a 4-point Likert
Scale (1=‘Not at all’ to 4= ‘Very much so’). Each sub scale contains nine items and involves
statements such as ‘I am concerned about choking under pressure,’ ‘I feel nervous’ or ‘I feel
tense in my stomach,’ while item samples for evaluating self-confidence were represented
by comments including ‘I feel at ease’ or ‘I am confident I can meet the challenge.’
In the musical domain, the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-Revised has thus far only
applied in a handful of studies. For instance, Yoshie, Shigemasu, Kudo, and Ohtsuki (2009)
11 The

authors characterised performance stress as ‘. . . the process that involves the perception of a substantial imbalance between environmental demand and response capabilities under conditions in which a failure
to meet demands is perceives as having important consequences and is respond to with increased levels of
cognitive and somatic state anxiety’ (Martens et al., 1990, p. 10).

62

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations

used the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-Revised to test whether self-confidence is
positively correlated with performance quality, and whether the direction of the cognitive
and somatic sub scale positively predicts performance quality. For this, they asked 51 pianists to fill in the State Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger et al., 1983) and the Competitive State
Anxiety Inventory-Revised 30 minutes prior to a performance, and let musicians rate their
performance quality in terms of articulation, tempo, rhythm, technique, dynamic, phrasing, expressiveness, tone quality, tone accuracy, and organisation. The performance quality
rating was based on a 10-point Likert Scale (-5=‘Much worse’ to +5=‘Much better’), with
the midpoint ‘0’ suggesting that the performance during the test setting was as good as
their perceived best performance. The authors also administered the The Music Performance Anxiety Questionnaire as a post-performance questionnaire, in where they asked
the musicians how they felt during the performance (i.e., retrospective analysis). The results showed a significant positive correlation between the sub scale of the Competitive
State Anxiety Inventory-Revised and the State Anxiety Inventory and a significant negative correlation between the State Anxiety Inventory and self-confidence. Self-confidence
was furthermore strongly positively correlated with performance quality, suggesting that
musicians’ level of confidence shapes the success of a musicians’ career (McPherson & McCormick, 2006). In terms of the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-Revised and its internal consistency, the sub scale of somatic anxiety intensity exhibited a Cronbach’s α of .85,
and the sub scale somatic anxiety direction displayed a consistency of .86. For cognitive
anxiety intensity, cognitive anxiety direction and self-confidence, the internal consistency
was .83, .78, and .89, respectively. In terms of the construct validity, the correlation analysis
between the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-Revised and the the Music Performance
Anxiety Questionnaire showed a significant positive correlation with the sub scale of cognitive and somatic anxiety intensity, and a significant negative correlation between the Music
Performance Anxiety Questionnaire and the sub scale self-confidence. Based on this outcome, the authors conclude that ‘. . . sport and music performance share some similarities in
the anxiety-performance relationship, showing that musicians can benefit, at least partially,
from a vast amount of knowledge of anxiety coping strategies accumulated and polished in

2.2. Psychological measures

63

sport psychology research’ (Yoshie, Shigemasu, et al., 2009, p. 74).
A more recently validated musical performance anxiety questionnaire stems from Kenny et
al. (2004), namely the Music Performance Anxiety Inventory and the Music Performance Anxiety Inventory for Adolescents. Both are based on Barlow’s (2000) emotion based theory (for
more details, Chapter 1) and consider cognitive, behavioural and physiological symptoms,
aspects of general and specific psychological vulnerabilities (e.g., parental empathy), as well
as anxious propositions (e.g., negative affect, uncontrollability: for more details, see Chapter 2). To evaluate its psychometric properties, they asked thirty-two choir singers to fill
out the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger et al., 1983), a modified version of
the Music Performance Anxiety Questionnaire (Cox & Kenardy, 1993) and the Music Performance Anxiety Inventory (Kenny et al., 2004). The results demonstrated a Cronbach’s α
of .94 and an item-total correlation between .34-.89. A subsequent comparison with other
inventories showed that the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Music Performance
Anxiety Questionnaire (Cox & Kenardy, 1993) accounted for almost 86% of the Music Performance Anxiety Inventory’s variance. Overall, Kenny detected three main factors based
on her inventory: the first factor accounted for 43% and was labeled as somatic and cognitive
features while the second factor—identified as performance context—was explained by 6% of
the variance. The third factor, performance evaluation, explained 3%.
To conclude, the questionnaires above have experienced great use in the music domain and
can be found in numerous studies addressing performance stress or performance anxiety
(for more details, see Chapter 2). However, apart from the K-MPAI, which specifically assesses the state and trait characteristics of performance stress, they do not show sufficient
psychometric properties to allow scientifically strong applications. For these reasons, I have
decided to employ the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory developed by Spielberger et al.
(1983), a widely used questionnaire that has been used in both clinical and non-clinical research studies across a variety of different domains, including military, medicine and psychology. The next section is dedicated to the evaluation of the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, including its development, psychometric properties and current limitations, before
providing a justification as to why I used this inventory in my thesis studies.

2.2.2

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations

Questionnaires used in stress research

Based on decades of stress related research, there are several established questionnaires that
fulfil the necessary psychometric properties mentioned above. Again, the main aim of questionnaires in stress research is to capture emotional states induced by specific stimuli or
circumstances (i.e., response-oriented measures). These emotional states are understood as
individual processes and depended on one’s appraisal and coping abilities (i.e., interactionoriented stress measures). As mentioned in Chapter 1, the response-oriented theories define
the response to the environment as the main drive of experiencing stress while the interactional theories emphasis the person (appraisal, coping) as a mediator between the stimulus
(and the stimulus characteristics of the environment) and the patterns of response they trigger.
Many questionnaires have been developed in consideration of these aspects and aim to combine introspective reports on psychological, physiological and behavioural signs. The following section offers an overview of the most commonly administered questionnaires in
stress-related research, before scrutinising the feasibility of the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory by Spielberger et al. (1983) to assess (music) performance stress.

Response-oriented measures

Depression Anxiety Stress Scale The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale consists of 42 items
that aims to assess negative emotional states of depression, anxiety, and stress. The development of this questionnaire has arisen from the lack of defining and understanding the
emotional states represented by each of the above stated constructs. Each scale encompasses
14 items that are answered on a 4-point Likert Scale (0 = ‘Did not apply to me at all’ to 3 =
‘Applied to me very much, or most of the time’) and are referred to emotional symptoms experiences over the past week (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995). The summative score indicates
the severity and frequency of the emotional states. A short version, the Depression Anxiety
Stress Scale-21, is also available, including 7 items per scale. Each scale assesses different

2.2. Psychological measures

65

emotional contents, such as the ability to become interested, lack of motivation (Depression), the degree of worry, apprehension (Anxiety), experience of physiological symptoms
(e.g., dry mouth, dizziness), or the ability to relax as well as tolerance towards interruptions (Stress). The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale can be administrated individually or in
groups, in non-clinical, but also clinical assessments, and offers a dimensional rather than
categorical classification with regards to the severity of each construct. Application can be
found in paper-pencil form. Psychometric properties are provided for non-clinical samples
by Lovibond and Lovibond (1995), assessing the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and Beck
Anxiety Inventory as well as Beck Depression Inventory (Beck & Steer, 1993; Beck, A., &
Garbin, 1988) in 717 undergraduate psychology students. Internal consistency (coefficient
alpha) for each scale was 0.91 (Depression), 0.84 (Anxiety) and 0.90 (Stress). Data treatment
included a principal component and confirmatory factor analyses. Former led to three factors, accountable for 41.3% or the item variance. Items received mediocre to high loadings
within each factors, but were low for the others. The oblique rotation exhibited three correlated factors Depression-Anxiety r= 0.42; Anxiety-Stress r= 0.46; and Depression-Stress
r= 0.39. The CFA (one factor model) yielded an adjusted GFI of .60, with an increase of
0.14 when a two factor-model was applied (Anxiety versus Depression). A further threefactor model, considering Anxiety, Stress and Depression, resulted in phi coefficients of 0.61
(Depression-Anxiety), 0.76 (Anxiety-Stress), and 0.62 (Depression-Stress) and a GFI of .76.
This was also backed up by a three-factor exploratory factor analysis, using maximum likelihood as reference point. Results showed the lowest value for the three-factor solution
(X2 (738) =3025, p>.05). A further second-order factor analysis, including a common factor to
allow to influence all three scales, but not each other, replicated an identical fit and item
loadings (X2 (816) = 3559, p>.05; adjusted goodness of fit=0.76), exhibiting gamma coefficients
of 0.71 (Depression), 0.86 (Anxiety), and 0.88 (Stress). Overall, the growing body of studies
in stress research show that the DASS-21 exhibits greater discriminant validity than other
commonly used measures, including the Beck Depression Inventory and the Beck Anxiety
Inventory, suggesting that this inventory is able to successfully discriminate between stress,
anxiety and depression (Page, Hooke, & Morrison, 2007).

66

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations

Symptom Checklist-90-Revised The Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (Derogatis, 1983) is a
questionnaire that includes 90 items, ranging from 6-13 items per sub scale. Sub scales are
referred to somatization (12 items), obsessive-compulsive (10 items), depression (13 items),
anxiety (10 items), hostility (6 items), phobic anxiety (7 items), paranoid ideation (6 items),
psychoticism (10 items), interpersonal sensitivity (9 items), as well as 7 additional items
about perturbations in sleep or appetite patterns. All items are answered on a 5-point Likert
Scale (from 0=‘Not at all’ to 4=‘Extremely’) and ask about symptoms experienced over the
last seven days.

The analysis results in three global indices; the global severity index, the positive symptom
distress index, and the positive symptom total. The global severity index is drawn from the
average mean of all 90 items, the positive symptom distress index refer to the average score
above zero and the positive symptom total which shows the amount of items scored above
zero (Derogatis, 1983). While the global severity index indicated the level of ‘disorder,’ the
positive symptom distress index indicates the degree of intensity of item responses (e.g.,
augmenting versus attenuating symptoms). The inventory works self-administered and can
be done by paper and pencil, audiocassette or online. The time of administration takes
about 10-15 minutes and scores are reported in a or normalized T scores (Derogatis & Savitz,
2000). One of a recent study investigating psychometric properties stems from Prinz et al.
(2013), asking 2,727 clinical patients to fill in the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised and the
Beck Depression Inventory (Beck & Steer, 1993). Assessments included Cronbach’s α, the
pearson product-moment correlation, as well as a confirmatory factor analysis, evaluating
among others indexes such as the RMSEA and the CFI. Results showed sufficient internal
consistency between the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised and its sub scales, demonstrating
a Cronbach’s α of 0.87 for anxiety and .87 for Depression. In contrast, the factorial validity
was slightly below the required threshold, with 0.56 for the RSMEA (cut off <.06) and .74
for the CFI (cut off >.95). The pearson product-moment correlation between the Symptom
Checklist-90-Revised and Beck’s Depression inventory was significant with r=.80 for the
Symptom Checklist-90-Revised Anxiety sub scale and r=.61 for the Anxiety sub scale. These
results are in concordance with previously published studies (Schmitz et al., 2000), which

2.2. Psychological measures

67

recommend that the inventory—as well as the abbreviated form—is a sufficient instrument
to assess the state of physiological and psychological wellbeing.

Beck Anxiety Inventory The Beck Anxiety Inventory is a quick and easy Inventory focussing somatic symptoms in order to discriminate between anxiety and depression. The
21 symptoms assessed include items, such as the experience of nervousness, inability to relax, experienced over the last seven days and are rated on a 4-point Likert scale (0=‘Not at
all’ to 3=‘Severely’). It is a paper pencil questionnaire, takes approximately 5-10 minutes
and can be purchased from Pearson Assessment (Julian, 2011). The results are calculated by
summing the scores, with higher values indicating a greater severity of anxiety. In terms
of psychometric properties, the Beck Anxiety Inventory exhibits sufficient construct validity by showing a correlation of .47-.51 with the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger et al., 1983) and .81 with the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (Derogatis, 1983). The
internal consistency ranges from .90-0.94 and has been tested on a wide range of different
populations (Osman, Kopper, Varrios, Osman, & Wade, 1997) and is sensitive to change (Julian, 2011). Limitations of the Beck Anxiety Inventory can be found in the comparatively
restricted scope of symptoms assessed as well as its overlap with Depression Inventories.
Furthermore, the Beck Anxiety Inventory does not exclusively evaluate symptoms of anxiety, but also worry and rumination, making an adequate assessment of anxiety difficult.

State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety Inventory A relatively new inventory that evaluates the physiological responses to stress is the State-Trait Inventory for
Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA: Ree et al., 2008). The inventory encompasses 21
items rated on a 4-point Likert Scale (1=‘Not at all’ to 4=‘Very much so’) and with higher
scores indicating a greater degree of anxiety. Compared to the State and Trait Inventory, the
STICSA does not differentiate between ‘anxiety-present’ and ‘anxiety-absent’ items rather
than between cognitive and somatic symptoms exclusive to anxiety (for more details, see
Chapter 2). The STICSA was, contrarily to other anxiety measures, not developed from preexisting measures but from clinical (research) psychologists and graduate students experi-

enced in the field of performance stress research. Based on 113 initial items, 62 items were
selected to represent either somatic or cognitive state and trait anxiety symptoms. These
were then administered in 576 participants of different economic and cultural background,
leading to a final set of 10 cognitive and 11 somatic items. In terms of its psychometric
properties, for both scales a superior structure based on the correlated two-factor model
was detected. For the trait anxiety scale, results showed a GFI of .96, a CFI of .98, and a
RMSEA of .053. Total scores exhibited an unshared item variance of 56% for both cognitive
and somatic factors and an internal consistency of .87 for the cognitive factor and .84 for
the somatic factor. For the state anxiety scale, results showed a GFI of .97, a CFI of .99, and
a RMSEA of .051. Total scores showed an unshared item variance of 47% for both cognitive and somatic factors and internal consistency coefficient was .97. Grös, Simms, Antony,
and McCabe (2007) replicated Ree’s et al. study by asking 567 psychiatric patients to fill
out the STICSA, the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger et al., 1983), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-Depression as well as Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-Anxiety sub
scale (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995). A second sample, consisting of 311 psychology students
completed the STICSA only. Data treatment included: a one-factor model; two two-factor
models (cognitive or the somatic factor versus state or trait factor); and a four-factor model
(where state cognitive/somatic as well as trait cognitive/somatic factors were modelled directly). Model of fit indexes were based on the CFI and the RMSEA. The four-factor model
yielded an excellent fit across all features, supporting the state-trait and cognitive-somatic
differentiation (CFI=.92-.95; RMSEA=.04). For the psychiatric group, high internal consistency coefficients for cognitive and somatic sub scales (.88 and .87, for STICSA trait and
state measures, respectively) were detected. The inter-item correlations ranged between
r=.41 (somatic) and r=.46 (cognitive) for the STICSA-State scale and between r=.38 (somatic)
and r=.44 (cognitive) for the STICSA-Trait scale. A similar powerful outcome was found
in the non-clinical sample. In terms of the convergent and discriminant validity, the Trait
Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety was more correlated with the Trait Anxiety
Inventory (Spielberger et al., 1983), while the STICSA-State scale showed stronger correlation with the State Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger et al., 1983). In addition, the State-Trait

2.2. Psychological measures

69

Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety was stronger correlated with the Depression
Anxiety Stress Scale-Anxiety sub scale, while the Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger et al.,
1983) exhibited a stronger correlation with the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-Depression
sub scale (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995).

The State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, trait form and state form The State and Trait Anxiety Inventory by Spielberger et al. (1970) has been translated into over 48 languages and applied in a wide range of different domains, successfully assessing medical disorders, general
psychological processes such as attention, memory and learning, experimental and clinical
studies. It can be completed in less than 10 minutes and measures the participants’ predisposition to being anxious (trait anxiety), as well as the level of anxiety at a given point in
time (state anxiety). It contains 20 ‘anxiety present’ and ‘anxiety absent’ items (‘I feel upset’
versus ‘I am happy’), answered on a 4-point Likert Scale (1=‘Almost Never/Not at all’ to
4=‘Almost Always/Very much so’), and with higher scores reflecting higher levels of worry
and tension (Spielberger et al., 1983).
The main intention is to provide a relatively briefly conductible self-report scale of state
and trait anxiety. Both anxiety scales are aimed to go hand in hand; individuals showing
a higher score in trait anxiety should also exhibit a higher score in state anxiety. The State
and Trait Anxiety Inventory has been a sufficient instrument to measure anxiety (Barnes,
Harp, & Jung, 2002), and show moderate to excellent reliability (Cronbach’s α>0.86), re-test
reliability (α>0.65) and validity across various fields of research.12 A further reason for its
feasibility is its level of simplicity. It can be completed in less than 10 minutes and offers a
12 Barnes

et al. (2002) assessed the internal and ret-test consistency as well as validity of the State and Trait
Anxiety Inventory in over 816 studies published between the year 1990 and 2000. For this, Barnes et al. split
studies into two publication periods, namely between the year 1990-1994 and 1995-2000. The review consisted of specific criteria, namely studies that assessed its psychometric properties, studies that refereed to
other studies in order to justify its feasibility and studies that ignored the assessment of psychometric properties. Barnes et al. further differentiated studies in terms of medical versus non-medical studies, including
low- versus high-stress related research (context), the participants’ age, design of the study, as well as type of
reliability calculated (e.g., internal consistency versus retest-reliability). The findings show that non-medical
studies increased their report of reliability coefficients from 6%-10% and were—compared to medical studies—
more likely to calculate the psychometric properties from the collected set of data. Medical studies showed
a similar trend yet did altogether not provide descriptive statistics. In both cases—medical and non-medical
studies—the retest reliability coefficient was more often reported for the Trait Anxiety Inventory than for the
State Anxiety Inventory.

strong standardisation sample for comparison.
In terms of its factorial structure, the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory has been claimed to
be a multidimensional measure based on a two-correlated method factor model, one labelled
as anxiety present (non reversed coded items) and the other anxiety absent factor (reversecoded items: Lim & Kwon, 2007; Spielberger et al., 1983; Spielberger & Sydeman, 1994).
Recent studies, could show a more diverse picture, in particular when the State and Trait
Anxiety Inventory was administered alongside other anxiety and depression inventories.
Bieling, Antony, and Swinson (1998), for instance, compared the State and Trait Anxiety
Inventory-trait form with measures such as the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck et al.,
1988), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck & Steer, 1993) or the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale
(Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995). The results showed that based on a sample of 212 patients
suffering from various anxiety disorders, the factorial structure that was best presented was
the hierarchical model with two lower and one higher order factors—the first two labelled
as State and Trait Anxiety Inventory-Depression (STAI-D; 13 items) and State and Trait Anxiety Inventory-Anxiety (STAI-A; 7 items) and the higher factor as negative affect (GFI=.84,
AGFI=.80, RMSR=.06). The internal consistency was .88 for the factor depression and .78 for
the factor anxiety. A strong correlation was observed between the STAI-A, the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-Anxiety sub scale and the STAI-D
with the Beck Depression Inventory and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-Depression
sub scale, respectively.
Vigneau and Cormier (2008) investigated the factorial structure of both the State and Trait
Anxiety Inventory-trait form and the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory-trait form-state
form. Several confirmatory factor analyses were carried out based on three samples (n=500888/group), showing that the two-construct (state versus trait), two-method model (negative versus positive polarized items) revealed the best model-of-fit, accounting for 39%-47%
of the item variance—with small variations between each sample (GFI between .82-.85, a
CFI between .84-.88, and a RMSEA between .058-.059: Vigneau & Cormier, 2008).
Bados et al. (2010) evaluated the factorial structure of the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory-

trait form proposed by Spielberger et al. (1983), Bieling et al. (1998) and Vigneau and
Cormier (2008). In addition, they applied a bifactor model, facilitating an easier interpretation compared to general/second-order factor models, especially when comparing different
samples (Balsamo et al., 2013)13 . The model was defined by two specific factors (anxiety
and depression, supposedly), one general factor (negative affect, supposedly), while the
calculation of items loadings were based on a first order (i.e., all items contribute to the
total score: Bados et al., 2010). The results showed a superior model-of-fit for the bifactor
model (GFI=.89, CFI=.92, RMSEA=.73), which was then compared with other anxiety and
depression measures, such as the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, the
Symptom Checklist-90-Revised.

Balsamo et al. (2013) re-assessed all proposed factor models on a sample of 1,124 psychiatric outpatients and 877 healthy subjects and administered the State and Trait Anxiety
Inventory-trait form alongside other anxiety and depression measures, such as the BAI and
the BDI-II (i.e., a modification of the BDI). Results revealed that for both groups the oneconstruct, two-methods model as well as the bifactor model represented the best model-of13 A

bifactor model is a potential alternative to the second order models when ‘. . . (a) there is a general factor
that is hypothesised to account for the commonality of the items; (b) there are multiple domain specific factors,
each of which is hypothesised to account for the unique influence of the specific domain over and above the
general factor; and (c) the researcher may be interested in the domain specific factors as well as the common
factor that is of focal interest’ (Chen, West, & Sousa, 2006, p. 190).

of .06, respectively, for the clinical sample; GFI of .90; a CFI of .98, and a RMSEA of .08 and
a GFI of .90; a CFI of .98, and a RMSEA of .08, respectively, for the healthy sample). The
one-construct, two-methods model as well as the bifactor model also exhibited the best reliability; the one-construct, two-methods model demonstrated an internal consistency of .88
and .89 (positive polarity), as well as .89 and .88 (negative polarity) for the clinical and for
non-clinical patients, respectively, while the bifactor model revealed an internal consistency
of .91 and .89 for depression and .86 and .87 for anxiety for the clinical sample and for the
non-clinical sample, respectively. The one-construct, two-methods model showed stronger
correlations between positive/negative polarity and the BDI-II (r=.63-.72; r=.62-.71) than between these two and the BAI (r=.59-.62; r=.40-.45), while results from the bifactor model
correlated higher with the BDI-II (r=.67-.75; r=.63-.66) than with the BAI (r=.46-.51; r=.59.64).

Interaction-oriented stress measures

Interaction-oriented stress measures aim to assess the link between performance stress and
coping as coping is a strong mediator between the perception and the actual quality of
the musicians’ performance (Kenny, 2011). Most musicians apply emotion focused coping strategies rather than problem-focused coping strategies (Wolfe, 1990). Emotion focused coping strategies involve emotional regulation to distract from the stressor, while the
problem-focused coping strategies are characterised by active problem solving in order to
reduce or diminish the source of stress (for more details, see Chapter 1).
Related studies investigating the impact of stress and coping is the study by Fehm and
Schmidt (2006). They asked 74 high school students to not only provide information on
detrimental performance stress (expressed through increased performance anxiety), but also
to pinpoint short- and long-term coping strategies, situational influences on their performance stress as well as about their level of wish to seek for external help. Results showed
that somatic symptoms of performance anxiety occurred most frequently by sweaty palms,

2.2. Psychological measures

73

whereas cognitive symptoms were expressed by enhanced apprehension about possible
mistakes as well as being overcritical of the performance (this was detected by the Music
Performance Anxiety Questionnaire: Cox & Kenardy, 1993). Those who aimed for a musical
career showed fewer complaints about performance stress than those who didn’t have such
plans. Situational influences affecting the level of music performance anxiety was dependent on the setting and the status of the audience, with solo performance invoking most fear,
followed by orchestra, chamber music and private music lessons. In terms of the audience,
students report teachers and professors to be most fearful, mainly with regards to their level
of professional knowledge and due to the importance of their judgement. Students’ first performance, their frequency of solo performances and their frequency of performance during
the last six months was not related to their level of music performance anxiety, a result that
was also detected by Rae (2004). Short term coping strategies were mainly reported by behavioural actions, such as food intake, rehearsing of difficult parts or washing hands by half
of the sample. Cognitive coping strategies, such as positive thinking were used by 81.2% of
the sample, however, despite its usefulness, only applied on rare occasions. Other strategies
involved relaxation techniques (18.4%), yet with only 6.8% applying these frequently to always. Long-term strategies were defined by seeking help, relaxation techniques, talking to
friends or teachers, however with the last two being used rarely or never. In contrast, practice strategies were reported as the main coping mechanism beneficial towards detrimental
performance stress by almost 41%. Suggestions to increase the level of coping ability, students suggested implementing interventions during instrumental lessons, such as by a more
supporting atmosphere, the possibility to talk or discuss the issue of performance stress as
well as by the providing of more performance opportunities. In addition, courses and intervention outside of the class-room was requested, including relaxation training and specific
performance training.

Wesner et al. (1990), for instance, examined aspects of performance related problems, such
as distress due to performance anxiety, impairment caused by this performance stress and
treatment musicians were seeking to cope with it. The results revealed a significant effect of
performance anxiety on perceived distress, concentration and musicians’ tendency to avoid

74

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations

performing. Drug abuse was unlikely in both men and women and not perceived as performance quality enhancing; contrary, however, prescribed drugs, such as beta blocker were
seen as performance improving. Performance stress and the inability to cope with it is characterised by an increase in somatic symptoms such as dry mouth, trembling, elevated heart
rate and shortness of breath.

COPE A questionnaire that has been used in performance science and that gives a strong
foundation to evaluate the ability to cope with stress in a flexible manner is the COPE developed by Carver et al. (1989). The COPE is a 53-item 4-point Likert scale (1=‘I haven’t
been doing this at all’ to 4=‘I have been doing this a lot’) questionnaire and assesses 14
components: Active Coping; Planning; Suppression of Competing Activities; Restraint Coping; Seeking Social Support; Emotional, Positive Reinterpretation and Growth; Acceptance;
Turning to Religion; Focus on and Venting of Emotions; Denial; Behavioral Disengagement;
Mental Disengagement; and Alcohol/Drug Disengagement.
Active coping is the attempt to remove the source of the stressor by the initiative of the individual (i.e., problem-focused). Planning is the consideration of how to successfully cope
with the problem, evaluating efficient strategies, yet without taking a direct action. Planning
is similar to problem-focused coping (for more details, see Chapter 1), albeit execution appears during the secondary appraisal, rather than as part of an active coping. Suppression
of competing activities involves the attempt to not get distracted and to put other interfering
thoughts or activities aside in order to be able to focus on the main problem (i.e., problemfocused). Restraint coping keeps the individual waiting until an appropriate time to act
on the problem efficiently (i.e., problem-focused). Seeking social support for instrumental
also falls under the classification of problem-focused solving and implied the active engagement with third parties to seek help and advice. A similar variable, the seeking support for
emotional reasons, is emotion-focused and emphasis moral support, understanding, and
sympathy. Such emotional support seeking may either lead into another problem-focused
solving approach or to the mainly dysfunctional approach of, e.g., focusing and venting
of emotions, which is the tendency to concentrate on the distressing event and to ventilate

2.2. Psychological measures

75

those feelings. Other maladaptive problem solving strategies are the behavioural disengagement. The behavioural disengagement reduces the endeavour to actually tackle the
problem, and is identified with other concepts, such as helplessness, or self-handicapping,
leading to poor coping outcomes. Mental disengagement is a side effect of the behavioural
disengagement and reinforces the avoidance to deal with the problem by applying mental
distractions, such as daydreaming, escaping through sleep or watching TV. Positive reinterpretation and growth, also classified as positive reappraisal (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984)
includes emotion-focused problem solving and emphasis the reduction of distress (e.g., anxiety) rather than to deal with the source of the problem. Denial occurs during the primary
appraisal and has been seen as either useful to minimise the stress and to actively engage
with the problem or to generate additional problems by ignoring the stressor and, thus,
increasing the risk of becoming severe. Acceptance implies two concepts; acceptance of a
stressor may occur during the primary appraisal or during the secondary appraisal, which
comes alongside the absence of a current coping strategy. Turning to religion is an emotional problem and problem coping strategy that may either add emotional support during
the appraisal process or assist as a tactic to actively cope with the stressor. Alcohol/Drug
Disengagement involves substance misuse and aids further distraction from the source of
the problem.
The COPE was developed with the intention to incorporate the diversity of coping and to
overcome the often vague and ambiguous items used in other coping measures, based on
empirical assumptions rather than on the consideration of the theoretical aspect of coping.
As such, it is an ideal tool to be used for further assessment of performance stress in the music domain. The inventory was first evaluated by Carver et al. (1989), who administered the
final set of items—after several re-evaluations—to 978 students and evaluated its factorial
structure. The results showed 11 factors that had a greater Eigenvalue than 1 and with each
scale showing an internal consistency of above .60.
The COPE was also compared with other measures, such as the Self-esteem Scale (Greenberg
et al., 1992) and the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger et al., 1983). Strong significant positive correlations were found between the the Self-esteem Scale and the sub scales

76

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations

active coping, planning, and positive reinterpretation and growth, as well as significant negative correlations for the sub scales focus and ventilations on emotions and behavioural
disengagement. For the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, significant negative correlations
were observed for the scales active coping, positive reinterpretation, and significant positive correlations between focus and ventilation of emotions, denial, and behavioural and
mental disengagement. A psychometric re-assessment of the COPE stems from Lyne and
Roger (Lyne & Roger, 2000), administering the questionnaire to 1395 (return and complete
response rate: 539), with almost 90% of the sample being female. The COPE was also given
alongside scales, such as the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Eysenck & Eysenck, 1964),
the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) or the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). Data treatment included an exploratory
factor analysis, and final results showed a three-factor solution, labelled as Rational or Active Coping, expressing feelings and seeking emotional support, Avoidance Coping or Helplessness. Litman (2006) examined the factorial structure of the COPE by asking 230 students
to fill in the COPE, the International Personality Item Pool Extraversion Scale (Goldberg,
1999), and the Trait scales of the State Trait Personality Inventory (Spielberger, 1979). A
factor analysis (oblique rotation) resulted in a four-factor solution, accounting for approximately 80% of the variance. Factor 1 was labeled as problem-focused coping strategies
(61%), factor II as avoidance coping behaviour (46%), factor III was determined as socially
supported coping (62%) and factor IV (38%) was characterised as emotion-focused strategies. Correlations with other measures revealed low (and negative) correlations between
trait anxiety and problem-focused coping strategies, as well as social support, and highest
relationships with avoidance coping strategies, such as behavioural and mental disengagement. The trait Extraversion showed higher correlations with strategies, such as planning
and active coping, as well as instrumental social support, and lower correlations with behavioural disengagement, denial, as well as emotional restraint. In a follow up study, they
asked 357 students to complete the COPE, the Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, 1979)
and the Values and Action Inventory of Strengths (Peterson & Seligman, 2004). This time
an exploratory factor analysis suggested a three-factor solution, accounting for 70% of the

2.2. Psychological measures

77

variance. All three factors exhibited similar item and scale loadings than in the first study;
with the first and the third showing greater correlation (r=.58) than the second with the
first (r=.18) and the third (r=.16), demonstrating that self-sufficient and socially supported
strategies revealed stronger association to one another than the avoidant coping strategy. A
comparison with the other measures showed a similar trend for the anxiety measure; significant negative relationships were detected between anxiety and planning, active coping
and positive reinterpretation and growth, and strongest positive correlations with avoidant
coping strategies, such as behavioural disengagement and denial. The Values and Action
Inventory of Strengths, measuring positive traits was significantly positive correlated with
each sub scale of self-sufficient strategies (e.g., planning, active coping) and, as expected,
significantly negative correlated with avoidant coping behaviour, such as behavioural disengagement.
Overall, the COPE seems adequate for identifying the coping strategies applied in musicians
during the experience of performance stress, and adds some valuable information with regards to the interaction-oriented stress theories (for more details, see Chapter 1).

Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II Another questionnaire that has been used in stress
research and which has also found some application in performance science is the HealthPromoting Lifestyle Profile II by Walker, Sechrist, and Pender (1987). The Inventory is an
indirect measure of coping abilities and measures health-promoting behaviour based on
self-initiated actions and perceptions and evaluates features such as spiritual growth, interpersonal relations, nutrition or physical activity. It has been developed by Walker et al.
(1987), administering a 100-items dichotomous (yes/no) scale from a checklist used in clinical nursing school. Results based in an factor analysis showed that the scale contains six
dimensions, explaining 47.1% of the total variance. The overall internal consistency of the
inventory was .94, and the sub scale consistency ranged between .79-87., while the criterion
validity (measured against a perceived health status and quality of life) was between .26-.49,
respectively. The test-retest comparison demonstrated a stable Cronbach’s α of .89. Other
studies that tested the inventories in terms of its factorial structure stems from Pinar, Ce-

78

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations

lik, and Bahcecik (2009). Based on a sample of 920 students, internal consistency, item-total
correlation and test-retest stability (2 weeks apart) was calculated. Goodness-of-fit indexes
were: the CFA; the CFI; the (adjusted) GFI; and the RMSEA. In addition, cross-scale correlations were obtained for each sub scale. Results show an internal consistency coefficient of .92
for the whole inventory, while values for the sub scales (N, PA, HR, SM, IR, and SG) ranged
between .73-.83, respectively. Item-total correlation was exhibited above the required .20
threshold; the test-retest reliability coefficient for the whole inventory was .95 and for each
sub scale between .73 and .87, respectively. In terms of the construct validity, a first factor
analysis revealed a 5-factor solution, explaining 41% of the variance. Two items were deleted
due to low factor loadings, leading to an item-correlation above .30 for all items. A subsequent calculation of the Cronbach’s α yielded values ranging between .64 and .93 for each
factor, while item-total correlations ranged between .20-.69. The first factor included items
based on the sub scale SG, IR, and DM; the second factor contained items from the sub scales
health responsibility, nutrition, and interpersonal relationship; the third factor represented
items from the sub scale PA; the fourth factor contained items of the sub scale SM; and the
fifth factor was related to items from the sub scale N. Pinar et al. (2009) furthermore compared their five factor solution against the six factor model proposed by Walker et al. (1987).
The subsequently carried out confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated moderate modelof-fit indexes (CFI=.89; GFI=.87; AGFI=.71; RMSEA=.22), while the deletion of 4 items led to
a significant improvement (CFI=.96; GFI=.95, AGFI=.88, RMSEA=.04). Cronbach’s α for the
whole inventory was .91 and ranged between .70 and .83 between sub scales. Furthermore,
low correlations between the sub scale IR and PA (r=.20) was observed, while strongest associations were found between the sub scale spiritual growth and interpersonal relationship
(r=.88). Last, item-total correlation for the entire inventory ranged between .20 and .65. Another study investigating the psychometric properties of the HPLP II stems from Meihan and
Chung-Ngok (2011). Their evaluation included the calculation of its internal consistency and
item-total correlation of each sub scale. Their confirmatory factor analysis assessed the initially proposed 6-factor structure, albeit let to the deletion of one item, increasing the Cronbach’s α from .71 to .73. The remaining 51 were revalidated, producing an AGFI of .95 and

2.2. Psychological measures

79

a RMSEA of .001, while correlations between the HPLP II and sub scales ranged between
.74 and .87. The internal consistency of the total score was .91 and the sub scales ranged
between .81 (SM) and .86 (SM). The authors, furthermore, compared the inventory against
the World Health abbreviated Organization’s Quality of life assessment (WHOQOL-BREF;
Yao, Chung, Yu, and Wang (2002), participants’ perceived health status and demographic
background. Results showed that the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II correlated significantly (p<.05) with the WHOQOL-BREF and the self-reports given—shown by a positive
relation between the financial status of participants and their educational degree. PerezFortis, Ulla Diez, and Padilla (2012) administered the inventory in a sample of 1.219 college
students, assessed its factor structure (varimax rotation) and compared several them with
several confirmatory factor analysis. Goodness-of-fit indexes included the GFI, the adjusted
goodness of fit index (AGFI), the comparative fit index (CFI), and the root mean square error
of approximation (RMSEA). Due to a too low item-correlation (<.20) two items (N14 and 50)
were excluded. The exploratory factor analysis of 50 items led to six factors that accounted
for 40% of the variance. After the removal of six further items due to low cross loading difference (<.10), 44 items remained for further analysis. The first factor (PA) was represented
by items from the PA, the second factor (SG) by items from the SG and IR; the third factor
(IR) by items from spiritual growth as well as health responsibility, while the fourth factor (HR) included items of the HR and the SM. Finally, the fifth factor (SM) included items
from both sub scales N and SG. Another CFA compared the new 44-item structure with the
previous 52-item inventory. While the initial 52 items revealed a RSMEA, CFI, GCI, and an
AGFI of .05, .94, .75, and .73, respectively, the 44-item inventory revealed a RSMEA CFI GCI
and an AGFI of .04, .96, .83, and .81. This superior outcome was also reinforced by the increased internal consistency of .87 for the total inventory, and .51 (stress management) and
.82 (physical activity) between sub scales.

In performance science, the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II was for instance applied by
Ginsborg, Kreutz, Thomas, and Williamon (2009), who assessed musicians’ degree of health
promoting behaviour, level of self-efficacy, and musculoskeletal health problems and compared them to students of nursing and biomedical science. The results demonstrated that

80

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations

music students are significantly less conscious about their health compared to their counterpart, experiencing lower self-efficacy and higher musculoskeletal health problems. Kreutz,
Ginsborg, and Willamon (2008), using the same inventory, demonstrated furthermore a general engagement toward health promoting behaviour, such as nutrition, interpersonal relations, and spiritual growth, albeit such engagement did not include effective physical activity or stress management. As such, the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II may be an ideal
tool to address musicians’ health promoting behaviour in a rigorous manner.

Summary and approach used in this thesis Questionnaires allow a quick assessment of
large samples with relatively little effort. To gather meaningful information, they must, however, fulfil certain psychometric properties, such as a decent validity and reliability (Hale &
Astolfi, 2011). A valid questionnaire measures for what it has been designed for (Field, 2008).
This sounds rather simple, yet contains many theoretical and practical challenges. A wellvalidated questionnaire provides a comprehensive and well-thought-through rationale as
to why items (or factors) have been chosen; yet, theoretical construct may be complex, contain many features and challenge the identification of an appropriate set of items. A reliable
questionnaire demonstrates a sufficient test-retest reliability or internal consistency. High
test-retest reliability occurs when the questionnaire produces similar outcomes after having
been applied several times, while the internal consistency assesses the degree of regularity
between items, but also subjects (split half-reliability versus inter-rater reliability).
For my thesis, I decided to administer the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, trait and state
form, developed by Spielberger et al. (1983). Translated into 48 languages, the State and
Trait Anxiety Inventory is completed in less than 10 minutes and measures the participants’
predisposition to being anxious (trait anxiety), as well as the level of anxiety at a given point
in time (state anxiety). It has been widely tested and is considered as ‘established’ measure
to identify musicians’ psychological state. The inventory has, based on a meta-review carried out by Barnes et al. (2002) moderate to excellent reliability (Cronbach’s α>.86), re-test
reliability (>.65) and validity across various research fields, such as medicine, psychology
and sport.

Interviews

Interviews collect contextual and temporal perspectives on a specific topic, with researchers
being actively engaged with the situation and the participants (Morgan, 1997; Onwuegbuzie,
Leech, & Collins, 2010; Rabiee, 2004). The type of interview used and addressed in this
thesis is the focus group interview. The focus group interview is carried out if relatively
little knowledge about the topic exists. Ideally, it should take place in a comfortable and
‘non-threatening’ environment and be supported by a moderator, who has an in-depth understanding of the content, a high degree of personal engagement and the skill to balance
the group dynamic (Courage & Baxter, 2005).14 Alongside a moderator assists note-takers,
videographers, or observers. Note-takers keep track on details, draw lines between comments and refer them back to previous observations. They also prevent the group from
repetitions of similar content. Videographers record the interview and observers evaluate
potential discrepancies between what has been said or avoided due to e.g., social desirability
(Wimmer & Dominick, 1997).
A successful focus group interview is foremost defined by a detailed activity timeline. An
activity timeline contains a report of each action, such as introduction, discussion, wrap
up procedure and the calculation of its approximate duration. During the introduction,
participants are welcomed, asked to take their seats and to eventually fill out paperwork.
Subsequently, an explanation of the purpose of the interview and its main ground rules are
provided (e.g., confidentiality and free expression and tolerance of opinions). The interview
then starts with a broad ‘opening-question’ in order to get a first impression of the group dynamic and to obtain a rough idea of how the interview might evolve. The interview should
appear as loosely structured as possible, allowing conversations of unexpected outcome and
interactions between participants rather than between the participant and the moderator.
The structure of a focus group interview is determined by the questions asked; these can be

such, the moderator secures space for a fruitful discussion, facilitates activity and tolerates and keeps
track of comments that might be contradictory to common group opinions. Simultaneously, a successful moderator keeps track on the lists of questions—all of which should preferably be answered within the session
held.

structured, semi-structured, or open-ended. Structured interviews (e.g., Yes/No answers)
ensure a complete data set, yet also reduce the richness of the data. Open-end interviews
(e.g., ‘How do you experience. . . ?’) enable greater expression of individual opinions on a
certain topic; yet they require a time-consuming analysis/interpretation (Wimmer & Dominick, 1997). An alternative to both is semi-structured focus group interview; they allow
a greater expression of opinions, while being able to collect the required information. The
focus group interview is then transcribed by either members of the research team or external
companies for an agreed fee.
The focus group interview is analysed based on a data reduction process and in order to
identify overarching themes (Courage & Baxter, 2005). For instance, the more words or
phrases are repeated the stronger is the justification to use them as themes. The same accounts for familiar/unfamiliar words (these may encompass the use of ‘local’ language,
adding further meaning to the context), metaphors, analogies and transitions, discovered
by pausing, a changed tone of words or interruptions. Similarities and linguistic connectors
serve as another indicator by making comparisons across data units, or by looking at single words, such as ‘because’ (i.e., causal relations), ‘if. . . then’ (conditional relations), ‘is a’
(i.e., taxonomic categories), ‘before’, ‘after’ (i.e., time-oriented relation). Themes can also be
represented by missing data and are defined by what has not been said or avoided. Theoryrelated material focuses on themes that illuminate questions of theoretical importance.
Themes can be subtle, symbolic or a product of cultural agreement and should be attached
with core and peripheral elements that are ordered towards a hierarchical structure and
supported by with quotes of the actual data. This is done by methods such as cutting and
sorting, word lists and key words in context (KWIC), word occurrence, or meta coding.
Cutting and sorting—also called ‘Cut and Paste’-method—facilitates the identification of
emerging phrases, sentences or exchanges between participants by using a coloured system
approach. Categories created either maximise differences or emphasise similarities (Bernard
& Ryan, 2010; Robson, 2011). The KWIC is based on simple frequency word counts and
helps researchers to get a first idea of relevant themes. Word counts can be illustrated in
‘respondent-by-word matrices, scree plots (by having the number of participants on the y-

2.2. Psychological measures

83

axis and the ‘unique’ words on the x-axis) or similarity matrices. Word-occurrence refers to
words that appear most likely linked with related ones. The word ‘crime’, for instance, is often combined with the word ‘violence’, while the word ‘performance’ usually comes alongside ‘nervousness’ or ‘stage fright’. Meta coding examines themes embedded in overarching
themes and requires extensive time commitment and experience in qualitative research. To
assure reliability, more than one member of the research team should carry it out.
The analysis of focus group interview can also be carried out using computer assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS). The most common software packages are Verbastat
(by SPSS), Ethnograph (by QSR international) or NVivo (by QSR international). Each differs
in terms of costs, focus and simplicity; the software package Verbastat or Ethnograph, for
instance, is a simple descriptive tool, while NVivo links codes to their potential hierarchies,
generating a more advanced theory-building approach (Table 2.6: Duriau & Reger, 2004;
Zikmund & Babin, 2010).

Once the data has been organised and interpreted in relation to the theoretical constructed
tested, results have to be written up for potential publications, reports or dissertations (Taylor & Bogdan, 1998). This involves the consideration of several steps: firstly, it is inevitable
to inform the reader about methods and analyses used (e.g., structured questions, focus
group interview, etc.) in order to allow replication. This also encompasses the number of
participants, the setting, and the time and length spent on the data collection. Secondly, it

84

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations

needs to be defined whether the data collection was purely descriptively driven or considered to fill the gaps within a theoretical concept. Consequently, changes in assumptions and
perceptions throughout the process of analysis should be provided. Thirdly, data should be
reported in a concise and direct way, including quotes, an interpretation, and a conclusion.
The overuse of similar quotes should be avoided to reduce the impression of poor data.
Quotes should not be changed unless the context does not allow otherwise (should this be
the case, parentheses including commas should be incorporated). They should be short and
crisp in order to: (1) not lose the reader’s attention; and (2) keep a clear line of thoughts.
Comments from note takers or observer should not be implemented. Lastly, qualitative data
should not be reported in a quantitative way, using words, such as findings, informants, or
people instead of including results or participants. Findings should be presented in the first
person perspective—they are your findings and your conclusions (Breakwell, 2006). In summary, quotes should be kept as natural as possible and not be overstated. Despite the aim
of verifying or falsifying an a priori made assumption, they are not the ground truth. Data
represent a perspective of a particular group at a particular time and might not necessarily
be applicable to a broader population.
Overall, interviews are conducted to get an in-depth understanding of a population within
a certain context and are conducted by either one-to-one or group interviews. Depending on
the setting and research objectives, questions may be structured, semi-structured or openended. While structured questionnaires determine the choice of answers, semi-structured
allows more space for subjective expressions. Open-ended questions offer most meaningful
by means of limitless expression. On the downside, such possibility is time consuming, and
requires a complex data analysis. This can be partially overcome by qualitative computer
software tools, ranging in simplicity and costs, starting from basic word counts to more
advanced coding systems. Preferably combined with human evaluation, the data output
should be considered in terms of:

• Words (e.g., specific meaning)
• Context (e.g., answer triggered by a question versus a comment)

2.2. Psychological measures

85

• Internal consistency (e.g., change of the interpretation of experience)
• Extensiveness and Frequency (e.g., how many participants said what how often, time
spend on a specific question)
• Intensity (e.g., emotionally delivered)
• Specificity (e.g., specific versus vague responses) in order to detect the
• Big themes (i.e., ideas).

As such, the researcher detects important parts within the text, develops a categorical system
of representative statements, quotes, phrases—all of which aim to facilitate a meaningful
interpretation of the data obtained. Conducting interviews, however, also encompass some
challenges; firstly, interviews have been criticised for many not foreseeable obstacles, such as
the degree of reactivity in participants, the pressure to go through the questioned prepared,
or the social norms and adaptions interviewed are exposed to. Secondly, the analysis of
qualitative data provides room for subjective interpretations, not necessarily reflecting to
true content of the data. To prevent such violation, several assessors are recommended in
order to increase the degree of reliability and validity.

Summary and approach used in this thesis Interviews are most suitable for samples ranging from one-to/one interviews to group interviews. Given the nature of the interview
setting and the research objectives, questions asked may be structured, semi-structured or
open-ended, consequently varying in their degree of complexity. While structured questionnaires require a simple—yes or no—answer, semi-structured allows more space for subjective expressions. Open-ended questions offer the most meaningful interrogation by allowing the interviewed to limitless expression. On the downside, such approach is timeconsuming and includes the increased risk of biased analysis. A tool that helps to analyse
such complex data is the application of software tools. Such facilitators allow a quick and
relatively unbiased data analysis and range from simple word frequency tools to more advanced coding system.

86

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations

Thus main aim of a FGI is to develop categories of representative statements, quotes and
phrases in order to facilitate a meaningful interpretation of the data. The selection of an
adequate technique depends on various factors, ranging from the characteristics of the data
collected, the skill set of the researcher, as well as the consideration of the amount of labour.
Data may include transcriptions, but also video and audio files, varying in time, length and
detail. Depending on these, different methodological approaches may be chosen.
The rationale for using a focused group interview to collect qualitative data was to gain a
variety of perspectives on the same topic. In this case, the experience and perception of using
simulation training. The focus group allows to obtain knowledge of participants’ shared
understanding of using simulation training, and, if led well by the moderator, provides
some meaningful data. It furthermore is well-suited for discussing new a research area and
to obtain some preliminary data where little understanding of the topic addressed exists. I
used focus group interviews to explore a thematic concept that is not easy to observe and
difficult to get access to. It also allows to collect a concentrated set of personal perspectives
in a very short amount of time. All these aspects speak for the feasibility of my choice of
using focus group interviews.
The data collected in this thesis was based on a semi-structured focus group interview and
conducted by the researcher with two observers making notes that were discussed afterwards. The material was transcribed and analysed using NVivo in order to detect the main
themes (see Chapter 6). The analysis was next carried out using a Thematic Analysis—a
bottom up process that generated meaningful themes from the data.
Thematic analysis helps you to identify, analyse and report themes within a data set. It is
based on the fact that the execution of thematic analysis is relatively loosely determined, it
is important to provide details of the process and details of analysis as much as possible
(Braun & Clarke, 2006). The researcher who conducts a thematic analysis should ideally
acknowledge her/his own theoretical position of the research, an outline of what the researcher wants to know. Thematic analysis seeks to describe themes across qualitative data
rather than within a data item, such as found in an individual interview (biographical or

2.2. Psychological measures

87

case-study), and is particularly suited for researcher in their early career in qualitative research.
Thematic analysis may involve a realistic method, which reports experiences, meanings and
the reality of participants, or it may involve a constructionist method, which assesses the
way how experiences, events or realities are shaped by a wide range of discourses within
the society. Thematic works therefore in both way to either reflect reality or to unravel the
surface of reality.
Themes of patterns within the data set can be found by means of an inductive ‘bottom up’
process or through a more theoretical or deductive ‘top down’ approach. The former is
characterised by a strong link with the data that have been collected (e.g., through focus
group interviews), and with themes having little connection to the specific questions that
participants were asked. Inductive data analysis is a process that is absent of the aim of
trying to fit into a pre-existing framework, or the researcher’s preconceptions.15 In contrast,
a ‘theoretical’ thematic analysis is driven and characterised by a theoretical or analytical
framework that is of interest for the researcher. This approach is therefore analyst-driven;
the description of the data is less rich than for the inductive thematic analysis, yet more
detailed in terms of the analysis of the data (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The choice between
these two remains to be related to the coding process itself. This may involve the aim to
code for a very specific research question (which is related to a more theoretical approach), or
the research question evolves through the coding process (which is related to the inductive
approach).
Another decision the researcher needs to look at is whether the thematic analysis follows
an either semantic or latent approach. Semantic themes, for instance, show results that go
beyond of what the participants have said or written. Ideally, the results should display a
progression which involved the description of the data; the researcher should be able to provide a content that has been organised and which has specific characteristics, and contains
a summary for further interpretation. This allows to theorise the significance of the pat15 This

does not mean that the researcher should not be thinking about his/her theoretical commitments.

88

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations

terns and their broader meaning and conclusions. It also enables the discussion in relation
with previous findings within and across research fields. In contrast, the thematic analysis
at the latent level aims to identify the underlying ideas, assumptions and conceptualisations
in order to give the data a particular form and meaning. In doing so, the latent thematic
analysis requires an interpretative framework of the development of the themes themselves
and results that are not based around descriptions rather than have been theorised already.
In my thesis, I used a bottom-up approach based on a semantic level of thematic analysis.
The evaluation of simulation training and musicians’ perception of using simulation training is novel in the sense that this is the first study that looks at the benefits of simulation
training from a qualitative perspective (for more details, see Chapter 5). In doing so, the
thematic analysis allows me to work data-driven and to provide an in-depth analysis of the
patterns found within but more importantly across participants.

Specific research questions and hypotheses

Background and rationale The first attempt to introduce the taxonomy of stress dates back
to Selye in the early nineteenth century (Selye, 1936), who defined stress as a ‘non-specific’
endocrine response. Current stress research explains the phenomenon through the modulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in response to stressors, whereby both the sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) are involved with involuntary
regulation of key bodily functions, including heart rhythms, respiration and blood pressure
(Billman, 2011). When it comes to the biomarkers of stress, the time series of consecutive Rpeaks in the Electrocardiogram (ECG), referred to as heart rate variability, have been widely
adopted as robust signatures of stress (Thayer & Lane, 2009).
Musical performance is a particularly suitable and fruitful scenario for studying performance stress, in particular heart rate variability reactivity to stress (Williamon, 2004), as the
performance is both controllable for researchers and naturalistic for both the musicians and
the audience. The stressors in a musical performance are manifold, from bright spotlights,

2.3. Specific research questions and hypotheses

89

TV cameras and expert audiences, to the fact professional musicians are expected to deliver
performances of consistently high quality, whereby in the extreme the quality of a single
performance may determine their careers. Performance stress has been shown to occur regardless of age, sex, hours of practice and level of expertise. Even eminent musicians such
as the pianist Vladimir Horowitz and the singer Maria Callas were not beyond experiencing
it.
While the psychology of musical performance stress is an already maturing area, with several subjective stress assessment methods available, there is, from both the scientific and
practical perspective, much scope for the use of modern wearable sensing technologies,
as well as methodologies, to provide a quantitative and objective account of performance
stress, such as an assessment of the critical timing of stress reactivity.
Considering the existing music research and building on the promising new approaches
to analysing physiological responses to stress, the aim of this thesis is to provide further
understanding of musicians’ cardiovascular reactivity to stressful performance situations.
In particular, I sought specifically to examine the degree and timing of peak stress levels in
musicians experiencing performance stress.

2.3.1

The aims of this thesis

The aim of this thesis is to address conservatoire musicians’ cardiovascular reactivity to
stressful performance situations, by asking the following research questions:

• To what extent do physiological and psychological symptoms arise under different
performance contexts (e.g., low-stress rehearsal versus high-stress audition)?
• How is stress manifested over time, such as from the pre-performance period to the
performance itself?

These two questions are investigated by considering well-established standards in physiological assessments, as well as by comparing them against newer methods as proposed in

90

Chapter 2. Methodological considerations

complexity science (Chapters 3 & 4). In Chapter 3, the physiological response of an expert
musician was evaluated in low stress (a rehearsal) and high stress (a recital for 400 people)
performance conditions and along a piece of music of varying difficulty. The study aims
to answer the question of physiological changes in heart rate variability over time during a
low- and high-stress performance, as well as a comparison between the results provided by
the frequency domain analysis and the multiscale sample entropy performed in complexity
science.
Chapter 4 offers further insights into the degree and peak of cardiovascular reactivity between low- and high-stress performances. Musicians’ heart rate variability was monitored
during a 5-minute pre-performance period and during a low- and high-stress performance;
self-reported anxiety was collected prior to the events. This study was carried out in the
hopes to get a better understanding of the importance of the pre-performance period, as
well as to test and evaluate the frequency domain analysis and the multiscale sample entropy method in a larger sample.
Subsequent studies examine the impact of training programmes on physiological features,
including a qualitative and quantitative validation of simulated musical training environments (Chapters 5, 6 & 7) developed at the Royal College of Music. For the validation,
research questions of interest are:

• To what extent do simulated musical performance environments have an impact on
musicians physiological and psychological responses?
• Moreover, to what extent are they comparable to a real performance setting?

In Chapter 5, advanced violin students were recruited to perform in two simulations: a solo
recital with a small virtual audience and an audition situation with three ‘expert’ virtual
judges. Each simulation contained back-stage and on-stage areas, life-sized interactive virtual observers, and pre- and post-performance protocols designed to match those found at
leading international performance venues. Participants completed a questionnaire on their
experiences of using the simulations. The study was conducted to explore the face validity

2.3. Specific research questions and hypotheses

91

of the simulation training, expressed in physiological and psychological metrics, including
a comparison of musicians’ heart rate variability and feelings of anxiety before and during
simulated performance and real performance.
In Chapter 6, conservatoire students performed in two simulations: a recital with a virtual
audience and an audition with virtual judges. Qualitative data were collected through a
focus group interview and written reflective commentaries. The aim of this study was to
find the answer as to how musicians would use simulation training if it was part of their
everyday practice-curriculum.
Finally, in Chapter 7, data from twelve musicians who performed twice in the simulated
environment are reported. The heart rate variability was monitored throughout the performance including a 5-minute pre-performance period while self-reported anxiety was assessed before and after. The heart rate variability was examined in terms of standard frequency and multiscale sample entropy methods. This study was aimed to understand the
impact of positive versus negative feedback on stress responses, in particular we sought to
test the hypothesis that feedback of positive valence has a significantly different impact on
these responses than feedback of negative valence.
Chapter 8 offers a discussion based on the outcomes of studies carried out, as well as future
implications for research in the musical domain.

Introduction

Performing music in public requires the management of intense physical and mental demands. How musicians perceive and respond to these demands, and deliver high quality performances consistently under pressure, can determine not only the success of single
events but also the path and length of their careers (Kenny, 2011; Williamon, 2004).
In this respect, musicians are not unlike elite performers in other domains. Under intense
stress, physiological and psychological responses such as heart rate and level of state anxiety are markedly increased for both those who must work hard physically, such as athletes
(Bricout, DeChenaud, & Favre-Juvin, 2010), as well as those whose work requires mental exertion, such as surgeons (Arora et al., 2010) and chess grandmasters (Schwarz, Schächinger,
Adler, & Goetz, 2003). While the analysis of physiological responses is well explored in
sports science and in many clinical fields, studies in music, particularly those examining
stress in real-world contexts and at the highest of international levels, are rare.
Stress is managed by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). In particular, a reaction to stress
can be characterised by the interactions between two ANS components: the parasympa92

3.1. Introduction

93

thetic and sympathetic nervous systems (Berntson & Cacioppo, 2004: for more details, see
Chapter 2). Stress often causes a decrease in the mean R-R (increased heart rate) in healthy
individuals, with the opposite effect in chronically stressed individuals (Schubert et al.,
2009), while in the case of standard deviation, certain studies have found that it fails to
identify the effects of mentally stressed individuals stress on heart rate variability (Taelman,
Vandeput, Spaepen, & Van Huffel, 2009). To put this into context, Schubert et al. (2009)
examined the short-term stress effects on heart rate variability using complexity domain
measures (phase domain measures) and frequency domain analysis in fifty (healthy) participants. The short-term effects of stress were investigated through a short speech task and
participants’ changes in cardiac output were measures through monitoring their ECG (including breathing) throughout. The results showed a significant increase in in mean heart
rate and standard deviation in R-R fluctuations, LF power and decreased HF power for the
speech task, while the LF/HF ratio and the respiratory sinus arrhythmia did not change.
Based on these observation, the authors conclude that the stress condition reflect a lowered
functionality of the cardiovascular activity and confirm the importance of the complexity
metrics in modern stress research on heart rate variability. Taelman et al. (2009) addressed
the problem to analyse and identify period of stress by recording alterations in heart rate
and heart rate variability by means of exposing 28 participants to two conditions: a task
with and without a mental stressor. For this, participants were first provided with relaxing pictures in order to make them feel calm and then required to execute a mental task.
The heart rate variability was analysed in terms of time or frequency domain analysis, and
metrics of interest were: mean and standard deviation (SD) of R-R, mean and SD of heart
rate, root mean square of SD, NN50 (number of consecutive R-R intervals that differ more
than 50 ms) and pNN50 (proportion of NN50). Frequently used spectral components extracted included the very low frequency bands (VLF: 0 −0.04 Hz), low frequency bands (LF:
0.04 −0.15 Hz) and high frequency bands (HF: 0.15 −0.4 Hz) and the ratio of LF/HF. The results revealed a significantly lower mean R-R during the mental task and compared to the
resting state. The pNN50 was significantly higher in the relaxed condition than during the
exposure to the mental task, while the standard deviation did not vary significantly between

94 Chapter 3. Changes in heart rate variability during musical performance: A case study
the two performance tasks. For the results of the frequency domain analysis, all frequency
components were not significantly different between conditions; only the LF/HF exhibited
a slightly higher power during the mental task (although non-significantly so).
In recent years, studies of heart rate variability have focused on its low frequency (LF) and
high frequency (HF) components: 0.04 −0.15 Hz and 0.15 −0.4 Hz, respectively (for more
details, see Chapter 2). Pharmacological studies have found that stress typically causes an
increase in SNS activity while reciprocally causing a withdrawal in PNS activity, a phenomenon known as the sympatho-vagal balance. However, in practice the response of the
ANS to stress is diverse and depends on the nature of the stressor (physical, psychological)
and in some cases the individual (Berntson & Cacioppo, 2004). For instance, a study of psychological stress found much greater changes in PNS activity for some individuals and SNS
activity in others (Berntson, Cacioppo, & Quigley, 1991). Nonetheless it has been proposed
that the LF/HF power ratio, a relative measure, can characterise the balance relationship between the SNS and PNS (Pagani et al., 1986) and has been widely used to study the effect of
stress on performance.
Nakahara, Furuya, Obata, Masuko, and Kinoshita (2009) compared the LF/HF ratio elicited
while musicians performed and listened to music, finding a higher ratio during performance. In their study, they asked thirteen elite pianists to undergo different performances,
including the conditions of expressive piano playing, non-expressive piano playing, expressive listening and non-expressive listening. The results showed that the expressive condition
not only triggered an increased LF/HF ratio, but also a significantly increase in the highfrequency activity. Furthermore, a greater modulation of both were observed during the
expressive performance compared to the perception task alone. The findings suggest that
the performance itself has a greater effect on the (emotion-related) modulation on the cardiac
activity than the listening task, including a reciprocal change of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activity. Harmat et al. (2010) studied heart rate and heart rate variability in
professional singers and flautists during low and high stress performances, and they found
increased heart rate and suppressed heart rate variability in the high stress condition, but
contrary to predictions from previous research (Berntson & Cacioppo, 2004), LF power was

3.1. Introduction

95

significantly lower in high stress. In another study, Harmat et al. (2010) examined heart
rate and heart rate variability in expert pianists while playing a familiar piece and while
sight-reading a technically demanding unfamiliar piece. They found significantly higher LF
power in the latter condition, which corresponded to a more cognitively demanding and (by
implication) more stressful task.
The ambiguities and inconsistencies encountered using the traditional LF/HF model might
be explained by recent work (Billman, 2013; Schubert et al., 2009), which has argued that
it over-simplifies the complex relationship between the SNS and PNS, and challenges its
accuracy. Thus far, the assumption that the HF/HF reflects the sympatho-vagal balance has
been expressed through the following hypotheses: Firstly, the the SNS activity is exclusively
relevant for the activity in the LF power in the heart rate variability. Furthermore, the similar
concept accounts for the PNS activity, which is allegedly predominately responsible for a
peak in the HF power. Secondly, the consequences of physiological challenges through stress
or any other physiological diseases trigger a reciprocal changes in the cardiac sympathetic
and parasympathetic nerve activity, and are usually experienced by a diminish in the SNS
and vice versa. Lastly, any changes in the SNS and PNS activity are based on a simple linear
interaction and can be obtained through the extraction of the spectral density in the heart
rate variability.
Recent studies, however have begun to challenge these assumptions and demonstrate the
hypothesis aforementioned follow a too simplistic view on the humans’ physiology to stress.
Instead, Billman (2013) claims a more complex and non-linear interaction between both
divisions of the autonomic nervous system, which has been predominantly shown in the
ambivalent findings of the LF activity to stress. For instance, studies have found that betaadrenoceptor blockade (a medication that inactivates the SNS) only leads to a reduction of
LF power by up to 50%. Moreover, when both SNS and PNS activity were externally regulated, the LF/HF ratio showed an increase from the baseline of up to 80%, suggesting a false
shift in the sympathetic dominance. To provide a similar example, other studies assessed the
impact of interventions such as acute exercise on the cardiac sympathetic activity (Houle &
Billman, 1999); although the results showed a large increase in heart rate, the LF/HF ratio

96 Chapter 3. Changes in heart rate variability during musical performance: A case study
remained unchanged, further strengthening the assumption that the relationship between
the LF and HF is more complicated than previously postulated. This has motivated us to
investigate more appropriate methods for modelling the variable interactions within R-R
rhythms in conditions of stress.
Complexity science quantifies the ability of a living system to adapt to changes in the environment characterised by long term auto- and cross-correlations within its physiological
responses (coupled dynamics) at different scales. Multiscale sample entropy (MSE) is one
such method that evaluates signal regularity, determined by sample entropy, across multiple temporal scales and is particularly suited to revealing long-range correlations—a key
property of complex systems (Costa et al., 2002; Costa, Goldberger, & Peng, 2005: for more
details, see Chapter 2). In the context of heart rate variability, the MSE method has the advantage of being able to examine R-R fluctuations independent of their absolute magnitude
(relative measure) with a high degree of accuracy (the algorithm is sensitive to nonlinear
couplings) and without making rigid assumptions about the underlying generating mechanisms as is the case with the LF/HF ratio. Studies of stress level changes induced in heart
rate variability by physical exertion (Turianikova, Javorka, Baumert, Calkovska, & Javorka,
2011) or meditation (Sarkar & Fletcher, 2014) suggest that complexity—determined by the
MSE approach—is lowest during states of high stress, a result that is consistent with the
complexity-loss theory. Despite the potential of the method in the study of stress the precise
data conditioning and pre-processing steps undertaken prior to MSE analysis are often not
reported, yet these have a major impact on the coherence and interpretation of the results.

Aims of the present study

Music is a natural domain for studying the response to high stress performance situations
given that musical performance requires considerable motor precision integrated with sustained management of cognitive, perceptual and social processes (Williamon, 2004). While
consistency in executing domain-specific skills over time is a characteristic of expertise in
any domain (Ericsson, 2008), the degree of physical control exhibited by an expert classical

3.1. Introduction

97

musician in repeated performances (Hunsaker, 1994; Inesta, Terrados, Garcia, & Perez, 2008)
offers a unique opportunity to study the degree of stress caused by public performance.
The heart rate variability of a concert pianist was assessed for performances of the same
work in low stress and high stress conditions. We set out to dynamically examine stress
signatures caused by (1) varying physical and cognitive demands within the musical piece
(identical across performances) and (2) audience-induced anxiety (different across performances). For rigour, heart rate variability analysis was performed using standard and stateof-the-art techniques with identical pre-processing (considered frequency range, identical
time windows) applied where relevant, in this way ensuring a fair comparison between the
analysis methods.

3.1.1

Method

Participant

Melvyn Tan (born 1956) is an internationally renowned pianist and performs regularly in
many of the world’s leading concert halls.

Procedure

A preliminary health screening was first conducted. Electrocardiography (ECG) data were
recorded for performances under a low stress condition, where only the performer and research team were present, and a high stress condition with an audience of 400 people at the
2012 Cheltenham Music Festival. The data were collected wirelessly at a sampling rate of
250 Hz using a Zephyr Bioharness (Johnstone et al., 2012a, 2012b). Analysis was focused
on data obtained during the first piece in the recital programme, J.S. Bach’s English Suite
in A minor (BWV 807), where early stages of performance are particularly physically and
psychologically stressful (Martens et al., 1990).

98 Chapter 3. Changes in heart rate variability during musical performance: A case study
Data treatment

Each performance produced approximately 20 minutes of ECG data. The time difference
between successive R peaks in ECG was estimated, which was converted into an R-R time
series with samples at regular time intervals of 0.25 s using cubic spline interpolation. The
R-R signal was bandpass filtered (0.04 −0.4 Hz) via a 4th order Butterworth filter before
estimating the following features via overlapping windows of the same length:

• Standard deviation of the R-R signal about its mean
• Power in the low frequency (0.04 −0.15 Hz) and high frequency components
(0.15 −0.4 Hz) of the R-R signal obtained using a 4th order Butterworth filter
• LF/HF ratio obtained from the estimated power in the LF and HF bands;
• Sample entropy (SE) estimated at different time scales for the complete frequency
range (0.04 −0.4 Hz), the low frequency range (0.04 −0.15 Hz) and the high frequency
range (0.15 −0.4 Hz). In all cases, each window segment was normalised (zero mean,
unit variance) before estimating the SE with the embedding dimension and tolerance
level at 2 and 0.15, respectively (see Multiscale sample entropy below).

Windows of 7 min length were selected as the longest period of the considered R-R component was 25 s (0.04 Hz) and incorporation of at least 10 times the lowest oscillation period are advised in heart rate variability analysis to sample short-term variations adequately
(Berntson et al., 1997). It is worth noting that the LF/HF ratio and the MSE method, when
estimated over normalised data segments, are relative measures, and do not depend on the
absolute scaling of the R-R data.

Multiscale sample entropy (MSE)

MSE estimation is performed by two steps:

• The different temporal scales are estimated by coarse graining (moving average) the Nsample time series, xi, i=1,. . . N. For a scale factor, ε, the corresponding coarse-grained
time series is given by: yj ε =(1/ε) Σi xi where i=(j-1)ε+1,. . . , jε and j = 1, . . . , N/ε.
• The sample entropy (SE) is evaluated for each intrinsic scale yjε. Underpinning the
method is the estimation of the conditional probability that two similar sequences will
remain similar when the next data point is included. First, composite delay vectors
of the scale are formed, with embedding dimension M, and the average number of
neighbouring delay vectors for a given tolerance level, r, are estimated. This is known
as the frequency-of-occurrence and reflects the level of self-similarity within the scale.
This process is repeated for an embedding dimension of M+1, and the ratio of the two
frequency-of-occurrence values gives the SE of the scale.

Results

Table 3.1 shows the completion time of each movement within the piece of music. The time
difference between the two performances was 24 s, reflecting a high degree of consistency
over a 20 minute task and enabling a fair comparison across performances. The performer
reported an increase in perceived pressure during the performance in front of the audience.
He furthermore reported that the Prelude and Courante (the first and third movements)
were the most challenging in both scenarios.

13.1 relative to the window length (7 min). Figure 3.2 show the results of the basic measures
of heart rate variability. Figure 3.2a shows the R-R interval time series for the same performance under the low (grey line) and high stress (black line) performance conditions. The
mean R-R interval for the high stress condition was significantly lower than that for the low
stress condition (the Bhattacharyya coefficient, a measure of the amount of overlap between
two distributions, was zero). Figure 3.2b shows the standard deviation of the R-R time series
filtered within the frequency range 0.04 −0.4 Hz. The standard deviation was lower for the
high stress performance (black line), conforming with some studies of the effects of stress on
R-R standard deviation (Schubert et al., 2009). There was a high level of similarity between
the relative changes in standard deviation for each of the two performances: the standard
deviation decreased at around 600 s. This result may support the reported difficulty experienced during the Courante, which ended at 578 s (high stress performance), and indicates
a reduction in stress possibly caused by the relief at having completed and passed through
the most challenging parts of the piece, the reduced physical demands of the subsequent
musical material, or both.
Figure 3.3a shows the total power in the LF bands (upper plot) and HF bands (lower plot).
The high stress performance (black line) resulted in reduced HF activity but also in a decrease in the LF activity (grey line). Thus the LF/HF ratio, as shown in Figure 3.3b, was as
expected for the initial stages of performance—it was highest for the high stress condition—
but for performance times after approximately 600s the ratio of the low stress condition
was highest. This runs counter to predictions of the physiological stress model based on an
increase in the LF/HF ratio (Berntson & Cacioppo, 2004) and suggests that the ratio is inconsistent. Nonetheless, the relative decreases observed for the standard deviation features
after approximately 600 s, potentially caused by the shift into less challenging movements
of the piece, is also found in the LF/HF analysis.
Figures 3.3c and 3.3d show the results of the sample entropy (SE) analysis applied to the
complete frequency range (0.04 −0.4 Hz) for the first (no coarse graining) and second scale
factors, respectively. The results indicate lower complexity, particularly at the second scale
factor, for the high stress performance (black line), which is in agreement with previous

results: high stress conditions yield lower complexity. In this way the results are similar
to those for the LF/HF ratio (Figure 3.3b), and yet a greater separation between the two
performances was facilitated by the MSE analysis (Figure 3.3d). Also, a relative increase in
complexity was found in both the high and low stress performances at around 600 s, which
is consistent with the standard deviation and LF/HF analyses.
For the same scale factors, the SE of the LF band only is given in Figures 3.3e and 3.3 f ,
and the SE for the HF band only is given in Figures 3.3g and 3.3h. The SE analysis for
the HF band discriminates between the high stress (black line) and low stress (grey line)
performances and is consistent with complexity loss theory, but there was no separation for
the LF band. In both cases (Figures 3.3e-3.3h), however, a relative increase in complexity was
not observed at around 600 s.

Discussion

This study is the first rigorous examination of real-world autonomic response in the musical domain, demonstrating the degree of physiological change experienced by an expert
musician when performing in public. Both standard and state-of-the-art tools were used
to examine dynamically the components of heart rate governed by autonomic control, revealing signatures in heart rate variability that indicate higher stress levels caused by public
performance and also technically challenging movements in the considered piece.
In this instance, basic measures (mean R-R, R-R standard deviation) were able to distinguish
clearly between the states of low and high stress. The results of the standard deviation analysis also provide insight into the reported difficulties experienced by the performer during
the first and third movements of the piece, as the relative values decreased once the third
movement ended, suggesting a relative decrease in stress. It is well known, however, that
such basic measures are not always reliable as disparate results have been reported in the
literature (Billman, 2013). Another disadvantage is that these measures are based on the absolute magnitude of the R-R signal whereas, in general, relative measures of a process are
understood to exhibit greater consistency.
The results of the two relative measures, the LF/HF ratio and the multiscale sample entropy
(MSE) method, were similar when applied to the same R-R frequency components: both
methods indicate a higher level of stress for the first part of the performance and both indicate a relative decrease in stress after the end of the third movement. However, the LF/HF
ratio exhibits inconsistent results from 600 s suggesting the performance for the audience
became less stressful than the performance without an audience, contradicting the reported
experience of the musician. On the other hand, the MSE method clearly shows lower regularity across the intrinsic data scales for the state of high stress—indicating a lower complexity of the physiological state. The results are in agreement with the complexity-loss theory
for living organisms under constraint: stress causes a reduction in complexity. In addition,
it was found that the complexity of the HF band, typically associated with PNS activity, was

104 Chapter 3. Changes in heart rate variability during musical performance: A case study
reduced for the state of high stress. Little change in complexity was observed in the LF band.
At this point it is important to state that changes in the heart rate variability are not only
caused by an activation of the SNS and the calming activity of the PNS. Although this
metaphor has more relevance when it comes to alteration in the cardiovascular responses,
in other parts of the ANS it may be the PNS that functions as the main drive to increase the
body functioning (Levenson, 2014). For instance, the PNS is responsible for an increase in
the activation of the salivary glands, the production or tears and the activity of the stomach
and the intestine.
The second and third misconception that needs to be considered is that (1) the heart rate
variability and the respiratory sinus arrhythmia are indexes of the entire vagus nerve or,
an even more detrimental assumption, the entire PNS, and that (2) the ANS is primarily
responsible to cause an increase or a decrease in activity of the targeted organ. In reality, the
main bulk of the neural traffic in the vagus nerve is not efferent rather than afferent in nature,
with vagal fibres that collect information of the body state and transmit the information
back to the brain (for more details, see Chapter 1). Such afferent function is crucial when
considering and theorising about the role of the ANS and the stress of performing from a
bottom-up process (e.g., the emotion experienced and the cognition during performing affects
the activity of the ANS: Levenson, 2014).
As such, while this case study offers valuable insight into how MSE analysis can be applied
to data collected in real-world contexts, subsequent investigations are needed to establish
the extent in which the results generalise to larger samples of expert performers and to those
at lower levels of skill. Also, the MSE method should be extended to investigate jointly the
dynamics of other physiological parameters (e.g., respiration rate) under stressful conditions. Finally, the utility of physiological complexity as a measure in stress-reduction interventions needs to be investigated, such as in cognitive-behavioural training or biofeedback.
The findings reported here also offer promising new avenues for identifying stress responses
in a wide range of performance situations, both in music and in other performance domains.

before and during musical performance

Introduction

The reactivity of heart rate variability has been examined under a variety of performance
conditions, such as public speaking (Pull, 2012) and sports competitions, including BMX
races (Mateo, Blasco-Lafarga, Martinez-Navarro, Guzman, & Zabala, 2012), judo (Morales
et al., 2013) and volleyball (D’Ascenzi et al., 2014). Blasquez, Font, and Ortis (2009), for
instance, compared state anxiety and heart rate variability during a baseline measure to a
competition in swimmers, detecting a significant elevation in state anxiety, LF power and
the LF/HF ratio, while a significant parasympathetic withdrawal was observed by a diminished HF power. Similar outcomes were provided by Mateo et al. (2012), examining eleven
BMX drivers in a two-day competition in contrast to a two-day baseline (training) measure.
Monitored was competitive state anxiety and heart rate variability during a 20-minute preperformance period and the actual performance. The heart rate variability was analyzed in
terms of its frequency distributions and the degree of beat-to-beat self-similarities. The index
of self-similarity is extracted by the application of sample entropy. The results showed significant elevated competitive state anxiety, as well as a significant effect of all six conditions,
indicating a slow down in the vagal tone expressed by a decreased HF power and sample

entropy during the pre-performance period in both days of the competitions and compared
to the baseline measure. Morales et al. (2013) examined the changes in heart rate variability before judo competitions in 24 athletes of different level of national and international
performance experience. Each participant rated their level of competitive anxiety using the
the Revised Competitive State Anxiety Inventory (CSAI-2R) and their heart rate variability
was recorded during both an official and unofficial competition. The heart rate variability was analysed using frequency domain analysis. The results showed that internationalstandard athletes have a higher confidence, mean R-R interval, standard deviation of R-R,
square root of the mean squared difference of successive R-R intervals, short-term variability,
long-term variability compared to national-standard judo athletes. The hypothesis that judo
athletes with international-standard experience lower anxiety than their less-experienced
counterparts was verified. In addition, the national-standard judo athletes showed a higher
pre-competitive anxiety which was associated with a an increase in sympathetic and a decrease in parasympathetic activity. In particular, the HF power was significantly higher in
international-standard athletes than in national- standard athletes. In contrast, the LF/HF
ratio was higher in less experienced athletes, and greater in official competitions than in unofficial competitions, while the LF activity showed neither a significant effect of the type of
competition nor an interaction between level of experience and type of competition.

These studies have provided evidence that heart rate variability reflects changes in stress
levels in the pre-performance period—the time before a performance is due to commence—
characterized by a decreased physical and cognitive adaptability during pre-task appraisal;
this in turn shapes physiological stress responses and quality of performance (Hanin & Hanina, 2009). Yet, to date there are no systematic studies of comparative stress responses in the
pre-performance vs. performance period, not a consensus on the duration of those periods—
open literature reports the examined periods ranging from several minutes up to a day. Musical performance is a particularly fruitful domain for studying and understanding reactivity
to psychosocial stress (Williamon, 2004). Professional musicians must deliver consistently
high quality performances for knowledgeable and demanding. The physical, environmental, and cognitive demands of musical performance often lead to increased levels of anxiety

4.1. Introduction

107

and self-efficacy, which may have detrimental effects on the performance quality. The outcomes of a single performance may determine—or at least believed by the musicians to be
determining—the course of their careers (Brodsky, 1996). While the psychology of music
performance has been studied for several decades, corresponding investigations of cardiovascular reactivity to performance stress, and in particular to the critical timing of that reactivity, have been limited.
Craske and Craig (1984) examined physiological stress reactivity of 40 musicians over the 35 minute periods both in private in public. Heart rate was extracted at 100, 40, and 10 s prior
to and 120, 140, 260 and 400 s after the first note played, and the musicians’ state anxiety
(Spielberger et al., 1983) was measured before each performance. The results indicate that
the heart rate, when collapsed (averaged) together at times prior to and during playing,
significantly differed between the two conditions, with the performance in public triggering
both the highest physical arousal (objective measure of autonomous body response) and
reported state anxiety (subjective measure). Abel and Larkin (1990) recruited 22 musicians
to perform in front of a panel of judges. The pre-performance time was divided into two
anticipatory periods: a warm-up period (5 min before) and the time between the final stage
call and the performance (2 min before). The heart rate was extracted 12 times per min at
baseline for 6 min, as well as for the 5-minute warm-up period and the 2-minute final call.
State anxiety (Spielberger et al., 1983) was also measured at baseline and in each anticipatory
period. They reported elevated levels of the heart rate and state anxiety during the two
anticipatory periods compared with baseline measurements, with the highest physiological
reactivity and state anxiety in the period immediately prior to entering the stage. However,
the validity of this study was compromised by the fact that heart rate was not collected
during the performance itself, which prohibits direct comparison with the pre-performance
periods.
The above studies indicate that there are at least two reasons for a void in the current literature when it comes to the conclusive evidence of timing and degree of musicians’ cardiovascular reactivity to acute psychosocial stress. Firstly, the existing studies were based on heart
rate rather than heart rate variability (Abel & Larkin, 1990; Brotons, 1994; Craske & Craig,

108

Chapter 4. Changes in heart rate variability before and during musical performance

1984; Yoshie, Shigemasu, et al., 2009), yet it is the frequency domain analysis of heart rate
variability that yields clinically relevant frequency components (Milicevic, 2005) in ECG (for
more details, see Chapter 2). Secondly, current studies offer no hard-and-fast rule on the
duration of pre-performance periods, ranging anywhere from 100 s to 5 min, nor a consensus on interval lengths for the monitoring of heart rate variability, which leaves open the
key issue of the selection of parameters for the detection of subtle changes in physical body
response (for more details, see Chapter 2).

To this end, the structural complexity of heart rate variability has recently attracted significant attention in the investigation of cardiovascular response to psychosocial stress (Peng,
Havlin, Stanley, & Goldberger, 1995). The use of MSE in analysing the performance-related
stress is quite intuitive: (1) an unconstrained human system adapts freely to a constantly
changing environment and therefore exhibits high MSE at larger scales (high complexity);
(2) stress is an inhibition restricts the freedom in non-linear dynamics of heart rate variability and other stress biomarkers thus resulting in lower sample entropy values at higher
scales (i.e., low complexity: Gao et al., 2013). It is therefore both convenient and physically
meaningful to examine the stress signatures in musicians within the so-called complexity loss
theory which states than an organism under constraints (illness, ageing, any other inhibition) exhibit lower complexity (MSE level are higher scales) of its physiological responses
compared to a healthy, unconstrained, organism. Existing studies analysed heart rate variability in the context of mental stress (Visnovcova et al., 2014), cardiovascular disease (Tuzcu
et al., 2006) and public performance (Williamon et al., 2013), and have provided conclusive
evidence of lower complexity in heart rate variability with increased stress (Costa et al.,
2002; Costa, Goldberger, & Peng, 2005). To put this into context, Visnovcova et al. (2014)
for instance, studied the complexity and time asymmetry of short-term heart rate variability
by evaluating participants’ ECG at rest and during and after two stressors, including the
commonly known and widely established Stroop test and an arithmetic test in 70 healthy
participants. Heart rate variability was analysed using the spectral powers in low and high
frequency bands. The results revealed a withdrawal in vagal activity by mean of a loss in the
HF power in both stressors, and a significant increase in LF power during the Stroop task.

4.1. Introduction

109

In contrast, the arithmetic task caused a reverse effect, a significant decrease in LF power,
which the authors assume is a result of the different intensity in stress between the two tasks.
Similarly, Tuzcu et al. (2006) assessed changes in heart rate complexity prior to the onset of
atrial fibrillation (i.e., condition that leads an irregular and often abnormal increase in heart
rate). 25 patients’s ECG was monitored during two 30 min time intervals and the recording
was divided into three 10 min segments. The data was evaluated using sample entropy used
in complexity science. The results showed that the sample entropy for the R-R fluctuations
were significantly reduced before the period of the atrial fibrillation (lowest sample entropy
was observed during the last 10 min prior the onset) compared to the time after the atrial
fibrillation.
As shown in Chapter 3, where I examined complexity of heart rate variability of an expert
pianist for the first 20 minutes of a low- and high-stress performance, results show that:
(1) complexity of heart rate variability significantly decreased during the high-stress performance, and (2) the MSE analysis exhibits much higher discrimination in distinguishing
between the stress conditions. While this pilot study was the first finding of its kind in realworld (non-laboratory) performance conditions, further investigations over larger number
of musicians, across a variety performance contexts, and benchmarking against the anxiety
self-tests are required for a conclusive proof-of-concept, a subject of this chapter.

4.1.1

Method

Participants

Eleven violinists from the Royal College of Music, London, and six flautists from the Conservatory of Southern Switzerland, Lugano, participated in the study (9 men, 8 women; the
mean age and standard deviation (SD) were: 23.23 years, SD= 2.84). Participants were required to give multiple, polished performances, of the Allemande from J. S. Bach’s Partita No.
2 in D minor for solo violin (BWV 1004) or the Allemande from J. S. Bach’s Partita in A minor
for solo flute (BWV 1013). The research was granted ethical approval by the Conservatoires

110

Chapter 4. Changes in heart rate variability before and during musical performance

UK Research Ethics Committee and was conducted according to ethical guidelines of the
British Psychological Society. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and no
payment was given in exchange for participation.

ECG

For the violinists, ECG was recorded using a wireless commercial device 80x40x15mm,
weight 35g), the Zephyr Bioharness, which snaps onto an elasticated chest belt (width
50mm, weight 50g) and operates at a sampling rate of 250 Hz (for more details, see Chapter
2).
For the flautists, data were collected using a well-established PowerLab (Radespiel-Troeger,
Rauh, Mahlke, Gottschalk, & Muck-Weymann, 2003) recording device (model 26T), with
electrodes attached to the chest and in intercostal spaces (wherever possible between ribs VI
and VII). A further electrode was positioned between ribs VI and VII; the raw signal was
acquired at a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz.

State anxiety

Prior to each performance, participants completed Form Y1 (state anxiety) of the State-Trait
Anxiety Inventory (STAI: Spielberger et al., 1983), a 20-item questionnaire measuring the
emotional state a person is experiencing based on subjective feelings of nervousness and
perceived activation and arousal (for more details, see Chapter 2). To put our results into
context, moderate levels of anxiety in young men give the score of 36.47 (SD = 10.02) as
compared to 38.76 (SD = 11.95) for young women.

Procedure

Induction session At the start of the study, each of the 17 participants attended a 20minute induction session, at which point they confirmed that they would be able to deliver

4.1. Introduction

111

multiple, polished performances (with written repeats) of either the Allemande from J. S.
Bach’s Partita No. 2 in D minor for solo violin (BWV 1004) or the Allemande from J. S. Bach’s
Partita in A minor for solo flute (BWV 1013). They also provided background information
on their musical experience, and a preliminary health screening was conducted. On explicit
questioning, all participants confirmed that they were not currently taking anxiolytic medication or other substances that may affect their perceptions of or alter any physiological
responses to performing.

Low- and high-stress performance conditions The musicians were asked to arrive 30 minutes before each of two scheduled performances to be fitted with the Bioharness (violinists)
or electrodes (flautists) and to prepare for their performance as they would normally (e.g.,
warming-up, tuning, rehearsing, etc.). Stage calls were given by a member of the research
team—acting as the backstage manager—at 15 min and 5 min before. At 0 min, participants
were escorted to a backstage area, asked to complete Form Y1 of the STAI, and required
to wait a further 5 min while the backstage manager confirmed that the performance space
was adequately prepared. ECG recordings made during this time are referred to below as
the pre-performance data. They then entered either an empty room (low stress) or a room with
an audition panel with three adjudicators (high stress), where they were asked to perform
the designated piece lasting 5.06 min (SD=0.22) for the violinists and 5.19 min (SD=0.10) for
the flautists, referred to below as the performance data. The order of conditions was counterbalanced, and participants were informed in advance of whether they were to perform
in the empty room or for the audition panel. ECG data were recorded throughout each session, and all performances were video recorded. The performance protocol is summarised
in Figure 4.1.

Data treatment and analyses

The ECG data were prepared using MATLAB (R2013a) and analysed in SPSS (version 22).1
R-R intervals were detected using cubic spline interpolation and median filter with samples
at regular time intervals of 0.25 s. After applying the fourth-order Butterworth filter, the
mean and standard deviation of the R-R, LF and HF components, the LF/HF ratio and the
SE features were calculated for both the pre-performance and performance data (for more
details, see Chapter 4).
Preliminary comparisons of ECG measures between the violinists and the flautists, as well
as the impact of breathing on heart rate variability, revealed no significant differences or
interactions; therefore, data from the two samples have been combined and presented as
one dataset. Subsequently, for all extracted features, a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Greenhouse-Geisser correction was calculated, examining the effect of
time (pre-performance versus performance), condition (low-stress versus high-stress performance), and their interaction.2 The state anxiety inventory (STAI-Y1) administered before
the low- and high-stress performances was analysed using a paired-samples t-test.

Results

LF power, which is generally associated with SNS activity and the baroreceptor reflex,
showed a significant effect of time (F1,16 =10.139; p<0.01; ηp2 =.38), no significant effect of
condition (F1,16 =0.24; p=0.88; ηp2 =.01), and a significant interaction between time and condition (F1,16 =11.725; p<0.01; ηp2 =.42). Figure 4.2a shows LF before and during the low-stress
and the high-stress performances. LF increased from pre-performance to the performance
period in the low-stress condition, reflecting an increase in reactivity over time, while remaining stable throughout the high-stress condition.
HF power, generally associated with PNS activity and the respiratory sinus arrhythmia,
showed a significant effect for both time (F1,16 =15.280; p<0.01; ηp2 =.48) and condition
(F1,16 =8.911; p<0.01; ηp2 =.35), with no significant interaction between time and condition
(F1,16 =0.003; p=.95; ηp2 =.00). As shown in Figure 4.2b, HF power was generally more
elevated in the low-stress performance, and for both conditions, it increased from preperformance to performance.
The LF/HF ratio, which is an indication of the sympatho-vagal balance with higher ratios suggesting higher overall stress levels, showed a significant effect of time (F1,16 =6.848;
p<0.05; ηp2 =.30) and condition (F1,16 =9.763; p<0.01; ηp2 =.37) and a significant interaction between time and condition (F1,16 =10.914; p<0.01; ηp2 =.40). Figure 4.2c shows that there was
an elevated LF/HF ratio in the pre-performance period for the high-stress condition, indicating that physiological response to high stress peaked during the anticipatory period in
line with previous research (Craske & Craig, 1984; Williamon, Aufegger, & Eiholzer, 2014).
However, the results indicate that physiological response during the high-stress condition
then reduced to levels comparable with those of the low-stress condition. This latter, somewhat perplexing finding concurs with the results of Chapter 1, in which standard heart rate
variability frequency domain analysis was shown to be less accurate at assessing average
stress response than the new MSE method.

demonstrated a significant effect of time (F1,16 =25.127; p<0.001; ηp2 =.49) and condition
(F1,16 =15.940; p<0.01; ηp2 =.61), and no significant interaction between time and condition
(F1,16 =.214; p=.65; ηp2 =.01). In both the low- and high-stress performances complexity for the
full frequency spectrum was lowest during the pre-performance period, reflecting greater
reactivity, and increased in the performance period, reflecting a reduction in reactivity (Figure 4.2d). As predicted from the results of Williamon et al. (2013), the lowest complexity,
indicating the greatest stress reactivity, was found in the high-stress performance.

State Anxiety

The musicians’ state anxiety significantly increased from the low- (mean=34.00, SD=7.78) to
the high-stress condition (mean=38.71, SD=7.03; t(16) = -2.735; p<.05).

4.2

Discussion

This study examined the degree of cardiovascular reactivity experienced by musicians before and during performances in low- and high-stress conditions. This was achieved by
analysing power spectral density of heart rate variability and by using the state-of-the-art
sample entropy analysis of heart rate variability. The sample entropy approach made it possible to achieve robust discrimination of the underlying features related to the dynamics of
the heart regulated by the autonomic nervous system. The analysis indicated that highest
stress reactivity levels are elicited in the pre-performance period, compared with that during
performance, particularly so in the high-stress condition. For rigour, these objective stress
metrics were benchmarked against the subjective self-reported state anxiety scores by the
musicians.
The standard heart rate variability frequency analysis showed a statistically significant
increase in the LF but not the HF spectral power in heart rate variability from the preperformance to the performance period, suggesting a modulation of both the sympathetic
and parasympathetic nervous systems during the physiological act of performing music.
Between performance conditions the HF power was as expected higher for the low-stress
condition, suggesting an increased PNS activity and more relaxed physical state. Conversely, the LF power, which is believed to reflect the SNS activity and to be increased during
stress, was more elevated in the high-stress condition. While this result does not confirm the
commonly believed relationship between the LF power and the SNS in response to stress,
is in agreement with more recent studies that postulate that the LF power does not accurately reflect the SNS activity. When analysing both the LF power and HF power together

116

Chapter 4. Changes in heart rate variability before and during musical performance

via the LF/HF ratio, we observed the highest level of physiological stress reactivity in the
pre-performance period, when musicians were simply waiting to perform. In contrast, the
LF/HF ratio then decreased to levels comparable with the low-stress condition during the
actual performance—a counterintuitive result that requires further investigations.
The sample entropy analysis confirmed this greater stress response (lower complexity) in
the pre-performance period, but unlike the standard heart rate variability frequency domain
analysis, the more powerful sample entropy has been able to identify a higher state of stress
during the high-stress performance.
This study is not without limitations. The results of this study are somewhat limited by
the rather modest sample size and focus on heart rate variability only. Future studies may,
therefore, consider a larger sample alongside additional physiological and psychological
measures such as electroencephalographic data, breathing or musicians’ flexibility to adapt
emotionally, cognitively or behaviourally to psychosocial stress. This may, for instance, be
done by comparing musicians’ heart rate variability and breathing alongside coping strategies, self-efficacy or overall performance quality during different performance events and
in different performance contexts (Elliot, Payen, Brisswalter, Cury, & Thayer, 2011). Secondly, while this study provides an in-depth understanding of peak stress responses, subsequent studies should investigate how the MSE method may be used to interpret physiological control (Tan, 2013; Tan et al., 2009). This may enable future research to build upon
pre-performance stress reduction tools as an attempt to seek control over highly stressful
situations.
In summary, the results shown an increase in LF and HF power from the pre-performance
to the performance period, suggesting a dominant modulation of both the sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous systems during the physical act of making music (Berntson &
Cacioppo, 2004; Inesta et al., 2008); however, taking both the LF and HF together via the
LF/HF ratio, the results show that the highest level of physiological stress reactivity occurs
in the pre-performance period, while musicians are simply waiting to perform. The results
of the MSE analysis overall confirmed a greater stress response (lower complexity) in the

4.2. Discussion

117

pre-performance period, but unlike the standard heart rate variability frequency domain
analysis, the MSE, in particular for the full frequency spectrum, was able to show greater
separation of physiological stress responses within and between each performance condition.

5 | Introducing simulation training

5.1

Introduction

Exceptional musical performances require an ability to execute complex physical and mental
skills on stage under intense pressure and public scrutiny. While many of these skills can be
honed through deliberate practice (Ericsson, Krampe, & Tesch-Roemer, 1993), opportunities
to gather experience on stage, which is simultaneously rich in contextual complexity and
yet safe to allow musicians to experiment and develop artistically, are rare. Here, we report
a new educational and training initiative aimed at creating realistic, interactive performance
scenarios using simulation.
A high quality virtual environment should offer a three dimensional visual experience of
weight, height, and depth and provide ‘. . . an interactive experience visually in full realtime motion with sounds and possibly with tactile and other forms of feedback’ (Roy, 2003,
p. 177). The more elaborate the quality of the simulation, the more the feeling of immersion
and perception of reality that is experienced by users. This also depends on the level of interactivity, dimensionality, accuracy, fidelity, and sensory input and output (Satava, 1993).
When these features are addressed, simulation can be used as a performance tool to explore
and study specific behaviours and as an educational tool to acquire and practice skills (Axelrod, 1997; Gallagher et al., 2005).
Thus far, successful application of virtual training environments has been shown in studies
addressing fears of heights, flying, spiders, and public speaking. Pertaub, Slater, and Barker
118

5.1. Introduction

119

(2002), for instance, showed significant increased signs of anxiety in people with phobias
when speaking in front of a neutrally behaving virtual audience. By comparing somatic
and cognitive features, including the Personal Report of Confidence as a Public Speaker
(PRCS) as well as heart rate measurements before, during and after the performance, results
suggest that such exposure could be an effective tool for treatment. A follow-up study by
Slater, Pertaub, Barker, and Clark (2006) employed virtual audiences who could respond
neutrally, positively, and negatively. Their verbal responses included expressions such as
‘I see’ or ‘That’s interesting,’ moving to more evaluative statements like ‘That’s absolute
nonsense.’ The audience was also able to provide non-verbal cues such as shifts in facial expression, changes in posture, and short animations including yawning, turning their heads,
or walking out of the room. The results of comparing subjective measurements (e.g., PRCS)
before and after virtual exposure showed that the way the audience responded directly affected participants’ confidence as public speakers, in that positive audience reactions elicited
higher confidence levels while the negative response caused a significant reverse effect.
Virtual environments have also been shown to be an effective tool for training elite performers, such as pilots, athletes, and surgeons, especially when they have relatively little
exposure to real-world performance contexts or when failure carries career- and/or lifethreatening risks. In surgery, for example, such training, compared with more traditional
methods, has been shown to reduce the number of errors in surgical procedures, enhance
the rate and extent of skill acquisition, and improve planning strategies (Grantcharov et al.,
2004). It not only helps trainees who lack experience in real-world surgical contexts but also
advanced surgeons who require exposure to new procedures and technologies (Sutherland
et al., 2006).
Seymour et al. (2002), for example, demonstrated a significant improvement in postgraduate
residents’ psychomotor skills in conducting laparoscopy compared to a control group. The
virtual reality was generated by means of a PC, a video, as well as two laparoscopic interface
input devices. After 10 one-hour training sessions, all participants performed a laparoscopic
cholecystectomy with one of the surgeon-investigators that was blind to the assignment. The
results showed that training in the VR produced fewer errors and a more steady progress

120

Chapter 5. Introducing simulation training

than in the control group. Lendvay et al. (2013) compared the impact of a 3- to 5-minute
warm up using a virtual reality display on the quality of a conventional laparoscopy to a
control group. Evaluated were the task time, the tool path length, the economy of motion,
and the technical and the cognitive errors. In total, four training sessions were carried out,
each 24 hours apart. Advantages of the virtual reality training were found in the path length,
the task time, and the cognitive error (e.g., out of order) after the first three sessions.
To a limited extent, virtual environments have been employed in music, where studies have
tested their use in managing music performance anxiety. To date, the effects of exposure in
these settings on psychological and physiological responses to performance stress are mixed.
On the one hand, exposure to performing conditions using simulation has been shown to
decrease state anxiety significantly compared with a control group, particularly for those
musicians who score higher on trait anxiety measures (Bissonnette, Dube, Provencher, &
Moreno Sala, 2015). On the other, Orman (2003) and Orman (2004) found no discernible,
consistent patterns of change in either self-reported anxiety levels or heart rate for musicians
taking part in an intervention offering graded exposure to stressful performance situations.
Such inconsistent results can also be found in other domains, for instance in studies examining surgical performance by Moktar et al. (2016) and Torkington, Smith, Rees, and Darzi
(2001), who compared simulated training against more conventional training and no training at all. This emphasises the importance of the backgrounds of individual participants,
their levels of immersion (i.e., how realistically they experience the environment), and the
quality of the interface on the overall effectiveness and range of uses of a virtual environment.
In terms of the studies conducted in music, it is possible that the inconsistent findings are
due to differences in the fidelity and interactivity of the simulations used, but in addition,
several methodological limitations should be highlighted in the extant research. Firstly, participants’ use of anxiolytic medication and other substances that may have affected their
perceptions of or physiological response to stress was not controlled. Secondly, while heart
rate was measured in all studies, there were limitations with how the data were reported
(Orman, 2003, 2004), or the results were not reported at all (Bissonnette et al., 2015). Con-

5.1. Introduction

121

cerning the former, stressful events have been shown to influence temporal fluctuations of
the peak-to-peak times in the electrocardiogram (ECG), the R-to-R (R-R) interval, known as
heart rate variability (Berntson & Cacioppo, 2004). While the simplest measures of heart rate
variability are the mean of the R-R time series and the standard deviation about its mean,
both of these statistics are based on the absolute magnitude of the R-R interval. However, in
many applications, relative measures such as the power ratio of the low- and high-frequency
components of heart rate variability allow for more reliable comparisons between participants (Pagani et al., 1986) (for further information, see ‘Data treatment and analysis’ and
Williamon et al. [2013]). Finally, the existing studies test the hypothesis that performance
exposure using virtual environments can ameliorate psychological and physiological symptoms of performance anxiety; while this seems plausible on the surface, the inter- and intraindividual variability in how people experience and interpret such symptoms can be extremely large (Williamon, 2004). Given the multifaceted nature and impact of performance
anxiety on musicians and the personal significance it holds even for highly experienced performers (Kenny, 2011), mere exposure to performance situations can be seen as the first of
many steps in identifying and managing pernicious anxiety-related problems. Rather, it
is possible that anxiety management will be only one of many possible uses of simulation
training for enhancing musicians’ learning and performance.

The aim of our research was to design, test, and explore possible uses of new interactive,
simulated environments that provide salient cues from real-life performance situations—
in this case, a recital and an audition. The environments were designed on the principles
of distributed simulation, in which only a selective abstraction of environmental features are
provided. Distributed simulation has been tested and applied widely in the field of surgical
education, where fully-immersive virtual operating theatres are expensive to build, maintain, and run. The findings suggest that, indeed, a simulated environment only requires
few environmental cues above and beyond the interactive simulation of an injury, wound,
etc. in order to produce significant advancements in learning surgical techniques compared
with more common training methods (Kassab et al., 2011). For instance, these may include a
scaled-down operating lamp, background sounds played through loud speakers, and even

122

Chapter 5. Introducing simulation training

life-sized pictures of machines commonly found in operating theatres; as the surgeons themselves do not operate such equipment and must focus on performing the procedure at hand,
the imitated (yet plausible) environmental features often go unnoticed while adding significantly to the level of immersion experienced by participants. This approach has resulted
in low-cost, convincing simulations that are portable, widely accessible, and can be used
in almost any available space. In our study, advanced violin students performed the same
piece in performance settings that employed a selective abstraction of recital and audition
environments. The musicians’ perceptions and experience of performing in the environments were obtained through questionnaires, and for a subset of participants, ECG data
were recorded during their performances.

5.1.1

Method

Participants
Eleven violinists (6 men, 5 women; mean age=22.45 years, SD=2.25) were recruited for the
study through the Royal College of Music’s (RCM) student email list. They had been playing
the violin for 16.18 years (SD=2.75), including their first performance at age 6.50 (SD=2.20).
All students performed regularly (mean=2.32 times per month, SD=1.30) and practiced on
average for 3.93 hours per day (SD=0.85).
A subset of 7 participants from the larger sample (4 men, 3 women; mean age=22.57 years,
SD=2.50) were selected based on their availability to take part in an additional performance
for a real audition panel. These musicians had been playing for 16.00 years (SD=3.21), with
their first performance at age 7.57 (SD=2.14). They performed for audiences on average 2.00
times per month (SD=1.15) and practiced for 3.89 hours per day (SD=0.93).
This study was granted ethical approval by the Conservatoires UK Research Ethics Committee and was conducted according to ethical guidelines of the British Psychological Society. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and no payment was given in
exchange for participation.

5.1. Introduction

The performance simulator

The performance simulator was developed by the RCM and the Conservatorio della
Svizzera Italiana.1 The aim was to generate back-stage and on-stage environments using
a selective abstraction of key features consistent across a wide range of Western classical
performance venues. The selection of these features was informed by interviews with advanced musicians on their experiences and perceptions of performing and on further pilot
interviewing focused on performance environments. By undertaking user research, interviewing staff and students from the RCM and watching performances from backstage, common features could be identified and then recreated, including interaction with a backstage
manager, the ritual of walking on stage, using appropriate lighting and sound cues (see Figure 5.1), and providing realistic, interactive virtual audiences of different types and sizes.
With these features in mind, the simulator was designed along the principles of distributed
simulation (i.e., low-cost and portable, with high fidelity) to operate in two modes:

• a recital with 24 virtual audience members
• an audition situation with three ‘expert’ virtual judges

In both simulations, pre- and post-performance protocols were employed that matched
those found at leading international performance venues—for instance, entrance to a ‘green
room’ for warm-up, stage calls at regular intervals, and scripted procedures for entering,
bowing, and exiting the stage (see ‘Procedure’).

Recital simulation To create an interactive audience and capture plausible audience behaviours, 11 concert-goers were filmed individually using green-screen technology sitting
still while listening to a Western classical performance (with naturalistic body swaying, fidgeting movements, and coughing) and responding to a successful or unsuccessful performance with a standing ovation, enthusiastic applause, polite applause, or aggressive booing

and displays of displeasure. They performed these tasks on the same approximate timeline, achieved by having them watch a video of an actor mounted next to the video camera
and asking them to synchronise their behaviours with those of the actor. They were filmed
individually so that audiences of different sizes could be compiled. For the purposes of
this study, the audience consisted of 24 people seated in two blocks of chairs situated in a
small auditorium designed using Adobe Illustrator (CS 5) and Photoshop (Figure 5.2). A
Flash interface was created to enable the audience to be manipulated using pre-set control
commands from a computer console located in the backstage area.
In terms of environmental cues, the backstage area was equipped with CCTV footage of
audience members taking their seats in an auditorium (Figure 5.2). On stage, there were
spot-lights and curtains on both sides of the projected audience. Noise distractions such as
coughing, sneezing, and phone ringing were included in the stage area played through loudspeakers. Recordings of these as well as all applause and booing were made separately by
another group of 16 volunteers in an anechoic chamber. Small recital hall reverberation was
added to these recordings and then synchronised and layered on top of the video footage.

Audition simulation The members of the simulated audition panel were three professional actors who were filmed together sitting behind a table. Starting each audition with
a neutral ‘Hello, please start whenever you are ready,’ the panel showed typical evaluative
behaviours such as making notes, looking pensively, and leaning back while simultaneously
portraying positive, neutral, or negative facial expressions and behavioural feedback during
the performance (e.g., smiling or frowning; leaning in toward the performer, or folding arms
and leaning back). Each mode of listening was presented in loops of 5 minutes; the research
team could change the mode of response after the loop or immediately. At the end of the
performance, the audition panel could respond to the performance in a positive, neutral,
or negative fashion—for instance, an enthusiastic ‘Thank you, that was excellent’, a polite
but non-committal ‘Thank you very much’, a disappointed sigh followed by ‘Thank you for

126

Chapter 5. Introducing simulation training

coming’, or a disruptive ‘Thank you, I think we’ve heard enough’ displaying displeasure
and frustration. To enhance the level of interactivity between the panel members, the actors
were filmed together in a small room, and then a virtual audition room with black background was added using Adobe Illustrator (CS 5) and Photoshop (Figure 5.3). Similar to the
recital simulation, a Flash interface was created to enable the panel to be manipulated using
pre-set control commands from a computer console located in the backstage area.
The environmental cues in the audition simulation included CCTV footage displayed backstage of the panel chatting among themselves in hushed voices. On stage, there were spotlights, loudspeakers and curtains on both sides of the projected panel.

Measures

Simulation evaluation questionnaire A simulation evaluation questionnaire was based
closely on work in surgical education by Kassab et al. (2011). It consists of 19 statements
about (1) general perceptions and experience of performing in the simulator, (2) the quality
of the backstage experience, (3) the quality of the onstage experience, and (4) the potential
for using the simulator to develop performance skills. Each statement was rated on a 5point Likert-type scale from 1=’Strongly disagree’ to 5=’Strongly agree’. Table 5.1 shows all
19 statements, as well as descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for each.

State anxiety inventory Immediately prior to each performance, participants were asked
to complete Form Y1 (state anxiety) of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger et al.,
1983: for more details, see Chapters 3 & 4).

Electrocardiogram For the subset of 7 participants, ECG data were collected before and
during performances in the real and simulated auditions using a wireless Zephyr Bioharness
(for more details, see Chapter 4).

Procedure
For each performance, participants were asked to arrive 20-30 minutes before their scheduled performance time. They were shown to a ‘green room’ where they were fitted with the
Bioharness (where applicable, n=7) and allowed to engage in their usual pre-performance
routine (e.g., warming up, practicing, stretching, etc.). Stage calls were given by a member
of the research team—acting as the ‘backstage manager’—at 15 mins and 5 mins before the
performance.
At 0 mins, each violinist was escorted to the backstage area, asked to complete Form Y1 of
the STAI, and required to wait a further 5 mins while the backstage manager carried out
a scripted check that the stage furniture was correctly placed, the auditorium lights were
set, and the audience/audition panel was ready for the performance to begin. During this
time, the backstage area was dimly lit, and the participants had sight of the relevant CCTV
footage and could hear the low murmur of talking from the audience/audition panel. At
the end of these scripted checks, the backstage manager turned to the performer, confirmed
that she was ready to go on stage, opened the stage door for the musician to walk out, and
triggered the applause from the audience (recital) or the greeting from the panel (audition).
While on stage, participants bowed (recital) or returned the greeting (audition) and started
their performance as soon as they felt ready. As this was the first experiment using the
simulator, polite (but neutral) reactions to the performances were set for the virtual audience and audition panel and no deliberate distractions (coughing, sneezing, talking, phone

130

Chapter 5. Introducing simulation training

ringing, etc.) were interjected. Following the end of the performance and shortly into the
audience’s/panel’s response, the stage door opened as a sign to the participant to exit the
stage.
For the subset of 7 participants, an additional real audition was organized, in which the
same procedure was followed. For parity with the simulated audition, three real panel
members (two men, one woman) were shown the footage used in the simulated audition
and instructed to provide the exact same neutral response (physically and orally) to all performances.
Performances for all participants were scheduled at the same time on separate days. The
order of condition (i.e., simulated recital, simulated audition, real audition) was counterbalanced.

Data treatment and analysis

Simulation evaluation questionnaire Initial inspection of data from the simulation evaluation questionnaire revealed that 13 of the 19 questions did not meet the criterion for normality (Shapiro Wilk).2 Therefore, responses to this questionnaire have been analysed using
non-parametric tests (SPSS v19).

Electrocardiogram A key indicator of stress is the temporal fluctuation of the peak-to-peak
times in the ECG—the R-to-R (RR) interval—known as heart rate variability (Berntson et al.,
1997; Berntson & Cacioppo, 2004). This can be studied through time- or frequency-domain
analyses. While the time domain can be characterized through a simple calculation of the
mean R-R or its standard deviation, the frequency domain is studied using power spectral
analysis examining heart rate variability’s low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) components: 0.04 −0.15 Hz and 0.15 −0.4 Hz, respectively (Berntson & Cacioppo, 2004). Here,
the ECG data were analyzed using MATLAB (R2013a).
2 The

Shapiro Wilk test assumes that the data does not show a symmetry of distribution of the data and
includes ‘outliers’ that impact on the results using parametric test statistics (Field, 2008).

Results

Performing in the recital and audition simulations

For insight into participants’ perceptions and experience of performing in the two simulations, the median rating for each item on the simulation evaluation questionnaire was
compared against a hypothesized median of 3, the scale mid-point, using the one sample
Wilcoxon signed-rank test (i.e., the non-parametric equivalent of the one-sample t-test). As
shown in Table 5.1, the medians for all questions were either 3 or above, and the p values
indicate that the medians were significantly higher than 3 for 12 of 19 statements for the
recital simulation (63.2%) and 13 of 19 for the audition simulation (68.4%). With median values significantly higher than 3 on the majority of statements, these results suggest that both
simulations offered a high quality, realistic performance experience, although with some
variation between them.

Focusing more closely on the skill development statements, the participants reported strong
potential for both simulations to be used to enhance their own learning and performance
skills, to manage performance anxiety and/or other performance problems, and to teach
these skills to others. Indeed, 7 of 8 statements for the recital simulation and 8 of 8 for the
audition simulation were significantly greater than 3.

In terms of reported anxiety, participants’ mean state anxiety score for the recital simulation was 35.09 (SD=11.09) and for the audition simulation was 34.09 (SD=7.09). According
to Spielberger et al. (1983), moderate levels of anxiety are represented by scores of 36.47
(SD=10.02) for male students and 38.76 (SD=11.95) for female students. A paired samples
t-test showed no significant difference between state anxiety scores across the two simulations (t(10) =0.33; p>.05), suggesting that the average perceived anxiety before each simulated
performance was comparable.

Chapter 5. Introducing simulation training

Performing in the simulated and real auditions

For the subset of 7 participants, the LF/HF ratio was calculated from the ECG for (1) the
last 5 min of their 20-minute induction session (baseline), (2) 4 min immediately before their
performance for the simulated and real auditions (pre-performance), and (3) their entire
simulated and real auditions (performance). A repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was run with time of measurement (baseline vs. pre-performance vs. performance) and type of audition (simulated vs. real) as within-subjects variables.3 The results
indicate a significant effect of time (F2,12 =21.01; p<.001) and audition (F1,6 =9.94; p<.05) and
a significant interaction between time and audition (F2,12 =8.28; p<.01). Inspection of Figure
5.4 suggests that these significant differences are mostly likely due to the high LF/HF ratio
in the pre-performance period for the real audition. For levels of self-reported anxiety,
participants’ mean state anxiety score for the simulated audition was 32.29 (SD=7.39) and
for the real audition was 37.43 (SD=7.09), suggesting moderate levels of perceived state
anxiety (Spielberger et al., 1983). A paired samples t-test found no significant difference
between state anxiety scores across the two auditions (t(6) =-1.65; p>.05), suggesting that the
average perceived anxiety before each audition was comparable.

Discussion

The aim of this study was to design, test, and explore the possible uses of two new
distributed simulation environments for enhancing musicians’ learning and performance.
These included a small recital and audition setting, both of which offered key visual, auditory, and other environmental cues commonly found backstage and on stage at international
performance venues, as well as scripted protocols for how musicians should be guided
through them. The violinists found the simulations to be realistic and convincing, with all
median ratings for statements in the simulation evaluation questionnaire at the scale midpoint or above (and a majority of statements rated significantly above). In terms of potential
uses of the simulations, the musicians were clear in recognising their positive value for developing performance skills. Moreover, when examining participants’ self-reported anxiety
and physiological responses to performance stress in the simulated audition versus a real
audition, there were no significant differences in state anxiety between the two conditions;
while significant differences emerged in physiological responses for the pre-performance
period, the direction of response (i.e., an increase in the LF/HF ratio) was the same for both,
and there were no apparent differences during the performance. Reasons why the higher
LF/HF ratio in the pre-performance period did not correspond to higher state anxiety scores
could be manifold; musicians may experience the heightened physiological state which accompanies performance as either enabling or debilitating. Nonetheless, in this study comparable psychological and physiological responses were evoked across both auditions, real
and simulated.

The distributed simulations used in this research drew upon a selective abstraction of salient
procedural and environmental features. In both cases, an important element was the ‘backstage manager,’ who guided each musician through the scripted performance process and
served as the gatekeeper for their transitions on and off the stage. The recital simulation
benefitted particularly from the decor of the backstage area, including signage and lighting,
as well as spot-lights in the performance space, while the simulated audition was enhanced

134

Chapter 5. Introducing simulation training

especially by auditory cues played in the backstage area.

Unlike previous research in music (Bissonnette et al., 2015; Orman, 2003, 2004), which focused on exposure to virtual environments as a means of managing performance anxiety,
our results suggest that simulation training may offer wide ranging benefits for musical
learning and performance. While further studies are needed to establish these benefits objectively, feedback elicited as part of the simulation evaluation questionnaire suggests that
the simulations provided a path by which musicians could not only highlight their performance strengths but also address their weaknesses. As such, they were seen as potentially
useful tools for teaching musical skills more efficiently. More generally, this research adds
to the growing literature demonstrating that virtual environments can effectively aid learning, especially as they can be accessed repeatedly and consistently, at controlled levels of
risk and with pre-defined outcomes. The extent to which the effectiveness of the present
simulations will persist through repeated exposure remains to be tested, but findings from
other domains would suggest that the prospects of using virtual environments repeatedly
and longitudinally to enhance learning and performing are indeed promising (Rothbaum,
Hodges, Smith, Lee, & Price, 2000).

Rothbaum et al. (2000) assigned patients suffering from fear of flying to VR, standard treatment, and a wait-list control. The VR was displayed by a head-mounted display with stereo
earphones. Eight group sessions (max. 5 patients) led by a behavioural therapist were conducted, including four sessions of anxiety management training followed by four sessions in
either the VR or the standard treatment scenario. In the VR sessions, patients were asked to
sit in an airplane and experience simulated take-offs as well as landings during either calm
or stormy weather conditions. For the standard treatment, stimuli were presented such as
ticketing, trains, parked planes, and waiting area, including imagined exposure (i.e., imagining take-offs, cruising, landing, etc.). All sessions were conducted within 6 weeks, followed
by a post-test and a follow-up assessment based on standardised questionnaires. Again, the
results demonstrated an equally superior effect of the VR and standard treatment compared
to the control group as well as the maintenance of reduced anxiety after 6 months.

5.2. Discussion

135

Also, Anderson et al. (2013) assigned patients suffering from social anxiety (public speaking) to either a VR or in-vivo exposure. The virtual reality display using a head mounted
display encompassed: (1) a public speech in a virtual conference room; (2) a classroom; and
(3) virtual auditorium. A therapist controlled a variety of different audience responses (e.g.,
interested, bored, supportive, hostile, distracted) and guided the participant through each
step. In the in-vivo exposure therapy patients were asked to give a videotaped presentation
in front of an evaluative audience. A pre-test, post-test and a 12-month follow-up assessment were carried out and after 8 sessions lasting between 20 and 120 minutes, outcomes of
the virtual reality and the in-vivo exposure were equally significantly improved compared
to the control group.

Emmelkamp, Krijn, Hulsbosch, and de Vries (2002), for example, investigated the use of a
VR in treating patients with acrophobia (fear of heights). The authors randomly assigned
patients to either a virtual reality display or in-vivo-exposure, which is a direct confrontation with the feared object. The VR consisted of a low-budget environment, encompassing
a dark room, a railing the user could hold on to, and a visual and auditory display aiming to recreate a feeling of height. After a first familiarization, three gradually increased
anxiety-inducing scenarios were presented: a mall, four floors high; a fire escape up to approximately 50 feet; and a roof garden up to approximately 65 feet. In the in-vivo exposure
the participants were exposed to the same environments. In all scenarios, a behavioural psychologist controlled the setting and guided the participant through each scenario until habituation set in. The results—based on standardised questionnaire measures—demonstrated a
significant, yet equally effective decrease in all measures after both the VR and the in-vivoexposure, with the decreased anxiety remaining up until 6 months. This study has focused
on responses to simulated recital and audition scenarios with relatively neutral and ‘well
behaved’ virtual observers. Subsequent studies should examine the influence of disruptions
and distractions (e.g., coughing, sneezing, phone ringing), as well as more positive and negative observer responses. They should also consider recruiting larger samples of musicians,
who can specifically be studied in low and high anxiety groups. In addition, there is scope
for building and testing further simulated environments: from changing audience size or

136

Chapter 5. Introducing simulation training

modifying the number and type of environmental features to involving more performers or
altering the performance task itself. It would also be instructive to test whether the degree
of background knowledge about the development of the simulations or prior knowledge of
whether the performer will encounter a real or virtual audience before they enter the stage
(i.e., a blind experiment) would impact how musicians perceive and interact with each simulation.
In general terms, one could argue that distributed simulation training, as employed in this
study, has much to offer musicians. However, difficulty arises in mapping out precisely
how to use simulation in ways that are meaningful to those at different levels of skill, with
varying degrees and types of performance exposure, and with very personal experiences of
performance anxiety symptoms. Further experimental work that systematically addresses
these parameters, carried out using psychophysiological and questionnaire-based measures
extended from the current study, could provide such insight.
In this respect, subsequent investigations are needed that explore both generalisable and
individual-specific benefits of simulation training. Research should systematically test the
effects of simulation on skill acquisition, planning and self-regulatory strategies, and techniques for improving communication and presentational skills, alongside interventions for
managing anxiety. It should also investigate how to match certain types, lengths, and intensities of training to individual musicians’ learning and performance objectives. When on
stage, it is precisely these objectives that distinguish one performance from another.

6 | Musicians’ perceptions of using simulation training

6.1

Introduction

Current performance training often strives to deliver a holistic framework that enhances
musicians’ performance confidence1 and creates a positive performance experience (Liertz,
2007). Some of the most innovative approaches directly address aspects such as musicians’ self-efficacy (Bandura & Locke, 2003), stage presence (Davidson, 2012), and an increased sense of control over the performance situation, in particular the employment
of performance facilitating thoughts (Clark, Lisboa, & Williamon, 2014). In order to improve musicians’ performance outcomes and help them manage the challenges of performing, a wide variety of strategies and techniques are now being applied within the musical domain and tested internationally (Kenny, 2011), including cognitive-behavioural interventions and mental skills training and biofeedback (Braden, Osborne, & Wilson, 2015;
Clark & Williamon, 2011; Gruzelier & Egner, 2004; Rodebaugh & Chambless, 2004; Thurber,
Bodenhammer-Davis, Johnson, Chesky, & Chandler, 2010). While there is evidence that
these are effective (Kenny, 2005; Williamon, 2004), they are typically experienced and practiced some distance away from the venues and situations in which performance actually
occurs. To a large degree, effective performance training should allow musicians access
to and experience of performance in the real world (Kassab et al., 2011). Taking this into

to Sander and Sanders (2003), confidence is characterised by ’. . . [a] strong belief, sure expectations [and] having no fear of failure’ (p. 1).

137

138

Chapter 6. Musicians’ perceptions of using simulation training

account, music educators are now beginning to experiment with simulation as a complementary training tool, where virtual reality (VR) components are interwoven alongside key
features of real performance environments so that ‘. . . a person can move around and interact
as if he actually were in this imaginary place’ (Satava, 1993, p. 203).
Simulation training has been applied successfully in a wide range of fields, including (clinical) psychology (Krijn et al., 2004; Safir, Wallach, & Bar-Zvi, 2012), medicine (Selvander
& Asman, 2012) and sport (Zinchenko, Menshikova, Chernorizov, & Voiskounsky, 2011),
addressing anxiety related problems. Across these domains, in particular the relationship
between anxiety and perceptual-motor performance in response to demanding performance
conditions (e.g., critical surgical procedures) has been put under scrutiny. Anxiety can have
detrimental effects on performance execution, attention and decision-making, which is expressed in an increased likelihood to experience and perceive the environment as threatening, to focus on task-irrelevant information (i.e., attentionial bias) and to display threatrelated behaviour that may interfere with the overall performance (outcome: Nieuwenhuys
& Oudejans, 2012). Simulation training offers an evaluation of these effects in a consistent performance setting that is less exposed to situational variability, therefore providing
an ideal tool for educational and interventional assessments (Scalese, Obeso, & Issenberg,
2008).
To put this into context, Emmelkamp et al. (2002) exposed patients suffering from acrophobia either to a simulation (generated by a dark room, a virtual display, and surrounding
audio to create the feeling of height) or to in-vivo-exposure to high places. Self-reports of
anxiety and behavioural avoidance were measured before and after exposure, and compared with the in-vivo-exposure, the results showed a significant decrease in both measures
after simulation training. Simulations have also been used to train elite performers of many
types, from athletes and pilots to surgeons, where there are limited possibilities to train
specific skills in real-life conditions (Kassab et al., 2011; Le, Adatia, & Lam, 2011; Lendvay
et al., 2013). Kassab et al. (2011), for example, demonstrated a significant improvement in
surgeons’ abilities to perform a laparoscopic cholecystectomy using simulation compared
with standard training tools, and they showed that surgeons felt as confident of operating

6.1. Introduction

139

afterwards as if exposed to real scenarios. In their study, they explored the face, content and
construct validity of their newly developed Distributed Simulation (DS). Ten novice as well
as expert surgeons were asked to perform a medical procedure in the simulation and on a
box trainer. While the face and content validity were developed to address the question of
perceived realism and skill demonstration, the construct validity was evaluated by the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS: Undre, Sevdalis, Healey, Darzi,
& Vincent, 2007), which evaluated the behaviour in operating theatre team-members (communication, leadership, monitoring and others within and between nurses, surgeons and
anaesthetists) by means of an external observer. The results showed that both groups perceived the DS as realistic, with experts performed at a higher level of expertise than novices
(i.e., construct validity). The experts had also the feeling that they can behave as if in a
real-life environment, suggesting that the DS is an ideal tool to practice and enhance specific
performance skills.
In music, studies have first tested the use of simulation in managing performance anxiety.
Orman (2003) and Orman (2004) asked eight saxophonists to perform in public (for peers)
and in front of virtual scenarios using a head-mounted display, inducing different degrees
of anxiety such as an empty room versus an audience. Self-reports of anxiety were taken
before, during, and after the performance, while heart rate was monitored throughout. The
results were inconclusive, with no consistent patterns of change in either self-reported anxiety levels or heart rate as a function of exposure to the simulated performance situations. In
another study, Bissonnette et al. (2015) asked seventeen pianists and guitarists to take part
in simulation training that included exposure to a VR display recreating a concert audience
on a large screen and immersive ambient sound and stage lighting. They found a significant
decrease in self-reported state anxiety for high trait anxious female musicians from before to
after the exposure, although no significant decline in state anxiety for men or women with
moderate to low trait anxiety (for more details of each study, see Chapter 5).
More recently, I examined musicians’ ratings of their experiences while performing in simulated recital and audition situations (Williamon et al., 2014: see Chapter 5). I also examined
self-reported state anxiety and heart rate variability in the simulated audition performances

140

Chapter 6. Musicians’ perceptions of using simulation training

compared with corresponding real auditions. The simulations were created in a specially
designed performance space that included abstractions of key features found in recital and
audition environments, such as a waiting area (backstage) with a backstage manager and
CCTV footage and a performance area (on-stage) with a piano, spotlights, and curtains. The
virtual interactive audience and audition panel were programmed to respond positively,
negatively, or neutrally, controlled directly from the backstage area. Overwhelmingly, the
musicians rated both the recital and audition simulations as useful tools for developing and
refining their performance skills. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in state
anxiety or heart rate variability between the simulated auditions and the real auditions,
suggesting that the simulation was able to evoke similar experiences and stress responses
(psychologically and physiologically) as a real performance situation.
Although these studies offer first insight into the uses and utility of simulation training in
the musical domain, a thorough investigation of how musicians experience—or may come
to experience—simulation training has yet to be conducted. Understanding musicians’ experiences in this relatively new field is essential in terms of informing the potential and
effectiveness of simulation for facilitating musical learning and performance. The aim of
this study, therefore, was to understand holistically how musicians’ experience two simulated performances: a recital and an audition. Both have distinctive qualities and are typical
to a musicians’ performing career; while the recital provides a more performer-supported
environment where musicians are likely to receive positive reinforcement at the end of their
playing (i.e., audience applause), auditioning is highly competitive, often with little immediate feedback, and characterised by expectations of the highest quality musical, technical
and sight-reading abilities.
Our overarching research question sought to understand: How do conservatoire students experience simulation training? Informed by the literature, this question comprised two main areas
of enquiry. Firstly, to what extent is simulation training immersive for musicians, as compared with
real-life performances? Studies have shown that the degree of emotional involvement during
simulation training depends on personal expectations and the technology used (Mazuryk &
Gervautz, 1996; Price & Anderson, 2007), and it directly impacts on the degree of ‘presence’

6.1. Introduction

141

(Schubert, Friedmann, & Regenbrecht, 2001), which is the subjective experience of being
in one place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another’ (Witmer &
Singer, 1998, p. 225). In other words, the more immersed students feel during the simulation training, the more likely they are to ‘overlook’ and ‘neglect’ its artificial construct, thus
allowing them to experience simulation training similar to real-life situations. Secondly,
this study set out to understand the characteristics of the musical simulation reported to
facilitate (or not) immersive experience; in other words, to what extent is simulation training
experienced as a tool for improving specific performance skills and tackling performance-related anxiety problems? Thus far, simulation training has been applied in a wide range of domains
to either enhance specific performance skills (Clayton et al., 2013; Kassab et al., 2011) or to
reduce symptoms associated with (performance) anxiety (Bissonnette et al., 2015; Morina,
Brinkman, Hartanto, & Emmelkamp, 2014). Considering research executed in the musical
domain, however, simulation training has only been validated alongside anxiety reducing
protocols (Bissonnette et al., 2015) rather than performance enhancement strategies. With
this in mind, this study set out to examine musicians’ experiences of simulation training as
a tool to enhance performance, reduce performance-related anxiety, or both.

6.1.1

Method

Participants

Nine of eleven undergraduate music students enrolled on an optional performance psychology module at the Royal College of Music agreed to take part in the study. The students
were all women, 21.33 (SD=0.81) years old, and studied the following instruments: clarinet,
oboe, piano, recorder and voice. On average, they first performed at the age of 6.66 years
(SD=1.50), practised 4.50 hours per day (SD=1.18), and performed in public 3.08 (SD=2.01)
times over the month preceding the study. The research was conducted according to ethical
guidelines of the British Psychological Society, and informed consent was obtained from all
participants.

142

Chapter 6. Musicians’ perceptions of using simulation training

Procedure and data collection

Participants were allotted a specific performance time and asked to attend at least 10 min
beforehand for warm-up in a designated space. They were then called to the backstage area
by a backstage manager where they waited quietly for approximately 2 min before receiving the signal to enter the stage area. At that point, they performed a 2-min unaccompanied
piece of their choice in front of either the virtual audience or the virtual audition panel; extended descriptions of each simulation, see Chapter 6. For the audience, a neutral applause
was provided, followed by listening behaviours similar to those of a typical Western classical performance (e.g., naturalistic body swaying and discrete fidgeting and movement). For
the audition panel, a neutral introduction was given (i.e., ‘Hello, please start whenever you
are ready’), followed by typical evaluative behaviours such as making notes and leaning
back while simultaneously portraying a neutral facial expression. After the performance,
the audience applauded politely, while the audition panel gave a polite but noncommittal
‘Thank you very much’. The order of the two performances was counterbalanced, and all
performances were audio and video recorded for the participants’ own use.
Participants were asked to perform a two-minute unaccompanied piece of free choice in the
RCM simulation. Participants performed twice, once in front of the virtual audience and
once in front of the virtual audition panel. For the audience, a neutral applause was provided, followed by listening behaviours similar to those of a typical Western classical performance (e.g., naturalistic body swaying, fidgeting, and movements). For the audition panel
a neutral ‘Hello, please start whenever you are ready’ introduction was given, followed by
typical evaluative behaviour such as making notes, leaning back while simultaneously portraying a neutral facial expression, and behavioural feedback. After the performance, the
audience replied with polite applause, while the audition panel gave a polite but noncommittal ‘Thank you very much’. The order of performances were counterbalanced and audio
and video recorded for the participants’ own use.
After the two performances, qualitative data were collected through (1) a focus group interview and (2) individual written reflective commentaries, both with all nine participants.

6.1. Introduction

143

The focus group was carried out directly after the simulation training in order to capture
student’s spontaneous reflections on their experience, while the commentaries were written
weeks after the simulations to allow for a retrospective reflection. Ideally, such interviews
should be as loosely structured as possible (Krueger & Casey, 2000), and in this study, the
moderator, along with two assistants operating as quiet observers, asked open-ended questions about the musicians’ expectations of using the simulations, their experiences of using
them, suggestions for improvements to the facility and to the procedure, what they learned
from performing in the simulations, and the potential uses of simulation training in music
education (Table 6.1). Participants were encouraged to answer in as much detail as possible,
and the discussion was audio recorded and transcribed by a member of the research team.

In addition, based on their experiences of performing, the musicians were asked to write a
1,500-word reflective commentary as part of their assessment for the undergraduate module. The structure of the commentary was open for the student to determine, but they were
required, as per the module syllabus, to focus on what they expected of the simulation train-

144

Chapter 6. Musicians’ perceptions of using simulation training

ing, their experiences of the two simulations (including how effective they felt it to be as a
performance platform relative to live performance and any differences between playing to a
virtual audience and audition panel), and what they learned from the experience. The musicians gave informed consent for their written course work to be included in the research,
and the research team were not involved in assessing the submissions.

Data analysis

The data of the focus group interview and the reflective commentaries were combined and
analysed using NVivo10 (Onwuegbuzie et al., 2010). The focus group interview data was
transcribed by the first author and the reflective commentaries were closely examined several times by both the first and second author before meaningful phrases, ideas, and concepts were identified and compared between and within participants. These were then labelled and grouped into a series of sub-themes that characterised the musicians’ experiences
of the simulations, clustered together into emergent themes (Bernard & Ryan, 2010; Krueger
& Casey, 2000). Themes and sub-themes were discussed between the first and second author
throughout the data analysis (Clark et al., 2014). In what follows, the main features of each
theme are introduced, supported by indicative evidence from the data and related where
appropriate to existing literature. To assure anonymity, participants are numbered 1-9, and
the source of information (focus group or reflective commentary) is indicated by FG and RC,
respectively. The transcript of the focus group interview is given in the Appendix.

6.1.2

Results and Discussion

Based on the analysis of the focus group interview and the reflective commentaries, four
main themes emerged (see Figure 6.1): (1) the anticipation of using the simulations, including expressions of nervousness and scepticism but also intrigue and hope; (2) the process
of performing in the simulations, such as the transition between the backstage and on-stage
areas, the available auditory and visual cues, the experiences of performing for the audience

6.1. Introduction

145

and audition panel, and the degree of interaction between the performer and the virtual
displays; (3) the usefulness of simulation as a tool for developing music performance skills,
discussing the advantage to have a ‘safe space’ to present and evaluate skills; and (4) ways
of improving simulation training, emphasising the potential for enhancing the current performance procedure and facilities, such as the waiting time in the backstage area and the
performance space on-stage, and using simulation alongside other interventions such as
biofeedback and mental skills training.

The anticipation of using the simulations
The musicians taking part in the study had not previously performed in simulated environments, and anticipation of doing so resulted in four main feelings of anticipation of the first
performance: anxiety, scepticism, curiosity and hope.

Anxiety Similar to a live performance, the musicians experienced feelings of apprehension
prior to entering both simulations.

146

Chapter 6. Musicians’ perceptions of using simulation training
I started experiencing some anxiety a few hours before the first session began.
(RC 3)
I was slightly nervous in anticipation. (RC 1)
It was scarier than I thought it would be. (FG 1)
To my surprise, I felt quite nervous waiting outside of the room. (RC 9)
I thought this simulation was going to be fun. Then I got there, and I got nervous.
(FG 2)

Feelings of anxiety or nervousness are common pre-performance experiences and have been
related to musicians’ personality and past performance experiences (Kenny, 2011). Here,
these feelings appeared to emerge mostly in reference to the novelty of the situation, the
fact that the students did not know what to expect from the simulations, and the impact
of arriving and waiting outside the performance space. Studies have shown that the preperformance period can have a pronounced impact on musicians’ physiological reactivity
to stress (e.g., Abel & Larkin, 1990), and demonstrated that it was the anticipation of performing that caused the highest reactivity among musicians, a finding lent support by the
current study.

Scepticism The musicians also declared feelings of scepticism and doubt about whether
the simulations would be truly immersive and realistic.

Because I knew it was just a simulation, I thought it was not going to feel that
real. So I was a bit unsure. (FG 2)
I was sceptical of the simulator initially and how effective it would be. (RC 4)
I expected it to have less effect on me than it [actually] did. (FG 2)

Similar to the feeling of anxiety, scepticism arises alongside a general reluctance to facing
something unknown (Millar, 2011). The musicians expressed scepticism in terms of the effectiveness of the simulations, in particular how realistic the performance experience would

6.1. Introduction

147

be compared with a real performance and how it might, mentally and physically, affect them
as performers.

Curiosity and hope Curiosity and hope are viewed as positive qualities, characterised by
an eagerness to explore, investigate, and learn something new. Both, furthermore, facilitate
psychological growth, self-discovery, and creativity (Ofer & Durban, 1999). The musicians
were certainly curious and expressed hope about the new experience of performing in the
simulations.
I was curious about what it would entail and how it would work. (RC 5)
I was intrigued as to whether or not I would feel as if I was walking onto a real
stage, and wondered whether I would get nervous at all despite being aware that
it was not a ‘real’ situation. (RC 2)
The musicians expressed curiosity either in terms of the performance environment itself or
the effect that the simulations may elicit. Comparisons were drawn to the musicians’ real
performance experiences, as well as whether they were able to engage fully with the simulations. More specifically, they expressed hope for a tool that could recreate performance
experiences similar to real performance settings.
I was not convinced that the experience would impact me in the same way that
live performances do. Nonetheless, I hoped it would! (RC 5)
I had high hopes for the performance simulator. (RC 3)
The musicians’ comments highlight the desire of having a training tool that has been shown
to be effective in other domains. They demonstrated a general open-mindedness towards
new training approaches, a feature that is crucial to allow an immersive and successful experience in simulation (Murray, Fox, & Pettifer, 2007).
Overall, the anticipation towards using the simulations was expressed by feelings of anxiety,
scepticism, but also curiosity and hope. The way musicians normally await a performance

148

Chapter 6. Musicians’ perceptions of using simulation training

and the subsequent success of that performance typically depends on the employment of
either facilitating or debilitating thoughts (Clark et al., 2014). In this study, the musicians’
expression of emotion varied—perhaps reflecting the novelty of the simulation experience—
but included anxiety similar to that felt in real performances. However, these diverse feelings during the anticipatory period positively changed once the musicians entered the simulated performance space, with their first hands-on experience of what it actually means to
perform in a simulation and in front of virtual displays.

The process of performing in the simulations
The musicians’ experiences of performing in the simulations were categorised according to
the different stages in the performance process, focusing first on the backstage area and then
on the stage area.

Backstage The experience of waiting in the backstage area evoked performance anxiety
symptoms including fidgety behaviour and elevated heart rate.
I was surprised that just seeing the screen with the audition panel in the backstage area was enough to trigger the usual anxiety I get before a performance.
Typically I feel slightly nauseous. . . and start fidgeting or feel shaky. (RC 3)
Before going on stage, [the backstage manager] was whispering to me, and I
thought ‘is this actually a performance?’ [laughter] (FG 4)
I had that backstage feeling. (FG 5)
The backstage feeling was surprisingly real. It was dark, [the backstage manager]
was whispering, and I could hear the audience murmuring and moving. My
heart started pounding. I did not know what lay on the other side of the wall.
(RC 6)
The symptoms described here were primed specifically by the backstage environment, including the inclusion of pre-filmed (fake) CCTV footage of the performance space and back-

6.1. Introduction

149

ground noise such as whispering and murmuring from the audience and audition panel. It
also gave rise to a feeling of uncertainty of what was going on through the stage door. An
increased feeling of realism was added by presence of the backstage manager, who acted out
a scripted role of liaising with the front-of-house and who coordinated the transition from
backstage to the stage area.

On stage Authentic simulations depend on realistic auditory and visual cues to achieve a
feeling of immersion (Morina et al., 2014; Murray et al., 2007). The main points mentioned by
the musicians in this study centred on the spotlights that were directed at them immediately
upon their entrance on to stage.

The spotlight was one of the first elements I noticed, and it surprised me. They
gave me a full feeling of actually being on stage. (RC 1)
To play with this unusual kind of lighting added a bit more pressure to the musical performance in situ, as the whole experience felt a lot more real. (RC 5)
I felt nervous when I saw the spotlights. (FG 2)

The use of spotlights generated a feeling of sudden surprise, an immediate increase of pressure, as well as nervousness. Thus, the musicians appeared to experience feelings similar to
those of a real performance, leading to an increased perception of authenticity.

Interaction with the virtual display In research into virtual reality, the feeling of ‘presence’
(i.e., an increased ability to ‘overlook’ or ‘neglect’ the knowledge of the virtual components)
depends on the graphical reality and interactivity of the technology used, as well as one’s
willingness to engage fully with it (Sas & O’Hare, 2002). Interactivity and related feedback
should be ‘prompt, fluent and synchronised’ and, ideally, highly synchronised within and
between different modalities (Mazuryk & Gervautz, 1996, p. 18). The musicians focused
particularly on their interaction with the virtual displays and the human-like appearance
and behaviour of the audience and audition panel.

150

Chapter 6. Musicians’ perceptions of using simulation training
I wasn’t really expecting that kind of real situation. . . You know, with [the audience] actually moving. . . it made me feel more like they were human even though
they were not. (RC 9)
With the audition panel, I felt connected. They spoke to me, and I felt like I
should speak back. (FG 3)
The fact that the audition panel was interactive made the first session very genuine. (RC 5)

It seems that the musicians were not expecting the virtual display to interact with them
before, during or after their performance and that even basic interactions between performer
and the virtual displays enhanced the reality of the simulations.
According to the wider literature on simulation, adequate sensory feedback should consider
the relevance of the sensations of vision, audition, touch, smell and taste (Downtown &
Leedham, 1991); in addition, the virtual reality components should be synchronised and
exhibit marginal latency effects with the user’s behaviour (Sherman & Craig, 2003). As
in this study, simulation designs in other fields have also been able to provide these cues
effectively, without the need for elaborate motion tracking systems (Mazuryk & Gervautz,
1996).

Usefulness of simulation as a tool for developing music performance skills

The musicians identified one prevailing way in which the simulations were directly useful to
their own practice: the generation of a safe environment to train and to practise performing.

Safe environment Simulated performance spaces have been classified as ‘safe’
environments—that is, they are potentially less harmful than in-vivo desensitization exposure, while offering a more tangible and real approach than cognitive therapies using imaginal desensitization (North, North, & Coble, 1997). The musicians in this study confirmed
that the simulator was a relatively safe space in which to practice performance.

6.1. Introduction

151

The simulator could potentially serve as a platform that provides the necessary
safe space to acquire performance skills through trial and error. (RC 9)
[It is a] safe environment knowing that no one is there. (FG 4)
Waiting for an exam where one will be judged and criticized is much less often
experienced than the hours spent in the practice room and is, therefore, more
likely to throw one off balance before a performance. This is where simulation
can help overcome this fear, by repeated exposure in a safe and controlled environment. (RC 8)

Students emphasized this benefit in terms of having a space in which the fear of failure is
reduced through the elimination of negative appraisal that may come from real audiences
and evaluators. Additionally, the simulations allowed for experimentation and skill development through a process of trial and error iteration. The musicians also acknowledged
the possibility of using repeated exposure to overcome problems such as performance anxiety and to prepare them physically and mentally for real performance experiences, be they
positive or negative.
Reflection on performance is an indispensable part of performance enhancement (MacNamara, Button, & Collins, 2010). Rather than a standard practice room and a distressing real
stage, simulation training provides a halfway approach that comes closer to real performance than the former and is more accessible and less risky than the latter. Performance
training where musicians are encouraged to behave as they would in a real performance setting offers greater scope to build upon strengths and to address weaknesses in performance,
such as improving stage presence without having to suffer career threatening failures or
other negative consequences.

Ways of improving simulation training

The final theme stresses the potential that the musicians identified to enhance the simulations, focusing on the procedure and facility, as well as the prospects for simulation training

152

Chapter 6. Musicians’ perceptions of using simulation training

to improve music education more generally.

Procedure and facility The importance of sensory feedback in simulations to create an
authentic performance experience has been addressed extensively (Sherman & Craig, 2003).
Less, however, has been written on how the simulation facility (e.g., the room and furniture)
and the procedures by which simulations are accessed can be tailored to the specific field
of use. In this study, the musicians pointed to the need for a longer waiting time in the
backstage area and a more spacious performance area on stage.

I felt there needed to be longer wait before the performance to replicate real life.
(RC 9)
Increase the time spent in the backstage area. Personally, I find that the longer I
have to wait, the more nervous I get. (RC 7)
Sometimes you have to wait around a while before you go on, and this time, for
me it was quick. (FG 3)
The bit where I get nervous is when I have to wait. (FG 5)

The points raised draw attention to the disparity between the musicians’ experiences of real
performances and those in the simulations, notably with regard to the amount of time spent
waiting in the backstage area (i.e., in this study, just 2 mins). Another point was the small
size of the room in which the simulations are currently housed:

The lack of space in the room did not pose any problems during the audition
simulation, since auditions are held in a variety of venues. However, this had a
large impact on my experience of the recital simulation. (RC 4)
I would make sure that the size of room used is a larger performance space. (RC
6)
It would be useful if the room was bigger because. . . we do not perform in little
spaces. When the stage is bigger, you feel exposed. (FG 2)

6.1. Introduction

153

The restricted stage area was noticed particularly in the recital simulation, which in a real
performance setting would be more spacious than in the simulation space. This was not,
however, a problem for the performances in the audition simulation, as auditions can occur
in smaller rooms.

Intervention Finally, the participants highlighted the potential for the simulations to be
used as a form of intervention, to help musicians overcome challenges and manage anxieties
that can impair performance quality.

It would be interesting to see which thoughts and emotions would keep, for instance, our heart rate at a slower level. Maybe then we musicians could finally
train ourselves to be fully prepared for performance. (RC 3)
As an example, it would be very useful to perform in the simulations with a
particularly distracting and difficult virtual audience to prepare us for all eventualities that may occur in a performance. (RC 2)
I think ‘okay, I can do that’, and then if something happens in a real life situation
when I might not expect it. . . it’s fine because I have experienced it before. It’s
about having the right mental state. (FG 5)

The musicians’ suggested the use of training emotional regulation by means of a gradual increase of distraction caused by the virtual display. In addition, they suggested that simulation training could be usefully paired with other performance enhancement interventions in
order to optimise physical and mental responses to performance situations. Indeed, research
has shown that interventions such as biofeedback and mental skills training can directly improve performance quality and anxiety management skills (Arora et al., 2011; Gruzelier &
Egner, 2004; Thurber et al., 2010). For instance, recent studies that addressed the efficacy
of mental reparation in the musical domain stems from Highben and Palmer (2004). They
asked sixteen pianists to mentally rehearse four novel 20-minute pieces over ten practice trials. The practice trials included: (1) normal practice; (2) practice without auditory feedback

154

Chapter 6. Musicians’ perceptions of using simulation training

(sound turned off but still pressing the keys); (3) practice without motor feedback (not pressing the keys but hearing a recording of the piece); and (4) mental practice in the absence of
auditory and mental feedback. Results showed that the removal of any feedback lowered
learning and memory abilities, and that normal practice provided the most efficient performance outcome. In addition, pianists who possessed greater aural skills were less affected
by the missing feedback during practice than those without. However, due to the cost of
accessing real concert halls, these techniques are often applied away from the contexts in
which performances take place. Simulation opens entirely new modes of delivery for such
interventions, allowing researchers and practitioners to put them to the test by applying
them in the situations where they are most needed.

6.2

General Discussion

In respect to the study’s research question and areas of enquiry, the results demonstrate that:
(1) while students’ level of immersion in simulation training differed, context and environment contributed to an immersive experience, enhanced through the use of key auditory
and visual cues such as background noise and spotlights, as well as the degree of interaction
with the virtual displays; (2) the musicians acknowledged the safety available in simulation
training and its potential for developing, experimenting with and enhancing a wide range
of performance skills, rather than reducing performance-related anxiety.
Effective simulations should provide adequate sensory feedback and graphical reality which
should both be displayed precisely and with low time latency (Mazuryk & Gervautz, 1996).
The simulation training in this study was able to present realistic visual and auditory feedback to an extent that allowed the majority of students to experience some feeling of immersion. Immersion experiences in this study were enhanced by auditory and visual cues
(background noise and spotlights), and the interaction with the virtual audience and audition panel as well as a combination of high-resolution human computer interface and
prompt and fluent feedback, synchronised within and between different modalities (e.g.,

6.2. General Discussion

155

visual and auditory feedback).
The musicians’ preference to use simulation training to enhance specific performance skills,
rather than to reduce performance anxiety, is a new finding not previously observed in studies using simulation (Bissonnette et al., 2015; Orman, 2003, 2004). While the training may
indeed be able to reduce performance anxiety, the results of this study expand the potential
of simulation training as a tool to acquire and practice specific performance skills, providing
more options for optimising preparation for (high-pressure) performances of all types. Future studies are therefore encouraged to elaborate on these findings by considering exactly
how simulation training may be employed for the development of widely defined musical,
technical and communicative performance skills.
This study offers implications for practice, identifying several areas in which student experience can be enhanced and therefore the effectiveness of simulation training improved. The
results provide evidence that students experience simulation training as an opportunity to
strengthen positive attitudes towards the preparation, delivery and review of performance,
reporting an interest in simulation training as an intervention to facilitate a deeper awareness of the physical and psychological processes underpinning successful performances. To
this end, simulation training may be provided alongside real-life feedback of musicians’
physical and psychological responses (e.g., heart rate, breathing, state anxiety) before, during and after their performances in order to facilitate increased performance awareness
while practising performing in a relatively safe and low-exposure performance environment. Similarly, students emphasised using simulation training in combination with mental
preparation strategies. Indeed, recent research has shown that elite musicians under highstress performance scenarios particularly focus on positive thinking and self-talk in order to
build up sufficient performance confidence (Buma, Bakker, & Oudejans, 2015). This was, for
instance, shown by Buma et al. (2015), who conducted systematic research in oder to understand the attention needed when performing under high-pressure performance situations.
To find out more about how and to what extent to what musicians’ employ performance
coping strategies, they asked elite musicians to provide a report on what they focus on an
think about during moments of pressure. Through the application of retrospective methods

156

Chapter 6. Musicians’ perceptions of using simulation training

such as concept mapping and verbal reports, the authors alongside seven expert teachers
generated a cluster analysis. The results lead to six clusters of which three clusters, namely
‘focus on physical aspects,’ ‘thoughts that give confidence,’ and ‘music-related focus’ accounted for 85.2% of the 190 statements created and drawn from the verbal reports. The
authors conclude that in order to develop and maintain a high quality performance under
pressure, musicians focused on aspects such as music-related information, physical features
and thoughts that would provide them with some sort of performance confidence.
During mental rehearsal, musicians are encouraged to apply aural, visual, and kinaesthetic
visualisation, as well as cognitive and motivational strategies (emotional regulation) that are
believed to lead to a performance sensation similar to a real (and ideal) performance (Connolly & Williamon, 2004). The benefits of mental skills training was, for instance, shown by
Bernardi, Schoris, Jabusch, Colombo, and Altenmüller (2013), who assessed mental practice
and musicians’ progress on music memorisation using mental practice strategies of individually preference. Sixteen pianists were asked to memorise two pieces by applying either
physical practice or mental practice. Performances were evaluated in terms of correctness of
notes, articulation and phrasing, dynamics and expressions, and via a global performance
quality score. Results showed an improved musical learning using mental practice as well
as mental practice alongside physical practice, which was also supported by the external
performance quality ratings.
Future work should, therefore, address these points by developing new protocols for mental
rehearsal that make use of performance simulation in order for musicians to experience and
experiment with their ‘optimal zone of functioning’ (Hanin, 2003).
This study is not without limitations. Firstly, only women that were enrolled in an optional performance psychology module took part. This means that no information of the
experience of simulation training for men was gathered and that students may have been
motivated to test different solutions that might help improving their performance, which,
in turn, may have increased the risk of a sampling-bias. Still, the study is the first detailed
analysis of simulation experience in the musical domain, and in this respect, no predicted

6.2. General Discussion

157

differences in the quality of experience between men and women can be gleaned from the
extant literature. Furthermore, students were encouraged to critically evaluate both advantages and disadvantages of their experience using simulation training. This was hoped to
not only prevent sampling-bias but also to reduce the influence of the order of interview and
reflective commentaries, respectively.
Secondly, the feedback provided by the virtual displays was of a neutral nature. This was
to avoid a first experience of simulation that was overshadowed by particularly positive or
negative responses from the virtual audience and audition panel. Subsequent studies should
employ the full range of interactive potential of these simulations: for instance, distracting
coughing, sneezing, phone ringing in the audience, and different degrees and intensities of
feedback as shown through applause, facial expressions and gestures of different valence.
Nonetheless, given the multifaceted nature and impact of performance experiences on musicians and the personal significance it holds even for highly experienced performers, simulation training can be seen as the first of many steps in identifying, training and improving
performance-related skills.

Introduction

Performing in public should be enjoyable and create a sense of accomplishment (Clark et al.,
2014). The performer should furthermore be performer high in self-efficacy, leading to an
increased control over the performance situation.1 Both self-efficacy and the perception of
an increased control over the performance situation are reinforced through positive learning
and feedback experience, allowing the person in charge to respond to performance stress in
a physical and mental flexible manner.
A close examination between the link between cardiovascular and pulmonary stress responses and stimuli of different valence has been shown in studies exposing participants
to material such as affective film sequences, pictures (Ritz, Thöns, Fahrenkrug, & Dahme,
2005), or music. Pu, Schmeichel, and Demaree (2010), for instance, asked 136 participants
1 The

term self-efficacy was first defined by (Bandura, 1993) in the early nineties, who states that ‘. . . people
make causal contribution to their own functioning through mechanisms of personal agency. Among the mechanisms of personal agency, none is more central or pervasive than people’s beliefs about their capabilities to
exercise [. . . ] to have control over their own level of functioning and over events that affect their lives’ (p.
118). As such, a growth in self-efficacy enables an increased ability cognitive, affective, and motivational and
selection processes, allowing for a gain in the likelihood (and the belief) to achieve a specific goal. Indeed,
the experience of performance stress is greatly linked with self-efficacy and the ability to cope with a distressing situation. Self-efficacy is defined as a multifaceted set of believes in the capability to achieve a goal
successfully (Bandura & Locke, 2003) and is substantial when coping with daily hassles; it is about the effort of
solving a problem or facing negative experiences and includes cognitive, affective, and motivational processes.
These processes are, moreover, affected by: (1) past experiences; (2) the comparison between oneself and an
ideal self; (3) coping behaviour; or (4) the feedback—all of them shaping one’s efforts for short or long-term
achievements.

to watch a negative and a neutral film sequence, while resting respiration was monitored 2
minutes before each stimulus. Additionally, they carried out a verbal and spatial memory
task after. Results showed a direct link between the resting respiration, the negative stimuli
and a temporarily decreased inhibition of participants’ spatial working memory, whilst no
such patterns were observed for the neutral stimulus. Frazier, Strauss, and Steinhauer (2004)
exposed 56 participants to nine film clips (3 neutral, 3 positive and 3 negative) while measuring participants respiration pattern and heart rate variability. Results revealed a decreased
respiration and heart rate variability during both positive and negative stimuli, suggesting
that both emotions trigger a similar physiological arousal that can not necessarily be separated by the valence. In contrast, Demaree, Robinson, Everhart, and Schmeichel (2004)
randomly assigned 111 to watch either a positive or negative film sequences and monitored
participants’ respiration and changes in facial expressivity. The results revealed a greater facial expressivity and a lower resting respiration when the negative film stimulus presented.
In terms of the frequency distribution of the R-R fluctuations, the majority of studies showed
an increased LF power and LF/HF ratio for anxiety, while positive emotions, such as contentment or visual anticipatory pleasure led to an increased TI and TE and observable in a
slower breathing. By contrast, negative emotions, such as anger or fear resulted in an increased breathing frequency and an increased TI /TTOT (for a detailed review, see Chapter
2).

In the musical domain, changes in heart rate variability and breathing due to positive versus negative feedback is sparse. Müller and Lindenberger (2011) monitored eleven singers’
ECG and respiration during a performance and a baseline measurement. The performance
revealed a greater synchronisation of spectral power density between heart rate variability
and respiration compared to a baseline measurement, yet no indication of their emotional
state was provided. Studer et al. (2012) assessed features of the respiration (TI , TE , TTOT ,
TI /TTOT ) and heart rate variability prior to a private and a public concert. Results showed
an increase in heart rate variability, TE , TTOT and TI /TTOT during the high-stress condition,
which has also been shown to increase their degree of anxiety. Lastly, De Manzano, Theorell, Harmat, and Ullen (2010) examined the degree of musicians’ flow and physiological

160

Chapter 7. Changes in heart rate variability before and during simulation training

reactions, revealing a positive correlation between flow and increased respiratory depth, yet
a reduction in respiration and a decreased heart rate period. Overall, although these studies confirm altered physiological and emotional responses due to a changed performance
context, they: (1) do not consider psychophysiological assessments due evaluative performance contexts of opposite emotional valence under a (2) controlled performance setting.
To adequately assess individual differences in physiological response style, it is of benefit to
provide a constant exposure of either positive or negative stimuli.
The overarching aim of this study is therefore to evaluate the impact of simulation-based performance feedback on cardiovascular signatures of stress responses and self-reported anxiety
(for more on simulation training and cardiovascular stress responses, see Chapters 2 & 5).
To this end, I conducted a close examination of the relationship between stress and structural complexity of heart rate variability in response to two conditions to which the musicians were exposed: in front of three simulated ‘judges’ providing (1) positive facial and
behavioural feedback, and (2) negative facial and behavioural feedback. This was achieved
by a conjoint psychological and physiological examination of stress responses within the
domain of complexity science (for more details, see Chapter 2).

7.1.1

Method

Participants

Twelve violin students from the Royal College of Music (3 men, 9 women; mean age=21.54
years; SD=2.20) were recruited by email. On average, they first performed at the age of
7.18 years (SD=1.82), practised 3.04 hours per day (SD=1.88), and performed in public 1.54
(SD=1.75) times over the month preceding the study.
Participants were informed that they would be required to give multiple, polished performances of the ‘Allemande’ from J. S. Bach’s Partita No. 2 in D minor for solo violin (BWV
1004). This study was granted ethical approval by the Conservatoires UK Research Ethics
Committee and was conducted according to ethical guidelines of the British Psychological

7.1. Introduction

161

Society. Informed consent was obtained from all participants and no payment was given in
exchange for participation.

Measures

The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, state form (STAI-Y1) Prior to and after each performance, participants completed Form Y1 (state anxiety) of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory
(STAI: Spielberger et al., 1983), a 20-item questionnaire measuring the emotional state of the
person at the time of completion based on subjective feelings of nervousness and perceived
activation and arousal (for more details, see Chapters 2 & 3).

Electrocardiographic ECG was recorded using a wireless commercial device, the Zephyr
Bioharness (for more details, see Chapter 2).

Procedure

Each participant attended a 30-minute rehearsal session during which they completed the
background questionnaires, got familiarised with the BioHarness and introduced to the concept of the simulation. On explicit questioning, all participants confirmed that they were not
currently taking anxiolytic medication or other substances that may affect their perceptions
of or alter any physiological responses to performing. The performance in the simulation
was scheduled according to the students’ availability.

Design For the performance in front of the positively and negatively behaving virtual audition panel, students were asked to arrive 10 minutes before the scheduled performance in
order to get fitted with the device and to engage with their pre-performance practice habits
(e.g., stretching, warm up, practising, etc.). Stage calls were given by a member of the research team—acting as the backstage manager—5 minutes before their performance in front
of a virtual audition panel. When the performer entered the stage, a neutral ‘Hello, please

162

Chapter 7. Changes in heart rate variability before and during simulation training

start whenever you are ready’-introduction was provided followed by an either positive or
negative behaviour, such as making notes, leaning back while simultaneously portraying
positive or negative facial expressions and behavioural feedback, respectively. After the
performance, the audition panel gave either an enthusiastic and encouraging ‘Thank you,
this was excellent’ or a brief and disappointed ‘Thank you for coming’. heart rate variability was monitored throughout, including a 5-minute pre-performance period. The STAI-Y1
was completed prior to and immediately after each performance. The performances were
counterbalanced and audio and video recorded.

Data treatment Data treatment and analysis was undertaken using MATLAB (R2013a) and
SPSS v21. For the ECG, R-R intervals were detected using cublc spline interpolation and median filter with samples at regular time intervals of 0.25s (for more information, see Chapter 4). All features fulfilled normal distribution and were assessed using a repeated measures ANOVA with Greenhouse Geisser Correction, investigating the effect produced by
time (pre-performance, performance, after performance) and feedback condition (positive
versus negative), as well as their interaction (for more details on the statistics, see Chapter
3).

7.1.2

Results

State anxiety There were no effects of time or feedback condition, nor a significant interaction between them. On average, students’ state anxiety decreased from 34.75 (SD=11.58)
before to 28.75 (SD=7.07) after the positive feedback, and from 30.75 (SD=8.04) to 29.42
(SD=7.59) after the negative feedback. Although not significant, a greater degree of anxiety reduction was observed for the time after the positive (mean difference=6.00, SD=4.51)
compared to the negative feedback (mean difference=1.03, SD=0.45).

Heart rate variability LF power, which is generally associated with SNS activity and the
baroreceptor reflex, showed a significant effect of time (F1,11 =38.356; p<.001; ηp2 =.77), but

7.1. Introduction

163

no effect of condition or interaction between time and condition. Figure 7.1a shows LF
before and during the positive and negative feedback condition. The LF increased from preperformance to the performance period in both the positive and negative feedback condition. The greatest LF activity was detected during the performance in the negative feedback
condition.
HF power, generally associated with PNS activity and the respiratory sinus arrhythmia,
showed a significant effect of time (F1,11 =40.152; p<.001; ηp2 =.78), but no effect of condition or interaction between time and condition. As shown in Figure 7.1b, the HF increased
from pre-performance to the performance period in both the positive and negative feedback
condition.
The LF/HF ratio, which is an indication of the sympatho-vagal balance with higher ratios suggesting higher overall stress levels, showed a significant effect of time (F1,11 =10.793;
p<.001; ηp2 =.49), but no effect of condition or interaction between time and condition. Figure
7.1c shows an increase in LF/HF ratio in the pre-performance period for both the positive
and negative feedback condition. The lowest LF/HF ratio was observed during the performance in the positive feedback condition, suggesting a lower sympatho-vagal tone—and,
thus, more relaxed physical state—during the performance in front of the positively behaving audition panel (Table 7.1).

Discussion

Auditioning is at the very core of a musical profession, yet little is known about the cardiovascular demands of these performance scenarios. The overarching aim of this study
is therefore to establish a relation between the dynamics and timing of physiological stress
reactivity in response to a positive and negative performance feedback. In particular, this
study explored the impact of simulated training on musicians’ heart rate variability and
state anxiety. Twelve musicians performed twice in a simulation consisting of an interactive virtual element supported by real environmental cues: once in front of three ‘judges’
providing positive facial and behavioural feedback and once displaying negative facial and
behavioural feedback. The heart rate variability was monitored throughout the performance
including a 5-minute pre-performance period while reports anxiety were completed before
and after. Four quantitative metrics using power spectral density (PSD) and novel multiscale sample entropy (MSE) techniques were used to estimate stress levels: LF, HF, LF/HF
ratio and multiscale sample entropy.

Overall the results show that all metrics indicate a higher physiological stress level in musicians during the pre-performance period compared with during the performance, and that
the performance was not affected by the feedback provided. While the LF power (associated with the SNS) increased from pre-performance to the performance period in both
performances, the most increased LF activity was detected for the negative feedback condition. The HF power, which is associated with the parasympathetic nervous system and
believed to represent a physically relaxed state, also increased from the pre-performance
period to the performance period in both conditions, yet did not show any distinctive differences between positive and negative feedback. The LF/HF ratio decreased from the preperformance to the performances in both negative and positive condition and was lowest
during the performance in the positive feedback condition. The MSE result showed lowest
complexity during the pre-performance period; in other words, the low structural indicate
stress as an inhibition (fewer degrees of freedom), whose excessive levels may harm the

performance and/or performers (Williamon et al., 2014).

Limitations This study did not assess other psychological features—apart from state
anxiety—that may have been mediated for the changes in the cardiovascular stress features.
Future studies may therefore assess state anxiety in a larger sample and alongside other
measures, such as self-efficacy, performance confidence or the ability to cope with stress.
Performance confidence is strongly linked with past experiences and performance outcomes
(Bong & Skaalvik, 2003) and is defined by the ability to monitor, reflect and understand the
relationship between performance feedback and musicians’ attitude towards performance.
Through the usage of simulation training to increase performance confidence, Tuggy (1998),
for instance, demonstrated simulated training to significantly improve medical students’
perceived confidence and abilities to perform a sigmoidoscopy when compared with a control group, and a strong agreement in gained confidence for live patient examination. Other
studies, such as Jude, Gilbert, and Magrane (2006) showed that over 85% of the students reported higher levels of confidence in their abilities of performing such medical procedures
after completing simulation training. More recently, Clayton et al. (2013) explored the feasibility and effect simulated training on doctors’ confidence, communication skills, attitudes
towards psychosocial care and burnout. The intervention involved three one-hour teaching
sessions over three weeks, including written and audio-visual take-home learning material.
The results showed significantly higher self-reported communication skills, confidence in
delivering relevant topics, a greater attitude towards psychosocial care and an increased
sense of personal accomplishment.
Thus far, in the musical domain, simulated training has mainly been applied to reduce
physical and mental performance stress. However, at best, simulation training should be
integrated into the curriculum and assisted by appropriate feedback in order to ensure an
effective outcome. Indeed, the type of feedback is one of the most important features toward
effective learning. Studies may therefore examine the application of simulation training as a
reward system in order to build up performance confidence and to decrease dysfunctional

anxiety and avoidance behaviour (Lyon, 2012).
Performance stress is a (psychological and physiological) multi-level process and closely
tied to the performance situation (Kellmann, 2002). A commonly employed paradigm to
assess the link between these two is the division of stress responses into stress reactivity and
recovery. While stress reactivity is the time of the heart rate baseline to the peak, recovery
is the time needed to return back to baseline. Unfortunately, in this study, I only investigated heart rate reactivity and not recovery. Heart rate recovery is an important feature of
stress and has been evaluated in well-established ‘stress-assessments’, such as the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST: Frisch, Hausser, & Mojzisch, 2015; Kirschbaum, Pirke, & Hellhammer,
1993). The TSST is a 15-minute social evaluate performance scenario, in which participants
are asked to prepare a convincing speech to get their dream job (5 minutes), to give a presentation in front of an interview panel as to why they are the right candidate for this position
(5 minutes), and to solve a mental arithmetic task by subtracting an odd two-digit number
from a four-digit number (5 minutes). The TSST has provided stupendous evidence of its reliability, in particular for the evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress
axis, responsible for the neuroendocrine system and regulating body processes, such as the
immune system and energy storage. Other studies used the TSST to assess changes in the
balance of the autonomic nervous system, and observed a significant increase in heart rate,
and a higher self-reported stress and anxiety (Hellhammer & Schubert, 2012).
The TSST has also been used as flexible and adaptable tool for specific research foci, and
therefore paving the way for a huge variety in research applications (Frisch et al., 2015).
For instance, the TSST has also been validated as part of simulation training, showing that
the TSST was able to significantly increase cortisol levels, heart rate and state anxiety compared to participants’ baseline measures (relaxed sitting: Montero-Lopez et al., 2016). The
simulation in this study offers a similar concept and allows a performer to experience a preperformance, a performance and a post-performance period. Future studies should therefore consider the aspect of the stress recovery and evaluate its extent in music performance
simulation.

8 | Conclusion

8.1

Summary of findings

Stress is an unavoidable part of musical performance, yet its equivocal nature means that
it can be seen both as an important facilitator and inhibitor to performance quality. Analysis of stress in music performance also generalises to other aspects of life, yet despite the
importance of stress research, studies on objective stress assessment in rigorous controlled
performance settings are few and far between. To fill this void, this thesis set out to provide a thorough picture of the physical stress experienced in different performance contexts
by applying different methodological approaches to understand and interpret performance
stress. In addition, this thesis evaluated alternative methods—simulation training—to help
musicians achieve greater performance experiences, but also to bridge the gap between lowstress and high-stress performances.
In studies 1 and 2 (Chapters 3 & 4), I examined the physiological responses to low- and
high-stress performance situations before and during the performance from the perspective
of a case study and a group of music students. The results showed that, while standard and
state-of-the-art methods (discussed in Chapter 2) to analyse physiological data are complementary, multiscale sample entropy provides greater insight into the degree of physiological
change experienced by musicians when performing under stress in public, and the evolution of stress levels is also consistent with the difficulty of the music being played. For the
frequency domain analysis, in both studies, between performance conditions the HF power
was as expected higher for the low-stress condition, suggesting an increased PNS activity

and more physical relaxed state. Conversely, the LF power, which is believed to reflect the
SNS activity and to be elevated during stress, increased in the high-stress and decreased in
the low-stress condition. While this result does not confirm the commonly believed relationship between the LF power and the SNS in response to stress, is in agreement with more
recent studies that postulate that the LF power does not accurately reflect the SNS activity
(Billman, 2011). Moreover, the results provide conclusive evidence that higher stress levels
in musicians are elicited in the pre-performance period compared with the time during the
performance, in particular for the high-stress condition. These findings also corresponded
with higher levels of self-reported state anxiety by the musicians.
In studies 3 to 5 (Chapters 5, 6 & 7), I introduced a new approach to managing performance stress and enhance performance preparation. For this, I co-developed a simulated
performance space based at the Centre for Performance Science, Royal College of Music.
The simulated performance space is a training tool that combines a virtual reality display
with key features of a real environment (i.e., ‘distributed simulation’). The aim of this research was to design and test the efficacy of simulated performance environments in which
conditions of ‘real’ performance could be recreated. Students were recruited to perform in
the simulation, to complete questionnaires on their experiences of using the simulation, to
provide written reflective commentaries on their experience using the simulation and to attend to a focus group interview to share their personal thoughts and perceptions on how
simulation training for musicians could be developed further. In addition, I evaluated the
simulation’s face validity by monitoring musicians’ heart rate variability and state anxiety
and by comparing these against musicians’ physiological and psychological experiences in
a real-life performance scenario.
Overall, the results show that simulations offer a realistic performance experience and that
the training is perceived as particularly useful for developing and strengthening performance skills. Furthermore, I found comparable levels of reported state anxiety and patterns
of heart rate variability in both simulated and real performance situations, suggesting that
responses to the simulated audition closely approximated those of the real audition. Simulation training caused an increased level of physical arousal during the pre-performance

period, while responses during the performance were unaffected by the valence of the ‘virtual’ feedback musicians’ received after the performance. A thematic analysis of the qualitative data highlighted the musicians’ experiences in terms of (1) their anticipation of using
the simulations, (2) the process of performing in the simulations, (3) the usefulness of simulation as a tool for developing performance skills and (4) ways of improving simulation
training. The results show that, while simulation was new to the musicians and individual
levels of immersion differed, they saw benefits in the approach for developing, experimenting with and enhancing their performance skills. Specifically, the musicians emphasised
the importance of framing the simulation experience with plausible procedures leading to
and following on from the performance, and they recognised the potential for combining
simulation with complementary training techniques.

Contribution of findings in relation to the literature review

Studies 1 and 2 were done in consideration that (1) wearable sensing technologies have only
just generated commercial products suitable for the monitoring of musicians during performance (unobtrusive, ergonomic, discreet) but this convenience is typically compromised by
lower signal quality; (2) movement of musicians during performance (often abrupt) introduces a number of electromagnetic and muscular artifacts in ECG which need to be dealt
with using techniques that are beyond standard digital filters; (3) an optimal R-peak detection within ECG in such conditions requires person-specific thresholds in data analysis,
together with advanced signal processing algorithms for the detection of R-peaks and removal of artifacts; and (4) stress is a complex multi-layered phenomenon and its in-depth
analysis may require non-standard methods, since the currently used spectral analyses of
the heart rate variability have been shown to be inconsistent.
The well-documented lack of suitable data acquisition devices (robust to musicians’ movement and motion artifacts, unobtrusive, discreet, comfortable) and shortage signal process-

8.2. Contribution of findings in relation to the literature review

171

ing algorithms for real-world wearable application have so far been prohibitive to largerscale studies of stress experience in human performance. In this thesis, new wearable physiological recording devices were employed, and I have addressed the imperfections and
artifacts in such real-world data through advanced data analysis methods. I focused on
combining physiological and psychological measures, analysed within the framework of
complexity loss theory, which allowed me to analyse data from a number of performers
(Chapter 4) and to extend the current single-person analysis (Chapter 3) to address a more
general issue of musicians’ emotional and physiological adaptability in musicians to psychosocial stressors.
In relation to previous research in this field, this thesis is—to my knowledge—the first that
addresses music performance stress alongside advanced methods in signal processing and
drawn from complexity science. In terms of a gross evaluation of musicians’ physiological
responses to performance stress by means of investigating changes in heart rate (rather than
heart rate variability), studies have shown that musicians experience increased heart rate
either before or during performance or both in front of an audience and audition panel, respectively (Abel & Larkin, 1990; Brotons, 1994; Craske & Craig, 1984; Yoshie, Shigemasu, et
al., 2009). They have examined different pre-performance periods, ranging anywhere from
100 s to 5 min beforehand, and have monitored heart rate at different intervals (which impacts on the capacity to detect subtle changes). In terms of the frequency domain analysis,
there are two existing studies that have investigated the ECG frequency distribution in musicians in musicians undergoing different performance contexts (Harmat & Theorell, 2009;
Harmat et al., 2010). Their results show an increase in HF at the beginning of the performance, followed by a dominant LF power during the performance.
However, these findings are not comparable to the results of my findings due to the following reasons: According to the recommendations of the Task Force of the European Society
of Cardiology, recordings of heart rate variability should be standardised to a minimum of
5-minute epochs to ensure consistent assessment across studies, and analysed by the division of the electrocardiographic (ECG) signal into clinically relevant frequency components (for more details, see Chapter 3). The studies (Harmat & Theorell, 2009; Harmat et

172

Chapter 8. Conclusion

al., 2010) that did acknowledge the application of the frequency domain analysis to analyse
changes in musicians’ heart rate variability used (1) 1-minute intervals to calculate specific
frequency components and (2) applied their measures on a sample of flautists and singers.
Both the time segments chosen and the sample characteristics (singers and flautists execute
distinctive breathing patterns which affect the ECG in a unique manner [for more details,
see Chapter 1]) make a comparison with my findings almost impossible.

Thus, the approach used in my thesis allowed a standardised assessment of performance
stress supported by validated guidelines provided by the Task Force (for more details, see
Chapter 2) on how to analyse cardiovascular signals. The results show that indeed the minutes before a performer goes on stage creates the highest state physical alertness. These
findings somewhat resemble the appraisal models such as the component process model
(Scherer, 2009, introduced in Chapter 1), which states that an increased SNS activity is most
likely found in situation where the person is not in control or has little power to make significant changes. Indeed, based on my personal experience, musicians often do not know
what to expect before actually going on stage and perform. This is likely to create a feeling
of a decreased degree of capability over the performance situation.

In light of the physiological framework introduced by Berntson et al. (1991), which views
responses of the autonomic nervous system as product of the interplay between SNS and
PNS that might occur reciprocal (negative correlated) nonreciprocal (positively correlated)
or uncoupled (not correlated), including a specific dynamic, range, and lability between
them, the results of my thesis suggest that an increase in both LF and HF power during
the performance was caused by a positively correlated interplay between between both the
SNS and PNS. Conversely, the pre-performance period, which generated a low LF and HF
power in the low-stress condition, but a high LF power and low HF power in the high-stress
condition suggest that the pre-performance period in the low-stress condition, characterised
by a negative correlated SNS and PNS activity, and the pre-performance period in the highstress condition, defined by an uncoupled or not correlated SNS and PNS activity, do indeed
cause distinctive physiological (and psychological) patterns in the autonomic space.

8.3. Limitations

173

The second part of this thesis examined selected training strategies and their impact, including the application of simulated performance spaces (Chapters 5, 6 & 7). Effective simulations should provide adequate sensory feedback and graphical (virtual) reality which should
both be displayed precisely and with low time latency (Mazuryk & Gervautz, 1996). The
simulation training in this study was able to present realistic visual and auditory feedback to
an extent that allowed the majority of students to experience some feeling of immersion. Immersion experiences in this study were enhanced by auditory and visual cues (background
noise and spotlights), and the interaction with the virtual audience and audition panel as
well as a combination of high-resolution human computer interface and prompt and fluent
feedback, synchronised within and between different modalities (e.g., visual and auditory
feedback).
The musicians’ preference to use simulation training to enhance specific performance skills,
rather than to reduce performance anxiety, is a new finding not previously observed in other
studies using simulation training for musicians (Bissonnette et al., 2015; Orman, 2003, 2004).
Orman (2003) and Bissonnette et al. (2015) found no discernible and consistent patterns of
change in either self-reported anxiety levels or heart rate for musicians taking part in a virtual intervention offering graded exposure to stressful performance situations. My studies
focused on the face validity of simulation training rather than the assessment of the simulation as an interventional tool. Indeed, my results suggest that while simulation training may
indeed be able to reduce performance anxiety, the results of this study expand the potential
of simulation training as a tool to acquire and practice specific performance skills, providing
more options for optimising preparation for (high-pressure) performances of all types.

8.3

Limitations

In the following, I would like to emphasise the limitations of my studies before offering
future avenues for further work.
In study 1, my case study, while I offer valuable insight into how MSE analysis can be

174

Chapter 8. Conclusion

applied to data collected in real-world contexts, the MSE method should be extended to
investigate jointly the dynamics of other physiological or psychological parameters (e.g.,
respiration rate or feelings of anxiety) under stressful conditions.
In study 2, I focused on combining physiological and psychological measures, analysed
within the framework of complexity loss theory, which has allowed us to analyse data from
a number of performers and to extend the current single-person analysis to address a more
general issue of musicians’ emotional and physiological adaptability to psychosocial stressors. Further work should embed multivariate physiological data (heart rate variability,
respiration rate, skin conductance, etc.) collection and analysis and the examination of these
in relation to strategies for coping and self-efficacy, benchmarked against musicians’ overall performance quality during different performance events and in different performance
contexts.
In study 3, I focused on responses to simulated recital and audition scenarios with relatively
neutral and ‘well-behaved’ virtual observers. Subsequent studies should examine the influence of disruptions and distractions (e.g., coughing, sneezing, phone ringing), as well as
more positive and negative observer responses. They should also consider larger samples
of musicians, who can specifically be studied in low and high anxiety groups. In addition, there is scope for building and testing further simulated environments: from changing
audience size or modifying the number and type of environmental features to involving
more performers or altering the performance task itself. It would also be instructive to test
whether the degree of background knowledge about the development of the simulations or
prior knowledge of whether the performer will encounter a real or virtual audience before
they enter the stage (i.e., a blind experiment) would impact how musicians perceive and
interact with each simulation.
In study 4, I qualitatively assessed musicians’ experience of using simulation training to
gather performance experience. However, only women who were enrolled in an optional
performance psychology module took part. This means that no information of the experience of simulation training for men was gathered, and through their enrolment on the mod-

8.3. Limitations

175

ule, students may not have pursued different solutions to help improve their performances,
which in turn may have increased the risk of a sampling-bias. Nevertheless, I encouraged
students to evaluate critically both advantages and disadvantages of their experience using
simulation training. This was hoped to not only counteract sampling-bias but also to reduce
the influence of the order of interview and reflective commentaries.

In study 5, I assessed musicians’ feelings of anxiety and changes in their electrocardiographic data whilst performing in front of an either positively or negatively behaving virtual audition panel. Future studies however should consider additional information, such
as changes in musicians’ self-efficacy or coping abilities. Self-efficacy is the actual belief
to achieve a goal successfully while the coping ability is characterised by the efforts—
behavioural and psychological—to master, tolerate, or minimise distressing events (Bandura & Locke, 2003). Both could have been affected by the valence of the feedback given and
should therefore be targeted in future research. Furthermore, it would have been instructive
to assess the musicians’ stress signatures in their heart rate ‘recovery.’ Heart rate recovery
is the time needed to return to baseline and has been related to higher levels of trait anxiety
and decreased emotional regulation (Pu et al., 2010).1 Moreover, possible confounding factors, such as health status, sleep patterns, the frequency and intensity of physical exercise,
or individual coping strategies have not been addressed in this study. It is widely known
that physical fitness, pro-healthy behaviour and active problem-focused coping strategies
mediate the performance experience and impact on the level of perceived stress (Daniels
& Guppy, 1994). The consideration of these factors may provide a better insight into the
physiological stress responses and its distinctive features due to the performance context
and individual response specificity (Scherer, 2009).

1 Future

research should therefore clarify the relationship between emotional and physiological reactivity/recovery with regards to individual characteristics, such as appraisal and coping (Stephens, Christie, &
Friedman, 2010).

176

8.3.1

Chapter 8. Conclusion

What I would have done differently and why

My research focus in this thesis was the assessment and evaluation of performance stress
and simulation training amongst musicians. While the studies conducted provide an initial
insight into which methods can be used to analyse stress and simulation training, I did not
consider the evaluation of the concept of performance stress, which not only involves two
specific stress responses (heart rate variability and the feeling of anxiety), but also the consideration of musicians’ health-promoting behaviours and coping abilities (for more details,
see Chapter 2). As described in Chapter 1, performance stress is determined by a specific
stressor and its interpretation and processing, followed by a stress response through the activation of specific areas in the central nervous system. The stressor of performing is furthermore interpreted and processed automatically, or it may incorporate higher cognitive processes, Including a detailed evaluation in terms of motivational relevance and congruence,
future expectancy and whether the situation is self- or other-imposed (Compas et al., 2014;
Scherer, 2009). Based on my set-up of the study designs, it was not possible to determine
to what extent musicians experienced performance as a stressor and to what extent they applied coping strategies (and, more importantly, which ones) to deal with performance. This
would have added a more in-depth understanding of performance stress because it allows
for consideration of the stressor, the interpretation and the stress response.
In terms of the simulation training, I would have considered a more theoretical approach
in understanding the impact of simulation training on learning. While the feedback form
based on Kassab et al. (2011) enabled an assessment of how realistically the simulation was
perceived and whether the simulation can be used to tackle specific performance skills, it
either only partially addressed or did not address the well-established stages of learning
proposed by Kirkpatrick and Kirkpatrick (2006), which involve four levels of evaluation:
whether the participant liked the simulation (i.e., reactions), learned from the simulation
(i.e., learning), applied what they have learned from the simulation training (i.e., behaviour),
and whether there is an increased feeling of safety regarding real-life performance following
the implementation of the simulation training (i.e., organisational impact). Acknowledging

8.3. Limitations

177

these aspects would have helped to gain a better understanding of the impact of simulation
training—not only regarding performance stress responses, but also in terms of the actual
benefits of simulation training as a learning environment.

Chapter 8. Conclusion

Avenues for future research

The findings of this thesis offer avenues for further research in two main areas, namely in
terms of (1) methodological considerations and (2) practical considerations. Thus, the following sections focus on performance stress and endocrinological responses, performance
stress and pulmonary responses, performance stress and neurological responses, performance stress and behavioural responses, performance stress across age and musical genres,
as well as simulation training and other virtual displays and simulation training and other
sensory feedback. From a practical point of view, future studies are encouraged to address
the topics performance stress and Alexander Technique, performance stress and physical exercise, performance stress and mental skills training, performance stress and self-regulated
learning, performance stress and smartphone applications performance stress and the optimal zone of functioning.

8.4.1

Methodological considerations

Performance stress and endocrinological responses

Physiological and psychological stress responses not only result in alterations in cardioor pulmonary functioning, but also in activation of the endocrinological system. The endocrinological system is the link between the central nervous system and the endocrine
system and responsible for distributing hormones into the body. As such, the evaluation
of the endocrinological responses, in particular the release of the commonly known stress
hormone cortisol appears a likely next step for further research.
To put this into context, two important mediators between performance stress and the release of stress hormones are the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, encompassing the hypothalamus, the pituitary and the adrenal glands (located in the kidneys), as well as the sympathetic adrenal medullar system, which is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system

8.4. Avenues for future research

179

and the adrenal modular (also a part of the adrenal glands). The hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis is an auto-regulated system that prevents the human system against homeostatic disturbances (Nicolson, 2007). It functions as a stress control system and, in doing
so, ensures a balanced distribution between an external/internal stressor and the physiological response. This is done by the activation of the central nervous system and the
hippocampus, sending corticotrophin-releasing hormones and arginine vasopressin (AVP)
from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary gland. The anterior pituitary gland then
secretes the adrenocorticotropic hormone, which is circulated into the blood system. Reaching the zona fasciculata (i.e., middle zone) of the adrenal glands, located in the kidneys, it
promotes its two divisions, the outer adrenal cortex and the inner medulla—one producing glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, the other, related to the sympathetic adrenal medullar
system, providing catecholamines, such as epinephrine or norepinephrine. The function of
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis can be seen as a ‘. . . closed-loop system involving
tight negative-feedback control mediated by the glucocorticoids exerting multiple regulatory actions’ (Fulford & Harbuz, 2003, p. 47). The regulated feedback can be of short or long
duration, causing either an immediate circulation of glucocorticoids, lasting for 5-30 minutes, or a delayed response with increased glucocorticoid levels which lasts for up to four
hours.2
If the stress becomes chronic, the endocrine system is deregulated, resulting in a deterioration and decrease in general health, characterised through muscle loss, immune system
suppression, depression and increased blood pressure and cholesterol and body fat. Unfortunately, in the musical domain, only a handful of studies have addressed th impact of
performance stress on endocrinological responses.
Starting chronologically, Fredrikson and Gunnarsson (1992) assessed endocrinological reactions, including cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine to performances by string musicians. Endocrine measures were collected via urine samples one hour before and 30 minutes
2 In general,

the cortisol level throughout the day fluctuates in designated patterns, with the highest/lowest
level in the morning/night, including a daily range between 6-23 mcg/dl (micrograms per decilitre) per day
(Schmidt-Reinwald et al., 1999), and is influenced by emotional and physical stress (e.g., exercise, depression,
anxiety) or by the intake of substances, such as caffeine and nicotine.

after musicians were asked to perform in two conditions: (1) no audience and (2) a public
concert. Subjective reports were recorded using the Personal Report of Confidence as a Musician (Appel, 1976) and the Report of Confidence as a Speaker (Paul, 1966). The results
demonstrated significantly elevated endocrinological responses prior to the public performance compared to no audience.
Gill, Murphy, and Rockerd (2006) asked 35 19-year-old students playing different instruments to perform a technical performance exam in front of two judges while a baseline measure was taken six weeks after. Questionnaires, such as the modified competitive subjective
state anxiety questionnaire (CSAI-M: Martens et al., 1990), the Music Performance Anxiety
Questionnaire (Cox & Kenardy, 1993), as well as saliva samples were collected during the
baseline measure and after the jury condition. The results revealed a significantly higher
cortisol response alongside subjective reports during the exam. However, the relation of
performance anxiety intensity and direction was not specifically examined.
Halleland, Sornes, Murison, and Ursin (2009) explored the relationship between subjective
health complaints/coping strategies and stress reactivity. Thirty-five musicians of a philharmonic orchestra took part by filling in a Subjective Health Complaint Inventory (Eriksen, Ihlebaek, & Ursin, 1992), a questionnaire that asks about 29 common health complaints, rated
on a 4-point Likert Scale (0=‘Not bothered’, 1=‘A little bothered’, 2=‘Somewhat bothered’,
3=‘Much bothered’), experienced during the last 30 days. The items were separated into five
domains: (1) musculoskeletal complaints; (2) ‘pseudoneurology’ (tiredness, mood changes);
(3) gastrointestinal complaints; (4) allergic complaints; and (5) cold. In addition to the Subjective Health Complaint Inventory, the Utrecht Coping List was administered, assessing
seven different coping strategies (e.g., active problem-solving, palliative reactions, passive
avoidance, seeking social support, depressive reaction patterns, expression of feelings, and
comforting thoughts) rated on a 4-point Likert Scale, with higher scores indicating a higher
level of active problem solving abilities (e.g., calm in the situation, considers different solutions, and solves the problem in an instrumental way). Cortisol samples were collected two
days before a major concert, on the day of the concert, and two days after the concert at the
following times: at awaking [T1], 30 minutes after awaking [T2] and at 8pm [T3]. Results for

the Subjective Health Complaint Inventory showed no difference between musicians and
the remaining population, except for ‘pseudoneurological’ complaints. Cortisol was significantly more increased during the concert [T3] than during the normal workdays. Musicians
scoring high on the Subjective Health Complaint Inventory showed higher cortisol concentrations during evening workdays [T3] than musicians scoring low on the Subjective Health
Complaint Inventory. In general the Subjective Health Complaint Inventory explained 15%
of the cortisol level, while the sub scale gastrointestinal complaints accounting for 24% cortisol release at awaking [T1]. Last, musicians using an emotion-focused problem solving
approach were related to 18% of the cortisol level. No other associations between cortisol
and Subjective Health Complaint Inventory or the Utrecht Coping List could be found.
Pilger et al. (2014) collected pro-inflammatory and oxidative responses, such as cortisol,
plasma myeloperoxidase, serum CRP, and plasma IL-6 by blood (venepuncture) and saliva
samples (Salivette cortisol tubes) of 48 members of a symphony orchestra. Levels of state
anxiety were collected by self-reports (Self-assessment Manikin: Bradley & Lang, 1994) on
the day of the rehearsal and the performance, while blood samples were taken immediately after and during their break in both low- and high-stress conditions. Saliva samples
were collected at five time points: at awaking (T1), after 30 minutes (T2), between 11:30
am-12:30 (T3) pm 3:00 pm-4:00pm (T4) as well as between 6:00 pm-7:00pm (T5). Finally, a
Work ability index questionnaire (WAI: Tuomi, Ilmarinen, Jahkola, Katajarinne, & Tulkki,
1998) with scores ranging from 7 to 49, including the categories excellent (44-49 points),
good (37-43 points), moderate (28-36 points), poor (7-27 points) was used. Results demonstrated a significant increased level of cortisol for T1, T3, T5, IL-6, and MPO on the day
of premier compared to the dressed rehearsal, a significantly increased SAM from low- to
high-stress condition. Age was negatively correlated with the WAI. A correlation between
physiological and psychological (Self-assessment Manikin) measurements was only found
for the myeloperoxidase and cortisol at T3. No association to other biomarkers was found.
Interestingly, a comparison between Second violinists and First violinists showed a significant increased level of cortisol in the first violin.
Most recently, Fancourt, Aufegger, and Williamon (2015) examined the impact of singing in

182

Chapter 8. Conclusion

a low-stress performance situation and a high-stress live concert on levels of glucocorticoids
(cortisol and cortisone) in fifteen professional singers. This study demonstrated that singing
was associated with a reduced cortisol/cortisone ratio, indicating a diminished overall stress
response. Furthermore, across performances, low-stress conditions showed decreases in
cortisol and cortisone, while high-stress conditions triggered an increase in both. These
results confirm previous findings that low-stress performance conditions lead to reductions
in cortisol and that high-stress conditions lead to increases, which is indicative of a more
general hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response (Beck, Cesario, Yousefi, & Enamoto,
2000).3
Based on these results, future studies are encouraged to look at endocrinological responses
in a variety of musical settings. Indeed, measuring and evaluating endocrinological responses, such as cortisol, are quite straightforward (Nicolson, 2007). Cortisol can be assessed
in blood, saliva, or urine. Depending on the technique, each method offers advantages and
disadvantages. Collecting urine, for instance, has the negative side effect of reduced compliance of participants as well as the challenge of safe transportation from testing site to
laboratory. On the other hand, it does not really interfere with the participants’ routines,
providing samples every 2-3 hours and, thus, is preferably used for longitudinal studies.
Blood has the advantage of containing a high level of cortisol concentration, but also requires slightly invasive finger pricks and participants need to be warned in advance. Given
these practical problems, the majority of research has begun to focus on the analysis of cortisol in saliva. Collecting saliva can be done without a licence and is easy to gather via cotton
ropes, swabs or sponges, triggered by chewing or acid in the cotton swab (Kirschbaum &
Hellhammer, 2000). They can be stored at room temperature, in a refrigerator, or in a freezer
(Nicolson, 2007). Samples kept at room temperature are durable from 7 days to 4 weeks, in
a refrigerator up to 3 months and in a freezer up to years, alleviating the risk of decay over
time. Moreover, they are not affected by thawing or refreezing (Garde & Hansen, 2005).
3 It

has to be taken into consideration that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response is also modulated by the appraisal of the distressing event, and thus, the degree to which the stress response is seen is
impacted by the ability to cope with the stressor (Kemeny, 2003). The evidence of increased glucocorticoids
in response to high-stress singing found in their study, independent of experience, age or number of previous
concerts, shows that regardless of the constant exposure to performance situations, singers still exhibit a rather
basic fight-flight response.

8.4. Avenues for future research

183

However, to avoid any biases of cortisol concentration, participants should be asked to not
drink liquids, eat or smoke at least 2 hours before the assessment.4
Last, it is important to mention that there are several ways to extract cortisol, most of them
done in specific laboratories. One of the most commonly used techniques are the radioimmunoassay (RIA), the time-resolved immunoassay with fluorometric detection (DELFIA)
and the enzyme immunoassay (EIA: Nicolson, 2007), all of which rely on the competitive
binding between free cortisol and reagents.5 Once the data is available for further processing, the researcher may extract the cortisol concentration through the calculation of the
percentage, the ratio, and the mean and standard deviation of the temporal shifts in cortisol release levels. Other, more advanced tools that enable a meaningful interpretation of
the data is the examination of the area under the curve with respect to the ground and the
overall increase, respectively. The main argument of computing the area under the curve
is its simple statistical analysis and the increase in statistical power without having to sacrifice information collected over multiple time points. While the area under the curve with
respect to the ground detects the changes occurring over time, the area under the curve with
respect to the increase identifies the overall intensity (Pruessner, Kirschbaum, Meinlschmid,
& Hellhammer, 2003). For the latter, the main intention is to get more information about
the changes in the cortisol reaction curve.6 After the extraction takes place at the laboratory
of choice, statistical packages such as SPSS can be used to analyse and make sense of the
results.
Performing music in public is widely recognised as a potentially stress-inducing activity.
However, despite the interest in music performance as an acute psychosocial stressor, there
4 Recently,

secretions of cortisol have also been found in skin and tested hair samples (Sharpley, Kauter,
& McFarlane, 2009). This was tested in an exploratory study by Sharpley et al. (2009), who compared cortisol, collected by means of saliva and hair samples before and after an acute physical stressor (pain inducing
stressor) was applied on one arm of the participant. Interestingly, cortisol extracted from the hair samples were
‘. . . (a) swift but transitory; (b) localised to the site of the pain; and (c) independent of the central hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis as represented by salivary cortisol’ (Sharpley et al., 2009, p. 760), supporting the ‘localisation’ hypothesis—a ‘peripherally’ working hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
5 The choice of technique depends on the availability of the laboratories, the price of chemical kits, but also
on the characteristic of the sample of population; for instance whether the participants that take part in the
study are classified as either healthy or clinical participants.
6 A major limitation of these two, however, is the requirement of a steady and gradual increase of cortisol
concentration. If this is not the case, the area under the curve goes towards zero, suggesting a spuriously
non-existing increase.

184

Chapter 8. Conclusion

has been relatively little research on the effects of public performance on the endocrine system. The simplicity of collection and analyses of endocrinological responses make the investigation of these responses extremely useful.
Future studies should address these responses in relation to solo versus group performances, as well as between men and women. It has been shown that both differ in their
baseline physiology (heart rate, breathing rate, cortisol: Kirschbaum & Hellhammer, 2000).
All these unresolved questions offer great potential for some new insights into musicians’
overall physiological responses to performance stress.

Performance stress and (cardio-)pulmonary responses

Musical performance typically leads to an activity in both cardio and pulmonary responses,
including changes in heart rate variability and breathing. While the impact of performance
stress on heart rate has been addressed, corresponding research into the respiratory effects
of performance stress by comparison is meagre. This is not surprising given that traditional
measures obtaining respiration are either too intrusive or simply to imprecise to offer an adequate evaluation of pulmonary functioning. Moreover, the respiratory responses to stress
are complex, and decomposition into meaningful respiration metrics have resulted in a variety of methods of analyses. To put this into context, respiration can be classified in terms of
(1) volume and timing parameters, (2) measures that evaluate the analysis of the breathing
curve, and (3) measures reflecting gas exchange (Boiten, Frijda, & Wientjes, 1994). While the
aspect of volume and time parameters have been discussed in Chapter 1, the measures that
evaluate the analysis of the breathing curve apply the so called ‘shape factor,’ which helps
to determine the phase of expiratory pause, which is not considered by the volume and timing parameters. Last, the measures reflecting gas exchange allow for the assessment of the
arterial carbon dioxide tension. The arterial carbon dioxide determines the level to which
ventilation is in balance with the metabolic output. Irregular or disproportionate ventilation
(also called hyperventilation) causes more arterial carbon dioxide than can be disposed by
the organism and results in a decrease of partial arterial carbon dioxide lower than the nor-

8.4. Avenues for future research

185

mal range. Researchers interested in analysing the measures reflecting gas exchange should
evaluate whether the ventilation is in balance with the metabolic processes and also consider
other metrics, such as energy expenditure (Wientjes, 1992).
Devices to record respiration, among others, are the spirometer, measuring the volume of
air during inhalation and exhalation, or employ measures to monitor the motions executed
of the chest and the abdomen. However, both involve a degree of intrusiveness for the
performer, making the application of these devices in performance science less common.
To date, only one study has faced the challenge of respiration detection alongside the analysis of heart rate variability during music performing (and using state-of-the-art signal processing approaches). This was achieved by Hemakom, Goverdovsky, Aufegger, and Mandic
(2016), who evaluated the very specific activity of respiration during choir singing, where
highly synchronised performance of the individual singer is dictated by the tempo and demands of a musical score. In doing so, their aim was to provide a quantitative measure of the
level of cooperation, displayed by the synchronisation between singers’ responses in respiration and heart rate variability. To this end, they employed two new measures, the intrinsic
phase synchrony and intrinsic coherence in five members of a choir and the conductor during a low-stress rehearsal and a high-stress concert. The results showed that both methods
applied reveal a noticeable increase in coordination from the rehearsal to the performance,
less agreement has been observed between groups, such as the choir and the conductor.
Furthermore, the intrinsic phase synchrony was able to identify phase relationship of both
physiological signals in all situations effectively, allowing for a purposeful interpretation of
the data. They have also shown that the characteristics of the SNS and PNS shown during
both performance conditions were primarily mediated by respiration.
Overall, both the proposed techniques revealed synchronisation of singers’ heart rate variability and respiration. Future studies are therefore encouraged to evaluate this promising
new avenue of signal processing to different performance contexts, using a bigger sample
size or a more controlled performance environment, such can be found in simulation training.

Chapter 8. Conclusion

Performance stress and neurological responses

As mentioned above, performance stress has negative effects on the autonomic nervous system and physiological responsiveness. These effects can be identified and quantified in biosignal channels, such as ECG, and electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography
(EEG).
Despite the majority of research that exists to examine the relationship between physiological responses and stress, little has been done to understand the potential impact music performance stress may have on musical performance. So far, research has shown that stress
reducing experiences, such as the sensation of positive emotions or approach-related behaviour is mainly reflected in the left hemisphere of the brain, while the right hemisphere
represent the feeling of negative emotions and avoidance behaviour. In particular, these effects could be found in the prefrontal activity in the brain, which is mainly responsible for
distinctive cognitive and behavioural operations, such as the process of attentional selection
and emotional regulation (Lewis, Weekes, & Wang, 2007). The question however remains
whether stress or the experience of anxiety is also related to this brain region. Recent research suggest that the experience of anxiety is predominantly represented by activations
of brain areas including the dorsolateral, orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortices.
All three are specific prefrontal cortical subregions: The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has
been shown to be related to action selection and processing task-relevant representations
(Mars & Grol, 2007), while the orbitofrontal prefrontal cortex and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex are the centre for emotional regulation and decision making (Bechara, Damasio, & Damasio, 2000). And indeed, while the examination of these regions in relation to a
number of distinctive positive and negative mood states or behaviour such as depression or
fear have been conducted, less attention has been paid to the general experience of stress.
Stress and anxiety share certain features, yet while anxiety is the emotional perception that
may lead to stress or be a precursor, stress is a more general concept and involves the activity
of interpretation and evaluation as well as the application of coping strategies.
Thus far, there is some evidence that stress and health, but also decreased immune function-

8.4. Avenues for future research

187

ing (e.g., increase in cortisol levels: for more details see performance stress and endocrinological system), is reared to an increased activation in the right hemisphere of the brain
(Davidson, 2003). In particular, it has been demonstrated that stress leads to a relatively
greater right prefrontal activity during the exposure to high-stress scenarios and in comparison to low examinations of stress (Lewis et al., 2007).
A number of studies look at EEG and musical performance, however tend to direct their focus towards the role of neurofeedback for musicians. Gruzelier et al. (2014) addressed utilising alpha/theta and sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) neurofeedback training amongst both
novice and advanced instrumentalists during the performance of a prepared and an improvised piece. Their findings identified a distinct correlation between alpha/theta training
and the assessed domains of musicality/creativity, as well as communication and technique.
Furthermore, Gruzelier and Egner (2004) reported improvement in musical performance
amongst children following SMR specifically designed for their study.
These studies provide first insights into biofeedback mechanisms to maximise performance
outcomes, yet there is virtually no research looking into the detection of performance stress
as a warning mechanism. Even across research, the literature that aims to identify the degree
of cognitive neuro-fitness and the prevention of detrimental performance stress is sparse.
Haak, Bos, Panic, and Rothkrantz (2009) was one of the first who developed a stress detecting protocol using eye-blink artifacts in the brain activity by means of EEG monitoring.
The set up of the design included a car driving simulation where stressful emotions were
triggered through steep curves and attention seeking billboards, as well as mental task application. Using low cost EEG solutions, a correlation analysis between eye blink frequency
with experienced stress revealed a significantly higher frequency of eye blinks in stressful
situations, as well as significantly more active brain activity during the mental task.
As such, developments in the technology sector have allowed engineers such as Emotiv Systems to produce their EPOC devices,7 which allow for a complex and detailed EEG measurements whilst experiencing only little disruption and interference with the performer. This

Chapter 8. Conclusion

also includes the fact that measures can be taken within a musician’s familiar surroundings
(e.g., on stage), instead of using laboratory-based hardware and research settings. A key
principal of monitoring musicians’ experience of performance stress should be in acknowledging that utilising such technology enables for complex scientific studies to take place in
a natural environment.
While this is an exciting step towards a better understanding of performance stress, more
research is needed to develop real-life and meaningful application that can be administered
on a potentially daily basis. It is for instance known that repeated stress causes impairments
of spatial memory performance (Luine, Villegas, Martinez, & McEwen, 1994), a particular
crucial aspect musicians should be prevented of. Studies should identify a correlational relationship between an increase in performance stress and the neural activity measured, based
on the change in for instance performance context. Alpha and Beta wavelengths measured
by the EEG device should serve as the focal measuring point, being the wavelength indicative of conscious arousal (Gruzelier et al., 2014). If a correlation is clearly identified, future
studies would be able to pose the possibility that an intervention based on neural activity
representative of performance stress could be designed. Thus, further research is needed
to develop such detection systems that help musicians to reduce performance stress and to
achieve an optimal amount of cognitive neuro-fitness.

Performance stress and behavioural responses

Behavioural manifestations of performance stress can be observed in broad as well as more
specific contexts. While the former is linked with ‘. . . the tendency to escape from or avoid
the source of one’s distress’ (Salmon, 1990, p. 59), the latter is illustrated by behaviour displayed just before a performance, such as exaggerated fidgeting or excessive pacing.
The tendency of procrastination and finding excuses not to attend an important audition
is defined as ‘behavioural self-handicapping’ (Ferrari, 1992). So far, researches about behavioural symptoms of performance stress have been few and far between.

8.4. Avenues for future research

189

Craske and Craig (1984), for instance, explored two features of behavioural components
in musical performance stress; the first was carried out by judges rating touch, phrasing,
pitch, rhythm, tempo, dynamics, memory and overall effectiveness on a 10-point Likert
scale; the second measure was obtained through the use of a timed checklist, including lifted
shoulders, stiff back and neck, deadpan face and moistened lips within 20-second intervals.
Videos were presented in a counterbalanced order, and judges were neither aware of the
group classification (high- versus low-anxiety musicians) nor the performance condition
(alone versus audience). The results demonstrated different behaviours in anxious pianists
compared to relatively non-anxious pianists when performing in both conditions. However,
these differences were not reflected in the performance-quality ratings from low- to highstress performance conditions.8 No effect of the features of the musicians’ behaviour on the
performance-anxiety rating was found.
Wolfe (1989) focussed on behavioural coping strategies and performance stress and, through
a survey, found that maladaptive components of performance stress, namely nervousness,
apprehension and distractibility, are often an indicator of avoiding coping strategies, hindering the promotion of relaxation and the perception of arousal needed for an optimal performance outcome. Moreover, he discovered that musicians who apply emotion-focussed
strategies (for more details, see Chapter 1) are more self-consciousness and experience more
disruptive and distracting cognitive activities (e.g., worry and rumination).
More recently, Juchniewicz (2008) investigated the impact of physical movement on the perception of musical performance. He asked 112 students to rate a pianist giving a performance without exhibiting head, facial or full-body movement on a 5-point Likert scale, asking about phrasing, dynamics, rubato and overall musical performance. Interestingly, the
results showed a significant increase in the performance-quality rating with increased body
movement compared to no movement at all, all of which was independent of the gender of
the students (Davidson, 2012; Tsay, 2013).
While these studies offer some insight into behavioural aspects and music-performance
8 It is worth mentioning that highly anxious musicians had a significantly lower performance-quality rating

compared to non-anxious musicians under high-stress conditions.

190

Chapter 8. Conclusion

stress, as well as its impact on musical performance-quality ratings, noticeably more research needs to be done to understand the interactions between performance stress and
behaviour, implementing more objective analysis methods for evaluation.
Some rigorous research into measuring behavioural changes to assess performance quality and to understand different patterns in behaviour due to performance context has been
done in medicine, particularly for simulation-based training and multidisciplinary team settings. This research has shown that the degree of verbal or non-verbal communication as
well as agreement between members is vital for effectiveness at both individual and grouporganisational levels.
Thus, in order to set up valid simulation-based training for behavioural observation, Shapiro
et al. (2008) offer four main principles or steps that future studies should consider for their
own training development. In step 1, the researcher should determine the overall learning
outcome, such as (verbal and non-verbal) communication, co-ordination and co-operation
between musicians. To obtain a more systematic view of competencies, behavioural measures should identify these in terms of task-work versus teamwork. While task-work can be
estimated by the frequency and subjectively assessed importance of the co-ordination during the specific task, teamwork can be targeted by the team’s change in knowledge, skills
and attitudes.
In step 2, the researcher should provide a guided practise for teamwork behaviour to help
ensure specific skill acquisition (e.g., group stage presence, communication with the audience). Practise opportunities should focus on specific skills, with immediate follow-up feedback about what can be improved and how these improvements can be executed. As such,
simulation-based scenarios should contain ‘triggers’ designed to elicit a given teamwork
response (e.g., specific response/question from the audition panel or audience).
In step 3, measurements should be developed to provide opportunities for learning.
Simulation-based training works most efficiently when measures are developed to identify
team performance. This can, for instance, be achieved through observation protocols, targeted teamwork designs and the assessment and monitoring of specific behavioural markers

8.4. Avenues for future research

191

that are applied so that the observer knows exactly what to assess and what behaviours to
look for. The feedback should then be applied by means of a structured template that allows
for a debriefing of behaviours that did or did not occur.
In step 4, the researcher should establish a robust debriefing protocol that is linked with the
feedback and the targeted learning outcomes. The feedback should be able to determine the
strengths and weaknesses of a group performance, with the researcher applying a diagnostic
scenario-based tool that allows effective debriefings.
For learning opportunities and the open and honest involvement of the trainees (where the
performance process can be shared and discussed, and specific objectives can be addressed),
simulation training, as a safe environment, offers an ideal platform with a decreased risk of
criticism and blame. As such, in order to ensure the establishment of behavioural strategies
that benefit team performance, a collection of scenarios should be created, with each scenario
focussing on a specific set of knowledge, skills and attitudes.

Performance stress across age and musical genres

Classical musicians have been subject to great interest, providing insights into musicians’
personality traits, health-promoting behaviour, and how these two are related to musicians’
mental stress responses to different performance contexts. In contrast, there is little evidence
of performance stress of musicians from other musical fields, such as rock music, as well as
how physiological responses may differ in age such as young musicians or professionals.
Studies that have investigated physiological responses in young versus professional musicians have predominantly focused on changes in heart rate. Inesta et al. (2008), for instance,
monitored heart rate during solo performances and during a performance in an orchestra. By calculating the percentages of the Maximum Theoretical Heart Rate (%MTHR) they
could demonstrate that musical performance is similar to an exercise carried out on a cycleergometer classified as ‘moderate’ to ‘heavy’ levels of work intensity.
Other studies carried out include the work by LeBlanc, Chang Jin, Obert, and Siivola (1997).

192

Chapter 8. Conclusion

They asked members of school bands (no age was provided) to perform: (1) in a private
condition; (2) in front of another person; and (iii) in front of an audience (peer group and
teacher). A self-report on anxiety (10-point Likert Scale and with higher scores indicating a
higher degree of anxiety) designed by the authors was administered immediately after the
performance, while heart rate was measured at 5-second intervals for the first two minutes
of the performance. The results showed significant differences between the self-report and
all three conditions, with the third condition producing the highest levels, followed by the
second and first condition. While heart rate was nit significantly different in condition one
and two—taken together—responses were significantly decreased compared to the performance in front of the audience.
Ryan (1998) asked 12-year-old pianists to undergo a baseline measure and to perform in a
recital. The psychological questionnaire administered was the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (Coopersmith, 1959), while heart rate was monitoring at 5-, 15-, 30-, or 60- intervals,
prior to, and during, the recital. The performance was evaluated by two expert pianists in
terms of technique, tone, rhythm, musicality, interpretation, balance, dynamics, and tempo
(60 ‘Very poor’ to 90 ‘Distinction’). Results showed significantly less self-esteem during the
performance compared to the baseline. This was also mirrored in the heart rates, gradually
increasing from baseline to the pre-performance to the performance condition. In contrast,
no significant difference was found for the performance evaluation. Furthermore, no correlation was detected between the physiological and the psychological measures.
Ryan (2004) monitored 26 young music students (no age provided) during a 45-minute baseline measure, a piano lesson and a recital condition. While the State and Trait Anxiety
Inventory-state form for children (Spielberger & Edwards, 1973) was filled in during the
pre-performance period, the heart rate was monitored throughout both conditions in 15second intervals. An evaluation was carried out in terms of by two expert pianists (r=.84) in
terms of technique, tone, rhythm, musicality, interpretation, balance, dynamics, and tempo
(ranging from 60 [‘Very poor’] to 90 [‘Distinction’]). Moreover, anxiety indicating behaviour
was rated by means of indicating exaggerated feet, legs, body, arms, hands, instrument,
head and face movements.

8.4. Avenues for future research

193

Boucher and Ryan (2010) assessed 66 3-4 year old students during two performances in front
of family members on two successive days. Psychological assessment included the State
and Trait Anxiety Inventory-state form for children (Spielberger et al., 1983), the Music Performance Anxiety Inventory for Adolescents (Kenny & Osborne, 2006) and self-reports on
feeling in terms of performance, musical activity and perceived musical competence. Cortisol measurements were taken three times one week before (baseline) and after the concerts.
The performance was also at 15-second intervals, addressing overt-emotional behaviour,
movements of feet and legs, arms and hands, body, head/face, interactions with objects and
people. Results showed that 75% of the sample experienced signs of anticipatory stress, yet
no statistical report was provided. Previous musical performance experience had a significant impact on anticipatory stress with more experienced students showing a greater level
of perceived stress. Sex and age did not contribute to the outcome. Cortisol was significantly
higher after the first concert, but decreased to an almost baseline level after the second performance. Previous experience significantly impacted on the cortisol level with more experienced musicians showing a greater cortisol secretion. Two independent observers (intrareliability=.89) detected significantly more overt-emotional behaviour (e.g., avoidance and
refusal) in the first concert compared to the second concert and baseline measure. Anxious
behaviour was more likely in 3 than in 4-year-old students. No information on each category
(‘behavioural assessment’) was provided. Low-anxious students revealed a higher cortisol
release than moderately anxious students. This accounted for both baseline measure and
concert conditions. No correlation between all three measurements was detected.

In contrast, other musical genres such as rock musicians have mainly been explored in terms
of their life-style. Rock musicians carry out immense physical engagement with an audience
and the extent to which they endeavour and support healthy (pre-performance) behaviour
has a direct impact on their degree of stress reactivity and, therefore, stress management
(Lehmann & Kopiez, 2013). However, most studies on rock musicians have only shown
interest in rock musicians’ life-style, personality traits (Gillespie & Myors, 2000; Hernandez, Russo, & Schneider, 2009), substance abuse (Miller & Quigley, 2011) and how they are
shaped by stereotypical perception (Cameron, Duffy, & Glenwright, 2014).

194

Chapter 8. Conclusion

Gillespie and Myors (2000), for instance, asked 100 rock and pop musicians to complete
the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1992), concluding that rock
musicians—compared to the wider population—tend to be greater in openness, neuroticism and excitement seeking and poor in agreeableness and conscientiousness. Miller and
Quigley (2011) examined the relationship between personality traits, musical genre and substance abuse. A sample consisting of 226 amateur and professional musicians were asked to
complete a personality questionnaire (Zuckerman, Kuhlman, Joireman, Teta, & Kraft, 1993),
a short test of musical preferences (Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003) and a questionnaire on drug
abuse (Sobell, Kwan, & Sobell, 1995). Results revealed high levels of correlation between
sensation seeking, substance abuse, such as tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana in rebellious
genres, such as heavy metal, punk and rock music as opposed to jazz, classical or pop music. Hernandez et al. (Hernandez et al., 2009) examined personality traits and cognitive
abilities in four rock band members by administering the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2 (MMPI-2: Hathaway & McKinley, 1940) and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence
Scale III (WAIS-III: Wechsler, 1958). The results showed an increased tendency towards depression, anxiety, pessimism, and egocentric attitudes, yet also a high degree of dedication,
persistence, and acceptance of third-party helpers.
Most recently, Cameron et al. (2014) reported the extent to which personality traits have
been formed by stereotypical and social perception. Five hundred and ten musicians were
asked to categorise their band ‘position’ (e.g., ‘What are singers like’?) and to complete
a range of personality questionnaires (e.g., Mini-IPIP: Donnellan, Oswald, Baird, & Lucas,
2006). Perceptions and personality traits significantly predicted each other, with e.g., singers
exhibiting greater extraversion than bassists, as well as higher openness to experience than
drummers.
The studies above offer first insights into personality traits and the life-style of rock musicians, however, none of them investigated rock musicians’ physical and mental responses
to performing. Future studies may therefore focus on rock musicians’ health-promoting
behaviour, pre-performance behaviour alongside musicians’ physical and mental stress experienced in low- and high-stress conditions.

Simulation and virtual reality

My evaluation of the simulation developed at the Royal College of Music was a first step
towards a better understanding of alternative methods for training and enhancing performance experiences. However, future studies should compare the concept of ‘distributed
simulation’ with other simulation tools; for instance, current technologies available are the
head-mounted display or the cave automatic virtual environment (Krijn et al., 2004). The
head-mounted display is a head-worn helmet that generates virtual objects in front of the
eyes. The cave automatic virtual environment is a performance space of computer-projected
screens using tracking systems. Current tracking systems can be divided into three categories: magnetic, acoustic or visual trackers. All three use different types of data detection,
yet they all encompass a source (i.e., emitter), sensors (i.e., receivers), and a control station. For the magnetic tracker, magnetic fields are picked up by the sensors and fed back to
the control station in order to calculate the position and orientation of the user within the
system. The advantages of magnetic trackers are their relatively small sensors, their nonsensitivity towards acoustic interference, their high update rate and low latency, as well as
their off-the-shelf availability (Mazuryk & Gervautz, 1996). Disadvantages include possible
distortion by metal units as well as the requirement of a relatively close distance between
the user and the tracking system. Acoustic trackers, by contrast, use ultrasonic waves above
20 kHz for data transmission. Advantages of acoustic trackers include their small size as
well as their compatibility with magnetic interferences. Disadvantages include inaccurate
measurements due to noise or echoes, as well as a low update rate (compared to magnetic
trackers). Visual trackers can be applied in various forms, including LEDs (i.e., beacon trackers), or laser ranging—laser lights that capture the body’s surface via diffraction grating.
Both offer high update rates and are not sensitive to magnetic, metallic or acoustic objects.
Their main disadvantage, however, is their complex construction as well as their difficulty
with tracking more than one person at the same time (Mazuryk & Gervautz, 1996). Nevertheless, in contrast with the ‘distributed simulation’ and the head-mounted display, the
computer automatic virtual environment offers (1) a higher resolution of images without

196

Chapter 8. Conclusion

geometric distortions, (2) a decrease in stimulus-latency, and (3) the capability of successive
refinement between the user’s performance and the virtual feedback.

To put this into context, Kim, Rosenthal, Zielinski, and Brady (2012) compared the impact
of different virtual environment technologies on emotional arousal and task performance.
To induce emotions during the task performance, they used the Stroop task under lowand high-stress conditions with 53 participants. The responses to the virtual environments
were validated in three systems, namely a desktop system, head-mounted display, and a
computer automatic virtual environment with a six-wall construction. Physiological and
psychological markers of stress and the perception of immersion were assessed by means
of self-reported emotional arousal and valence, skin conductance, task performance, presence and simulator sickness.9 The results showed that the computer automatic virtual environment induced the highest level of immersion and positive emotion, while the headmounted display triggered the highest amount of simulator sickness and negative emotions.
The physiological responses showed mixed results. As such, the authors concluded that
‘. . . different virtual environment systems may be appropriate for different scientific purposes when studying stress reactivity using emotionally evocative tasks’ (Kim et al., 2012,
p. 267). For instance, while the cave automatic virtual environments could be applied in
studies examining the impact of relaxation treatments on stress responses, head-mounted
displays could be a valuable tool for effectively treating anxiety disorders in psychotherapeutically developed settings (Kim et al., 2012).

Future studies should therefore apply the concept of various simulation-training environments to address performance stress and performance enhancement and to compare the
benefits of ‘distributed simulation’ and other technologies, such as head-mounted displays
and cave automatic virtual environments.

9 Simulator sickness is triggered by inaccurate latency feedback as well as frame rate (Mazuryk & Gervautz,

1996).

Simulation and sensory feedback
How well simulation training is perceived by users usually depends on two features: the
users’ characteristics, such as their cognition, expectations or personality, and the technology
used (Parsons & Rizzo, 2008; Sas & O’Hare, 2002; Schubert et al., 2001; Wallach, Safir, & BarZvi, 2009). Both facilitate the feeling of presence, which is ‘. . . the subjective experience of
being in one place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another’ (Witmer
& Singer, 1998, p. 225). In other words, an increased degree of presence comes with an
enhanced ability to ‘overlook’ or ‘neglect’ the knowledge of the artificial aspects of simulated
performance training. This depends on the technology used and the application of adequate
sensory feedback, such as vision, hearing, touch, smell and taste.10
Vision, for instance, is the most dominant and important sense, enabling an organised perception of motion, size, shape, distance, relative position and texture (Downtown & Leedham, 1991). To perceive an object as three-dimensional, several features have to be considered: luminance, brightness, contrast, the visual angle and acuity, as well as the visual field.
Luminance describes the light reflected by an object; brightness refers to the light’s perception; contrast represents the relationship between the light rendered from an object and the
surrounding background. All three gather information about the object, including depth,
texture and angle. To put this into context, an object with specific light and distance generates a certain angle, which can be measured in minutes or seconds of arc. Human-computer
interfaces are considered as sufficient if the visual angle is at least 15 min of arc (which is
equivalent to 4.3 mm viewed from 1 m [considering the size and the layout of the display]).
If the simulation allows the head and eyes to move freely (assuming a normal flexibility of
the neck), then the binocular vision is known to range between 100 degrees (◦ ) and 120◦ (of
a straight-ahead position), while monocular vision is represented by 360◦ . For a simulated
environment, the ideal view is ± 90◦ , with ±15◦ for a straight-ahead position. Another aspect is colour, which is nothing more than visible light observable between spectrums of
400-700 nanometers, which allows us to differentiate approximately 128 colours (consider10 Taste

and smell are classified as human senses, yet have not been applied in research on simulation training, mainly because these two senses are not part of humans’ primary senses.

198

Chapter 8. Conclusion

ing constant luminance and saturation). Precise colour discrimination is only available in a
straight-ahead position of ±60◦ , while a general awareness of colours increases the field to

± 90◦ .
Hearing is the second most important human sense.

Its perception ranges from

20 −20.000 Hz, but functions best within 1000 −4000 Hz (Normal conversations are held between 50 dB and 70 dB, but are affected by background noises and individual confounders
such as age and hearing conditions.). Unfortunately, sound is not as investigated or implemented in simulations as visual feedback due to the complexity of generating authentic
auditory feedback (Gaver, 1997).
The impact of sensory feedback on the perception of simulation training and learning outcomes has been examined by Larsson, Västfjall, and Kleiner (2001). In particular, they assessed the learning effects of stimuli, including visual feedback or both visual and auditory
feedback, while participants had to perform two memory and navigation tasks. The effect
itself was measured by the time spent solving the tasks. The results demonstrated a superior
outcome for the visual and auditory feedback in terms of time, but also an increased degree
of presence. In a follow-up study, Larsson, Vastfjall, and Kleiner (2002) investigated the relationship between presence and auditory stimuli. For this, participants were asked to rate
their level of presence, their awareness of external factors, and their simulation sickness (an
indicator of a higher level of immersion). The results showed that the bimodal mode had a
significant impact not only on the time spent solving the task but also on enhanced feelings
of presence, focus and enjoyment. In a second study, the auditory stimuli were moreover divided into low versus high quality. The results showed that participants exposed to greater
auditory fidelity showed higher levels of presence, although the higher quality of the audio
stimuli did not produce better performance outcomes.
Other studies, such as the one by Lokki and Gröss (2005), compared visual, auditory and
audio-visual cues by using a simple game-like application where participants were asked to
navigate a point through gates on predefined tracks. The tracks were presented using visual,
auditory or audio-visual cues in a three-dimensional space. The success was evaluated by

8.4. Avenues for future research

199

the number of gates found, the time spent searching for these gates, and the path length.
The results had a significant effect on the sensation of presence by means of audio-visual
cues compared to either auditory or visual cues.
In simulations, the main purpose of sound is to deliver information from the object in order
to increase the tangibility of the virtual system. The development and application of auditory feedback is not expensive and creates a compelling experience regardless of the quality
of the visual display. To ensure an authentic experience, it is important to define the direction and the distance from which the sound comes (equivalent to the visual feature of depth
created by luminance). The ‘illusion’ of directional sound can either be recorded or generated. This is achieved by recording sound for the left and right ears (using headphones) or
by presenting the user with sound sources recorded from the environment (using speakers).
Furthermore, additional features have to be highlighted, such as inter-aural delay, differences in amplitude between ears, the size, volume and characteristics of the environment
(e.g., masking the effects of furniture, noise pollution, etc.), the body’s occlusion of certain
frequencies, and the filtering processes of the outer ear. In addition, if the simulation training requires free head movements, additional signal-processing steps must be implemented
for compensation (Mazuryk & Gervautz, 1996).
Besides vision and hearing, another factor that has to be considered in simulations is touch,
encompassing the concepts of kinaesthesia (Mazuryk & Gervautz, 1996). Kinaesthesia is the
perception of the movements, muscles and joints of the body, while touch senses the skin’s
surface, providing the perception of temperature (i.e., thermoreceptors), pain (i.e., nocioreceptors) and pressure (i.e., mechanoreceptors). For simulation training, mechanoreceptors
are of most interest because they respond to vibration, skin stretching, velocity or flutter,
and skin curvature. To put this into context, haptic devices used in simulation training have
to be constantly stimulated in order to avoid sensorial adaption, and it is necessary to consider pressure detection (absolute threshold), location, type of stimulation, size of contact
field, stimuli frequency, and active or passive exploration. Similar to visual and auditory
cues, technological properties, such as fidelity, spatial and temporal resolution, latency tolerance, and size, have to be taken into consideration (Sherman & Craig, 2003, p. 180). Hap-

200

Chapter 8. Conclusion

tic devices were first introduced by computer mice and joysticks developed in the video
game industry to provide vibro-tactile feedback to the user. Ever since then, haptic devices
have experienced technological progression (Hayward, Astley, Cruz-Hernandez, Grant, &
Robles-De-La-Torre, 2004; Laycock & Say, 2003), including pen-based devices and gloves.
The application of haptic devices has so far been implemented in fields such as medicine;
Burdea, Patounakis, Popescu, and Weiss (1999), for example, used a pen-based device to
enhance the trainee’s skills at detecting malignant versus non-malignant prostate cancer.
The pen provided feedback to the index finger throughout the training session, and after five
12 min sessions, participants’ rate of diagnoses increased—compared to a control group—by
67%. Morris, Tan, Barbagli, Chang, and Salisbury (2007) compared haptic training, visual
training and visual-haptic training to memorising structured force patterns. Participants
were asked to recall a sequence of forces (72 trials, including a break after 36 trials) with 24
trial blocks for each condition. The analysis was based on the accuracy (i.e., force pattern)
as well as the time needed to recall the presented target (recreating a curve). A comparison
between each condition revealed that the most efficient recall occurred with visual-haptic
training, followed by visual and then haptic training.
The sense of smell is perceived by the biochemical and electrical signals transmitted from
the olfactory receptors and nerves, respectively, located in the upper part of the nostrils
(Zybura & Eskeland, 1999). Reaching the amygdala and the hippocampus, the signals are
evaluated in terms of: (1) an intensity estimation; (2) qualitative description; (3) a hedonic
tone. The intensity estimation evaluates the scent’s strength (and facilitates its localisation),
while the qualitative description refers to the odour detection. Needless to say, they also
depend on cognition, cultural background and past experience. The hedonic tone classifies
an odour as pleasant or unpleasant and is determined by concentration and intensity, as well
as cognition, cultural background and past experience. In contrast, the perception of taste is
processed by ‘taste buds’, ‘. . . [aggregating] 50-100 polarised neuroepithelial cells that detect
nutrients and other compounds’ (Chaudhari & Roper, 2010, p. 285). Though taste and smell
are sensed by different organs, their signals are perceived in combination (e.g., flavours,
food recognition).

Simulation, including the application of olfactory stimuli, is rather rare due to technological
challenges. Displays need to be adjusted in terms of fragrance density and distinction, adequate temporal duration of exposure, mixture of diverse fragrances after continuous usage,
and also personal characteristics (e.g., middle-aged individuals tend to have an increased
sensitivity to smell compared to their younger or older counterparts: Davide, Holmberg, &
Lundström, 2011). Thus far, simulation with olfactory displays have only been used as part
of an intervention study. This was, for instance, done by Kaganoff, Bordnick, and Carter
(2012). The authors assessed 49 heavy smokers classified by the DSM-IV by means of presenting nicotine cues for pre- and post-test assessments in the virtual environment. After
10 weeks of nicotine replacement, participants wore a head-mounted display and entered
one neutral and two smoking environments (i.e., ‘smoking paraphernalia’ versus ‘smoking
party’). In each scenario, participants had to fill out a Smoking Attention Scale (Hutchison
et al., 2001), assessing the degree to which they had the desire to smoke a cigarette. Olfactory cues were presented by the Scent Palette (Environdine Studios, Atlanta, GA), exposing
scents controlled by the virtual-reality software. While the neutral stimuli delivered scents
of fresh flowers, the smoking olfactory stimuli were a combination of cigarettes (smoking
paraphernalia) and raw tobacco and pizza (smoking party). The results showed that participants’ nicotine reactivity (i.e., increased attention and thinking towards nicotine cues)
was significantly higher during the two smoking stimuli compared to the neutral stimuli,
suggesting that olfactory stimuli using simulation can be used to assess and improve users’
smoking behaviour.
In the field of music performance science, future studies should investigate the benefits of
specific visual, auditory and haptic feedback in simulation training in order to enhance musicians’ performance skills, and also to increase musicians’ sensation of ‘presence’ (Tellegen
& Atkinson, 1974).11
11 The degree of presence was first examined by Tellegen and Atkinson (1974), who designed a questionnaire

attempting to measure the level of one’s absorption, defined as a disposition towards experiencing phases of
‘total’ attention in regard to perceptual, imaginative and ideational resources. The questionnaire assesses the
degree of openness to new experiences to a variety of different situations. People more likely to be immersed
show enhanced focus, are less easily distracted by objects or events, and are able to change focus based on the
situational requirements (Tellegen & Atkinson, 1974). This reflects the cognitive ability to sense and imagine
experiences and to alter perceptions through behavioural and biological adapted responses (Menzies, Taylor,

202

Chapter 8. Conclusion

The simulations in this thesis were tested to ensure that they are credible, appropriate and
effective. Specifically, I assessed the realism of the scenario (face validity). Nevertheless,
future studies that aim to develop simulation training for musicians should consider that
a realistic simulation scenario should contain an increased degree of interactivity, threedimensionality, accurate details (object projections), high resolution (fidelity), adequate sensory input and reactivity.
Only by encouraging researchers to address each of the points mentioned above will we be
able to determine the most effective way to train musicians using simulation training as an
educational tool for enhancing their performance experience.

8.4.2

Practical considerations

Performance stress and physical exercise

An interesting and relatively underdeveloped area of research is the impact of stress reducing interventions, such as physical exercise and musicians’ overall stress responses. Surprisingly, not many studies have evaluated the effect of physical exercise on musical performance stress, even though its benefits have been shown in other domains (Hamer & Steptoe,
2007; Klaperski, von Dawans, Heinrichs, & Fuchs, 2013, 2014; Steptoe, Kearsley, & Walters,
1993) and its application is straightforward and relatively easy to apply.
Physical exercise has been shown to benefit cognitive functioning (Carek, Laibstain, &
& Bourguignon, 2008). Tellegen’s absorption scale examines a variety of tendencies, such as ‘. . . (a) the responsiveness to engaging with stimuli, (b) the responsiveness to inductive stimuli, (c) imagistic thoughts, (d) the
ability to summon vivid and suggestive images, (e) cross-modal experiences (e.g., synaesthesia), (f) absorption
in thoughts and imaginings, (g) vivid memories of the past, (h) episodes of expanded awareness, and (i) altered
states of consciousness’ (Glisky, Tataryn, Tobias, Kihlstrom, & McConkey, 1991, p. 264). Studies that use the
Tellegen Absorption Scale have been predominantly applied in the medical field. For example, Kenny (2009)
administered the scale to evaluate how efficiently and believably clinicians experience interactions with a virtual patient based on a training programme. The results showed a moderate correlation between the Tellegen
Absorption Scale and the perception of virtual ‘reality’. Another study by Wiederhold et al. (2003) compared
physiological responses such as heart rate and skin resistance and the Tellegen Absorption Scale in a flight simulation. The study was part of an intervention and compared the effectiveness of simulation training amongst
phobic and non-phobic patients. Interestingly, the results showed that (a) phobic participants perceived the
virtual environment as more realistic than non-phobic participants, and (b) there was a significant correlation
between participants’ heart rates and subjective experiences of absorption.

Carek, 2011; Vancampfort et al., 2011), cardiovascular functioning (Blumenthal et al., 2005;
Hambrecht et al., 2003) and stress management (Brownley et al., 2003; Chafin, Christenfeld,
& Gerin, 2008).
Defined as ‘. . . participation in a program of regular, structured, physical exertion of varying degrees of intensity designed to increase heart rate and/or muscle strength’ (Edenfield
& Blumenthal, 2011, p. 300), two types of exercise exist: aerobic and anaerobic. Aerobic
exercise implies activities used with oxygen, such as brisk walking or jogging, supplying
the cells with energy. Anaerobic exercise triggers lactic acid formation, a process by which
enhanced metabolism of muscle glycogen occurs, building up muscle mass (Lippincott &
Wilkis, 2014). This is produced by a high intensity workout, such as weight lifting or sprinting. Aerobic exercise is especially believed to facilitate a cross-stressor adaption (Sothmann
et al., 1996), an increased tolerance towards familiar and novel physiological and psychological stressors. These adaptions are also assumed to reduce the sympathetic nervous activity
and increase the parasympathetic nervous activity.
Indeed, stress research overall confirms the positive effect of exercise on physiological and
psychological responses to stress; yet, it is still debated which type, frequency, and duration of physical interventions optimise physical and mental responses to performance
stress. Petruzzello, Landers, Hatfiled, Kubitz, and Salazar (1991), for instance, examined
in a meta-review the relationship between various types of anaerobic and aerobic exercises
(e.g., weight-training versus walking, swimming) and state and trait anxiety inventories
(e.g., Spielberger et al., 1983). He reviewed 104 studies, considering the categories: (1) exercise (aerobic vs. non-aerobic, duration and intensity of the exercise carried out), (2) design
of the study (pre-post-/multiple-assessment, control versus comparison group (e.g., meditation, relaxation), and (3) type of participant (age and mental health status). Based on 408
effect sizes and a sample size of 3048 participants, the results showed a significant overall
relationship between exercise and state anxiety reduction from pre-test to post-test interventions after aerobic but not anaerobic exercise. Both acute and chronic exercise was equally effective, yet, compared with other interventions, such as yoga, the effect diminished. Higher
exercise intensity (measured in %HRmax or %VO2max caused greater reduction in state anx-

204

Chapter 8. Conclusion

iety, while the time the state anxiety inventory was administered (<5 minutes versus >20
minutes) did not have an impact. In terms of exercise and trait anxiety, a significant overall response between exercise and anxiety reduction was observed, with again, a significant
effect for aerobic, but not anaerobic exercise. This outcome remained stable when other interventions were considered. Higher exercise intensity (measured in %HRmax or %VO2max )
carried out for at least 20 minutes produced greater changes in anxiety reduction, especially
in participants: (1) suffering from high levels of anxiety; and (2) between 31-45 years.
Long and Stavel (1995) conducted a meta-review where they investigated the effect of exercise carried out at least 3 times per week, 20 minutes in duration, over a period of six weeks.
Exclusion criteria were participants under 18 years and non-standardised physiological and
psychological measures. Inclusion criteria were: (1) experimental or quasi-experimental
studies; (2) within versus within-between subject designs (pre-test versus post-test; pre-test
versus post-test versus experimental versus control group); and (3) self-reports on state and
trait anxiety that fulfil psychometric criteria (e.g., reliability and validity). Twenty-six studies investigating pre-test versus post-test effects and 20 studies comparing exercise with
other interventions, such as yoga, were selected. The pre-test and post-test comparisons revealed: (1) a significant overall effect between exercise and anxiety reduction; (2) a greater
impact for higher than lower anxious participants; and (3) a greater effect for men than
for women. The effect of exercise on state and trait anxiety outcome was similar, with
shorter interventions (6-8 weeks) producing a greater impact than long-term interventions
(>12 weeks). Weekly sessions of between one and three sessions tend to be more effective
than more than three times though this could be linked to participant compliance issues.
In terms of exercise during contrast group assessments (between groups with pre-test and
post-test assessment), results showed: (1) a significant overall effect between exercise and
anxiety reduction; (2) a greater impact for higher than lower anxious participants; and (3)
greater results for men than for women. Shorter intervention (6-8 weeks) produced a greater
anxiety reduction than long-term interventions (>12 weeks), and weekly sessions performed
three or more times were more effective than those carried out less than 3 times.
Last, Conn (2010) examined the relation between exercise (e.g., supervised [educational or

8.4. Avenues for future research

205

motivational] exercise sessions) and anxiety reduction among healthy participants on a longterm basis. He selected 19 studies published between 1983 and 2008. Exclusion criteria were:
(1) participants with mental disorders; and (2) studies that did not measure the long-term
effect of exercise on anxiety. Studies were coded with regards to sample size, participants’
characteristics, methods, and type of interventions applied. Results demonstrated significant effects between physical exercise and anxiety reduction, while the time self-reports
were collected did not significantly change the anxiety outcome (<90days); however, group
intervention was significantly less effective than exercise on a one-to-one basis, as well as
when exercise was carried out in lower rather than higher intensity. The impact of exercise
on anxiety reduction was reinforced by supervised training compared with unsupervised
training, as well as when carried out in a gym rather than at home.
Based on these reviews, it can be concluded that exercise causes a noticeable, yet heterogeneous effect on anxiety. Such discrepancies were linked with variation in: (1) type, lengths,
and frequency of exercise; (2) exercise compared with other interventions; (3) age; and (4)
gender, with older and male participants experiencing greater benefit than their younger
and female counterparts.
In the musical domain, only Wasley, Taylor, Backx, and Williamon (2011) investigated musicians’ degree of physical fitness and its impact on performance stress; they assessed 46 musicians on two days, one week apart. During the first unit, height, weight, baseline heart rate,
blood pressure, state anxiety, as well as musicians’ perceived physical activity, were taken.
In addition, a cycling test at 60, 90, and 120 Watt was conducted. The index of physical fitness was expressed in VO2max , known as the maximum rate of oxygen consumption during
gradually increasing exercise. In the second unit, musicians performed in front of a jury
with the possibility to win a prize based on the performance quality. Scheduled 20 minutes
prior to the performance, musicians’ blood pressure was taken 15, 10, and 5 minutes before
the performance, while ECG was monitored throughout. Subjective feelings of anxiety was
assessed before and after. Results showed that musicians ranged ‘normally’ on the BMI index and did approximately 210 minutes of moderate to vigorous sport per week. Anxiety,
heart rate and blood pressure were significantly elevated during the pre-performance pe-

206

Chapter 8. Conclusion

riod in the high-stress condition, though no specification of the outcome between the three
measure point (15, 10, and 5 minutes) was provided. The degree of fitness was positively
correlated with heart rate (variability), while a negative correlation between fitness level
and state anxiety occurred. Fitter musicians exhibited a more pronounced decrease in state
anxiety during the post-performance period, suggesting an association between fitness and
psychological recovery.
Musicians need to have excellent commands over their physical and mental skills in order to deliver an adequate performance. This requires a sufficient state of physiological
and psychological health and wellbeing. Future studies should employ simulation training
and physiological signal processing methods in combination with physical exercise as an
intervention to reduce performance stress before, during and after the performance. The
simulation developed at the Royal College of Music would be an ideal platform to assess
its benefits in a standardised and controlled environment. Educational institutions, such as
conservatoires, should therefore be encouraged to supply musicians with specifically tailored physiological and psychological screening tests in order to identify adequate training programmes that address and improve physical endurance towards performance stress.
(Ginsborg et al., 2009).

Performance stress and Alexander Technique

Performance stress and the application of the Alexander Technique is another valuable
prospect for further research in performance science. Compared to physical exercise, the
Alexander Technique is a well-established part of conservatoire’s educational programmes.
Nevertheless, the benefits of the Alexander Technique are yet to be fully understood, especially when aiming for the reduction of performance stress.
Thus far, the Alexander Technique is known to be a re-educational approach that has a long
tradition in music education. It is supposed to improve the balance between body, mind and
the emotions and thus an ideal tool to work on performance stress (Kleinman & Buckoke,
2013). By applying principal guidelines based on self-observation, the Alexander Technique
has been applied to a variety of other health conditions, such as chronic back pain, respiratory problems, or mental tension.
An early study that investigated the benefits of Alexander Technique was carried out by
Austin and Ausubel (1992). They evaluated the impact of Alexander Technique based on
self-reports and respiratory functioning. Fifteen Alexander Technique teachers recruited
one of their students without respiratory problems, no smoking history, and standard body
weight. As a pre-test-post-test-comparison, a spirometer, measuring the volume of air expired/inspired was applied twice seven months apart. Results showed a significant improvement of respiratory muscular strength (e.g., peak expiratory flow, maximal inspiratory/expiratory mouth pressure) and endurance (i.e., maximal voluntary ventilation), while
such increase was not observed in the control group.
To strengthen these outcomes, Little et al. (2008) did not only examine the impact of the
Alexander Technique on subjective physiological improvement to no treatment, but also in
contrast to other interventions, such as massage therapy or Alexander Technique alongside
with aerobic exercise. A sample of 579 participants with chronic or recurrent back pain was
assigned randomly, receiving either six sessions of massage (n=147), 24 Alexander Technique lessons, or six lessons of Alexander Technique (n=144). Half of each group was ran-

208

Chapter 8. Conclusion

domized to prescribed aerobic exercise—behaviourally counselled by a medical team. The
subjective perception of physiological improvement was measured by the Roland Morries
Disability Questionnaire (Roland & Fairbank, 2000). Results revealed a significant positive
effect for both the Alexander Technique group and the Alexander Technique intervention
in conjunction with aerobic exercise, while no improvement was observed for the massage
therapy.
Cacciatore, Gurfinkel, Horak, Cordo, and Ames (2011) collected not only self-reports, but
also objectively compared the postural tone between Alexander Technique teachers (n=14)
and a control group (n=15). They also investigated the impact of 10 weeks of 45-minute oneto-one Alexander Technique sessions in participants with lower back pain (n=8). Results
demonstrated Alexander Technique teachers—compared to their control group—exhibiting
greater flexibility in postural dynamic by a lower torsional resistance to rotation (peak-topeak, phase-advance, and variability of torque) compared to the control group. The positive
effect of Alexander Technique was also shown for the intervention group, having led to a
decreased trunk and hip stiffness. Reddy et al. (2011) investigated alongside changes in
poster, respiration heart rate and blood pressure. Seven participants received two Alexander Technique group sessions as well as six, 45-minutes, one-to-one lessons. Self-reports
included the perception on respiration and ergonomic quality. Results demonstrated a significant improvement not only of perceived respiration and body alignment, but also in
monitored resting respiratory rate and peak inspiration chest circumference. However, no
other significant changes (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure) were found.
In the musical domain, Alexander Technique was first applied by Barlow (1956), photographing 50 students at the Royal College of Music from the front, side and back before
and after half of them received Alexander Technique lessons (no indication of the amount
or type was given). The posture was defined by 5 categories: excellent posture (‘0-3’); moderate to severe defects (‘4-9’); severe defects (‘10-14’); and gross postural deformities (>14).
Results showed an average decreased postural fault from 9 to 4 in female and from 11 to 5
in male students. However, neither a detailed protocol on the approach used was provided
nor were statistical analysis carried out.Jones (1972) applied Alexander Technique by adjust-

8.4. Avenues for future research

209

ing the neck position in a singer while being audio recorded. A subsequent spectral sound
analysis showed a greater richness in overtones as well as improved breathing patterns before and after the postural re-education. A peer student audience’s feedback supported this
effect, albeit this study only represents a case study and needs further verification with a bigger sample. Bosch and Hinch (1999) documented each step of their un-supervised treatment
sessions in two flute players suffering from shortness of breath, lower back pain, and tension
in shoulders and neck. Although no statistical analysis was carried out, they emphasised
that Alexander Technique ‘. . . [may have] bodily and spiritual benefits . . . [and] . . . positively
effect one’s whole life’ (Bosch & Hinch, 1999, p. 51). Brandes and Dionne (2008) determined
the effect of Alexander Technique in a secondary school choir after eight 20-minute lessons
over a period of six weeks. Semi-structured interviews, observational notes as well as two
videotapes assisted the analysis. Results demonstrated an expanded awareness of (the interconnection between) body and mind, as well as noticeably elevated energy—all of which
was reported to be attainable with minor effort. These results, however, were not backed up
by any objective or physiological measures making the work open to many criticisms i.e.,
participant bias.

In terms of Alexander Technique sessions and their impact on the reduction of performance
stress, only sparse evidence exists. Valentine, Fitzgerald, Gorton, Hudson, and Symonds
(1995) randomly assigned 25 music students to either 15 Alexander Technique lessons or a
control group. Questionnaires administered were the Performance Anxiety Inventory (PAI:
Nagel, 1990), the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI: Eysenck & Eysenck, 1964), the Mood
adjective checklist (Nowlis, 1965), and the Anxiety Self-Statements (Craske & Craig, 1984).
In addition, they were asked to rate their degree of interest in having Alexander Technique
sessions (1=‘Prefer not’ to 4=‘Very interested indeed’). Musical sessions assessed included:
(1) an audition; (2) a final recital; and (3) two performance classes—one held before the treatment and one after, including a performance in front of peers and their teacher. Heart rate
was monitored (at 10-second intervals) two minutes before each session. Results showed a
significant relationship between neuroticism and the wish to attend to Alexander Technique
sessions, and a significant improvement in the Music Anxiety Self-Statements as well as the

210

Chapter 8. Conclusion

Mood adjective checklist between the two performance classes while an opposite pattern
was observed for the control group. Nevertheless, no significant difference was found between audition and final recital. High-stress performances produced greater heart rate than
the low-stress condition, yet no main effect or interaction between groups was detected.
Furthermore, calculated standard deviations of the heart rate were greater for the control
group prior to the final recital, yet no difference between the two performance classes was
found.
Valentine and Williamon (2003) assigned musicians of different instrumental backgrounds
to either Alexander Technique (n=10) or alpha-theta neurofeedback (n=8). Alexander Technique training was carried out weekly, including 12 30-minute one-to-one units, while neurofeedback was conducted 10 times for 15 minutes over 6 to 8 weeks. The State and Trait
Anxiety Inventory-state form (Spielberger et al., 1983), was administered before and after
the interventions. Each performance was audio and video recorded and rated by two external experts (blinded to group assignment) in terms of head-neck-back relationship, use of
upper limb/back, use of hips/balance, direction of knees, face and eyes, breathing, fingers,
use of inhibition, overall impression, as well as the performance quality (1=‘Very poor’ to
7=‘Excellent’). Results showed a significant decrease in the State Anxiety Inventory before
and after the training in both groups. Furthermore, while the posture (head-neck-back relationship; upper limb/back; face and eyes; fingers; thought direction; inhibition and overall
impression) was significantly improved after the Alexander Technique, a decline was found
for the neurofeedback group. No difference in performance quality was observed.
Studies that have investigated the impact of the Alexander Technique on musicians’ performance stress response have shown moderate effects, with evidence exhibiting noteworthy
limitations: firstly, most of the studies only encompassed single cases (Bosch & Hinch, 1999;
Jones, 1972). While case studies offer meaningful insight into a research area where little
knowledge exists, it provides only a limited spectrum of meaningful insight as the results
are not applicable for valid generalisations. Secondly, many studies used qualitative methods only (Brandes & Dionne, 2008); the application of interviews are beneficial if researchers
want to find out more about the subjective perspective on a subject that is hardly explored.

211

However, similar to the case studies, it provides results that are biased through the lack of
more objective and generalisable methodologies. The Alexander Technique is holistic bodymind approach and thus, both physiological and psychological assessment tools should be
considered to understand the real impact of such intervention. In particular, future research
should be encouraged to carry out a close examination between the link of Alexander Technique and cardiovascular stress responses in response to different performance contexts.

Performance stress and mental skills training

Mental skills training (i.e., mental preparation) is the cognitive rehearsal of a performance
in absence of the physical movement and sound (Driskell, Copper, & Moran, 1994) and includes physical and mental relaxation (visualisation, reduction of muscle tension), attention
focussing, positive imaginary, self-efficacy statements and other forms of mental, physical
or emotional regulation during practice or prior to a performance (Williamon, 2004). It is
therefore an ideal tool to further investigate physiological and psychological performance
stress.
Music making involves complex cognitive elements (not unlike most disciplines in sport)
and the quality of output can be assessed objectively (Bernardi et al., 2013). Musicians
are encouraged to apply aural, visual, and kinaesthetic visualisation, as well as cognitive
(specific skills rehearsal) and motivational strategies (emotional regulation) that leads to a
performance sensation that similar to a real performance experience (Gregg & Clark, 2007;
Williamon, 2004). Thus far, Gregg and Clark (2007) were two of the first who aimed to discuss mental imagery in the musical context. Emphasising the successful implementation
of mental imagery training applied in sport psychology, such as the importance of cognitive (specific skills rehearsal) and motivational functions (emotional regulation), Gregg and
Clark developed an adaptive model for musical performance preparation, with particular
focus on the performance situation (rehearsal versus performance). For the musical context,
they identified several features to mentally prepare for a performance, such as the importance of practicing structured auditory imagery and performance confidence.

212

Chapter 8. Conclusion

Recent studies that addressed the efficacy of mental reparation in the musical domain stems
from Highben and Palmer (2004). They asked sixteen pianists to mentally rehearse four
novel 20-minute pieces over ten practice trials. The practice trials included: (1) normal practice; (2) practice without auditory feedback (sound turned off but still pressing the keys); (3)
practice without motor feedback (not pressing the keys but hearing a recording of the piece);
and (4) mental practice in the absence of auditory and mental feedback. Results showed that
the removal of any feedback lowered learning and memory abilities, and that normal practice provided the most efficient performance outcome. In addition, pianists who possessed
greater aural skills were less affected by the missing feedback during practice than those
without.

Clark and Williamon (2011) assessed mental preparation through the lens of self-regulated
learning behaviour and compared mental training between an experimental and a control
group and its impact on anxiety (Spielberger et al., 1983), self-efficacy (Ritchie & Williamon,
2011) and performance quality (overall quality, technical proficiency, musical understanding, communicative abilities, etc.). Twenty-three music students volunteered for this project,
with 14 assigned to the experimental group and nine to the control group. Students completed questionnaires on self-regulated learning (Zimmerman, 1998) and their perception
of musical skills (Ritchie & Williamon, 2011) and mental skills (Sheehan, 1967). The intervention was carried out over nine weeks, including one 60-minute group session and one
30-minute individual training unit per week. During these session, awareness was raised
for the topics: goal-setting, effective practice (performance preparation/analysis) and time
management, relaxation strategies and self-talk, mental imagery, focus and concentration, to
name but a few. The results revealed a significant improvement in musical learning and selfregulation and in the ability of mental imagery compared with the control group. Likewise,
self-efficacy increased, while no significant changes in state and trait anxiety was reported.
In another study, Clark et al. (2014) could demonstrate that musicians, in order to achieve
a successful performance through mental preparation, emphasis on the imagination of specific performance features, such as sound, physical execution and musical expressivity, but
also a sufficient ‘performance-sensation,’ musicians define through an increased control over

8.4. Avenues for future research

213

performance anxiety and outcome.
Bernardi et al. (2013) assessed mental practice and musicians’ progress on music memorisation using mental practice strategies of individually preference. Sixteen pianists were
asked to memorise two pieces by applying either physical practice or mental practice. Performances were evaluated in terms of correctness of notes, articulation and phrasing, dynamics and expressions, and via a global performance quality score. Results showed an improved musical learning using mental practice as well as mental practice alongside physical
practice, which was also supported by the external performance quality ratings (inter-rater
reliability=.58-.79).
Last, an extensive evaluation of mental skill preparation was carried out by Osborne,
Greene, and Immel (2014). In particular, the efficacy of the performance success programme
by Greene (2002) was put under scrutiny.12 Osborne et al. (2014) asked thirty-one classical music students to attend to training sessions twice a week over a three-weeks course,
followed by one week instrument-specific training. During the course, musicians learned
how to effectively reduce performance anxiety, to achieve their personal performance goals
and to acquire seven performance-enhancing strategies based on the performance success
model. To evaluate the benefits of the program, musicians completed a performance skills
inventory (also developed by Greene) before and after the intervention. The results revealed
substantial improvement in the ability to learn, to apply positive self-talk habits, to confront
fear, to get mentally quiet and to concentrate on demand. Conversely, no improvement was
observed for energy regulation and performance anxiety reduction.
Mental skills training encompass the successful rehearsal of cognitive tasks, such as conducting a formal analysis of the score, to listen to recordings and to develop an auditory
12 Based

on eleven performance success strategies drawn from different performance domains, Greene considered four essential preparation strategies: (1) the identification of a clear goal (e.g., performance outcome);
(2) an increased body awareness to reduce tension tendencies and the channel of body energy to facilitate
perform-readiness; (3) efficient breathing techniques (e.g., abdominal breathing instead of chest breathing to
release tension and facilitate relaxation); and (iv) conscious attention shift away from the left brain hemisphere,
which is a ‘. . . major obstacle to achieving the mental quiet necessary for optimal performance [. . . ]’ (Osborne
et al., 2014, p. 7). Thus, specific performance success strategies ranged from the ability to centre and control the
performance energy through positive self-talk habits to the empowerment of performance confidence, courage
and resilience.

214

Chapter 8. Conclusion

imagine of the repertoire and physical movement involved (Köppel, 1996). Like the Alexander Technique, mental skills training is a body-mind approach (Williamon, 2004) and should
therefore assessed in a holistic framework. This should include a weekly programme that
allows for a thoroughly preparation of musicians’ mental skills and the application of both
simulation training and physiological assessment to evaluate the impact of mental skills
training on both the musicians’ body and mind.

Performance stress and self-regulation

Another interesting approach to reduce performance stress is the concept of self-regulated
learning. Music making is an activity with high physical and mental demands (Clark &
Williamon, 2011) and it is therefore increasingly important to recognise how musicians can
maintain a healthy physical and mental state in order to secure a lengthy career. A critical stage in a musician’s development occurs during higher education (e.g., conservatoire)
where they train and prepare to enter the musical profession. In these surroundings, musicians usually practice thousands of hours to achieve a skill set that is similar to mastery
levels (Ericsson et al., 1993). However, while the time and amount of preparing has certainly received been subjected to increased scrutiny, noticeable less work has been done in
understanding how to recommend musicians to prepare effectively and thus, reduce the
likelihood of experiencing performance stress (Williamon, 2004).
Practicing is the most common activity of musicians during and beyond their musical education (McPherson & McCormick, 2006). Practice involves a combination of effective training
strategies, such as skill acquisition, developing and performing repertoire, techniques (e.g.,
scales, etudes) and musicianship (e.g., improvisation, sight-reading: Klickstein, 2009). This
has been shown to be best achieved through the concept of self-regulated learning, defined
as activities that include ‘self-generated thoughts, feelings, and actions for academic goals’
(Zimmerman, 1998, p. 73). Self-regulated learners show an enhanced participation in metacognitve and motivational strategies by means of applying specific, personally adapted, and
proactive processes that are tailored-made to the given task. Research reveals that the con-

8.4. Avenues for future research

215

cept of self-regulated learning includes six important dimensions for a successful performance outcome, including motive, method, time management, behaviour, physical environment, and social factors (McPherson & McCormick, 2000; McPherson & Thompson, 1998).
Investigating these aspects research could, in general, demonstrate that ‘. . . strategic, purposive, and reflective approaches to practicing are: (1) likely to develop over a long time; (2)
motivated primarily via intrinsic sources, and (3) more likely to yield performance competence’ (Miksza, 2011, p. 323).
Research investigating the link between self-regulation and musical performance and learning has demonstrated quicker skills acquisitions, a greater motivation to practice and overall better performance outcomes. Williamon and Valentine (2000), for instance, conducted
a systematic observation of twenty-two piano students while learning new repertoire. The
quality of the pianists’ practice sessions directly impacted on their final performance assessment and was independent of the amount of time spent practicing. Similarly, McCormick
and McPherson (2003) asked musicians about their motivational and self-regulatory features of instrumental performance. The results showed that high musical achiever employed
more self-evaluation and mental rehearsal than low-achiever, and exhibited a greater critical
judgment of the success of their practice efforts.
Also, Hallam (2001) investigated the effect of self-regulated learning in novices and professionals by interviewing as well as recording their practice habits. The results suggest that
professional musicians demonstrate—compared to novices—much better meta-cognition by
spending more time on planning and evaluation. Miksza (2007) evaluated effective practice
behaviours, concluding that more strategic approaches resulted in better performance outcomes and, therefore, highlighted the importance of the development of perceptual skills.
Unfortunately, musicians often exceed their physical limits by intense preparation, overly
strenuous repetition, prolonged playing without adequate rest and lack of warm up (Zaza,
1994), often leading to an increased risk of experiencing performance stress. Such practice
behaviour not only impacts on the likelihood to develop severe practice-injury development (Guptill, 2011), but may also lead to psychological maladaptive reactions, such as an

216

Chapter 8. Conclusion

increase fear of failure and presence of performance stress (Ackermann, Kenny, & Fortune,
2011). Thus, while research has realised that the duration of practice is crucial for skill development, it is still the quality of preparation that remains central (Lehmann et al., 2007).
To develop and maintain a successful performance career, musical preparation is an indispensable part of performance enhancement. Effective musical preparation involves warmup, enough breaks, the avoidance of massed practice of the same musical content, and the
importance of stepping back from the instrument in order to apply aural, visual, and kinaesthetic visualisation that allows a performance sensation similar to practice (for more details,
see ‘Performance stress and mental skills training’). Daily exercise should be considered
to enable increased performance stamina and a general understanding of body and mind;
physically to prevent muscoskeletal injuries and mentally, to reduce performance stress and
facilitate an increased performance confidence (for more details, see ‘Performance stress and
physical exercise.’).
Thus, teaching self-regulated learning and making students aware of the advantages of applying these strategic, purposive, and reflective approaches to practising is, given the increased pressure and competitiveness in musical domain, especially relevant. As a consequence, teachers/educators should aim to encourage students to view their practice as a
self-teaching activity in order to effective learning. Future studies should therefore aim to
develop, alongside musicians and music teachers, a healthy practice schedule that helps
musicians to overcome the daily challenge of establishing a practice routine and to decrease
the experience of performance stress based on insufficient self-regulated learning strategies.
In particular, they should employ the dimensions of motive, behaviour and time management in order to help musicians become aware and improve their self-regulated learning
strategies by means of incorporating a practice tool musicians can use on a regular basis.

Performance stress and smartphone applications

Mobile phones are, unlike other devices such as laptops, almost always in our reach and
can be found either in bags, pockets or purse, making the user available at any place and at
any time (Klasnja & Pratt, 2012). According to the International Telecommunications Union
in 2012, across developing countries, the average person owns 1.18 mobile phones with
this number continuing to rise (Hebden, Cook, Ploeg, & Allman-Farinelli, 2012). Much of
this increase has been in smartphone ownership where there were more than 490 million
shipments of smartphones globally in 2011 compared to 300 million in 2010. By 2019, it is
expected to have 2,659.4 million smartphone owners worldwide. This growth has been concentrated primarily in young adults between 25-34. Each mobile phone contains sensitive
personal information, ranging from imagines of and text messages from friends and family to the track daily activities, such as meetings, emails or social network behaviour. The
increasing popularity of mobiles phones has led to development of a stupendous amount
applications to deliver, foster and sustain health-promoting intervention and behaviour in
an efficient and straightforward fashion. In particular, the result of smartphone popularity has led to the proliferation of smartphone software in the form of applications (‘apps’).
Apps provide a platform to create daily entries of behaviours, to monitor and plan around
these behaviours, and to make adjustments where necessary (Schwarzer, 1999).
Apps have been designed in a variety of settings with the aim to facilitate and maintain
self-regulatory behaviours in a novel way, reaching individuals en masse. In clinical health
care, for instance, apps have been utilised where patients with asthma are able to monitor
themselves, such as by keeping a diary of symptoms, and are afforded therapeutic feedback (Boulos, Wheeler, Tavares, & Jones, 2011; Franko & Tirrell, 2012; Klasnja & Pratt, 2012).
Arsand, Tatara, Ostengen, and Hartvigsen (2010), for instance, used focus groups, interviews, feasibility testing and questionnaires to develop a smartphone application as a selfmanagement tool for type 2 diabetes. The final application, called ‘Few Touch’, includes an
off-the-shelf blood glucose (BG) meter, a tailor-made step counter, and software for recording food habits and providing feedback on how users perform in relation to their own per-

218

Chapter 8. Conclusion

sonal goals. Twelve users with type 2 diabetes evaluated the app for 6 months. Results
demonstrated a high degree of user satisfaction and noticeable changes in attitude towards
healthy behaviour, such as changes in medication, food habits, and/or physical activity. For
this, the app was able to provide them with an efficient way to capture and analyse relevant
personal information about their disease noted.
In the sport domain, apps offer athletes the opportunity to structure, plan, and analyse their
training by monitoring and evaluating parameters, such as speed, power, and heart rate
(Kranz et al., 2013; Xu, Cheng, Zhang, Zhang, & Lu, 2009). Moreover, these information can
be synchronised and shared with their coaches, allowing for close assessment of training
progress.
To put this into context, Kranz et al. (2013) developed an application that introduces individualised exercise skill assessment (balance board training) by means of sensor data providing
real-time feedback. Participants carried out twenty exercises with the application recording
accelerometer and magnetometer data. Subsequently, they validated the application by user
feedback and quantitative information processing. The results showed that the quality ratings suggested an increased motivation and a positive attitude to reach a training goal faster
and that the automated skill assessment was as accurate and effective as standard expert
evaluations.
On a commercial level, apps have been devised to assist weight loss with information on
nutrition, physical activity, and calorie counting, and to improve dietary habits (Hebden
et al., 2012; Lee, Chae, Kim, Ho, & Choi, 2010; Lyons, Lewis, Mayrsohn, & Rowland, 2014;
Middelweerd, Mollee, van der Wal, Brug, & te Velde, 2014). For instance, Lee et al. (2010) developed and evaluated an interactive smartphone application that assessed nutrition intake
and exercise. The application records the daily calorie consumption for each meal, set up an
exercise plan and encourages healthy eating behaviour through an implemented quiz-based
learning tool. Results of users trailing the app for a period of six weeks showed a significant
decrease in fat mass, weight and body mass index compared to a control group, and 58%
agreement that the application was easy to use and the information provided interesting.

8.4. Avenues for future research

219

Overall, apps provide an ideal platform to create daily entries of behaviours, such as physical activities undertaken or healthy foods consumed from which they were then provided
with weekly summaries of their reports. This not only enables to subsequently monitor and
plan behaviours, but also to overcome detrimental habits and make adjustments where necessary. These apps have, furthermore, been shown beneficial and effective, largely because
of the widespread and increasing use of such dynamic technology and the potential to reduce intervention delivery costs. They foster self-regulatory skills such as self-monitoring
and planning, and permit a faster and more accurate assessment of ones own condition
(Macdonald, Kreutz, & Mitchell, 2012).
The currently applications available in music facilitate various aspects of musical learning
and preparation and are an ideal platform to target specific practice goals (e.g., tempo regulation during practice) and to encourage and increase musicians’ engagement using technology as part of their every-day practice process. The smartphone applications ‘pitch improver’13 or ‘Theta Music Trainer’14 , for instance, provide exercises and tasks to expand
on and enhance musicians skills to recognise scales, intervals and chords, to repeat simple
to complex melodies, to identify rhythms and to learn the basics of reading music. Both
apps function iteratively and therefore allow the musicians to adapt to their own personal
learning goals in a regulated manner.
For adequate musical preparation, the (1) the ‘Music Journal Practice app to log time and
beats per minute’15 ; (2) the ‘Practice Center’16 or (3) the ‘Sheet Music Reader piaScore’17
have been suggested as valuable tool to organise and monitor musicians’ practice process. To put this into context, (1) allows musicians to time and monitor their practice sessions through visual feedback (graphs) and to regulate their music making by an internal
metronome where musicians can set their personal tempo for each piece and view their
learning progress through a beat per minute-chart. The application furthermore enables to
keep musicians’ repertoire organised in folders by for instance composer and instrument,

to import and export the data by email and to share summary reports with others including teachers and peers; (2) offers the setting of a practice timer and a metronome tempo as
well as an audio and video recorder for immediate auditory playback and visual feedback;
and (3) equip musicians with the possibility to write down any notes in the score, offering
a choice of pens of 3 sizes and 6 colours, as well as an easy stamp input. It also includes
a virtual keyboard, a chromatic tuner, a music player (iTunes) and a voice recorder, and allows sending email with the writing down notes, making it a useful tool for both practice
and teaching purposes.
The currently applications available facilitate various aspects of musical learning and preparation and are an ideal platform to target specific practice goals (e.g., tempo regulation during practice) and to encourage and increase musicians’ engagement using technology as
part of their every-day practice process. However, while these apps accommodate students
needs to enhance specific musical skills, to sufficiently plan and time their practice sessions
and to keep track on and organise their musical repertoire, they do not address or integrate
the importance of meta-cognitive skills such as critical thinking and self-evaluation to reduce
performance stress. To improve musicians’ practice process, they should be encouraged to
identify when they work most effectively, to consistently monitor their practice efficiency
and to share and discuss their practice habits with like-minded. This is achieved through
individualised and personalised psychological and physiological feedback where musicians
are able to personally reflect on their practice progress as part of their every-day practice.
Thus, future studies are encouraged to develop a smartphone application that will primarily
be guided by conservatoires and introduced to students as soon as they join the institution
to ensure best chances of establishing good practice habits early on in their studies, and in
order to prevent the experience of detrimental performance stress. To encourage students to
use it, conservatoires might consider integrating the app as part of their curriculum, equipping young musicians with the data logged that could become part of a final assessment.
Another possibility would be to use it with instrumental teachers who would incorporate
the app when goal-setting with the student in the lesson, focusing for instance on the technical aspect of the students’ repertoire and the overall efficiency in achieving the set targets.

8.4. Avenues for future research

221

Once the app has been implemented, sustaining its use should be encouraged by principle
instrumental teachers who have been identified as those who first year conservatoire students rely heavily on for advice (Williamon & Thompson, 2006). Thus, integrating practice
apps as part of musicians’ practice routines by addressing some of the common practice behaviours associated with performance stress (Duke, Simmons, & Cash, 2009; Williamon &
Thompson, 2006) seems like the ideal way to encourage and establish healthy behaviours
for a successful, rewarding and sustainable career in a challenging profession.

Performance stress and optimal performance

The experience of performance stress depends on the interplay between physiological and
psychological symptoms, which either have debilitating or facilitating effects on the performance quality. A seminal study which focused on the relation of physiological arousal
and optimal performance, is that of Yerkes and Dodson, published first 1908 in which the
so-called Yerkes-Dodson law was introduced (Yerkes & Dodson, 1908). Also known as the
‘inverted-U hypothesis’, the law predicts the relationship between physiological arousal and
performance and suggests that too low/too high drive increases the risk of a poor performance.
The study has provided ground-breaking insight into how changes in physiology relate to
performance quality, and has since then been adapted by many other researchers, such as
Wilson’s and Roland model of reaching optimal performance (Wilson & Roland, 2002). In
doing so, they divided the causes of music performance stress into three parts; task mastery,
trait and state. For instance, depending on the mastery of the task, different levels of arousal
are necessary before a good performance can be achieved. Simple or gross motor activities
require a high level of arousal, while fine motor tasks need relatively less arousal compared
with broader tasks. Wilson and Roland (2002) furthermore refer the importance of people’s
personality and their environment (e.g., social support, trait anxiety, and self-efficacy) as an
impact factor on performance quality (e.g., people with high level of trait anxiety should
remain a low level of physiological arousal), as well as the type of situation and setting

222

Chapter 8. Conclusion

(e.g., rehearsal, performance, and audition). For instance, musicians’ with high trait anxiety
perform at their optimum with a well-prepared piece in a safe and low stress environment,
whereas musicians with low trait anxiety need more challenging settings to reach their peak
performance.
Another concept that attempted to understand the interplay between somatic and cognitive
anxiety is Hardy and Parfitt’s catastrophe model (Hardy & Parfitt, 1991). This model follows
the basic relationship of the Yerkes-Dodson inverted-U, with the exception that performance
quality—depending on the level of cognitive and somatic anxiety—suddenly, not gradually
collapses after reaching a critical point. It then demands some time to recover, suggesting
that a small subsequent reduction in anxiety does not really have an effect on the performance. More recently, they added another dimension to grasp the cause and experience of
performance stress including the important aspect of self-confidence. To exemplify, a higher
level of self-confidence automatically raises the tolerance level of physiological arousal in
the presence of cognitive anxiety, resulting in a higher ability to perform the task in a successful manner (Hardy, Woodman, & Carrington, 2004).
Martens et al. (1990) also considered the multidimensionality of performance stress, yet
proposed that while the relation between performance and somatic arousal are invertedU shaped, the cognitive anxiety reveals a negative linear relationship. Additionally, they
discovered that psychological and physiological symptoms may appear at different onsets.
While cognitive anxiety seems to rise hours, days, or weeks before the performance event,
an increased physiological arousal seem to occur and reach its peak only a few minutes
before a performance (McNally, 2002).
Most recently, the relationship between emotional state and performance has been discussed
by Hanoch and Vitouch (2004). Their model is based on the cue utilisation theory (Easterbrook, 1959), which, similar to the Yerkes-Dodson law, assumes emotional arousal and attentional processes to follow an inverted U-curve. Nevertheless, Hanoch and Vitouch present
a more complex interpretation by emphasising the Arousal Congruent Performance (ACP).
In doing so, they consider the task, the context, several types of arousal (e.g., sympathetic,

8.4. Avenues for future research

223

attentional, etc.) as well as distinct emotions (e.g., fear, anger, etc.) to result in a specific
physiological state. If, for instance, the setting, task and the emotional state during the preperformance period is in coherence with the appropriateness of the context, the performer
is said to be in the individualized zone of optimal functioning (IZOF) based on the work
by Hanin (2003). Hanin tried to describe, predict, explain and control the experiences of
performances by defining performance ‘. . . as a situational, multimodal, and dynamic manifestation of the total human functioning’ (Hanin, 2003, p. 3), which is dependent on four
interrelated dimensions: (1) the form (e.g., cognitive, behavioural, motivational); (2) the
content (e.g., positive vs. negative, task relevance vs. task-irrelevance, intensity [e.g., level,
range, zones]); (3) the time (e.g., topological vs. metric); and (4) context (e.g., situational,
interpersonal).
While the first three are referred to subjective (meta-) experiences, the latter two represent
the dynamic of these experiences. To achieve an optimal performance outcome, emotional
content and intensity should be low of discrepancy and should moreover fall within the optimal zones (and outside dysfunctional ranges [in-out of the zone principle]). Furthermore,
a successful performance is more likely when the emotional state is maximum enhancing
and minimum inhibiting. Consequently, a poor performance is defined by highly inhibiting
emotions, while an average performance leads to an equal balance of both. The relationship
of emotion and performance is dynamic and bi-directional, meaning that not only emotions
experiences prior to but also during a performance are determining, working on a continuous basis. In consideration of performance as a dynamic, complex, and psychophysiological
intertwined system, a precise assessment of performance anxiety and consequently interventions are offered (Kamata & Tenenbaum, 2002). Future studies should therefore not only
investigate the physiological alert state 5 minutes prior to the performance, but also evaluate hours and even days of musicians’ performance state before an upcoming performance
event, as well as use qualitative assessment tools to identify the musician’s optimal state of
functioning as proposed by the work of Hanin (2003).

Chapter 8. Conclusion

Conclusion

It is important to understand how to measure and interpret the psychophysiological experiences of musicians accurately, prior to and during performance, as well as to offer musicians the opportunity to train and enhance their performance experience and skills in an
efficient and effective manner. In this thesis, I was able to demonstrate that: (1) the preperformance period causes the highest physical alert state; (2) the low- and high-stress performance scenarios are distinctively different in terms of physiological and psychological
stress responses; (3) both standard frequency domain analysis and multiscale sample are
efficient in analysing physiological data; and (4) the overall results are in agreement with
the component process model proposed by Scherer (2009), which states that a higher sympathetic nervous activity is displayed in situation that involve an increased lack of control
(e.g., in the pre-performance period). Particularly, during the 5-minute waiting period, musicians have experienced an increased degree of uncertainty, which is assumed to have led
to the peak in physical stress response. Interestingly, the responses during the performance
were often similar to those of low-stress performances, suggesting that, once the musician
re-gained ‘situational power’, the performance has been perceived as less threatening.
In terms of the evaluation of the simulation training, the main findings show that: (1) the
simulations (virtual audience and audition) have been effective tools to train and prepare
performance skills; (2) physical and mental responses experienced in the simulated performance environment have been similar to those felt in real performance settings; (3) simulations have been acknowledged in terms of their key environmental features, such as stage
lights, CCTV footage and the presence of a backstage manager; and (4) simulation training
has been perceived as a useful tool alongside other training strategies, such as mental skills
training and biofeedback.
Overall, I have paved the way for future researchers to obtain an overall understanding
of the physiological responses experienced in musicians undergoing different performance
contexts. I have furthermore offered future avenues to study performance stress and simu-

Appendix A. Musicians’ perceptions of using simulation training

mance. . . but. . . it’s like an experience, so the second time I already knew what I was going
to do. . . and I was already in the state of mind that I was ready for that. . . so actually if I felt
nervous the first time I almost didn’t feel nervous the second time because I knew what to
expect so I controlled my emotions better. . . the setting. . . I don’t know. . . that one experience
helped me what I needed to do to overcome being nervous. . . in that specific setting.
FG 6: Yeah it was stressful because I also the fact that you are entering. . . and you know
there is no audience but there are clapping so you don’t know if you should bow. . . or
no. . . and then. . . everything else. . . you don’t know what to say. . . like thank you. . . you don’t
know. . . it’s just. . . so the first time was quite. . . I just didn’t know what was going to happen.
FG 3: With the audition panel I felt like connected. . . they spoke to you and I felt like I should
speak back [laughter]. . . but he is not there so you really don’t know what to do.
FG 7: And I think it is different for a singer. . . because I. . . couldn’t have a pianist. . . and you
never sing without a pianist. . . so that would have been an additional pressure.

How would you describe your experience using the simulation FG 9: For me I think the
second one was much worse [audition panel]. . . cause with the performance I. . . it wasn’t the
fact that I. . . that it was simulated. . . that it was. . . I think for me a concert is much unless it
is a quite stressful concert. . . just a normal. . . you know. . . normal concert. . . unless you are
playing in a orchestra something really exposed. . . or highly high pressure. . . if you have
got a solo concert I feel like I can control that better because people. . . people come. . . and
they enjoy it and if they don’t they don’t. . . but in an audition the outcome is usually. . . that
how you play usually determines something. . . while in concerts well if you don’t like my
playing. . . then. . . never mind. . . so it is not as stressful. . . so for me the second one. . . I felt
much more nervous while the first one I didn’t really feel that nervous.
FG 4: I think it was the spotlights in the first one [audience]. . . I don’t know why I just
I’d never had any thought about the lightening. . . it just had not crossed my mind. . . and
then. . . like you said [NAME]. . . before you go in an like being backstage. . . you were sort
of whispering to us. . . and I thought. . . is this actually a performance?. . . [laughter]. . . I mean

229
you go in and it’s that spotlight. . . and then you actually see people and it was. . . and after
a while it was fine. . . and I was a bit nervous but then after a while I started to settle into it
like I normally when I perform but it did actually feel like a performance because I got the
nerves and I got the anxiety and then I started playing and thought. . . alright it’s ok. . . I just
carry on playing. . . but I think it was the spotlight. . . for me. . . but this of sort it made it more
real. . . if it was just a room with computer generated people it would have felt less stressful
I think, but it was definitely the lightening and the mood.
FG 8: I think if we would have stayed longer in the backstage area I would have felt more
nervous. Because what happens with me is that become really nervous and when I go on
stage it always goes. . . so because I didn’t really have of that waiting around time I didn’t get
the chance to get nervous I think. . . So I mean I was. . . Before an audition I usually remain
nervous, the nerves don’t really goes way like in a concert. . . it usually goes when I start
playing. So for me the first one [audience] it wasn’t nervous at all because I didn’t have a
chance to get nervous when I know I usually do get nervous if you know what I mean.
FG 2: Actually the difference of setting didn’t have an impact on me. . . I didn’t actually
think this one is for a concert and this one is for auditioning. . . I just felt. . . you know for me
it was a performance and maybe it was my mistake that I didn’t make that distinction in
my head. . . so I could see how I would have reacted differently in terms of the situations.
But practically speaking I. . . it didn’t really make a difference for me. . . having a panel there
or an audience. . . the experience was sort of the same because it is always about controlling
the nerves. . . so. . . yes. . . [Interruption Interviewer: but for the first time you did feel more
nervous than for the second one?]. . . yes I was definitely more nervous. . . and I felt. . . you
know my hands are a bit shaky and memory slips and all that. . . so the performance had
nothing to do what I was expecting because. . . I thought. . . oh this simulation is going to be
fun and then I got there and I got nervous. . . and the lights. . . I got nervous. . . I think when I
saw the spotlights. . . it was lightening that really scared me. . . so yeah I had a big shock the
first time.
FG 4: But the second time to me I don’t know. . . because I was playing the same piece. . . it

230

Appendix A. Musicians’ perceptions of using simulation training

was a little bit like you I kind of felt like a second shot of getting it right. . . once I had the
experience once I knew what to expect. . . and I find it normally when I perform a piece
anyway once you have performed it once you then know. . . well you need to focus on that
and you need to focus on that. . . and that’s almost what it felt like. . . it was a second go with
it rather than. . . oh it is not an audience now it is an audition panel I didn’t really think about
that. . . it just felt like a second attempt. . . if you know what I mean.

Comparison to a real performance FG 6: Apart from the waiting around time. . . when
you actually go in there not really. . . other than the fact that you would normally have an
accompanist. . . that was a bit strange playing a piece that I was playing in a multi-class at
the same time and it was bit weird playing it alone and just thinking what am I doing. . . but
other than that no. . . I think the people were a bit strange because there was a person who
looked completely like [NAME] [Laughter]. . . and I noticed that I thought oh that person
look awfully like [NAME]. and then I was so focussing on that because the people weren’t
real but. . . that was complete weird.

FG 3: I think that there was a few shuffling noises almost made me feel calmer. . . because
I don’t think I was expecting noise from the audience. . . So I kind of expected the applause
but I wasn’t really expecting like that kind of real situation of a little bit of shuffling. . . you
know like them actually moving. . . but that almost made me feel calmer. . . for some reason
I don’t know. . . it made me feel more like they are human even though they weren’t. . . and
then with the audition panel I felt connected because they speak to you when you come in
and that you should speak back. . . . it’s makes you more kind of nervous when you walk into
a room and people just stare at you. . . and you just have to start playing. But the fact that he
spoke to you first even though it was a bit awkward you didn’t know what to say. . . thanks
or. . . it kind of put me at ease a bit more I think. . . it made it feel more like a real performance
because of that. . . which I think made me put more at ease than playing in front of computer
generated people.

231
Improving experience FG 2: I think it is hard to do and it probably can’t be done but
it would be useful if the room was bigger because we are not. . . we don’t in this little
spaces. . . so when the room is bigger the stage is bigger and you feel exposed. . . you feel
like you are actually performing.
FG 5: Yeah this is it as well as you were saying . . . ideally for pianists it would be interesting
if we could have a grand piano. . . because it stupid. . . we never have like that in an actual
performance. . . you would have an open space and you could look at the people instead of
starring at a black wall. . . so it is quite a difference in terms of our performance. . . because of
the instrument we use.
FG 3: Maybe if you left people alone in the backstage area on their own. . . because sometimes
you have to wait around a while before you go off and for me it was quite quick so. . . it
would have good to have more time. . . because this makes me really nervous.
FG 9: Yeah if we going to have like 5 minutes to warm up or something. . . play a few notes
or something. . . that’s usually the scariest bit. . . if something is not going quite right and you
feel oh no. . . like it is not. . . so that’s when you start to think about and get more nervous I
think.
FG 1:

Well the backstage manager. . . it happen right. . . at least to have someone

there. . . because usually there is always saying ok are you ready in like 5 minutes. . . and
you think. . . oh yeah. . . right.
FG5: If maybe if you go into the backstage bit and you go in and set up like a stage manager
normally does. . . and leave the performer for sort of a couple of minutes and then come
back. . . and say ok everything is set up and ready. . . because I think that’s the bit where
I would get nervous is where you sort of wait and then someone goes on and starts to
moving all the stands and then in your head you go: have they put the stand on the right
place. . . have they done this have they done that. . . and then they come out say right you
ready and you go. . . no. . . no I am not. . . I think that’s the scary bit I think. . . to sort of give
the impression of someone setting up the stage and then come out and say you are ready.

232

Appendix A. Musicians’ perceptions of using simulation training

Possibility to use the performance simulator for what would you use it? FG 2: I think I
would use it to change my maybe my performance day routine. . . like really have a routine
which is every day the same. . . like what I eat and when I wake up. . . when I warm up how
I warm up for everything. . . so yeah I would probably try to work on these performance
conditions. . . if I could use this every day to.

Do you think anything would change in your reactions if you tried it out more often?
FG 9: Yes, because if u know the place where u perform well where you feel most secure. . . if
you had this routine and you perform this routine in this particular place you feel more
comfortable. . . it is juts about knowing things. Knowing space knowing what’s happening. . . helpful.
FG 6: I think if you used it a lot. . . eventually it would unconsciously get an idea in your
head that they are not actually real and they are not reacting to what you are doing. Like
the audience don’t give any reaction and can’t really change what you are doing. . . based on
what feedback you are getting. . . and I think if I used it enough eventually it would sort of
stop having an effect on me. . . it would stop being useful because you would sort of getting
used to it while in areal performance you never going to have a real audience and there will
always be some sort of reaction that you get from them. . . and that’s different. FG 1: It is quite
interesting because you talk about audience and people being in the audience and I didn’t
like notice any person in the audience and I didn’t notice sounds from the audience. . . I mean
when they talked to me [audition] I listened to it but then I didn’t notice that.
FG 7: I think it would be quite good to use. . . not frequently. . . but you know when you are
performing and someone mobile phone goes off or something happens that really or even
distracts you or it kind of makes you think oh just something happened and I think that’s
why I would like to use it. If you could make the audience almost as distracting as possible
so that you can carry on. . . and I don’t know you probably would get used to it if you used
it for a long period of time but it’s like it would be a really good idea to almost put yourself
in the worst possible situation so that if ever something slight happens it would not effect

233
what you are doing. . . I think that’s why I’d like to use it if it is possible to do that. . . if you
think if you can sit through that you can sit through anything.
FG 8: Yeah I think that along with a piece that is a bit scary or you haven’t played it for a
long time that would be quite useful. . . something that you are quite unsure about but if you
did it once you know what to expect and when it comes to the real thing you know.
FG 5: I think for the first time it would be best to be nice, but I think once you done it once
it just gets you think about ok I can do that and then if it happens in a real life situation then
you might not expect it. . . but it’s fine because you might have experienced it before. . . it
about having the mental thing even if. . . I don’t know. . . having done it once just to an audience even if they are not real someone to audience that just completely distracts you. . . I
think then if it ever happens then you would think. . . no I am fine I have done it before. . . I
think that would be handy. . . I suppose like you said with the difficult piece I think it is quite
hard. . . almost use it as a test to see how far it could go. . . because I think that would help
nerves as well. I would say.

Expectations FG 1: It made me more nervous not knowing I think when I because I
thought it is just a simulation it is going to be fine and I kind of took that frame in my
mind and when in. . . but when I went in I got really nervous because it wasn’t what I really
expected. . . so I think maybe the first time it is better to have that kind of not knowing because you don’t go to a performance when where you instantly how u feel. . . but its kind of
the feeling if you have done it once then it gets you thinking of how you would use it. . . I
think not telling us was better. . . for the first time.
FG 5: I would not necessarily agree because for me I. . . although the first time I did think it
was not real I don’t get as stressed as generally as with auditions. . . I think maybe I was a
bit a nervous and I don’t know whether this was because I was actually performing or just
because I didn’t know what was going to happen because when I perform I like to know
what the venue looks like. . . I usually go and try and see it beforehand. . . so for me I can’t
really distinguish whether the nerves where from the performance or not really knowing of

234

Appendix A. Musicians’ perceptions of using simulation training

what is going to happen. . . so I don’t really know. . . for the second time I can definitely say
it was because of the performance because I knew what was going to happen really. . . but I
don’t really know if I was nervous because of the performance or because of the situation?
Which was not. . . I don’t want to say it was not useful because all about learning and controlling the nerves is all good practice. . . but it was not the same as a performance if you
know what I mean. . . I don’t know whether it was the nerves. . . the performance or just the
situation. . . which is a bit of a different thing really.
FG 2: On the other hand. . . sometimes just before the performance something happens and
u don’t know what u can expect because they told u ion the last minute they had to change
the instrument and you don’t know the instrument at all and there is something unexpected.
FG 7: Yeah and even if you see the venue and rehearse the venue I never feel the same as
when you are backstage the audience get in and you have to get in. . . it feels like a completely
different environment to me because the whole pressure has changed. . . I don’t know so for
me not knowing was fun because I know the room how big the room was but I just didn’t
know how it was going to be set up. . . and sometimes you don’t if you go into a concert.
FG 1: I think what could be helpful is to move the hour of performance. . . evening it is
usually when you have to perform and you have thoughts about it during the day.

Use of simulation training. FG 2: It would be quite good if we could watch us back what
has been recorded and if we could watch it at home. . . so u can notice things u wouldn’t
normally now and you teacher could go through after that I don’t know.
FG 7: The problem is at least for me is that I felt awkward bowing whilst I am in a concert
situation I don’t feel awkward bowing but in that situation I felt a little unsure so I don’t
really know watching it back. . . it would be useful in some respects but I felt awkward and I
then probably looked awkward but I think it depends on the person. Because if u do suffer
from anxiety I think it would be a really good thing because it does feel like as if you were
performing and it does get up all your nerves it sort of teaches you well it helps you to
control them I suppose the more u did it. . . but then in some respect for me personally it

235
would be good to have a really horrible situation where you have to do it cause u know it
is not real but still provoking that feeling. . . but obviously watching it back would be good
because I felt awkward in that situation and I didn’t really feel like I was bowing to an
audience I was feeling I was bowing to a wall effectively. I am not sure if it would help me
with my performance how I act in stage or not.
FG 5: Actually I would not involve a teacher in the process. . . cause I think because it is
stressful enough to go to the teacher and play so I don’t think I would involve teaching In
this I think I would have more of a personal experience for instance on the first occasion I
played a piece that I never played in class before and I had a class on that day and I was
feeling quite safe about it and then I when I felt nervous I thought o after all I was not
prepared enough than I thought I was so actually that was very useful on that day because
I knew what I got wrong so actually the lesson went better on that day because I had the
experience in the morning. So I would definitely not involve a teacher because I think at
this stage it would be good to control your emotions because you know teachers are not like
when we are in high school it is much different.
FG 1: I don’t agree with the teachers thing because my teachers don’t really get involved
when I perform if you don’t tell them about the concert then they don’t know about it I
mean obviously you tell them but they might go over the piece a couple of times and if
they remember they say good luck. . . But they are so busy they can’t really go to a performance. . . they can’t really be at your performances. . . you sort of for me I just have to get on
with it and it is more the accompanist than the teacher that calms you down. . . we calm each
other down, so I think that having an accompanist would be better for me because in big
concert and audition that is the person who is going to be there.
FG 7: When you were saying when you did the audition panel the thing that actually might
be quite good is the teacher as the CTA person or someone or if you are doing audition for
an orchestra taking people from that orchestra that would just scares you more. That would
scare me with the head of each faculty [laughter]. That would have scared me a lot more
seeing him in the audience. When I practice at home I practice the piece thousands of time

236

Appendix A. Musicians’ perceptions of using simulation training

and a criticize myself and a I analyse everything but when I am with, my teacher I just let go
of everything and anything because I know when I am wrong she will tell me.so I think that
if I knew that she is somewhere and I know this is not a real performance I would feel kind of
like when I am in a lesson. . . so maybe it is not that good. But on the other hand. . . maybe it
is just helpful to have the recording of the performance and that show it to the teacher. . . but
I think I would not do it. . . so. . . I think I would become too.
FG 9: If I knew my professor was watching I’d start thinking ok am I playing this in the
right style, am I playing the right notes is my technique right, you know all of that would
go through my head rather than o I am doing a performance. . . so having it as a personal
experience is better because then I can actually think about the nerves the audience the
performance rather than like you said like feeling in a situation where I think I have to play
this right I have to do this. . . if that makes sense. . . it is a different way of looking at it as if u
had a professor behind you watching.
FG 4: I think it depends on the different teaching styles on how involved they are in the
performance because I have this audition coming up and I told my teacher and he so oh wow
of you want you can juts play it to me beforehand but it is not we are doing this audition we
have worked on this you have to do it like this more he is there to teach me what I want to
learn. . . but if I want to perform he gives me some advice and he leads performance down to
me if I want to come to him and say oh I am having problems with nerves or whatever then
he will help me but he is not so actively involved he just of sorts of waits for me to come to
him about performances rather than I know some teachers oh we have this master class this
weekend then there are they so it depends on the teacher. Because if they are there watching
your performance then it is as you were saying you think about different things and that
would be useful but they are not. . . Individual cases.

Use of simulation training FG 6: Like if I had an audition coming up and if you can the
situation and if you change the knowledge about It. . . as long as if u don’t get too comfortable
with it is can be useful all the time. . . as long as it’s stays fresh than it’s beautiful.

237
FG 3: If this distracting happens and if we are not aware what is going to happen I would
book it before an audition.
FG 5: A technical exam. . . that would be my main thing as soon as I get nervous. . . that would
be really useful. . . so that it completely puts u in this position and you fall apart and you.
FG 4: Safe in environment knowing that no one is there. . . safe space. To feel like you are in
the situation but there is no consequence.

What have you learnt? FG 2: I have realised that I rely on the audience’s reaction quite
a lot even if people look like they are enjoying it or not you can’ t know whether they are
enjoying it because they are not real, so you can’t really guide your performance based on
how they react because there is no real reaction. . . i have realised that I start performance
and then I glimpse off and I look at their reaction and if you see someone or a few people
looking a bit.
FG 5: I thought the first trail I realised that I wasn’t in a good place mentally to do the
performance so it is often for me to entering the stage and then when I finished then I was I
don’t know what happened whether it was good or bad I don’t know it just happened. . . but
the when I did it the other week I couldn’t I didn’t manage to change it but I learnt that I
have to work on it. . . And don’t know how.
