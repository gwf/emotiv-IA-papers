ABSTRACT Pain is a problem that has a significant effect on the quality of life, both personal and social,
and in the knowledge of the authors. To date, there is no practical device or method that allows us to
generate a quantitative pain index. In recent years, studies related to pain and its measurement have been
reported, which have used brain activity as a biological marker of pain based on various methodologies.
Therefore, the purpose of this survey article is to concentrate the tools and methods that use brain activity to
study two types of physical pain: 1) chronic, as a result of a clinical condition; and, 2) acute physical
induced by a painful stimulus. The survey analyzes the elements involved in evaluating these types of pain,
considering the number of subjects, the EEG setting, the stimulus applied, the pain perception test used, the
software for analysis and processing, and additional resources. The results present a systematic
classification of the information; it contains the techniques and technologies that have been used for the
study of pain. Finally, the article concludes identifying opportunity areas as quantitative pain measurement
tools based on brain activity analysis to understand, adapt, or monitor the treatment responses.
INDEX TERMS EEG Pain, pain measurement, brain activity, chronic pain, acute pain.
I. INTRODUCTION

Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience that
protects the body. It appears every time the subject injures
any tissue and causes the subject to react by eliminating (or
trying to eliminate) the painful stimulus. Three characteristics
define pain: time (acute and chronic), origin (nociceptive and
neuropathic), and location (somatic and visceral). For this
compilation, pain classification by time will be considered,
that is, acute and chronic. According to the International
Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), pain is associated
with actual or potential tissue damage. It is described in
terms of such damage but is considered a problem when it
begins to present itself chronically, which means, it persists
or repeatedly occurs in a period of three to six months with
no apparent cause. Moreover, another problem inherent to
chronic physical pain is the personal and social costs. One of
these costs is related to the reduction of quality of life due to
unsatisfied therapeutic needs [1]. Besides, there is evidence
that people with chronic pain decreased their daily
productivity because this condition generates depression and

anxiety [2]. In this sense, the World Health Organization
(WHO) recognizes chronic pain as a significant global public
health problem. In Mexico only, it is estimated that 27% of
the population suffers from chronic pain and in the United
States, 17% of the patients cared for in primary care centers
have chronic pain and, internationally, this health problem
affects between 25 and 29% of the population [3].
Although pain is treated using pharmacological, nonpharmacological, behavioral, and interventional techniques,
only 50% of patients in pain reported improvement. The
most common barrier to effectively manage pain is the
failure of health professionals to assess it and the
effectiveness of the used relief measures [4]. The tools
commonly used for the assessment of pain intensity (PI) are
unidimensional pain scales, such as the Numerical Rating
Scale (NRS), Verbal Rating Scale (VRS), or Visual
Analogue Scale (VAS) [5]. However, these estimation
methods are not sufficient because they only reflect on the
subject’s perception [6].

This worldwide problem encourages researchers to look
for non-subjective options. According to literature, one of the
physiological signal that offers adequate information is brain
activity and it is considered a biomarker [1], [7], [8]. Recent
studies report that chronic pain is related to the functioning
and structural reorganization in the nervous system, so the
activation of multiple areas on the brain generates a pain
matrix [9]–[11]. Moreover, recent experiments presented
evidence that brain function and behavior may be different in
individuals with chronic pain compared to individuals who
do not have any pain [8], [12], [13]. In response to painful
physical stimuli, brain activity shows a significant effect in
the electrocortical reaction [14]. Nowadays, the gold standard
tool to measure the potentials produced by the brain is the
electroencephalogram (EEG), which is defined as the noninvasive recording of the alternating electrical activity from
the scalp’s surface through metal electrodes and media
conductive [15]. Electrodes position on the scalp must be
based on the 10-20 system, which is a method to standardize
the recordings and be able to compare results. The term "1020" refers to the placement of electrodes in 10% or 20% of
the total distance between specific skull locations [16], [17].
The EEG is widely used to study the functioning of the brain
during rest, sensory stimulation, cognitive tasks, and even
with the psychological pain suffered by people with
depression [18]–[20].
The EEG is generated by a specific type of synchronous
activity of neurons known as pyramidal neurons. The
complex electrical output is thus reflected in the areas of the
skin where the electrodes are located. The different patterns
of electrical activity, known as brain waves, could be
recognized by their amplitudes and frequencies. The
frequency is measured by the number of waves per second
(Hz), while the amplitude stands for the magnitude of these
waves measured by microvolts (μV). The different frequency
components are classified into delta (less than 4 Hz), theta
(4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30100 Hz) [21].
Efforts have been made to consider evaluation methods,
considering electroencephalography as a tool to determine
how brain activity is related to pain and thus determine
objective, reliable, and quantitative indicators [22]. Silva,
Queirós, and Montoya [23] found that there is a general
increase in the potential of lower EEG signal frequencies in
patients with chronic pain at rest. Moreover, studies report
that activity in gamma waves is closely related to pain
compared to the response in other frequencies [14], [24],
[33], [25]–[32].

Studies of physical pain through brain activity using EEG
techniques have been developed from two perspectives. The
first one, considering the chronic pain where the study
included subjects presenting different types of physical pain
like neuropathic [34], [35], back pain [36], [37], sickle cell
disease [38], or pancreatitis [39]. The second one,
considering the pain to be induced by a different type of
stimulus, like tonic heat [25], [28], [29], or pressure
application [24]. Regardless of the origin of the physical
pain, the studies with brain activity had reported a relation.
However, the difference in EEG acquisition devices, the
number of electrodes, electrode placement positions on the
scalp, number of subjects, type of stimulus, device to apply
the stimuli or software to analyze the signal, made the
comparison of the results difficult. In the quantification of
pain through brain signals, not only the type and origin of
pain intervene but also the tools to obtain these signals are
also relevant. In this sense, this article’s objective is to
present a concentrate of information that allows researchers
to shorten the path in the selection of techniques for the study
of pain, based on the results obtained through the devices and
techniques used by other researchers.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II
describes materials and methods considering the search
strategies and selection of studies, as well as the process of
data extraction. Section III presents a summary of
methodologies for the study of physical pain through brain
activity considering chronic pain and acute pain approach.
Section IV presents the common elements and methods in
the study of pain through brain activity considering both
approaches, identifying the devices to acquire EEG signals,
stimulus application technology and technique, pain
perception test, additional questionnaires to assess the
perception of physical and mental health used besides the
software to acquire and analyze the signals. Section V shows
a discussion and Section VI includes the conclusions.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. SEARCH STRATEGIES AND SELECTION OF
STUDIES

The papers collection for this survey was carried out between
January 2018 and January 2020, managing a search approach
from general to specific. The general search began with the
use of the Google Academic tool; from which it was possible
to identify the databases with relevant studies to meet the
research objective. The keywords used in the general search
were: Pain EEG and Pain quantification EEG. Based on the
general search results, a more particular approach was given
searching more specifically at IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and
Science Direct. Based on the results of the specific search,

the following keywords were added: tonic pain EEG, pain
brain. The selection of studies was made considering the
following eligibility criteria: a) articles in English language,
b) articles published after 2010, c) brain activity is used to
study pain. The considered exclusion criteria are a) the
studies related to emotional pain, b) the study of pain
associated with neurological diseases, such as stroke,
schizophrenia, autism, or brain tumors. All studies examining
physical pain through brain activity were considered in this
survey, including the study of chronic pain and the ones in
which pain was induced.
B. DATA EXTRACTION

It was possible to identify a group of elements that every
researcher uses but proposing different methods to carry out
the study of pain considering brain activity. Table 1 presents
the group of elements identified in the studies.
Once the analysis of studies began, it was possible to
identify two types of pain, chronic pain caused by different
types of diseases and pain caused by stimuli, in which the
researcher must select the type and conditions of the stimuli.
After the analysis of conditions and variables presented in
Table 1, it was possible to identify some similarities and
differences in the use of techniques and technology between
these two perspectives of studies presented in Table 2.

Initially, the title and abstract data were extracted from 224
articles to assess its impact on the research purpose. From
those, 115 articles were considered relevant and were
examined in detail considering the context, problem,
objective, justification, and results, thus allowing an analysis
to be carried out considering the inclusion and exclusion,
finishing with 31 articles selected for analysis.

III. METHODOLOGIES USED TO STUDY PAIN THROUGH
BRAIN ACTIVITY
A. STUDY OF CHRONIC PAIN USING A BRAIN ACTIVITY
APPROACH

The study of chronic pain through brain activity considers
different variables to establish a correlation between pain,
brain activity, and other types of physical and mental health
indicators. Tables 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d summarize a group of
studies selected in chronological order, identifying the
technology and techniques implemented based on the data
extraction criteria presented in Table 1. The studies consider
chronic pain as a result of diseases like sickle cell disease,
fibromyalgia, back pain, pancreatitis, postoperative patients,
and one case considered for depressive disorder. Likewise,
according to the criteria defined in Table 1, ten reported
studies were found in which it is observed that, subjects of
both genders were studied with an age range between 18 and
85 years.

B. STUDY OF ACUTE PAIN USING BRAIN ACTIVITY
APPROACH

Considering the study of pain is significant to contemplate
that pain and nociception are not the same phenomenon.
Nociception refers to the peripheral and central nervous
system processes triggered by the activation of nociceptors
and pain is a subjective experience; one of the possible
outcomes of nociceptors activation [40]. Commonly,
nociception and the perception of pain are evoked only at
pressures and temperatures extreme enough to injure tissues
potentially and by toxic molecules and inflammatory
mediators. These high threshold physical and noxious
chemical stimuli are detected by specialized peripheral
sensory neurons called nociceptors. A nociceptor is a
peripherally localized neuron preferentially sensitive to a
noxious stimulus or to a stimulus that would become noxious
if prolonged, capable of encoding stimulus intensities within
the noxious range. It may have a wide dynamic range of
thresholds from innocuous to noxious but there is a stimuluspeaks response relationship in the noxious range. These also
include responses that are not activated immediately but the
body becomes responsive upon prolonged stimulation, such
as heat and mechanical stimulation [41]. Nociceptive stimuli
have been seen to provoke high-frequency oscillation activity
of the human primary somatosensory cortex and gamma
oscillations [24].

application of harmful stimuli to generate pain and thus
analyze brain activity. There are some advantages for
carrying out this type of study.
• The stimulus to be applied can be controlled by the
researcher. Therefore, a correlation can be established
between the intensity of the stimulus and the intensity of
perceived pain.
• The study can be carried out on a group of healthy
subjects.
Given the needs of this type of study, it is imperative to
carry out a careful selection of the type of stimulus, the
application medium, and the area of the body in which the
stimulus is going to be applied.
Another important variable that is considered in this type of
study is the use of a pain perception test, intending to
establish a correlation between the stimulus intensity applied,
the pain perception of the subject, and the brain activity
generated. The most common tools are the NRS and VAS. In
addition, these tools sometimes are used individually or
combined with other types of pain perception tests.
Tables 4a to 4e present a summary of studies of pain
monitored by brain activity when a stimulus is applied.
Although studies from the last ten years are considered for
the development of this research, the tables only present
studies from the last six years. Fifteen reported studies were
selected according to the criterion defined in Table 1. In
general, subjects of both sexes were studied, with an age
range between 18 and 59 years.

Taking into account the principles of nociception, many
researchers began to study pain associated with the

IV. COMMON ELEMENTS AND METHODS IN THE
STUDY OF PAIN THROUGH BRAIN ACTIVITY

From the selected studies, it was possible to identify the
device to acquire EEG signals, stimulus application
technology and technique, pain perception tool, additional
questionnaires to assess the perception of physical and
mental health, and the software to acquire and analyze brain
activity. These elements are presented below, describing their
main features.
A. DEVICE TO ACQUIRE EEG SIGNALS

The way of acquiring the brain electrical activity in these
studies is generally by the gold standard non-invasive EEG.
Then two studies that were analyzed for the survey were
excluded from Table 5, considering that the analysis of brain
activity was performed through MRI for which an 8-channel
BOLD-based fMRI [50] and 3 Teslas MRI scanner with 35
axial slices covering the entire brain was used [33]. Likewise,
another two studies [27], [46] were carried out with rats, even
though they used EEG recording. An invasive technique was
used because screws were the active electrode, considering
12 channels in one of the cases and 3 in the other.

One of the main elements to start with a study of pain
through brain activity is the selection of a device to record
EEG signals. It is worth mentioning that the selection of this
device will depend on the need for the study. However, a hint
that can facilitate this selection is considering the number of
electrodes to be mounted. Commercial devices commonly
handle the 10-20 mounting standard. Table 5 lists the devices
used in the selected studies, as well as the brand and the
number of electrodes used.

B. STIMULUS
TECHNIQUE

APPLICATION,

TECHNOLOGY,

AND

As previously mentioned, another type of pain study is
considered. The acute pain studies are the application of a
harmful stimulus in people with no disease. For these cases,
it is crucial to consider properly what type of stimulus will be
applied and the medium or device that will be used for the
application because it is not intended to generate any longterm harm to the participant. Table 6 presents stimulus
applied in the revised studies and the way the stimulus was
applied.
From this survey, it was possible to identify that at least
60% of the cases use commercial equipment to apply a
controlled stimulus. It stands out that 28% of the equipment
used belongs to the Medoc brand, which provides specialized
commercial equipment to evaluate pain from different
perspectives, such as research, clinical use, and clinical trials.
Another 28% of the cases used some type of laser to apply
heat stimuli. With a lower percentage, 14% used chemical

stimuli, such as injection of solutions or application of topical
capsaicin, another 14% used the application of electrical
stimuli, 9% applied pressure, and 9% used cold water
controlling the temperature.
Once the equipment to apply the stimulus is selected, it is
important to determine the part of the body where it will be
applied. From this survey, it was found that 38% of the
studies applied the stimulus to the hands (commonly on the
dorsum), 33% on the forearm (commonly on the volar
surface), 9% on the masseter muscle, 4% on the second
costochondral junction, 4% on the index finger, and
considering that two studies in rats were included, they were
applied to the paws. It is important to highlight that 42% of
the stimuli were applied in the left parts of the body, 28% in
the right parts, 19% in both parts of the body, and only 4%
considered the application in the dominant hand.

C. PAIN PERCEPTION TEST

D. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONNAIRES TO ASSESS THE
PERCEPTION OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH

As a common technique for the study of pain, several
researchers considered parameters extracted from the EEG
signal to establish a correlation with the perception of the
pain of participants. One-dimensional scales are used to give
a qualitative pain value experimented by the subject. The
reviewed studies use the scales either individually or in
combination.

Some
researchers
incorporated

questionnaires that identified information on the physical and
mental health of the subjects, in order to correlate these
variables with the perception of pain obtained and the result
of the brain activity generated as an additional source of
information. Table 7 presents a classification of the tools

D. SOFTWARE TO ACQUIRE AND ANALYZE THE
SIGNALS

An essential tool for studies of pain through brain activity is
the software through which the signals will be recorded and
analyzed, as well as the visualization and study tools. Table 8
includes a list of software and tools used for the acquisition
and analysis of brain activity.

software LORETA-KEY as free academic software.
V. DISCUSSION

With this survey, it was identified that there are two main
ways to study pain through brain activity: studies that
consider subjects suffering from some type of chronic
physical pain and studies that are based on the application of
some type of painful stimulus to healthy subjects. It should
be noted that similar elements are used in both studies despite
the possible difference in the origin or mechanisms involved.

Regarding the number of participants, there is no constant
to consider. Among the selected studies, it was identified that
the study with the least number was seven subjects [31], and
the one with the most subjects was 211 [12]. There is also no
constant regarding sex consideration in test subjects who are
part of the studies. Only one study was found where only
female test subjects were considered. In that case, it was for
the study of pain associated with fibromyalgia, and it is
consistent with other reports about a higher incidence in
females [42]. On the other hand, three cases were found in
which only male subjects were considered. These studies
were performed in healthy subjects to whom a painful
stimulus was applied [28], [48], [52]. Two studies were also
included in which the subjects were rats, and in that cases
too, only male rats were considered [27], [47].
Concerning the equipment to record brain activity, it was
found that 87% of the EEG signal acquisition equipment
used in the revised studies was commercially available and
there is no constant about the type of equipment used. As for
the number of electrodes used to record EEG activity, there is
significant variability. The study with the lowest number was
two electrodes [12]. In comparison, studies with the largest
number of electrodes use 128 [46]. Two studies considered
for the survey present analysis of brain activity using an MRI
for which an 8-channel BOLD-based fMRI [51] and 3 Teslas
MRI scanner with 35 axial slices covering the entire brain
[34]. Likewise, another two studies using rats [27], [47], in
which an invasive technique was used because screws were
the active electrode, considering 12 channels in one of the
cases and 3 in the other. This last technique proved to be a
valuable complement to understand the functioning of the
brain.
For the cases that considered the study of pain caused by a
stimulus, it was possible to identify that at least 60% of cases
use commercial equipment to apply a controlled stimulus, but
regardless of the equipment used or the type of stimulus
applied, similarities were found in the results regarding the
type of wave generated from the application of the painful
stimulus. Oscillations in alpha waves were reported as a
result of heat stimulation [44]. In the case of beta waves, an
increase was shown as a result of the application of cold as a
stimulus [25], [46]. The brain wave that most commonly
appeared independently of the stimulus was gamma because
it was presented when heat [26], [29]–[32], cold [25],
pressure [24], injection of solutions [28], and electrical
stimuli [14], [33] were applied.

Among the methods to analyze the signals, different tools
were identified that provide accurate results in which brain
activity can be used to monitor pain. However, there are
other methods that allowed the generation of satisfactory
results, like the methods presented in Tables 3a to 3e and in
Tables 4a to 4d. Among these methods, the ICA and the FFT
stood out. In terms of statistical analysis, ANOVA is a
widely used tool [14], [26]–[28], [30], [39], [42], [45], [48].
Considering brain imaging, the study presented in [51]
demonstrated that fMRI with SVM learning can assess pain
without requiring any communication from the person being
tested. On the other hand, the proposed approach by
Hadjileontiadis [49] contributes with an alternative way to
endeavor towards objective quantification of the subjective
characterization of pain, considering the no stationarity and
nonlinearity of the EEG-based brain responses to pain
stimuli.
Considering the complementary methods, the additional
technique of electrooculogram (EOG) was used to record the
biopotentials generated by the movement of eyes to exclude
trials contaminated with eye movements from further
analysis [11], [36], [39]. Another additional tool was
included in the SLBP patient testing protocol. A 25-minute
massage was included and the results suggested that the
complexity of EEG signals was reduced with the relief of
pain after the massage therapy, and the change of pain of
SLBP patients was closely related to the change of the
rhythms of the brain in the massage therapy. Besides, the
Approximate Entropy (ApEn) and the Hilbert-Huang
Transform Marginal spectrum entropy (HHTMSEn) features
could serve as a base for quantitative assessment of SLBP
condition after the massage therapy [37]. An interesting
challenge was presented by Kumar et al., [22] working with
patients in the Post Anaesthetic Care Unit (PACU). As a
result, the developed pain scale by analyzing EEG signals of
the patients in the post-operative period was correlated with
Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and was found to be accurate
to estimate the level of pain when compared to the pain
experienced by the patient.
In terms of the results obtained, it was also possible to
identify some similarities and differences in the results of
brain activity associated with pain. In a matter of results
obtained through the selected articles, it was found that the
activity associated with pain occurs mainly in the prefrontal,
frontal, and central cortex [14], [20], [25], [26], [28], [29],
[33], [38], [42], [47]. For the cases in which subjects with
chronic physical pain are considered, brain activity
associated with pain was found in the power bands: alpha
[39], [43], beta [11], [37], [43], delta [11], [37] and theta

[38], [42]. In studies where pain stimulus is applied, it was
found that the brain activity changes commonly regarding the
non-stimulus state in the gamma band [14], [24], [33], [50],
[25]–[32]. However, some studies report an increase in alpha
[44] and beta [25], [46].
VI. CONCLUSIONS

The objective of this article was to develop a survey
considering studies of physical pain through brain activity to
identify elements and the methodologies used in the last ten
years. Initially, it was possible to identify that pain studies
commonly address chronic pain caused by a physical
condition and acute pain caused by some type of stimulus.
For this survey, both types of studies were considered, and
elements involved in the evaluation of these types of pain
were identified, which are the number of subjects, the EEG
setting, the stimulus applied, the pain perception test used,
the tools for acquisition and analysis, and additional
resources.
From the variables identified, it is concluded that in order
to carry out a study of pain based on brain activity, it is
necessary to identify the type of pain to be studied, since the
requirements of the protocol to perform the tests will depend
on this. For the studies of chronic pain, it is necessary to have
access to a population sample with a chronic disease
condition and to have a control group of healthy subjects
with the same age range. In case of the acute pain study, it is
crucial to identify the type of stimulus, the application
conditions, and the part of the body where it will be applied.
The stimulus that is commonly applied is heat or cold by
thermode or laser; however, stimuli such as pressure and
injection of solutions are also applied, commonly in the
forearm or hand dorsum. Regarding the number of subjects,
it is concluded that there is no evidence of a minimum
number of subjects or sex to be able to develop a pain study.
Commercial equipment is commonly used. In this case, there
is no constant in the number of electrodes to consider but the
10-20 standard for electrode montage was used. For
processing and extracting characteristics of the brain signals,
Brain Vision and MATLAB are among the mostly used, but
both are licensed software. As perception evaluation, it is
concluded that the numerical scale of pain (NRS) is one of
the most used. Likewise, the use of additional questionnaires
for the perception of physical and mental health is
recommended.
In general terms, this survey shows that the technology for
the study of pain from brain activity is mature. There are
commercial software and devices to facilitate the work of

neurophysiologists. Likewise, there is congruence between
MRI with those of EEG and the results are showing that pain
is capable of generating certain patterns of behavior at brain
level, which is why the EEG is expected to be a pain monitor
(biomarker). Once the pain can be measured through a
biological indicator, accurate diagnoses can be provided to
patients, as well as effective physical therapy treatments can
be prescribed, resulting in costs reduction in a personal and
social way.
