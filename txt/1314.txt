Abstract
Background: EEG studies investigating the neural networks that facilitate action observation (AO) and kinaesthetic
motor imagery (KMI) have shown reduced, or desynchronized, power in the alpha (8–12 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz)
frequency bands relative to rest, reflecting efficient activation of task-relevant areas. Functional modulation of these
networks through expertise in dance has been established using fMRI, with greater activation among experts during
AO. While there is evidence for experience-dependent plasticity of alpha power during AO of dance, the influence
of familiarity on beta power during AO, and alpha and beta activity during KMI, remain unclear. The purpose of the
present study was to measure the impact of familiarity on confidence ratings and EEG activity during (1) AO of a brief
ballet sequence, (2) KMI of this same sequence, and (3) KMI of non-dance movements among ballet dancers, dancers
from other genres, and non-dancers.
Results: Ballet dancers highly familiar with the genre of the experimental stimulus demonstrated higher individual
alpha peak frequency (iAPF), greater alpha desynchronization, and greater task-related beta power during AO, as well
as faster iAPF during KMI of non-dance movements. While no between-group differences in alpha or beta power
were observed during KMI of dance or non-dance movements, all participants showed significant desynchronization
relative to baseline, and further desynchronization during dance KMI relative to non-dance KMI indicative of greater
cognitive load.
Conclusions: These findings confirm and extend evidence for experience-dependent plasticity of alpha and beta
activity during AO of dance and KMI. We also provide novel evidence for modulation of iAPF that is faster when tuned
to the specific motor repertoire of the observer. By considering the multiple functional roles of these frequency bands
during the same task (AO), we have disentangled the compounded contribution of familiarity and expertise to alpha
desynchronization for mediating task engagement among familiar ballet dancers and reflecting task difficulty among
unfamiliar non-dance subjects, respectively. That KMI of a complex dance sequence relative to everyday, non-dance
movements recruits greater cognitive resources suggests it may be a more powerful tool in driving neural plasticity of
action networks, especially among the elderly and those with movement disorders.

[1, 2] and non-human primates [3]. Each of these processes is vital in facilitating motor learning in general
and especially for dance movements, which require
transformation of multisensory inputs into highly specific and complex motor outputs that are reproduced
with high fidelity (for review, see [4, 5]). As a result of this

experience, activation of the mirror network and associated brain regions is modulated by dance experience [6,
7] to facilitate subsequent motor learning [8].
These and other evaluations of motor representations for complex movements that cannot physically
be performed during neuroimaging have utilized tasks
involving AO and/or KMI from an internal first-person
perspective. During four functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans conducted over a 34-week
period, recent investigations conducted by our lab have
employed both AO and KMI tasks for a novel piece of
choreography that was rehearsed and performed by professional ballet dancers. Consistent with findings from
Cross et al. [9], we found plasticity in the motor representation for this specific dance sequence coded in sensorimotor brain regions over time, as well as decreased
activation in the extrastriate body area during movement
of the foot in dancers relative to novice controls [10, 11].
While most of the evidence for experience-dependent
plasticity has come from fMRI studies, valuable insight
into the temporal dynamics of sensorimotor processing
has been revealed with electroencephalography (EEG).
With respect to action processing, the rolandic ‘mu’ alpha
rhythm (9–13 Hz) recorded directly from midline primary motor and somatosensory cortices has been shown
to decrease in power relative to rest, or desynchronize,
when planning, imagining and executing movements
[12], with concurrent desynchronization of the beta
(13–30 Hz) frequency band observed in motor cortex
[13]. Alpha desynchronization is also observed in other
brain areas under conditions of increased attentional and
cognitive effort, putatively reflecting suppression of taskirrelevant areas to enhance performance (for review, see
[14] and [15]). Within the alpha band there is typically a
maximal amplitude frequency known as the individual
alpha peak frequency (iAPF) that is typically lower (or
slower) in the elderly [16] and higher (or faster) during
states of cognitive preparedness [17] and under increased
cognitive demand [18].
Investigations on the influence of dance expertise on
EEG activity are sparse, as most expert studies assess
either proficiency in task performance, various types of
athletes (for review, see [19]) or the influence of aerobic exercise on EEG activity among non-experts [20].
However, a study by Ermutlu and colleagues [21] compared resting EEG activity across delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta
(4–8 Hz), alpha, and beta frequency bands in fast ball
sport athletes and dancers. They correctly predicted
that athletes, who have to quickly anticipate observed
movements and adapt their own motor responses,
would show higher power in slower bands, and dancers experienced at practicing rhythmic, imaginative

Page 2 of 14

and repetitive movements would show higher power in
the alpha and beta bands. With respect to task-related
activity during movement processing, Orgs et al. [22]
recorded EEG from expert dancers and non-experts
while they observed dance and non-dance movements.
They found no group differences during the latter condition, and alpha desynchronization among dancers only
when observing dance movements. It remains to be seen
whether similar experience-dependent modulation of the
alpha or beta bands occur during KMI of dance or nondance movements, and is one of the primary goals of the
present investigation.
Expanding upon the existing literature, the current
study sought to compare differences in alpha and beta
power during AO and KMI of a ballet dance sequence
among expert dancers that were both familiar and unfamiliar with the genre, as well as non-dancers, in order to
disentangle the effects of familiarity and expertise more
generally on action processing of dance movements. Similar to Orgs et al. [22], we also had participants perform
KMI for non-dance movements in order to examine possible transference of expertise effects.

Methods
Participants

Subjects were recruited through the York University
Undergraduate Research Participant Pool (URPP) and
compensated with course credit. The research study was
approved by the Office of Research Ethics’ Human Participants Review Committee (Certificate # 2013-211) and
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Eligibility requirements included self-reported right-handedness
and no uncorrected visual or neurological problems.
The advertised study called for participants with at
least 2–5 years of experience in any genre of dance or
related craft including gymnastics, figure skating, or
sports. A total of 92 participants were tested, but 31 were
excluded for the following reasons: lack of event markers
in EEG data (n = 9), demographic information not provided (n = 9), reported neurological problems (n = 1),
reported left-handedness (n = 4), poor EEG data quality
(n = 6), and no registered alpha peak values (n = 2). A
total of 61 participants (48 female) between the ages of 18
and 37 (M = 20.7, SD = 4.22) were analyzed. Participants
were divided into three groups based on their selfreported experience: ballet dancers (n = 25, 22 females,
mean age = 20.56, SD = 4.0, mean years of experience = 10.44, SD = 4.3), non-ballet dancers with experience in other genres of dance (n = 21, 15 females, mean
age = 20.67, SD = 3.6, mean years of experience = 5.57,
SD = 3.1), and non-dancers (n = 15, 11 females, mean
age = 21.07, SD = 5.5, mean years of experience = 5.8,

Di Nota et al. BMC Neurosci (2017) 18:28

SD = 4.6).1 Participants in both dance groups were
required to have at least 2 years of experience. Non-ballet
dance genres included belly dancing, hip hop, ballroom,
Salsa, tap, modern, lyrical, acro, cultural, folk, Bollywood,
jazz, break dancing, and contemporary. Non-dance subjects were not required to be experts in any particular
craft, but included subjects with at least 2 years of experience in skills such as figure skating (n = 5), gymnastics
(n = 4), martial arts (n = 1) and music (n = 1), as well as
non-experts (n = 4).
Procedure

After providing their informed consent to participate in
the study, participants were measured and fitted with the
EEG headset according to the International 10–20 System of electrode placement. Participants were instructed
to remain as still as possible during the experimental
tasks and were provided with ear bud headphones to
hear auditory stimuli. The computer-based experiment
began with a brief demographic survey and baseline
recordings followed by three tasks: (1) action observation (AO) and (2) kinaesthetic motor imagery (KMI) of
a ballet dance sequence, and (3) the KMI portion of the
Visual and Motor Imagery Questionnaire (VMIQ-2)
[23]. In order to minimize differences in dance imagery
across participants, the AO task was performed first and
allowed subjects to view the dance sequence as many
times as needed in order to form a clear mental image for
the subsequent KMI task.
Baseline

Four 15-s resting conditions were performed in random order to facilitate baseline correction of subsequent tasks: eyes open without music (BEO), eyes open
with music (BEOM), eyes closed without music (BEC),
and eyes closed with music (BECM). Participants were
instructed to clear their minds and to follow instructions
as they were given. A picture of a closed eye appeared on
screen during the eyes closed conditions to remind subjects to keep their eyes closed in the event they opened
them during the task (vertical visual angle = 13.6°), and
a central fixation cross (visual angle = 0.98°) appeared
during the eyes open conditions. Audio prompts cued
subjects to open and close their eyes at the beginning and
end of each baseline condition where appropriate. The
music conditions (BECM, BEOM) played the first 15 s of
Bach’s Goldberg Variations 988, Variation 1 to match the
cadence and genre of the music in the AO and KMI tasks.

Although the ballet group has significantly more years of experience
than non-ballet (pBonf = 0.000) and non-dance groups (pBonf = 0.002), no
dependent variables were significantly correlated with years of experience
except for the number of trials performed during the AO task (see “Results:
AO task” section).

AO task

Following the baseline recordings, participants repeatedly viewed an 8-s video clip of a choreographed ballet
dance. The clip was taken from a 6.92-min video that was
filmed during a practice at the Walter Carsen Centre for
The National Ballet of Canada from Bar and DeSouza’s
[10] study, and was played full screen on the computer
monitor (vertical visual angle = 13.6°). The video clip
featured one female dancer in the foreground and the
music was from Bach’s Concerto in C Major. Participants
were asked to closely observe the choreography performed by the female dancer in order to be able to imagine themselves performing it as accurately and precisely
as possible during the next experimental task. Because
participants were fit for EEG recording during the experimental session, motor performance was not behaviourally assessed in the laboratory. Instead, participants were
asked to rate how confident they were that they could
perform the dance with complete accuracy and precision if required to on the following scale modelled after
the VMIQ-2 scale [23]: 1 = Perfectly accurate and in time
with the music, 2 = Clear and reasonably accurate and in
time with the music, 3 = Moderately accurate and in time
with the music, 4 = Vaguely accurate and in time with
the music and dim, 5 = No accuracy at all and unable to
keep time with the music. The clip was initially shown 10
times (Block 1) with a 1-s interstimulus interval and fixation cross (visual angle = 0.98°) followed by a prompt for
a confidence rating. A participant response of 1 or 2 (i.e.,
indicating high confidence) would induce the end of the
AO task, and participants were asked if they would like
to view the clip a final five times (Block 2). A response
of 3–5 would automatically present an additional block
that played the dance clip five times (Block 2). Following
this shorter block, participants were once again asked to
rate their confidence that they could physically perform
the dance if required to. If participants respond below
threshold (i.e., 3–5), they could watch the shorter block
for a maximum of four times before automatically proceeding to the next experimental task. Participants could
view the clip a maximum of 30 times across 5 blocks.
The AO portion of the experiment lasted approximately
5–15 min.
KMI task

Following the AO task, participants were asked to visualize themselves performing the dance sequence they
had just learned with their eyes open and closed. Four
blocks (2× eyes open and 2× eyes closed) of 25 trials
each were randomly presented, resulting in a total of
100 KMI trials. During each trial, participants heard the
music that had accompanied the dance clip during the
AO task. Participants were asked to imagine themselves

Di Nota et al. BMC Neurosci (2017) 18:28

performing the dance in time with the music from an
internal, first-person perspective and to feel themselves
executing the movements as opposed to visualizing from
a third-person perspective (i.e., ‘seeing’ themselves perform the dance from an external perspective). The difference in visualization perspectives was explained during
initial briefing as well as in the written instructions presented on screen to ensure the proper engagement in
motor, and not visual, imagery [24]. The dance clip was
played once before each block to refresh the participant’s
memory and ensure that they were accurately imagining the dance. Similar to the baseline procedure, a picture of a closed eye appeared on screen during the eyes
closed condition and a central fixation cross was provided during the eyes open condition. Participants were
provided with audio prompts cuing them to open and
close their eyes when appropriate. As with the AO task,
participants were asked to rate how clearly and vividly
they were able to feel themselves performing the dance
sequence at the end of each block. Ratings were once
again given on a 5-point scale as follows: 1 = Perfectly
clear and as vivid (as normal vision or feel of movement),
2 = Clear and reasonably vivid, 3 = Moderately clear
and vivid, 4 = Vague and dim, 5 = No image at all, you
only “know” that you are thinking of the skill. Once an
answer was recorded, participants were given the opportunity to take a break before beginning the next block.
Each block lasted 3.5–4 min and the KMI task lasted
approximately 15–20 min.
For the purpose of the present study only eyes closed
KMI conditions will be included in the analysis so as
to compare them to the next task, which was only performed with eyes closed.
VMIQ‑2 task

In order to compare each participant’s EEG activity and
subjective perceptual level of vividness and clarity to KMI
for everyday, non-dance movements, the final experimental task required completing the third portion (KMI
from a first-person perspective) of the VMIQ-2 [23]. Participants were instructed to perform KMI of 12 everyday,
non-dance movements (Table 1) while eyes were closed
in accordance with VMIQ-2 instructions. For each item,
the requested action was written on the screen and the
participant was instructed to first close their eyes and
then press the spacebar when they were ready to begin
visualizing. Participants were instructed to spend as
much time as they needed to form a clear and accurate
image of feeling themselvescomplete each action, and to
press the spacebar once they had finished visualizing.
Upon this second button press, participants were asked
to rate how clear and vivid their KMI was for that item
using the same 5-point scale from previous tasks (i.e.,

Item
1. Walking
2. Running
3. Kicking a stone
4. Bending to pick up a coin
5. Running up stairs
6. Jumping sideways
7. Throwing a stone into water
8. Kicking a ball in the air
9. Running downhill
10. Riding a bike
11. Swinging on a rope
12. Jumping off a high wall
The complete VMIQ-2 [23] requires participants to imagine each of these
items in turn under three conditions: internal visual imagery, external visual
imagery, and kinesthetic (i.e., motor) imagery. The present study was only
interested in evaluating kinesthetic motor imagery, so participants were asked
to imagine themselves performing each of the items listed with their eyes
closed and as though they could “feel [them]self doing the movement” as per
the VMIQ-2 instructions [23]. Once they had formed a clear motor image of each
item, participants were asked to rate how clearly and vividly they could feel
themselves performing the movement on the following scale: 1 = Perfectly clear
and as vivid (as normal vision or feel of movement), 2 = Clear and reasonably vivid,
3 = Moderately clear and vivid, 4 = Vague and dim, 5 = No image at all, you only
“know” that you are thinking of the skill

1 = Perfectly clear and vivid, 5 = No image at all). As this
portion of the experiment was self-paced, completion
time varied from 1 to 3 min (average duration = 4.57 min,
SD = 4.25 min). Valid iAPF values were obtained from 59
subjects2 who were included in the final analyses.
Following completion of the VMIQ-2, participants
were asked if they felt that KMI was easier to complete
with eyes closed or eyes open and their responses were
recorded. Finally, the EEG headset was removed and participants were debriefed and thanked for their participation. The entire experiment from entrance to exit lasted
approximately 40–55 min.
Data acquisition, processing and analysis

EEG data were collected using a wireless 14-channel
(AF3, AF4, F3, F4, F7, F8, FC5, FC6, T7, T8, P7, P8, O1,
O2) Emotiv EPOC EEG Neuroheadset and recorded with
accompanying TestBench software (Emotiv Systems,
2012, San Fransisco, CA). The headset has two reference
locations (at M1 and M2), a sampling rate of 128 Hz with
16-bit ADC resolution, and 0.02–45 Hz resolution with

Two subjects from the non-dance group did not have iAPF values for the
VMIQ-2 task, but had iAPF values and were included in analyses for the
AO and KMI tasks.

digital 5th-order sinc notch filters at 50–60 Hz. The Emotiv neuroheadset has been validated [25] and provides
several ecological advantages to traditional researchgrade EEG systems. These include affordability and portability to record EEG in environments outside of the
laboratory, including a dance studio where neural activity
can be evaluated on-site [26]. All experimental tasks were
presented on a 23ʺ flat screen monitor (Dell P2312H)
and configured and presented by MediaLab (v2012.4.119,
Blair Jarvis for Empirisoft Co., New York, NY). Data
markers were sent from MediaLab to TestBench via a
Virtual Serial Port Driver (Version 7.1, Eltima Software,
2013, Bellevue, WA). Preprocessing of the EEG data was
conducted with the Fieldtrip toolbox (Version 20131117,
[27]) and Matlab (Version 7.10.0.499, The MathWorks,
Inc., Natick, MA), and statistical analyses were performed with SPSS (Version 22, IBM Co., Armonk, NY).
For each participant, raw EEG data was first segmented
according to data markers coded for events of interest (i.e., experimental tasks), and these segments were
further divided into 2-s epochs prior to being bandpass
filtered (1–50 Hz), demeaned, and detrended. Next,
artifacts were rejected by visual inspection (M = 51 trials, SD = 18.5 out of an average 483.3 trials, SD = 28.5)
and independent component analyses were performed
to eliminate contamination of the EEG signal from eye
movements and blinks (M = 2.15, SD = 0.60 components
eliminated out of 14 total components). Data were fast
Fourier transformed and iAPF (Hz), alpha peak power
(μV2), and average beta power across the 13–30 Hz range
were computed for each participant, experimental task
and electrode.
To normalize the variances of power data among
electrodes, alpha and beta power values were log transformed and baseline corrected with the appropriate
baseline condition (i.e., AO task baseline corrected with
BEOM; KMI and VMIQ-2 tasks baseline corrected with
BECM) prior to statistical analyses. The following equations were used to compute log task-related alpha peak
power (herein referred to as “alpha”) and log task-related
beta power (herein referred to as “beta”) modeled from
Gonzalez-Rosa et al. [28]:

alpha power = log alpha peak power (task)
− log alpha peak power (baseline)
beta power = log beta power (task)
− log beta power (baseline)
Alpha power was not subdivided into the rolandic mu
(9–13 Hz) frequency, as it is typically recorded from central (C3, C4, Cz, Fz) electrode sites that are not included
in the Emotiv neuroheadset used in the current study.
Instead, we isolated the iAPF within the traditional

Page 5 of 14

8–12 Hz bandwidth and focused statistical analyses on
electrode sites overlying available and relevant sensorimotor areas including bilateral frontocentral (FC5, FC6)
motor association cortex [29], superior temporal cortex
(T7, T8) involved in perceptual learning [30] and sensory-guided KMI [31], inferior posterior temporal gyrus
(P7, P8), and primary visual occipital cortex (O1, O2)
[32].
All statistical analyses including the factor of Electrode
[FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, T8, P8, FC6] employed a repeated
measures analyses of variance (RM-ANOVA) design. For
analyses of the AO task evaluating the factor of Time
[Blocks 1–5], a mixed model structure was applied to
the RM-ANOVA to account for the different number of
blocks performed between subjects, which would not
be adequately corrected for in a RM-ANOVA. Sphericity was assessed for each within-subject factor with
Mauchly’s Test and violations were adjusted by reporting
degrees of freedom and significance values with HuynhFeldt corrections (pHF) [33]. Least-significant difference
(LSD) significance values are reported (p) for main and
interaction effects where sphericity is assumed, for pairwise comparisons of 2-level factors, and for one-way
between-group ANOVAs. Pairwise comparisons of main
effects with more than 2 levels (i.e., Group, Electrode or
Time) and simple effects of significant interactions report
Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons (pBonf).
Effect sizes (partial eta squared, η2) are reported where
appropriate. Exploratory Pearson correlations were performed on data (collapsed across all factors) as secondary
analyses reported in-text with LSD p values. The results
of each task will be presented in turn in the following
order: analyses of demographic data and confidence ratings, iAPF, alpha power and beta power.

Results
Baseline analyses

To evaluate possible between-group differences in baseline iAPF, log alpha peak power, and/or log beta power,
three separate RM-ANOVA’s were performed with the
factors of Condition (4) × Electrode (8) × Group (3).
For iAPF, a main effect of Condition [F(3, 174) = 3.616,
p = 0.014, η2 = 0.06] revealed faster iAPF during
BEOM relative to BECM only (pBonf = 0.024) (Fig. 1).
A main effect of Electrode just met significance criteria
[F(7, 406) = 2.033, p = 0.050, η2 = 0.03] with no significant Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons.
As expected, alpha power was higher during both eyes
closed conditions (BEC, BECM) relative to eyes open
(BEO, BEOM) in all electrodes [Condition × Electrode: F(12.1, 700.9) = 49.085, pHF = 0.000, η2 = 0.46],
as was beta power in parietal (P7: pBonf = 0.002, P8:
pBonf = 0.000) and occipital (O1 and O2: pBonf = 0.000)

Fig. 1 Individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF) during action observation and motor imagery. The highly familiar ballet dance group showed faster
iAPF during the AO task relative to both non-ballet dance (p = 0.029) and non-dance (p = 0.018) groups, and also demonstrated faster iAPF than
non-ballet (p = 0.049) and non-dance groups (p = 0.027) during the VMIQ-2 task. No significance between group effects were observed during the
KMI task, and all participants had significantly faster iAPF during the VMIQ-2 task relative to the KMI task (p = 0.000). Error bars represent SEM

electrodes [Condition × Electrode: F (13.0,
25.0) = 31.608, pHF = 0.000, η2 = 0.35]. No significant
between-group differences were observed for iAPF, alpha
or beta power (p > 0.05).
Task-related changes to alpha and beta power reported
below subtract baseline in their calculations, so we will
report task-related changes to iAPF relative to baseline
here. To evaluate matched conditions with eyes open
and music, we compared BEOM and AO iAPF with
a 2 (Task) × 8 (Electrode) × 3 (Group) RM-ANOVA,
which revealed slower iAPF during AO in non-ballet
dancers only [pBonf = 0.016, F(2, 58) = 3.093, p = 0.053,
η2 = 0.03]. To evaluate task-related changes to iAPF during eyes closed tasks and conditions, we compared BEC,
BECM, KMI and VMIQ-2 iAPF values with a 4 (Task) × 8
(Electrode) × 3 (Group) RM-ANOVA and found faster
iAPF during VMIQ-2 relative to BEC (pBonf = 0.027),
BECM (pBonf = 0.003), and KMI (pBonf = 0.000) [Task:
F(3, 168) = 8.912, p = 0.000, η2 = 0.14]. No other main
or interaction effects were significant (Fig. 1). Betweengroup evaluations of iAPF for each task will be reported
in the following sections.
AO task

Empirical behavioural measures of perceived confidence
in performing the dance sequence included the number of

blocks performed by each subject before moving on to the
KMI task, and the average of subjective ratings provided
after each block of the AO task. The non-dance group performed significantly more trials (M = 24.7, SD = 5.8) than
both familiar ballet (M = 18.8, SD = 4.9, pBonf = 0.008) and
unfamiliar non-ballet dancer groups (M = 20.0, SD = 6.5,
pBonf = 0.056) [F(2, 58) = 5.170, p = 0.009], and were
also less confident in their ability to actually perform the
dance if required (i.e., higher confidence rating, M = 3.0,
SD = 0.09) compared to ballet (M = 2.4, SD = 0.05,
p = 0.004) and non-ballet dance groups (M = 2.6,
SD = 0.06, p = 0.004) [F(2, 58) = 4.574, p = 0.014] (Fig. 2).
The number of trials performed was significantly correlated to years of dance experience (r = −0.252, p = 0.050)
(Fig. 3a), subjective ratings (r = 0.867, p = 0.000) (Fig. 3b),
and alpha power (r = −0.308, p = 0.016) (Fig. 3c). Confidence ratings during the AO task were also significantly correlated to those obtained during the KMI task
[r = 0.286, p = 0.025] (Fig. 3d).
Ballet dancers exhibited faster iAPF (M = 10.8,
SD = 0.7) than both non-ballet dancers (M = 10.5,
SD = 0.7, pBonf = 0.023) and non-dancers (M = 10.7,
SD = 0.8, pBonf = 0.048) [Group: F(2, 25.3) = 5.467,
pHF = 0.011] (Fig. 1), and was higher among ballet dancers than non-ballet dancers during Block 2 (pBonf = 0.004)
[Group × Time: F(8, 18.1) = 3.098, pHF = 0.022]. A

Fig. 2 Subjective ratings of action observation and motor imagery. Participants were asked to provide a confidence rating for how accurately they
could perform the dance if they were required to for the AO task, and to rate how clearly and vividly they imagined the instructed behaviour for the
KMI and VMIQ-2 tasks on a scale from 1 (Perfectly accurate or clear) to 5 (Not at all, or no image at all). Non-dancers provided significantly higher rat‑
ings (i.e., poorer perceived ability) during the AO task relative to ballet dancers (p = 0.004) and non-ballet dancers (p = 0.044). All groups provided
significantly lower ratings, indicative of clearer imagery, when imagining non-expressive movements during the VMIQ-2 task relative to KMI of the
newly-learned dance (ballet: p = 0.005, non-ballet and non-dance: p = 0.000). Error bars represent SEM

significant main effect of Time [F(4, 18.8) = 3.655,
pHF = 0.023] also showed faster iAPF during Block 1
relative to Block 4 (pBonf = 0.006), and AO iAPF was
significantly correlated to iAPF during KMI [r = 0.585,
p = 0.000] and VMIQ-2 [r = 0.567, p = 0.000] (Fig. 3e).
Alpha power was greater among non-ballet dancers relative to non-dancers (pBonf = 0.000) [Group:
F(2, 78.8) = 7.704, pHF = 0.001], but a significant Group × Time interaction [F(8, 37.2) = 2.659,
pHF = 0.021] revealed greater alpha power among nonballet dancers relative to both groups during Block 1 (ballet dancers: pBonf = 0.041, non-dancers: pBonf = 0.040) and
relative to ballet dancers during Block 2 (pBonf = 0.010),
but greater alpha power among ballet dancers than nondancers during Block 5 (pBonf = 0.039) (Fig. 4a). Alpha
and beta power were also significantly correlated during
AO (r = 0.504, p = 0.000). Beta power was significantly
greater among ballet dancers relative to both non-ballet
dancers (pBonf = 0.003) and non-dancers (pBonf = 0.000)
[Group: F(2, 19.0) = 19.810, pHF = 0.000], demonstrating modulation of beta power by familiarity with the
observed stimulus (Fig. 4b). Further, a significant main
effect of Electrode [F(7, 9.3) = 4.790, pHF = 0.016]
showed higher beta power in bilateral occipital electrodes relative to left premotor cortex (O1: pBonf = 0.012,
O2: pBonf = 0.024).

KMI task

Analyses of the average motor imagery ratings provided at the end of each block of the KMI task revealed
no differences in clarity or vividness between groups
[F(2, 58) = 1.137, p = 0.328] (Fig. 2), and were significantly correlated to those obtained during the VMIQ-2
task (r = 0.370, p = 0.003). There were no significant
group differences in task-related iAPF (Fig. 1) or alpha
power (p > 0.05), but comparing log alpha power during KMI to baseline revealed significant desynchronization (baseline > KMI) during motor imagery [Task: F(1,
58) = 6.236, p = 0.015, η2 = 0.098], as well as higher
alpha power in O1, O2, P7 and P8 electrodes relative to the temporal and frontal sites [Electrode: F(4.7,
272.7) = 207.713, pHF = 0.000, η2 = 0.782] (Fig. 5a). Taskrelated beta power was higher in left (pBonf = 0.001) and
right (pBonf = 0.013) premotor cortex relative to left superior temporal cortex [Electrode: F(4.9, 282.1) = 4.686,
pHF = .000, η2 = 0.075]. Similar to alpha power, when
comparing log beta power during KMI and baseline
we found significant desynchronization during motor
imagery [Task: F(1, 58) = 7.951, p = 0.007, η2 = 0.121]
especially in T7 (pBonf = 0.000), P7 (pBonf = 0.008), O1
(pBonf = 0.026), P8 (pBonf = 0.006), and T8 (pBonf = 0.018)
[Task × Electrode: F(4.9, 282.1) = 4.686, pHF = 0.000,
η2 = 0.075] (Fig. 5b). Beta power was also found to

We confirmed that there were no inherent differences in
motor imagery ability between groups with a one-way

12 movements) [F(2, 58) = 2.245, p = 0.115] (Fig. 2).
Separate 8 (Electrode) × 3 (Group) RM-ANOVAs on

Fig. 4 Alpha and beta power during observation of a novel ballet dance sequence. a Log task-related (i.e., baseline corrected) alpha power was
significantly higher in the non-ballet group relative to non-dancers (pBonf = 0.000) in all blocks, while a significant Group × Time interaction revealed
higher alpha power in non-ballet dancers than the other groups at Block 1 (ballet: pBonf = 0.041, non-dance: pBonf = 0.040) and higher than ballet
dancers at Block 2 (pBonf = 0.010), and greater alpha power in ballet dancers than non-dancers at Block 5 (pBonf = 0.039). b Log task-related beta

faster in occipital cortex relative to all other sites [F(6.3,
350.3) = 5.843, pHF = 0.000, η2 = 0.094]. Alpha power
did not differ between electrodes or groups (p > 0.1), and
similar to the KMI task beta power was higher in bilateral
premotor cortex relative to superior temporal (FC5 > T7:
p = 0.002, T8: p = 0.004; FC6 > T7: p = 0.013, T8:
p = 0.003), left occipital (FC5 > O1: p = 0.014; FC6 > O1:
p = 0.047) and right parietal cortex (FC5 > P8: p = 0.005)
but only at uncorrected significance levels [Electrode:
F(5.1, 286.4) = 3.489, pHF = 0.004, η2 = 0.059].
To compare the perceptual quality of KMI for habitual
movements to KMI of a complex ballet sequence, we also

performed a 2 (Task) x 3 (Group) RM-ANOVA on confidence ratings. It was confirmed that all participants
reported significantly clearer and more vivid imagery
during the VMIQ-2 task relative to the KMI task3 [F(1,
58) = 61.821, p = 0.000, η2 = 0.516, Task × Group:

pBonf = 0.0005, non-ballet dancers and non-dancers:
pBonf = 0.000] (Fig. 2). Neural features of KMI (alpha
power and beta power) were also compared between
the KMI and VMIQ-2 tasks with separate 2 (Task) × 8
(Electrode) × 3 (Group) RM-ANOVAs, respectively.
Significantly faster iAPF [F(1, 56) = 31.960, p = 0.000,

among all participants during the VMIQ-2 task relative
to the KMI task. A significant main effect of electrode
[F(4.8, 266.9) = 2.984, pHF = 0.005, η2 = 0.051] revealed
faster iAPF in occipital cortex relative to left premotor
cortex (O1: pBonf = 0.004, O2: pBonf = 0.006), and beta
power was higher in premotor cortices than temporal
(FC5 > T7: pBonf = 0.001, T8: pBonf = 0.025; FC6 > T7:
pBonf = 0.028, T8: pBonf = 0.014) and right parietal cortex
(FC5 > P8: pBonf = 0.006) [Electrode: F(4.5, 249.9 = 5.537,

Discussion
Based on behavioral and neural indices, we demonstrate modulation of oscillatory brain activity by familiarity with an observed ballet stimulus superseding any

general dance expertise effects, but no such differences
were observed when subjects performed motor imagery
of a ballet dance. However, ballet dancers demonstrated
faster iAPF during KMI of non-dance movements.
Among all participants, KMI was reportedly clearer and
more vivid when imagining non-dance movements relative to a complex dance sequence and also elicited faster
iAPF and less desychnronization in both alpha and beta
frequency bands. These results expand current understanding of experience-dependent plasticity of alpha and
beta activity underlying movement processing in dancers.
While our conclusions are not based on oscillatory activity in primary motor and/or supplementary motor areas,
they provide novel insights on a network of sensorimotor
association areas that are modified by learning [28] and
expertise [34], and are involved in a variety of functions
related to action processing.

Fig. 6 Task-related alpha power during KMI of a newly-learned ballet
dance and non-dance movements. Log task-related (i.e., baselinecorrected) alpha power was significantly higher during the VMIQ-2
task than during KMI (pBonf = 0. 0 01). Participants performed motor
imagery with their eyes closed in both tasks, but showed higher
alpha power when imagining non-expressive quotidian movements
relative to a newly-learned complex ballet dance sequence. Error bars
represent SEM

Several behavioral indices obtained during the AO task
reveal greater task engagement by familiar ballet dancers relative to the unfamiliar non-ballet dancers, who
also putatively possess specialized sensorimotor networks arising from dance-related experience but in different genres, and relative to non-dancers, who served as
a control group for dance-related expertise and familiarity. Ballet dancers performed significantly fewer blocks
of the self-paced task, provided lower subjective ratings
reflecting greater confidence in their ability to perform
the dance sequence if required (Fig. 2), and a strong positive correlation between these two variables (Fig. 3b).
The number of trials performed was also negatively
correlated to alpha power (Fig. 3c), demonstrating that
subjects who were less confident in their perceived ability to perform the observed task exhibited greater alpha
desynchronization than participants who performed
fewer trials. Although the clarity ratings provided during
the KMI task did not differ between groups, they were
positively correlated to AO confidence ratings (Fig. 3d).
Examination of the oscillatory activity underlying the
experimental tasks will provide greater insight into the
mechanisms underlying these behavioural differences in
task engagement.
State iAPF

Higher iAPF is reflected during states of arousal, attention and readiness to perform cognitive tasks including
working memory ([17], for review see [14, 35]). However,

Page 11 of 14

these evaluations often compare performance outcomes
to pre-task iAPF levels obtained at rest. Samaha and Postle [36] compared performance on a two-flash fusion
task to pre-task iAPF as well pre-stimulus iAPF, and
found that both were correlated to lower thresholds and
improved performance on this task, which serves as a
measure of temporal resolution of visual perception. In
order to form a clear motor image of the dance for the
KMI task in the current study, ballet dancers’ visual and
sensorimotor systems were able to process more information during AO on a finer temporal scale. Since their
iAPF did not differ from other groups in pre-task baseline
conditions (Fig. 1), we can infer that this ‘state’ change is
driven by a combination of bottom-up perceptual features of the familiar dance genre and top-down influences from existing (embodied) knowledge of the motor
repertoire from neural networks shaped by experience
[37]. Evidence for the latter is supported by the recent
identification of alpha and beta as feedback signals from
higher-order regions, including those where the motor
representations of ballet movements and positions are
coded, to primary sensory areas including the visual cortex [38]. Additionally, it has been noted in dance-related
neuroaesthetic literature that dancers, and ballet dancers
in particular, use KMI as a tool for mental rehearsal in the
absence of overt movement [4, 39]. Although this was not
directly assessed in our participants, and no differences
in imagery ability were found when comparing VMIQ-2
ratings (Fig. 2), we suggest long-term experience with
dance KMI may reinforce the neural pathways that optimally integrate real auditory (i.e., music) information
with imagined motor signals [10, 31]. This dance-induced
neuroplasticity of oscillatory brain activity may account
for the observed increase in iAPF among ballet dancers
during VMIQ-2 and AO relative to other groups (Fig. 1).
Taken together, results from the AO and VMIQ-2 tasks
support and extend previous findings by showing that
iAPF can be modulated by experience in dance, and specifically in ballet.
Engagement versus difficulty: iAPF and alpha power

Haegens et al. [18] provide evidence for modulation of
iAPF during task performance, with increased cognitive
demand resulting in faster occipital and parietal iAPF.
Accordingly, one would expect higher iAPF while visualizing a more demanding action (dance) relative to nondance movements (VMIQ-2). However, the opposite
pattern was observed suggesting all subjects were more
engaged during KMI of the less demanding VMIQ-2 task
(Fig. 1). Conflicting evidence for changes in alpha power
that accompany higher iAPF have been shown depending
on the nature of the cognitive task; desynchronization has
been shown to reflect the active engagement in encoding

Di Nota et al. BMC Neurosci (2017) 18:28

and memory retention [40] while alpha synchronization
(increased alpha power) suggests a decrease in expended
cortical resources following skill learning [41] and is
related to suppression of distracting information that can
interfere with encoding from parieto-occipital sources
[42, 43] that comprise most of the source signals in the
current investigation. As such, the desynchronization
elicited during dance KMI may reflect processing of the
dance that had just been observed and encoded in working (visual) memory while the relatively greater alpha
power elicited during the VMIQ-2 task could reflect the
reduced cognitive load for imagining simple movements
(Table 1) in the face of competing stimuli or attentional
demands (Fig. 6). This pattern is consistent with the neural efficiency hypothesis [44], which supposes that alpha
synchronization reflects inhibition of task-irrelevant
areas, including posterior visual areas when performing
first-person KMI [24, 45], and alpha desynchronization
is highest during focused task-related activation such as
what would be expected during KMI of a newly-learned
task. Thus, engaging with familiar stimuli recruits oscillatory mechanisms that are distinct from those that are
phenomenologically similar to processes engaged during
very difficult tasks.
Neural efficiency: alpha and beta power

Further evidence for the neural efficiency hypothesis can
be observed during the AO task, which replicates previous evidence for experience-dependent alpha desynchronization during AO [22] but with evidence for
desynchronization among non-dancers as well (Fig. 4a).
To confirm that this similar pattern of alpha power
among groups on opposite ends of the familiarity continuum does not reflect the same underlying process,
we can consider the observed beta power results during
AO. Beta desynchronization has been shown to accompany alpha desynchronization during AO (lower beta
(13–18 Hz) only in [22]) and KMI [46], and is further
decreased during KMI and execution of skilled movements [47, 48]. In addition, both frequency and power
of the beta band have been related to cognitive aspects
of movement, including cue anticipation or expectation, visuomotor integration and preparation [49]. Beta
synchronization is typically observed during the ‘postmovement rebound’ in a wider distributed premotor
and sensorimotor area [50–52] and occurs immediately
following real or imagined movement as a ‘resetting’ of
motor representations in these networks [53–55]. If beta
oscillations originate in the primary motor cortex as previously suggested [48, 50], and responsivity of the sensorimotor cortex is greater for familiar embodied actions
[6–9, 56], then perhaps the degree of beta desynchronization can also be nuanced by experience-dependent

Page 12 of 14

plasticity. Because our current sample of ballet dancers
exhibit significantly greater familiarity and expertise (i.e.,
more years of experience) in dance, the influence of these
factors taken together may compound the observed beta
desynchronization during AO relative to both unfamiliar
groups (Fig. 4b). From a neurophysiological perspective,
these findings could possibly reflect less suppression of
the distributed sensorimotor network that encodes existing genre-specific motor representations, which would
only provide competition for limited neural resources
among less experienced and unfamiliar dancers. Thus, by
considering activity in multiple frequency bands during
the same task, the present results clarify the impact of
familiarity and expertise more generally on multiple concurrent functional roles for alpha and beta power during
AO and KMI.
Therapeutic applications for dance‑induced modulation
of sensorimotor oscillations

A growing body of evidence is lending credit to the therapeutic benefits of dance practice on general health, and
especially for the elderly and those afflicted with movement disorders (for review, see [57]). It is well established that iAPF is lower in the elderly [16] and especially
among those with neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s [58] and Parkinson’s disease (PD) [59, 60]. Ongoing investigations by our lab and other research teams are
demonstrating efficacy of Dance with Parkinson’s programs on the neural, motor and non-motor symptoms
of PD, including increased global alpha power following
a single dance class [26, 61, 62]. The presently demonstrated state/task-related increases in iAPF during KMI
of everyday movements provides encouraging evidence
for low-impact KMI training programmes that can yield
improvements in iAPF functioning that can translate to
resting state iAPF improvements. Previous work from
our lab reveals dance-induced plasticity in the extrastriate body area during movement among expert dancers
[11], which has been shown to serve as an alternate motor
pathway for people with PD [63, 64]. Further research on
how dance-induced neuroplasticity manifests in healthy
experts will provide greater insights to effective interventions for this and other clinical populations.

Conclusions
Several important insights are revealed in light of the
observed outcomes, including a further understanding of experience-dependent plasticity of the neural
mechanisms underlying action observation and KMI
of specialized and habitual movements. Specifically,
we demonstrate modulation of alpha peak frequency
and power in the alpha and beta frequency bands during observation of a familiar dance sequence relative to

Di Nota et al. BMC Neurosci (2017) 18:28

unfamiliar participants, with further expertise effects
resulting in more efficient visuomotor processing during KMI of non-dance movements. While all participants
demonstrated alpha and beta desynchronization during
KMI, we clarify that familiarity with the imagined stimulus does not result in significant modulation of these signals, unlike action observation. Together, these findings
promote the translational benefits of dance practice to
attentional and sensorimotor networks, and lend further
support for the efficacy of dance and motor imagery as
effective BCI source signals and therapeutic interventions for clinical populations with movement disorders.
