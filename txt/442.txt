Abstract
Measuring brain activity outside the laboratory is of great importance for investigating
human behavior under naturalistic conditions (e.g., in cognition and movement research,
application of brain-computer interfaces). To measure neuronal activity in moving subjects,
only modified NIRS and EEG systems are applicable. Because conventional EEG systems are
too sensitive to movement artifacts, artifact sources should be eliminated beforehand to
improve signal quality. Four different approaches for EEG/ERP measures with moving
subjects were tested in case studies: (i) a purpose-built head-mounted preamplifier, (ii) a
laboratory system with active electrodes, (iii)+(iv) a wireless headset combined with (iii)
passive or (iv) active electrodes. A standard visual oddball task was applied during rest (without
movement) and during ergometer rowing. All 14 measures revealed very similiar (within
subjects) visual evoked potentials for rowing and rest. The small intraindividual differences
between rowing and rest, in comparison to the typically larger interindividual differences in
the ERP waveforms revealed that ERPs can be measured reliably even in an athletic movement
like rowing. The expected modulation of the motor-related activity by force output, on the other
hand, was largely affected by movement artifacts. Therefore, for a successful application of
ERP measures in movement research, further developments to differentiate between
movement-related neuronal activity and movement-related artifacts are required. However, it
cannot be excluded that activities with small magnitudes related to motor learning and motor
control cannot be detected because they are superimposed by the very large motor potential
which increases with force output.

1. Introduction
The investigation of brain functions with noninvasive methods like functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG),
near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is typically
limited to laboratory settings. This is because the systems are very large and cannot be moved
and head movements must be avoided (fMRI, MEG) or head and body movements generate
large movement artifacts. Within the last decade there has been a rapidly increasing interest in
investigating brain functions in ecological settings (e.g., cognitive or neuropsychological
processes in interaction with a natural environment or in a social context; and movement
analysis and motor learning) which require portable systems (e.g., Ruffini et al., 2007; Chi et
al., 2012; Gramann et al., 2011, 2014; Kranczioch et al., 2014; Stopczynski et al., 2014).
Especially in the field of movement research/motor learning laboratory settings are strongly
limiting because only simple finger or hand or arm movements can be investigated and it is
questioned whether the results of these studies can be transferred to complex movements (e.g.
Dum and Strick, 2002; Hazeltine and Ivry, 2002; Wulf and Shea, 2002). In principle, NIRS
and EEG are suited for measures in moving subjects because the sensors are small and fixed to
the head (rather than the head being fixed to the sensor) and the necessary electronics and
recording devices can be built small enough. NIRS, like fMRI, measures the hemodynamic
response related to specific brain processes with a low temporal resolution. Spatially it is
restricted to cortical layers close to the skull. Atsumori et al. (2010) used a modified NIRS
system successfully in a cognitive task when subjects were walking around. Piper et al. (2014)
developed a miniaturised wearable functional NIRS system and tested it when subjects
performed a left hand gripping task (i) sitting still on a bicycle, (ii) pedalling indoor on a
stationary training bicycle, and (iii) during outdoor bicycle riding. The event-related data
showed that the task was performed successfully and comparably in all three conditions,
whereas data loss was highest in real cycling (about 35%), but much lower in indoor cycling
(7.5%) and under rest (5%).
Event-related potential (ERP) measures, which are the focus of this paper, have the
well-known limited spatial resolution but a high temporal resolution which is essential to
analyze complex movements: for example the time course of feedback and feedforward
processing in visuomotor learning (e.g. Hill, 2009, 2014). Conventional EEG systems are very
sensitive to mechanical (cable and electrode movements) and physiological (electromyogram
(EMG) of head and neck muscles, and sweating) movement artifacts (Zschocke, 2002). If
cognitive processes in a moving subject rather than the movement itself are the focus of
interest, data preprocessing algorithms informed by the behavioral movement data can be used
to clean the EEG data from movement-related (neuronal and artifactual) activity (Gwin et al.,
2010; Stone et al., 2018). If the motor-related activity is of interest, advanced data
preprocessing algorithms such as independent component analysis (ICA; Makeig et al., 1996)
can be used to correct such artifacts. However, a study measuring ERPs during walking and
running on a treadmill showed that data loss was very high (on average 130 of 248 EEG channel
signals remained), even using a system with active electrodes which are considerably less prone
to artifacts than conventional passive electrodes (Gramann et al., 2010; Gwin et al., 2011).
Furthermore, the usability of conventional EEG systems like the one used in these studies is
limited for measures with moving subjects. In movement tasks with only marginal head
movements, like cycling on an ergometer, these laboratory systems combined with ICA-based
artifact correction can be applied succesful for EEG measures (Enders and Nigg, 2016). E.g.
Enders et al. (2016) found in a high-intensive cycling exercise an increase in spectral power
when the athletes were fatigued. If spectral changes of higher EEG frequencies (alpha to

gamma) are in the focus of interest, like in the Enders et al. study, artifacts directly coupled to
movement execution are outside of this frequency range because movement frequencies are
considerably lower. However harmonics of these movement frequencies may occur which have
to be considered. With fully moving subjects, in contrast, artifacts are more difficult to handle.
In a cocktail party study (including eating, drinking, chatting, etc.) with ten subjects wearing
self-made (noncommercial) wireless EEG headsets, about 40% of the data was lost due to
artifacts in contrast to 4% in two laboratory studies (Gevins et al., 2012). Despite this high data
loss, these studies revealed valuable ERP (Gramann et al., 2010; Gwin et al., 2011) or spectral
EEG (Gevins et al., 2012) results. However, especially in movement research the method of
choice is to avoid the generation of mechanical artifacts beforehand by technical modifications.
This approach was used in the four pilot studies reported in this paper that tested the suitability
of different technical solutions to measure ERPs during ergometer rowing (Fig. 1). Especially
for analysing motor-related brain activity with ERPs, rowing is well suited. It is a cyclic
movement with a high number of repetitions and the degrees of freedom of the movement are
limited by the biomechanical constraints of the equipment (boat and scull/oar, or ergometer).
Furthermore, in contrast to e.g. cycling or cayaking, the rowing movement is composed of
different (more or less) distinct movement elements and movement frequency is lower (20-40
strokes/minute vs. 60-120 revolutions/minute in cycling). Finally, the biomechanical data
(dynamics and kinematics of the movement, and boat and scull/oar movement), which are
partly necessary for ERP analysis, can be measured meanwhile with relative ease.
The most critical question before pilot Study 1 (see below) was, if movement artifacts
distort the EEG data completely or if there are systematic artifacts which can be controlled and
either (partly) excluded or corrected in offline analysis. To test this question, a reliability check
was made. A standard visual oddball task was applied in a rest condition (without movement)
and during ergometer rowing. Similar – not movement related – ERP activities during rest and
during rowing would show that ERPs can be measured reliably in a moving subject. The second
methodological question – concerning the analysis of motor behavior with ERPs – is: can
movement-related artifacts be identified and separated from motor-related neuronal activity?
As an indicator for a reliable measure of motor-related activity, at least a motor potential (MP),
a negative activity related to force output, should be expected. Siemionow et al. (2000) showed
in a study which used isometric elbow flexions that the amplitude of the MP (labelled motorrelated cortical potential (MRCP) in this study) correlates very highly with EMG activity (r >
0.8) and the generated muscle force (r = 0.95). Furthermore, Dai et al. (2001) found in a fMRI
study a high correlation between isometric force (using a hand-grip dynamometer) and activity
in the primary motor cortex. The MP/MRCP must be generated by different generators because
it can already be evoked when a muscle activation is only imagined. This should originate in
the supplementary motor area (SMA; Ranganathan et al., 2004). A second part of the MP is
thought to be related to the control of muscle activation by the primary motor cortex.
Objectives: The purpose of these four pilot studies was (i) to test if ERPs can in principle be
measured during an athletic movement pattern like rowing, (ii) to explore the limitations due
to movement artifacts, and (iii) to test if movement artifacts can be reduced. Methodologically,
the impact of physical and physiological artifact sources was investigated by comparing ERP
waveforms measured in rest and during movement. For the existing data material this physical
approach is the method of choice compared to a statistical analysis of parametrized abstract
data derived from the original data. Study outlines: In pilot Study 1 (conducted in 2005) a
small, purpose-built 20-channel system was used with a preamplifier connected to the head and
electrodes with shortened and fixed cables mounted to a standard electrode cap. Because this
approach was only partly successful the second approach (Study 2) was performed. This
experiment involved the use of a to that time (2008) in our lab available system with active

electrodes with built-in preamplifiers, and the amplifier was worn in a backpack. In pilot Study
3 (2013), as the newest improvement in EEG technology, a small head-mounted EEG system
with wireless data transmission was combined with the electrodes and cap used in Study 1. In
Study 4 (2018), finally, the headset used in Study 3 was combined with active electrodes and
rowing force and movement speed was systematically varied to investigate the influence of
these factors on data quality.

Fig. 1. EEG recording during ergometer rowing in pilot Study 3. The Concept II (Model C)
indoor rower was used for all three pilot studies. The Concept II models are the most frequently
used ergometers for training in competitive rowing and performance diagnostics. In the drive
phase of the rowing cycle, the rower’s pull accelerates an air resistance braked flywheel in the
round cage. In the recovery phase the rower moves in opposite direction on the sliding seat,
preparing for the next pull. A monitor displays stroke rate, time, and distance rowed, power per
stroke, mean power, calories burned. On the chair at the right side in front of the rower is the
laptop for stimulus presentation. The laptop on the table recorded the behavioral and EEG data
(photo use with participant’s permission).
2. Pilot Study 1
2.1. Materials and Methods
A preliminary test using a standard EEG system (NeuroScan SynAmps) by wearing
the 32-channel preamplifier headbox in a backpack revealed no satisfying results. Therefore,
to reduce the generation of artifacts due to cable and electrode movements, a small purposebuilt (according to Simon, 1977) battery-powered 20-channel system (based on positive
previous experiences with a similar three-channel system) was used with an occipitally
mounted preamplifier (differential amplifier, gain = 30; hardware filters: 0.27 Hz passive RC
highpass; 30 Hz 2nd-order Bessel lowpass). After a second amplifier stage (total gain = 3600)

the signals were digitised using a BEST system (Dr. Grossegger & Drbal, Korneuburg, Austria;
sample rate 256 Hz, resolution 0.3 μV/bit). An electrode cap (EasyCap, www.easycap.de) and
22 gold electrodes (Grass) with shortened cables were used. Electrode caps with electrodes
fixed to the cap have the disadvantage that the contact of some electrodes with the skin can be
poor, depending on head shape (that is, if there are dents in the skull the distance between cap
and skin can be too large). Therefore the standard adaptors inserted in the cap were removed,
the adaptor holes were enlarged, and the electrodes were fixed using a highly viscous
conductive paste (Nihon-Kohden Elefix). EEG was recorded from 20 sites (midline: FPz, Fz,
FCz, CPz, Pz, and Iz; Left/right: FC1/2, FC3/4, FC5/6, C3/4, CP1/2, CP3/4, left and right
mastoid) covering mainly the sensorimotor area, and Iz to assess visual evoked potentials
(VEPs). Data were recorded using Cz as reference and rereferenced offline (see results for
details). A visual oddball task was used with 180 black-white fullscreen checkerboards
(frequent), 60 red-white checkerboards (deviant), and 60 gray crosses (target) which
had to be counted. Stimulus duration was 100 ms, the interstimulus interval varied randomly
between 800 and 1000 ms. The oddball task is a standard paradigm and generates robust ERP
components: VEPs at occipital sites which are generated in the visual cortex when visual
stimuli are presented. The P300 at centroparietal sites (around CPz, Pz) when attention is
shifted to a target stimulus. Stimuli were presented asynchronous to the temporal pattern of the
rowing movement on a computer screen besides the ergometer using the Presentation software
(Neurobehavioral Systems, www.neurobs.com), allowing to monitor the display without head
movements, although eye movement artifacts may be generated. Alternatively, an acoustical
stimulation could be used. However, because the auditory cortex is closer to the sensorimotor
cortex and to the mastoids than the visual cortex, this will probably lead to extended signal
overlay of motor-related and auditory-evoked potentials. The EEG was analyzed using the
Vision Analyzer 1.0 software (BrainProducts, Gilching, Germany). EEG data were digitally
filtered with a 16 Hz/24 dB Butterworth zero phase lowpass, segmented into epochs of -200
ms to 800 ms around stimulus onset (oddball task), and baseline corrected (-200 to 0 ms). After
applying a semiautomatic procedure for artifact detection (amplitude criterion ±100 μV,
gradient 25 μV/sample) the complete datasets were inspected visually for further artifacts
surviving the automatic rejection. Segments with blink or eye movement artifacts (detectable
at frontal sites) were excluded completely. Traces of single channels containing other clearly
visible large artifacts were removed. If there were more than five contaminated traces, the
whole segment was removed. ERPs were computed for each stimulus category of the oddball
task. Motor-related ERPs were computed triggered by the force onset at the beginning of the
rowing stroke. Rowing force was measured with a modified ergometer handle using strain
gauges (according to the measure of oar forces in rowing; Hill, 2002) and movement of the
sliding seat was measured with a potentiometer. Biomechanical data were recorded with a
second computer, synchronised using triggers of the Presentation software, and added to the
EEG data file offline.
Before performing this pilot study, a statement of the ethics committee of the German
Society of Psychology was obtained for a grant proposal. This stated no ethical concerns about
this type of investigations. Written informed consent was obtained (respectively from a parent
when under 18). Three male subjects (aged 47, 13, and 10 years, and referred to here as: H, J,
and M respectively) performed (i) the oddball task sitting still on the ergometer, (ii) rowing
without stimulation, and (iii) the oddball task during rowing. Subjects were instructed to row
in a recreational mode (e.g., 130 W for subject H) during the oddball task and to keep rowing
power and stroke rate (20/min) constant, using the performance monitor of the ergometer for
control. The rest condition of the oddball task was always performed first to avoid sweating
artifacts.

2.2. Results
Fig. 2 displays ERPs of all three subjects for the oddball task. Especially the VEPs were
very similar between rowing and rest, and intraindividual differences were much smaller than
the interindividual differences. This result demonstrates that standard ERPs not time-locked to
the rowing movement can be measured during rowing, despite the fact that subjects M and J
had no or only marginal rowing experience. In contrast, the motor-related ERPs were very
noisy and showed large artifacts with large inter- and intraindividual (implemented by varying
force output and stroke rate) differences and were therefore not interpretable. One observable
source of large artifacts was due to movements of the cable connecting the head-mounted
preamplifier with the second amplifier unit, which led to movements of the preamplifier and
electrode cables.

Fig. 2. ERPs of the visual oddball task comparing rowing and rest for all three subjects (M, J,
and H) of pilot Study 1. Upper graphs: VEPs evoked by the frequent checkerboard stimulus at
electrode site Iz (referenced to Cz to obtain a larger and cleaner signal because VEP activity
and EMG artifacts are lower at Cz compared to the mastoids). Below: the P300 waveform at
Pz/CPz (linked mastoid reference for M and H, and right mastoid for J due to the lost left
mastoid channel). The vertical line marks the stimulus onset. The numbers at the bottom of
each graph present the percentage of artifact-free trials included in the averages for rowing and
rest of the chosen electrode site and the correlation coefficients (Pearson) of the two
waveforms. The high dropout rate for subject H was mainly due to eyeblink artifacts. For
subject M three channels (FCz, CPz, and CP4) were lost completely due to artifacts during
rowing: for subject J the left mastoid channel was lost. Furthermore, a P300 is missing during
rest for J because he did not count the target because of an imprecisely given instruction. For
M and H the P300 was larger during rest. The ERPs of the deviant stimulus condition are not
displayed because they showed results similar to those of the frequent condition.

3. Pilot Study 2
3.1. Materials and Methods
The second approach used a system with active electrodes at the Department of
Psychology, University of Frankfurt. This system suppresses artifacts due to cable movements,
however electrode movements cannot be avoided completely. During rowing and rest the
amplifiers were worn in a backpack and connected via fibre-optic cables to a PC. EEG was
recorded continuously with BrainAmp DC amplifiers (BrainProducts, Gilching, Germany;
sample rate 250 Hz, resolution 0.1 μV/bit, input impedance 10 MOhm) using an equidistant
EasyCap (EasyCap GmbH, Herrsching-Breitbrunn, Germany, www.easycap.de) with 62
sintered Ag/AgCl electrodes and built-in preamplifiers (BrainProducts ActiCap System). Eye
blinks and movements were monitored with supra- and infra-orbital electrodes and with
electrodes on the external canthi. The vertex electrode was used as the reference. To avoid
injuries due to skin abrasion, electrode impedances were kept at 20 kOhm which is more than
sufficient from electrical engineering principles (Ferree et al., 2001; see Picton et al., 2000).
The EEG was analyzed like in Study 1 with slightly different filter settings (0.5 to 20 Hz
bandpass). The averages were rereferenced (average reference transformation; Bertrand et al.,
1985), and the reconstructed vertex reference was added to the data, resulting in 61 EEG
channels. The ergometer and its measuring equipment and the experimental procedure were
the same as in Study 1. The task was performed by two female students (F and K, aged 24 and
26), without rowing experience and an experienced male rower (H, aged 50). Written informed
consent was obtained. Subjects rowed in a recreational mode during the oddball task with a
stroke rate of 20/min.
3.2. Results
Fig. 3 displays ERPs of all three subjects for the oddball task. As in Study 1, the VEPs
were very similar between rowing and rest, the P300 was smaller during rowing, and the
intraindividual differences were much smaller than the interindividual differences.
Motor-related activity, on the other hand, was not dominated by the expected motor
potential in all conditions. Applying an ICA-based artifact rejection procedure improved the
data quality somewhat but insufficiently, probably because movement artifacts are not stable
enough over time, which is a prerequisite for computing the ICA components. Performing only
the arm pull revealed for subject H a bilateral negativity; however, for subjects F and K it
revealed no interpretable results. For normal rowing a negative activation at central sites,
indicating a motor potential, appeared, but at peripheral electrode sites large activities occurred
which were only partly corrected using ICA. One possible source for artifacts in this study
were electrode movements due to cable drag because cables were not fixed to the cap.
In summary, this pilot study revealed results similar to those of Study 1. Standard ERPs
can be measured reliably during rowing, however motor-related activity is largely distorted by
remaining artifact sources.

Fig. 3. ERPs of the visual oddball task comparing rowing and rest for all three subjects (F, K,
and H) of pilot Study 2. Upper graphs: VEPs evoked by the frequent checkerboard stimulus at
electrode site Oz (average referenced). Below: the P300 waveform at CPz, which was larger
during rest. The vertical line marks the stimulus onset. The numbers at the bottom of each
graph present the percentage of artifact-free trials included in the averages for rowing and rest
of the chosen electrode site and the correlation coefficients. The high dropout rate for subject
H was due to eyeblink/eyemovement artifacts. After an ICA-based correction, about 98% of
the trials could be kept, resulting in very similar ERPs. For subject F the data loss at occipital
sites was due to neck muscle activity. Deviant stimulus condition is not shown.
4. Pilot Study 3
4.1. Materials and Methods
Disadvantages of the two systems used in the previous pilot studies were the amount of
required equipment and the data transmission via cable connections. Therefore, a study of
Debener et al. (2012) was very promising. They used a new developed wireless system
(Emotiv, www.emotiv.com). After making some technical improvements they measured ERPs
in subjects walking around. The Emotiv system integrates the hardware in a small and
lightweight headset, in combination with a wireless data transmission via an USB dongle to a
laptop or even an Android smartphone (Stopczynski et al., 2014). Furthermore, this system
integrates a two-axis gyroscope which measures head rotations. Electrodes and cables of the
Emotiv system are fixed to stiff plastic arms which should be effective to reduce artifacts by
cable and electrode movements. Acceptable limitations of the Emotiv system, at least for pilot
studies, are the fixed and lower sample rate and resolution and the lower number of channels
(14). In addition, the sensor locations cannot be changed and are not well suited to sensorimotor
research. Therefore, as already practised by Debener et al. (2012), this system was modified by
removing the original sensors and plastic arms and connecting the system to the electrode cap
with the gold electrodes used in Study 1 (Fig. 4). Comparison studies revealed that the Emotiv
system (equipped with the cheap original electrodes) performs less accurate than a medical
device, however is able to record EEG data in a satisfying manner (Duvinage et al., 2013;
Badcock et al., 2013). Comparing a modified (according to Debener et al., 2012) Emotiv

System with a commercial SynAmps System revealed only small differences, with a marginal
worse performance of the modified Emotiv System (Barham et al., 2017).
A 14-channel EEG covering mainly the sensorimotor area (electrode sites AFz, Fz,
FCz, Cz, CPz, Pz, FC1, FC2, CP1, CP2, C3, C4, O1 to assess VEPs, left mastoid, and reference
right mastoid) was recorded using the Emotiv system (fixed settings: sample rate 128 Hz,
resolution 14 bit/0.51 μV, bandpass filter 0.2 - 45 Hz, notch 50/60 Hz, digital 5th order Sinc
filter, data transmission 2.4 GHz band, and operation distance measured outside about 10 m).
Signal quality was controlled with the Emotiv Testbench recording software. The ergometer,
its measuring equipment, and the oddball task (except a reduction of the number of standard
stimuli from 180 to 120) were the same as in Study 1. The synchronisation of the EEG data
with the biomechanical data and the visual stimulation was somewhat difficult. Although the
Emotiv system can read trigger signals from a serial port, the laptops used did not have serial
ports. An interface with serial-to-USB adaptors is not accurate enough in timing. Therefore,
the Presentation scenarios were modified for synchronisation. A photodiode was fixed to the
Presentation laptop and activated by stimuli at the beginning and the end of each experimental
run. The triggers sent via the parallel port were recorded with an USB analog-digital device
(RedLab 1208 LS, Meilhaus, Puchheim/Germany) together with the biomechanical data (force
of the rowing stroke and movement of the sliding seat). The signal of the photodiode (which
was much larger than the EEG) was recorded with one EEG channel, and the cables were
removed during the experimental runs. The EEG, biomechanical data, and triggers of the
oddball stimulation were synchronised offline using purpose-written software. A separate
channel for received data packets implemented in the Emotiv system provides the ability to
control for lost data. This infomation was used to correct the synchronisation (a small fraction
of samples was lost in 4 of 25 datasets). The EEG was analyzed in a way similar to that used
in Study 1 (using only a 20 Hz lowpass filter). Data of the rowing condition of two subjects
had a larger number of trials contaminated with eye blinks. These were corrected successfully
using ICA without affecting other activities (despite the low spatial resolution relying on only
14 channels can be critical to apply the ICA procedure).
Four male subjects (aged 55, 21, 18, and 14 years, and referred to here as H, J, M, D),
with ergometer rowing skills allowing a high performance were instructed to perform six
experimental conditions as follows: (i) oddball-rest; (ii) rowing with arm pull only (power 50
W, stroke rate (SR) 30/min); (iii) rowing 100 W/SR 20/min; (iv) oddball-rowing 100 W/SR
20/min; (v) rowing 180-200 W/SR 20/min; (vi) rowing 180-200 W/SR 26/min. Power and
stroke rates could be controlled with the monitor of the ergometer and were close to the
instruction. The rowing power ranged from recreational to long distance endurance rowing.
For subject D the planned power thresholds were reduced to 60%. Written informed consent
was obtained (respectively from a parent when under 18).
4.2. Results
Fig. 5 displays ERPs of all four subjects for the oddball task. As in studies 1 and 2, the
VEPs were very similar between rowing and rest, the P300 was smaller during rowing, and the
intraindividual differences were much smaller than the interindividual differences.
The motor-related activity showed more or less large artifacts at several sites, as well
as the expected modulation by rowing force at some other sites -- that is a larger negative
activity with increasing force during the rowing stroke -- with some differences between
subjects (Fig. 6). As it can be difficult to differentiate between motor-related activity and
movement-related artifacts at sensorimotor sites, movement-related artifacts can clearly be
identified at sites outside the sensorimotor region. Fig. 5 displays such an example for subject

J at electrode site O1. The VEP for the frequent stimulus of the oddball task was computed
separately for the drive and recovery phases of the rowing movement (stimuli presented in the
transition drive-recovery were excluded for this analysis). These waveforms were overlaid by
large movement-related artifacts with reversed polarity which cancelled each other out in the
average including all trials. These artifacts were independent of the chosen reference (Cz, right
mastoid, and linked mastoids). That is, the overlay does not depend on physiological motor
activity, which is much stronger at Cz than at the mastoids and O1; instead, it must be generated
at electrode O1. Probably this was due to cable artifacts in an electromagnetically noisy
environment. Furthermore, the electrodes O1, left mastoid, and AFz had the largest distance to
the Emotiv connector and therefore the longest cables, which may have allowed small
movements.
To identify one possible source of movement artifacts, the gyroscope of the Emotiv
system was used to test if artifacts are caused by head movements. Therefore, rapid repeated
movements were performed (left turn, right turn, and nodding) revealing very large artifacts,
especially at lateral sites where the impact of the head movement was larger than at central
sites. Using ICA these artefacts could be strongly attenuated (Fig. 7). A comparison of the
gyroscope data for these head rotations and rowing showed only small head movements for
nodding during rowing: that is, head rotations and the associated artifacts are not critical for
rowing.
In summary, this pilot Study 3 revealed results similar to those of Studies 1 and 2.
Standard ERPs can be measured reliably during rowing, however motor-related activity is
largely distorted by remaining artifact sources, whereas the use of, although modified, passive
electrodes may be a limiting factor.Fig. 4. The modified Emotiv system combined with a
standard electrode cap. A connector was fixed above the part of the headset containing the
amplifier circuits. The two cables connected the headset with the photodiode used for
synchronisation of stimulation and EEG recording at the start and end of each experimental
run. During rowing the cables were removed.

Deviant stimulus condition is not shown. For the frequent stimulus of subject J, the ERPs of
the rowing condition, separated into drive (with force) and recovery phases of the rowing
movement (without excluding artifactual trials), are presented additionally. In this recording
the VEP at electrode site O1 was overlaid by large movement-related drift artifacts, which
cancelled each other out when all trials (drive and recovery) are included in the average
waveform.

few EEG segments showing excessive and clearly identifiable artifacts (e.g., voltage jumps)
were excluded.

Fig. 7. Movement artifacts generated by repeated rapid head rotations (measured with the
gyroscope) at left mastoid (LM, where the artefact was largest) and right mastoid (RM, both
sites referenced to Cz). Rotations to the right side: black lines; rotations to the left side: grey
lines. The polarity was inverted between left and right electrode sites and between left and right
head rotations. This artefact was present (with comparable amplitudes) at left sites C3 and O1,
at right sites C4, FC2, CP2, and RM, and at O1, Fz, and AFz. Using ICA-based correction the
artefact could be removed nearly completely (dotted lines). The gyroscope was not calibrated
(arbitrary units).
5. Pilot Study 4
Under combining the technical advantages of Study 2 (active electrodes) and Study 3
(mobile headset), Study 4 followed two aims: (i) can movement artifacts be reduced when the
passive electrodes of Study 3 are replaced by active electrodes, and can movement-related
ERPs be measured in sufficient quality then? This would be the optimal result. (ii) If the first
aim is not achieved: how is the signal quality of standard VEPs affected by movement
dynamics (force output) and movement kinematics (movement speed). That is, is there a tradeoff between signal quality and movement intensity in the measurement of ERPs in e.g.
cognitive tasks in moving subjects.
5.1. Materials and Methods
The Emotiv system used in Study 3 was combined with eight active electrodes
(EasyCap active) which were provided by EasyCap GmbH (www.easycap.de) together with
electrode caps (EasyCap). In contrast to the older version of the Acticap electrodes used in
Study 2 these electrodes are smaller and very flat, and should therefore be less susceptible to
tilting movements generated by inertial forces. After pretests electrode cables were shortened,
fixed to the cap and connected to the headset. Power for the electrodes was provided by a 9 V
battery attached to the connector (Fig. 8). The electrodes were fixed with adaptors and a highly
viscous conductive paste (Nihon-Kohden Elefix). The active electrodes were placed at
positions Cz, FCz, C4', C3', O1, left and right mastoid (TP9, TP10), focusing the measure of
motor-related activity and the VEP. The active reference electrode was placed at AFz for
different reasons: (i) by generating eye blinks it could be controlled if all electrodes worked
properly, (ii) sections with eye blink and vertical eye movement artifacts could be detected and
removed from the EEG data, (iii) a mastoid reference is largely affected by EMG artifacts
generated by neck and head muscles, (iv) the spatial distance to occipital sites is largest and
allows to measure larger VEPs. A disposable baby-ECG electrode, which served as
ground/DRL, was placed at the right anterior temple. The original passive ground electrode of
the EasyCap-active system was used as a signal electrode and placed at Oz. Of course it is
unusual to combine a passive electrode with an active reference electrode and it was not sure

if it works because the amplifier would saturate if the impedances are very different. However
this electrode always provided a clear EEG signal and no saturation effects were observed in
any measure. Therefore the quality of the VEP measured with the active electrode at O1 could
be directly compared with the VEP measured with the passive electrode at Oz. Signal quality
was controlled with the Emotiv Testbench recording software. The recording parameters (A-D
rate 128 Hz, bandpass filter 0.2 - 45 Hz) ergometer and its measuring equipment, and the
oddball task were the same as in Study 3 except two modifications. The condition with the 60
deviant stimuli of the previous studies was removed because the VEPs did not differ from the
standard checkerboard task. The number of trials of the latter was therefore increased from 120
to 180. Secondly, because from one subject no VEP signal was obtained, a second recording
session was conducted at a later time (with a nearly identical rowing performance). To ensure
that the visual stimulation was observed, the target stimulus (cross) was replaced by a lower
number (27-33) of pictures of different airplanes. This was done because the oddball task was
repeated six times instead of two times in the previous studies and therefore more salient stimuli
were used. In this Study 4 the target condition of the oddball task was only used to control
performance.
The same four male subjects as in Study 3 (aged 19, 23, 26, and 59 years, height 180190 cm, weight 80-84 kg) performed six experimental conditions of about four minutes
duration comparable to Study 3: (i) rowing with lower force output and lower stroke rate; (ii)
lower force output, higher stroke rate; (ii) higher force output, lower stroke rate; (iv) higher
force output, higher stroke rate; (v) visual stimulation in rest (without rowing); (vi) rowing
with arm pull only (details are provided in the legend of Fig. 10). Power and stroke rates could
be controlled with the performance monitor of the ergometer and were close to the instruction.
The rowing power ranged from recreational (condition i) to long distance (e.g. 10 km) racing
(condition iv). The visual stimulation was applied in all six conditions. For comparison, one
subject repeated all six conditions with the cap used in Study 3 with 14 passive electrodes.
Data processing was performed as in Study 3, using Vision Analyzer 2.1 (20 Hz
lowpass filtering, segment lengths 1 s for VEPs, 3 s movement related, 2 s condition 6). VEPs
were analysed at electrode sites O1 and Oz (referenced to Cz like in Study 3). The number of
included trials (total 180) was on average 138 (O1) and 140 (Oz) (range 88-176). Movementrelated activity was analysed relative to force onset and referenced to AFz. The number of
rowing strokes was on average (across subjects and conditions) 104 (range 84-117). The
number of included trials (sites C3, C4, Cz, FCz) was on average 63 (range 20-117). Excluded
trials were mainly contaminated by ocular artifacts. Due to the low number of channels an ICAbased artifact correction was not performed. The number of included trials in the movementrelated condition was lower as in the VEP condition because of the longer segments (3 s vs. 1
s). One recording (subject D) was made on a hot August day. This resulted in large sweating
artifacts, starting in condition three. Therefore, for the VEP analysis data of all recordings were
filtered with a 1-Hz/24 dB highpass. This filtering did not visibly affect the morphology of the
VEP waveform. For the analysis of the movement-related activity no additional highpassfiltering was made because at stroke rate 20/min movement frequency is about 0.33 Hz.

5.2. Results
Fig. 9a displays the VEPs generated by the standard stimulation (checkerboard) of the
oddball task for all four subjects and conditions. For direct comparison, the VEP measured at
active electrode O1 and passive electrode Oz are superimposed. As in the previous studies the
VEPs were similar between rowing and rest, and the intraindividual differences were much
smaller than the interindividual differences. Remarkably, the VEP measured at O1 and Oz were
highly congruent. Fig. 9b displays the Standard Deviations (SD) of the EEG segments from
which the average VEP was computed for all subjects and the six conditions. SDs were smallest
in condition five (rest) and largest in the high intensive rowing condition four (except subject
J). The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was computed in addition and revealed a similar pattern
than the SD, that is the highest SNR in condition five and the lowest in condition four. However
SD as well as SNR values could be misleading, if an average waveform is dominated by a large
and systematic artifact. Nevertheless these data show that the qualitiy of the ERP is lower when
movement intensity increases, as is indicated in the VEP waveforms as well.
Fig. 10 displays the motor-related activity at Cz. The waveforms show a systematic
modulation by force output (and probably force-related artifacts) but not by movement speed
(stroke rate). However the large interindividual differences are physiologically less plausible.
In summary, as shown in the previous studies, standard VEPs can be measured reliably
during rowing whereas signal quality decreases when movement intensity increases. The
differences between the VEP measured at active electrode O1 and passive electrode Oz are
marginal to small. This shows that the use of active electrodes does not considerably suppress
movement artifacts when electrode cables are shortened and fixated and a head-mounted
amplifier is used. Consequently, the motor-related activity is still distorted by remaining
artifacts.

(26.1-28.6), 225-270 W. Condition six: armpull only (stroke rate 26.2-29.1), 50-57.5 W.
6. General Discussion
The present pilot studies tested the practicability of four different EEG acquisition
systems for ERP measures in moving subjects. Technically, including the modifications, the
used systems were suited to measure ERPs in moving subjects in contrast to conventional
laboratory EEG hardware with passive electrodes. The advantages of the used systems were
the head-mounted amplifier (studies 1, 3, and 4) and the active electrodes (studies 2 and 4),
both methods reducing cable movement artifacts. A further advantage of meanwhile available
systems with low weight and small dimensions for movement research resp. research on
moving subjects is either wireless data transmission or storing the data on a SD-card in the
device itself.
The data from fourteen single case measures from six different subjects revealed for a
standard paradigm (visual oddball task) comparable intraindividual ERPs during rowing and
during rest (non-movement condition) in all cases, despite remaining artifacts in the data. EEG
parameters and ERP waveforms are genetically determined and show generally a broad range

of interindividual differences, but are also remarkably stable over time in adult subjects
(Stassen et al., 1998; Weisbrod et al., 2004). This fact (although probably not well known),
strongly supports the reliability of the data, because the intraindividual differences were much
smaller than the interindividual differences. Higher intraindividual differences instead would
indicate that the ERP pattern are largely distorted by movement artifacts.
Whereas the VEPs were quite similar, the P300 was smaller during rowing than during
rest (studies 1-3). This may be partly due to a habituation effect (the rest condition was always
performed before the rowing condition), like recently suggested by Scanlon et al. (2017) as
well, who used also an oddball task to compare ERP measures during indoor cycling with a
resting condition. Another contribution to this effect was probably that multiple task demands
reduce the P300 (e.g., as reviewed by Polich, 2007). Here, attention is divided by counting the
targets on the one hand and performing the rowing movement and the monitoring of stroke rate
and power output on the other hand, which may be demanding for nonskilled rowers. Similar
results with about a 30% smaller P300 amplitude during walking compared to sitting still (in
counterbalanced order) were reported by Debener et al. (2012) and De Vos et al. (2014), who
also suggested that the different task demands were the reason for this result. However, it has
to be emphasised that the aim of the present pilot studies was not to investigate cognitive
processes in rowing, instead these robust ERP components (VEPs, P300) were measured for
methodological reasons, that is to compare ERP data quality during rowing and rest in a
repeated measure design.
The positive results of the oddball task are promising for the investigation of brain
functions in naturally behaving subjects outside the laboratory: for example in cognition
research, brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, ambulatory assessment, and others.
Since rowing is a very athletic sport and therefore a source of large movement-related artifacts,
ERP measures with less motor activity such as walking around (e.g., Debener et al., 2012) or
cycling when pedaling slowly at a subaerobic level (Scanlon et al., 2017) can easily be obtained
using suitable equipment.
Due to the nature of ecological settings more limitations compared to laboratory
settings have to be accepted. The placement of the stimulation monitor besides the ergometer
and the oscillating viewing distance may be regarded as critical. Alternatives might be the use
of a head-up display or an acoustical stimulation. However the gyroscope data in studies 3 and
4 revealed only small head movements in the oddball task during rowing, therefore it can be
concluded that this was comparable in Study 1 and 2 because the placement of the monitor was
the same. Eye movements were marginal or not present in the high densitiy recording of Study
2 but could be monitored at frontal sites in the other studies as well.
The (slight) differences in hardware and filter settings, and electrode positions were
acceptable because reliability was assessed by the within-subject comparisons for each study
separately.
The small sample size of these four pilot studies may be seen as critical from a classical
cognitive neuroscience point of view. However it has to be noted that no subtle cognitive
processes were investigated which require a larger sample size. Instead, robust
electrophysiological (i) and physical (ii) processes were investigated which were seen in all
fourteen measures. That is (i) VEPs were obtained during rowing and rest in all measures.
And (ii) it was not possible to measure clean movement related neuronal activities. That is the
chosen technical setup clearly differentiates between possibilities and limitations.
The second and more challenging aim of the four studies was to test if motor-related
activity could be measured. This approach is unique for these pilot studies as the cited studies
in the introduction aimed to measure cognitive processing in movement conditions, not the

movement itself. Although motor potentials during the drive phase of the rowing movement,
modulated by force output, were indicated (cf. Figure 6 and 10), in all four studies large
movement-related artifacts occurred which distorted motor-related activity. These artifacts can
be identified at electrode sites apart from the pre- and primary motor cortex. In this context it
has to be considered that artifacts originating from the reference electrode will affect the other
electrodes. As the classical mastoid reference captures EMG activity of head and neck muscles,
reference electrode positions less affected by this EMG activity, as well as the activity of
cortical motor areas, may be better suited (e.g. prefrontal sites or nose tip). At sites covering
the motor areas artifacts are more difficult to detect because muscle force generation,
movement kinematics, and movement-related artifacts have the same time course. Therefore,
further technical improvements to reduce artifacts beforehand or to identify artifacts better (cf.
Castermans et al., 2014) and correct them are necessary to investigate motor behavior in
movements including the whole body (as in sports: for example, motor learning or
differentiating high from low performance in movement execution). One example to identify
artifact sources was given in Study 3 when using the gyroscope to identify artifacts generated
by rapid head movements.
Known artifact sources are the EMG activity and sweating artifacts. The latter cannot
be filtered out when movement frequency is in the same range (like in one subject of Study 4).
Other sources of artifacts may rely on small movements of the electrode cables relative to the
cap which were still possible; and the translational head movement during rowing in an
electromagnetically noisy environment (the room was not shielded) may have generated small
currents in the cables, as in a generator (according to Faraday’s law). However in both cases
the active electrodes should be less vulnerable to this artifact sources. Furthermore, for the
second case, artifacts should be larger when movement speed increases which was not
observed.
To investigate further possible sources of motion artifacts, Oliveira et al. (2016) used a
phantom head to simulate motion artifacts in EEG data and found that artifacts increased with
movement frequency as well as with movement amplitude, that is in general with the
acceleration of the phantom head. “We speculate that the major source of such artifacts is
micro-movement of the recording electrodes in relation to the scalp surface“ (Oliveira et al.,
2016). Their data showed that artifacts strongly increased when the head acceleration was
larger than 1.5 g. Based on these results, additional measures of head acceleration using a
triaxial acceleration sensor (Move II, Movisens GmbH, Karlsruhe/Germany,
www.movisens.com) attached to the Emotiv headset were analysed. These revealed values
between 0.85 g in low intensive rowing (75 W, 20 strokes/min) and 2.5 g in high intensive
rowing (360 W, 30 strokes/min). That is the lower quality of VEPs in Study 4 at the rowing
conditions with higher intensity may partly depend on such micro-movements of the electrodes,
independently if passive or active electrodes are used because the main advantage of active
electrodes is that these are less susceptible for cable sway artifacts.
Another pitfall with a physiological origin might be, that different neuronal activities
are superimposed which hinders the detection of relevant activities. Siemonow et al. (2000)
observed that the amplitude of the motor potential correlates very high (r = 0.93) with force
output in an isometric elbow flexion task and reported values of up to 8 μV/150 N. In rowing
these values (assuming a physiological source) are considerably higher (about 100 μV and 1000
N in Study 4). In contrast to these, probably from the pyramidal cells in the primary motor
cortex generated efferent activities (Brecht et al., 2004; Shibasaki, 2012), are other motorrelated activities (originating from the premotor cortex or the SMA) very small. E.g. in two
own visuomotor tracking studies the effects related to motor learning were below 1 μV (Hill,

2009, 2014). That is, if generally the activities related to motor learning or motor programming
(e.g. in rowing the perception and adaptation of within-crew differences of rowing technique,
Hill, 2002) are in this amplitude range, these will be hidden when the activity related to force
execution is much higher.
