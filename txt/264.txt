ABSTRACT

Article history:

Post-stroke patients need ongoing rehabilitation to restore dysfunction caused
by an attack so that a monitoring device is required. EEG signals reflect
electrical activity in the brain, which also informs the condition of post-stroke
patient recovery. However, the EEG signal processing model needs to
provide information on the post-stroke state. The development of deep
learning allows it to be applied to the identification of post-stroke patients.
This study proposed a method for identifying post-stroke patients using
convolutional neural networks (CNN). Wavelet is used for EEG signal
information extraction as a feature of machine learning, which reflects
the condition of post-stroke patients. This feature is Delta, Alpha, Beta,
Theta, and Mu waves. Moreover, the five waves, amplitude features are also
added according to the characteristics of the post-stroke EEG signal.
The results showed that the feature configuration is essential as distinguish.
The accuracy of the testing data was 90% with amplitude and Beta features
compared to 70% without amplitude or Beta. The experimental results also
showed that adaptive moment estimation (Adam) optimization model was
more stable compared to Stochastic gradient descent (SGD). But SGD can
provide higher accuracy than the Adam model.

INTRODUCTION
Stroke more often leaves disability than death. Stroke is the third-largest cause of disability in
the world [1]. It is the number one cause of death in Indonesia based on the results of research published by
the Health Research and Development Agency (Balitbangkes) in 2015. Therefore, medical rehabilitation
is essential to restore post-stroke patients in independence to take care of them and carry out daily life
activities. In stroke rehabilitation, there is a standard clinical procedure, namely the National Institute of
Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), to determine the current condition of patients [2]. The NIHSS tool can be an
evaluation of the rehabilitation of stroke patients. NIHSS uses 11 indicators for post-stroke patients, namely
the level of consciousness, eye gaze, vision, facial paralysis, hand and foot movements, joint inflammation,
sensory abilities, language disorders, speech disorders, and sensory abilities. In each indicator, there is an
assessment of the score between 0-4. But some variable use range 0-2. Scoring informs five levels of stroke,
namely, score 0 no indication of a stroke at all (No Stroke), score 1-4 mild stroke (Minor Stroke),
score 5-15 medium stroke (Moderate Stroke), score 16-20 medium stroke towards severe stroke, and 21-42
severe strokes [3].

Stroke can be detected by several instruments, such as CT scan, MRI, electroencephalogram (EEG),
and EMG. CT scan and MRI are usually for the first treatment detection. The computational capabilities,
automatically neurorehabilitation, can use EMG [4] and EEG [5]. EEG records reflect brain function.
The instrument can provide supporting information in identifying and monitoring different neurological
rehabilitation [5]. EEG has advantages in low cost and minimal risk to patients, but it is necessary to
process to inform the brain's condition properly. Some studies used EEG signals to identify ischemic stroke
patients [6], investigate that stroke patients are able to use BCI [7], and extracted significant variable [8].
EEG signal processing consists of two essential factors that are feature extraction and identification [9].
Usually, the neurologist reads the EEG signal of a post-stroke patient by observing wave density or rhythm,
amplitude, asymmetric, change in magnitude, the presence of waves, and the ratio between waves. The most
important thing is how to extract the signal into frequency components. The next step is to choose waves
with the right frequency component under the characteristics of the EEG signal variable being reviewed [10].
Therefore, research using frequency extraction is beneficial. Several previous studies used Wavelet extraction
to determine the significant variables of EEG signals for post-stroke patients [8]. Wavelet can extract Alpha,
Beta, Theta, Gamma, and Mu waves to classify emotions of stroke patients [11] and healthy
people [12]. Also, wavelet provides easy time-frequency analysis. Past research shows that the study of
the time-frequency of stroke patients during TMS therapy [13]. Many other studies have also looked at
the characteristics of waves with a specific frequency in stroke patients [14], which is one characteristic.
Previous studies used Wavelet extraction of EEG signals to find significant variables of stroke [8] and
the classification of emotions [15]. In meanwhile, FFT is suitable for identifying EEG signal asymmetries [16].
Machine learning allows computers to learn like humans make computers learn EEG stroke patterns
previously so that automatic detection. Deep learning is part of machine learning, which in recent years has
shown remarkable performance. Popular methods used in deep learning are convolutional neural network
(CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). Both have enough accuracy and are subject to composition.
However, RNN is vulnerable to feature sequences, which can result in decreased correctness. Previous
studies using a network similar to CNN, namely DBN, for the classification of slow cortical potentials in
stroke [14]. CNN is widely used for image processing. An EEG signal can be viewed as an image, so its
processing uses two-dimensional CNN, like previous studies for the detection of epileptic attacks [17].
However, not a few are also used for signal processing using one dimension. Some researchers used to
identify EEG signals between stroke patients and healthy people [18], ischemic detection [19]. Another study
to analyze epileptiform spikes on EEG signals [17] and motor imagery (MI) detection [20]. After undergoing
rehabilitation, the post-stroke patient is expected to be healthy or have no stroke. NIHSS scales can be
the standard for determining stroke levels from several indicators. But for the “minor” and “no stroke” levels,
there is a slight difference. Therefore, we need another instrument, such as the EEG. This study proposed
the CNN method for classifying EEG signals against post-stroke patients into both classes. The computational
model of the EEG signal is built through wavelet extraction to get the right frequency range. EEG signals
were extracted classified using CNN.

2.1. Data acquisition
EEG signal data is recorded using Emotiv Epoch+ with a sampling frequency of 128 Hz from 14
channels, i.e., AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8. As subjects were 50 outpatients in
the neurology clinic of RSIB hospital [8]. As a control group of the "No Stroke" class, recorded EEG signals
from 25 healthy volunteers. Control groups are also used to identify strokes using portable EEG [16]
and identified ischemic stroke [19]. At the rate 80% of all subjects as training data and 20% as non-training
data. Each patient follows the instruction in Figure 2 to generate the appropriate waves. From 180 seconds of
recording, the data used is only 120 seconds by removing 30 seconds beginning and ending.

2.2. Wavelet extraction
Wavelet transformation aims to split signals in two frequency ranges, approximation and detail or as
frequency filter. The method is appropriate for non-stationary signals such as EEG [21]. Basis function (n)

where j and k are an integer that indicates the scaling and dilate of the basis function. It depends on the shape
or position of the signal. (n) is the wavelet family.
Signals with a 128 Hz sampling frequency may have a frequency component of 1-64 Hz or half.
Each decomposition will be the half frequency signal as an approximation and a detail component. If it is
repeated several steps, it can be extracted from Alpha or Mu waves, Theta, Delta wave, as in Figure 3.

Where j and k are an integer that indicates the scaling and dilate of the basis function. It depends on the shape
or position of the signal. (n) is the wavelet family. The feature extraction of the EEG signal is obtained by
convolution, which also decomposes the signal to several levels. A previous study used Symlet2 to eliminate
noise and get the desired signal that is Gamma, Beta, Alpha, Theta, and Mu wave [8]. EEG signal wave
extraction can use fast Fourier transform (FFT) or wavelet transformation. Wavelet capability is better for
non-stationary signals such as EEG signals [22]. Wavelet extraction helps distinguish EEG signals, so that
provide good accuracy [21].

2.3. Convolution neural network
CNN has the potential to process data in the time domain, such as an EEG signal [17]. In pattern
recognition, what is very important is the extraction of EEG signals into features that match the classification
variable. Some studies related to stroke using Alpha, Beta, Theta, and Delta waves [6, 20], other studies
using brain symmetric index and relative frequency band ratio [23], frequency bands [24] and their
comparisons [25], amplitude, rhythm [24] and MI [26]. This research used Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta waves,
MI, and amplitude based on a previous study [8]. Refer to Figure 2; the first 30 seconds during eye-opening
contain Delta, Theta, Alpha, and Beta waves (1-32 Hz). As Figure 3, there are 64 points every second.
Meanwhile, when the MI relation to Mu wave, that is 720 points. While the last 30 seconds raises the Alpha
wave, which is 720 seconds. By adding the amplitude feature, the configuration as in Table 1.
Amplitude takes average each 0.0625-second segment or 8 points per second. In Table 1, all features
are on each channel, except for the Mu wave feature. So specifically, FC5 and FC6 channels have 3.960
points, while another channel has 3240 points. So there are 46.800 features. All features will normalize to
reduce bias and get better learning [27]. In this study, normalization was carried out in a range of numbers
between -1 and 1 to equalize the maximum and minimum values of each channel.

CNN consists of a convolution layer for extracting features and classification layers for learning, as
in Figure 4. Usually, the classification or identification layer uses the multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture. In previous studies, CNN was used to identify ischemic stroke patients and no stroke people
throughout looking at EEG signals into one-dimensional objects [17, 18]. While in other studies, CNN was
used to identify MI [28], and ECG [29]. The feature generated by this layer will be input into the CNN
identification layer through training first. In learning, there are several ways to correct weights, such as
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or adaptive moment estimation (Adam). AdaDelta has a way of working
similar to adaptive backpropagation, which has been used for BCI [30].

2.3.1. Feature extraction layer
The layers contained in feature extraction are useful for translating input into a feature based on
the data in the form of a vector. This feature extraction layer consists of a convolution layer and a sub
sampling (pooling) layer. The hyper parameters of the convolution are depth, stride, and zero-padding, as
shown in (4). The output of this layer is used to the next process, namely the subsampling process of each ml
map of the matrix with the size of m x n and kernel function C calculated in rows k and column y in the first
convolution layer.

Where Kh is height, and Kw is the length of the kernel. Then rl and cl are the length and height of the kernel
layer index l, and C is the convolution kernel. After the convolution process, then the next is the activation
process using the rectified linear units (ReLU), which is useful for normalizing all negative values to
zero using (5).
Next, the downsampling or pooling layer serves to reduce the number of parameters from
the feature map that will be used in the classification layer. Also, pooling speeds up computing and controls
overfitting. Downsampling is accomplished by getting the value of a feature map with a determined size
and stride. This study used Max pooling, which only regards the highest value in the feature map.
2.3.2. Identification layer
The second layer of CNN is an identification layer composed of several layers. Each layer is formed
of fully connected neurons with other layers, known as multi-layer perceptron. Meanwhile, the learning
process used some methods such as Backpropagation [28]. This layer handles the dropout process to
overcome overfitting in training, which can cause a reduction [31]. Dropout works by temporarily removing
a neuron in the form of hidden layers, input layers, or output layers that are in the network. The activation
function, usually using Softmax that convert the output into a probability for each class, as shown in (6).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
EEG signals of post-stroke patients can be recognized by observing wave density or rhythm,
amplitude and also differences in the magnitude of channel pair, and the presence of Alpha, Beta, Delta, and
Theta waves. Therefore, learning features used Alpha, Beta, Delta, Teta wave, and amplitude. The key to the
successful classification of EEG signals is extraction into frequency components. Therefore, Wavelet
performance needs to be tested first.
3.1. Wavelet extraction
Wavelet extraction using Symlet2 at 0.5-32 Hz is illustrated in Figure 5. The blue line is the original
signal, and the orange line is the result of a signal that has performed wavelet extraction. It can be seen that a
low wave signal is obtained by decomposing to eliminate noise in the EEG signal via wavelet extraction.

3.2. Compared between optimization model
The classification that is performed using deep learning with the CNN model needs configuration to
obtain high accuracy. In this study, using VGG19 architecture as a learning process. The architecture has 16
convolution layers and five pooling layers. A suitable configuration is required to update the weights during
the training so that they get maximum results. The weight correction can be achieved with various
optimizers. Some of them are adaptive moment estimation (Adam) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
This research optimizes the learning rate of 0.01 and 500 epochs. Accuracy and Loss value each optimizer
are shown in Figure 6, Figure 7, and Table 2. The Adam model (orange color) was more stable than the SGD
model (red color) for new data (valid) in the small epoch. But SGD has higher accuracy compared to Adam.
Because SGD still changes the value of accuracy to find the best value compared to Adam [32].
The convergence of the Adam model to SGD is seen in Loss in Figure 7, so both values are consistent.
Table 2 shows the optimization of SGD is better than Adam, although the loss value is higher. But it
is not significant.

Figure 6. Accuracy of Adam and SGD model

Figure 7. Loss of Adam and SGD model
Besides, to accuracy, testing is performed on computational time in learning. This study carried out
learning in 500 epochs with GPU Nvidia Geforce GTX 1050 4GB. A comparison of computing time between
SGD and Adam models is shown in Table 2. The absence of Beta or amplitude waves, even though they
provide low accuracy, are obtained with a shorter time. Based on Table 1, the number of amplitude points
and Beta waves is the same, which gives the corresponding computational time reduction as Table 2.

3.3. Performance of amplitude and Beta wave
The experiment showed that involve amplitude as a learning feature gave more accurate for both
models, as shown in Table 2. From Figure 8, it can be seen that the accuracy of SGD is also higher than
Adam. And Adam model is more stable too than SGD for configurations without amplitude. CNN works
based on the convolution of time series data with the kernel without affording a direct connection between
sequential data. Therefore, the use of wave features and amplitude still provides higher accuracy.
This experiment is consistent with previous research [8].

Figure 8. Accuracy of Adam and SGD without amplitude

Although the presence of low-frequency wave dominance characterizes strokes, Beta waves also
contribute to MI in addition to Mu waves [26]. Therefore its appearance is also significant for increasing
accuracy. The result showed that the accuracy of the SGD model is higher too than the Adam, without
the presence of Beta waves model, as shown in Figure 9.

CONCLUSION
This study identified two levels of stroke from NIHSS using wavelet and CNN with training data
accuracy of 100% and non-training data at 90%. The essential thing in identification is the proper
configuration of input features according to the identified variable, which is stroke. Using low waves (Delta
and Theta), Alpha, motor imagery (Beta and Mu), and amplitude are significant in the classification of
“minor strokes” to “no strokes”, thus providing good accuracy. Identification using CNN also needs to pay
attention to optimization models that provide high correctness and stability. Sometimes, both of them are
contradictive, so accuracy considerations are preferred. The SGD model is more oscillating at the beginning
of the epoch but provided better accuracy than the Adam model.
In the future, we need to find the configuration of the channel. Appropriate channel processing can
increase accuracy and reduce computing time that is more realistic to implement. Also worth noting
is the setting and sequence of features that provide high accuracy and relatively low computing time.
