ABSTRACT
The availability of EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) devices, which are also available in
everyday applications, has widened the application environment. Many manufacturers have marketed their
own mobile device, which will become virtually accessible to everyone in the near future, opening up new
perspectives in the modern world of human-machine interaction. One of its potential areas is to broaden
the communication capabilities of people with physical disabilities, providing them with data inputs that
they had previously not been able to. Such a feature is a keyboardless text input. In Hungary, in case of
online shopping, the receipt of a train ticket through the MÁV ticket sales machines is also possible to be
received by entering the customer code by typing numbers on a touch screen. However, due to disability,
physical injury or other reasons, there are cases where the user is unable to use hands, therefore this
possibility is virtually impossible to access for them. This omission may, in our opinion, be eliminated by
alternative identification methods. The purpose of this research is to assess the feasibility of entering
characters using EEG based BCI techniques on those machines. The research consists of two parts. In the
first part, the technical parameters of railway ticket vending machines were surveyed to determine whether
or not they provide an opportunity to connect external devices and provide backgrounds for software
communication with BCI. The second part of the research is a questionnaire research. We visited
institutions that care for people with reduced mobility and asked them to fill out our questionnaire with
their patients to assess the need for a possible BCI tool on rail ticket vending machines. We have also
prepared a second questionnaire to measure the attitude of healthy individuals to the use of this device.

Brain-computer interface-based feasibility of entering customer code on ticket vending …

INTRODUCTION
The concept of a smart city means something different for everyone. There is one meaning
for an architect, another for a doctor, something else for an entrepreneur. But in the same
way, it means something to a child, a different thing to an adult, a healthy person, and a sick
person. If you search the web, you will find countless different definitions. Like many
decades ago, when the notion of smart cities was only utopian in the public consciousness,
today everyone is trying to describe his own point of view in some way. Everyone agrees
that, in the case of smart cities, all forms of transport have an infinite amount of potential to
exploit. Public transport, including rail transport, plays a key role, as it is one of the most
economical and environmentally friendly forms of transport for everyone. Of course, this
efficiency can be further enhanced with the introduction of new services and the further
development of the existing ones.
This research is concerned with the expansion and possible facilitation of an essential
component of rail passenger transport, the purchase of electronic train tickets. It is trying to
find out whether technical and social judgment can be implemented in the near future on rail
ticket vending machines by entering the customer code using Brain Computer Interface
(BCI). This technique would not only be a new option in the ticketing process on vending
machines, but it could also provide assistance to people with reduced mobility who are
unable to use them due to their illness or disability.

BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACE
The Brain Computer Interface is a computer communication device that provides a direct,
non-muscular communication channel between an individual and the computer. To achieve
communication, brainwaves are required. This can be achieved without inserting electrodes
(MEG, PET, fMRI and optical imaging) and electrodes (EEG), which can be invasive and
non-invasive. At the moment, EEG is the only technology that has short time constraints and
can be implemented with relatively simple and inexpensive equipment. The use of currently
available techniques only provides some indirect way of text input (selective attention, motor
imagery) [1-8].
Three key factors have been taken into account when designing research goals:
1.) It is important that the ticket vending machines are constituting a compact unit, they are
not equipped with external USB ports. In these vendors, communication between the BCI
device and the machine must be realized through existing external ports. The two most
popular BCI devices currently available are Bluetooth or USB port support, but Bluetooth
connectivity can also be achieved via USB dongle [9-13].
2.) Society generally does not react with immediate acceptance to technological innovations,
following Rogers’ innovation curve [14]. How much time is needed for the majority to
accept a new innovation product depends on a number of circumstances [15].
3.) Based on the data of the Hungarian census of 2011, the number of physically disabled
persons in Hungary is 232 206. This is 2,34 % of the total Hungarian population, and
almost half of all the disabled, that is 47 %. 39,87 % of people with disabilities have said
that their disability is disturbing in traffic [16].
During the research we examined the following three questions:
1.) Are today’s available ticket vending machines able to connect a BCI device to them?
2.) Is such a technical innovation acceptable to users?
3.) Does such a device make it easier for handicapped or disabled people to buy tickets for
rail travel?

RESEARCH METHODS
The technical data of railway ticket vending machines was obtained from the data sheets
provided by 3 different vending machines. In the second part of the research, we investigated
the second and third research domains by anonymous online questionnaire research. We have
treated the responses of physically disabled people separately.

RESEARCH RESULTS
It is true that the Neurosky EEG helmet realizes Bluetooth communication [17], but it does
not necessarily require a built-in Bluetooth adapter, even with a Bluetooth dongle that can be
connected via a USB port. Based on this, the minimum connection condition is the USB port.
Emotiv’s products supports Bluetooth and USB communication [18].
For the application of a BCI device that can be used on railway ticket vending machines
without an external USB port, it is needed to find a solution for communicating with the
available input ports. Both manual and automatic bank card readers, with which MÁV’s
vending machines are also equipped [15], support the ISO7816 standard [19-22]. This means
they can read IC cards. The solution requires the creation of a device that creates a
connection between the BCI device and the card reader. The ticket machine must also have a
software that can read data received from the card reader and transmit it to the software
written on the BCI. To do this, the correct data transfer rate must be ensured. Emotiv headset
sampling rate is 2 048 bit/second [18], Neurosky headset is 6 144 bit/second [17]. Between
the reader and the card the initial speed is 9 600 bit/second [23]. This is sufficient to transfer
signals from the device.
Another important aspect was which operation system the BCI software is running on. There
are officially available text input softwares, and two of them, BCI2000 and OpenVibe are the
most common [24-26]. However, as this area is not fully explored yet, it is constantly under
development and research. In addition, firms distributing headsets also provide their products
with the so-called SDK (Software Development Kit) for such programming languages that
can be used to write application programs on multiple operating systems. Microsoft Windows
is supported for each of the devices studied [12, 17, 18].
Three of the examined railway ticket dispensers and their important parameters for research
are presented in Table 1. Table 1 shows that all machines have a USB port and operate on a
Linux or Windows operation system. This is in line with our expectations and we can
conclude from this point that the use of the BCI tool can be used to enter the customer code
on the train ticket vending machines.
We tried to get information about MÁV’s rail ticket vending machines, but we only found out
that they were based on industrial PC. Based on videos found on YouTube, among which
there are some showing that the automated operating system sends an error message to the
user, the operation system running on them is Microsoft Windows.

Summarizing the results, we can conclude that the available train ticket vending machines
support the BCI tools when the software is installed.

CAN SUCH TECHNICAL INNOVATIONS BE ACCEPTABLE TO USERS?
We tried to answer the question using an anonymous questionnaire survey online, intended to
be a preliminary survey, and it can be used for a detailed, comprehensive research later on.
As we have already mentioned when formulating the goals, the wide differentiation of
innovation depends on a number of parameters, along the Rogers curve, happening in stages:
cognition, interest, evaluation, testing, and acceptance.
The participants in the process, based on the dynamics of innovation, are divided into five
groups according to Rogers [14]:
1.) innovators 2,5 %,
2.) early adopters 13,5 %,
3.) early majority 34 %,
4.) late majority 34 %,
5.) laggards 16 %.
The Rogers curve is shown in Figure 1.
With the questions in the questionnaire, we wanted to find out the general information about
what they think influences the group of individuals they belong to: gender, education, work,
computer skills, internet habits, electronic ticket buying, if they are aware that railway ticket
vending machines exist in Hungary.

Figure 1. Innovation adoption curve [27].

In addition, we have been looking for the extent to which they show interest in the use of the
ticketing automats with the BCI tool, and how often they would use it.
The questionnaire was filled out by a total of 166 persons, of whom 74 were physically
disabled or disadvantaged, and 92 were physically not disabled/disadvantaged.
Since our intention was to pay special attention to the responses of physically
disabled/disadvantaged respondents, and the ratio did not either correspond to the distribution
of population in Hungary, the analysis was carried out separately for the two groups.
Therefore, the results of the non-disabled/disadvantaged group and the results of the
physically disabled/disadvantaged group will be presented separately.
The gender distribution of non-disabled/disadvantaged groups is 31 women and 61 men, Table 2.

Filling out the questionnaire was voluntary, via a web interface, which meant that we could
not influence gender. It appears from the tables that the majority of men (66,30 %) are in the
non-disabled/disadvantaged group, while in the disabled / disadvantaged group women are, in
similar proportions (62,16 %).
In the non-disabled/disadvantaged group, the majority of respondents are under the age of 45
(84,78 %), while the majority of applicants in the disabled / disadvantaged group belong to
the age group above 44 (70,27 %).
The questionnaire contained two questions which we used to divide the respondents into
three groups. In the first group, following Rogers’ division, there were the innovators, early
adopters and early majority, the second group was the late majority, while the third group
was the laggards and those who are not willing to accept the technology at the moment.
The first group represents those individuals who would use the device on a regular basis to
respond to them and would clearly buy it if it was to match the price of a mid-range keyboard.
In the second group, we classified those individuals who would try the device and buy it, or
may be uncertain whether they would buy the device if its price would match the price of a
mid-range keyboard. In the third group, we grouped individuals who would not try and would
not use the device either.
All three groups were based on two replies, the aim of which was to filter out the respondents
who gave conflicting answers. After the discontinuation of the controversial questionnaires,
we received a total of 61 evaluable questionnaires from the non-disabled / disadvantaged
group and 46 questionnaires from the disabled / disadvantaged group.
The gender ratio corresponds to the aggregate ratio in all divisions, so we did not make a
separate statement for this.
The aggregate percentage distribution of results is shown in Table 4.
Analyzing the results, it can be stated that 55,74 % of the non-disabled / disadvantaged
respondents are in the first group. This is only 5,74 % higher than the rate set by Rogers. In the
case of disabled/disadvantaged, it is 43,48 %, which is only 6,52 % lower than that of Rogers.

Brain-computer interface-based feasibility of entering customer code on ticket vending …

In the second group, which includes the late majority by Rogers, the proportion of nondisabled/disadvantaged respondents is 11,05 % lower than that of Rogers and 7,3 % higher in
the disabled/disadvantaged group. It is a group of two sub-groups and, if we examine it, the
difference on one side in both cases is almost exactly reflected in the difference on the other
side. In the case of non-disabled/disadvantaged persons it is –5,31 % and 0,78 % for the
disabled/disadvantaged group.
The third group is the group of laggards. The proportion of non-disabled/disadvantaged
respondents in this group is 21,31 %. The difference of –5,31 % in the second group appears
visibly here, as they are also borderline categories. The proportion of disabled/disadvantaged
respondents is only 0,78 % different from Rogers, which is a negligible difference.
With this in mind, we have looked at the responses that determine the limitations and we
have come to the conclusion that the aforementioned deviations result from these, and that by
replicating the research on a larger population, these responses have to be defined in more
details and additional opportunities for respondents.
PARAMETERS DEFINING THE GROUPS
As the next step, we determined the factors that are most characteristic of each group. The
results were determined according to Table 4. Defining factors within the group were those
with the highest number of responses in the given group.
RESULTS OF NON-DISABLED/DISADVANTAGED RESPONDENTS
The first group is characterized by 18-44 year-olds with a high school education at least, and
their job also requires at least high school education. They have at least basic IT knowledge,
place of living is not a factor. In this group, there are individuals who are familiar with, used,
and also do not use the E-ticket service and rail ticket vending machines.
The second group is characterized by 45-54 year-olds, there are no one without profession
and none are post-graduates, and their occupation is characterized by being machine builders,
operators and drivers as well as agriculture and forestry occupations. They have mid-level IT
skills. Following the first group, this group has the majority of people living in the capital
city. One third of the regular users of ticketing machines are in this group.
The third group contains the majority of people over the age of 54. This group includes noneducated people with primary education, non-skilled workforce and most of the people who
do not have the proper IT background knowledge to use the computer on their own. The same
number of people lives in county capitals as in the first group, and one third of them uses rail
ticket vending machines.
The resulting curve is shown in Figure 2.
RESULTS OF DISABLED/DISADVANTAGED RESPONDENTS
The first group includes 25-44 year-olds and those above 54, college, university and
postgraduate qualifications, and most of the people requiring higher education. There is the
same number of non-qualified workplaces in this group as in the second (40%). The group is
characterized by medium-level IT skills and IT knowledge. This group contains the majority
of people living in Budapest, in other cities and in the villages. This group has the most
individuals who have not used it yet, have used it or regularly use the E-ticket service. In this
group there are the most individuals who know the existence of railway ticket vending
machines but have not used them yet.

Figure 2. Distribution according to the groups.

The second group is between 18-24 and 35-54 years of age, having high school, grammar
school or lower education. The most typical occupations of the group are: economists,
administrative workers, interest representation leaders, legislators, operators, assemblers,
drivers, office and business (customer relationship) professions, trade and service occupations
and armed services. It is characterized by basic, intermediate and advanced IT skills. This
group contains most individuals living in county capital cities. In this group, there are the
most people who know about the E-ticket service, but have not used it, have used it, as well
as those who have not used a train ticket vending machine yet.
The third group is characterized by a low percentage in all areas. Its members are older than
45, and no factor is representative in this group.

WOULD SUCH A DEVICE MAKE IT EASIER FOR DISADVANTAGED
PERSONS/PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES TO PURCHASE RAIL
TICKETS?
In this issue only the responses of people with reduced mobility/disabilities have been
analysed.
There was only one person who did not use the Internet. 27,03 % lives in Budapest, 25,68 %
in county capitals, 32,43 % in towns and 14,86 % in municipalities or villages. 88,33 %
spends several hours a day on the Internet. 45,95 % of them says that rail ticket purchases are
made easier by E-ticket service, 9,46 % says there is no difference between them and
traditional ticket purchases and only 1,35 % thinks it makes it more difficult. Regardless of
the place of residence, the majority, who believes that E-ticket services make purchases
easier, prevails everywhere. 14,86 % does not agree that rail ticket vending machines make it
easier for them to buy tickets. 82,43 % of them agrees, the remaining 2,70 % did not give a
sensible answer (they cannot use or do not use ticket vending machines).
The answer to the question if they had the opportunity to use a tool to enter the code into the
ticket vending machine without typing, would they try/use it, is that 14,86 % would not try it,
52,70 % would try it, but not use it regularly, 32,43 % would use it regularly.
The same device would be bought by 58,11 % if it existed and would not cost more than a
mid-size keyboard (of which 22,97 % would purchase it unconditionally). 29,73 % does not
need it, 9,46 % thinks it is expensive and would not buy it. The remaining 2,70 % is uncertain,
they cannot imagine using it.

D. Simonyi and T. Kovács

By reviewing the responses, we can conclude that the responding disabled/disadvantaged
population is open to using such a tool and sees potential. The answer to this question is yes,
according to those surveyed; such a device would facilitate the purchase of rail tickets for
people with mobility impairment.
