Abstract
Background
Researchers in environmental psychology have consistently shown the restorative
potential of natural – over urban - settings using video/photographic experiments
in laboratory settings applying subjectively rated scales. But few studies have
employed objective indicators of emotional response. This study investigates the
use of electroencephalography (EEG) as a method to understand how the brain
engages with natural versus (vs) urban settings – in tandem with subjective
preferences.
Methods
Using Emotiv EPOC, a commercial and low-cost EEG recorder, participants
(n=20) viewed a series of urban vs landscape scenes with proven reliability in
restorative environments research. The equipment provided continuous recordings
from 5 channels, labelled Excitement; Frustration; Engagement; Long Term (LT)
Excitement (or arousal) and Meditation. Participants also rated the image set
subjectively for valence (pleasure-displeasure), arousal (calm-excitement),
attractiveness and willingness to visit the scene.
Results
Landscape scenes were consistently rated more positively on the preference scales
(i.e. attractiveness, willingness to visit and valance ratings) (p<0001). Data
reduction of the EEG output revealed two components: Arousal which correlated
with urban scenes and Interest which correlated with landscape scenes (p<0.01).
Latent class analysis was carried out to explore clusters – or sub groups – in the
data and to identify significant emotional discriminators between the two sets of
images. A two-cluster model produced the best fit, with image scene, and three of
the EEG emotional parameters (i.e. excitement, LT excitement, and meditation)
significantly discriminating between the two clusters (p<0.05). Landscape scenes
were associated with greater levels of meditation and lower arousal (i.e.
excitement) and the urban scenes with higher arousal.
Conclusion
It has been shown that EEG data in an experimental setting is sensitive to
detecting emotional change from viewing different environmental settings,
furthering the evidence base for a restorative effect of natural settings. We have
established a novel method for measuring environment-mind interactions – a tool
we have subsequently developed to establish the mood-enhancing benefits of
walking in urban green space [1].

BACKGROUND
Laboratory studies comparing photo sets and/or videos of urban versus (vs)
natural scenes have proved robust in detecting the perceived restorativeness of
natural settings, reviewed in [2]. It is posited that the psychological benefit of
natural settings operates via attention restoration mechanisms [3]. Soft fascination
(intriguing environmental stimuli) promotes involuntary attention, enabling
cognitive recovery from fatigue and is typically present in natural settings. By
contrast, hard fascination (demanding stimulation) grabs attention dramatically
increasing cognitive load and is typically present in urban settings. Consistently,
over 20 years, results have shown increased positive affect, reduced arousal, and
stress and fatigue recovery from viewing natural settings, using a range of
outcome measures that include attention tests and self-report psychological scales.
However, only a handful of studies have employed EEG identifying tranquility as
an outcome of viewing natural settings [4], significantly higher alpha [5] and
greater relaxation [6]. Recently Korean researchers utilized functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate brain activation patterns in 30
participants viewing nature vs urban scenes [7]. The urban scenes showed
enhanced activity in the amygdala, which is linked to impulsivity, anxiety and
increased stress. By contrast, the natural scenes promoted activity in the anterior
cingulate and the insula – where increased activity is associated with heightened
empathy and altruistic behavior. Consistency in type of scene explored in
laboratory experiments has been very variable; it’s reported that only 35% of all
experimental studies have contrasted urban vs natural scenes [2] and the
formatting of image sets - using consistent landscape types – and the proportion of
natural:built scene has only recently been systematically refined [8].

AIMS
Our study aimed to explore if electroencephalography (EEG) technology could,
firstly, detect emotional change to the experience of landscape vs urban scenes
and, secondly, further build the evidence base for restorative effect of natural
environments. Based on earlier research we posited that natural scenes will be
rated more positively than urban scenes (hypothesis 1). We further posited that
natural scenes will be associated with EEG output indicating restorative health
effects (i.e. increased meditation and lower arousal parameters) as compared to
urban scenes (hypothesis 2).

The participants were then asked to watch a series of 15 images, appearing for 20
seconds after a 20 second interval, while their emotional response to the stimuli
was captured by their EEG. Afterwards, participants were asked to review the 15
slides and rate them on four dimensions (see below) and conducted three practice
trials, prior to a random presentation of the full photo set. Each slide was
presented for 20 seconds. Subjective responses were provided on a paper
questionnaire; the EEG output was directly recorded by the computer. Finally,
participants filled a debrief questionnaire providing demographic data.
Outcome measures
(1) Subjective preferences:
We selected 4 subjective questions to capture emotional and behavioural
responses to scene replicating [8]. These rated (1) the aesthetic quality of the
scene (“How attractive do you find this scene?”) and (2) potential behaviour
(“How willing would you be to visit this scene?”), with both items ranked from
Not at all (1) to Extremely (10). The two remaining items were designed to tap
into two dimensions of core affect i.e. valence (i.e. pleasure-displeasure) and
arousal [9]: “How does this photo make you feel?” with two response scales,
Very Sad (1) to Very Happy (10) (i.e. valence), and Calm (1) to Excited (10) (i.e.
arousal).
(2) EEG outcome measures.
We used an Emotiv EPOC EEG headset for our study [1] [10] [11] which also
provides software to analyse raw EEG data (emotiv.com). In brief, the headset
captures 12 channels of EEG from frontal (AF3, AF4, F3, F4, F7, F8), frontocentral (FC5, FC6), occipital (O1, O2), parietal (P8) and temporal sites (T7, T8)
capturing four main independent bands: Delta (0.5-4Hz) - indicating deep sleep,
restfulness, and conversely excitement or agitation when delta waves are
suppressed; Theta (4-8Hz) - indicating deep meditative states, daydreaming and
automatic tasks; Alpha (8-15Hz) - indicating relaxed alertness, restful and
meditative states; Beta (15-30Hz) - indicating wakefulness, alertness, mental
engagement and conscious processing of information. Our study used “Affectiv
Suite” emotion-detection software that interprets the EEG oscillations of the
various bands into 5 emotional parameters: excitement (i.e. arousal of short
duration – several seconds), Long-Term (LT) excitement (i.e. arousal of longer
duration – several minutes), frustration (disappointment or cognitive load),
engagement (i.e alertness), and meditation. For a full summary of the device and
software, together with a review of studies validating the equipment, see Aspinall
et al, 2013.

The data reported is for the reduced photo set applied in the exploratory analysis
(reported below).
2. The EEG data
(a) Data reduction
To simplify the photographic analysis we created a binary variable categorizing
the urban and landscape slides into two groups, using a set of 6 slides,
significantly different in both their content and preference ratings (3 urban vs 3
landscape) (as reported in Table 1 and illustrated in Fig 1).
To simplify the EEG data we carried out a factor analysis (oblique rotation) which
showed the 5 emotional channels belong to two basic groups. One group consists
of excitement (short term and LT) with meditation as a correlated opposite
(negative loading on same factor) which we labeled Arousal; the other group
consists of engagement with frustration as a correlated opposite (negative loading
again) which we labeled Interest.
(b) Exploring relationships between the images and the EEG data
Bi-variate correlations showed statistically significant and strong correlations
between the Arousal factor and the urban images and between the Interest factor
and the landscape scenes (at p<0.01). A surprising finding was the correlation
between engagement and frustration in the Interest factor; this is contrary to

Engaging the brain

99

restorative theory which posits that engagement (in the form of fascination) with
natural scenes demands our attention effortlessly (i.e. without frustration). A
further examination of the bivariate correlations showed frustration was the only
variable to significantly correlate with all other emotional parameters – suggesting
it therefore lacks uniqueness and shares similar attributes to the other emotional
parameters. Frustration is also an unusual emotional term to use while looking at
a landscape scene with no prescribed visual problem to solve. We therefore chose
to run the subsequent analysis with frustration removed from the data.
(c) Latent Class Analysis (LCA)
Following methods outlined in [12] latent class analysis (LCA) was carried out
using version 4.0 of Latent Gold [13]. This is a form of regression analysis which
can handle non-parametric data and which identifies clusters or sub-groups (latent
classes) in a data set. In an exploratory analysis, such as this, with no precedents
on which to anticipate the cluster number, we estimated four latent class models,
(from 1 to 4 clusters) and entered the binary image variable, and the average
responses of each of the 4 four emotional parameters to each image (i.e.
excitement, LT excitement, meditation, and engagement). We used the criterion
of the minimum Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to determine cluster
number [14]; the BIC values for the first 1 to 4 clusters were 956, 914, 928 945
respectively indicating a 2 cluster solution the best fit to the data.

(d) Latent Class profiles
Table 2 below shows the significance of each variable in its capacity to
discriminate between the 2 clusters. The R squared value indicates how much of a
variable is explained by the cluster model. The p values show that image
(landscape vs urban), excitement (short term and LT) and meditation are all
significant discriminators between the two clusters. Engagement is not a
significant discriminator.

The cluster profile is shown in Table 3. The table presents mean item-response
probabilities for the photoset and each of EEG emotional parameters. These

indicate the probability of reporting a value above the median value within a
class. Table 3 shows that the clusters are of approximately the same size i.e. 56%
of participant cases are in cluster 1; 44% in cluster 2. The profile shows the
landscape images predominantly appear in Cluster 1 (69%) whereas the urban
images predominate in cluster 2 (58%).
Exploring the means, Cluster 1
(landscape) is associated with lower excitement (short term and LT), higher
engagement and increased meditation; Cluster 2 (urban) with higher excitement
(short term and LT), lower meditation and lower engagement. This pattern is
clearly shown in Fig 2 below, illustrating the cluster profile for the landscape
(cluster 1) and urban (cluster 2) images.

DISCUSSION
The subjective data indicates that natural scenes are rated more positively than
urban scenes (as predicted by hypothesis 1), replicating findings by others on the
same image set [8]. Our EEG analysis indicates that meditation and excitement (a
factor group we have interpreted as arousal) can significantly predict image scene
with lower arousal and higher levels of meditation associated with the landscape
scenes (as predicted by hypothesis 2). This confirms restorative theory indicating
a positive psychological effect of natural scenes.
Our data flags some interesting issues around the interpretation of frustration and
engagement. Firstly, considering engagement; in the current study we found
natural scenes – viewed in a laboratory setting - promoted stronger engagement;
whereas using mobile EEG in our urban walking study [12] we found evidence of
lower engagement in a green space setting. In our earlier paper we associated
engagement with directed attention (i.e. the urban scene dramatically demanded
greater cognitive attention to cross roads/negotiate traffic etc.). We suggest,
firstly, the context of the study might explain this differing outcome i.e. sitting in
a safe (rather dull) laboratory setting promoted higher levels of engagement with

102

Jenny J. Roe et al.

the landscape scenes as opposed to the ‘grey’ urban images. Secondly, given the
foreground features in the landscape slides (see Fig 1), this might have engaged
greater levels of curiosity, while, the ‘urban’ images did not include dynamic
aspects, such as pedestrian and vehicular traffic, urban sounds and other sensory
information that are usually anticipated in urban environments. We conclude the
context of the study and content of the images explains the higher levels of
engagement with landscape settings in this experimental study.
Considering frustration, we found this negatively correlated with engagement (i.e.
higher levels of engagement were associated with higher levels of frustration contrary to a restorative effect of natural settings), and subsequently removed it
from the data analysis. The software developer, Emotiv, confirms frustration is a
complex parameter and highly sensitive to the context in which it is measured.
For instance, in a gaming context, it is not unusual for engagement to correlate
with frustration in a situation where players are subjected to levels of increasing
difficulty and frequently have their gameplay sabotaged. EPOC has suggested an
alternative name for this state in this context might be Inherent Stress, and
Disappointment. In respect to this study, disappointment may also apply i.e. there
was simply insufficient interest in a ‘grey’ urban scene to promote fascination.
In summary, we have demonstrated that a commercial and low-cost EEG
technology, such as Emotiv EPOC, is sensitive to detecting emotional change to
different environmental settings, mirroring subjective preferences, and consistent
with restorative theory. In this experiment, we have used the emotions detections
from a “black-box” software kit, but demonstrated these measures are consistent
with self-reported measures [15] and afford further research. We have
subsequently developed mobile EEG to establish the mood-enhancing benefits of
walking in urban green space [1]. The data shown here confirms the findings of
our earlier paper indicating changes in EEG emotive channels as people move
from urban to landscape environments.
