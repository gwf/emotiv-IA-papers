Affective Level Design for a Role-Playing Videogame Evaluated
by a Brain-Computer Interface and Machine Learning Methods
Fabrizio Balducci · Costantino Grana · Rita Cucchiara

Received: date / Accepted: date

Abstract Game science has become a research field
which attracts industry attention due to a worldwide
rich sell-market. In order to understand the player experience, concepts like Flow or Boredom mental states
require formalization and empirical investigation, taking advantage of the objective data that psychophysiological methods like electroencephalography (EEG) can
provide. This work studies the affective ludology and
shows two different game levels for Neverwinter Nights
2 developed with the aim to manipulate emotions; two
sets of affective design guidelines are presented, with
a rigorous formalization that considers the characteristics of Role-Playing genre and its specific gameplay.
An empirical investigation with a brain-computer interface headset has been conducted: by extracting numerical data features, machine learning techniques classify the different activities of the gaming sessions (task
and events) to verify if their design differentiation coincides with the affective one. The observed results, also
supported by subjective questionnaires data, confirm
the goodness of the proposed guidelines suggesting that
this evaluation methodology could be extended to other
evaluation tasks.

1 Introduction
The concept of playing is strictly linked to our lives,
one of the first activities that a human experiences by
discovering his surrounding world: a successful method
to learn rules or how to safely execute a task is in fact
“gamify”, i.e. to see them like a gaming activity from
which gaining experience for future goals [1]; this is
the basis of gamification and serious gaming theories
which try to introduce playful aspects, often borrowed
by videogame creators, in all daily interactive activities.
Lindley [2] provides a commonly accepted definition
of game as “a goal-directed and competitive activity
conducted within a framework of agreed rules”. Given
this definition, it is often said that “to play” involves
learning the internal rules of a game, i.e. the set of
mechanics that characterize its interactive dynamics
and denote each game genre (known as “gameplay”).
Frasca [3], referring to Csı́kszentmihályi’s studies [4], defines the modern concept of ludology as the
“science of the game” which uses research methods
and theories from a wide range of scientific communities (such as Human-Computer Interaction and psychophysiology) with the aim to improve the methodologies to study both players and (video)games, understanding the design of an optimal player experience.
In over 30 years videogame platforms evolved, moving from large old cabinets to smart-watches that easily
permit to play in mobility, allowing learning [5], large
data exploration [6] or archaeological visits [7]. The academic world also considers videogaming as a multidisciplinary research [8] and teaching field [9].
Nowadays the videogame represents a medium that
requests high skilled workers [10] and budgets that can
rival with cinema, music, comics and literature industry. Videogames production is a large business [11] esti-

2

mated in 93$ billion in 2013 [12]. The development cost
of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was between 40$ million - 50$ million, with a marketing and release budget
of $200 million [13]. Other aspects that highlight the
market widening are the intersection between toys and
games [14], the phenomenon of in-game advertising [15]
and the importance of press and user critics [16].
The costs for a triple A title oblige editors to
accept fewer risks, looking for a formula that will
ensure great games for everyone, omitting that each
person is different due to factors like age, education,
country and personal history. While Paavilainen [17]
and Korhonen et al. [18] propose and review many
evaluation heuristics, it becomes crucial to define and
manipulate complex concepts like Fun with innovative
methods that consider player’s feelings and preferences
by retrieving objective and scientifically evaluable data.
This paper describes how to apply affective level
design and the manipulation of emotions in digital
Role-Playing Games by designing activities in a game
level (also known as “scenario”); moreover a novel
evaluation methodology is proposed, to extract and
analyze objective data from affective states and use
them to uniquely connote the activities and the game
level areas formally developed.
Section 2 presents experimental studies about gaming while Section 3 introduces terms commonly used
in videogames design; a brief introduction to emotion analysis is provided in Section 4. Section 5 proposes formal design guidelines and Section 6 illustrates their practical application into a commercial
RPG videogame. Section 7 briefly illustrates the technical tools used while Section 8 describes the experimental setup. Results from experimentation and their
evaluation are in Section 9 while Section 10 focuses on
questionnaires data. Finally, conclusions are drawn in
Section 11, along with suggestions for future work.

The manifestation of mental states in a person can be
measured: studies from Mandryk et al. [19] have successfully demonstrated how psychophysiological techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) evidence
human emotions and cognitive activity during gaming.
Affective computing, as a field of study, was captured
by Rosalind Picard [20] while Nacke [21] introduces the
concept of affective ludology referring to the investigations of affective player-game interaction to understand emotional and cognitive experiences: it must inquire about cognition, emotions, and goal-oriented behavior from a scientific perspective and establish rigor-

Fabrizio Balducci et al.

ous methodologies (e.g. psychological player testing or
physiological response analysis of players).
Noah et al. [22] measure brain activity with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a clone of Dance
Dance Revolution videogame to study how different sensory inputs influence the motor output, while
Groenegress et al. [23] introduce a system for realtime physiological analysis and metaphorical visualization within a virtual environment, considering heart
rate, respiration and galvanic skin responses. Rawn and
Brodbeck [24] use questionnaires and Doom 3 to inquire about violence and aggressive interactions while
Jacopin [25] analyzes internal data from F.E.A.R., KillZone 3 and Transformers 3 to develop intelligent NPC;
in Gilleade et al. [26] the affective state is used to manipulate the game session.
A Brain-Computer Interface is a system that measures brain electrical activity allowing to retrieve information about feelings and emotions. In the field of
computer science, the BCI has been used with various
purposes like measure mnemonic and cognitive efforts
(Grimes et al. [27]) while Vachiratamporn et al. [28]
measure player experience with EEG and heartbeat signals, using a survival horror videogame as experimental
environment. Lotte [29] considers BCI as an additional
control channel to interact with virtual environments,
but its results underline some limits according to which
20% of players cannot use it as a gaming device; adaptive virtual environment and emotion assessment methods are also in [30] while Coulton et al. [31] successfully
use EEG headset with mobile games.
Burke et al. [32] introduce game design guidelines for stroke rehabilitation using serious games and
Kang et al. [33] create a 3D sensory gate-ball game
system to improve both physical and mental health of
the aged people. Nacke et al. [34, 21] evaluate game levels for the first-person shooter Half-Life using a BCI
while [35] consider to evaluate videogames dealing with
game activities like events (an automatically activated
accident) and tasks (a voluntary performed act).
Another way to employ an EEG headset is like a
real-time input device: Vourvopoulos et al. [36] propose
a reconstruction of the ancient Rome that can be
explored using brainwaves and also Liarokapis et al. [37]
create a Lego NTX robot remotely controlled by them;
in both studies there is a comparison between the
headsets produced by Emotiv and Neurosky. Finally
Schwarz et al. [38] introduce a Pong clone controlled by
two Emotiv headset together and Chumerin et al. [39]
propose an application where an avatar navigates The
Maze guided by brainwaves.

gameplay is characterized.

3 Gameplay and Genres
The design of a videogame depends on the gameplay
and the genre: the former defines how narrative and
ludic elements guarantee that players don’t quit the
game [40], while the latter exposes design solutions
and constant features coming from previous products
widely accepted by the sell-market; usually a gamer
refers to a videogame citing its genre or by a direct
comparison stating that game X is like Y (already
known) [41]. Defining a gameplay involves the tacit
knowledge of designers whose target is to maximize the
player experience, i.e. the set of feelings and opinions
that come from an activity which has to capture
player’s senses.
The term “genre” is used to classify and categorize
entities by highlighting their common and uncommon
features, as it happens for books and movies. In the
videogame context it refers to which gameplay a gamer
wants to satisfy his player experience. Machado et
al. [42] develop a player modeling taxonomy with
several game platforms that can be used by researchers,
Lewis et al. [43] propose a taxonomy for game bugs
while Pinelle et al. [44] consider how genres concern
usability and design issues.
Compiling a taxonomy with a clear genres division
involves much subjectivity due to the extreme variety of gameplay: the works of Berens and Howard [45]
and Carlá [46] suggest classifications based on historical period and technology platforms. Khaleghi and Lugmayr [47], and Scavarelli and Arya [12], introduce respectively surveys and a game ethics framework (tested

3

on Fable and Super Mario Bros.) to classify according
to genre, technologies and gameplay features.
Lindley [2] defines a triangular scheme (a version of
which is in Fig. 1) where each vertex denotes the polarization of genres towards the metrics of Simulation,
Ludology and Narratology. Privileging Simulation implies the reconstruction of physical laws and real world
constraints (or particular aspects of them), denoting
a slow gameplay based on parameters tuning and high
longevity; conversely Ludology denotes immediate frantic gameplay with progressive difficulty, in fact this
games belong to the arcade genre which is characterized by few options but low longevity.
Langer et al. [48] propose suspenseful design to inquire narrative and storytelling, while Frasca [49] studies the relationships between ludology and narrative
considering it as an integration for other metrics, in
fact it offers ways to enhance involvement similarly to
non-interactive media. Calleja [50] studies the narrative involvement, introducing a model to understand
the player experiential narrative, while Zagalo and Torres [51] present an emotion module from an authoring
tool of interactive storytelling.
It is noteworthy that in the scheme in Fig. 1,
Role-Playing genre is positioned exactly in the center,
emphasizing the balance of the metrics: in Section 5
and 6 a further analysis of these factors will bring to
the formalization of general design guidelines.

4 Emotions and Affective States
The electric potential generated by a single brain neuron is too weak to be detected by an electroencephalogram, and in fact it is the synchronized activity of millions of neurons having the same spatial orientation
that is considered. For their characteristics, the pyramidal neurons on the cerebral cortex are considered
the largest emitters of EEG signals producing different
brainwaves characterized by their frequency [52]:
– Gamma Waves have the highest frequency range
(30-80 Hz), involved in higher cognitive functioning
like memory and information processing; states of
anxiety and stress presents high levels of this.
– Beta Waves known as “high frequency-low amplitude” waves (13-30 Hz) involves conscious thought,
logical and critical thinking and socialization; their
activity increases with stimulants, like caffeine.
– Alpha Waves associated to calm and meditation
with a regular and synchronized configuration (8-13
Hz); they are also called Berger waves in memory of
the inventor of the EEG in 1929.

Fig. 2 A circumplex model of affect interpretation: Excitement is pleasant and activated so it is located in the upperright quadrant like Engagement. Meditation, pleasant but not
activated, is located in the bottom-right quadrant. Frustration
and Boredom are unpleasant, but the first is activated and so
it is located in the upper-left quadrant while the second is in
the bottom-left.

– Theta Waves involved in daydreaming and REM
sleep phase with a low frequency range (3.5-8 Hz);
they are connected to deep and raw emotions, intuition and creativity with streams of consciousness
near an hypnotic state.
– Delta Waves the slowest recorded brainwaves (under
3.5 Hz) associated with deepest levels of sleep; an
abnormal activity usually denotes brain injuries and
learning problems.
An useful scheme to evaluate basic emotions is the
Circumplex model of affect by Russell et al. [53, 54] (an
interpretation of which is in Fig. 2): it consists of a twodimensional spatial model with a set of human emotions
defined on a circumference, related to the bipolar
metrics of Valence (X axis) and Arousal (Y axis).
Valence is an indicator which describes if an emotion
is pleasant or unpleasant, while Arousal denotes the
intensity (activation or deactivation), i.e. reactivity to
stimuli that influence its detection.
Andreassi [55] defines psychophysiology as the science which inquires relations between the psychological manipulation and the resulting physiological effects, linking physiological measures (EEG) with abstract psychological constructs like Attention and Fun;
the work of Craveirinha and Roque [56] offers a theoretical overview of the nature of play activities, and
studies how certain ludic elements are in relationship
with the emotional spectrum.
In Jennett et al. [57] Flow mood clearly overlaps
with Immersion in the sense of distorting time: introducing the concept of cognitive absorption, Immersion is
proposed as a gradual experience which involves the re-

moval of the external environment (spatial, audio-visual
and temporal) and appears evidently a precursor for the
Flow. Multi-sensory virtual environments to increase
Immersion are also in Chalmers et al. [58].
The terms “affect” and “emotion” are often used interchangeably referring to a short-time emotional peak
while, conversely, a “mood” or “affective state” denotes
a continuous lasting emotional trend which may involve
more emotions influencing the global reactions [49].
This work will focus on the manipulation of emotions
and on the definition of Flow and Boredom states, considering the five emotion detected by the Emotiv EPOC
EEG headset (Excitement, Engagement, Frustration,
Meditation and Long-Term Excitement).
Engagement is associated to participation and attention and its increase denotes challenging tasks and
pleasure to discover new aspects of the game; commonly
it is used as an indicator of Fun. If the aim is to induce
a Flow state, most of the game tasks must increase
this emotion, while the contrary must be true for the
Boredom induction, because it is a deactivated emotion
interpretable as the opposite of Engagement.
Excitement is a positive indicator characterized by
muscle tension and increased sweating and heartbeat:
since evoked by short-time emotional peaks, it is better
to consider it linked to Long-Term Excitement i.e.
a global value which expresses how stable over time
Excitement is. The manipulation of this emotions must
work in the same way as seen for Engagement.
Inducing and analyzing Frustration and Meditation
is difficult due to their high subjectivity and the
negative valence. A meditative activity [59] can take a
long time and a lot of training to be correctly performed
by a motivated subject, also inducing frustration or
boredom in the first attempts.
Frustration might influence other emotions, in fact
different players might perceive the same amount of it
as a challenge or as a reason to quit the game: if the
cause is internal (laziness, lack of confidence) it can be
a motivating force but, if caused by external factors
perceived to be outside individual control (i.e. task too
hard) it can lead to powerlessness and eventually anger
(Dollard et al. [60]).

5 Design for Affective Ludology
A representation of game levels is described in Park and
Park [61] in terms of event/state/action graphs in order to minimize design anomalies while Vanhatupa [62]
presents guidelines for RPG games. Thong [63] investigates effectiveness of role-playing videogames as a learning experience emphasizing storyline and characters;

Horsfall and Oikonomou [64] shows that gamers prefer strong storylines and character development while
also Tychsen et al. [65] find that discovery & immersion are the best motivational features to play them.
When considering role-playing gameplay features, we
will focus on the aspects shown in Lankoski [66]:

5.

strong story plot with moral choices
progression of skills and abilities
presence of allies in a group (the “party”)
interaction based on dialogues (question driven)
a world to explore (dungeons)

The RPG gameplay is less immediate than other
genres because it is based on statistics, skills and object
inventory, with a great importance given to environmental exploration; according to Brown and Cairns [67]
there are three participation phases (Engagement, Engrossment, Total Immersion) in which the concepts of
Immersion and Flow result to be very close.
About the design for Immersion, we consider
Calleja [68] who states that player involvement is a
prerequisite for it: a captivating story plot, for example, will not only influence the sense of narrative involvement but also the affective involvement, impacting
on the quests and goals presented to the gamer (ludic
involvement). Nacke et al. [34] propose formal design
guidelines that separate Immersion and Flow by dividing the concept of environment from that of combat
(which is the focus of FPS gameplay) while Wilcox [69]
considers Immersion linked to the realism (of graphic
and gameplay) reached by modern videogames .
Keeping these facts in mind, for RPG we consider
Immersion as a necessary condition to reach the Flow
state: the importance of the visual assets becomes
evident for us, in fact it can be considered a “theatrical
stage” where characters perform activities. In order to
stress these concepts, the first game level created for
Neverwinter Nights 2 will focus on the Boredom state
while the other will stress the Flow one.

5.1 Boredom game level
Fisher [70] defines the boredom like an unpleasant
affective state with lack of concentration and difficulty
during the execution of a task; Csı́kszentmihályi [71]
furthermore denotes it like a state in which player’s
skills are greater than required (Fig. 3-a).
This game level must be characterized by linearity
and repetitiveness with poor challenge, minimal plotstory and weak visual assets; dialogues will be short
and plain while allies will result unnecessary and weak.
Considering the previous list, the formal design
guidelines are:

Fig. 3 The Flow state: (a) absence of Flow for unskilled
or over-skilled players; (b) Flow with challenge and abilities
constant balancing; (c) different Flow zones for different players.

1. Given n sets of different assets like textures X1 ,
3D models X2 , enemy types X3 , sounds X4 , then
e1 , X
e2 , ..., X
en }, with X
ek ⊂ Xk
a game level L = {X
becomes less interesting if it contains few assets,
ek ∈ L, |X
ek |  |Xk |; the same should
so that ∀X
be for all other structural and visual assets like
animations, visual effects, items, weapons.
2. Assuming a spatial progression point p to indicate
game level progression and given a set E of n types
of enemy e with constant strength smaller than
player strength, then the player challenge function
fch (e, p) for an encounter with enemy type e at
progression point p should remain constant ∀e ∈
E, ∀p.
3. For each progression point p the player should be
constantly rewarded with n items that refresh player
health value ih and its ammunition value ia so that
the full player ammunition supply value A and the
full player health value H are steadily reached.
4. No real main goals G are given so that the victory
condition doesn’t allow any reward to the player.
5. Considering n characters a featuring skills of a
specific class c ∈ C ={warrior, wizard, thief, animal,
unskilled} and given that ac can join the player’s
ally party A, then L becomes less interesting if |A| =
n and L contains much less elements of A so that
L = {a1 , ..., am } ⊂ A, m  n ∧ ∃ac , c = unskilled.
6. Given n generic dialogues d ∈ D = {d1 , d2 , ..., dn }
that a player can have with the NPCs (Non-Player
Characters) of the game level L, then L becomes
less interesting if contains much less elements of D
so that L = {dk , ..., dm } ⊂ D m  n; given also n
questions q ∈ Q = {q1 , q2 , ..., qn } that the player can
choose during an articulated dialog da ∈ D, then
L becomes less interesting if the dialogues contain
much less elements of Q so that for the most part
of D is da = {q1 , ..., qm } ⊂ Q, m  n.
5.2 Flow game level
The Flow state is characterized by constant balance
between challenge and skills (Fig. 3-b): if challenge be-

6

comes higher then the activity will result overwhelming generating anxiety while the contrary will provoke
boredom: to remain in a Flow state, the player must
continue to learn new skills (Broin [72]). Warpefelt [73]
propose believable NPCs for player’s attention while
Burelli [74] investigates how camera behavior impacts
on the player experience.
The notion of Flow is closely related to that of Fun
but it doesn’t coincide with it: Nakamura et al. [75]
observed chess and sport players, noting that their
enjoyment derives by the mere fact to accomplish their
activity independently by other rewards.
Juul [76] studies the factor of difficulty perceived by
players, arguing that nowadays videogames have become more easy; Zagal and Altizer [77] analyze mechanisms for character progression as a fundamental element of an RPG, while James et al. [78] faces the concept of reward in games, introducing a differentiation
between personal/material/competitive.
A factor which influences the Flow zone is the gamer
expertise which may require gameplay variations: in
order to design a game for broader audiences, the ingame experience can not be linear and static but instead
it needs to offer a wide coverage of potential experiences
to fit different players (i.e. the expansion of the Flow
zone Fig. 3-c). Due to the previous considerations and
with a game design perspective, there are three core
elements needed to evoke the Flow (Chen [79]):
– the game is intrinsically rewarding and the player
desires to play it
– the game offers the right amount of challenge to
match player’s abilities
– player feels a sense of personal control on the
activities and on the user interface
In this game level, challenges involve complex dialogues and multiple goals; at least one ally helps player
to accomplish profitable activities while the level structure includes narrative elements that encourage the environmental exploration.
The specific formal design guidelines are:
1. Given a set of indoor level parts I and a set of
outdoor level parts O, the game level L should
be a set union of outdoor and indoor level parts
L = {I, O}.
2. Given n sets of different assets like textures X1 ,
visual effects X2 , animations X3 , sounds X4 , then L
becomes more atmospheric and fosters imagination
if L = {X1 , X2 , ..., Xn }; the same should be for all
other structural and visual assets like enemy types,
items, 3D models, weapons.
3. Assuming a spatial progression point p to indicate
a game level progression and given a set E of

7.

n type of enemies e, then the player challenge
function fch (e, p) for an encounter with an enemy e
at progression point p has to progressively increase
∀e ∈ E.
For a spatial progression point p, after a set
of progression interval pk in a game level L =
{p1 , p2 , ..., pn }, a reward type rk from a set
R ={ammunition, health pack, experience points,
money, spell, magic item, weapon, armor} should
be given to the player.
There’s at least one main goal Gk so that the victory
condition V = G1 ∧ G2 ∧, ..., ∧Gn = true; the
achievement of V must lead to one or more reward
rk from a set of n rewards R = {r1 , r2 , ..., rn } in
order to gratify the player’s effort.
Considering n characters a featuring skills of a
specific class c ∈ C ={warrior, wizard, thief,
animal} and given that ac can join the player’s ally
party A, then L becomes more interesting if L ⊆ A.
Given n meaningful dialogues d ∈ D =
{d1 , d2 , ..., dn } that a player can have with the NPCs
of the game level L, has to be L ⊆ D; given also n
questions q ∈ Q = {q1 , q2 , ..., qn } that the player can
choose during an articulated dialog da ∈ D, assuming that ∀qk ∈ Q, ank is an answer, then the game
level L becomes more interesting if for the most part
of D is da ⊆ Q ∧ ank is a narrative or ludic element
for reaching a victory condition V , achieve a reward
rk or obtain meaningful information.

6 Develop for Affective Ludology
This section, referring to the formalities of the previous
one, shows the actual implementation of the two game
levels (consisting of smaller pieces called “areas”); the
maps in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 shows player’s paths (also
optional ones) and provide symbols to indicate game
tasks and activities.

6.1 Boredom game level
Three areas have been designed by editing the
2311 tunnels original game area that has linear guided
paths and poor ambient structures (Fig. 6).
This level consists of only one indoor cave environment, characterized by cold texture colors to emphasize
ambient chilliness and repetitiveness; there are no visual effects, no background music or battle sounds and
every NPC has the same 3D model.
The story plot offers a very simple task to accomplish without any gratification and the player can’t upgrade its character due to the lack of experience points;

challenge is minimal with constant difficulty: enemies
lack resistance and combat skills and they don’t attack
in groups (Fig. 6-a). Only two weapons are available
without magical skills and player’s health and munitions are always kept at the maximum value: every dead
enemy releases an health potion and every opened chest
contains munitions and weapons.
The unskilled non-interactive ally is unnecessary
and tedious, in fact he only follows the main character
around the screen using a scripted path-find algorithm;

just some NPCs interact with the player using only
textual dialogues (no animations or camera changes,
Fig. 6-b) that are unbranched and useless, filled by outof-context sentences and with few answers to choose
from.
The first Area is linear and empty, introduces the
ally, and the only dialogue creates false expectations
about the prosecution of the adventure. The second one
follows the same path of the previous one, increasing the
repetitiveness and lowering the player’s expectations.

objects increase player’s skills that can also grow using
the experience points.
6.2 Flow game level
Based on the formal guidelines, the level has been
designed by linking and editing the 3010 highcliff,
3000 castle never, 3063 merchant and 3032 th canyon
original game areas (Fig. 7).
Environmental structures are diversified by indoor
and outdoor areas, each of which rich of 3D models,
items, visual effects (lights, animated water and trees),
weapons, musics and sounds, alternation between day
and night; optional paths and tasks introduce variations
usually appreciated from completist gamers.
A new articulated and progressive story plot offers
well-defined and satisfactory goals (rescue, enrollment,
battles), while challenges steadily increase due to the
variety of enemy types (with better weapons and skills):
previous encountered enemies become harder to defeat
and can perform group attacks and ambushes (Fig. 7-a)
using spells and magical abilities. Rewards are balanced
with skills and challenge: only few enemies (harder to
defeat) release health potions while the chests with
magic objects, ammo and weapons are located only
before or after the more challenging sections; wearable

There is a party of skilled and useful allies (wizard,
warrior, thief) with different ways to enlist them (automatic, dialogue, payment): they are interactive with a
proactive AI and, moreover, additional non-interactive
NPCs like guards and peasants can also help the player.
Dialogues are useful and articulated providing useful information like memories, opinions and narrative
elements (Fig. 7-b) while some of them influence the
prosecution with moral entanglements; they have animations and camera shots and three of them use professional voice-dubbing to stimulate involvement.
An opening dialogue introduces the story-plot, assigning a goal to the player. The area features two combats with an helping NPC and a riddle task. The following area presents voice-dubbed dialogues and an indoor
castle setting; the background music has a fast pace
and a wizard ally automatically joins the party. Area
3 provides an optional path, a group fight, and a dialogue with moral entanglements with the boss enemy.
The next area is even more challenging and ends with
a voice-dubbed moral dialogue about player’s greed,
where the wrong choice will lead to an impossible fight
against a giant dragon. The last area is placed in the

7 Tools and Technologies
The Emotiv EPOC headset is a wireless neuro-signal
acquisition and processing system with 14 wet sensors
(+2 reference), capable of detecting brainwaves at 128
Hz sequential sampling rate; sensors are placed around
the pre-frontal and frontal brain regions according to
the international 10-20 standard system and this process is safe because the headset is a passive measuring
device, less invasive than other physiological methods.
The choice of Neverwinter Nights 2 has been taken
by considering:
– gameplay assets rich of quests, characters and events
– large community with support, tools and mods
– a visual editor (Electron) used even by authors to
create dialogues, NPCs, AI, triggers, visual assets
– powerful C-like scripting language (NWScript) that
allows to manage internal game variables
– XML widgets to customize the game interface
For the experimentation there are two types of data
to extract: internal (environmental and character variables, map coordinates) and external (coming from the
headset). We used NWNX4 [80] to deploy a C++ plugin useful for the communication between Neverwinter Nights 2 and the EEG headset; the tool is opensource and allows to exchange textual messages using
the server version of the game: in this way, a game script
calls the plugin methods to iteratively process the internal and the external data.

As seen in [81] laboratory experimentation originally involved 13 volunteers male academic students tested in a
range hour between 10.00 AM and 07.00 PM on weekdays. For this work we performed further experiments:
6 volunteers female academic students were added to
balance dataset plurality and avoid skewed results by
having about 1/3 of female population. The time duration of an experimental session was about one hour
and half in which subjects were in a silent, empty and
comfortable office room, seated on an adjustable chair.
The first Setup step consists in headset and sensors
placing with signal tuning; after this, a brief explanation about modalities of the study was provided followed by the compilation of a pre-questionnaire about
gaming preferences. The next step is the Tutorial that
allows to familiarize with the user-interface: an experimenter helps the player to perform tasks like “move
the character”, “rotate and zoom the view”, “talk with
a NPC”, “open the inventory or a chest and use items”,
“fight an enemy”, “steal an object”. We consider these
steps a way to induce relaxation and a neutral initial
affective mood (similar to [28, 38, 82]).
A gaming session starts by entering the first level
and the NWNX plugin begins to record the EEG
and game data; after the first game level a postquestionnaire about the player experience is compiled
and the same happens after the second one. Each subject uses the same game character with all statistics set
to average values. Different data sources are available
for each session:
– a video capture of the gaming session
– a pre- and post- questionnaire
– three log files featuring the synchronized game and
EEG data
Fig. 8 shows entries from the data files, each with
common and specific fields. The events log (Fig. 8-1)
contains the timestamp and the tag of the event; the
affective log (Fig. 8-2) has the name of the area, the XY
coordinates and the punctual values of the emotions,
classified by the Emotiv EPOC internal algorithms
(range between 0 and 1); the raw log (Fig. 8-3) collects
the punctual values of the 14 headset sensors.
A game capture video shows a custom XML UIPane
widget used by NWNX to print on the screen the same
timestamp that synchronizes the data (Fig. 9); note
that the data logs determine implicit annotations for
these videos.

data features

Fig. 10 A single activity in the affective log with the sequence
of values that covers its time duration; five numerical features
summarize the punctual values of “Engagement”.

9 Evaluation of EEG data
A game level can be considered as the sequence of
activities which a player faces during his gaming session: this approach allows an interpretation of data
which greatly changes over time highlighting factors
like repetitiveness, environmental changes and ludic interactions. For this study the activities considered are
simple/dubbed/riddle dialogue, single/group fight, chest
open, skills upgrade and stealing task.
We retrieved data by crossing the events log with
the affective log: the first one provides the identifier
and the initial time of the activity (Fig. 8-1) while the
second supplies the affective values, synchronized by
the same timestamp (Fig. 8-2). The amount of affective
data in the entire time duration is given by the sequence
of entries between the initial timestamp and one that
precedes the next event (Fig. 10).
In the Boredom game level, the subjects performed
on average 4.8, 6.1, and 3.7 activities for the tree areas,
respectively. In the Flow game level, they performed
on average 6.8, 8.6, 8.3, and 3.2, activities for the four
areas, respectively. Only 3 subjects managed to reach
the Flow level final area. Overall, more event types are
available for the Flow level, offering a progressive story-

plot with challenges, that require time to evolve in a
natural way to the player’s eyes.
To handle objective affective data we chose a Support Vector Machine (SVM), a machine learning technique that performs a supervised binary classification,
to classify each activity into the two states of Boredom
or Flow. To train the model we use the label associated
to each activity, considering the game level from which
it comes. In this way it is possible to investigate if the
brain-recorded data are characteristic enough to differentiate (separate) among the two sets of guidelines;
if this occurs for a substantial proportion of activities,
then player’s emotions have changed during the gaming
sessions, that is what we wanted to achieve.
The SVM deals with a set of points (feature vectors)
xi along with their categories yi , for some dimension d,
the xi ∈ Rd and the yi = ±1; we are looking for the
best separating hyperplane, defined by a possibly small
set of support vectors.
Some binary classification problems do not have a
simple hyperplane as a separating criterion: for those
problems there is a variant that retains the simplicity of
SVM by applying the kernel trick, to fit the maximummargin hyperplane in a transformed feature space: the
resulting algorithm is formally similar, but every dot
product is replaced by a non-linear kernel function.
In this way the transformation may be nonlinear
and the transformed space high dimensional so, although the classifier is a hyperplane in the transformed
feature space, it may be nonlinear in the original input
space; a common kernel in this class is the Gaussian
Ra− 2σ12 (x−y)0 (x−y)
dial Basis Function (RBF) G(x, y) = e
,
for some positive number σ.

9.1 Data Features and Results
To practically use SVM each emotion associated to a
game activity must have numerical features: a feature
is a single value which summarizes the related sequence
of entries in the affective log recognized during the time
duration (Fig. 10). The features calculated for each of
the five recorded emotions are:
– the angular coefficient β and the intercept α of a
regression line, calculated considering the time T as
a positive variable which constantly increases on the
x-axis; it gives indications on the presence of a trend
for the emotion E
Ei = α + βTi + µi , i : 1..n
where µi is the statistical error

Considering the 19 subjects (13 male and 6 female)
we have a 790x25 predictors matrix M where rows
represent the labeled activities (277 Boredom and 513
Flow) and columns their relative 25 features (five for
each emotion); since the dataset is unbalanced, we
increased the Boredom cases by randomly sampling 236
examples from the original ones, and added them to the
dataset again.
After the extension, M becomes 1026x25 and it is
used to train the SVM in a “leave-one-out” setting with
the RBF kernel: the system is trained n times iteratively
using n − 1 cases and each time the non-linear classifier
is tested with the correspondent example left out.
The use of non-linear kernel functions is a major
change from [81] that brought a marked performance
improvement (accuracy from 70% linear to 92% RBF);
results in Table 1 are very positive and confirm the
goodness for design and development phases highlighting a strong polarization between the classes: all metrics are over 90% with accuracy and f1-score almost the
same for both classes.

9.2 Classification for game level areas
The classification process also considers to which areas
the correctly classified activities belong: in this way it
is possible to understand what the best-designed parts
of a game level are. Results are in Table 2 and 3.
In all Boredom areas activities are well-classified up
to 94% suggesting that they were constantly recognized
as repetitive and tedious; moreover it is remarkable
that while the first two areas are the same, the third
introduces small variations however sufficient to reduce
the perceived boredom.
For the Flow game level, accuracy rating vary but
it is always over 85%: they begin from 85.4% for the
first area and increase to 96.7% for the fourth one: this
gradual progression corresponds to what theorized in
Section 4 and 5, highlighting the goodness of a player
experience characterized by a progressive involvement
with high Engagement and Excitement.

9.3 Classification for activity types
Another useful analysis for the evaluation is to inquire
what the best classified activity types are (results are
in Table 4 and 5).
In the Boredom game level (textual)dialogue is classified best (96.9%) followed by chest opened at 96.1%.
Classification rating is always over 90% evidencing a
correct development phase and sound guidelines supported by the poorness and repetitiveness while dialogues are about 1/3 more numerous than other types
(224 vs. 153 and 136).
In the Flow game level too, dialogues are classified
best, with dubbed and riddle at 100% and simple ones
at 91.2%. The chest opened task is the only under 85%
and, compared with that in Boredom level (-12.5%),
denotes that repetitiveness is better than item variety.
The single fight has the same number of events
of dialogue but it is classified only at 85% (-6.9%
compared to the other game level); fight vs. a group has
a much lower number of events (153 vs. 37) but better
characterization (94.6%) for the Flow game level.
Considering other activities specifically developed
for the Flow gameplay, stealing action and skills upgrade are both at 100% but they have a low number of
examples due to their optionality in the gaming session.

10 Evaluation of Questionnaires
From pre-questionnaires appears that 52.6% of subjects
uses PCs for 2-5 hours daily and 36.8% for more than
6 hours while the time spent to play videogames is
between 4-11 and 12-24 hours per week for this group.
Interest about videogames is strong for 84.2% of
subjects and 78.9% of them has previously played an
RPG one (offline or online).
Considering the gaming platforms, 68.4% prefers
PC, 21% game consoles and 10.5% mobile platforms;

about technical aspects, plot is important for 84.2%,
52.6% prefers graphic, 31.6% dialogues and only 21%
audio assets (multiple answers were allowed).

10.1 Post-Questionnaires
The post-questionnaires in Tables 6, 7 compiled from
the 19 subjects were closed-answer questions with only
one choice allowed.
About player’s general Satisfaction, for Boredom
game level 78.9% of subjects is polarized towards low
values (a little) while for the Flow one 52.6% expresses
a lot, 47.4% little and nobody chooses none. This results
entirely reflect our expectations for the first level and
are reasonable for the Flow one.
The proposed Allies are evaluated in Question 2:
the 94.7% of subjects dislikes the one in Boredom game
level while, for the second game level they are divided
between positive and negative judgment (56.6% versus
47.4%) highlighting the need to reconsider this aspect
in the development phase.
Question 3 evaluates Dialogue satisfaction: subjects
dislike them for Boredom game level (47.4% none and
52.6% little acceptance) while, for the Flow one is
almost the opposite with 57.9% a lot and 42.1% a little.
By considering the perceived Boredom, in Question
4 subjects express enough (52.6%) and a lot (10.5%)
for Boredom game level while for the other one 21%
expresses none and 57.9% a little: this polarization
confirms the goodness of the proposed guidelines.

Affective Level Design for a Role-Playing Videogame Evaluated by ...

About the perceived Frustration, for Boredom game
level subjects are almost divided between positive
and negative judgment (57.9% versus 42.1%) while in
the Flow one frustration results absent or very low
for 89.5% of them: by considering also Question 4
results, this emphasizes a connection between perceived
boredom and the frustration that comes when a gamer
is forced to play something that dislikes.
Question 6 treats the Involvement perceived by
players, for which the majority is polarized between
negative values for Boredom game level (73.7%) and
positive for the Flow one (78.9%): this results fully
confirm the decisions taken.
11 Conclusions and Future work
In this study we presented the formalization of guidelines for RPG videogames and their development in a
famous commercial one; moreover a novel evaluation
methodology based on machine learning was proposed,
presenting encouraging experimental results.
Goodness of the design phase is notable both for
the game level structures and for the implementation
of their activities (tasks and events). Dialogues, the fulcrum of RPG gameplay, proved the ability to manipulate player’s emotions positively and negatively and also
the progression of skills and challenges and the repetitiveness variation appears from the experimentation.
The analysis of the raw affective data will be useful
in order to extract brainwave trends and compare them
with the results provided by the internal algorithms
used here; further studies will inquire about emotional
differences between male and female gamers while it
is possible a further analysis of the tasks grouped
according their type (duels, dialogues) with the aim to
detect trends of their aroused emotions.
Forms of Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA)
mechanisms [83] can benefit from this work, in fact
with real-time classification it could be possible to
change an affective mood during the gaming session.
The recorded game videos might be automatically
analyzed to extract gameplay dynamics like strategies
and behavior patterns as done by Moura et al. [84]
in Dragon Age Origins while also the AI of allies and
NPCs can dynamically take advantage of the proposed
classification method becoming more reactive toward
the player.
Finally, given the extreme variety of game genres,
it can be useful to improve the guidelines in other
videogames featuring different gameplay and interaction modalities like in Obbink et al. [82] and Milam
and El Nasr [85] with the aim to propose a framework
to study and categorize game dynamics and assets.
