Abstract
Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) provides a neuroprosthetic interface to non-recovered
muscle groups by stimulating the affected region of the human body. FES in combination with
Brain-machine interfacing (BMI) has a wide scope in rehabilitation because this system
directly links the cerebral motor intention of the users with its corresponding peripheral muscle
activations. In this paper, we examine the effect of FES on the electroencephalography (EEG)
during motor imagery (left- and right-hand movement) training of the users. Results suggest a
significant improvement in the classification accuracy when the subject was induced with FES
stimuli as compared to the standard visual one.

signal. Takahashi et al.9 also found no effect of FES on
leg stimulation. In this paper, we report the preliminary
results of the effect of electrical stimulation during a
motor imagery training task on healthy subjects and its
comparison with visual stimuli. Through this study, we
aim at employing FES as a proprioceptive feedback to
the brain to improve the learning of the subject both in
terms of accuracy and time. If successful, this system
can accelerate the motor recovery process of the
patient by enhancing the motor learning in the brain.

The

advent of Brain-Machine Interfacing (BMI) has
opened a direct communication pathway between the
brain and the environment in the form of robots,
prosthesis, wheelchair or a computer without any muscle
intervention.1 BMI has immense potential in facilitating
rehabilitation for patients suffering from stroke,
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal injury and physical
disability1. A BMI system would drive a neuroprosthetic
device to bridge the gap between the central nervous
system and peripheric muscles and in some instance
even a separate prosthesis. Electroencephalography
(EEG) signals is the most commonly used BMI
recording device and signals related to limb movement
(known as motor imagery signals) are elicited as Event
Related Desynchronization/Synchronization (ERD/ERS)
response2,3. The BMI system decodes the ERD/ERS
signals to determine the movement as intended by the
user. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES)4,5 aims at
directly stimulating the muscles on the affected side of
the patient and it is reported that FES is capable of
reconstructing certain daily life skills6. Till date, many
researchers7-9 have combined BMI with FES to directly
link the mental intention of the user with a muscular
response. In such a system, the BMI detects the motor
intentions of the user which in turn activates the FES
device. FES activation may affect the sensory pathways,
if intact, which may, in turn impact the cortical activity.
Such phenomena may influence the performance of the
BMI. Gollee et al.8 found no major influence of FES on

Materials and Methods
The EEG recording is conducted using a 14 channel
Emotiv Epoc neuro-headset with a sampling rate of
128Hz and an in-built band-pass filter of 0.2-45Hz.
The electrodes: AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8,
T8, FC6, F4, F8 and AF4, are arranged on the basis of
the standard 10-20 system10. Three healthy male
subjects (2 right handed and one left handed),
participated in this experiment. Two subjects
participated in the BMI experiment as a first
experience whereas one subject was an experienced
BMI user. In this experiment, we abide by the norms of
Helsinki Declaration of 1975, revised in 2000. Prior to
the experiments, the subjects are informed about the
purpose of the experiment and the tasks they have to
perform. Surface electrical stimulation is transmitted to
induce the hand extension tilting towards the back of

Block diagram of our experimental setup during motor imagery sessions where user stimuli is
with conventional visual stimuli, electrical stimulation stimuli or the combined, respectively

the hand by applying the stimulation to the extensor
digitorum muscle. It is applied to each side of the hand
respectively, corresponding to right/left motor imagery
task. The stimulus is delivered by a computer-controlled
stimulator (ProStim, MXM, France) with PW
modulation (PW max = 450 us) at a constant amplitude
and frequency (30 Hz). Each stimulation sequence
consists of a trapezoidal envelope train of PW (0.4 s
ramp-up, 1.2 s plateau, 0.4 s ramp-down). The
experiment designed for this work is divided into three
sessions: only visual, only FES and both visual-FES
stimuli. The sessions consist of instructing the subjects
through a sequence of repetitive stimuli to execute the
corresponding motor imagery task, which in our case, is
left and right hand movement. One sequence of stimulus
is known as trial. A trial for the visual stimulus is
designed as follows: First, a blank screen is projected to
the subject for 20s, which provides the baseline of the
EEG. Then, a fixation '+' is displayed on the screen for
1s which is an indicator to the subject to get ready for the
task. Next, the instructions are provided to the subject
for 3 seconds in the form of arrows. According to the
direction of the arrow, the subject imagines either left or
right hand movement. Following the instructions, a
blank screen is again displayed for 1.5s-3.5s. The FES
session is similar to the visual one except in place of the
arrows, stimulation is directly induced in the fore-arm of
the hand of interest, without providing any visual
information. In the Visual-FES session, both the
combined stimulations are time-synchronized to each
other. Each session is composed of 40 trials (20 for each
movement). After acquisition, the incoming raw EEG
signal is band-pass filtered at 8-30 Hz. Then, common
spatial filters (CSP) is applied to extract features relevant
to left- and right-motor hand movement EEG signals.
CSP is a spatial filter widely used in BMI because the
spatial patterns contain highly discriminative features
between two classes.11 In this study, we prepare the
feature vectors using 6 spatial filters which is then
transferred as inputs to a linear discriminant analysis
(LDA) classifier.12 Finally, the classifier detects the
corresponding motor intention of the subject, i.e., left
and right motor movement. A block diagram of our

experimental setup during Visual-FES session is
illustrated in Fig. 1.

Results
In this paper, we first attempt to observe the difference
of the spatial patterns during the sessions: visual, FES
and visual+FES. For this purpose, we determine the
power spectral density (PSD)13 of each spatial filters.
The PSD distribution for six spatial filters of subject 1
is shown in Fig. 2. As observed from the figure, the
patterns are highly discriminable for the first four
filters and they overlap in the last two. it is also noted
that FES+Visual session (in black) has the highest
power followed by Visual (in blue) session and lastly
FES session (in red) for the first three filters. A similar
trend is noted for the other two subjects too. Next, we
employ 10 cross validation12 on the dataset, where at
every iteration, one block of data is randomly selected
for testing and the rest of the block are employed for
training. Table I presents the average classification
accuracy (over 10 runs) and it is noted that for Subject
01 and 02 (with first BMI experience) the accuracy
during FES session increases by 6.28% and 5.51% as
compared its visual counterpart. The difference
between the FES and Visual+FES sessions are small.
On the other hand, Subject 03 (with previous BMI
experience) has a better result during the visual session
than the FES session. Thus, it can be inferred from this
result that subjects with no prior BMI training of motor
imagery show a significant improvement in learning
when induced with FES.

Discussion
In this paper, we aimed at studying the effect of
electrical stimulation as a user stimuli for motor
imagery classification (left and right hand movement)
in BMI. Fig. 2 shows a significant difference of the
spatial patterns during the three stimuli sessions:
visual, FES and visual+FES. Results on Table I also
shows a significant rise in accuracy for 2 (of 3)
subjects which suggest a positive influence of FES
during motor imagery training of the subjects. It was
noted that both the subjects had no previous experience

on BMI, then they were not familiar with generating
motor imagery with visual stimuli. Visual stimuli are the
widely accepted form of motor training but the subject
requires constant training to reach an optimal result.
Based on the results of this study, we can infer that
electrical stimulation can also be used for motor training
and it can potentially provide better performance as it
can make natural proprioceptive feedback related to
motor performance than visual stimuli which requires
user's recognition regarding the visual cue. Further
studies on a larger group of subjects are required to
validate this claim. Future studies in this research will
include studying the effect of FES as proprioceptive
neuro-feedback training to BMI. This will lead to an
improvement in motor imagery classification which
helps would aid in neuro-prosthetic or robot control14.
