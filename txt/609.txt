Abstract
Brain Computer Interface is a technology where the real time brain activity is recorded and transmitted to an analyzer to interpret.
BCI in Classroom will assist the facilitator and well as the learner. The facilitator can design the content in suitable to the learner
learning style and provide Neuro-Feedback of the concentration applied and knowledge gained through computer based assessment.
If the feedback is not considerate to the standard value, further motivation can be provided to enhance the learning process. This
paper explains how to analyses BCI signals in the real life classroom environment ,method of study the Signals of an individual
while performing a predefined task, procedure to procure, understand and evaluate the EEG signals. Analysis the EEG signals is
done to interpret the brain signals based on frequency ranges depicting different waves Alpha, Beta, Gamma waves, an Algorithm
was implemented in classifying the concentration levels as learning outcomes by taking Beta Waves into consideration for a set of
students. This process helps to assess the learning outcome and academic performance of more than one learner by using BCI in the
real life environment. The cognition levels of the learner are facilitated and motivation provided for better performance.

Introduction

In this era of practical oriented teaching, Teacher design
content in various format like models, Audio-Visuals etc.
before going to class. Interactive teaching styles promote an
atmosphere of attention and participation. If the teacher wants
to check the Attention-grabbing component, different methods
have been applicable till now. Is there a method where we can
directly read the signals from the student brain and interpret
the signal and measure the cognitive performance? The
content designer can do the required changes before taking the
actual lecture. Our brains process information and conduct the
signals continuously on many kinds of levels, only some of
which are consciously directed. But, conscious or not, the
important thing to understand is that it is our brains that are
doing the learning, and that this process is only indirectly
related to the teacher and the teaching. This is a challenge to
see what actually exists in the brains of students. This is the
"summative" aspect. It is the easiest aspect to understand and

it is well described in the literature. A classroom of students
sitting and watching their teacher impart upon them the
concepts and Theories. The little wonder what was going on
inside their heads? Just how does the information they are
taking in become actual knowledge?
Cognition is a process referred to mental abilities pertaining to
knowledge, attention, working of memory, judgment,
evaluation, reasoning, problem solving and decision making.
Cognitive processes utilize existing knowledge and generate
advance knowledge. The Memory ability is our capacity to
register, store, and recover information over time more
precisely the persistence of learning over time. Human
memory can be affected by how well we focus on attention,
motivation that we practice.
Memory is the cognitive process where brain holds some
information or skills derived from the environment. It just
doesn’t memorize information but also understands concepts.

This memory helps to develop the knowledge of an individual.
To measure the amount of knowledge gained, spatial memory
in the cognitive psychology can be measured. Some
instruments have been developed to measure cognitive
memory but had some limitations. Sensory, short-term and
long term memory classifies the memory. When an item is
perceived, it lasts in the memory for 200-500 milliseconds.
Sensory memory is sensual to feeling, look and gaze and store.
After a period of time of gaze an incidence is recollected then
it is Short term memory. If the data is stored for longer duration
then it is Long term memory. Spatial memory is the ability to
generate, represent, transform and recall information. Both
short term and long term memory have been traditionally
assessed using animals. An application called ARSM task has
been developed to measure spatial memory in children. Spatial
short term memory has the ability to handle complex cognitive
tasks such as problem solving using mathematical methods,
number writing and magnitude judgment. The spatial memory
is also predicts the learning outcome and the academic
performance acquiring academic skills and other impact to
academic performance. ARSM (Augmented Reality Spatial
Memory)[1] is an application to assess and evaluate spatial
short term memory in children involving movement unlike the
BCI (brain computer Interface). Koening[1] developed
VMT(Virtual memory Task) which gives the causes of brain
cognitive defects in brain injury and the novelty of task
concluded by comparing the virtual environment with the real
environment but it lacked the attain focus on spatial short term
memory load which had not been taken account in relation with
real world environment.
1.1 Brain computer Interface
The need arises if the measurement of spatial memory helps to
assess the learner’s capability, then how to measure the spatial
memory for cognitive process. One of the procedures to
measure the spatial memory is by using BCI (Brain Computer
Interface) which is also referred as Brain Machine Interface
(BMI) which is hardware and software communication system
that facilitate humans to connect with their environment
without the involvement of peripheral nerves and muscles
inputs by using control signals generated from
electroencephalographic activity (EEG). The BCI technology
has been traditionally been unattractive for very serious
scientific investigation. Earlier this investigation of reading
signals from brain activity has been limited to explore
neurological disorders[2]. The BCI activity was too complex
because of limited resolution and reliability of information that
is detectable in the brain and its high variability. The chances
of using BCI as auxiliary technology that has helped severely
disabled people proportionally increased social acceptance and
need to accelerate the progress. Small specialized companies
such as EMOTIV [3] and NEUROSKY[4] have developed
applications oriented to the public domain. BCI uses brain
signal to derive information on user intentions. It relay on
measuring brain activity and translate information into

traceable electrical signals.
The BCI system takes the bio-signal measured from a person
and abstracts some status of cognitive state. The bio-signal are
considered and passed through BCI interface and the
prediction of different cognitive state is done. There are three
types of BCI 1) Active BCI 2) Reactive BCI 3) Passive BCI.
The passive BCI helps to measure the work load and attention
levels and focus levels. This research is targeted towards nonpassive BCI. The modern BCI has Jung et all [5] wireless
headset and a portable interfacing and processing devices.
1.2 EEG (Electroencephalogram)
EEG measures electric brain activity caused by flow of electric
currents during synaptic excitations of the dendrites in the
neurons. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) are one of the
techniques which provide an electrical representation of bio
signals that reflect changes in the activity of the human brain.
The approach of BCI and their evolution within the last
decades has provided a synopsis of the relevant methodologies
and algorithms that are used to analyze EEG signals. When you
are when actively engaged or paying attention, the brain emits
a signal – an attention signature. The major challenge of the
teacher is to analyze and evaluate the understanding aspect of
the student, which will further motivate in the teaching
effectively. The evaluation methods till now including the
exam pattern of answering descriptive, subjective questions.
This has some far fulfilled the needs of evaluation system.
Luis Fernando et al, Brain Computer Interfaces[3] has not be
taken much potential proven outside the laboratory because of
its robustness and We therefore identify the flaws in BCI
training protocols according to instructional design principles
at several levels in the instructions provided to the user in the
tasks he/she has to perform and in the feedback provide. The
poor performance is due to the signal processing algorithms for
analysis of EEG [6] signals. Electroencephalography (EEG) is
the neurophysiologic measurement of the electrical activity of
the brain In 1875, the presence of electrical current in the brain
was discovered by English physician [7] in a spontaneous and
continuous manner derived from mammals. In 1912, A
Russian physiologist named Vladimir [7] published a paper
after the detection of the first brain signals and evoked
potentials in mammals (dog).The German neurologist Hans
Berger[8] recorded the first human brain signal in 1924,which
was the beginning of knowing that electrical signals were
present and can be recorded. The device was named EEG in
accordance with the observation of Berger [9]. The readings of
the amplified brain activity are recorded on graph
paper[7].Technologically advanced EEG equipment and
introduced concentric needle electrodes. In 1935,[10]
described the characteristic form of spike waves, which started
the field of clinical electroencephalography. After World War
II, the researchers have tried to develop various methods of
detection, purification, and classification of brain signals to
diagnose abnormal signals. In the 1950s, [11] Developed an
EEG topography, which enhanced the mapping of electrical

196

Rebakah Jobdas et al / International journal of research in engineering and innovation (IJREI), vol 2, issue 2 (2018), 195-200

activity taking place across the exterior of the brain. This
topography was used in psychiatry until the 1980s[12]. From
the year 1990 to 2000, many approaches were developed to
process EEG signal such as Blind Source Separations (BSS)
and Independent Component Analysis ICA.
The Application of AR are incorporated in diverse fields
including human behavior [12]. AR is also used in education
for the beneficiary visual alertness of students, by super
imposing the virtual elements on the real space for immersive
visualization. Mobile devices as equipped with all advanced
features support AR applications at any point of time.
Nevertheless, to our knowledge, one field lacking to assess AR
is to evaluate cognitive processes. Mobile AR systems have
already proven their potential in educational field. For
example, [1] a digital game in developed using a gadget from
the Nokia family in spreading awareness and importance of
recycling and teaching participants how to achieve desired
results. AR game in comparison of a video game, the
following parameters
Like the level of participation, friendly use and perception
involved during the execution of the game and the perceived
learning about recycling had increased and created more
awareness. A positive inclination is detected with respect to
both the games [1] developed a game for learning the water
cycle and compared the results using gadgets like an iPhone
and a Tablet. The observation has derived that physical
characteristics of the gadget like size and weight did not
influence the learning curiosity and amount of participation in
the experiment.[1] iPhone game is developed for learning
multiculturalism, to achieve harmony and develop tolerance.
Two different groups playing on mobile with the group playing
traditional games have not shown significant difference [13] in
comparison of a mobile AR system with a textbook material
pertaining to forensic medicine, Only 10 third-year medical
students participated in the study. Their results showed a
statistically increase in knowledge acquired for the AR group.
[14] presented mobile AR-based learning material in EFL
English (English as a Foreign Language), Only 5 participants
took part in the study. The results showed that the participants
were engaged in the learning scenario, constructed linguistic
and content knowledge, and produced meaningful essays. Use
of AR has proved much desired results and the users were
much benefited with high level of understanding. By
integrating augmented reality into the lectures, it can capture
the attention of your audience confirming undivided attention,
motivating audiences participate. Students are able to access
models on their own devices via Augment’s app. By
visualisation of these augmented models, the students gain
a better understanding of the concepts they are studying. The
fun way to engage students and reinforce concepts they’ve
seen during class lectures.With Augment, you do not have to
invest in physical materials. Students are given access to
experiment on the models from any device at any
time. Whether they are at home or in the classroom, students
can study and interact with the course materials. In the digital
era, students are constantly triggered with the use of

augmented reality. The students are motivated by new ideas
and can think critically about the world around them. Factors
such as publication year, learner type (e.g., K-12, higher
education, and adult), technologies in AR, and the advantages
and challenges of using AR in educational settings are studied.
The most reported advantage of AR is that it promotes
enhanced learning achievement through live visualization.
The measuring of brain signals through an EEG headset,
involving bio signal analysis is one of the most important
topics that researchers have tried to develop during the last
century to understand numerous human diseases.
Electroencephalograms (EEGs) are one of the techniques
which provide an electrical representation of bio signals that
reflect changes in the activity of the human brain[15].
A challenge for the teacher is to help students in allowing them
to concentrate more and to perform better. The learners can
improve their attention problems, cognitive problems (mental
skills that don’t allow us to perform at our best) and behavioral
problems but once if the learners or the teachers know how
much level of concentration is made to understand a subject.
It’s a proven fact that Greater attention equals to greater
learning. Attributes like Attention, concentration can be
measured by measuring brain activity which is indicative of
attention[16]. The research will help to collect signals from
brain and later analyses them to an algorithm to find out the
concentration levels in a learner.
Learner can activate great cognitive games by applying full
attention to get started by using BCI devices. This technology
can actually move game characters by mind/attention alone. If
attention is lost, the game will exit until they fully apply
themselves again. So, cognitive games + Play Attention’s
attention monitor = huge differences in success[17]. The
Research works by tracking brain-wave activity as games are
played or engage in virtual-reality simulations[18]. When
synapses fire, they release electrical pulses that move through
the body. The device uses three carbon contacts to tap the
signal through the skin or the brain electrodes, while software
filters out electrical interference from moving muscles,
particularly the heart[10].A program paradigm is included for
virtual training scenarios using games or virtual-reality[19],
and it prevents you from engaging in any program until you're
in the zone. To determine focus, the Research looks for brainactivity patterns indicative of attention, including beta-level
waves from 12 to 30 hertz[20], which neurologists consent as
a mark of attained concentration. Till the present time , the
research was carried out from one learner to one monitor, if we
include no of headset at one particular time , all the headsets
will connected with a IOT protocol and all the signals
connected via ARM processor with which it goes to the
feedback computer. The teacher if can analysis the signals in
real time, they can concentrate more on the students and
change their way of delivery to meet the needs. Brain
Computer Interface[9] is the fast working system with less
errors as it does not contain human transfer at all. Cognitive
computing[21] is also emerging area as few major companies
like IBM started a machine called as “IBM Watson”, Google

197

Rebakah Jobdas et al / International journal of research in engineering and innovation (IJREI), vol 2, issue 2 (2018), 195-200

has started a App like “GOOGLE Now”. The possibility of
BCI will be used in future for “opportunistic applications’’
The teacher explains the concept using Augmented Reality; the
learners will wear an authentication band to and enter the class.
The authentication is taken and learner is given access into the
Augmented Reality LAB, the learners will be given a headband
which has dry electrodes as they wear the headband as a cap,
the electrodes gets fitted on the scalp and as the learner attends
the class, the headband will obtain signals from the brain and
are transferred into a computer for signal processing. The
signals are interpreted to an algorithm depending upon the
Delta, Alpha, Beta and Theta waves; we can determine the
concentration depending upon the spatial memory of the
cognitive skills.

(Beta3, 22-38Hz) is highly complex thought, integrating new
experiences, high anxiety, or excitement. Continual high
frequency processing is not a very efficient way to run the
brain, as it takes a tremendous amount of energy. Our main
concentration is on Beta waves because these waves represent
the cognition process like thinking, reasoning, concentration
and attention levels.

Delta wave (1 to 3.9 Hz)

Delta brainwaves are the low frequency waves but strong
brainwaves. They are produced in time of meditation and
dreamless sleep. Delta waves append the external awareness
and are the source of empathy. This undisturbed sleep is
needed to needed by the body for healing and regeneration.
1.2.2

Theta wave (4 to 7.9 Hz)

Theta brainwaves occur most often in sleep when we are
dreaming, intuition and sixth sense information is imparted and
are connected to the past troubled history. In theta, senses are
isolated from the external world and focused on signals
originating from inner conscious.

Feature Extraction

When the data which is to analyze from the device is sent to an
algorithm as mentioned in Figure1. Data if bulky and
redundant is subjected and transformed to a set of specific
features [24].

Alpha Wave (8 to 13.9 Hz)
2.1 Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)

Alpha brainwaves are prevalent with the present environment
during thought process , and in some meditative states,
detected better than Beta brain waves when a person is in
creative zone, recreation, stress free. Alpha is ‘the power of
now’, being here, in the present[22]. While the brain activity
includes the mental coordination, calmness, alertness,
mind/body integration Alpha is the inactive state.
1.2.4

Beta waves (12 to 38 Hz)

“Beta waves are generated ranging from 13 to 60 pulses per
second in the Hertz scale associated with focus, alert, agitated
and dominate our normal waking state of consciousness and
alpha waves are generated in relaxed, calm or quiet the mind,”
says Garten[23]. Human brain is usually in beta mode while
performing routine task, but as the complexity and reasoning
increase, the alpha rhythm is detected. To reduce the activity
in the brain techniques like meditation and mindfulness is
practiced releasing increased levels of beta-endorphins and
dopamine. Beta brainwaves are further divided into three
frequencies; Low Beta (Beta1, 12-15Hz) can be thought of as
a 'fast idle, or musing. Beta (Beta2, 15-22Hz) is high
engagement or actively figuring something out. Hi-Beta

It is a method to convert time series signals into frequency
components. It is used to calculate Max, Min, and Mean Value
of EEG signals
2.2 Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)
This process feature extraction EEG feature extraction is done
by using wavelet transform. But there are multiple wavelets
available in the wavelet family therefore a suitable wavelet has
to be chosen for the efficient extraction of different feature of
EEG. EEG features mainly contains the different frequency
bands.
2.3 K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
K-nearest neighbor is an instance-based, lazy and supervised
learning algorithm. KNN is a simple algorithm that stores all
available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity
measure. KNN is a non-parametric method that classifies the
data by comparing the training data and testing data based on
estimating the feature values.

2.4 Linear Discriminant Analysis
(LDA) is one of the most popular classification algorithms for
Brain Computer Interface applications, and has been used
successfully in a large number of systems. LDA linearly
transforms data from high dimensional space to low
dimensional space. Finally, the decision is made in the low
dimensional space.

brainwaves on the screen. The analysis is classified as the
signals pertaining to attention and meditation, which gives a
magnitude of the brainwaves to envision the acquired signals,
will be displayed on the computer.
3.1 Algorithm

It can be interpreted from two views: Objective and Subjective.
The Subjective probability is called as Bayesian
Probability[14]. Bayesian Probability is the process for using
the probability for predicting the likelihood of certain events
occurring in the future. Naive Bayes is a conditional
probability model where Bayes’ theorem is used to infer the
probability of hypothesis under the observed data or evidence.

Step 1: The BCI data signals are collected from the instrument
Step 2: The Signals are converted into CSV format and further
analysis
Step 3: If the value of x =1, retrieve the bands of EEG
Step 4: Statistical analysis is done while calculating the
learning styles of the learner
Step 5: if x! = 1, end the loop
Step 6: Exit
After implementation of the algorithm, the EEG band are
retrieved and saved into a CSV format for further analysis with
respect to time and the frequency range of each band.

2.6 Support Vector Machine (SVM)

3.2 Flow Chart

2.5 Naive Bayes Probability

The following factors are classified for EEG signals. The
factors are Stability, low
variance, regularization term,
maximum margin method, Gaussian Kernel, smoothing
parameter, Matthews’s correlation co-efficient. Once the
preprocessing is done, next task is to classify the signal into
appropriate stress level. When a single classifier is used, it is
difficult to identify the misclassification error. The solution to
this problem is to develop a more complex classifier with a
little misclassification rate. This approach may seem
promising but it will make the system complex. Combination
of simple classifiers can be experimented rather than using one
complex classifier. One more advantage of this approach is that
even if one of the classifier misclassifies the data, the other
classifiers can rectify this error.

Classification Algorithm

The above experimental setup shows the Mind Wave sensor
which is made available to wear on any subject for acquiring
the EEG data from the scalp of the subject, the environment is
set up with the entire required prerequisite and headband is safe
and friendly use, then extracted EEG signal is connected to a
digital device via Bluetooth. This step includes data extraction
from the scalp and the analog signals are converted to digital
signals, the headband sensor collects the data through the
Think Gear Sensor placed on the scalp. EEG signals are
detected when there is a potential difference across the brain
when a neural activity takes place. These signals are monitored
through Neuro Sky brain-computer interface technology. The
input signals are collected through think gear chip, for further
interpretation. After further analysis this signals are
mathematical analyzed and displayed as output digital
messages to the system, permitting to understand the

Conclusion

The Brain signals are analyzed and converted to measures of
numbers, use of EEG signals of a student through wearable
technology can be utilized for the purpose of tracing student
attendance and authentication. To supplement the learner for
higher level of understanding by immersive visualization with
the use of Latest teaching methodology like Augmented
Reality. BCI Data could be used as a metric for the design of
learning resource because they allow establishing the extent to
which students are engage in learning activities. The task is
more challenging with the given variety of course components
setting modest goals and using low-demanding technologies
for practice of everyday session.
