states in neurodevelopment disorder
Ekansh Sareen, Anubha Gupta, Rohit Verma, G. Krishnaveni Achary, and Blessin Varkey
Abstract— There has been an emerging interest in the study of
functional brain networks in cognitive neuroscience in order to
better understand brain responses to different stimuli. Such
studies can help in understanding brain connectivity alterations
that arise in neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual
disability (ID). This research contributes to this body of knowledge
by studying alterations in brain connectivity in ID compared to the
typically developing controls (TDC). Electroencephalography
(EEG) data of subjects with ID and TDC is collected through
limited channel dry electrode system. Data was analyzed for the
auditory and rest state processing along with the study of intranetwork connectivity of the brain via clustering coefficients.
Research findings indicate evidences for links between the sensory
deficits and social impairment in ID individuals.

I. INTRODUCTION

N

EURODEVELOPMENT refers to the development of
neurological pathways that influence the performance and
functioning of brain in activities such as social skills, memory,
attention, etc. Significant and continued disruption to these
dynamically inter-related processes through environmental and
genetic risks may lead to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD)
and disability [1]. NDD are prominently linked with the
impairment in growth and development of central nervous
system during early developmental stages [2]. They are
associated with a wider range of functionally-diagnosed
conditions such as intellectual disability (ID) [3], autism,
cerebral palsy, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) as well as medically diagnosed conditions like Down
syndrome, Fragile X syndrome or fetal alcohol syndrome [4].
Thus, there is a need for more focused research to provide a
wide array of clinical and social supportive services around the
needs of such subjects and their families [5].
The focus of this study is on intellectually disabled (ID)
population. ID subjects are generally identified by adaptive,
cognitive, and social skill deficits [6], and are often
accompanied by challenging behavior such as an increased risk
of injury [7]. Despite considerable research in exploring
psychiatric and social morbidity of ID, little is understood about

its association with brain development and organization. This
has prompted researchers to adopt different neuroimaging and
brain network extraction methods to understand the structural
and functional connectivity in response to specific activities.
Structural Connectivity (SC) explores the anatomical
connections between brain regions, whereas Functional
Connectivity (FC) looks at the interaction between brain
regions that aligns with either cognitive performance or brain’s
default state [8]. FC can be measured using statistical methods
such as correlation, phase coherence, and covariance [9]. This
helps in understanding the synchronization of inter-related
activities among brain regions via the construction of functional
brain networks (fBNs). These fBNs play an important role in
understanding the cognitive behaviour of brain. For example,
FC has been helpful in extracting motor [10], visual [11],
language [12], default mode [13] and attention [14] networks.
In the field of neuroimaging, brain connectivity is
predominantly studied in response to certain stimuli, i.e., while
the subject is engaged in a task. A lot of research has been done
in exploring brain connectivity by examining stimulusgenerated brain responses when engaged in cognitive tasks.
Music perception is one such task that is known to generate
cognitive and perceptive responses linked to memory and
emotions [15]. Recent studies have suggested significantly
enhanced phase synchrony while listening to music as
compared to resting condition in healthy subjects [16], [17].
Related studies have also observed that there exist different
degrees of functional cooperation between two adjacent brain
regions in several musical perception tasks [17]. From a graph
theoretical point of view, musical perception depicts increased
FC and enhanced small-world network organization.
To explore neurobiology of brain disorders such as ID,
studies have adopted different neuroimaging techniques, say
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG) and
magnetoencephalography (MEG) [9]. Use of different data
modalities can provide complimentary views on brain
connectivity and its variation. Although EEG has better
temporal resolution and is more accessible with reference to
cost and ease compared to fMRI, it is not utilized actively to
extract fBNs, while a plethora of research studies have made
use of fMRI for the same. EEG also holds a practical and
theoretical advantage in elucidating clinical biomarkers [18]. In
fact, it is one of the most cost-effective and clinically-available
modalities for mass recording and monitoring treatment

outcomes [18], [19]. Recent studies are using EEG to study
cognitive load in NDD like Autism [20]. This study is also
aimed at exploring EEG data modality for providing an
understanding of brain connectivity in ID versus typically
developing control (TDC) individuals.
Since graph-theoretic and network science measures are used
to assess communication efficiency and organization of
networks, they are extensively used to study fBN organization
[21]. This study is aimed at finding communities with densely
connected set of nodes, but with inter-community connections
being scanty in the network. Research has suggested that these
community structures indicate strong inter-neuron connections
that contribute to functional responses within the brain. Studies
have suggested that the prominent network science measures
like shorter path length and higher clustering are linked with
better cognitive abilities, while deviant brain topologies may be
indictors of neuropsychiatric disorders [22]. Thus, exploring
fBN organization through the lens of graph theoretic models in
neuropsychiatric disorder such as ID is of great relevance.
Advancements in brain network analysis has entailed the
need for integration of statistical tools with brain network
analysis [24]. Generally, a univariate metric is used to
summarize and compare networks with simple tests (e.g. t-test,
F-test etc.). These approaches are often used because of their
simplicity, but they do not account for local connectivity trend
within the network [25]. The network-based statistics (NBS)
[26] is one of the few methods that accounts for comparison of
nodal properties or local connectivity patterns of a network.
However, it fails to account for the topological differences in
the entire network of a subject or a group. Thus, there is a need
of a statistical measure that considers the local connectivity
pattern as well as group differences at the network level. In this
work, we propose a group level comparison measure which is
inspired from the work of Simpson et al. [25], where they used
permutation-testing framework to compare a group of networks
while incorporating topological features inherent in individual
networks. On the similar lines, this study proposes a method
that incorporates this permutation-testing framework with a
graph-theoretic measure called global clustering coefficient for
assessment of group differences at the network level.
For ID individuals, identification of brain connectivity
patterns in response to stimuli can enable interventions to these
subjects that can assist their caregivers, researchers and the
society, in filling the educational gaps and providing them with
a better lifestyle. This research study provides a framework to
explore functional connectivity and brain network organization
in ID using EEG. This work tested and verified the working of
EMOTIV’s EPOC+ 14-channel EEG machine that is portable
and cost-effective device. Also, this device overcomes
experimental limitations associated with the clinical population
of interest, i.e., people with ID who are not comfortable with
the pasting of wet electrode EEG system. This work also
explored the brain network organization associated with music
apprehension task in two groups, i.e., ID and TDC, and provides
cognitive reasoning for the same. Finally, this work provides a
statistical framework to differentiate between ID and TDC
groups by using the proposed permutation-testing framework.

II. MATERIALS
A. Participants
A total of ten typically developing controls (TDC) and seven
intellectually challenged participants took part in the study.
Both ID and TDC participants were recruited from NaiDisha
Centre, Tamana NGO, New Delhi, India. The ID participants
were diagnosed under code range of F70-F79 of ICD-10
medical classification list of mental retardation by World
Health Organization (WHO). The age of ID participants (all
male), ranged from 26 to 31 years (age = 28.661.966) with
Intelligence Quotient (IQ) from 52 to 68 (mean IQ:
59.1675.8452) and Social Quotient (SQ) from 57 to 62 (mean
SQ: 59.6672.0656). The age of TDC participants (all male)
ranged from 18 to 56 years (age = 33.8514.89). Approval for
the experiment was granted by the Institute’s Ethics Committee
and the experiment was performed in accordance with the
ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki
under the expert guidance of caregivers who work with NDD
population. Malin’s Intelligence Scale for Indian Children
(MISIC) that is an Indian adaptation of Wechsler’s Intelligence
Scale for Children (WISC) and Vineland Social Maturity Scale
were the standardized tools used for the evaluation of IQ and
SQ of ID population, respectively.
B. EEG recording and pre-processing
Raw Electroencephalogram (EEG) data was acquired using
a 14-channel wireless EEG headset called EPOC by Emotiv
[27] with a sampling rate of 128Hz using a subscription-based
software Emotiv Xavier. It uses saline-based wet sensors
instead of sticky gels which was a distinguishing feature with
other similar products available in the market. Fig. 1 depicts the
14 electrodes of Emotiv EPOC relative to 10-20 electrode
system. Fig. S1 (Supplementary) depicts the parcellation of
brain into Brodmann Areas (BA), while Table-S1 lists BA
along with the cognitive functionality of these electrodes.
The subject was seated on a comfortable chair in relaxed
position with the wireless headset placed over the head. He was
briefed about the experiment having 2 minutes of silence (rest
state) and 4-5 minutes of a song (music state). Earphones were
plugged in the ears for the auditory stimulus and eyes were
closed throughout the session. The subject was also instructed
to not engage in stressful thinking during the rest state.
Recorded raw EEG data files were first header-fixed using
the EDF Browser software [28] to make these compatible for
loading in EEGLAB for filtering, correction, and visualization.
Next, the EEG data was filtered and pre-processed using the
pipeline implemented using EEGLAB [29] and MATLAB. The
pre-processing pipeline included selection of 14 channels of
Emotiv and was performed in EEGLAB. This data was filtered
using a high pass filter with a lower frequency cut-off set at
0.5Hz in EEGLAB to minimize filtering artifacts at epoch
boundaries. A customized channel location file for the
EMOTIV device which contains the spatial orientation of its
electrodes was created and added. For removing artefacts from
the EEG data, Independent Components Analysis (ICA)
decomposition of the data using infomax algorithm was

performed in EEGLAB. Next, ADJUST plugin [30] was used
that automatically computes a set of spatial and temporal
features for each of the independent components (ICs).
Artefacts are associated with temporal and spatial features as
follows: 1) Eye Blinks: Spatial Average Difference (SAD) and
Temporal Kurtosis (TK), 2) Vertical eye movements: SAD and
Maximum Epoch Variance (MEV), 3) Horizontal eye
movement: Spatial Eye Difference (SED) and MEV, and 4)

stacked to create a 3D tensor Ws(t) of size 𝑁 × 𝑁 × 𝑇. Thus,
we obtained 𝑆 number of 3D tensors.

ADJUST displays all ICs along with their features. ICs, that
cross the pre-determined thresholds of both spatial and
temporal features of any artifact listed above, are highlighted
by ADJUST. Finally, the marked artefact components were
removed and the new dataset was saved. Here, with 14-channel
data, only the worst two components (identified by visual
inspection) of all the ADJUST-classified components were
rejected. Resulting data was reconstructed to obtain clean,
filtered, and artifact-free EEG signal. Fig. 2 provides the
flowchart of the steps taken in pre-processing of EEG data. This
data was then subdivided according to the rest and music state
event markings and was analyzed next.
III. METHODS
A. Functional connectivity analysis
This study uses partial correlation (PC) to measure statistical
coupling between EEG signals. PC coefficients quantify
correlation between two sensors, while being controlled for
other sensors [32]. Unlike correlation, it prevents false
prediction of direct link between two sensors. If rij is the
Pearson correlation between ‘i’ and ‘j’, rik is the Pearson
correlation between ‘i’ and ‘k’, and rjk is the Pearson correlation
between ‘j’ and ‘k’, with k=1,2,...m as the other sensors to be
controlled for, then PC Pij between sensors ‘i’ and ‘j’ is

FC analysis was performed as follows: the pre-processed
time-series EEG data comprising of 𝑁 = 14 channels was
subdivided into 𝑇 number of non-overlapping static windows
of 𝐿 samples (say 𝐿=32) each, resulting in a 2D matrix (or a
slice) of size 𝑁 × 𝐿. Next, the adjacency matrix was built using
the PC of size 𝑁 × 𝑁. All time windows of subject ‘s’ were

B. Temporal summarization for extracting static connectivity
To study the static FC, connectivity matrix Ws(t) of subject s
was temporally summarized via Higher Order Singular Vector
Decomposition (HOSVD), also known as Tucker
Decomposition [33], as
𝑾𝒔 (𝑡) = 𝑪 ×1 𝑼(1) ×2 𝑼(2) ×3 𝑼(3) ,
(2)
where C ∈ ℝ𝑁×𝑁×𝑇 is the core tensor and the three orthonormal
mode matrices containing the left singular vectors
corresponding to each of three modes are depicted by U(1) ∈
ℝ𝑁×𝑁 , U(2) ∈ ℝ𝑁×𝑁 , and U(3) ∈ ℝ𝑇×𝑇 or the horizontal, frontal
and vertical unitary matrices of Ws(t). Unfolding the tensor
along the desired mode using singular value decomposition
(SVD) results in the corresponding mode matrices. Since the
column space of U(3) spans the temporal direction, the singular
vector corresponding to the highest singular value is utilized for
temporal summarization. To achieve this, Ws(t) was flattened
2
(3)
as 𝐖𝑠 (𝑡) ∈ ℝ𝑇×𝑁 and SVD was applied to find the singular
vector of u(3,1) that is associated with the largest singular value.
This vector captures the most significant contribution in time.
Thus, u(3,1) is utilized to carry out weighted temporal
summarization of connectivity matrix as
∑𝑇𝑡=1 𝒖3,1 (𝑡) 𝑾𝒔 (𝑡)
(3)
𝑾𝑠 =
,
∑𝑇𝑡=1 𝒖3,1 (𝑡)
where Ws ∈ ℝ𝑁×𝑁 is the static connectivity matrix of subject
‘s’. Similarly, the summarization was done for all subjects to
obtain S number of 𝑁 × 𝑁 connectivity matrices.

C. Subject summarization for extracting group-level
functional connectivity
To study group-level FC, connectivity matrices of all S
subjects of a particular group (say ID) were stacked together to
create a 3D tensor W of size 𝑁 × 𝑁 × 𝑆. Similar to the process
explained above, subject summarization was carried out after
HoSVD [34]. Compared to simple averaging of the connectivity
matrices of all subjects, HoSVD based subject summarization
accounts for inter-subject variability and carries out weighted
summarization. This led to the formation of static group-level
adjacency matrix of size 𝑁 × 𝑁.
D. Binary graph generation
The subject summarized-weighted 2D adjacency matrix is
binarized by applying a threshold to select only the significant
connections. Top 30% connections were considered significant
and an absolute threshold value was determined for the same.
PC values in the connectivity matrix exceeding the threshold
were set to ‘1’ and rest were set to ‘0’. This resulted in the
formation of a binary connection matrix, where a connection or
an edge between two nodes exist, if the corresponding entry in
the binary connection matrix is ‘1’; otherwise, there is no edge
between them.
E. Graph theoretical metrics
Next, graph metrics were computed from the binary
connection matrix of size 𝑁 × 𝑁. The network was explored
visually. Functional brain networks as well as network metrics
were extracted in Gephi [35]. Louvain modularity algorithm
with randomized experiments was used to extract unweighted
and undirected communities or networks [36]. The quality of
partition 𝑃 was quantified using the modularity index 𝑄 as
1

𝑘𝑘

𝑖 𝑗
𝑄 = 2𝑚 ∑𝑐∈𝑃 ∑𝑖,𝑗∈𝑁[𝑨𝑖𝑗 − 2𝑚
],
(4)
where ‘m’ is the total number of edges, A is the adjacency
matrix of the network, ki is the degree of the node ‘i’. The index
𝑐 runs over the modules of partition 𝑃, while the indices ‘i’ and
‘j’ span across the 𝑁 nodes of the matrix. Louvain algorithm
assigns a modularity class to each node. Networks possessing
high modularity can be interpreted as having high intercommunity connections and sparse intra-community
connections. It is considered to be the best measure of
determining quality of partition 𝑃 of a network.
We also explored graph theory metric, namely, clustering
coefficient that is considered to be a useful measure to quantify
function-structure associations in the brain and helps in the
understanding of small-worldness of a network, its community
structure and its local efficiency [37]. It is a popular measure
for studying functional segregation across different
communities and functional aggregation within a community of
brain. For example, it measures how likely it is that the two
connected nodes are part of a larger highly connected group or
degree to which nodes in a network tend to cluster. To quantify
this tendency, clustering coefficient was introduced [38]. There
are two types of clustering coefficients, local clustering
coefficient (LCC) and global clustering coefficient (GCC).
LCC is computed for all the nodes in the network and provides
the fraction of nodes that are connected to each other. LCC

considers local connectivity pattern, while GCC is computed
for the entire network and provides average neighborhood
connectivity for the entire network. GCC can be computed by
two approaches, first by computing the average of LCC over all
the nodes. The second approach for computing GCC is by
measuring the transitivity of the network, which is the ratio of
number of triangles and number of open triads in a network as
GCC2=3×

∑ τΔ
No. of triangles
=
∑τ
No. of open triads

(5)

where ∑ 𝜏 gives the total number of open triads and ∑ 𝜏𝛥 is the
subset of these open triads which are triangles. The value of this
coefficient ranges between ‘0’ and ‘1’. Both the approaches to
compute GCC, either by GCC1 or by GCC2, measure the
tendency of edges to form triangles. GCC2 places larger weight
on high degree nodes as compared to GCC1, which can be really
useful while studying brain networks.
One of the objectives of the study was to understand whether
GCC is a suitable measure to detect group-related differences
between TDC and ID groups. Additionally, it was desired to
explore as to which of the two approaches of computing GCC
is more relevant for such studies. To this end, the 3D tensor of
filtered EEG data of dimension 𝑁 × 𝐿 × 𝑇 × 𝑆 was converted
into a 4D tensor of dimension 𝑁 × 𝑁 × 𝑇 × 𝑆, containing the
𝑁 × 𝑁 connectivity matrices (generated using functional
connectivity measure), for all the time windows 𝑇 and for all
the subjects 𝑆. This 4D tensor was then subject-summarized and
binarized into a 3D tensor of dimension 𝑁 × 𝑁 × 𝑇, for which
the GCC values were computed using both the approaches, to
study the evolution of modules and clusters over a period of
time. GCC1 and GCC2 were computed using the Brain
Connectivity Toolbox (BCT) [39] over the binary undirected
adjacency matrices of dimension 𝑁 × 𝑁 for all time windows.
F. Statistical analysis
Brain network analyses and neuroimaging studies have taken
a transcendental leap over the past couple of decades. However,
for statistical measures, researchers usually resort to common
statistical tests that rely on network metric and univariate nodal
or edge-based comparisons that ignore the inherent topological
properties of the network. This study carries out statistical
testing by two methods. The first method is the conventional
univariate statistical comparison of results by the nonparametric two-sample t-test, i.e., the Wilcoxon rank sum test
that does not assume known distributions. This test returns a
decision for the null hypothesis that data in two samples are
from continuous distributions with equal medians, against the
alternative that they are not. This statistical test was applied on
the GCC values to examine if GCC values were statistically
significantly different in the two groups TDC and ID for both
rest and music state. Results from this test provided statistical
support for the cognitive and theoretic findings of this work.
Inspired from the permutation testing framework of Simpson
et al. [25], this work proposed to statistically test the clustering
strength of networks of ID and TDC groups via permutation
testing. In permutation testing, the distribution of test statistic
under the null hypothesis is generated empirically from the data
by permuting data labels. Analysis of GCC, which is the degree

to which nodes in a graph tend to form a cluster, provided an
insight of the regions of activity in the brain and thus, of the
functional brain networks.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. ID and TDC Group-level Network analysis
The inter-group differences between TDC and ID population
was studied from the perspective of network analysis and
cognitive reasonings associated with nodal properties of the
network. A total of four networks were generated for grouplevel analysis for rest and music states of ID and TDC groups.
After the binarization of adjacency matrix to ‘0’ and ‘1’ as
described earlier in Section III-D, some nodes were not
observed to have connection with any other node and hence,
were not available in the final networks (missing nodes). Also,
diagonals of the adjacency matrix that denote the connection of
a node to itself (self-loop) were not considered.
The fBNs generated for group level analysis of the TDC
group, for both rest and music state are depicted in Fig. 3 and
Fig. 4. Among a wide array of inter-nodal connections, three
network communities were found in both rest and music state
albeit with subtle differences in their formation in respective
states. The predominance of nodes with respect to their nodal
connections was, however, majorly changed while still
remaining in the similar network formation in both states.

(BA09), FC5 (BA44), T8 (BA21) and F7 (BA45 and BA47)
with a predominant connectivity at AF3 and FC5 nodes. The
second community of nodes had F3 (BA08), F8 (BA45 and
BA47), FC6 (BA06) and P7 (BA19 and BA37) with
predominant connectivity at F3 and F8 nodes. The third
community of nodes had F4 (BA08), AF4 (BA09), P8 (BA19
and BA37), O1 (BA18) and O2 (BA18) with predominant
connectivity at F4 and O2 nodes. During the music state, three
slightly different network communities were observed for TDC
group. The first community of nodes had AF3 (BA09), FC6
(BA06) and F7 (BA45 and BA47) with a predominant
connectivity at AF3 node. The second community of nodes had
F3 (BA08), F8 (BA45 and BA47), FC5 (BA44), T7 (BA21) and
T8 (BA21). The third community of nodes had F4 (BA08), AF4
(BA09), P7 (BA19 and BA37), O1 (BA18) and O2 (BA18) with
a predominant connectivity at AF4, O1 and O2 nodes.

nodes that are considered relevant for secondary motor
response, motor planning, imaging and learning, auditory
imagery, working memory and visuo-motor response. Such
strong frontal behaviour of this community can be explained by
subject’s engagement in working memory, memory retrieval
and mental imaging which happens during the rest state, when
the mind is engaged in random thought processes. Negligible

activation on temporal sites can be explained by no auditory
stimulus and complete silence during the rest state. But during
the music state, temporal cortex had activated to significant
proportions. Such strong temporal behaviour of this community
can be explained by the auditory stimulus provided to the
subjects, which resulted in significant activation at temporal
sites. During the music state, temporal nodes had increased
connections to the respective ipsilateral frontal regions with
increased connectivity at the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(AF3 and AF4), which is a major seat for language
comprehension and expression, working memory, memory
retrieval and encoding, selective attention to sounds, executive
planning, auditory imagery and emotional stimuli. This could
reflect the activation of fronto-temporal circuitry during music
perception.
The interconnection of nodes was not just lateralized to a
hemisphere, but had inter-hemispheric connections too. This
implies the importance of interhemispheric neurons forming
communications with different cortical areas. The presence of
distinct occipito-parietal network in both states further validates
the presence of different networks observed in the current
study. The activation of occipital network can be due to visual
mental imaging that goes on while at rest with closed eyes and
can be explained by subject’s engagement in semantic
processing and memory recalling due to the given auditory
stimulus in music state. It was also observed that networks were
more intermingled at rest but became slightly more distinctive
but yet incorporated with music.
From the above network analysis of TDC group for both rest
and music state, we can conclude that the generated functional
networks are consistent in nature, as their network properties
stand in complete correlation not only with the cognitive
reasoning suggested by related literature but also with the
experimental design. Moreover, this conclusion also validates
the efficiency of the 14-electrode wireless EEG device in
recording electrophysiological brain activity, which can be used
to generate consistent functional brain networks.
After validating the recording device and establishing the
consistency of generated functional brain network, the
functional networks generated for group-level analysis of the
ID group for both rest and music state were explored. The
functional networks generated for group level analysis of the ID
group for both rest and music states are depicted in Fig. 5 and
Fig. 6, respectively. Among a wide array of inter-nodal
connections, two network communities were found in the rest
state, while four communities were found in the music state.
During the rest state, the first community of nodes had AF3
(BA09), AF4 (BA09), FC5 (BA44), F4 (BA08), P7 (BA19 and
BA37), P8 (BA19 and BA37), F7 (BA45 and BA47), T8
(BA21), O1 (BA18) and O2 (BA18) with a predominant
connectivity at AF4 and P8 nodes. The second community of
nodes had F3 (BA08), F8 (BA45 and BA47), FC5 (BA44), FC6
(BA06) and T7 (BA21) with predominant connectivity at F3
node. The internodal connection was observed to be sparse in
ID group as compared to the TDC group during rest state
suggesting poorer inter- and intra-hemispheric connection in ID
group. Overall, during the rest state, there was a dominance of

parietal activity of the dominant hemisphere in ID group in
comparison to the bilateral frontal dominance as seen in TDC
group suggesting poorer attention and lesser involvement in
executive planning in ID group participants.
During the music state, four network communities were
observed for ID group. The first community of nodes had AF3
(BA09), AF4 (BA09), FC5 (BA44) and O2 (BA18) with
predominant connectivity of FC5 node. The second community
of nodes had FC6 (BA06) and O1 (BA18) with predominant
connectivity of FC6 node. The third community of nodes had
P8 (BA19 and BA37), F3 (BA08) and T7 (BA21) with
predominant connectivity of P8 node. The fourth network was
composed of F4 (BA08), F7 (BA45 and BA47), F8 (BA45 and
BA47), P7 (BA19 and BA37) and T8 (BA21) with predominant
connectivity of T8, F7 and F8 nodes. Segregation of networks
in music state in comparison to rest state networks suggests that
parallel circuits are formed when stimuli such as music is
provided to ID participants. This may reflect poorer integration
of cortical circuitry requiring more neuronal efforts for the
processing of audio stimuli. There was a predominance of P8
connections (representing the inferior temporal gyrus of
dominant hemisphere) in both music and rest states in ID group
participants suggests more importance is provided to
environmental structures such as face and body recognition.
The enhanced activity at temporal regions (T8 more than T7)
during the music state could be understood in the context of
their involvement in the perception of auditory stimuli during
listening music.
During the music state, the predominance of frontal
connections was not observed in ID group as in the TDC group.
Rather, an overall predominance was observed at the temporoparietal region. Also, the ID group lacked in the activation of
the predominant fronto-temporal circuits as observed in the
TDC group during the music state. Moreover, unlike the
distinctive activity at the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex circuitry
in TDC group, the participants in the ID group displayed poorer
involvement of this region reflecting lesser involvement in
executive processing of music. The predominant connections of
T8 to F7 and F8 and belonging to a separate network further
suggests music enjoyment rather than appropriate audio
processing of the stimuli in context of executive functioning.
The separate occipito-parietal community network observed in
TDC group was not observed in ID group in either state
supporting poorer networking circuits in these groups of
participants.
With the above network analysis, it was concluded that the
generated functional networks were consistent with reference to
the cognitive reasonings associated with the structural property
of networks.
B. Statistical analysis of network parameter
In general, it is known that there is less coordination between
brain regions in NDD. This study attempted to validate this via
statistical analysis of the GCC as a network parameter. Results
of Wilcoxon ranksum test suggested the following: 1) for GCC1, significant differences were observed between TDC and ID
classes in the rest state (p=3.29e-51, Table S2) and, between
TDC and ID classes in the music state (p=7.84e-106, Table S2),

2) for GCC-2, again significant differences were observed
between TDC and ID classes in the rest state (p=3.10E-86,
Table S2) and, between TDC and ID classes in the music state
(p=1.88e-184, Table S2) and, 3) much lower p-values were
observed while using GCC-2 as a parameter compared to GCC1, indicating that GCC-2 is a better measure of the two because
it is more efficient in capturing differences between the two
groups in group-level analysis.
Apart from comparing the two groups in rest and music
states, data from rest and music states of both the groups were
also analyzed vis-à-vis each other. Results suggested the
following: 1) for GCC-1, no significant differences were
observed between rest and music classes for the TDC group
(p=0.0422, Table S3) and, rest and music classes for the ID
group (p=0.1232, Table S3), 2) for GCC-2, again no significant
differences were observed between rest and music classes for
TDC group (p=0.0237, Table S3) and, rest and music classes
for ID group (p=0.0231, Table S3). Fig. 7 and 8 depict boxplots
for the visual comparison of the two groups for both GCC-1 and
GCC-2 values in rest and music states from which it was
concluded that the two groups are indeed different.

9) and GCC-2 was computed as the test statistic for all the
subjects in G1 and G2 groups. Next, ratio of mean of GCC-2
values of G1 to that of G2, denoted by R gcc, was computed as
depicted in Fig. 9.

Fig. 9. Figure shows labels of two groups G1 and G2, each with 7 subjects.
Left: depicts the original labelling of subjects and Right: depicts one example
of permuted labelling of subjects

This Rgcc value corresponds to the original label. The labels
were then permuted (randomly shuffled) and the R gcc values
were again computed for all the set of combinations, resulting
in K number of Rgcc values, where K is the number of times
labels were permuted. After generating K number of R gcc
values, their histogram was plotted to see the empirical
distribution. If the R gcc value computed using the original labels
lies beyond 0.05 or lesser probability region of the empirical
distribution generated using permutation testing framework, it
is said to be significant.
The permutations were done 300,000 times and the empirical
distribution of R gcc values was plotted for the music state data
of both the groups. Fig. 10 depicts this distribution and also the
position of Rgcc value calculated using the original labels i.e.
observed Rgcc. From this figure, it was concluded that the
functional brain networks of the two groups under study, i.e.,
the TDC and ID groups, for music state data, were indeed
statistically different. Similar procedure was repeated on the
rest data. Fig. 11 depicts this distribution and also the position
of the R gcc value calculated using the original labels.

C. Permutation testing framework
In the proposed permutation-testing framework, GCC
through transitivity measure (GCC-2) was used as the test
statistic. This study had seven subjects in the ID group (G1) and
ten subjects in the TDC group (G2). For the sake of uniformity
in the number of subjects considered, 7 subjects from the TDC
group were randomly selected. First, subjects in the dataset
were assigned an ‘id’ called as the original label (refer to Fig.

Fig. 10. Empirical distribution generated by permutation for GCC analysis on
the music state data of both the groups

This figure demonstrates that the functional brain networks
of the two groups under study i.e. the TDC and the ID groups,
for rest state data, are indeed statistically different. Also, the
lower GCC values for ID population suggests that, perhaps,

these subjects have lesser coordination or connectivity strength
within their networks. Overall, the functional brain networks of
both the groups are statistically different.

the rest state data of both the groups

V. CONCLUSION
This study has made some important contributions. First, the
data of ID subjects was captured using 14-channel dry electrode
EEG system. Although multiple channel wet electrode EEG
systems are considered more reliable compared to the dry
electrode systems with limited channels, it was worthwhile to
test dry electrode system in this study because ID subjects
accepted this headset as a playful device and hence, captured
data was reliable as proved via statistical analysis as well as via
cognitive corroborations of the extracted networks. Since, in
general, these subjects do not accept any device or equipment
easily, particularly, the gel-based wet electrode system could
have disturbed their natural brain response because of anxiety
and discomfort. Thus, this study establishes the utility of dry
electrode based limited channel EEG devices that can make
data collection and analysis of EEG related studies much easier
on the ID population.
Second, this work studied functional brain networks formed
during the music and rest states of human brain using tensorbased signal processing framework. The task or activity specific
functional brain network and functional connectivity of subjects
were successfully extracted from their EEG recordings.
Distinctions were observed between the rest and music states of
the brain by two major analyses, namely, network analysis and
network parameter analysis. In the network analysis, the
associated BAs and their cognitive functionalities were utilized
to reason out the resulting networks. Overall, lesser brain
activation was observed in ID group as compared to TDC
group, reflecting lesser involvement in executive processing of
the task. However, improvement in activation by a cognitive
training exercise can presumably help in improving their mental
functioning depending on the focus of the cognitive training.
This may also be reflective of the benefits observed in
population of individuals with traumatic brain injury receiving
specific cognitive training for improving a particular cognitive
deficit.
Third, in the network parameter analysis, GCC, a network

parameter was studied extensively. This parameter analysis was
based on the hypothesis that although brain of ID subjects
perceives stimuli and show activations, the intra-community
strength may be lower in ID population. Indeed, this was
observed through the permutation testing framework that was
extended to GCC coefficient in this work. Overall, three
statistical measures, namely ranksum test, boxplots, and a novel
approach of permutation testing framework were utilized to
establish the differences in the networks in music versus rest
states as well as in ID versus TDC population.
Fourth, the insignificant differences within the groups in
music vs. rest states suggests that the preservation of the
functional circuits remains more or less intact within the healthy
or ID population. However, there is an altered network
architecture in different population groups as suggested by the
observed group differences. Furthermore, functional networks
suggested differential activation of networks during the rest and
music states among the groups suggesting poorer attention and
lesser involvement in executive planning along with poorer
integration of cortical circuitry requiring more neuronal efforts
in ID group participants. This may explain the cognitive deficits
and associated social impairment observed in such individuals.
In future, researchers should focus on identifying responses
to different varieties of environmental stimulation in this
population to gather more information regarding the brain
networks. The information can then be utilized in developing
programs to foster targeted intervention towards environmental
manipulation of various stimuli to bolster cognitive
rehabilitation in ID population. Specifically, from a practical
perspective, training modules focused on strengthening the
neural networks of task-associated learning can also help in
building the abilities in the ID population. It has been found that
task-specific functioning can be strengthened by utilizing
neuro-modulation techniques such as transcranial direct current
stimulation (tDCS), applied while performing a cognitive task.
Motivated with the above, this study suggests to devise
interventions utilizing the methods and finding of this work
along with the tDCS based design to help ID individuals facing
challenges in translating the required actions like performing a
task while listening to the instructions simultaneously. A
similar strategy can be applicable in this population group to
understand how instruction-linked brain activation becomes a
helping factor for quick motor-sensory response for the task.
