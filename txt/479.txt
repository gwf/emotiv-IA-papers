Abstract- This paper investigates the use of LDA algorithm In the EEG classification. EEG feature extraction is
Implemented to reduce the dimensionality of data. The Sliding Window Technique is used to calculate the mean
within each window samples. Then, classification is done based on hyperplane technique. The LDA algorithm is
described in details with all the implementation Issues. The LDA regularization is also discussed and its effects on
the classification accuracy is given. In addition, both window size and channel selection effect on the accuracy is
Illustrated. Results show that a window size of 150 samples, channel 3 and regularization parameter of 0.9 gives
an accuracy of 90%.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In the last two decades, the research focus on Brain- Computer Interface (BCI) applications has been increased. A BCI
application is defined as the action of recording the Electroencephalography (EEG) activity of the brain. Then, the recorded
data is filtered from noise, features are extracted and classified to perform a predefined action (such as opening or closing
an artificial arm) [1]. Since the EEG data is large (1 sec of EEG data can have up to 256 time samples), feature extraction
is needed, which is the first phase of the EEG classifier. Feature extraction is mandatory because most classifiers include
matrix operations, and when a matrix is large in size, it is called an ill-conditioned matrix. The inverse of such matrices
includes large numerical errors. Therefore, reducing the data size is needed. Usually, common EEG features are extracted
in time or frequency bands. The second step of the classifier includes two phases: training and recognition. In the training
phase, EEG data sets of known classes are used to train the classification algorithm offline. Then, the unclassified EEG
data is fed to the classifier and a decision is made (determining which class the EEG samples belong to). The classification
decision is then fed to the implemented hardware and the required action is done (moving an artificial arm or driving a
wheelchair). Many feature reduction and classification techniques have been considered with EEG based Motor Imagery
(MI) applications. Several feature extraction techniques have been considered in the literature [2] :
1) time features.
2) spectrum energy features.
3) statistical features.
Time features can be extracted by many approaches, most commonly used are: Eigen Value Decomposition (EVD),
Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
Because BCI applications requires real- time or semi real- time approaches, time features are the best candidate regarding
computation time and complexity, compared to other feature extraction approaches. Many researchers investigated the use
of different feature extraction and they showed promising results. [3] used PCA as feature reduction and Support Vector
Machine (SVM) as a classifier, to reach an accuracy of 97.5%. [4] discussed the small size problem of the feature matrix,

for which the number of time features is largely higher than the number of channels. It reaches an accuracy of 84% for twoclass problem. [5] used Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) filtering along with LDA to reach a maximum accuracy of 99%. [6]
showed that xDAWN algorithm accuracy outperforms both ICA and PCA. [7] and [8] demonstrated an accuracy comparison
between different spectral feature extraction techniques, including Power Spectral Density (PSD), time-frequency energy
distributions, periodogram, Spectrogram and Morlet Wavelet features. In this work, an offline EEG-MI classifier is built
based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). It includes both steps mentioned above: feature extraction and classification.
This work focuses on all implementation issues of the LDA classifier as well as the related theoretical background. The
paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the LDA feature extraction is described. Then, in Section III the limitations
of LDA are discussed with proposed solutions. The LDA classification algorithm is described in details. In Section IV, the
setup procedure as well as the recording process is described. The algorithm parameters are varied and the corresponding
accuracy are shown in figures.
II. LDA F EATURE E XTRACTION
Since the EEG signal time samples show no obvious difference between different MI commands, it is not possible to
use classification directly on time samples. Fig. 1 depicts EEG time samples for two classes. It can be seen that there is no
obvious classification pattern between the two classes. Therefore, feature extraction is needed, on which the classification
accuracy relies on.

In this paper, LDA feature extraction is used because it introduces good separability between different EEG classes
and hence simple linear classifier can be used. Before being able to use time features in LDA, it is mandatory to reduce
the feature size. This is attained using sliding window technique (SWT). That is, for a single trial vector, the mean is
calculated for 300 sample and a single mean value is stored. The operation is repeated for the next group of samples.

As a result, a single command trial of 640 samples (5 seconds) can be represented by just 5 features (instead of 640),
resulting in more accurate feature representation and non- singular matrix operations. The concept of the SWT is described
as follows: Since the EEG data is stationary within the window, therefore, the single mean value of the window is sufficient
to express all time features within that window. Sometimes, Root Mean Square (RMS) value is used instead. In order to
be able to extract features from EEG time samples, dimensioality reduction is needed. It removes redundant features by
transforming from higher order to lower order space, allowing matrix manipulation operations to be performed more easily.
Many dimensionality reduction techniques exist, such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Non- negative Matrix
Factorization (NMF), Mixture Discriminant Analysis (MDA), and LDA. The latter is the most used approach [2]. This
technique maximizes the between-class variance (dissimilarity between classes) and minimizes the within-class variance
(dissimilarity within the same class). As a result, maximum separation between two classes is achieved. This separation
is performed on the EEG features from both classes (Class 0 and Class 1) and saved as Training Features. New extracted
features (unclassified) are projected against the training features. The classification is done by assigning the class that gives
the minimum distance (least error) to either Class 0 or Class 1 features. The schematic flow chart of LDA is illustrated in
Fig. 2.

III. L INEAR D ISCRIMINANT A NALYSIS A LGORITHM
LDA can be described as a projection of the EEG window time samples onto a lower dimensional space [9]. This
projection maximizes the distance between the two classes and therefore a correct classification can be made. In order to
describe LDA algorithm, the following assumptions about data samples are made. Each trial EEG data samples are stored
as a matrix X (ch, t) = {x1 , x2 , ..., xT }, where the rows M are the channels and the columns T are the time samples:


x1 , 1 x1 , 2 .... x1 , T


xM , 1 xM , 2 .... xM , T
As mentioned in Section II, data reduction must be conducted on the time samples. Using a sliding window of size t, the
mean of each t samples is calculated and stored in a new matrix Y (ch, t) = {y1 , y2 , ..., yI}. Therefore, a total of I features
for each channel is extracted, where I < T :


(2)

for a single channel LDA approach, the matrix Y (ch, t) is reduced to a vector y(t) = y1 , y2 , ..., yI .
The next step of feature extraction is to stack the row features of each EEG trial into a column vector. This step results in
matrix Fi (t, n) = {f 1, f 2, ..., f N }, where N is the number

After feature extraction, the LDA algorithm is applied on the extracted feature matrices of both classes. LDA can be
summarized in three basic steps:
1) Between- Class Variance, SBi . It represents the distance between the projection of the mean of classi , µi , and the
total mean, µT . The mean µi of all trails of class is calculated as follows:
1 X
µi =
Fi (t, n)
N n

and the total mean:

µT =

whereµi , µT <I, Therefore, SBi is calculated as:
T

SBi = Ni (µi − µT ) (µi − µT )

where Ni is the total number of trials in classi . The total Between- Class Variance, SBT , is then calculated as:
SBT =

2) Within- Class Variance, SW i . It represents the difference between the features of classi , Fi , and the mean of classi , µi .
SW i is calculated as:
Swi = (Fi − µi ) (Fi − µi )

T

and the total Within- Class Variance,SW T is calculated as:

SW T =

3) Lower dimensional space projection. LDA algorithm searches for a solution that maximizes the total Between-Class
Variance, SBT . Hence, the separation distance between classes is increased. In addition, it tries to minimize the
Within- Class Variance SW T . This optimization problem is called Fisher’s criterion, described in Eq. 10
J (W ) = arg max
W

W T SBT W
W T SW T W

(10)

A solution to maximize the objective function J(W) is formulated as:
SW T W = λSBT W

(11)

where λ are the Eigen values of the projection matrix W . Then:
−1
W = SW
T SBT

(12)

After sorting the Eigen vectors in a decreasing order, according to λ, the largest Eigen vector, V is selected. The LDA
hyperplane, used to classify EEG features is formulated as [10]:
a = V · µT

(13)

b = −aT µT

(14)

where a is a vector and b is a scaler. The classification step is simply done by evaluating the sign of the scalar variable
Class in Eq. 15 for each of the input feature vectors Fj . If the sign is positive, it is assigned to class- 1, otherwise, class0 is chosen.
Class = sign aT Fj + b

LDA suffers from two problems, the first one is called Small Sample Size (SSS), in which the number of samples is
smaller than the dimensions. The second problem arises when the two classes are not linearly separable, that is, the mean
of the two classes is approximately equal. The solution to the nonlinearity problem is done by mapping the samples into
a newer space using a Radial Basis Function (RBF). Example is Gaussian RBF, defined as:


2
K (xi , xj ) = exp − kxi − xj k /2σ 2

(16)

For the SSS problem, the identity matrix is multiplied by a regularization parameter η. The result is then added to the
within-class matrix, SW T , to become non- singular:
SW T = (1 − η) SW T + η

Tr(SW T )
ΓM
M

(17)

where M is the size of the squared SW T matrix.
LDA algorithm is summarized as follows:
1) Read EEG time samples (10trials × 640samples) (Eq. 1)
2) Feature extraction: for each trial(i):
•

Calculate mean of samples in window (Eq. 4)

•

Store in new matrix (Eq. 2), Each Class- 0 and Class- 1 are matrices (10 trials × 6 time features)

3) Apply steps (2- 3) to test trials (test trials are 10 trials × 6 features)
4) Transpose: stack each trail matrix into one column vector (Eq. 3)
5) Mean: for each class matrix, calculate mean (column- wise) (Eq. 4) and the total mean (Eq. 5)
6) Between Class Variance:
•

SBi (Eq. 6)

•

SBT (Eq. 7)

7) Within Class Variance:
•

Class- 0 Covariance Matrix (6 ∗ 6) (Eq. 8)

•

Class- 1 Covariance Matrix (6 ∗ 6) (Eq. 8)

•

Total Covariance Matrix (6 ∗ 6) (Eq. 9)

8) LDA Regularization (Eq. 17)
9) Calculate separating plan (Eq. 13)
10) Classification: For each trial(i)
•

Test = trial(i) (6 × 1)

•

polarity = sign (Eq. 15)

•

if polarity > 0 : class(i) = 1
else class(i) = 0

11) Calculate Accuracy.

IV. I MPLEMENTATION AND R ESULTS
The EEG dataset was collected using EMOTIV EPOC headset, which provides 14 channels. The subject was asked to
sit at rest state for 10 to 20 minutes prior to recording. This allows the relaxation of the brain activities in general and the
accuracy of recorded EEG data. The subject is then asked put both of his hands rest on a table in front of him, while his
eyes are opened. Then, a cue is shown to him to imagine the movement of his right hand (Close and Opening). While he
closes and opens his right hand repeatedly, the EEG data is recorded for 5 seconds at a rate of 128 samples per second.
Those trails are imported to MATLAB. Each trail consists of 640 samples. Trial recording is repeated until 10 trials are
recorded and stored. These trials are named as Class Right training. The same procedure is repeated for Class Left training
samples. MATLAB 2018a environment is used to record, store and implement the LDA algorithm. After the training data
is acquired, the features representing each class are extracted and stored as matrices. The subject then performed either
left- or right- hand simple movement (closing and opening of each hand) repeatedly for five seconds. The choice of which
hand to move is random. During the subject session, the EEG signal is recorded at a sampling rate of 128 samples per
second. This step is repeated for 20 trails with different random choices for either left or right hand of the subject. For
each trial, the LDA algorithm then extracts the features from the EEG data set and those features are compared against the
training features extracted during the training phase. According to the sign of Eq. 15, the winning class result is recorded.
The accuracy of the algorithm is calculated as:
Accuracy = no.of correctclassif ication/totalnumberof trials

(18)

As it can be seen from Fig. 3, the best channel accuracy occurs at channel 3, which complies with F3 sensor. This sensor
is the nearest to the MI region in the brain, related to EMOTIV EPOC headset (see Fig. 4). The regularization parameter
(η) selection plays a role in increasing the accuracy of the inverse of the matrix. Several values were tested for η against
accuracy, as shown in Fig. 5. The best accuracy occurs between [0.85, 0.9]. Fig. 6 shows the effect of windows size
(in samples) on the classification accuracy. It can be seen that a window size of approximately 1.2 seconds gives the
best accuracy. In another word, the mean value for every 150 samples represents certain EEG signal. On the other hand,
increasing the window size beyond 175 samples will decrease the accuracy. The reason for this accuracy degradation is
that larger window size will overlap with adjacent EEG samples, therefore, the unique time feature characteristics will be
destroyed. As a result, an EEG recording of 1.5 seconds is sufficient for LDA classification. Therefore, the user does not
have to repeat EEG emotion within a single trial.

V. C ONCLUSIONS
In this paper, EMOTIV EPOC headset is used to capture and store EEG data from brain. The EEG feature extraction
procedure is described. Then, LDA algorithm used in EEG classification is depicted in low- level details. This work covered
all the mathematical and programming implementation details of LDA, in both stages of extraction and clarification. In
addition, the ill-conditioned matrix problem and solution is described. It has been found that the classification accuracy is
maximum when channel three is selected. Moreover, the algorithm attains its best classification when the window size is
