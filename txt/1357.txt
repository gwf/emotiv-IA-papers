Abstract: This work used a low-cost wireless electroencephalography (EEG) headset to quantify the
human response to different cognitive stress states on a single-trial basis. We used a Stroop-type
color–word interference test to elicit mild stress responses in 18 subjects while recording scalp EEG.
Signals recorded from thirteen scalp locations were analyzed using an algorithm that computes
the root mean square voltages in the theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–13 Hz), and beta (13–30 Hz) bands
immediately following the initiation of Stroop stimuli; the mean of the Teager energy in each of these
three bands; and the wideband EEG signal line-length and number of peaks. These computational
features were extracted from the EEG signals on thirteen electrodes during each stimulus presentation
and used as inputs to logistic regression, quadratic discriminant analysis, and k-nearest neighbor
classifiers. Two complementary analysis methodologies indicated classification accuracies over
subjects of around 80% on a balanced dataset for the logistic regression classifier when information
from all electrodes was taken into account simultaneously. Additionally, we found evidence that stress
responses were preferentially time-locked to stimulus presentation, and that certain electrode–feature
combinations worked broadly well across subjects to distinguish stress states.

1. Introduction
This work examined the usefulness of scalp electroencephalography (EEG) recorded by
non-medical-grade equipment for discriminating cognitive stress states in human subjects. We used
a Stroop-type test [1,2] to induce stress, and then used computational EEG features in conjunction
with state-of-the-practice statistical learning methods to classify stress state on a single-trial basis.
The present study was an extension of our prior work [3] investigating the potential and limitations of
low-cost EEG headsets for classifying cognitive stress in non-clinical settings.
An extensive literature review exploring the definition of stress was presented by Staal [4].
In this review, the scientific community’s difficulty in finding a consensus definition of the stress
concept is acknowledged. Staal described the two traditional models for stress: stimulus-based and
response-based. The stimulus-based model defines stress as the application of certain conditions
(“stressors”) that disturb the “normal” functioning of an individual (e.g., time pressures, physical
discomfort, and excessive workload). The response-based model defines stress by the pattern of
responses (behavioral, cognitive, and affective) that result from exposure to a stressor. Neither model
has been found to be complete, and thus a third model has emerged which describes stress as “the result
of a mismatch between individuals’ perceptions of the demands of the task and their perceptions of
the resources for coping with them” [5]. Staal also explored the similarities and differences between

stress and mental workload. He described that, while increased mental workload may be a stressor
(i.e., a stimulus that induces a physiological stress response), it does not always induce stress. A critical
factor is whether the mental workload increases beyond an individual’s comfort level or ability.
Therefore, whether a certain mental workload level induces stress is often related to the level of
experience an individual has in executing a particular task. Furthermore, stressful stimuli and states
need not be accompanied by high mental workload [5].
More specifically, research on non-invasively quantifying human stress has emphasized the
use of several different physiological measurements such as blood volume pulse, galvanic skin
response, pupil diameter, and skin temperature, as well as clinical-grade scalp electroencephalography
(EEG) [6,7]. Variations in these signals are well-known indicators of sympathetic nervous system
responses to cognitive stress [8]. The related field of mental workload analysis has produced a large
literature specifically focused on classification problems [9–11], and new approaches for improving
classifier performance are the aim of many recent studies in this area. Roy et al. [12] compared mental
workload classification performance using spectral features extracted from raw EEG to performance
using task-independent spatially-filtered event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited in a reportedly
minimally intrusive manner. They relied upon a visual ERP evoked by an exogenous probe stimulus
(an image of a shape) that is distinct from the experimental stimulus (an image of a number) they
used to cue recall in a number-list memorization task. They concluded that ERPs yielded a better
performance (91% accuracy) when compared with spectral markers (60%). This is an encouraging
result, but one whose practical application is limited to scenarios in which the introduction of an
exogenous visual probe is both feasible and non-disruptive.
In addition to studying EEG feature selection, researchers have also addressed the unique
challenges associated with classifying workload in minimally constrained scenarios. For example,
Zarjam et al. [13] aimed to assess working memory load in a manner that did not require active
user participation, in real-time, ruling out the inclusion of ERPs in their experimental design.
They extracted entropy, energy, and wavelet coefficient-based features from EEG signals, and achieved
high classification accuracy, including subject-independent multi-channel classification that was stable
over time. Schultze-Kraft et al. [14] explored unsupervised learning approaches for handling missing
or noisy data labels. They leveraged cross-frequency power correlations to classify different states of
workload with a mean accuracy of 82%, noting that classifier performance was improved when EEG
data were augmented with peripheral physiological measures.
Raduntz et al. [15] sought to overcome the need to retrain a classifier upon the introduction of
new subjects and/or tasks. They used dual-frequency head maps on at least 54 subjects and three
different workload conditions to train a static support-vector machine (SVM) classifier using frequency
spectrum-based features. They demonstrated that a general increase in frontal theta power and a
decrease in parietal alpha power differentiated between workload conditions. The performance in
classifying workload states of new subjects and/or tasks was sufficient without retraining.
Whether successes in classifying mental workload using EEG translate naturally to discriminating
differences in cognitive stress states remains an open question. Addressing the difference between
workload and stress, Gaillard [5] concluded that high workload may but does not always induce stress.
Staal [4] provided evidence that the Stroop test, in particular, has been successfully employed as a
stimulus that puts subjects under cognitive stress, allowing researchers to measure the downstream
effects on cognition.
Some past studies have induced stress using Stroop or Stroop-type (hereafter, both referred to as
“Stroop” for simplicity) tests and then quantified it using non-EEG physiological measurements [1].
Others have employed Stroop tasks while recording EEG but primarily analyzed the data to draw
conclusions about the effects of stress on cognition rather than using EEG features to distinguish
different stress states. Astolfi et al. [16] used a Stroop task as a stimulus to look for an indirect
measurement of cortical connectivity. Schack et al. [17] analyzed real-time EEG coherence in a Stroop
paradigm to observe the evolution cortical connectivity measures. Atchley et al. [18] used only the

performance accuracies. They concluded that the Emotiv Epoc system is a low-cost mobile EEG data
acquisition system that is effective for their application.
In the present study, we combined the Emotiv Epoc system with BCI2000, a brain–computer
interfacing software package that we used for signal acquisition and stimulus delivery.
Custom MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) scripts were developed for all analyses.
Our experimental design and a subset of results reported in Section 3.1 and 3.2 were originally
described in [3]. These initial results are expanded upon in this work.
2. Materials and Methods
This within-subjects experimental study was conducted at the US Naval Academy, USA. It was
conducted in conformance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of the US Naval Academy (Human Research Protection Program approval
#2012.0024-IR-EP7-A) and informed consent was obtained from study participants.
2.1. Experimental Task
We used a Stroop color–word interference test [2] to elicit mild stress responses in 18 college-aged
male subjects. The test involves displaying the text string of a color–word, such as “blue," and
rendering it in a font color that either matches or does not match its definition. Subjects are tasked with
indicating the font color of the word via keypress (Sichel and Chandler [2] used a verbal response).
Incongruent Stroop stimuli such as the latter are well established as cognitive stressors that induce
emotional responses and heightened levels of physiological reactivity [1].
2.2. Data Collection
Subjects took a computer-based version of the Stroop test while their neural signals were recorded
by the Epoc EEG headset and their reaction times (i.e., time between the initial appearance of the
color–word on the screen and the initiation of their response) were logged. The computerized Stroop
test was developed using BCI2000’s “Stimulus Presentation Module,” which is designed to present a
sequence of visual and/or auditory stimuli to a subject [7]. Visual stimuli (color–words) were created
in Microsoft Paint and imported into the Stimulus Presentation Module. Each subject participated
in 10 experimental sessions: 5 “congruent” sessions, in which the font color and word matched,
and 5 “incongruent” sessions, in which they did not. A session consisted of 24 trials, each comprised of
a color–word stimulus lasting 1 s coupled with a blank screen period (i.e., the inter-stimulus interval)
of session type-dependent duration (see Table 1). Because previous work indicated that adding pacing
to the Stroop test might intensify physiological responses [1], inter-stimulus intervals were set such
that all trials expired within 1 s of the disappearance of the color–word stimulus, and intervals between
incongruent stimuli were varied uniformly randomly between 0.5 and 1 s. If subjects did not respond to
each stimulus within the allotted time, the screen automatically updated to the next trial. Table 1 gives
parameter values used for stimulus delivery in the congruent and incongruent sessions.

To examine the potential influence of time-trends in the EEG signal unrelated to the heightened
stress induced by color–word incongruence, we also built null classifiers that attempted to discriminate
early (the first 12) from late (the last 12) segments in each congruent session. We then compared the
performance of these null classifiers with our stress-state classifiers, as well as with chance classifiers
formed by randomly permuting the congruent and incongruent labels.
2.2.4. Fused Feature Classification
After considering the classification accuracy at each electrode individually, a natural question
was whether performance across subjects could be improved by using information from all electrodes
simultaneously. To test this idea, we formed 39-element feature vectors by fusing (concatenating) the
theta, alpha, and beta features from each of the 13 electrodes. To allow a more direct comparison
with the unfused feature case, we then used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) [31] to reduce
the dimensionality of these new feature vectors to 3, retaining on average 85.3% of the total data
variance in doing so. Reducing the size of the feature space in this way has the side benefit of lessening
computation time. It may also mitigate adverse impacts on performance associated with attempting
to learn decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces given our relatively small training set sizes
(n = 47 for LOOCV). However, we made no explicit attempt to optimize the number of features used.
We then trained and tested logistic regression, QDA, and 3-NN classifiers on the data using
leave-one-out cross-validation, performing the PCA step inside the cross-validation loop and mapping
test-points to the PCA space of the training data, paralleling the procedures used for the individual
electrode data.
2.2.5. Timing and Persistence of the Stress Response
We also investigated whether, during incongruent experimental sessions, the stress response was
globally heightened throughout the session or specifically locked to the delivery of the incongruent
stimuli. To test this, we extracted the same theta, alpha, and beta band features from the data, only now
locking analysis windows to randomly generated (i.e., spurious) stimulus delivery times rather than the
true delivery times of the color–word stimuli presented in each session. We then compared classification
results for this randomized case with those obtained using the true stimulus-delivery times.
2.2.6. Feature Analysis
Finally, we were interested in whether particular electrode–RMS feature combinations were
generally useful across subjects for discriminating between congruent and incongruent trials.
Toward this end, we compared the loadings of the first principal component among subjects.
Since the principal components are linear combinations of the original features, examining the relative
magnitudes of the elements of the first principal component loading vector—whose direction in feature
space is that along which the variance of the projected data is maximal—gives insight into which
electrode–RMS feature combinations may play strong (and weak) roles in distinguishing congruent
from incongruent trials.
2.2.7. Alternative Analysis Framework
As both a test of the robustness and an extension of the analytical procedures just described, we also
reconstituted every major analysis detailed above in Section 2 using an alternative framework that allowed
us to enlarge both our feature and training sets. In detail, we aggregated experimental sessions instead
of considering them in temporally corresponding pairs, in this case excluding the final congruent and
incongruent sessions (approximately the last two of about ten recorded minutes for each subject) to
mitigate the effects of task fatigue and adaptation. We then computed additional time-domain features
that are both common in the EEG signal processing literature and have shown promise in our previous
work in quantifying cognitive workload: EEG signal line length, number of peaks, and mean Teager
energy [11]. Specifically, we computed the following five additional features for every 1-s EEG segment

3.6. Alternative Analysis Framework
We found that the costs and benefits of the alternative analysis procedure described in Section 2.2.7.
were largely counterbalancing. Results were broadly consistent in trend between the two analysis
approaches, with the alternative framework yielding an approximately identical best performance for
the individual electrode analysis (70.8%) and a modest performance boost (81.1%) in the fused feature
analysis. There were also some expected differences: for example, a statistically insignificant shift in
the electrode showing the highest performance (T7 for the second analysis, as compared with Fc5 in
the first).
In general, the performance of 3-NN improved relative to the other two classifiers, likely
owing to a decrease in model variance accompanying the increased training set size. Still,
logistic regression remained the strongest performing classifier overall, with the highest accuracy
on a majority of electrodes for 13 of 18 subjects in the individual electrode analysis, and the
highest performing (including one tie) classifier for 11 of 18 subjects in the fused feature analysis.
The most notably different result between the analysis frameworks was for the timing experiment
described in Section 2.2.5: the differences in classification performance between the random and
stimulus-locked conditions visible in Figure 7 were not significant in the alternative analysis framework.
An effective signal-to-noise ratio enhancement brought about by increasing the number of features
with discriminatory power could account for this finding; increasing the number of features need not
have the same (or even any) impact on classification performance for both conditions.
Figures analogous to Figures 4–10, showing the main results of the alternative analysis framework,
are provided as Supplementary Materials (Figures S1–S7). Overall, the results of the two different
analysis procedures were remarkably similar, strengthening our conclusions.
4. Discussion
Our results demonstrate that, under controlled conditions, a portable, low cost-EEG headset can
be used to achieve good accuracy in distinguishing two different cognitive stress states on a single-trial
basis, using spectral features extracted from individual electrodes (70.7% mean across subjects for
electrode Fc5, for example). Furthermore, performance can be substantially enhanced (78.7%) by taking
advantage of the information on all electrodes simultaneously. We found accuracies greater than 90%
for 5/18 subjects using a logistic regression classifier with such a fused feature approach. Notably,
these results were obtained on a single trial basis using extremely small training sets: only 47 words
when corresponding congruent and incongruent sessions were combined. When we substantially
increased both the training set and the number of features used in classification, we saw a modest
boost in performance, to 81.1% accuracy in the fused feature case—in spite of the increase in training
set heterogeneity incurred by aggregating across experimental sessions. The exclusion of the final
congruent and incongruent sessions to mitigate the effects of task fatigue and adaptation in this
alternative analysis framework may have contributed to the observed performance boost. Our results
also suggest that the stress-state classifiers are to some degree leveraging time-trends in the EEG
signal unrelated to the heightened stress induced by color–word incongruence. If these time-trends are
unrelated to stress altogether, their presence could mean our results are optimistically biased. However,
they may also reflect a more interesting secondary stress response associated with within-session
fatigue. The inability to completely disentangle this issue is a limitation of our study design, which used
trial-homogenous sessions and did not independently measure another physiological variable, such as
galvanic skin response, that is correlated with stress-response. It would be interesting to explore
alternative experimental paradigms that would include the measurement of other physiological
variables and also might prospectively attempt to control for fatigue and/or measure it as part of
the procedure.
The differences we observed between stress states with a low-cost, consumer-grade device in
a non-clinical setting are consistent with previous work done in the field of stress quantification in
clinical settings [30], and our classification performance was reasonably comparable to, though lower

than, related work done with devices substantially more costly. For example, Schultze-Kraft et al. [14]
reported a classification accuracy of 90.4% when using a feature extraction approach similar to ours in a
cognitive workload study using the actiCAP System (BrainProducts GmbH, Germany), a clinical-grade
device that is an order of magnitude more expensive than the Emotiv Epoc.
In a comparative study, the Emotiv Epoc headset was shown to be influenced by movement
artifacts and yield EEG signals with signal-to-noise ratios that are poorer than a medical-grade
system [34]. In less motion-constrained studies than ours that may be severely impacted by eye and
other movement artifacts, some error sources can potentially be mitigated by applying established
artifact rejection techniques [35,36], although this can be challenging without the flexibility to place
additional reference signal electrodes offered by medical-grade devices. The analysis done here is
not conclusive with respect to the Emotiv Epoc’s ability to have application outside of controlled
laboratory environments. It also cannot address potential gender differences in neurophysiological
responses to stress, as our subject pool was comprised of only one gender.
The present study sought to provide a baseline analysis of two cognitive stress states, as induced
by incongruent and congruent color–word stimuli in a Stroop test paradigm, using a portable, wireless,
low-cost, consumer-grade EEG headset. Future research in this area will be aimed at studying whether
these positive results can be translated to non-laboratory environments and mobile environments,
and whether they can be used to establish a continuous measure of cognitive stress that can be tracked
in real time.
