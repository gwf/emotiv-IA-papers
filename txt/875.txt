Purpose: We aimed to develop a noninvasive neural test
of language comprehension to use with nonspeaking
children for whom standard behavioral testing is unreliable
(e.g., minimally verbal autism). Our aims were threefold.
First, we sought to establish the sensitivity of two auditory
paradigms to elicit neural responses in individual neurotypical
children. Second, we aimed to validate the use of a portable
and accessible electroencephalography (EEG) system,
by comparing its recordings to those of a researchgrade system. Third, in light of substantial interindividual
variability in individuals’ neural responses, we assessed
whether multivariate decoding methods could improve
sensitivity.
Method: We tested the sensitivity of two child-friendly covert
N400 paradigms. Thirty-one typically developing children
listened to identical spoken words that were either strongly
predicted by the preceding context or violated lexical–
semantic expectations. Context was given by a cue word
(Experiment 1) or sentence frame (Experiment 2), and
participants either made an overall judgment on word
relatedness or counted lexical–semantic violations. We
measured EEG concurrently from a research-grade system,
Neuroscan’s SynAmps2, and an adapted gaming system,
Emotiv’s EPOC+.

Results: We found substantial interindividual variability
in the timing and topology of N400-like effects. For both
paradigms and EEG systems, traditional N400 effects at
the expected sensors and time points were statistically
significant in around 50% of individuals. Using multivariate
analyses, detection rate increased to 88% of individuals
for the research-grade system in the sentences paradigm,
illustrating the robustness of this method in the face of
interindividual variations in topography.
Conclusions: There was large interindividual variability in
neural responses, suggesting interindividual variation in
either the cognitive response to lexical–semantic violations
and/or the neural substrate of that response. Around half
of our neurotypical participants showed the expected N400
effect at the expected location and time points. A low-cost,
accessible EEG system provided comparable data for
univariate analysis but was not well suited to multivariate
decoding. However, multivariate analyses with a researchgrade EEG system increased our detection rate to 88% of
individuals. This approach provides a strong foundation
to establish a neural index of language comprehension in
children with limited communication.

understand spoken language. Examples include disorders of
consciousness, minimally verbal autism, or cerebral palsy
(Giacino & Smart, 2007; Harrison & Connolly, 2013; TagerFlusberg & Kasari, 2013). In these cases, individuals may
score poorly on standardized or behavioral tests of language
despite intact language processing. For example, recent research on minimally verbal autistic children reports intact
neural markers of lexico-semantic processing despite an absence of spoken language (Cantiani et al., 2016; DiStefano
et al., 2019). This highlights the need for alternatives to
standard measures of receptive language. Such a method
could transform both individual assessment and treatment
and our scientific understanding of the cognitive profile of
these individuals.
Previous research has used indirect measures to investigate individual differences in language processing in neurotypical and clinical populations. For example, eye-tracking
has been used to study interindividual differences in word
processing (Farris-Trimble & McMurray, 2013). One commonly used eye-tracking paradigm, preferential-looking tasks,
consists of presenting participants with a spoken word and
two visual displays, one of them matching the auditory
description and computing the time they spend looking at
each visual display. Looking time to the matching display
reveals processing of the auditory word (Fernald et al.,
2008). This logic has been used to assess language processing in minimally verbal populations such as young infants
(Brandone et al., 2007; Seidl et al., 2003) and children with
motor impairments (Cauley et al., 1989). However, eye-tracking techniques are not suitable in populations where gaze fixation or eye movements may be impaired, such as in
autism (Riby & Doherty, 2009; Schmitt et al., 2014).
Noninvasive neuroimaging, such as electroencephalography (EEG), may offer an opportunity to measure language understanding in the absence of reliable behavioral
or eye movement responses. EEG is a passive way to record
neural responses and offers the opportunity to measure
language understanding. In particular, the N400 eventrelated potential (ERP) is elicited by hearing or reading words,
with the N400 being larger when the words violate the semantic or predictive context in which they are presented (e.g.,
Kutas, 1993; Kutas & Federmeier, 2011; Kutas & Hillyard,
1980). For instance, the word “door” elicits a larger N400
ERP when it is presented in the sentence “The clouds are
high up in the door,” compared to the sentence “I had no
key to open the door.” This difference in the N400 amplitude is called the “N400 effect.” It is well documented and
has been recorded in groups of adults, children, and special populations (for a comprehensive review, see Kutas &
Federmeier, 2011), making it a strong candidate for assessing lexical–semantic processing. Accordingly, the N400
has previously been used as a neural index of linguistic processing in special populations, such as cerebral palsy (Byrne
et al., 1995, 1999), traumatic brain injury (Connolly et al.,
1999), stroke (D’Arcy et al., 2003), autism (Cantiani et al.,
2016; Coderre et al., 2019; DiStefano et al., 2019), and disorders of consciousness (Schoenle & Witzke, 2004; Steppacher
et al., 2013).

However, even in neurotypical populations, few studies have systematically assessed the ability to reliably detect
the N400 effect in individuals (Beukema et al., 2016; Cruse
et al., 2014; Rohaut et al., 2015), and to our knowledge,
only one has reported them for individual children (Cantiani
et al., 2016; albeit with only 10 participants). To date, the
sparse results on neurotypical individuals suggest that, despite
robust effects at the group level, current N400 paradigms
allow to detect N400 effect to semantic manipulations in
around half of the neurotypical individuals. This has important implications both for neurocognitive understanding of
lexico-semantic processing and for the possibility of using
N400 as a future neural marker of language processing in
nonverbal individuals. Because of the sparsity of results in
individual children and the variable N400 effect detection
rate in previous adult studies, our first aim was to add to
the knowledge base by establishing the sensitivity of two
auditory paradigms for detecting lexico-semantic processing in individual neurotypical children.
In our first experiment, neurotypical children listened
to pairs of spoken words that were either normatively associated (e.g., “arm – leg”) or unrelated (e.g., “boat – leg”).
In our second experiment, children listened to spoken sentences with either a congruent completion (i.e., “she wore
a necklace around her neck”) or an incongruent/anomalous
completion (i.e., “the princess may someday become a neck”).
These paradigms elicit strong N400 effects in groups of
adults and children (Borovsky et al., 2012; Friedrich &
Friederici, 2005; Kiang et al., 2013; Rämä et al., 2013;
Torkildsen et al., 2007), so we predicted that the ERP
evoked by the identical spoken word token (in our example, neck) would vary according to semantic context and
asked whether we could detect this difference in individual
children. To make the paradigms suitable for children,
we created game-like tasks where children encountered
friendly or evil aliens.
Our second aim, with a view to future clinical applications, was to validate an accessible EEG system that avoids
many of the typical setup inconveniences. A traditional
32-channel, gel-based EEG system takes around 35 min
to set up and is somewhat uncomfortable, involving rubbing
the participant’s scalp with gel in order to bridge the EEG
electrodes to the skin. In addition, most typical EEG setups
are not portable, with extensive wiring compelling participants to remain seated, and signals are best recorded in an
electrically shielded room, which can be intimidating for
some subjects. Although previous research has successfully
used laboratory EEG systems to test special populations
such as autistic individuals (Coderre et al., 2019; McCleery
et al., 2010) and individuals with Rett syndrome (Laan &
Vein, 2002), alternative portable solutions may allow the inclusion of more individuals in research. For example, the
laboratory environment may be too intimidating for some
autistic children, with portable solutions allowing testing in
a more familiar environment. Recently, more accessible and
more portable EEG systems have become available, one
of which has been adapted and validated for the measurement of ERPs in adults (Badcock et al., 2013; de Lissa

et al., 2015), children (Badcock et al., 2015), and autistic
children (Yau et al., 2015). The Emotiv EPOC+ system,
hereafter referred to as “EPOC+,” was originally designed
for gaming purposes and consists of a wireless headset with
14 electrodes that connect to the scalp via saline solutionsoaked cotton rolls. The setup is fast (approximately 5–10
min), and it is not necessary to rub the scalp. This system is
also low in cost compared with research-grade systems and
is wireless and portable, allowing its use outside of the laboratory (e.g., in homes or schools).
Although the EPOC system (the predecessor of
EPOC+) has been validated against research-grade systems
for recording early ERPs, such as auditory ERPs (Badcock
et al., 2013, 2015; Barham et al., 2017), and face-sensitive
N170 (de Lissa et al., 2015), studies on later components
such as the P300 have yielded less consistent results. Vos et al.
(2014) report similar performance of an Emotiv amplifier
compared to a research-grade amplifier, and Elsawy et al.
(2014) found acceptable results when using a classifier on
P300 EPOC data, but Duvinage et al. (2013) report that
the EPOC recorded a significantly noisier signal compared
to the research-grade Advanced Neuro Technology system.
To our knowledge, no studies have tested it on N400 ERPs.
Here, we tested the fidelity of the adapted Emotiv EPOC+
EEG system against data recorded concurrently from a
research-grade Neuroscan system during the experimental
tasks.
Our third aim was to assess whether we could improve
detection of lexico-semantic processing at the individual
level by using more sensitive analytical methods. Traditional univariate analyses of ERPs usually require an a
priori choice of electrodes and time points of interest.
However, when testing individual participants, especially
children and special populations, this a priori knowledge
may not be available. In contrast, multivariate pattern analyses (MVPAs) allow for consideration of multiple electrodes
at once, removing the requirement for a priori knowledge
of topology without introducing multiple comparisons.
Accordingly, we compared our detection rate of ERP differences between semantic conditions using both typical
univariate N400 analyses and MVPA. For MVPA, we
trained a linear classifier to discriminate between the two
semantic conditions (congruent and incongruent) on individual subject EEG data. This targets the information contained in the pattern of activation across sensors, making it
robust to individual differences in signal direction and topology (Grootswagers et al., 2017; Haynes, 2015; Hebart &
Baker, 2018).
To preempt our results, we found both robust grouplevel univariate N400 effects and substantial intersubject
variability in topology and time course of response. The individual subject detection rate was around 50% in both
paradigms, for both research-grade and EPOC+ systems,
using univariate analysis. In the sentence paradigm, MVPA
increased the detection rate to 88% but only for the researchgrade EEG system. The data suggest heterogeneity in the
neural responses to lexico-semantic processing in neurotypical children and may help direct future development

of paradigms for assessing language comprehension in
nonspeaking children.

Experiment 1: Associated Word Pairs
Method
Participants
Sixteen children were recruited using the Neuronauts
database of the Australian Research Council Centre of
Excellence in Cognition and its Disorders. All participants
were native English speakers and had nonverbal reasoning
and verbal abilities within the normal range as measured
by the matrices section of the Kaufman Brief Intelligence
Test–Second Edition (KBIT-2; Kaufman & Kaufman, 2004)
and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test–Fourth Edition
(PPVT-4; Dunn & Dunn, 2007). Participants received
AUD25 for their participation, as well as a sticker and
a certificate. The data from one participant were excluded
due to technical issues during recording. The final set of
data thus came from 15 participants (age range: 6–12 years,
M = 9.2, SD = 2.6; four boys and 11 girls). This study was
approved by the Macquarie University Human Research
Ethics Committee (Reference Number: 5201200658). Participants’ parents or guardians provided written consent,
and the children provided verbal consent.

Stimuli
Stimuli comprised 63 pairs of normatively associated
words. Following Cruse et al. (2014), we began with word
pairs taken from the Nelson et al. (2004) free association
norms database. These norms comprise a large number of
cue–target pairings, developed by asking participants to
produce the first meaningfully or strongly associated word
that comes to mind when presented with a particular cue.
We initially chose pairs from the normative database with
a forward associative strength (cue to target) greater than
0.5, meaning that more than 50% of the participants in the
Nelson et al. norm-development study produced this target
word in response to the cue. We included only pairs where
the target was a noun and where the cue and target were
one syllable in length. We also included only words that had
an age of acquisition rating of 8 years or less (Kuperman
et al., 2012), meaning that these words were typically known
by children of 8 years old and above. It is possible that a
few of our words were unknown to the younger participants.
However, when selecting our stimuli, we chose to maximize
the number of words fitting our criteria, acknowledging this
may have resulted in some unknown words for some participants. We excluded any pairs where either the cue or target
had a homophone (according to the N-watch database;
Davis, 2005) with an age of acquisition of less than or equal
to 10 years and where the cue or target was not applicable to
the Australian context (e.g., FUEL–GAS).
To minimize repetition across the stimulus set, we
allowed each target word to appear in a maximum of two

2363

word pairs. The cue words were only used once as cues, but
they could also appear up to twice as targets. Thus, the maximum number of repetitions of particular words across the
entire list of related items was three (i.e., once as a cue and
twice as a target—this was the case for 13 words). For word
pairs with singular and plural forms (e.g., GIRL–BOY and
GIRLS–BOYS), only the pair with the strongest association
was included. The final set of 63 pairs had a mean forward
associative strength of 0.676 (see Supplemental Material S1
for the list of stimuli). These word pairs formed the “related”
condition.
We created a list of 63 “unrelated” word pairs by recombining the cue and target words from the related condition.
Constructing the unrelated list in this way ensured a fully
balanced design in which the cues and targets in the related
and unrelated lists were identical (and therefore matched
for word frequency, familiarity, phoneme length, etc.). We
ensured that target words in the unrelated condition did not
start with the same sound and rhyme or have any semantic
or associative connections with the cue or related target. In
addition, we respected the grammatical number structure
of the related word pair when choosing an unrelated target.
For example, in creating an unrelated combination for a
plural–singular pair (e.g., SUDS–SOAP), another singular
target word was chosen (e.g., SUDS–ART).
Stimuli were digitally recorded by a female native
Australian English speaker, and the best auditory tokens,
where the voice had a natural intonation and was not raspy,
were selected using Praat software (Boersma, 2001). We
used the same target tokens in the related and unrelated conditions so that there were no auditory differences to drive a
differential EEG response to the two conditions. For each
target, the related and unrelated cue words were recorded
close together in time and were chosen to have approximately the same length, intensity, and voice quality as the
target (mean stimulus length: 834 ms, SD = 121 ms, range:
590–1124 ms).

EEG Equipment
We recorded simultaneously from two EEG systems
in an electrically shielded room. The research EEG system
Neuroscan SynAmps2 (Scan Version 4.3) Ag–AgCl electrodes
were fitted to an elastic cap (Easy Cap) at 33 locations (see
Figure 1), according to the international 10–20 system, including M1 (online reference), AFz (ground electrode), and
M2. We measured vertical and horizontal eye movements
with electrodes placed above and below the left eye and
next to the outer canthus of each eye. Neuroscan was sampled at 1000 Hz (down-sampled to 500 Hz during processing) with an online bandpass filter from 1 to 100 Hz. We
marked the onset of each sentence and target word using
parallel port events generated using the Psychophysics
Toolbox 3 extensions (Brainard, 1997; Kleiner et al., 2007;
Pelli, 1997) in MATLAB.
The EPOC+ is a wireless headset with flexible plastic
arms holding 16 gold-plated sensors. In order to accommodate the concurrent setup with the Neuroscan system, we

2364

placed the EPOC+ sensors at the following scalp locations
of the international 10–20 system (Klem et al., 1999; see
Figure 1).1 M1 acted as the online reference, and M2 was
a feed-forward reference that reduced external electrical interference. The signals from the other 14 channels were
high-pass filtered online with a 0.16-Hz cutoff, pre-amplified,
and low-pass filtered at an 83-Hz cutoff. The analogue signals were then digitized at 2048 Hz. The digitized signal was
filtered using a fifth-order sinc filter to notch out 50 and
60 Hz, low-pass filtered, and down-sampled to 128 Hz
(specifications taken from the EPOC+ system web forum).
The effective bandwidth was 0.16–43 Hz.
To accurately time-lock the ERPs to the onset of the
target word, we modified the EPOC+ system to incorporate
event markers, following Badcock et al. (2015). We did this
using a custom-made transmitter unit communicating with
a custom receiver unit through infrared light (Thie, 2013).
The transmitter box was connected to the audio output of
the presentation computer. At the onset of each sentence and
each target word, a tone of particular frequency (2400 Hz
for the sentence onset, 600 Hz for a related target onset, and
1600 Hz for an unrelated target onset) was sent to the transmitter unit through a separate audio channel. This in turn
activated the receiver unit, which generated an electrical
pulse in the O1 and O2 channels (from which we did not
acquire neural data).

Experimental Procedure
For each participant, we set up the Neuroscan system
first and adjusted the impedances to under 5 kΩ. We then
placed the EPOC+ system over the top, with cotton wool
bridging scalp to sensor through custom slits in the EasyCap.
EPOC+ impedances were adjusted to be below 20 kΩ in the
TestBench software. Setup took up to 50 min, during which
participants watched a DVD of their choice. Following setup,
participants were seated in front of a 17-in. monitor, with
speakers on both sides of the screen, at a viewing distance
of about 1 m. Before the main experiment, participants completed the PPVT-4, and after the EEG session, they completed the matrices section of the KBIT-2.
Participants completed two EEG acquisition sessions
of 20 min, separated by a 5-min break. Each session included
all 126 cue–target word pairs (63 related, 63 unrelated). The
stimuli were presented using Psychophysics Toolbox 3 extensions (Brainard, 1997; Kleiner et al., 2007; Pelli, 1997) in
MATLAB R2016B. The word pairs were presented in a
pseudorandom order, which was reversed in the second session. The order was optimized to minimize order bias in the

Note that, in the Emotiv software, TestBench 3.1.21, the electrodes
at FC3/4 are labeled F3/4, F3/4 are labeled AF3/4, and FT7/8 are
labeled FC5/6; this is because we adjusted the electrode placement
to accommodate the concurrent setup. In this article, we refer to the
electrodes according to their placement on the scalp when worn
concurrent with the Neuroscan EasyCap, not the labels used in the
Emotiv software.

sequence of related and unrelated trials, with the additional
constraint that no more than four trials in a row were of either condition. The first session was divided into 17 blocks
consisting of five to 15 trials, and the second section was
divided into 11 blocks of eight to 15 trials, as the participants were more familiar with the task during the second
session.
To make the task more engaging for children, it was
introduced in the context of a story. The child was told
that they were listening to different aliens in an Englishspeaking competition. In the competition, aliens had to
say pairs of related words (e.g., “boy–girl,” “left”–“right”)
and the children, and they had to rate each alien (one to
five stars) depending on how well it performed. We asked
participants to listen carefully to each pair and to decide
whether the two words were related or unrelated and then
to give an overall judgment of the alien’s performance at
the end of each block. Children were instructed to give between one star (if they produced mainly unrelated pairs)
and five stars (if they said mainly related words). This encouraged the children to pay attention to and make a covert
decision about the relatedness of the words in each pair.
The choice of this covert task was motivated by the results

from Cruse et al. (2014), who found that a covert design
was more sensitive than a passive design where participants
were asked to simply listen to the stimuli (58% detection
rate for the covert task vs. 0% for the passive task). According to the same study, an overt task would have been even
more sensitive, but we anticipated that minimally verbal
individuals may not give reliable overt responses, whereas
they may be able to perform the task covertly.
At the beginning of each block, an alien appeared on
the screen and then moved behind a black “recording booth”
in the middle of the screen. A light bulb was depicted on
top of the box and lit up during each trial to encourage children to pay attention and to reduce eye movements during
the trial. The light bulb lit up 500 ms before the cue word,
remained lit until 1,500 ms after the target word onset, and
then turned off. The interval between the cue and target
was 1,000 ms. After another 1,500 ms, the next trial began.
At the end of each block, the alien moved out of the box,
and participants were prompted to grade the alien on a
5-point scale regarding its overall performance. At the end
of the experiment, participants were shown the “winners”
of the alien contest. The total time, including the EEG
setup, was about 1 hr 40 min.

Off-Line EEG Processing
We processed all EEG signals in EEGLAB (v13.4.4b;
Delorme & Makeig, 2004) in MATLAB (R2014b). We first
applied a band-pass two-way sinc finite impulse response
FIR filter between 0.1 and 40 Hz, allowing to have the same
off-line filtering procedure for both systems, and then we cut
the data into epochs from −100 to 1,000 ms around target
word onset. We ran an independent component analysis (ICA)
on all the epochs. Components with scalp distribution, frequency, and timing that corresponded to eye movements
and eye blinks were removed from the Neuroscan data. In
line with a previous EPOC+ study with children (Badcock
et al., 2015), we could not identify any eye blink artifacts in
the EPOC+ data. This may be because eye blinks were not
consistent or strong enough to affect EPOC+ data. Alternatively, the ICA for the Neuroscan data could have benefited
from the signal recorded by the Neuroscan electrodes recording eye movements. The EPOC+ did not have such
electrodes so the ICA for the EPOC+ used only the scalp
electrodes. The epochs were baseline corrected against the
averaged signal from the 100 ms preceding the target onset.
These data were then used for the decoding analyses. For
univariate analyses, we further removed, from all electrodes,
epochs with extreme values (±150 μV) in any of the electrodes
of interest (see below). As MVPAs are more robust to noise
in the data (Grootswagers et al., 2017) and require balanced
data for valid statistical inference, we did not reject noisy trials
for multivariate analyses. For the Neuroscan data, an average of 11 epochs (9%) for the related condition (SD = 7.75)
and 10 epochs (8%) for the unrelated condition (SD = 7.56)
were rejected. For the EPOC+ data, an average of 10 epochs
(8%) for the related condition (SD = 7.72) and nine epochs
(7%) for the unrelated condition (SD = 6.11) were rejected.

Group ERP Analyses
The N400 is typically recorded over the centroparietal regions of the brain. We therefore focused our univariate
analyses on three electrodes sites of interest: Cz, as the
N400 effect is reported to be the strongest in centroparietal
sites (Kutas & Federmeier, 2011), and FC3 and FC4, which
are the closest channels to Cz that we can compare between
the Neuroscan and EPOC+ systems.
We first verified that our paradigm evoked a classic
N400 effect at a group level and tested whether this was detectable in both Neuroscan and EPOC+ systems. For trialaveraged waveforms, we ran group analyses with paired
t tests comparing the two conditions at each time point
from 150 ms after stimulus onset for each of the five sensors of interest. We corrected for multiple comparisons for
each channel independently using a statistical temporal
cluster extent threshold (Guthrie & Buchwald, 1991). Briefly,
this method calculates the autocorrelation between consecutive time points of the ERP signal, for each channel. We can
then determine the minimum number of consecutive time
points that need to show a statistical difference in a onetailed t test between the related and unrelated conditions to

2366

be considered a significant cluster at p < .05 corrected (for
details, see Guthrie & Buchwald, 1991). We used a one-tailed
test because the direction of the N400 effect (a more negative response in the unrelated condition) was prespecified.
We restricted our statistical analyses to the time points after
150 ms to decrease the number of statistical tests computed, as the N400 is typically reported to occur later than
150 ms (Kutas & Federmeier, 2011).
We illustrated the topographic distribution of the
N400 effect, based on the Neuroscan grand average data,
by subtracting activation in the related condition from the
unrelated condition and averaging over sequential 200-ms
time windows, for ease of illustration (200–400, 400–600,
600–800, and 800–1,000 ms).

Single-Subject ERP Analyses
Our next goal was to assess the sensitivity of our paradigm and EEG systems to detect N400 effects in individual
children. For each individual and each system, we conducted
first-level (single-subject) analyses using independent-samples
t tests between the two conditions at the electrodes Cz (for
Neuroscan only) and FC3 and FC4 (for both systems), for
each time point starting at + 150 ms after the target onset
(as we do not expect N400 effects to arise earlier than 150 ms,
i.e., Cruse et al., 2014). Although using independent t tests is
more conservative than paired t tests across targets, we made
this choice because the trial rejection performed during preprocessing left unbalanced (thus, not paired) trials. To correct
for multiple comparisons, we again used the autocorrelation
score to determine the temporal cluster extent threshold for
each electrode in each participant independently (mean cluster
extent threshold over participants and electrodes for Neuroscan: M = 132 ms, range: [70, 206], and for EPOC+: M = 58
ms, range: [47, 70]). We illustrated the topographic distribution of the N400 effect in individuals based on the Neuroscan
data by subtracting activation in the related from the unrelated condition and averaging over sequential 200-ms time
windows, for ease of illustration (200–400, 400–600, 600–
800, and 800–1,000 ms).
To examine intra-individual variability of N400 effects for each EEG system, we split the data into odd and
even trials. We computed the area between the related and
unrelated condition curves between 300 and 800 ms, at Cz
for the Neuroscan and F3 for the EPOC+ (these electrodes
were chosen as the locations where the N400 effect is likely
to be prominent [Kutas & Federmeier, 2000]). We used
Spearman correlation to compare the area between the
curves between odd and even trials in each individual.

Comparison of EEG Systems
We next sought to validate the EPOC+ system for
recording N400 ERPs. To compare the shape of Neuroscan
and EPOC+ waveforms, we ran intraclass correlations
(ICCs), a global index of waveform similarities and amplitude using a previously validated MATLAB script (see
McArthur & Bishop, 2004), and Spearman correlations,

which measure the rank correlation between two waveforms, providing information about the similarity of the
overall shape of the ERPs and less sensitivity to amplitude.
We compared these correlations to zero by assessing whether
the 95% confidence interval of the correlation values overlapped with zero and interpreted their magnitude according
to Cicchetti’s guidelines (Cicchetti, 1994). For this analysis,
in order to have a fair comparison between the two systems,
we re-did the preprocessing so that the Neuroscan and
EPOC+ data were as comparable as possible and treated
in the same way. For this, the processing proceeded as describe above except that we down-sampled Neuroscan data
to match EPOC+’s sampling rate of 128 Hz and we did not
remove eye blink components from either system. We then
calculated the correlations for each condition, using the entire epoch, at our two locations of interest where the electrodes from the two systems lie in close proximity: the left
and right frontocentral sites (FC3 and FC4; see locations
on Figure 2). We calculated the correlation for each condition, in each individual at these two locations. We examined whether correlations were significant by computing the
95% confidence interval of the group mean and checking if
they overlapped with 0 (which would correspond to no correlation). Finally, we asked whether the amplitude of the
N400 effect differed between the two systems. To this end,
we compared the area under the difference curve (related–
unrelated ERP), using trapezoidal integration from 300 to
800 ms, between the two systems using a two-tailed, pairedsamples t test across individuals. These time points correspond to the expected N400 effect time course (Beukema
et al., 2016; Cruse et al., 2014; Kutas & Federmeier, 2011).

Single-Subject Temporally and Spatially
Unconstrained MVPA
In order to be sensitive to individual variation in the
topology and time course of N400 effects, without increasing multiple comparisons (i.e., without analyzing every
electrode and time point separately), we used MVPA.
We analyzed all the data using the CosmoMVPA toolbox (Oosterhof et al., 2016) in MATLAB for Neuroscan
and EPOC+ separately. First, we divided our data into a
training set and a testing set, using a leave-one-target-out
cross-validation approach. The training set consisted of the
activation pattern across all the electrodes and time points
for trials corresponding to all the targets but one, and the
classifier was trained to find the decision boundary that
best distinguished between the two categories (related vs.
unrelated). Since each pair was repeated once, the training
set consisted of 248 (62 stimuli × 2 conditions × 2 repetitions) trials. We then tested the classifier’s ability to classify
the category of the remaining four trials (two related, two
unrelated) corresponding to the remaining target. We repeated
this procedure 63 times, each time leaving a different target
out. Finally, we averaged the accuracy of the classifier for
these 63 tests to yield an accuracy value for each individual.
For statistical inference, we implemented a labelpermutation test in individuals (Maris & Oostenveld, 2007).

For this test, we randomly permuted the condition label of
the targets before classification to obtain classifier accuracies under the null hypothesis. We performed 1,000 permutations for each individual to obtain a null distribution of
accuracies, to which we compared the observed (correctly
labeled) accuracy. The observed accuracy was considered
significantly above chance if it was larger than 95% of the
accuracies in the null distribution. If the classifier performed
significantly above chance, we inferred that there was information in the brain signals that differed between the two
conditions (related vs. unrelated words).

Group and Single-Subject Time-Resolved MVPA
In order to examine the time course with which the
brain data could be used to decode lexico-semantic condition,
we ran a related, time-resolved, version of the multivariate
analyses. The analyses were identical to the unconstrained
MVPA, except the decoding was run for each time point
separately, using the pattern of activities from all the electrodes (rather than all time points and all electrodes in a
single analysis). To test for significance, we again derived
an estimate of the null distribution from the data. For this,
we generated 1,000 random permutations of the condition
labels pertaining to the different trials. For each permutation, we performed the decoding analysis as before, at each
time point separately. Next, we compared the observed
(correctly labeled) decoding accuracy to the accuracy of
these permutations. To make this comparison, we computed a threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE; Smith
& Nichols, 2009) statistic at each time point for both the
observed (correctly labeled) data and for each of the 1,000
permutations, using the cosmo_montecarlo_cluster_stat
function in CoSMoMVPA. The TFCE statistic at each time
point reflects both the strength and temporal extent of the
decoding signal based on the classification accuracy at the
current and neighboring time points, allowing optimal detection of sharp accuracy peaks and weaker but sustained effects. We then extracted the maximum TFCE statistic across
all the time points for each permutation, to create a null distribution of the maximum TFCE values over permutations
(Maris & Oostenveld, 2007). In other words, we derived a
distribution of the maximum TFCE values arising across
the time course by chance. Finally, we found the 95% percentile of this null distribution and thresholded the TFCE
statistic in our observed data set with this 95% percentile
value. Data at a particular time point were considered significantly above chance at the p < .05 level if its TFCE was
larger than 95% of the TFCE values in the corrected null
distribution. This approach corrects for multiple comparisons
across time, because only those time points with TFCE
values higher than the largest TFCE value across all time
points in 95% of permutations are considered significant.
The group-level classifier accuracy over time was obtained by averaging each individual’s accuracy. For statistical inference at the group level, we implemented a signpermutation test, consisting of randomly swapping the sign
(positive or negative after subtracting chance, 50%) of the

Results
Behavioral Results
All children had a standard score within or above
the normal range (90–110) for nonverbal reasoning (KBIT:
M = 123, 95% CI [114, 131]) and receptive vocabulary
(PPVT: M = 120, 95% CI [115, 126]). We asked children
for a subjective rating (one to five stars) of the performance
of the aliens in each block, but as there was no “correct”
answer, we do not report accuracy. Children seemed to
understand the instructions well and informally reported
the task to be engaging.

Group ERP Analyses
At the group level, we replicated the typical N400
effect using the Neuroscan system. We found significant
N400 effects at all three of our regions of interest: Cz,
FC3, and FC4 (see Figure 2, left panels). For the central
location (Cz), the N400 effect was significant for a cluster
of time points from 272 to 1,000 ms, poststimulus onset
(see Figure 2, top panel). For FC3, the N400 effect was
significant for a cluster from 292 to 1,000 ms, and for
FC4, the N400 effect was significant in a cluster from 302
to 1,000 ms. The group-level topographic distribution of
the effect (see Figure 2, bottom panel) was initially centroparietal, spreading frontally at later time points. We were
also able to record N400 effects for the group using the
EPOC+ system in FC3 (from 350 to 747 ms) and FC4
(from 469 to 596 ms and from 684 to 739 ms), our two
locations of interest (see Figure 2, right panels).

Single-Subject ERP Analyses
Our next goal was to assess the detection rate of
N400 effects in individual subjects. We defined a significant N400 effect as the presence of a statistically larger
N400 in the unrelated compared to related condition (corrected for multiple comparisons across time points) in one

or both of the two locations of interest that were present in
both systems (FC3 or FC4). Table 1 shows the percentage
of participants with significant N400 effects (“detection
rate”) at each electrode. A significant N400 effect was
found in seven of the 15 (47%) participants’ Neuroscan
data and in the same number of participants’ EPOC+ data.
Two participants showed an effect in the Neuroscan data
but not in the EPOC+ data, and vice versa. Additionally,
we assessed whether interindividual differences in the N400
effect could be explained by individual factors, such as age,
vocabulary, or nonverbal reasoning. We did not find any
significant correlation between the amplitude of the N400, as
measured by the area between the curves between 300 and
800 ms recorded from Neuroscan at Cz and age (r = −.12,
p = .68), PPVT score (r = −.19, p = .52), or KBIT score
(r = −.07, p = .52).
We show the individual waveforms recorded by the
Neuroscan in Cz, which is where N400 effects are typically
recorded (see Figure 3, first and fourth columns), and in
FC3, where we have both Neuroscan and EPOC+ data
(see Figure 3, second, third, fifth, and sixth columns); FC4
results were similar. In addition, we illustrate the topography of the effect over time (see Figure 4). To summarize,
the detection rate of individual N400 effects was less than
50% with either EEG system, and large variations in the
topography of the effect were found, suggesting interindividual variabilities in the recorded neural signals.
In addition, we calculated the split-half reliability of
the N400 effect by computing the Spearman correlation
coefficient for the area under the difference curve (related–
unrelated) for odds and even trials. The split-half reliability
was moderate (according to the recent nomenclature by
Akoglu, 2018) for Neuroscan (r = .55, p = .03) and weak
for EPOC+ (r = .33, p = .23).

Comparison of EEG Systems
We next compared the responses of the two EEG
systems using ICC and Spearman rank correlation (see
Table 2) and by comparing the areas under the difference
curves. Waveforms across the two systems were qualitatively
similar in shape and positively correlated (all Spearman
rho ≥ 0.49, 95% CI not including 0 for any of the comparisons). Mean ICC values ranged from .19 to .63 across
the different conditions and sites, corresponding to fair to
good correlations (Cicchetti, 1994). The ICC was significantly greater than 0 (CIs did not include 0) for the related
condition on both sides and for the unrelated condition on
the left side, but not for the unrelated condition on the right
side. We also tested whether the amplitude of the effect
was larger for Neuroscan compared to EPOC+ (as suggested by Figure 2). The area between the related and unrelated curves was numerically larger for Neuroscan than
for EPOC+ both in FC3 (294 μV for Neuroscan vs. 140 μV
for EPOC+) and FC4 (251 μV for Neuroscan vs. 82 μV
for EPOC+), but the difference was not significant (FC3:
t(14) = 1.90, p = .0779, Cohen’s d = 0.46; FC4: t(14) = 1.74,
p = .103, Cohen’s d = 0.12). Therefore, the ERPs recorded

by the two systems were fairly comparable in shape and not
significantly different in amplitude.

Decoding Analyses
Our univariate N400 analyses were restricted to three
a priori sites of interest. However, individual topography
plots (see Figure 4) suggested that the topography of the
effect was highly variable between individuals, with effect
location ranging from centroparietal to frontal sites. Therefore, we used MVPA to integrate information from across
all sensors to detect differences in the neural patterns of
activity to related and unrelated targets. Group-level decoding performance (average over subjects) for the Neuroscan
and EPOC+ data is shown in Figure 5. For Neuroscan
(see Figure 5, purple), classifier accuracy was statistically
above chance in a cluster from 402 ms after target onset
until the end of the epoch, indicating a reliable difference
between the two conditions. There was no significant coding

2370

of associative context in the EPOC+ EEG data (see Figure 5,
yellow).
Individual decoding results for temporally and spatially unconstrained MVPA are shown in Figure 6. In the
Neuroscan data, decoding was significant in four of 15 participants (27% detection rate). For EPOC+, the classifier
only detected a significant effect in three of 15 participants
(20% detection rate).
In addition, we illustrated the time course of decoding in individuals in Figure 7. For inference, we compared
each individual’s decoding data to that individual’s labelpermuted null distribution using a TFCE statistic (see
Method section). This statistic captures both the strength
of decoding and its extent in time, allowing us to conclude
that even short temporal clusters reflect statistically robust
differences between the conditions. When analyzing decoding over time, we observe large interindividual differences
in the time course of decoding (e.g., P14 shows significant
decoding in a cluster starting at 218 ms, whereas P4 shows

sentences. We also modified the task that participants performed to make it more demanding and encourage greater
attention to the stimuli than for the word pairs task.

Method
Participants
Eighteen participants, aged 6–12 years, were recruited as described for Experiment 1. The data from two
participants were excluded due to excessive artifacts in the
EEG data. The final set of data thus came from 16 participants (Mage = 10.3 years, SD = 2.4; eight boys and eight
girls), five of whom had also participated in Experiment 1.

Experiment 2: Congruent
and Incongruent Sentences

Stimuli

As our overarching aim was to derive a sensitive measure of semantic language processing for use in individual
children, we next considered another avenue to increase detection of N400 effects. A common way to elicit N400 effects
is to present words in the context of semantically congruent
or incongruent sentences. This may yield larger N400 effects
than the word pairs task, as sentences provide a stronger
semantic context compared to a single probe word (Kutas,
1993). In addition, any deleterious effect of repeating stimuli
(which is necessary to perfectly match the stimuli across conditions) may be attenuated in sentences since so many words
are presented on each trial (e.g., Cruse et al. 2014). For this
reason, our second experiment used words presented in

We created two conditions: (a) “congruent sentences,”
which were semantically correct (e.g., “she wore a necklace
around her neck”), and (b) “incongruent sentences,” which
ended with an anomalous word (e.g., “There were candles
on the birthday neck”). The set of congruent sentences was
based on 56 high-close probability sentences from the norms
of Block and Baldwin (2010) and was chosen according to
suitability for children and such that target words were highfrequency words acquired by the age of 5 years (Kuperman
et al., 2012). We recombined sentence stems and target words
to form the set of incongruent sentences. We ensured that the
incongruent target word was unexpected but grammatically
correct. It also did not begin with the same phoneme or

rhyme with the corresponding congruent target word. Within
one session, each sentence stem and target was used twice,
once in the congruent condition and once in the incongruent
condition. The final set of stimuli consisted of 56 sentences
in each condition, 112 in total (see Supplemental Material S2
for the complete list).
The recorded stimuli were provided by a collaborator in England (S. Y.). The sentences were digitally recorded by a female native British English speaker in a
soundproof room and edited in Audacity (1999–2004).
To avoid co-articulation, the speaker recorded the sentence stems separately from the target words. This also
introduced a lengthening in the final word of the sentence
stem. Sentence stems and targets were combined online
during stimulus presentation with a 100-ms silence between the sentence frame and the target word. The target
words had a mean length of 464 ms (SD = 89 ms, range:
309–700 ms).

EEG Equipment
The equipment and experimental setup were the
same as in Experiment 1, including the completion of the

matrices section of the KBIT-2 and the PPVT-4. Participants
who completed Experiment 1 did not complete these tests
a second time.

Experimental Procedure
Participants completed two EEG recording sessions
of 25 min, separated by a 5-min break. Each session included all 112 sentences (56 congruent, 56 incongruent).
We presented the sentences in a pseudorandom order that
was reversed in the second session. We optimized the order to avoid bias in the sequence of related and unrelated
trials as described above, with all sentences presented
once before being repeated in the alternate condition,
and to maximize the distance between repeated presentations of the same target word. We allocated the sentences
to this trial order pseudorandomly with the additional
constraint that there were at least two sentences between
any repetitions of semantic content in the sentence frame
or target word. We presented an image of a satellite centrally on the screen to signal the onset of each trial and
kept this display on for the whole trial. This served as an
alerting cue and encouraged children to fixate, reducing

through the speakers, and the satellite remained onscreen
for a further 1.5 s after the presentation of the target
word. There was then a 2-s intertrial interval before the
next trial. Each 20-min session consisted of 16 blocks of
four to 10 trials, after which children gave an answer to
the experimenter (see below).
We designed a task that was strongly engaging for
children while requiring minimal overt responses. It was
embedded in the context of a story: An evil alien Lord had
messed up some of the “messages” that we were trying to
send to our extraterrestrial friends. Participants were asked
to pay attention to each sentence and to count how many
did not make sense. Accurate responses, given at the end
of each block, would help “catch” an evil alien’s henchman
who appeared on the screen. This encouraged participants
to pay attention and to make covert semantic judgments
of sentences. Most of the children appeared to be highly
engaged and motivated by the task and reported that they

2374

found it entertaining. The whole experiment, including
setup, took approximately 2 hr.

Off-Line EEG Processing, ERP, and MVPA
The correlation scores, ERP analyses, and decoding
analyses were performed as for Experiment 1. For the
Neuroscan data, an average of 12 epochs (11%) for the
related condition (SD = 8.38) and 13 epochs (12%) for
the unrelated condition (SD = 8.27) were rejected. For the

were able to notice semantic anomalies.

We recorded large N400 effects in the group using
Neuroscan in all of the electrodes of interest (see Figure 8,
left panels). We also recorded N400-like effects using the
EPOC+ system at our two locations of interest, FC3 and
FC4. However, these effects only reached significance at
FC4, possibly indicating a lesser sensitivity of the EPOC+
system (see Figure 8, right panels).
For the central location (Cz), the N400 effect started
at 171 ms and continued until 817 ms poststimulus onset
(see Figure 8, top panel). For the frontal sites, the effect
started later with a significant cluster from 409 to 697 ms
for FC3 (see Figure 8, middle left panel) and a significant
cluster from 387 to 875 ms for FC4 (see Figure 8, bottom
left panel). For EPOC+, the N400 effect was significant in
FC4 for a cluster from 418 to 752 ms. Potentials in both
conditions and all three sensors also shifted in the positive
direction over time, possibly corresponding to the closure
positive shift, an ERP component reflecting the processing
that occurs at a prosodic boundary (Steinhauer et al., 1999;
Steinhauer & Friederici, 2001).
The topographic distribution of the N400 effect is
shown in Figure 8, bottom panel. The distribution was
centrofrontal with a slight right bias. This is perhaps in
line with previous reports that found the N400 effect to
be more frontal in children than in adults (e.g., Friedrich
& Friederici, 2004, and Henderson et al., 2011, found a
centrofrontal distribution of N400 effects for infants and
children, albeit using a picture–word paradigm), although
we did not observe this in Experiment 1.

Single-Subject ERP Analyses
We then assessed the detection rate of neural responses
in individual subjects. We observed reliable N400 effects in
one or both of FC3 and FC4 in 56% of the participants with
the Neuroscan data and 50% in the EPOC+ data (detection
rates are shown in Table 3). We again did not find any significant correlation between the amplitude of the N400 effect
and age (r = −.13, p = .63), PPVT score (r = .25, p = .37), or
KBIT score (r = .41, p = .37). The topography of the effect
was again variable between participants, ranging from frontal (P1, P11, P14) to parietal (P13) locations.
Figure 9 shows individual participant waveforms for
Neuroscan electrode Cz (see Figure 9, first and fourth columns) and for Neuroscan (see Figure 9, second and fifth columns) and EPOC+ electrode FC3 (see Figure 9, third and
sixth columns), which was the site with the highest detection
rate. We again found that the topographical distribution of
the effect was variable across individuals (see Figure 10).

Again, we calculated the split-half reliability of the
N400 effect across individuals by computing the Spearman
correlation coefficient for the area under the difference curve
(related–unrelated) for odds and even trials. The split-half
reliability was again moderate for Neuroscan (r = .56, p =
.02). For EPOC+, the reliability was null (r = −.04, p =
.87), potentially reflecting poor data quality with this system when analyzing only half of the trials.

Comparison of EEG Systems
We again compared the responses of the two systems
directly using ICC and Spearman rank correlation and by
comparing the area under the difference curve at our two
locations of interest (see Table 4). Waveforms for the sentences task across the two systems were qualitatively fairly
similar in shape and amplitude, as indicated by significant
positive correlations (ICC ≥ .23, 95% CI not including zero
for any of the comparisons) for both sites and conditions.
The area between the related and unrelated curves was numerically larger for Neuroscan than for EPOC+ in both FC3
(208 μV for Neuroscan vs. 125 μV for EPOC+) and FC4
(340 μV for Neuroscan EPOC+ vs. 196 μV for EPOC+),
but the difference was not significant for either site (FC3:
t(15) = 0.82, p = .43, Cohen’s d = 0.71; FC4: t(15) = 1.44,
p = .17, Cohen’s d = 0.65).

Decoding Analyses
We again tested whether our detection rate would
improve by combining data across sensors using MVPA.
At the group level, we saw significant decoding of semantic
context (congruent or incongruent sentence frames) in the
Neuroscan data from 162 to 1,000 ms (see Figure 11, purple line). We also decoded the semantic category from the
EPOC+ group level data (see Figure 10, yellow line), at
several clusters of time points between 414 and 860 ms.
Therefore, MVPA decoding matched the time course of
univariate decoding seen at the group level in Neuroscan
and EPOC+ data (see Figure 8).
At the individual level, using temporally and spatially
unconstrained MVPA, we could decode the semantic condition from the Neuroscan data in all but two participants (88%
detection; see Figure 12, purple circles). This was a marked
improvement relative to the univariate detection rate at individual channels (38%–50%, above). However, for EPOC+,
the classifier only detected a significant effect in six of the
16 participants (38% detection rate; Figure 12, yellow circles).
In addition, we illustrate the time course of decoding
by using MVPA over time. After correction for multiple
comparisons, we detected at least one temporal cluster in
88% of participants with the Neuroscan data (see Figure 13,
purple traces) but in only 25% of participants for EPOC+
(see Figure 13, yellow traces).
Finally, we examined whether the superior decoding
of Neuroscan could be attributed to the larger number of
electrodes (33 in Neuroscan vs. 12 in EPOC+) by performing an additional time-resolved MVPA on the Neuroscan

data using only the 12 electrodes closest to the EPOC+
electrodes. In these conditions, the MVPA again performed well for the Neuroscan data, identifying statistical
differences in the signal for 88% of participants. Thus, the
Neuroscan data appeared to be more suitable for decoding than the EPOC+ data, and the difference could not
be attributed to the difference in the number or location
of electrodes.

Using a paradigm that contrasted congruent and incongruent sentences, we elicited a univariate N400 effect in

suggests that multivariate analyses, which take the pattern across all electrodes into account, may be a sensitive

way to detect effects in individuals, accounting for the
topographic variability of effects across individuals. However,
decoding was, if anything, slightly worse than univariate
analyses for the EPOC+ system (25% with MVPA, as opposed to 44% with univariate analyses), suggesting that

traditional analyses.

General Discussion
For children with impaired communication, objective
and reliable tests of language comprehension are urgently
needed. Here, we examined the consistency of neural signals across neurotypical children using two auditory N400
paradigms. We assessed the detection of discriminative brain
signals in response to identical spoken words presented in
the context of a congruent and incongruent single word
prime (Experiment 1) or sentence frame (Experiment 2) and
compared the signal recorded by a low-cost gaming EEG
system, Emotiv EPOC+, to that recorded by a traditional
research EEG system, Neuroscan SynAmps2. We further
used two approaches to evaluate the electrophysiological
response: univariate analysis of the N400 effect and multivariate decoding. We found that the N400 effect could be
observed at the group level and detected at an individual level
in about half of the children, using either paradigm (word
pairs or sentences) and using either EEG system. However,
the sentences paradigm, in which children counted the incongruent sentences, was more promising, with the best
individual participant detection rate, 88%, given by multivariate analyses of the Neuroscan data.

Despite an extensive body of literature on the N400
effect, only a few studies have carried out statistical testing at
the individual subject level or report individual participants’
waveforms. In our data, statistically significant traditional
N400 effects were present in about half of our participants
using either normatively associated word pairs or sentences
to induce a violation of lexical–semantic predictions. This
may seem low, given that the N400 is widely reported to be
a large and robust effect (e.g., Kutas & Federmeier, 2011),
but it is in fact similar to statistical detection rates in adults
using similar tasks (Cruse et al., 2014). This raises an important question about how robust and prevalent individual
N400 effects actually are. At a minimum, it points to large
interindividual variability in the presence and strength of
neural responses. There are several possible explanations
for this variability.
It is possible that we simply lacked sensitivity to detect
consistent neural effects within testing constraints (i.e., we
needed more data to detect an effect in every individual).
This is difficult to quantify because traditional power analyses fail to capture the cluster-based multiple-comparisons
correction we used in our univariate analyses. We do note,
however, that the signal was noisy at the individual level, as
illustrated by individuals’ ERP waveforms. This is due to
averaging fewer trials together compared to grand average
ERPs and the possibility that trials are noisier than in adults
to begin with because of children’s movements during the

The gray distribution shows the null distribution obtained by the permutation test for that participant with Neuroscan (for visualization, the

task. This low signal-to-noise ratio is reflected by medium
to low split-half intra-individual reliability of the N400 effects (r = .5 for Neuroscan in both experiments; r = .33
and r = −.04 for EPOC+ in each experiment, respectively).
This is lower than previously reported N400 reliability data
(e.g., Kiang et al., 2013, reported high reliability [r = .85]
in typical adults with an average of approximately 150 usable trials).
It is also possible that lexico-semantic differences and
incongruencies were not processed similarly at a cognitive
level across individuals. For example, individuals may vary
in the extent to which they attempt to integrate the unpredicted target word into the semantic context or process differently the wider experiment probabilistic design, where
predictions were violated 50% of the time. In addition, or
instead, it is possible that individuals may have similar cognitive processing but the neural substrates supporting this
processing vary. Previous studies have reported that N400
effects vary with age (e.g., Atchley et al., 2006; Holcomb
et al., 1992; Juottonen et al., 1996), nonverbal intelligence
(Jaušovec & Jaušovec, 2000), and vocabulary knowledge
(Byrne et al. 1995; although see Henderson et al., 2011, for
an absence of relationship with vocabulary knowledge). In
our data, there was no simple explanation for interindividual

2380

variability in N400—we did not find any association of
N400 with vocabulary or nonverbal intelligence score. However, since our sample size was very small (n = 15 and 16)
and our stimuli were not designed to test these associations,
we do not draw any strong conclusion from this.
The details of the stimuli and the participants’ task
also seem likely to affect the size of the N400 (e.g., Bentin
et al., 1993; Chwilla et al., 1995; Ortega et al., 2008; Perrin
& Garcı a-Larrea, 2003) and therefore, presumably, individual subject detection rate. For example, Cruse et al. (2014)
reported superior individual subject detection rates for active
and overt tasks relative to passive tasks. Cruse et al. also
reported superior rates for normatively associated word
pairs (50%) than for sentences (17%) when heard passively.
However, we found that the response to the two stimulus
sets was comparable and, if anything, slightly better for
sentences, when we considered an effect recorded from
either of our sites of interest (47% in word pairs and 56%
in sentences). The numerically lower sensitivity of our word
pair paradigm compared to the sentence paradigm may be
due to the repetition of the target words during the experiment (each target word was repeated between 2 and 4 times
per condition). Stimuli repetition has been found to reduce
the strength of the N400 effect, especially in word pair

paradigms (Cruse et al., 2014; Duncan et al., 2009), but
may be less of a problem when using sentence stimuli, as
they contain many words that are naturally repeated (Cruse
et al., 2014).
Our individual participant data also emphasize the variability in topography and time course of individual N400
responses (previously suggested by Henderson et al., 2011),
which may be particularly important to consider when testing children and special populations and might necessitate
different analysis approaches. For example, in those participants not showing a reliable N400 effect, it is possible that
univariate analyses failed to detect more subtle changes in
the neural responses or that N400-like responses occurred
in EEG channels that were not analyzed. To overcome this,
we employed MVPA to integrate information from across
all the sensors and time points (unconstrained decoding) or
across all the sensors at each time point (time series decoding). Unconstrained MVPA provides a sensitive method of
assessing effects occurring at any location or combination
of locations and at any time without increasing Type I error
(only one statistical test is performed on the pattern of

response across all sensors and time points) at the cost of
specificity regarding where and when the effect arises (e.g.,
Grootswagers et al., 2017). Time series decoding provides
more information regarding the timing of discriminant
neural patterns but requires correcting for multiple statistical tests (one per time point).
With our multivariate approach, semantic condition
could be decoded from the Neuroscan data in all but two
individuals in Experiment 2 (88% detection rate). In our
pursuit of an individualized neural marker of language comprehension, this is encouraging. It also confirms the intuition
that considering the signal recorded by all electrodes can
be more powerful than restricting analysis to one or a few.
Even though the N400 effect is well established as having a
centroparietal topography at the group level, our data suggest that there is variation in topology at the individual subject level, and we anticipate that the variation may be even
greater among minimally verbal autistic children whose
neural patterns are known to be heterogeneous (Salmond
et al., 2007). Moreover, we do not want to be too restrictive
a priori because, ultimately, any statistically significant

decodable difference between the brain responses to identical
auditory tokens presented in different semantic contexts
will be meaningful, independent of “where” (and to a certain extent “when”) this effect occurs.
Following this logic, it is also possible that the higher
MVPA detection rate obtained with our sentence paradigm
compared to the word pairs paradigm reflects neural processes in response to the task (e.g., participants counting—
or recognizing and attempting to count—the incongruent
sentences). In this case, we would not be detecting the brain
responses to semantic condition per se but rather the brain
responses to the task. For our purpose of detecting receptive language, however, this would still be meaningful. This
is because differential neural processing in one condition indicates that the context of the target word must have been
sufficiently processed to influence the way in which the
identical auditory token is responded to.
Nonetheless, we acknowledge two limitations of the
current approach for future clinical testing. First, MVPA
does not specify the nature of the differential processing
(where and when it occurred, for the unconstrained approach,
or the direction of the effect). Particularly for participants
where only a few time points show above-chance decoding
accuracy, even though they are corrected for multiple
comparisons, we may not feel confident in using this result
alone for clinical assessment. As such, it is probably preferable to combine the sensitivity of the MVPA approach with
specific and illustrative univariate analyses to increase confidence in the presence of neural signals that reflect language comprehension. Second, for our sentence paradigm
where participants had to count the number of incorrect
sentences, if we are only decoding the cognitive process of
counting, we may miss semantic processing in individuals
that lack the cognitive resources to count despite otherwise
understanding the sentences.
A critical consideration that follows from this is
whether our task will be feasible for the populations we would
like to use it with. Although in some regard a completely
passive task would be preferable, here, we considered a
trade-off between the likely sensitivity of the task and how
demanding that task is. We hypothesized that, at least, some
minimally verbal autistic individuals with good receptive
language may be able to follow instructions covertly, even
if they cannot do so overtly. We do acknowledge, however,
that this approach risks missing effects in children who are
unable to follow these instructions, perhaps due to poor
working memory, attention, or motivation, despite preserved linguistic processing. Finally, we assessed the sensitivity of low-cost wireless EEG technology, Emotiv EPOC+,
for detecting N400 effects. For univariate analyses, EPOC+
was able to record N400 effects at the group level and
showed a similar detection rate to the research system at
the individual subject level. Moreover, when we formally
compared the data between systems, we found that the
waveforms recorded by EPOC+ were fairly similar in shape
and amplitude to those recorded by the research system, with
ICC between systems significant and of “fair” magnitude.
Our result adds to the previous literature demonstrating

2382

the usability of the EPOC+ to record ERPs (Badcock
et al., 2013, 2015; de Lissa et al., 2015; Duvinage et al.,
2013) and shows that late ERPs such as the N400 can
also be recorded with a low-cost, portable system. Nonetheless, the effects recorded with EPOC+ tended to be of
numerically lower amplitude than for Neuroscan, and detection rate did not improve with MVPA meaning that the
best detection rate for Neuroscan (88%, MVPA, Experiment 2) was far above the best with EPOC+ (50%, univariate, Experiment 2). Together, our results suggest that
Neuroscan would be a preferable option to record quality
EEG data, but portable systems such as EPOC+ may
prove a valuable alternative in cases where standard EEG
setups are unfeasible, such as for certain clinical populations.
A few limitations of the EPOC+ system could be
mitigated in future research. First, due to a limitation of
the software (Testbench software), the impedance of the
EPOC+ electrodes was not assessed precisely and we were
only able to ensure that it remained lower than 20 kΩ for
each electrode. It is thus likely that impedances were higher
for EPOC+ than for Neuroscan (for which impedances
were adjusted to < 5 kΩ), although the differences between
the systems (e.g., active vs. passive electrodes, respectively)
make differences in impedance difficult to interpret. Use
of a more precise measure of impedance to ensure the best
possible connection in every participant would be beneficial. Second, the N400 effect was centrally distributed on
the scalp, at least at the group level, in accordance with
previous literature (Friedrich & Friederici, 2004; Kutas &
Federmeier, 2011), and the EPOC+ headset does not have
any central sensors. In future research, researchers should
consider wiring an additional electrode in a centroparietal
location where the effects were the largest. It is also important to consider the trade-off between the sensitivity we
want to achieve (in which case Neuroscan may be more
suitable), and the level of portability and accessibility (in
which case EPOC+ is more suitable). In particular, when
testing children or special populations, the possibility of
recording EEG outside of the lab with an easy and fast
setup procedure should be considered as a trade-off against
EPOC+’s apparently lower sensitivity, especially in the
context of multivariate analyses, and may motivate using
portable systems primarily in cases where it would be impossible to obtain data on a research-grade system.
Taken together, our results indicate that it may be
possible to index lexical–semantic processing in individual
children using EEG. However, contrasting the results we
obtained from different paradigms, EEG systems, and analysis methods, several trade-offs have to be considered. The
best individual subject detection rate (88%) was yielded
from MVPA of research-grade EEG data in response to
identical spoken words presented in the context of congruent and incongruent sentences and a sentence counting task
(Experiment 2). Our variable individual subject data emphasize the importance of analyzing and reporting individual ERP results, in addition to the grand average data, to
illustrate the variability in the presence, location, and timing
of ERPs.

Conclusion
In this study, we set out to establish the rate with which
we could detect discriminative brain signals in response to
lexico-semantic violations in individual children. We devised
two paradigms that used identical spoken language tokens
presented in congruent or incongruent lexical–semantic
contexts. Additionally, with clinical applications in mind,
we tested whether we could use a portable and low-cost device, Emotiv EPOC+, to measure these neural signals. Our
results suggest that large interindividual variability in the
neural signatures of lexico-semantic processing exist, even
in the neurotypical population. Despite this variability, we
replicated group-level N400 effects in neurotypical children
using both the EPOC+ and the research-grade Neuroscan
system. At an individual level, an N400 effect was evoked
in about half of neurotypical children using either Neuroscan
or EPOC+ systems. MVPAs allowed us to reach near-perfect
detection rate with Neuroscan EEG in Experiment 2, with
only two participants not showing a reliable electrophysiological signature to semantic anomalies in sentences. Despite limitations for clinical application in its current form,
these results give us a basis for future research developing a
test for receptive language processing in people who are unable to communicate.
