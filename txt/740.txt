Abstract
Decision behavior may be regarded as a specific and a very important category of human
behavior. Decision processes are what gives us the power to be different from each other,
they are what enables us to gain charge of our own life. The influence of cognitive and
emotional processes on decisions have been recently highlighted. Emotions are automatic
processes, and may occur consciously or non-consciously. They constantly interplay with
the conscious process of cognition, and determine the course of decision processes. In extant literature, much work remains to be done, to explore whether and how emotional and
cognitive processes influence how external contexts are perceived, and how these influences manifest as behavior. This thesis is an attempt to explore these interrelationships.
In this present work, the role of external and internal influences on economic decision processes, and consequently on decision behavior, are studied. To this end, a NeuroIS method is applied, in order to measure internal processes (of emotions and cognitive
workload). Research models describing these interrelationships are proposed and verified using appropriate statistical approaches. Three experimental studies are conducted
and presented, in specific decision-making contexts (of financial trading, auctions, and
serious games), with parameterization for external influences (such as information, gains
and losses, and uncertainty) on behavior. Our results highlight the following: across participants, (1) each environmental factor potentially impacts a different internal process;
(2) the direction and the extent to which these external processes impact behavior can be
modelled; (3) taking personality factors into account provides further explanation on the
extent of their impacts on decision behavior.
In order to conduct these experiments, the lack of a suitable experimental platform
for performing NeuroIS studies was additionally recognized. Hence, as part of the thesis,
Brownie, a NeuroIS platform for lab experiment, is designed and developed, using a design
science approach. In addition to the experiments in this thesis, the use of the platform in
other behavioral research contexts is demonstrated and evaluated.

Acknowledgements
The butterfly effect is indeed a true phenomenon. Sequence of events, and fortunate accidents can lead us to interesting things. Writing this thesis has been one such experience.
Firstly, I am extremely grateful to the events which landed me the scholarship at IISM, KIT
to pursue and explore this research topic. A few important people made that happen the first one was Dr. Marc Adam, my postdoc, and mentor, whose support and guidance
through this process has been immeasurable. I would like to thank him for believing in
me, and for encouraging me to bringing out this thesis. I knew when I spoke to him that I
had to do this, and be part of this group here. I continue to be inspired by the perfectionist
and the brilliant scientist that he is, and will continue learning from him.
Next, I would like to thank Dr. Verena Dorner, who brought about an immense number
of changes in my thought process. I am impressed, inspired by her, and grateful to her
for her extraordinary speed in guiding me to complete my thesis. I look forward to doing
more research with her.
The next important person is my husband, Balaji Venugopal. He was by my side, in
front of me - pulling me ahead, and behind me - when I was too fast. He did pretty much
everything for me during these three years, and this work is dedicated to him, without
whose love and faith it would not even be imaginable.
Fourth, my mother, who has been a part of me, supporting me in every possible way, be
it on Skype, or a quick phone call, or simply, just saying the most needed positive words
always. My father, for making me see light when it got dark, nudging me to grow up, and
for contributing by asking his extremely relevant and stimulating questions.
I would especially like to thank my sister, and my husband’s sister, for understanding
my tantrums, and for believing in me. And my parents-in-law, who were nothing but
parents for me, and pardoned and accepted me for all my "student-like-behavior". A special
mention to my grandmother for being with me for 3 months in our apartment, and to Prof.
Dr. Sethuraman, for his interesting insights into the topic during his visit to Germany.
Few colleagues made this process really enjoyable. The first one of them is Magie Hall she was one of the key driving forces when I decided to come here from Singapore. I knew
even before I came here that I was not alone - in any fathomable way. Thank you for making
this journey so interesting, and for inspiring me with every one little of your actions. Keep
rocking the world! Two equally important balancing factors, were Dr. Christian Haas, and
Dr. Alexander Schuller, who were extraordinarily efficient in grounding me at the right

time, and in making me feel at home in those initial months of strangeness. I am also
greatful for the special friendship with Anders Dalen, for his infinite supply of optimism,
and with Tim Straub - to whom I never needed to explain anything, and he already knew.
I would also like to especially thank Dr. Tobias Kranz, for his "continuous" inculcation
of German habits into me, and to Marius Mueller - for sharing the work of Brownie, for his
patience, and for being my buddy throughout. Lastly, but certainly not least, I would like
to thank Ewa Lux, for everything. She came along in my final year, and I couldn’t have
asked for a more lively office companion, and the eager researcher that she is. Thank you
for the positivity that you brought.
I would also like to thank all colleagues at the Lehrstuhl (Dr. Jella Pfeiffer, Dr. Timm
Teubner, Dr. Philipp Astor, Dr. Philipp Stroehle, Niklas Horstmann, Daniel Schnurr, Felix Fritz, Florian Salah, Florian Hawlitschek, Claudia Niemeyer), and alumni (Dr. Sarah
Zhang) who constantly inspired me with their thoughts and ideas, for laughing at me, for
their insights, and their different pursuits of truth, in their own special unique ways.
I would like to thank my close Indian friends and support system in Germany, who were
more of a family for me - Vinatha, Sesha, Dr. Nidhi, Vijayaraghavan, Rashmi, Mahalingam,
Anjna, Prasanna, and Vijay. Thank you for watering me constantly with your love and
affection, for reminding me and helping me to take breaks. I also would like to thank my
friends Saranya, Srilakshmi, and Sneha from Singapore, who are now scattered in different
parts of the world, but continue to inspire and energize through our special Whatsapp
group.
Lastly, and most importantly, I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Christof
Weinhardt, for providing me with this golden opportunity. I would especially like to thank
him for encouraging me to think from the shoes of an economist, for teaching me about
maximizing social welfare, and for inspiring with his deep rooted, untiring enthusiasm and
commitment towards research and teaching.

Human behavior flows from three main sources: de-

sire, emotion, and knowledge.
PLATO (PHILOSOPHER, 427-347 BC)

Decision behavior may be regarded as a specific and a very important category of human behavior. Decision processes are what give us the power to be different from each
other, they are what enable us to gain charge of our own life. There are two types of
influences that may impact decision behavior (Bechara and Damasio, 2005). The first
one of them - is dynamic external influence. In trading and auction contexts, continuous
updates on prices serve as external (informational) influences. Another example of external influence in auction and group decision contexts, is the presence of other peers, and
their behavior. These external influences trigger specific internal processes (namely, cognitive and emotional) in us, ultimately manifesting as behavior. For instance, information
triggers cognitive thought processes, whereas aspects such as time pressure or social competition might trigger emotional processes. These two processes, namely emotional and
cognitive, are categorized as the second type of influence - internal - on behavior. From
a digital-world perspective, the loop which describes how behavior may be influenced by
external and internall influences, is a fascinating one, (Bechara and Damasio, 2005, c.f.
the body-loop and the as-if-body-loop), and it is this loop which we investigate further in
our studies. In this spirit, this work is dedicated to studying economic decision behavior,
and to understanding the interplay of affective processes (e.g., emotion and desire) and

1

Chapter 1 Introduction
cognitive processes (e.g., knowledge and analytical reasoning), and how this interplay is
affected by external factors.
This thesis contributes to research that studies the influence of emotions and cognitive workload on economic decision processes. We hence attempt to quantify, to what
extent these external and internal influences impact economic decision-making, and how
user interface design and user experience may be enhanced by using these results. These
findings contribute to behavioral theory to better understand the interplay of cognitive
and affective influences in decision-making, in settings with specific external influencers.
In order to measure and study affective and cognitive processes, we adopt and follow a
NeuroIS approach. NeuroIS is formally defined as the method of integrating neuroscientific and neurophysiological theories for the design of IT artefacts (Riedl et al., 2010). It
has shown to be increasingly relevant in furthering the understanding of decision-making,
with applications in the context of electronic markets as well (Adam et al., 2011; Dawson et al., 2011). NeuroIS methods facilitate the measurement of physiological changes
accompanying the use of technology, in the form of affective and cognitive processes.

1.1 Internal processes and decision behavior
As stated earlier, influences on decision behavior may be broadly categorized as being
external,or internal. To understand human decision behavior, the realm of behavioral economics has given new perspectives - moving from traditional utility theories, to factoring
in both the influences of external and internal factors on decision-makers (Kahneman and
Tversky, 1979; Damasio, 2003). Formally defined, internal or innate processes encompass
the cognitive and affective processes, and the associated neural processes that underlie individual behavior. Affective and cognitive processes are defined in this thesis, based on
the model by Walla and Panksepp (2013). At the base of this model, are (raw) affective
processes, i.e., the unconscious processes which occur naturally without effort, and are
accompanied by physiological changes. Second, (parsed) emotions are consequences of
raw affective processing, and can be modified by the influence of higher order processes,
thus giving semantic meaning to the raw affective processes. Third, is the process of cognition, which is the deliberative and conscious process occurring in the neocortical part of
the brain. Cognition is hence viewed independent of raw affective processes. Based on
this distinction, in the scope of this thesis, we are primarily concerned with raw affective

2

1.1 Internal processes and decision behavior
processes - which are unconscious, and without any interpretation as an emotion - and
cognitive processes - which are entirely conscious and deliberative.
The first and foremost internal process considered in this thesis is the role of affect.
An affective process is defined to be unconscious, and not processed by higher cognitive
functions, and accompanied by bodily changes, such as increased heart rate, a higher skin
conductance response, or dilation of the pupils (Walla and Panksepp, 2013). Measuring
these physiological changes is useful to unobtrusively obtain information about the internal state of a person, especially when the state is constantly changing due to the context.
For instance, a sudden excitement from a calm state, or a heightened state of arousal after this sudden excitement, may be measurable and observable physiologically. To assess
these changes, bio-sensors have been increasingly utilized to measure physiological activity, particularly that of affective processing, in recent literature (Fernandez et al., 2012;
Astor et al., 2013a). While earlier studies have studied how affective processes (i.e. arousal
levels) are varied in different economic contexts, the primary question we address in this
thesis is, to what extent, and in which direction do affective processes impact decisionmaking. Are they a pre-requisite for decision-making such as illustrated by (Bechara and
Damasio, 2005), or is the influence of affective processes on decision processes contextdependent (Shiv et al., 2005)?
In understanding the impact of affective processes, it has been highlighted in earlier
literature that it is vital to consider individual differences in emotional processing capabilities (Fenton-O’Creevy et al., 2012). Whether a person "allows" emotions to influence
his behavior or not, is dependent on his emotion regulation strategy (Gross and John,
2003). For instance, reappraisers (i.e., the strategy of altering a situation’s meaning in a
way that alters its emotional impact) have shown to maximize their utility better, whereas
suppressors (i.e., the strategy of modulating the response after it has been generated)
have shown to be make fewer utility maximizing decisions (Heilman et al., 2010). Hence,
in addition to the direct impact of affect on decision processes, we examine whether the
role of affective processes depends on individual characteristics, in particular, the emotion
regulation strategies employed by a person, and if so, how do these dependencies impact
decision-making.
The second internal process we study is that of deliberative and conscious processes,
which is accompanied by cognitive workload (Phelps, 2006). In a typical economic decisionmaking process, cognitive workload is manifested when thinking about decision alternatives, factoring in several parameters, or even including others’ knowledge levels, strate-

gies and behavior. Arriving at the theoretically-expected equilibrium decision is further
made difficult, in situations that require estimation of the probability of an event to occur,
or in factoring in the information uncertainty associated with a context. Theory states
that, whether a rational (deliberative) cognitive process is applied, or a fast (automatic)
affective process takes charge, depends to a large extent on the external and business factors, including aspects of risk, uncertainty, and even time pressure (Gigerenzer and Gaissmaier, 2011; Lieberman, 2007). Hence, we examine in this thesis, how cognition impacts
decision-making, and how affect and cognition interplay with each other in determining
decision processes.

1.2 External influences and decision behavior
External influences may be aggregated to the notion of environment, i.e., the external set
of circumstances that have an impact on, but are outside the control of the decision maker
(Hurwicz, 1973). These encompass the entities, physical environment and events relative
to which individuals must act (Damasio, 2003). Smith (1989) defined the environment as
the collection of all agents’ characteristics, and also the set of business factors that impact
demand and supply. From the perspective of engineering and designing markets, whether
a scenario is stable, or whether it contains vagaries due to external factors, matters for design (Weinhardt et al., 2003). Specifically, these external factors might induce uncertainty
in price, as well as the information regarding prices available to different agents. This
information uncertainty, about the true value of a price, consequently determines decision processes, individual behavior, thus ultimately impacting the overall market outcome
as well. Other examples of external influences would be, probability of occurrence of an
event (how probable it is, that a stock rises in value), the amount of time available to
arrive at a decision, and the uncertainty associated in determining the value of a product,
etc. Hence, the questions explored in this thesis are relevant from a market engineering
perspective, especially in the domain of electronic markets and the design thereof.
External influences undoubtedly determine behavior to a large degree. For the purpose
of this thesis, we classify the external influences to be of three types. The first one of them
is events, i.e., circumstances which occur in nature and shape our decision processes, as
defined in the context of an emotional framework for auction bidding (Adam et al., 2011).
A specific type of event we consider in this work, is the financial gains or losses that occur
due to several factors in a given situation. Under the assumption that an external event

4

1.2 External influences and decision behavior
(gain or loss) has occurred, we focus on the influence of this event on subsequent decision processes. The second type is known parameters, i.e., factors which may be altered
by a system designer, and whose information is also available to the decision-maker. This
definition is close to the traditional definition of an institution, i.e., humanly devised constraints imposed on human interaction (North, 1987). We will examine two such known
parameters: the amount of time available to arrive at a decision, or whether a user is in an
individual or a group decision context. The third type of external influence we consider, is
that of unknown parameters, i.e., factors which may not be altered by a system designer,
and whose information is not (directly) available to the decision-maker, which goes back
to the definition of environment by Smith (1989). An unknown parameter we study in
this work, is the information uncertainty concerning a value, or uncertainty about how
much others estimate a given product. The second unknown parameter, is the probability
of occurrence of an event, such as how probable is it for a gain or a loss to occur. In the
following, we will look into each of these external influences, and why it is important to
study them, iin more detail.
Turning towards the external influences, the first influence we study, is how the experience of gains and losses might alter decision behavior (i.e., an event). In a large
market setting with thousands of traders, gains and losses may be viewed upon as an
external influence that impacts individual behavior, when an individual has minimal influence on overall market prices, and price formation. Under prospect theory, when faced
with choices involving simple lotteries, people have been shown to behave as if maximizing an "S"-shaped value function, whose shape implies that, utility is often defined on gains
and losses rather than on levels of wealth (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). In particular,
Odean (1998) showed that the experience of financial gains and losses manifests as affective reactions, and hence, is likely to distort the role of business factors and compel people
to act based on affective influences. This phenomenon has been termed as the disposition
effect, i.e., the tendency to hold losses too long, and to sell gains too quickly. Hence, it
appears that the external influence of a financial gain or a loss, impacts decision behavior,
and should be taken together with how we deal with these losses internally. These two
ultimately determine whether a utility maximizing decision is reached or not. We hence involve ourselves in understanding decision behavior, given that a gain or a loss has already
occurred, due to the (possible) differences in perceiving and factoring in the (emotional)
impact of gains and losses on subsequent decision processes.
The second external influence we study, is a known parameter, namely, the amount of
time available to arrive at a decision. The question whether there is sufficient time to think

5

Chapter 1 Introduction
deliberatively during decision-making, or only little time to act based on an affect-based
heuristic, is one that has been studied in the context of decision processes, as well as in
the NeuroIS literature. Specifically, whether a person is bidding in a fast or a slow Dutch
auction, has shown to lead to unexpected differences in bidding behavior, and to determine
the final auction prices (Adam et al., 2012b). Time available (or the lack thereof) has also
shown to reduce (or augment) the occurrence of what is called as competitive arousal (Ku
et al., 2005), and to consequently impact bidding behavior. Taking this background into
account, we examine the influence of available time, which is a known parameter, and
its influence on economic decision processes. In the context of auctions, time available is
modelled as auction dynamics (whether it is a static or a dynamic auction).
The third external influence we study, is a known parameter - that of the group context
a person is placed in. Decision-makers have shown to apply different strategies, whether
they are placed in an individual context, or whether they are making decisions in a group
context (Peng and Hsieh, 2012). In addition, the relationship between individuals in a
group is important to understand, since performance is often predicted by, for instance,
whether the individual is in cooperation with others in the group, or in competition. These
factors have shown to influence how the task is perceived, how much effort is put into it,
and consequently how well a person tends to perform (Bolton et al., 2005). The setting
(whether it is individual or group), is hence an important external factor, which influences
individual decision processes to a large extent, and we study this influence in this thesis.
The final external influence we consider is an unknown parameter, namely, uncertainty
in determining the true value of a product. Yin (2006) suggested that uncertainty about
a product’s value may arise due to dispersed information across users. Another source
of uncertainty could stem regarding the trustworthiness of the seller, or the e-commerce
platform that is being used. Value uncertainty reflects the degree of information available
to the various users, and in an auction, it is highly relevant, since it determines the winning
bid, and hence the payoff of the bidders, as well as the auctioneer. Hence, it is likely,
that uncertainty about the value of a product, and to what extent people factor in this
uncertainty is a key determinant of decision processes.
The next section outlines the research questions posed in this thesis, pertaining to the
influence of the external and internal processes on behavior.

1.3 Research outline
Decision processes and their mechanics, are important to understand due to the possibly
high economic consequences of decision processes. They underlie everyday purchasing
decision processes in both private and professional contexts. Decision processes determine whether traders hold or sell an owned stock. They occur while estimating the value
of a product, and deciding how much to pay for it, only to be complicated further by information about the prices estimated by others, and the uncertainty in the product itself.
These various influences often occur together in nature, and to disentangle the different
effects on behavior, it is vital to study them empirically. To this end the methods of experimental economics comes to the aid, by providing a structured way to study the effects of
specific variables (both external and internal processes) on economic decision processes
in the lab.
Figure 1.1 details the overall structure of this thesis. Currently, there exists a wide variety of software to simulate decision contexts, and to study the effects of specific economic
and business factors on behavior. Before getting on with the research questions, in this
work, we spend some effort in understanding, which technologies and tools are essential
to carry out empirical research in the lab. "The right tool for the right job" is hence a key determinant of the ability to meet research goals. In addressing the requirements of NeuroIS
and research in decision-making contexts, identifying the tools was a challenging task. In
other words, there was a necessity to iteratively define and identify these requirements of
a potential platform, and develop such a platform, which is not only useful to answer the
research questions in this thesis, but is also useful for NeuroIS research and experimental
economic researchers in general. To this end, we adopt an iterative design science method:
by combining design and development, using evaluations to define further requirements,
we develop an experimental platform for NeuroIS experiments 1 . The second chapter of
this thesis addresses the following design objective:
• DO: A freely available and extensible experimental platform that facilitates (i)
experiments of individuals and groups, (ii) physiological measurements and
time synchronization, and (iii) real-time integration of physiological data
After addressing the design objective, we next turn to the research questions in this
thesis. From the psychological front, individual differences in dealing with emotional im1

pacts, i.e., the emotion regulation strategy, has shown to determine the extent of influence
of affective processes (Gross and John, 2003) on behavior. However, a gap in literature
currently, is the understanding, whether emotion regulation strategies aid to regulate and
deal with the affective impacts of experiencing losses and gains, and leads us to more utility maximizing decision-making. Hence, we aim to understand deviations from EV maximization in a trading context, by studying the direct and the moderating role of emotion
regulation strategies on emotional arousal and on EV-maximizing behavior, respectively2 .
The following research question is addressed in the third chapter:
• RQ1: In an individual context, do emotion-regulation strategies moderate the
role of integral arousal on EV-maximizing behavior, particularly in dealing with
the external influences of gains and losses?
Having considered the role of emotions and emotion regulation, it is made evident that
emotions are being continuously and consciously regulated, and balanced by deliberative thought processes. Electronic markets are a perfect stage for this dynamic interplay
between rationality and emotions. In the next study, we attempted to quantify the experienced cognitive workload and emotional arousal, and examine how the external decision
environment (i.e., the auction) moderates their impact on bidding behavior. In addition,
in comparison to the previous study, which deals with individual decisions, we dealt with
a group context, where group refers to the interaction with a computer agent. To this end,
the following research question is addressed in the fourth chapter 3 .
• RQ2: In a group context, to what extent is the relationship between cognitive
and affective processes and bid deviations determined by auction dynamics and
value uncertainty?
So far, we have studied the influence of the external decision environment (trading,
and auctions), on internal processes (emotional arousal, and cognitive workload). However, both these contexts dealt with individual decision proceses, without involving the
presence of other humans. While this is insightful to understand human behavior in itself,
it has to be stated that performance and behavior is often modified by the group setting
we are in, namely, whether it is cooperative or competitive, and how these translate to

differences in game performance. Hence, the last study of this thesis attempts to understand performance in a group context, and to study the impact of external influences &
personality-related factors, on game performance. Specifically, we address the following
research question in the fifth chapter 4 :
• RQ3: In a group context, how do external influences (cooperative and competitive game playing mode), and personality-related factors (characteristics and
internal processes) impact individual and group game performance?

There is a great satisfaction in building good tools

for other people to use.
FREEMAN DYSON,

PHYSICIST AND MATHEMATICIAN ,

1923-PRESENT

In recent years, built-in sensors in everyday devices have enjoyed a large amount of
popularity. For instance, many mobile devices now include heart rate monitors (Apple’s
iWatch, Fitbit Charge HR, or Samsung’s Gear Series) to monitor sports activities or elderly
people’s health status. Other uses include giving people with disabilities greater control
of their lives, e.g. by developing muscle- and brain-control interfaces (Zander and Kothe,
2011). Apart from the use of sensor data in biomedical applications, the potential of sensor
data for everyday applications like e-commerce websites is attracting more and more interest. However, research on how integrating biosensor data in information systems affects
IT-related behaviors and system usability is still in early stages. One of the major reasons
is the complexity of implementing, conducting and interpreting (experimental) studies in
the domain of Neuro Information Systems (NeuroIS). In other words, a substantial body
of researchers are aiming to facilitate and enhance research in Neuro-Information-Systems
(NeuroIS), and are building several tools and platforms to facilitate NeuroIS research. In
the spirit of the epigraph, in this chapter, we aim at creating one such platform, which
can be used by NeuroIS researchers in conducting experiments. We herewith present the

10

2.1 Introduction
various stages in creating this tool. The tool will be employed in conducting the studies
in this thesis, thus demonstrating the development and use of the tool. The tool has also
been used by other research teams (both internal and external) in exploring NeuroIS and
non-NeuroIS research questions.

2.1 Introduction
The proliferation of built-in biosensors has made it possible to integrate biosignals as realtime system input for everyday use, such as in stress management (Riedl et al., 2013) and
emotion regulation for financial trading (Djajadiningrat et al., 2009; Astor et al., 2013a).
As a subfield of IS research, the area of NeuroIS builds on the advances in biosensor technology, applies neuroscience theories, methods, and tools to contribute to: (i) the development of theories that enable more accurate predictions and explanations of IT-related
behaviors, and (ii) the design of IT artefacts, which positively influence technology adoption and user experience (Dimoka et al., 2011; Riedl et al., 2010, 2014). Neurophysiological data contributes to better understand NeuroIS constructs like emotions (Gregor et al.,
2014), workload (Ortiz de Guinea et al., 2013), or trust (Riedl et al., 2014), which are
important predictors of IT-related behavior. Specifically, NeuroIS methodologies are being applied in the domains of augmented reality (Moore et al., 2004), enterprise resource
planning systems (Ortiz de Guinea and Webster, 2013), marketing and consumer behavior
(Randolph, Borders, and Loe, Randolph et al.; Adam et al., 2011; Riedl et al., 2014), serious games (Li et al., 2014; Jerčić et al., 2012), recommender systems (Pfeiffer et al., 2015),
technostress (Riedl, 2012), user acceptance (Kjærgaard and Jensen, 2014), among others.
Beyond informing the design of IT aretefacts, NeuroIS also enables the development of
neuro-adaptive information systems, i.e. "systems that recognize the physiological state of
the user and that adapt, based on that information, in real-time" (Riedl et al., 2014).
The majority of NeuroIS studies have been conducted within the scope of laboratory
experiments, to study individual and group IS phenomena, while establishing high levels
of control (Vom Brocke and Liang, 2014; Vom Brocke et al., 2013). This need has been
recognized in NeuroIS as well as in other cognate areas like behavioral economics, neuroeconomics, and affective computing (Shim et al., 2006). These novel approaches in turn
require innovative and freely accessible methodological toolsets, to support researchers in
developing a deeper understanding of how they enrich human-computer interaction and
human decision making.

11

Chapter 2 Brownie: A platform for NeuroIS experiments
Establishing freely accessible toolsets that address researchers’ needs aids the NeuroIS
community and cognate areas in a number of ways. In particular, such tools can be instrumental in (1) reducing the barriers for IS researchers to engage in collaborative NeuroIS
research, (2) increasing the comparability and documentation across studies, and (3) increasing the replicability of studies. Prominent examples for tools that have aided the research communities of behavioral experimental research in general and NeuroIS research
in particular are the z-Tree platform by Fischbacher (2007) (which became a workhorse in
experimental economics with about 6100 citations), the Ledalab platform by Benedek and
Kaernbach (2010) for the analysis of electrodermal activity (about 160 citations), the ERPSim platform by Léger et al. (2007) (about 130 citations), the ORSEE platform by Greiner
et al. (2003) for recruitment of participants (about 1600 citations), and the PhysioNet platform by Moody et al. (2001) for the analysis of physiological data (about 200 citations).
But while current tools are well suited for solving issues in specific domains, we recognize
a research gap for a tool that can be used across several domains, facilitates sensor-data
collection, performs real-time biosignal analyses, is usable for individual and group interactive research scenarios, and finally, is open-source and fosters collaboration.
To overcome these challenges and to enable flexible integration of NeuroIS tools into
experimental IS research, we identify the requirements of a solution platform. We adopt
a design science approach (Peffers et al., 2007), to motivate the need for, develop a prototype, and evaluate the described IT artefact, namely, a NeuroIS tool that facilitates behavioral research. The design objective addressed in this chapter may be formulated as
follows:
DO: A freely available and extensible experimental platform that facilitates (i)
experiments of individuals and groups, (ii) physiological measurements and time
synchronization, and (iii) real-time integration of physiological data
Identifying the requirements for, we design and introduce Brownie (behavioral Research of grOups using Web and NeuroIS Experiments). Brownie is a Java-based NeuroIS
experimental platform, providing a comprehensive toolkit for a variety of experiments.
We began the development of the platform three years ago, and iteratively defined the requirements and enhanced its features by means of experiments, use cases, and workshops.
Brownie can be used to easily develop simple as well as complex interaction scenarios, involving individual (human-computer) and group (human-human) interactions. Brownie
facilitates NeuroIS research in the lab by enabling the collection, storage, and synchronization of sensor-data events (such as electrocardiography (ECG), electrodermal activ-

2.2 Problem Identification and Requirements Definition
ity (EDA), photoplethysmography (PPG), electro-encephalography (EEG)). In addition,
Brownie is geared towards integrating real-time processing of neurophysiological measurements, thus enabling research on upcoming areas, such as neuro-adaptive systems.
Brownie simplifies database storage of users’ decisions and interactions. It is flexible in
terms of available features for user interface (UI) development, and extensible in terms
of Java libraries that may be integrated on the platform.Finally, Brownie is not limited for
usage in the field of NeuroIS as it can be used for cognate domains, without involving physiological measurements as well. Its strength thus lies in settings where interaction between
participants is required, as it is the case in many economic and market experiments.
This work thus contributes to the IS community by presenting the functionality, architecture, and use cases of Brownie and thus helping researchers to use Brownie for implementing NeuroIS experiments. The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows:
Section 2.2 rolls out the design objective of this chapter, and identifies the need for a
platform to facilitate behavioral and NeuroIS research in the lab. Section 2.3 identifies the
requirements for a potential solution platform. In Section 2.4, we present the implemented
platform and the architecture of Brownie. Section 2.5.1 demonstrates the application of
Brownie in several use cases, followed by evaluation by means of a case study of one of
these use cases. The section also presents a literature-based evaluation of Brownie, followed by a usability study amongst potential experimenters. The chapter concludes with
limitations, discussions, future research and development outlook.

2.2 Problem Identification and Requirements Definition
As part of the IS research field, NeuroIS research is broadly concerned with the same
objectives of investigation as the IS field in general: designing and understanding information systems and users’ interactions with them. "The promise of NeuroIS is to complement existing research tools with neurophysiological tools that can provide reliable data
which are difficult or impossible to obtain with traditional tools, such as self-reported or
archival data" (Dimoka et al., 2010). NeuroIS shares an interest in understanding and improving human-computer interaction with cognate areas like psychology and behavioral
economics. NeuroIS also faces the difficulties that arise in studying such questions, in
particular the potential complexity of the interaction scenario with respect to participant,
situation, and system-specific factors that might confound study results. For NeuroIS, the
problem is further compounded by the difficulties inherent in measuring and processing

13

Chapter 2 Brownie: A platform for NeuroIS experiments
several modalities simultaneously, as well as spatial and temporal resolution in measurements (Riedl and Léger, 2016). These aspects require the development of controlled experiments to understand system design and its effects on behavior. To this end, we formulate
the need for experimentation in human-computer interaction based systems, as a central
problem faced by NeuroIS researchers (Gregor et al., 2014; Ortiz de Guinea et al., 2013).
Hence, in this chapter, we address this central problem by defining the scope of a solution
platform, providing a solution artefact, and evaluate the platform for this problem space.
To build and evaluate Brownie, we adopted the steps for a design science methodology as
outlined by Peffers et al. (2007).
In order to define the scope of Brownie, we first identified the platforms used by experimental laboratories in universities around the world (behavioral, with and without sensor
data) by emailing these laboratories and asking which platform(s) they used regularly for
their behavioral experiments (NeuroIS and non-NeuroIS experiments). 46 laboratories
around the world were contacted, of which 17 replied and a few provided information
about the most commonly used platform features. We summarized the commonly used
platforms in Figure 2.1 (Y-axis in Figure 2.1). For the requirement list (X-axis in Figure
2.1), we formulated requirements based on common features of the above list of candidate platforms for NeuroIS experiments by surveying features of these platforms from their
manuals, and/or website information. Since the platforms comprised a wide range of features, we categorized them into four broad requirement categories (Individual and Group
Interaction, Biosensors, Technical Requirements, Auxiliary Requirements), with related requirements in each category. Figure 2.1 indicates which requirements are satisfied by each
surveyed platform. A literature review of NeuroIS studies (see Evaluation section) added
two requirements to our list, integration of questionnaires and of multimedia. A number
of auxiliary requirements (such as open source, common programming language, linking
to a database, etc.) were formulated based on informal discussions with NeuroIS scholars
at conferences and workshops. The four requirement categories and the requirement list
were circulated among and discussed with scholars of the NeuroIS and cognate domains
at several workshops; notably the NeuroIS Gmunden Retreat, 2014, attended by eminent
NeuroIS scholars, who confirmed that these requirements indeed represented common
requirements, and commonly faced issues while implementing NeuroIS experiments.

2.3 Requirements of Solution

2.3 Requirements of Solution
2.3.1 R1: Group & individual interactions
Experimental methods can simulate a wide variety of contexts in which to study user behavior. A large part of experimental research in IS and management settings is devoted to
studying decision-making and behavior of the involved users. Fischbacher (2007) noted
that experiments necessitate features that involve messages from multiple users, which
are managed by a central entity (hence mimicking client-server architecture). In addition,
features to facilitate direct communication between users (such as trade negotiations) are
required. Although existing experimental platforms provide capabilities towards this end,
most of them are limited in ways that compromise their usability for NeuroIS research.
For instance, as stated by the developer of z-Tree (Fischbacher, 2007), the most notable
limitation of their platform concerns the timing of screen presentations. Since the server
program controls the timing, delays occur before a screen presentation triggered by the
server, is actually displayed at the client program. These delays are in the range of tenths
of seconds, which are generally irrelevant for purely economic experiments but can be
problematic for psychologically oriented experiments, specifically those involving neurophysiological measurements. A second limitation of z-Tree is the lack of interfaces to connect to external hardware and for presenting types of stimuli beyond those included in the
z-Tree platform.
From the NeuroIS perspective, researchers are often interested in the kind of activity
the user is pursuing (such as processing information, performing a cognitively demanding
task, or making an important financial decision). NeuroIS experiments study the impact of
the context on latent variables, such as emotions, workload, attention or focus-levels, formally termed as IS constructs (Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994). A precise synchronization
between the task at hand and the sensor data being measured is therefore necessary. This
can be achieved by means of suitable hardware or software events, to synchronize with
the user decisions and corresponding timestamps. However, a majority of the existing platforms function mainly as stimulus delivery interfaces, and as control programs to manage
the experiment flow (for cognitive and neurophysiological studies), and need additional
programming effort to synchronize user events with sensor data. For instance, PsychoPy
(Peirce, 2007) is a platform that allows the presentation of stimuli and collection of data for
a wide range of neuroscience, psychology and psychophysics experiments. Psychotoolbox
(Brainard, 1997) is used to measure a variety of neurophysiological thresholds, to display

15

Chapter 2 Brownie: A platform for NeuroIS experiments
specialized stimuli for functional MRI and electrophysiological experiments, or to study
categorization, perceptual learning, visual search, and visual object recognition tasks. All
these activities thus involve stimulus presentation and human-computer interaction, or
group interaction (inter-client interaction, or messages coordinated by a server). Considering the above examples, we formulate the facilitation of individual interaction (R1a),
and the facilitation of group interaction (R1b) as the first requirement to be fulfilled in a
NeuroIS platform.

2.3.2 R2: Biosignals
Employing biosignal data using sensors is an emerging method in assessing a user’s state
(such as emotions, cognitive level, focus level, relaxation state), in understanding human
behavior, and in building decision support systems (Djamasbi et al., 2008). Domains such
as wearable and affective computing focus on the utilization of biosignals in gaining accurate information about the statistics of a user (Shim et al., 2006). For instance: (i)
heart rate data can be an indicator for the amount of stress, whether a person is emotionally aroused, or is experiencing positive or negative emotions (Astor et al., 2013; Ortiz de
Guinea et al., 2013); (ii) skin conductance response can be used to measure the level
of arousal (Adam et al., 2015; Minas et al., 2014), or stress (Riedl et al., 2013); (iii)
electroencephalography (EEG) can be used to track electrical activities on the scalp and
cortical layers and to measure which regions of the brain are most active during an activity
(Gregor et al., 2014; Ortiz de Guinea et al., 2013; Kuan et al., 2014); (iv) electromyography (EMG) can be used to measure the electrical activities of the skeletal muscles to
examine the subject’s activation level and responses to stimuli (Schaaff et al., 2012; Minas
et al., 2014) (v) eye tracking can be used to measure the movement and the area of focus,
and data on fixation, gaze and saccade can be used to understand the subject’s reactions
while viewing an interface or performing a search task (Pfeiffer et al., 2014; Léger et al.,
2014); (vi) photoplethysmogram (PPG) can be used to detect activity of the sympathetic
system through changes in intravascular blood volume (Nogueira et al., 2014); (vii) in
addition to the physiological methods above, brain imaging techniques, such as functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be used to
determine neural activity of specific constructs, such as internet adoption (Dimoka et al.,
2011); and trust (Loos et al., 2010).
Incorporating sensor data in experiments demands a wide range of technical requirements. The first and foremost is the method to acquire and store data from different

16

2.3 Requirements of Solution
sensor modalities. Having different sensor modalities implies multiple sources for time
references, which makes synchronization among hardware a non-trivial problem (due to
delays and time-drifts). In addition, the sensor data needs to be synchronized with the
current experimental data (such as clicks and information processing events), either by
means of hardware triggers during the experiment, or by offline processing. The second
requirement is the time resolution for sampling. For instance, HR and EEG require measurement in the precision of milliseconds, as well as the ability to handle voluminous data
from a large number of channels (possibly ranging from 8-128) (Ortiz de Guinea et al.,
2014). While it might not be feasible to transmit this high a volume of data to a database
server directly, the platform should enable storage on each client as raw signals.
Today only a small number of experimental platforms offer these capabilities. For instance, Presentation and E-Prime (Schneider et al., 2002) support single, parallel and
serial port communication and logging of experimental events. Presentation was built
specifically for accurate stimulus delivery and event logging. It can receive eye tracking
data and produce gaze-dependent stimuli and monitor pulse-triggered counters. Inquisit
(Draine, 1998) is another platform that supports parallel port integration and could facilitate adding sensor triggers. Stim2 can be integrated with fMRI, EEG, and neuro-imaging
techniques, and interfaces seamlessly with specific hardware (such as CURRY 7 and SCAN),
as well as specific amplifiers (such as SynAmps2, SynAmps RT, or NuAmps). A comprehensive list is provided in Figure2.1.

18
FIGURE 2.1: Requirements met by current experimental platforms

2.3 Requirements of Solution
To summarize, some of the existing platforms support event logging, and several platforms facilitate neurophysiological measurements with single-user stimuli-based experiments. However, these platforms require additional effort to integrate the stimuli with the
events, or to conduct experiments on groups. To specify an event trigger, these platforms
permit modifications, but at the cost of additional effort from the experimenter. Hence,
we formulate our second requirement (R2a) as the ability to store uni- and multimodal
sensor data, and temporally synchronize these data with the various events in the experiments, in a uniform and ready-to-analyze format. A corollary of this requirement (R2b) is
the ability to perform signal quality checks, to check whether sensors are connected, and
whether data is being continuously stored.
An emerging requirement of NeuroIS research is the ability to integrate real-time processing of biosignals, and design systems based on this information. User input in the form
of real-time biosignal data is used to adapt the system response, or system design, in realtime according to the cognitive or affective state of the user (cf. Strategy 3, Vom Brocke
et al. (2013)). As stated in the NeuroIS research agenda by Riedl (2012), p.44, "Design science researchers could contribute to the development of information systems, which use
biosignals as real-time system input in order to make human-computer interaction less
stressful, and hence more convenient, enjoyable, and effective." These systems have been
termed as "neuro-adaptive" (Riedl et al., 2014), and they are developed with the aim of
improving user experience or helping the user achieve certain goals. One specific example
of a neuro-adaptive system feature is the live-biofeedback, which informs users (based on
their biosignals processed in real time) about their current internal state. Live-biofeedback
is used, for instance, in serious games and technology-enhanced learning environments
(Astor et al., 2013a; Ouwerkerk et al., 2013). In summary, neuro-adaptive systems mandate the need to integrate real-time signal processing features in an experimental platform.
To this end, we formulate R2c as the ability to incorporate features for real-time processing of sensor data, in order to design neuro-adaptive systems (e.g. interface adaptation,
interventions, live-biofeedback) for experimentation.

2.3.3 R3: Technical Requirements
We next identify a list of general technical requirements that are common to the majority of IS experiments, irrespective of whether they include elements of NeuroIS research,
or not. Existing platforms for building experiments provide the possibility of conducting experiments on websites or modified HTML pages. Of the platforms surveyed, BoxS

19

Chapter 2 Brownie: A platform for NeuroIS experiments
(Seithe, 2012), Presentation, Inquisit, Veconlab (Bostian and Holt, 2013), EconPort (Cox
and Swarthout, 2005) provide the ability to conduct experiments on specific websites and
HTML pages. While it might not be possible to conduct experiments involving biosensors without inviting people to the lab, it should still be feasible to conduct experiments
to study user behavior while browsing website content or making buy/sell decisions on
e-commerce platforms. Experiments which study specific Internet websites can then be
conducted in the lab, along with logging of physiological data, or users’ click and search
patterns on websites. Based on the above, we formulate R3a as the ability to conduct IS
experiments on websites in a controlled lab environment.
Tracking and logging of user data and activities is an important element in analyzing
user behavior. The problem with current storage methods is that platforms store the experimental data in proprietary file formats, in MS Excel or text files with their own data
format. The effort for converting these outputs to convenient storage formats is potentially
high. One solution is storing the experimental data as a schema, which simplifies experimenters’ querying, data management, and analysis needs. To this end, we formulate R3b
as the ability to provide easy data storage methods for experimenters.
Another general technical requirement across platforms is the ease-of-use in implementing an experiment. Experimental platforms may provide the experimenter with one or several of three options on how to implement an experiment. The first option is providing an
interface to develop an experiment with drag-and-drop or point-and-click methods. While
the programming overhead of experimenters is reduced in such platforms, the available set
of functions are predefined, making it difficult, or even impossible to create advanced scenarios. The second option is providing a proprietary programming or scripting language
which the experimenter must learn and apply to develop an experiment. This enables
the development of complex experiments, but at a high developmental cost. For instance,
platforms such as BoxS (Seithe, 2012) and z-Tree (Fischbacher, 2007) have their own
programming scripts and methods which are often less well-defined than standard programming languages such as C# or Java. As stated by the author of z-Tree (Fischbacher,
2007), although the programming language is sufficiently general for implementing any
kind of interaction, programming can be unnecessarily complicated in some cases, since
z-Tree neither knows procedures nor complex data types. The third and final option is
the use of commonly used programming languages, such as C# or Java. These languages
allow for object oriented programming and for extension via specific libraries. It also simplifies the process of instruction and of obtaining support in case of issues. Furthermore,
any prior knowledge of the common programming language would expedite the effort re-

20

2.3 Requirements of Solution
quired and the skills acquired by the experimenter are transferable beyond programming
the experiment. To this end, we formulate R3c as the ability to program an experiment
with a commonly used programming language, as well as the ability to implement complex
procedures, interfaces and interactive use cases in the lab.
Interlinked with the previous requirement of a common programming language, is the
scalability and extensibility aspect of the platform. While most of the platforms surveyed
in Figure 2.1 enable hardware support, they are not extensible or scalable to be combined
with other devices, such as mobile platforms, and do not have a ready-to-use API to incorporate customized analysis modules for each sensor. We formulate R3d as the ability to
extend the platform by means of available libraries, possibly for hardware, UI, and analysis
requirements.
Finally, in order to measure the underlying physiology, stimuli have been provided in the
form of text (Minas et al., 2014), images (Gregor et al., 2014; Riedl et al., 2014), sounds
(Jerčić et al., 2012), or videos (Nogueira et al., 2014). Based on the above, we formulate
R3e as the ability to incorporate various multimedia elements as stimuli in experiment
interfaces.

2.3.4 R4: Auxiliary Requirements
An important aspect of platform usage is the license model adopted. A survey of existing
platforms shows two kinds of distribution models: either they are available as open-source
(available for free, modifiable in some cases, and primarily experimental platforms developed by researchers), or are distributed at a fee (not always modifiable and primarily experimental platforms developed by companies). Being open-source implies that the source
code of the platform is available, and the platform is extensible by users and developers
of the platform. We formulate R4a as the need for a NeuroIS experimental platform to be
distributed open source, and free-of-charge.
In order to facilitate the ease-of-use and the continuous usage of a platform, another
key requirement is providing a sufficient quantity of tutorials and use cases, as well as
documentation and support by means of issue trackers or forums. These methods will
enable good understanding of the platform, and also encourage discussions for the usage
and extensibility of the platform. To this end, we formulate R4b as the requirement to provide a sufficient quantity of tutorials, documentation and support methods for a solution
platform.

21

Chapter 2 Brownie: A platform for NeuroIS experiments
Finally, replicability and reusability of scientific research is an essential requirement for
experimental economics (Friedman and Sunder, 1994), and in the realm of NeuroIS as
well. To this end, we formulate R4c as the ability to incorporate existing use cases and
implementations in new experiments, and to facilitate easy distribution and replication.
This completes the list of requirements that a platform which facilitates NeuroIS research
should fulfill. The above five requirements are summarized in Figure 2.1 which gives an
overview about which of the surveyed platforms meets which requirement.
Collecting additional information about participants is a basic requirement of virtually
all NeuroIS experiments. This includes assessment of additional data such as demographics, specific personality traits, or to record participants’ perceptions during the experiment.
Based on the above, we formulate R4d as the ability to incorporate questionnaires in a controlled lab environment.

2.4 Design and Development
The following section provides an overview of Brownie and the implemented architecture,
and how its design reflects the above enlisted requirements. The motivation for developing
Brownie emerged when the authors became aware of the growing complexity and technological challenges in conducting NeuroIS experiments, particularly since current platforms
were limited in terms of extensibility, group interaction, and biosignal integration. Hence,
a staged plan was envisioned to iteratively design a platform that would address those
needs. This section outlines the iterative problem-solving process used to design and develop Brownie. A design as a search process approach was applied to decompose the
complexity of developing a platform for laboratory experiments in the domain of NeuroIS
into sub-problems, as recommended by Peffers et al. (2007) and von Alan et al. (2004).
These sub-problems are represented by the requirements R1 to R4, which were addressed
in three main iterations of design and development. Six use cases (i.e. experiments by
internal and external researchers) guided the design and development process: to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the requirements, and evaluate the solution IS artefacts
developed in each iteration.

22

2.4 Design and Development

2.4.1 Iteration 1: Basic Client-Server Architecture
Within the first iteration, Brownie’s core client-server structure was implemented. This
first implementation featured individual (R1a) and group (R1b) interactions. Brownie is
Java-based (R3c), includes flexible data logging (R3b), and its layered architecture retains
modularity and hence extensibility (R3d) while abstracting functionality. Java was chosen
as the language of implementation, since it is platform independent, and is supported
on several operating systems. Java is also widely used for web applications, enterprise
software, and e-commerce solutions. Finally Java is the preferred choice of language in
the case of extensions to mobile development, due to its compatibility with the Android
system.
The architecture components can be classified along two dimensions: (i) whether they
are part of the client or the server side, and (ii) whether they belong to the built-in or the
customizable tier. In order to ensure encapsulation and information hiding, the platform
is separated into a built-in tier, forming core of the platform, and a customizable tier for
experimenters. The built-in tier is ready-to-use, and requires no alterations when implementing an experiment. A visualization of the built-in tier is given in Figure 2.2. The
customizable tier, on the other hand, makes it possible to implement new experiments.
Experimenters can specify user interfaces for clients, grouping rules for subjects in various
periods, assign roles to clients, and customize the experimental flow. Exemplary experiments are distributed with the source code in order to increase the ease of use for first-time
Brownie users.
According to design as a search process method (Peffers et al., 2007; von Alan et al.,
2004), each iteration of the creative and heuristic problem solving process must produce a
representation of an artefact that can be demonstrated. With respect to this first iteration of
the design and development process of Brownie, artefacts were created for two standard
decision scenarios: Trust Game (Riedl et al., 2014) and Ultimatum Game (Joe and Lin,
2008; Loewenstein, 2001). Both games were used to confirm the operability of Brownie’s
basic architecture. The games incorporated basic solutions for role management, grouping of subjects, and error and exception handling. Demonstration and discussion of these
artefacts revealed several ways in which the platform needed to be adapted for advanced
experimentation, which we addressed at the end of this iteration. For instance, the Ultimatum Game has two roles and a role matching requirement, but other experiments do
not necessarily require this step - hence, a default single role matcher assigning all subjects

23

Chapter 2 Brownie: A platform for NeuroIS experiments
to the same role throughout an experiment was implemented. Custom and experimentspecific role matching methods were also facilitated, by means of abstract classes. Similarly, general scenarios for grouping were identified (such as partner matching, random
matching, perfect stranger matching, etc.) and implemented.

2.4.2 Iteration 2: Integrating Sensors for Biosignal Acquisition
The second iteration addressed the acquisition of biosignals (R2a), including signal quality
checks (R2b) and real-time processing of biosignals data (R2c). The biosensor management layer facilitates the setting up, connection of, and recording of biosensor data via
Brownie. For this purpose, a standardized biosensor interface with basic functions such
as starting/stopping recording, and specifying locations for saving physiological data, was
incorporated into Brownie. The standardized interface can be extended for specifying and
configuring sensor-specific properties (such as sampling frequency, hardware connectivity
information for parallel port or Bluetooth properties).
Currently, implementations for recording ECG, EDA, PPG, EEG and eye-tracking data
have been completed, as well as recording of webcam data. The generic signal processing
layer of Brownie facilitates, for instance, real-time heart rate analysis for providing livebiofeedback. The modularity of the biosensor tier allows the implementation of new realtime monitoring and analyses methods (i.e. filtering methods, processing algorithms, and
post-processing algorithms).
Data synchronization is addressed in two different ways: the first way is where the
recording of all biosensor modalities are integrated into Brownie. Here, data is recorded
on one device (i.e. sensor associated with one experimental computer), all data is recorded
and timestamped using the same clock. Hence, there is no post-hoc synchronization necessary. The second way is where at least one biosensor modality is not recorded directly
within Brownie but recorded externally. Here, Brownie is used to record the behavioral
data of the experiment and simultaneously acts as a marker signal emitter for all connected biosensors (Hariharan et al., 2014). The marker signals can then be used for postprocessing synchronization of one or more modalities. In addition to those two ways,
timestamps for experiment events are always recorded with server and client time in order to enable post-hoc synchronization of multiple clients with the server time. These data
synchronization capabilities are within the requirements raised in the established NeuroIS
guidelines by Dimoka et al. (2010) and Léger et al. (2014), e.g., simultaneously obtaining

24

2.4 Design and Development
data from different sources and providing a marker signal emitter functionality. In order
to demonstrate the operability of the second iteration artefact, namely the biosensor tier,
the experimenters conducted three experiments 1, 2, and 3 (Table 2.1). The first two
experiments involved collecting large amounts of data (e.g. up to two hours of measurement for 9 clients at a sample rate of 1000 Hz with three different sensors simultaneously),
while experiment 3 included real-time signal processing. All three experiments verified the
feasibility of collecting physiological data using Brownie. In this phase, challenges faced
were with respect to the following: 1) Bluetooth driver compatibility, 2) Java versioning
and DLL (Dynamic Link Library) compatibility with various operating systems and sensor
devices, and 3) identifying processing speed requirements for real-time signal processing.
These challenges were later identified and accounted for prior to the experiment setup,
and appropriate solutions were integrated in Brownie.

2.4.3 Iteration 3: Preparation for Open-Source Usage
In the third iteration, Brownie and its support landscape were prepared for open-source
use within the NeuroIS community. This includes open-source distribution (R3b), a support infrastructure of instructions, tutorials and exemplary experiments (R4b), as well as
redistribution and replication (R4c) of Brownie and implemented experiments. In addition, the third iteration addressed further requirements identified in our literature review
(see Evaluation section) and in discussions with other experimenters (see Problem identification and requirement definition section) as well as in iterations 1 and 2, such as support
for website research (R3a), integration of multimedia content (R3e), and integration of
questionnaires (R4d).
Brownie is fully open source and licensed under the Apache 2.0 open source license with
the added requirement of a citation in case of academic use. The support infrastructure
includes a wiki with information about Brownie’s architecture, basic usage instructions,
and a FAQ section. These are complemented by a number of video tutorials that demonstrate how to set up existing experiments as well as how to implement a new experiment
on Brownie. Other video tutorials address specific questions commonly asked by experimenters (e.g., how to install JWindow Builder, how data logging on Brownie works, how
to match subjects to different treatments). With respect to redistribution, the database engine PL/SQL proved difficult to install separately. To reduce this step, we switched to the
database engine H2, to create a schema dynamically, without requiring separate creation
by the experimenter. Users are now able to add new values to be stored in the database

25

Chapter 2 Brownie: A platform for NeuroIS experiments
with minimal recreation efforts. Another step towards facilitating the redistribution and
replicability of experiments was making Brownie available on Bitbucket, and giving all
experimenters the opportunity to share their experimental code in the Bitbucket repository.
The result of the third iteration, a software artefact including its documentation and
support infrastructure, was tested in use cases 4, 5 and 6 (Table 2.1). The experiments
described in these use cases were created by external experimenters based on the documentation and support material.

2.4.4 Architecture Overview
In order to retain modularity, while abstracting functionality, we adopt a layered architecture for Brownie. Components of Brownie are segmented along two dimensions: i)
whether they are used at the server or on the client side, denoted within each component,
and ii) whether they are part of the built-in or the customizable tier. A detailed architecture
of the platform is given in Figure 2.2.

FIGURE 2.2: Platform Architecture

26

2.4 Design and Development

2.4.5 Built-in Tier
The built-in tier is the stable core of the platform. It is ready-to-use, and requires possibly
no (or minimal) alterations while designing an experiment. The built-in tier is composed
of four layers (i) the entity layer - or the object relation mapping layer; (ii) the data access object (DAO) layer - or the abstraction layer to access entity objects; (iii) the generic
server - encompassing functionalities of server; and (iv) the generic client - containing
functionalities to define behavior of clients. The first two layers can be modified to specify
changes in the schema, or to obtain different kinds of information from the schema. In
addition, the generic server and client layers can be used to manage the structure and
procedure of an experiment on the server side, and the communication rules and clientspecific properties on the client side. Details about the treatments (interfaces associated
with the treatment), sessions (session date, cohort size, membership and matching rules),
and within each session, the experiment sequence information (number of periods, pauses,
etc.) can be specified on the UI. A visualization of the built-in tier is given in Figure 2.3,
and the corresponding Java projects are described in Figure 2.4.

2.4.6 Customizable Experimental Tier
The customizable experimental tier is a separate Java project that facilitates implementation of new experiments. Each experiment thus consists of a client and a server side, with
the former implementing client screens, and the latter consisting of an implementation
of the server-side classes (Institution and Environment, Refer to wiki article on Description of architecture). Client screens can be developed using Java Swing, thus enabling
access to the extensive UI capabilities and support that Java provides. This aspect of the
architecture also facilitates portability to be used on any device that supports Java. For instance, controlled laboratory experiments of specific websites could be run by integrating
the BrowserObject in a Java applet (thus allowing NeuroIS experiments with websites).
Another instance, is that the experiment can be conducted on different mobile devices that
support Java applets. The platform is distributed with a working demonstration of the Ultimatum Game, a live-biofeedback experiment, and a browser experiment. Source codes
of the experiments in this document, are available upon request.

2.5 Evaluation

2.4.7 Customizable Biosensor Tier
The customizable biosensor tier consists of the sensor management and the live-biofeedback
layer (as a category of neuro-adaptive system). The sensor management layer facilitates
the setting up, connection and recording of sensor data via the experimental platform.
Currently, implementations for recording ECG, EDA, PPG, and EEG data are available.
In addition, the generic sensor recording layer of Brownie facilitates extension to use
other biosensors, depending on the individual requirement of the experiment. Hence,
it is possible to customize Brownie to use upcoming sensor technologies for experiments.
Also, the biosensor tier is integrated with a live-biofeedback module combined with the
sensor-analysis framework, xAffect, and performs real-time monitoring and analysis of
heart rate and skin conductance data. Brownie hence facilitates integrating existing livebiofeedback libraries for experiments as well as implementing new real-time monitoring
and analysis methods (i.e., filtering methods, processing algorithms, and post-processing
algorithms).

2.5 Evaluation
2.5.1 Evaluation by means of demonstrations and use cases
In order to evaluate Brownie, we adopt a combination of evaluation methods as specified
in Peffers et al. (2007): (i) an evaluation to confirm the solutions’ capability to meet the
specified requirements by means of observational methods (through case studies and scenarios in a business or research environment), (ii) an evaluation to identify benefits and
problems in the solution, by means of descriptive methods with respect to the artefact’s
utility, and (iii) an evaluation to demonstrate quality and efficiency of the platform using
well-executed evaluation plans, by means of descriptive methods.
The above three evaluation methods were iterated twice, once internally (by the developers of the platform), and once externally, by other experimenters. The first evaluation
of Brownie illustrates the platform’s use in two auction experiments (Expt. 1 and Expt.
2 in Figure 2.5). With Experiment 1, the capability of Brownie to meet the following requirements was confirmed: R1a, R1b, R2a, R3b, and R3c, R3e, R4d. With Experiment 2,
Brownie demonstrated ability to fulfill requirements R1a, R2a, R3b, R3c, R3d, R3e, and

29

Chapter 2 Brownie: A platform for NeuroIS experiments
R4d. The first iteration included observational and confirmatory evaluation by the developers of the platform. In order to meet R3a, a prototype of a browser experiment was
made available, which can be extended and used in an experimental setting. Brownie is
distributed via Bitbucket, a repository for code sharing, which experimenters can download by requesting access to the repository, hence fulfilling R4a. R4b is achieved by adding
documentations and discussing issues on Github, hence serving as a distribution, learning
and discussion forum for the platform. Finally, R4c is facilitated by the use of Eclipse’s Window Builder plugin, which allows for easy creation of GUI’s using drag-and-drop methods
on Swing.
The second evaluation iteration was carried out by presenting the platform to members
of two departments at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. These members conducted
ten different experiments with Brownie (Expt. 3 to 10 in Figures 2.5 and 2.6). The
demonstration of Brownie followed an iterative process that involved demonstration to
real experimenters as well as testing with student assistants. Feedback from experimenters
was incorporated as features, to enhance the existing functionalities of the platform. As
proposed by Peffers et al. (2007), this evaluation, based on the experimenters’ experiences,
contains a comparison of the initial objectives with the actual requirements of the artefact
(Table 2.1).

2.5.2 Evaluation of Requirements Based on a Literature Research
Next, we performed a thorough literature review of NeuroIS research in the Senior Scholars’ Basket of Eight journals, which conducted an experiment with neurophysiological measurements to inquire upon their research questions. To ensure independent assessment,
an evaluator who was not part of the developer team identified the requirements of the
NeuroIS experiments conducted in these papers. The evaluator then validated whether
Brownie meets these requirements or, if that was not the case, could be extended to do
so. The results of the literature review are presented in Figure 2.7. Requirements marked
as "fulfilled" are met by Brownie and have already been demonstrated as feasible in one
or more experiments. Requirements marked as "requiring extension" are technically feasible, but have not been demonstrated by means of experiments yet. The literature review
suggests that nearly all published NeuroIS experiments can be implemented in Brownie,

32

2.5 Evaluation

FIGURE 2.6: Screenshots of experiments implemented on Brownie - II

33

Chapter 2 Brownie: A platform for NeuroIS experiments
with the exceptions of Dimoka et al. (2010) and Riedl et al. (2010, 2014). These two
experiments would require extending Brownie to integrate fMRI measurements.
During this evaluation step, we identified two requirements commonly mentioned in
the surveyed NeuroIS papers, namely, integration of multimedia and questionnaires. Both
requirements are implemented in the current version of Brownie, but were not explicitly
noted as requirements in the original requirement list. Since the literature review showed
them to be important across several NeuroIS papers, we extended the requirement list accordingly. This evaluation also highlights that the requirement list for the platform reflects
the features required for conducting state of the art NeuroIS experiments, and will expand
with the development of NeuroIS research.

2.5.3 Evaluation of Requirements and Usability Based on a Case
Study
2.5.3.1 Case Study Description
The goals of our case study were twofold: (i) whether Brownie meets the requirements of
the experimenter and (ii) whether it achieves high usability for the experimenter as well as
the participants of the experiment. The case study describes a research project that begun
in March, 2015 which used Brownie and was broadly structured along the six essential
phases of the NeuroIS research framework introduced by vom Brocke and Liang (2014).
None of the developer team was involved in this project in any capacity. The project team
contacted the developer team a few times asking for access to the software and inquiring
about tutorials and support material for specific questions (see Case Study details). Two
chief investigators (referred to as CI1 and CI2) planned to investigate user engagement
on online participation platforms by comparing different crowdfunding mechanisms. CI1
had experience in programming with z-Tree, an alternative platform to Brownie (see Figure 1) while CI2 had minimal prior experience in programming (programming courses
only, with no experience in programming projects). Both CIs had experience in experimental research. The CIs worked with two student research assistants (RA1 and RA2) on
implementing their research project. Table 2 provides an overview of the data collected
from the key persons involved in this project during one or more of the above mentioned
six phases. We interviewed two participants of the experiment who were randomly drawn
from the participant pool. In total, the research project lasted approximately 6 months,
including all six research phases. The first two phases took up about 2 months, the implementation in Brownie (phase 3b) about 2.5 months, and conducting the experiment and
analyzing the data took about 1.5 months.

2.5.3.2 Phases 1 & 2: Identify Research Questions and Build the Theoretical
Foundation
In the first phase, the CIs identified the research questions for the project. First, they
planned to investigate whether the crowdfunding mechanism would influence participants’
behavior (RQ1). Second, they planned to examine whether interacting with a human or
a computer group would influence participants’ behavior and perceptions (RQ2). Third,
they were interested in the influence of the crowdfunding mechanisms on the intensity of

36

2.5 Evaluation
affective processes (RQ3). The CIs considered conducting an online study but discarded
this option because "given the specific subject of crowdfunding" and the novelty of the
approach, the CIs felt they needed the level of control provided by a lab experiment, with
the appropriate choice of treatments. The experiment was to be supplemented by questionnaires to gather additional data required to investigate the above questions.
In this phase, requirements R1a, R1b, R3c, and R4d were already clearly perceptible
to the CIs. CI2 explained that "We had to come up with a proprietary user interface, to
simulate a crowdfunding setting, which was able to incorporate a number of projects.
We wanted participants to see a progress bar (a graphical scale), and to be able to enter
information. In addition, we needed to track each and every participant move (or click).
We wanted a tool that enabled us to manage all participants to see the same screen and
information during a given lab session, as well as a software that allowed us to track the
timestamps of user activity. In addition, recording physiological data in the form of heart
rate, was necessary, to assess emotional processes without direct reports of participants."
In summary, participants needed to interact with the interface (R1a), be grouped differently (R1b), their every click had to be logged (R3c), and a questionnaire had to be
included (R4d). The CIs realized the need to gather physiological data in order to assess
affective processes during participants’ decision-making (R2a) towards the end of the conceptual phase. CI1 stated in the interview that one important issue was extending the
round-based experiment to one in which participants could dynamically view others’ actions, i.e. from a static experiment to one with a high level of real-time interaction. Hence,
extensibility (R3d) was stated as an important criterion for platform choice as well.

2.5.3.3 Phase 3a: Design of the Experiment
The CIs decided on a between-subject design with different interfaces for two treatments
(two crowdfunding mechanisms). With respect to group interaction (R1b), twelve participants were assigned to each session which in turn consisted of 24 periods. In each period,
participants were randomly assigned to two groups of six, with the restriction that two
participants would never be assigned to the same group twice. The design included three
phases, or screens (Information and Input, Round Result, Final Result) with interaction
elements, such as standard input boxes and buttons; and graphical elements, such as status bars, timer (ticking down from 60 seconds) and result tables. After each user input
phase, an arrow or a cross would indicate which projects were funded. Hence, a common

37

Chapter 2 Brownie: A platform for NeuroIS experiments
programming language which offered libraries for these elements, as well as supported
their future planned extensions, emerged as an auxiliary requirement of the experiment
(R3c) at this stage.
The CIs then turned to the question which platform would fulfill their requirements
best. Limesurvey offered the required questionnaire functionality but neither biosignal acquisition nor processing nor sufficient flexibility in interface and experimental flow design.
RA1 explained in their written feedback that, "[The] crowdfunding setting required a system that allowed us to specify detailed endowment rules and an advanced client-server
communication." z-Tree was considered as another option but, as CI1 pointed out in the
interview, "choosing [z-Tree] would not have enabled us to extend the experiment to a
real-time setting [R3d]." CI2 stated in the interview that using z-Tree would have required
them to drop R2 since it is currently not possible to acquire biosignal data in z-Tree. With
regard to interface design (R3c), CI1 considered both z-Tree and other candidate platforms
to be "limited in possibilities." CI1 and CI2 finally chose Brownie as their experimental platform since it fulfilled the primary requirements of the experiment (R1a, R1b, R2a, R2b,
R3d, R4c, and R4d). CI1 and CI2 stated that system usefulness, i.e. that the system would
meet all their requirements and be able to cope with their "special wishes," was initially
the most important criterion in choosing Brownie.

2.5.3.4 Phase 3b: Implementation of the Experiment
In Phase 3b, RA1 and RA2 implemented the design specifications. The CIs provided power
point slides for the screen designs, excel files for the group matching logic, screenshots of
whiteboard discussions, mock-ups, and textual descriptions. RA1 and RA2 were also involved in the CIs’ discussions. RA2 had basic programming skills, with prior experience
in Java from university courses. RA1 had advanced programming skills, having participated in programming projects before. Both CIs estimated that, from their experience, it
took them a normal amount of time (two weeks’ time) to find a student research assistant
reasonably fluent in Java, i.e. no longer than it would have taken to find a person with
command of another programming language. CI1 observed that, in the beginning of the
project, it was difficult to estimate the level of programming skills required for the project.
Due to the complexity of the experiment, as well as the overhead of learning to work with
a new platform, the CIs expected that they would run into difficulties implementing the
experiment. CI1 explained that "it would have been easier to find someone to program
for z-Tree, especially for simpler experiments, but not for programming our experiment -

38

2.5 Evaluation
which would have been a bigger challenge. z-Tree would have been useful for programming simpler settings, such as a standard public goods game, but for the crowdfunding
setting we wanted to examine, along with physiological measures, Brownie turned out
to be the better choice. In addition, on z-Tree, it is not possible to use common knowledge about programming, which makes one heavily dependent on the manual, whereas
on Brownie, we could find help for new ideas on online materials, very easily."
Based on feedback from CI1 and CI2, RA1 altered the implementation iteratively. RA2
worked 10 hours per week on the implementation, and 80 hours in total, including the
setup and learning time. The implementation phase consisted of the following four major
steps (S1-S4).
S1 - Installation and Setup (03/11/2015 - 03/13/2015): RA1 and RA2 requested
access to Brownie source code via email. The source code was distributed with links to
tutorials, sample experiments, and video tutorials. RA1 found the information easy to
understand and effective for installing Brownie, which points to a good information quality.
CI1 remarked that "it would be helpful to have more of these great tutorials, but it is a
good start ... " CI2 noted that it took more work than they had expected to install and
setup Brownie, to understand the various components, and the interaction between them.
However, as soon as a basic understanding was gained, they were able to make progress
much more easily. CI1 recalls that RA1 was "frustrated in the beginning, but then with the
video and online tutorials, they were able to set it up fast, and get it working," CI1 also
noted that they would expect this to be a problem with any new experimental tool to be
learnt.
S2 - UI and Client Screen Design (03/16/2015 - 04/15/2015): Based on the conceptual designs from Phase 3a, RA1 first designed the interfaces participants would interact
with. This took approximately 40 hours. During this period, RA1 asked questions about
how to quickly implement the GUI and the look-and-feel of client screens which the developer team answered by providing instructions for Window Builder and improving the
tutorials on how to implement the GUI with Window Builder. With respect to the interface
quality, RA1 stated in written feedback evaluation that, "After finding out how to do it, it is
neat to be able to design an attractive experiment (using the WindowBuilder for eclipse)
with Java."
S3 - Experiment Client-server Communication (04/23/2015-04/28/2015): RA1
proceeded with implementing the experimental flow, i.e. the ordering of displaying screens,
sending client-specific information from the server, incorporating round-based, client-level,

39

Chapter 2 Brownie: A platform for NeuroIS experiments
and group-level logic in the experiment. The developer team assisted in this step by pointing to current experiments as well as tutorials. RA1 stated as written feedback that "It was
rather easy to include and start the experiment with its server/client interfaces."
CI2 found that "incorporating message passing client-server interaction was relatively
easy," and CI1 did not "remember any problems in this step." The tutorials were considered particularly helpful for solving issues, which points to the fulfillment of R4b. CI2
commented on the information quality of the support material: "The information (such
as videos, documentation) provided with Brownie as well as online support in forums
was really helpful for finding the information required to complete the experiment." CI1
recommended for future work on Brownie that "the website’s search and overview functionality could be improved such that tutorials can be found faster." CI1 emphasized the
importance of R1a and R1b for their study design in written feedback: "The interaction
of groups across different cohorts was really important to us. Specifically, group contributions and funding had to be calculated for each of the four projects and displayed to all
participants. Brownie enabled us to achieve this."
In order to ensure that participants are not placed in the same group twice, the subject
group allocation for each round had to be fixed in the implementation, whilst ensuring
balanced treatments. The then existing features of Brownie (random vs. factorial) did
not include this function. The developer and experimenter teams discussed this issue, and
the developer team decided to extend Brownie to incorporate customized matching. It
is now available for all experiments. This special requirement demonstrates R3d, i.e. the
extensibility of the platform for a specific need. In their written feedback, RA1 commented
on system usefulness: "It was nice to have pretty much all the freedom and possibilities
anyone could ever ask for concerning the backend and which (matching) algorithms you
want to include."
S4 - Testing (05/18/2015-06/11/2015): This step was completed in several iterations
throughout the implementation process both in offline software testing and session testing
in the lab. CI1 stated that it took some effort to start multiple clients (12, in this case) on
the same system and test, but they managed to complete it successfully. CI2 stated that,
initially, setting up each computer in the lab separately was a bit inconvenient. However,
they later implemented a script based on a previous example for another experiment which
solved this issue and made lab testing very easy. This demonstrates the advantage of
using a common programming language (R3c), and the extensibility of the platform to
incorporate desirable standard features easily (R3d). Testing took approximately a quarter

40

2.5 Evaluation
of the overall development time of the research assistant (approximately 5 work days).
CI2 considered the tutorials, especially videos, to be "very helpful." CI2 would rate the
difficulty of learning to use Brownie as "intermediate" (taking easy, intermediate, and hard
as rating scale). CI1 found it more difficult to get a basic understanding of Brownie (see
Installation and Setup) but thought that, thereafter, it was quite easy to understand how
to adapt Brownie to different purposes and current and future research designs. In total,
with respect to the overall satisfaction, all team members stated a satisfaction level of 4
on a scale of 1 to 5. They said that difficulties in implementation were partly due to the
complexity of the experiment design, and partly due to insufficient documentation at the
beginning of their research project. Since then, support materials and tutorials have been
extended and elaborated: tutorials for all experiments are now publicly available.

2.5.3.5 Phase 4a: Conduct the Experiment and Collect Data
The study was conducted with twelve participants per session, and one session for each
treatment (24 participants in total). CI1 stated that, with respect to interface quality, they
were able to "...successfully and comfortably manage the flow of the experiment (such
as configuring sessions, viewing session and client statuses during run-time), as well as
programming additional elements (such as questionnaires), easily in the experiment using
Brownie." CI2 added that the "front end was really good, and we needed minimal help in
using it to manage the experiment. There were no issues during run-time of the session."
CI1 stated that they incorporated pre-experiment questionnaires without any difficulty.
Post-experiment questionnaires were collected via a separate Google forms website, which
was invoked from within Brownie, as part of the website integration functionality (R3a).
The advantage in invoking the Google form within Brownie was that - since the experiment
was running in full-screen mode - participants were prevented from wrongly clicking on
any other parts of the window, or closing the form accidentally.
In addition to behavioral data, the experimenters also collected ECG and EDA data using the Bioplux (2007) sensor system, which was transmitted using Bluetooth and stored
on the individual participant’s PC, thus demonstrating fulfillment of R2a. CI2 stated that
"Brownie gave us the opportunity to log any user event in the experiment and synchronize
them with the physiological data with the required timestamp information," thus demonstrating R2b. They were able to complete the experiment successfully, and integrate data
for their analysis. This demonstrates fulfillment of R3a (integration of websites) and R4d

41

Chapter 2 Brownie: A platform for NeuroIS experiments
(implementation of questionnaires). CI1 emphasized that the flexibility aspect (to incorporate new ideas) was the most satisfying aspect of programming with Brownie, and they
felt "limitless" in terms of what they would be able to implement in their project. RA1
summarized in the written feedback, "All in all, Brownie worked as we wanted it to."
CI1 added that Brownie matched their expectations with respect to system usefulness and
overall satisfaction.
In order to gauge the participants’ views in using the interfaces implemented in Brownie,
we interviewed two experiment participants (EP1 and EP2) to obtain qualitative feedback
on the usability of the platform. EP1 had already taken part in experiments on z-Tree and
Brownie before that had been set in similar group interaction scenarios. EP1 stated that the
experiment interface was self-explanatory and easy to interact with, due to its clear structure. They felt absorbed in the experiment but would have liked to avoid "uninteresting"
waiting times while other participants were finishing their respective tasks. These waiting
times were due to the CIs’ decision to go with a round-based design; they indicated in
the interview that they plan on changing to a dynamic design in a follow-up experiment.
EP1 did not discern any visible differences between using interfaces programmed with
Brownie or other platforms. The participant suggested that incorporating a chat function
would have enabled communication with other participants. Although a client-to-client
communication feature is available in Brownie, the CIs had decided against enabling it in
order to maintain a higher level of experimental control. Comparing two experimental
interfaces implemented on Brownie (both of which the participant had taken part in), EP1
rated the satisfaction level of the crowdfunding experiment as 4, on a scale of 1 to 5 and
the interface of the other experiment as 5. That interface had contained real-time elements
(such as live charts and trends, also implemented in Brownie), which appealed more to the
participant. EP1 had taken part in another experiment with physiological measurements
before, and found the overall experimental interface to be engaging.
EP2 had not taken part in an experiment with Brownie before, but in several experiments with z-Tree. They found participating in the crowdfunding experiment interesting,
and thought it felt real to an extent. EP2 felt that this was one of the "better" experiments
they had participated in so far, that the interface was absorbing and fun, and that they
were not bored during the experiment. Comparing Brownie with z-Tree, EP2 stated that
the structure of the crowdfunding experiment was comparable (information, decision, and
result). They observed that - compared to previous experiments on z-Tree - loading time
of experiment screens, especially those with a lot of information, was much shorter. In
the previous experiments, they had found the long loading times of such screens rather

42

2.5 Evaluation
tedious. On a scale of 1 to 5, EP2 rated the satisfaction level of the crowdfunding experiment as 5. In summary, the above statements point to a satisfactory and engaging interface
quality of the participant screens.

2.5.3.6 Phase 4b: Analyze Data
With respect to flexibility of user data logging (R3b) and system usefulness, RA1 stated
in written feedback that, "[Brownie was] used for data storage, and data storage methods
used in previous experiments were useful examples to easily integrate these in our experiment," and also that "the pre-defined database helped a lot," referring to the underlying
database schema of Brownie designed for easy querying and re-organizing of experimental
data. In particular, client data was stored by concatenating relevant user values (e.g. input
and click data) along with the respective client timestamps in the central server database.
To retrieve more information on different granularities like subjects, round, group-level
join queries were used. This increased system usefulness in terms of flexibility of data
storage. CI1 said that "... (working with) normal (i.e. observed data about participant
behavior) data was no problem. Brownie further enabled the synchronization of physiological data, with the events of the experiment, by adding timestamp entries. These
time-synced event entries were later useful for analysis of physiological data. However,
physiological data extraction can be improved." CI1 specifically suggested reducing the
steps necessary for transformation and analysis of the stored raw physiological values.

2.5.3.7 Phases 5 & 6: Interpret the Experimental Data and Discuss the Results
The CIs proceeded to analyze the experimental data, and publish their findings in suitable outlets. In future sessions, they plan to store real-time processed physiological data
in addition to the raw data. CI1 observed that, "in all our decisions, we never came to
a point where we could not do something because it was not possible on the platform.
There was always a solution, and this was a very positive aspect for us." CI2 gave as their
opinion that, "[Brownie] is an excellent alternative to z-Tree. The possibility to include
physiological measurements is really important, since they help understand participant
behavior greatly." CI1 considered physiological data to be "honest" - in terms of showing
whether participants were aroused, annoyed, or bored during an experiment. Both CIs
were of the opinion that integration of physiological measures would be extremely useful for upcoming studies in the IS domain. If CI2 were to do another experiment, they

43

Chapter 2 Brownie: A platform for NeuroIS experiments
would "implement it with Brownie." CI1 and CI2 stated that they did not notice a marked
difference to other platforms while conducting their experiment, since the core building
blocks (such as session, treatment, and periods) were similar to other platforms they used
before. In future research, they plan to extend their experiment by new treatment levels.
This demonstrates fulfillment of R4c, i.e. the replicability of an experiment using Brownie,
and also demonstrates the overall satisfaction with Brownie, emphasized by CI1’s statement that "I would be comfortable to design and create my next planned experiments in
Brownie, and I would recommend it to other researchers." The CIs also stated, with the
benefit of hindsight, that the quality of the available information played a large role in
helping them to successfully complete their project.

2.5.4 Evaluation of Usability Based on an Experimental Study
2.5.4.1 Experimental Study Description
We evaluated the usability of Brownie for experimenters by conducting a laboratory study
to compare Brownie to the current gold-standard in software for behavioral experiments,
z-Tree. The study task consisted in altering a provided Ultimatum Game to a Trust Game.
Specifically, participants had to change the experimental logic (1) and the interface (2),
add player pictures (3), a reputation score (4), and include biosensor measurements (5).
The Ultimatum Game is a two-person game in which the first player (the requester) receives a sum of money and proposes how to divide the sum between himself and another
player. In the Trust Game, the differences are that the responder will be given a choice how
much of the now-tripled money to send back to the requester. We chose this setting because, since the Ultimatum Game (Joe and Lin, 2008) and the Trust Game have been used
for understanding peer-to-peer interaction and trusting behavior in online environments
(Riedl et al., 2014; Dimoka et al., 2011; Gefen and Pavlou, 2012).

2.5.4.2 Procedure
The study was carried out in a within-subject design, where a participant would implement the experiment in both Brownie and z-Tree. The two treatment sessions (Brownie
and z-Tree) took place in two subsequent weeks, at the same time of day and the same
laboratory. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the treatments in the first week,
and alternated to the other treatment in the second week.

44

2.5 Evaluation
The study proceeded as follows. First, participants were given general instructions on
the study task. Second, they filled in a pre-study questionnaire on their programming
abilities. Third, they received a tutorial explaining the Ultimatum and Trust Game rules,
how the Ultimatum Game was implemented in the software, and which changes were
necessary to alter it into a Trust Game. In order to ensure that the depth of the instructions,
and the information on the tutorials for both platforms were comparable, the same tutorial
was adapted for the other platform, and modifications were made only with respect to the
platform-specific terms, while retaining the task descriptions and modifications. The study
task was divided into eight subtasks. After each subtask, participants were given a short
questionnaire on how difficult they felt the task had been. After the last task, participants
were given a final questionnaire asking for their overall usability evaluation of the software.
We measured usability with the IBM usability scale (Lewis, 1995). Participants were on
a time limit of 120 minutes. Prior to the study, we estimated the time required for each
subtask by way of timing 6 student assistants with no or limited prior experience with
Brownie and z-Tree and averaging their results.

2.5.4.3 Measures
Task scores were assigned based on successful lines of code which were functionally correct
for performing the given task. Each task was hence broken down into 3 or 4 code alterations, which were specified for both platforms. The degree of task completion was scored
by two independent researchers based on the solution code submitted by participants. For
measuring usability, three factors from the IBM usability scale were used, namely System
Usefulness, Information Quality, and Interface Quality. Confirmatory factor analysis with
R-3.3.2 and lavaan 0.5-20 showed good model fit.

2.5.4.4 Sample
We invited students from a course on experimental methods in business research, in order
to ensure that all participants had a basic understanding of and a general interest in experiments and experimental research, of which 28 students participated. For participation in
the usability study, students were awarded by means of course credit points. The study was
carried out in the experimental lab at [blinded for review]. Prior to our study, the Ultimatum Game had been briefly explained within the scope of the course, the Trust Game had
not. Experimental platforms had not been discussed in the course up to this point. 25%

45

Chapter 2 Brownie: A platform for NeuroIS experiments
of participants were female, and students were pursuing their Master’s degree. Average
session duration was 1:33 hours in Brownie, and 1:26 hours in z-Tree.

2.5.4.5 Results
Figure 2.8 shows the average task scores of our participants on z-Tree and Brownie, indicating how well they solved each task. Task 8, the configuration of biosensors, was
unique to Brownie. Our results indicate that, on average, participants performed better
on Brownie, with the exception of tasks 4 (adding Responder logic to interface) and 7 (accessing experimental data). Taking the results by session, participants performed better
in both platforms in the second session (completion rates increased from the first session
by 19% in Brownie, and 10% in z-Tree), which can be explained by learning effects about
the study task.

FIGURE 2.8: Task completion rates for Brownie and z-Tree
Our results show that Brownie compares well to z-Tree; participants rated it as good as
z-Tree in both overall usability and all three usability sub-scales (Figure 2.9). Mean and
median ratings of all scales were lower for both platforms in the second session, but not
significantly so.

46

2.5 Evaluation
Y-axis indicates usability ratings aggregated across subjects, platforms, and on two different days, on a scale of 1-7. Smaller box plots indicate higher agreement within subjects,
which is observed in the case of z-Tree in Day 1, and Brownie for Day 2. Differences between the groups were not visible, denoting comparable usability. Long lower (upper)
whiskers indicate that participants varied more over the lower (upper) quartile of the usability score.

FIGURE 2.9: Usability scores for Brownie and z-Tree
In an open feedback question at the end of the second sessions, participants were asked
to indicate whether they would prefer to use Brownie or z-Tree in the future. 12 par-

47

Chapter 2 Brownie: A platform for NeuroIS experiments
ticipants indicated a preference for Brownie, citing reasons such as flexibility, common
programming language, open-source, and more intuitive programming. 8 participants
preferred z-Tree because they found it easier to understand. 6 participants did not express
a preference, and 2 participants explicitly noted that they were unable to decide, stating
that they found Brownie more flexible and powerful but z-Tree easier to get started with.
Taken as a whole, the results of the experiment show that, in terms of usability Brownie
is comparable to the current used software z-Tree, while considering common aspects of
experiments (such as experiment logic and UI modification). At the same time, Brownie
offers additional NeuroIS-specific features which are currently not available in z-Tree (R2a,
R2b, R2c), as well as possibilities for further extension (R3a, R3c, R3d, R4a). The requirement list identified earlier in the chapter has been confirmed by the literature review, as
well as the case study. Hence, we conclude that, Brownie meets emerging requirements
of NeuroIS research and cognate areas, which are not fulfilled by current platforms, and
is usable to implement NeuroIS and cognate experiments.

2.6 Contribution and Discussion
In Chapter 2, we describe Brownie, a stable platform for implementing user interaction
experiments with neurophysiological measurements and strategic interaction scenarios.
In terms of dissemination and communication, the source code for the platform is distributed as a ready-to-use eclipse workspace project, with version controlling enforced
through the use of Github. The source code is available along with a Wiki with a setup
tutorial, a quick start guide, and a step-by-step guide to program and manage an experiment. In addition, video demonstrations on "How to setup Brownie", and "How to
Setup an Experiment", are made available at the following URL (https://bitbucket.org/kitiism/experimenttool/wiki/Home). The URL also contains the API, which describes the interrelationship between the various projects and classes in Brownie. Finally, the research
purpose behind the platform is communicated by means of scientific articles.
Addressing the design objective stated at the beginning of the chapter, we herewith
identify requirements to be fulfilled by a potential platform for conducting NeuroIS research in the lab. The platform is hence developed iteratively, by first identifying preliminary requirements, and then using evaluations to develop and identify further requirements. At the current stage of the project, there exists a small active community of users

48

2.7 Limitations and Future Work
of Brownie, that develops experiments, improves the framework, and provides necessary
tutorials and support required for new users. While the platform core is expected to be
stable, it is possible to modify and extend the framework as per the requirements of the
individual researcher.

2.7 Limitations and Future Work
This research has several limitations. First, in its current form Brownie does not allow
direct integration of available neuroimaging techniques (such as fMRIs, or PET). Such
imaging techniques predominantly use Python, Matlab, or C++ for data acquisition and
Matlab for further analyses. One possible solution would be providing suitable wrappers to
the other languages in order to facilitate communication with a broader range of sensors,
which is possible in Java. The existing implementations of live-biofeedback are based on
heart rate and skin conductance sensors, and ought to be enhanced in terms of efficiency
and real-time aspects of live-biofeedback, and in terms of other sensors that can be used
to compute LBF, such as PPG, EMG, etc.
Second, design science problem is conceptualized by means of the proposed requirement set. Although we attempt to present a design artefact, evaluate it, and provide directions for further development, the requirement set may also be validated by means of other
design instantiations (Gregor and Hevner, 2013). These instantiations could adopt a different design artefact for each requirement, such as choosing a different language for the
implementation. Other design instantiations may arise as a result of further experiments
conducted with Brownie, or by replicating existing experiments in different geographical
or cultural contexts.
Third, the real-time signal processing capabilities in Brownie are based on heart rate
and skin conductance sensors. The processors used to compute the respective features
ought to be enhanced in terms of efficiency and real-time aspects, and in terms of extensibility to other sensors, such as PPG, EMG, and EEG (Pope et al., 1995). The modular
architecture of Brownie facilitates extensions of the real-time features, such as different
manifestation of live-biofeedback, altering and adapting the interface based on neuroinformation, etc. In addition, integration with statistical and data analysis modules, such
as R-packages, would make it possible to perform the analysis of experimental data within

49

Chapter 2 Brownie: A platform for NeuroIS experiments
the platform environment, if required. These analysis modules could enable building individual variances in real-time sensor-data processing, based on gender, age, or historical
data of participants.
Finally, with the proliferation of mobile devices and the variety of tasks being performed
on them, NeuroIS experiments would need to be conducted across different devices, to understand user engagement with mobile devices (Bhandari et al., 2015; Hollingsworth and
Randolph, 2015). Brownie currently does not support experiments with mobile applications, and in the future, it could be extended to incorporate experiments applying NeuroIS
methods with mobile applications and sensors.

2.8 Conclusion
Brownie serves as a solution that meets emerging requirements for conducting NeuroIS
research. At present, the effort and technical knowledge required to conduct NeuroIS research are substantial. With this platform, we aim to help reduce both to a better manageable level. We also attempt to provide a high degree of flexibility with regards to individual
experimenters’ needs, specifically extensibility to emerging NeuroIS methodologies and
scalability across various devices. We hope that Brownie contributes to future research in
individual and group interactions in the lab by leveraging existing and emerging NeuroIS
methods for user interaction research, and fosters research collaboration across cognate
domains.
In the following chapters, we will now raise and examine specific NeuroIS research
questions, which also serve as instantations of how Brownie may be used for behavioral
research. The first study was implemented on z-tree (Chapter 3), and the second and third
studies were implemented on Brownie (Chapters 4 and 5).

Emotion regulation and behavior in

We cannot tell what may happen to us in the strange

really counts in the end.

3.1 Introduction
External events and stimuli are circumstances that shape our behavior and decisions (Bechara
and Damasio, 2005). As stated in the epigraph, we often may not be able to regulate or
decide the occurrence of external events, which decide our course of action. However,
such events, more often than not, cause changes in our emotional state, thus impacting subsequent behavior, positively or negatively. The extent to which these emotional
changes impact our subsequent behavior, depends to a large extent on the way we regulate emotions, and the degree to which we are able to regulate their impact, consciously
or subconsciously. This ability to influence how we can take what happens to us, may be
formally termed as emotion regulation. Theoretically, there exists several emotion regulation strategies. In this chapter, we focus on two such strategies, namely suppression and

51

Chapter 3 Emotion regulation and behavior in trading: to sell or to keep
reappraisal, and study the impact of external events, namely gains and losses, on emotions
and trading decisions.
Recent literature in decision-making and behavioral economics reveals that a large segment of investors, when dealing with situations of probabilities and higher valuations,
does not maximize their expected outcomes in decisions (Kahneman, 2003). The expectedutility theory (EUT) serves as a benchmark model for decision-making under risk (Bernoulli,
1954). Briefly summarizing, the model assumes that people choose between alternative
courses of action by assessing the desirability or utility of each action’s possible outcomes
and linearly weighing those utilities by their probability of occurring. Having said this,
several theories dealing with generalizations of EUT are however context dependent, and
struggle to provide a satisfactory explanation for the observed behavior, as predicted by
Huck and Weizsäcker (1999). Many of these theories do not take into account that investors’ behavior often deviates from decisions that maximize the expected value of a decision, possibly due to difficulties in determining the probability of occurring (hence the
risk) and expected monetary profit of each decision in the "real world."
In this context, the influencing role of emotional arousal and their regulation has been
recognized in recent research on decision-making, to explain and account for these deviations. Rick and Loewenstein (2007) coined the term integral emotions, which arise
from thinking about the consequences of one’s decision, and which are experienced at the
moment of choice. For instance, while deciding whether to buy or sell a stock, a person
might experience immediate fear at the thought of the stock’s losing value, and hence opt
for a different strategy than the one that maximizes his/her expected value. While the
role of integral emotions has been identified, several individual differences exist in these
theories as well. To this end, differences in the way people regulate emotions has started
to emerge as an explanation. For instance, Heilman et al. (2010) report that the effects of
integral emotion on decisions vary according to the manner in which a person regulates
the emotion experience, and this determines his/her performance in a given task. People who cognitively change a situation’s meaning in a way that alters its affective impact
(reappraisers) were found to display increased risk taking, by reappraising negative emotions associated with risk. Another strategy is by modulating responses after they occur
by influencing physiological, experiential, or behavioral responses as directly as possible.
Suppression falls under this category, and people who are predominantly suppressors, for
instance, were shown to exhibit the same level of risk aversion, since suppression was ineffective in regulating negative emotions. Hence, it appears that the emotion regulation
(ER) strategy employed by a person is likely to determine how affect is experienced as well

52

3.1 Introduction
as processed, to arrive at a decision. It is this intriguing interrelationship that we attempt
to examine in this chapter.
RQ1: In an individual context, do emotion-regulation strategies moderate the role
of integral arousal on EV-maximizing behavior, particularly in dealing with the external influences of gains and losses?
Explicitly stated, in a trading context, we ascertain whether ER influences the level of
integral arousal, measured by physiological responses. If so, does ER moderate the impact of integral arousal on EV-maximizing behavior? The first set of hypotheses hence
tests whether reappraisal/suppression strategies correspond to differences in experienced
arousal level, and moderate arousal to increase/decrease EV-maximizing behavior. Second,we test the same set of hypotheses, but under the premise that a gain/loss has been
experienced (correspondingly, a positive or a negative affect). In order to do this, we
conducted a laboratory experiment in which subjects participated in a complete information path-independent repeated stock-trading game. After observing the stock’s first price
change the subject decides whether to hold or sell the stock, and then receives one trend
update after this decision. During the experiment, subjects’ emotional arousal, which occur in the course of the decision process, is recorded by physiological parameters such as
skin conductance response (SCR) and heart rate (HR) which are well-established proxies
for affective processing (Dawson et al., 2011). Questionnaires were employed to measure
ER strategies (Gross, 2007) and risk attitudes (Holt and Laury, 2002).
The results show that subjects applying cognitive reappraisal experience lower levels
of integral arousal (measured by HR and SCR), whereas suppressors experienced higher
levels of SCR. Secondly, reappraisers were significantly less affected by emotional arousal,
to exhibit more EV-maximizing behavior. A similar effect has however not been observable for subjects who applied suppression strategy. Thirdly, after experiencing losses (and
gains), reappraisers experienced lesser levels of arousal (SCR and HR), whereas suppressors exhibited an increased level of arousal (SCR) after gains and losses. Finally, applying
the strategy of reappraisal, particularly after experiencing a loss, related to an increased
number of EV-maximizing choices. This effect was not visible in the case of experiencing
gains. Also, applying a suppression strategy did not moderate the impact of arousal on
EV-maximizing behavior, for gains or losses. The findings of this chapter implicate that
reappraisers not only experience lower levels of arousal, but adopting a reappraisal strategy has a positive impact in maximizing expected value of a decision, and additionally so,
after experiencing a loss. Therefore, cognitively altering the impact of a consequentialist

53

Chapter 3 Emotion regulation and behavior in trading: to sell or to keep
decision appears to be effective in decision-making, whereas strategies that hide or ignore
the emotion may not be equally effective.
The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows: We first summarize existing
research on the influence of emotional arousal and individual ER strategies on decisionmaking and trading. From these foundations we derive the hypotheses, followed by the
experimental design of the study. The results of the experiment are then presented, followed by conclusion and discussion of the findings.

3.2 Theoretical Background
In order to study deviations from EV-maximizing behavior, both information on probability
of winning and valuations, albeit fundamental are essential to incorporate. We begin with
two properties of a stock, in defining what would be expected behavior under the EUT. We
then seek to understand how and why subjects’ ER strategies play a role in their emotional
arousal levels, and when they deviate from expected behavior. In the following, we lay
down the theoretical background with respect to emotional arousal and emotion regulation
strategies, and their influences in decision-making.

3.2.1 Emotional Arousal in Decision-making
Many models in decision theory assume that agents, or decision-makers maximize their
expected utility taking the impact of context-specific factors into consideration, such as
probability of occurrence, and valuation. They evaluate all possible states and actions independent of whether these states will be reached or not and solve the game by backward
induction (Fudenberg, 2006). This means that the behavior of an agent or a user is assumed to be not affected by events that might occur, such as gains or losses. Rather, all
possible contingencies are dealt with by a complete plan of action that is made up prior to
the start of the decision-making context (such as an auction) and remains unaffected by
its actual course (Adam et al., 2011).
Usually, an emotion is triggered in response to an emotionally competent stimulus
(Bechara and Damasio, 2005), i.e. a particular object or event associated with a subjective significance, such as experienced gains or losses. Taking these into account, defining

54

3.2 Theoretical Background
EUT might hence not be the complete picture in trying to understand economic behavior, since it does not take these gains and losses into account, and neither the emotions
elicited by these events. The role of emotions in economic behavior (as prescribed by EUT)
has recently become a subject of wide debate (Bechara and Damasio, 2005; Humphrey,
2004). Rick and Loewenstein (2007) presented innovations to the EUT by involving the
influence of expected and immediate emotions in risky decision-making. To elucidate further, expected emotions are those that are anticipated to occur as a result of the outcomes
associated with different possible courses of action. The key feature of expected emotions
is that they are experienced when the outcome of a decision materializes, but not at the
moment of choice. Immediate emotions, in contrast, are experienced at the moment of
choice, falling into one of two categories: integral and incidental. Integral emotions arise
from thinking about the consequences of one’s decision. Incidental emotions arise from
sources objectively unrelated to the task at hand (e.g., being disturbed due to loud music
played elsewhere). Of these, it is likely that integral arousal impacts the course of behavior
in a decision-making context, since it is both related to, and occurs prior to the decision.
Hence, as a proxy for integral arousal, physiological measurements were performed at
events where integral arousal is likely to be triggered.
Numerous research works draw upon integral arousal (using physiological measurement) in order to study economic decision-making. For instance, SCRs were measured in
subjects involved in a gambling task (Bechara, 1997), and the results indicate that anticipation of the more risky outcomes led to higher SCRs than of the less risky ones. When
gambles that involve possible gains are presented one at a time most people display an
appeal towards the gambles. This phenomenon of gaining satisfaction directly from the
riskiness of the situation has been termed as the attraction to chance, and of suffering
dissatisfaction directly from the riskiness of the situation, repulsion from chance (Albers
et al., 2000). Adam and Kroll (2012) established through experiments with physiological
measurements that attraction to chance can be indicated by differences in arousal based on
the choices made by people for different types of lotteries. Adam et al. (2011) showed that
arousal as measured through HR mediates the influence of time pressure on bids in Dutch
auctions, also validated in the case of computerized agents in Teubner et al. (2015). Yet
another instance is of Astor et al. (2013) who showed in first-price sealed bid auctions that
higher valuations yield stronger responses in HR and SCR than lower valuations. Since
emotions have shown to be correlated to both the fundamental factors (of risk and valuations), and can be measured by means of SCR & HR, physiological measurements at
specific events before the decision are employed to test the hypotheses in this study.

3.2.2 Emotion Regulation
An emotion implies action tendency, i.e., the urge to execute a particular action (Frijda,
1988). However, whether or not an action tendency results in action, depends heavily on
the regulation phase, wherein the consequences of executing an action tendency are evaluated (Frijda, 1987). This regulation phase depends both on an individual’s ER capabilities
and on the intensity of emotion. If the intensity of emotion is very strong, the individual
may surpass "regulation thresholds" or "points of no return" (Frijda, 1987) and hence have
lesser control over the influence of emotional arousal on his/her actions (Loewenstein,
1996). On the other hand, if the individual were conscious of experiencing an emotion,
the chances are higher that he/she is able to control the influence of emotional arousal
on behavior, inspite of the intensity. Hence, theoretically, the very experience of emotion
seems to be heavily influenced by this regulatory mechanism, and dictates to what intensity
(arousal), and in which direction (valence), an emotion is expressed.
Given their more ancient role in decision-making, Panksepp (1998, 2005)’s framework
posits that the affective aspects of a stimulus are processed before and independently of
any cognitive aspects. Berridge and Winkielman (2003) report evidence for the idea of
unconscious emotion alone (for instance, unconscious liking), without any cognitive influences. In this work, we adopt the theoretical framework of reference as suggested by
Walla and Panksepp (2013): although unconscious processing also occurs when related
to emotion, it needs to be distinguished from the concept of emotion, which denotes the
output of information processing. What’s unconscious here should be rather termed as
"affective information processing"1 . Raw affective information is able to elicit more than
just one emotion, which can even be differently valenced. However, affective processing
also occurs in the absence of emotion generation. Finally, emotions are principally independent from cognition. Cognition, is regarded as a separate, parallel function, which can
synergize with as well as interfere with affective information processing.
It has been shown that regulating emotional arousal is dependent on the innate qualities
and regulation strategies that a person (consciously or unconsciously) employs. Gross and
John (2003) illustrates methods that can be employed to identify these individual characteristics. Here, two types are distinguished: reappraisal and suppression. Reappraisal
occurs and intervenes before emotion response tendencies have been fully generated, referred to as an antecedent focused strategy (Gross, 1998). It pertains to cognitively chang1

Note that this is slightly different to Bechara and Damasio (2005), whose definition states that an
emotion is triggered in response to an emotionally competent stimulus

56

3.2 Theoretical Background
ing a situation’s meaning in a way that alters its affective impact. Employing reappraisal
strategy has thus shown to efficiently alter the entire subsequent emotion trajectory, especially when down-regulating negative emotion. For instance, thinking about the positive
side of a negative incident or putting it into the broader context, might alter the intensity
as well as the experience of a negative affect. Reappraisal might hence be an adaptive
strategy that reduces negative affect, and in some contexts also decreasing the level of
physiological arousal (Delgado et al., 2008; Sokol-Hessner et al., 2009).
In contrast, suppression comes relatively late in the emotion-generative process, and
modifies the behavioral aspect of emotion response tendencies, referred to as a response
focused strategy (Gross, 1998). Suppression refers to influencing physiological, experiential, or behavioral responding as directly as possible. Suppression could also refer to efforts
to hide what one is feeling, or attempts to inhibit what one is feeling. Use of suppression
was shown to be correlated with increased negative affect, poorer recovery from changes in
negative affect, and decreased self-efficacy for managing future emotions (Gross, 2002).
How are these regulating strategies relevant to the role of emotions in economic behavior? Recent evidence illustrates that effective ER can reduce loss aversion and therefore
be beneficial for decision-making (Sokol-Hessner et al., 2009). Barrett (2007) showed
that due to their enhanced ability to differentiate emotions and to control their biases,
investors were able to achieve better decision-making performance. Thus, whether emotions enhance or deteriorate decision-making performance is likely to be moderated by
whether people are able to identify emotions as a first step, and then whether they are
able to regulate them, and if so by which method.
Moving to another specific example, Heilman et al. (2010) elucidates that upon inducing the emotions of fear and disgust, reappraisers reported reduced negative affect and
this was associated with reduced risk taking and increased task performance (by achieving higher scores in the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, BART). This suggests that reappraisal
aids to decrease the role of negative affect and improves performance in a given task,
in comparison to suppressors, where the latter was not observed. By means of BloodOxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) contrast imaging, Martin and Delgado (2011) also illustrate that cognitive control over affective response can modulate neural responses, and promote more goal-directed decision-making (reduced risk taking). Fenton-O’Creevy et al.’s
(2011) qualitative study summarizes opinions and interviews with traders, that successful and profitable trading was in fact associated with more sophisticated techniques for
regulating one’s own affective state. Hence, it appears that ER plays a vital role in deter-

57

Chapter 3 Emotion regulation and behavior in trading: to sell or to keep
mining whether a person’s emotional arousal impacts his/her behavior. However, is has
not yet been investigated, whether (i) ER strategies increase or decrease the influence of
(measured) emotional arousal, in the context of EV-maximizing behavior, and (ii) to what
extent the influence of emotional arousal on behavior is in turn moderated by ER strategies.
We hence investigate whether applying an ER strategy (of reappraisal/suppression) moderates the role of emotional arousal, and leads to (enhanced/decreased) EV-maximizing
behavior. To this end, the first two hypotheses can be stated as follows:
Hypothesis 1.1: Applying reappraisal strategies (a) corresponds to lower experienced arousal level and (b) moderates the role of integral arousal on EV-maximizing
behavior, leading to more EV-maximizing behavior.
Hypothesis 1.2: Applying suppression strategies (a) corresponds to lower experienced arousal level and (b) moderates the role of integral arousal on EV-maximizing
behavior, leading to less EV-maximizing behavior.
We next turn to the distinction between positive and negative emotions, and the role
they are likely to play in determining EV-maximizing behavior. Previous studies have
shown that happiness reduces risk aversion, whereas negative emotions such as fear increases risk aversion. Specifically, Lerner and Keltner (2001) reported that while fearful
people expressed pessimistic risk estimates and risk-averse choices, angry people expressed
optimistic risk estimates and risk-seeking choices. Loewenstein (2000) documented that
during risky decision-making, negative feelings (i.e., fear, dread, or anxiety) towards risk
tend to dominate positive feelings. Hence, it is possible that negative feelings are dealt
with differently, especially when the factor of risk is involved, thus suggesting the role of
ER strategies. Indeed, measuring the extent to which participants experienced positive and
negative emotions, Gross and John (2003) show that reappraisers experience and express
greater positive and less negative affect, whereas suppressors experience and express less
positive emotion. Heilman et al. (2010) takes these concepts together and, by means of
self-reported emotions and the BART, establishes that participants who reappraised their
negative affect displayed increased risk taking and increased task performance. However,
the direction in which ER strategies moderate the influence of emotion, specifically distinguishing between positive and negative emotions, on behavior is not certain. To the best
of our knowledge, there is no study that investigates the moderating role of ER strategy
on experienced gains or losses, and how these alter the course of EV-maximizing behavior.
The second set of hypotheses can be stated as follows:
Hypothesis 1.3: Given a loss (gain), applying reappraisal strategies (a) reduces

58

3.3 Method
(increases) the level of arousal experienced and (b) moderates the role of integral
arousal leading to increased (decreased) EV-maximizing behavior.
Hypothesis 1.4: Given a loss (gain), applying suppression strategies (a) increases
(reduces) the level of arousal experienced and (b) moderates the role of integral
arousal leading to decreased (increased) EV-maximizing behavior.

3.3 Method
In order to investigate the above hypotheses, we employed a within-subject 2x2 factorial
experimental design with a repeated trading decision scenario. Each subject participated
in one practice round and 15 rounds of trading. In each trading round, the subject is endowed with four stocks, picked randomly in subsequent order. Each of these trials was
then structured as follows: The participant started with an initial endowment of €100,
and was provided with complete information on probability of price increase (PROB),
and valuations (VAL), i.e., the expected amount of gain/loss, with two treatment levels
each. These treatment levels for PROB and VAL were in accordance with previous studies
(Loewenstein et al., 2008). We restricted to two levels each, in order to ensure a higher
number of data points per treatment, as required of physiological experiments. Possible price increases were either €2 or €10, hitherto labelled as VAL_LOWER (€2) and
VAL_HIGHER (€10); and probabilities of price increase were either 0.45 or 0.55, hitherto labelled as PROB_LOWER (0.45) or PROB_HIGHER (0.55). Table 3.1 summarizes
the treatment structure.

Chapter 3 Emotion regulation and behavior in trading: to sell or to keep
Based on stock information and the trend after one period, the subject then decided
whether to hold or sell the endowed stock. After this decision, the stock’s trend was shown
for one more period, and if the subject held (sold) the stock after the first update, the second (first) update was counted in for the payoff in that trial. The stock was automatically
sold after these two price updates. Appendix B illustrates the screenshots of the interface
and the final trading screen. At the end of the experiment, exactly one trial was chosen by
the subject by rolling a dice twice: once to choose the round number (1-15), and once to
choose the stock (1-4). The profit in this trial was paid out in cash after the experiment.
A trading decision scenario is described by providing complete information on expected
monetary value in a path-independent manner. The trials vary only in whether the stock
gained or lost in value; drawn from the probability of price increase for each period of
trading. To ensure independence of trials, and uniform interpretation of provided data by
participants, the following were controlled for:
• Participants were endowed with a stock in each trial to minimize the possible influences of previous stock trends. Hence, learning effects are minimized by creating a
fresh reference value to the subject in each trial.
• To minimize false beliefs attached to a stock, participants were instructed that there
would be no cumulative payoff, and that the payoff in each trial was equally likely to
be drawn as the other, hence providing the incentive to trade in each round equally.
This also controlled for belief updates that might otherwise occur during the course
of the experiment.
• To assure minimum ambiguity, participants were provided the exact probability of
price increase in each trial, and thus varying or hidden expected values were controlled for. This design element hence implicitly restricted participants from erroneously estimating the probability of price increase after experiencing a gain/loss
(both within and across trials).
To ensure that affective cues resulting from the information was restricted to integral
arousal, and not distorted by incidental arousal, noise-cancelling headphones were provided to the participants, to minimize distractions during the experiment.

3.3 Method

3.3.1 Procedure
The experiment was conducted at the Institute of Information Systems and Marketing,
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in accordance with the university’s ethics guidelines.
At the beginning of each session, instructions were read out to all participants, providing
them with general and specific information about the treatments. Participants completed a
questionnaire consisting of 6 questions, in order to ensure understanding of the procedure.
The stock game duration was close to one hour. At the end of the session, participants were
asked to complete additional questionnaires. The experiment was implemented on z-Tree
software (Fischbacher, 2007), while the questionnaires were implemented on Lime-survey
in combination with hand-written text forms. The exact time (in milliseconds) of viewing
information, decision-making, and events in each trial was logged on a per-client basis, in
order to perform event-based analysis on the physiological data. One experimental session
took about 1.5 hours, and in total, 100 subjects participated in 10 sessions (mean age =
22.59, male = 78, female = 22), with ten subjects each. Participants were recruited from a
pool of students using the ORSEE software environment (Greiner, 2004). The experiment
consisted of 10 sessions with ten participants each, and the recruitment system ensured
that no subject attended more than one session. Subjects received a show-up fee of €5,
and earned on an average €26.
During the duration of the experiment, participants’ skin conductivity was recorded
with Ag/AgCl electrodes (silver/silver chloride). These electrodes were attached on the
thenar and hypothenar eminences of the palm of the non-dominant hand by use of standard electrodermal electrode paste. HR was measured using Electrocardiogram (ECG)
electrodes, attached to the chest by means of single use ECG electrodes (Electrodes Ambu
BlueSensor L). Sensor data from both modalities were recorded simultaneously by connecting the first two channels on the Bioplux (2007) system. Each session started with an
initial five minute rest period, necessary for a proper calibration of the physiological signals. 15 subjects had to be excluded from the analysis because no adequate physiological
measures could be assessed, resulting due to measurement sensors with weak or out-ofrange signals with respect to SCR, or insufficient number of cases. All ECG measurements
in this experiment were successful, and artefacts were detected using the standard linear
time-series cleaning algorithm to detect gross artefact or noise, as per the recommendations by Clifford (2007). Hence the dataset consisted of 85 participants with complete
SCR and HR measurements.

61

Chapter 3 Emotion regulation and behavior in trading: to sell or to keep

3.3.2 Measures
Questionnaires were used to assess demographic factors such as age and sex, participants’
experience levels, impressions of the task, and any strategies they employed for the four
treatment levels. This was followed by answering the emotion regulation questionnaire
(ERQ) by Gross and John (2003) to assess the individual ER strategies employed. The
ERQ consisted of ten questions (six for cognitive reappraisal and four for suppression),
containing questions such as "When I want to feel more positive emotion (such as joy or
amusement), I change what I’m thinking about" for measuring reappraisal, vs. "When I
am feeling positive emotions, I am careful not to express them" for measuring suppression. Each question was encoded on a 7-point interval scale. Participants’ ER strategy was
computed by dividing subjects into reappraisers, if the average of their scores for the 6
reappraisal items, was greater than the population mean (of 4.2). Analogously, if the average of the scores for the 4 suppression items was greater than the population mean (of
3.5), they were marked as suppressors. Appendix B contains the complete set of questions
of the ERQ employed in this study.
Finally, the risk aversion questionnaire by Holt and Laury (2002) was also employed
to measure the variations in risk attitudes of participants, by means of 10-item coupled
lottery task. Participants systematically marked their choices on these 10-items. Based on
the crossover point (from 1-10) to the high-risk lottery, the degree of risk aversion can
be inferred (5 being risk neutral, less than 5 being risk-averse, and greater than 5 being
risk-seeking). Based on these, participants’ risk aversion was dummy coded, indicating
whether they were risk averse or not. Appendix B contains the complete risk aversion
questionnaire employed in this study.
In order to observe deviations from EV-maximizing strategies with respect to the treatment variables, dependent variable was computed as follows. Irrespective of the valuation
and whether the price increased or decreased in the first period, the EV-maximizing strategy space in this design was defined as: Sell, for PROB_LOWER, for both VAL_HIGHER and
VAL_LOWER Hold, for PROB_HIGHER, for both VAL_HIGHER and VAL_LOWER Strictly
speaking, this means that subjects should always sell, when a stock PROB_LOWER was
drawn, and should always hold it when a stock PROB_HIGHER was drawn. Each decision was then compared with the EV-maximizing strategy space, to determine if it was an
EV-maximizing decision or not.
For the physiological measures, Figure 3.1 depicts critical events related to this ex-

periment, where the course of decision-making under risk was segmented to identify integral arousal, in tune with previous research (Bechara and Damasio, 2005; Adam and
Kroll, 2012). Event E1 marks the information processing stage, where participants received information about the stake chosen (€2/€10), and the probability of price increase
(0.45/0.55). At Event E2, participants received the first information update about the price
(i.e. gain or loss), after which he/she decides to hold/sell the stock. The actual decision
to hold/sell was made at E3. At E4, the participant received a second price update which
could be processed differently, depending on whether the stock was held or sold.

FIGURE 3.1: Structure of a single round of decision making
With respect to physiology, phasic changes in SCR and HR in response to the events
enlisted above were focused upon. For the analysis, the amplitudes of monophasic SCR
(SCR.amp) were computed as a measure for the intensity of integral arousal, 1-3 seconds
before the event of interest (Boucsein, 1992). Following the recommendations of Fowles et
al. (1981), all SCR.amp values x were than transformed according to log(x +1) in order to
reduce the inherent left skewedness of the SCR.amp. Between-subjects variability of SCR
was reduced by normalizing the subjects’ average response to the average amplitude of the
two events E1 and E2 (before decision) and at E3 (at the point of decision-making). E4
was not taken into account since it takes place post-decision, and hence would fall under
the category of expected emotion, whereas the hypotheses we pursue pertain to the role
of ER strategy on integral arousal. Waning responses in HR were taken as a measure of
parasympathetic activity. Analyzing phasic changes 5 seconds before each event allows an
evaluation of the perceived valence in response to events such as experiencing a gain in the
endowed stock. Analogously, we focused on the ECG within 5 seconds before each event,
and assessed the magnitude of the deceleratory HR response by taking the difference with
the average HR response in the initial cool down period. HR variability features were also
computed in addition.
To summarize: the SCR features, the HR variability features, decrease in phasic HR

63

Chapter 3 Emotion regulation and behavior in trading: to sell or to keep
were considered as proxies for studying the influence of integral arousal. In order to represent the information content of the various features resulting from these three types of
features, a factor analysis method was applied to build a reduced arousal parameter, using
the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm. The orthogonal method of feature
space rotation (Varimax) was adopted to ensure that non-correlated features are rotated
and represented along different dimensions (cf. Schutte et al., 1998; Shivappa et al., 2010,
for a similar approach). The arousal parameter was built by considering features from
both sensors, and from the significant events of interest before the decision. The significant event of interest was fixated upon E2, since this was the only event (among E1, E2,
E3) that yielded a significant difference in heart rate, as revealed by repeated measures
ANOVA for the two treatments PROB and VAL (Section 3.4). Similarly, SCR was calculated for event E2. The final two components depicted in Table3.2 were obtained after
(1) comparing several reductions, (2) removing insignificant and correlated features: for
example HFLF ratio, heart rate variability features calculated using Fast fourier transform,
or the Lomb periodogram methods: for a detailed comparison see (Clifford, 2002), and
(3) performing orthogonal rotation. The best method yielded two principal components
(PC’s) explaining up to 92% of the variance in data, and their factor loadings are depicted
in Table3.2. Two factors are retained, one representing items from SCR (SCR_Fac) and
one representing items from HR (HR_Fac),with one feature overlapping in Component 1.

3.4 Results
Figure 3.2 depicts the distribution of fraction of EV-maximizing decisions over all decisions,
from which it can be observed that participants were distributed predominantly between
0.6 and 1. Of the 100 participants, 57 of them were found be reappraisers while 58 were
classified as suppressors (32 participants applied both these strategies, and 17 of them
used neither of these strategies).

3.4.1 General Observations
Regressions in Tables 3.3 - 3.5 depict behavior regressed on economic indicators, physiological arousal and the ER strategies of a person (dummy variables to indicate whether
he/she was a reappraiser or not, and whether he/she was a suppressor or not). H1.1 H1.4 (a) are based on linear regressions with fixed effects for subject, while H1.1 - H1.4
(b) are based on mixed-effects logistic regressions on the binary dependent variable (if the
decision made was EV-maximizing or not) with the independent variables as fixed effects

and subject random effects. Expectedly, both the treatment variables PROB and VAL significantly explained participants’ EV-maximizing decisions. All regressions further revealed
that the interaction between the PROB_HIGHER and VAL_HIGHER term was a significant
antecedent of participants’ EV-maximizing decisions.

3.4 Results
To account for the emotional arousal during the task, the SCR.amp and decreases in HR
were examined at all events (E1-E3) before the decision, taken treatment-wise. As mentioned earlier, data at E4 was not studied in this context, since it occurred post-decision.
A repeated measures ANOVA revealed that higher valuations resulted in an increase in
SCR.amp (F (1, 88 ) = 28.254, p<0.001) before event E2 when subjects processed information about the first price change. The decision to sell revealed lower amplitudes than
the decision to hold (F (1, 33) = 8.298, p<0.01). However, at event E3, it was more difficult to differentiate if the physiological response is caused by the treatment factors or by
the decision just taken and hence, the responses at/immediately before event E3 would be
a noisy estimator of the EV-maximizing decision. A similar repeated-measures ANOVA for
the average decrease in phasic heart rate 1 second before each event revealed that heart
rate was significantly explained by the valuation (F (1,89) = 28.196, p<.001). At E3, heart
rate was significantly explained by the interaction of VAL_HIGHER and PROB_HIGHER (F
(1, 32) = 5.307, p<0.05), and the decision to sell (F (1, 32) = 4.883, p<0.05). For similar reasons to the ones previously stated, the explanation for the changes in the heart
rate cannot be without noise from the decision at hand, and hence it could not be taken
in as a factor to predict the EV-maximizing decisions. Hence, for the further hypotheses,
the differences in physiology between the treatments only at event E2 were focused upon.
Figure 3.3 depicts the normalized SCR.amp, and Figure 3.4 depicts the decrease in HR, for
the VAL treatment at event E2 averaged across all participants. Taken together, it could be
confirmed that the treatment factor of higher valuations led to an increased SCR at event
E2.

3.4.2 Influence of Emotion Regulation
Regressions for H1.1a and H1.1b in Table3.3 accounted for the effect of reappraisal strategy on experienced arousal level, and the moderating role of reappraisal on the arousal
factors, respectively. Assuming dummy variables for whether a person was dominantly
a reappraiser or not, regressions (1) and (2) in Table3.3 showed that reappraisers experienced lower levels of HR (B=-.082, SE=.027) and lower levels of SCR (B=-.204,
SE=.027). Hence, this confirms H1.1a that reappraisers tend to experience lower levels of
integral arousal, as measured by heart rate and skin conductance. Testing H1.1b, Regression 3 showed that the strategy of reappraisal moderated the heart rate arousal parameter (Arousal_Fac_HR) and led to significantly more EV-maximizing decisions (B=0.220,
SE=.124), thus confirming H1.1b. In other words, applying reappraisal strategies mod-

69

Chapter 3 Emotion regulation and behavior in trading: to sell or to keep

FIGURE 3.3: Normalized Skin Conductance Response for Price Change Event
ifies the extent to which integral arousal impacts EV-maximizing behavior, in this case,
reappraisers exhibit more EV-maximizing behavior, possibly due to the arousal levels associated.
From the regressions (4-6) for H1.2a in Table3.3, the results showed that suppression
did not significantly impact the level of heart rate, while the level of experienced SCR was
significantly higher (B=.135, SE=.027) than for non-suppressors. Further, as shown in
Table3.3, suppression did not significantly moderate the role of arousal on EV-maximizing
behavior, thus invalidating H1.2b.
The above results are well in line with previous findings on the positive influence of
reappraisal strategy in trading contexts (Fenton-O’Creevy et al., 2012). These regressions
(Table3.3 - 3.5) bring to light that it is hence valuable to control for affective responses
and ER to understand EV-maximizing behavior.

3.4 Results

FIGURE 3.4: Differences in heart rate for Price Change Event
We next examine, in the context of whether a gain or loss occurred in the first trading
round, and whether subjects were reappraisers or suppressors or not (H1.3, H1.4), and
how these conditions influenced the level of arousal and the EV-maximizing behavior. As
seen in Regression 3 in Table 3.4, given a gain in the first round, reappraisers experienced a lower level of SCR (B=-.177, SE=.035). Given a loss (Regression 2 & 4) in the
first round, both heart rate measures (B=-.150, SE=.038) and SCR (B=-.230, SE=.042)
were significantly lower for reappraisers. The above results confirm H1.3a that reappraisers experience lower levels of arousal, given a loss. For gains, however, whereas theory
predicts that reappraisers have an increased level of arousal, the data showed otherwise.
These results point in the direction that, irrespective of the gains and losses experienced,
reappraisers tend to have a lower level of arousal. Secondly, turning to H1.3b, regression 6 in Table3.4 shows that given a loss in the first round, reappraisal interacts with HR

71

Chapter 3 Emotion regulation and behavior in trading: to sell or to keep
arousal leading to more EV-maximizing behavior (B=0.401, p=0.034), hence confirming
the first part of H1.3. Similar significant moderating effects on arousal were not observed
for reappraisers, given a gain in the first round (Regression 5). Finally, Regressions 9 and
10 in Table3.5 reveals that suppressors experienced a higher level of SCR, for both gains
and losses. This result, although indicative of a difference in arousal level for suppressors,
and hence confirming H1.4a, is in the opposite direction as predicted by theory. No such
differences in heart rate were observed for suppressors, after experiencing a gain or a loss.
Moreover, the moderating effect of suppression strategies on arousal was not significant in
the context of gain or loss (Regressions 11 and 12), thus providing no support for H1.4b.
In order to validate the above hypotheses further, risk attitudes were controlled for by
using the risk-aversion questionnaire (Holt and Laury, 2002). However, risk aversion did
not significantly moderate the impact of the two arousal parameters, or the ER strategies,
and hence did not increase the explanatory power. Finally, controlling for gender, no
significant direct or moderating role on arousal or on EV-maximizing decisions either was
found, showing robustness against controlling for possible gender effects.

3.4.3 Attraction to Chance
When gambles that involve possible gains are presented one at a time most people display a
level of appeal towards the gambles. The phenomenon of gaining satisfaction directly from
the riskiness of the situation has been termed as the attraction to chance, and of suffering
dissatisfaction directly from the riskiness of the situation, repulsion from chance (Albers
et al., 2000). Adam and Kroll (2012) established through experiments with physiological
measurements that attraction to chance can be explained by differences in emotions that
subjects experience based on the choices made by people for different types of lotteries.
In situations of low stakes and low probability to win, we observe the behavioral bias
wherein: participants are exposed to "attraction to chance," for which we also report physiological indication in the following. Table3.6 summarizes the number of hold decisions
taken by participants, treatment-wise. It is worth noting that there was a significant difference in the scores for number of held decisions in the VAL_LOWER (M=6.282, SD =
4.520) and VAL_HIGHER (M=3.729, SD = 3.279) when considering the treatment of
PROB_LOWER (t (69) = 3.969, p<.001). These decisions are quite out of the ordinary,
especially in the presence of complete information on the probability of winning. In fact, it
illustrates the phenomenon of attraction to chance, which could be seen/interpreted as the

emotional gratification derived from making a risky choice. Specifically, subjects choose
to hold a stock in the case of low probability of price increase and a low stakes stock, even
when the outcome is not as would be expected under EUT. We next test additionally, if
there is physiological indication for attraction to chance observed before the "hold" decision in PROB_LOWER, VAL_LOWER treatment. A paired sample t-test revealed that at E1
participants differed significantly in SCR.amp (t(69)=2.344, p=.020) between their hold
and sell decisions (Table3.7). However, during E2, the SCR.amp is not significantly different between hold and sell decisions for the PROB, or the VAL treatment. This observation
points in the direction that while the anticipatory emotion before a hold and sell decision
is not significantly different when viewed treatment-wise, attraction to chance manifests
itself more clearly at event E1, when subjects receive the information about the stock, and
decide to hold or sell the stock. At event E2, subjects seem to experience a sense of reality
due to the first price update, leaving them possibly "less attracted to chance," which explains why this event did not provide a potential explanation for the difference between
hold and sell decisions.

Chapter 3 Emotion regulation and behavior in trading: to sell or to keep

3.5 Discussion
In this chapter, we aim to further our understanding on deviations from EV maximization in a trading context, by studying the direct and the moderating role of ER strategies
on emotional arousal and on EV-maximizing behavior, respectively. We hypothesize that
adopting different ER strategies are accompanied by different levels of integral arousal,
and has a significant moderating role on integral arousal, in explaining deviations from
behavior as defined by expected-value maximization. To this end, a single-decision trading
experiment is implemented, along with questionnaires and physiological measures.
The results reveal significantly lower levels of integral arousal (HR and SCR) for reappraisers (H1.1a), and higher levels of integral arousal (SCR) for suppressors (H1.2a). Also,
the moderating effect of reappraisal strategy on arousal significantly increased the EVmaximizing behavior (H1.1b). A similar moderating effect of suppression was however,
not significant (H1.2b). Also, only heart rate was moderated by the ER strategy leading
to EV-maximizing behavior, whereas the SCR factor was not visibly influenced. This is an
indicator that ER acts as a coping strategy in down-regulating valence particularly, and
less efficient in down-regulating arousal.
Another interesting observation is that reappraisal has a significant moderating impact
on arousal to explain EV-maximizing behavior, whereas suppression has no impact. These
imply that reappraisal (i.e., cognitively altering the experience of emotions) is likely to be
indicative of an increased affective awareness or an increased affective control, and hence
plays a significant role on the relationship between emotional arousal and EV-maximizing
behavior. In other words, while arousal leads to less EV-maximizing behavior for nonreappraisers, arousal actually turns out to be beneficial for reappraisers: the more aroused
a reappraiser, the higher his/her likelihood of EV-maximizing decisions. These results
are in tune with Heilman et al. (2010), wherein reappraisers reported reduced negative
affect, further confirmed by Yang et al. (2014), who report that implicit emotion regulation
effectively modulated the subjective affective experience.
Clearly, the strategy of suppression is not advantageous, and in fact has even shown
to have detrimental effects on task performance in the above studies. Our results offer
evidence that suppressors experienced an increased level of SCR, in both the context of
gains and losses (H1.4a). Suppression did not play any role in altering the impact of
emotions on EV-maximizing behavior, given a loss or a gain (H1.4b). This may be the
case as suppression does not pertain to altering, but rather to inhibiting the experience of

76

3.5 Discussion
emotions and that the present study deals with consequentialist emotions prior to decisions
(integral arousal). Another opportunity could be that suppression-as it occurs after an
emotional response is generated-affects only counterfactual emotions, i.e., regretting a
decision, or thinking about "what-could-have-been" after the consequences of the taken
decision are experienced.
Previous studies have indicated that suppression of a thought results in an immediate
increase of the frequency of this thought and/or in a rebound effect, i.e. in a heightened
frequency of this thought later on (Muris et al., 1992). Hence, suppression is not necessarily an advisable strategy in this context, since it is likely to resurface at an inappropriate
point in time with high intensity, potentially resulting in detrimental effects on behavior.
When it comes to the long-term effects of ER (i.e., the changes in employing specific strategies accompanied with aging), self-report evidence shows an age-related shift
away from the response-focused strategy of emotional suppression toward the antecedentfocused strategy of reappraisal, which appears to be more efficient and less cognitively
demanding (John and Gross, 2004). This is especially so, since suppression requires more
cognitive effort, and with aging, people develop the skills to allocate their cognitive resources more efficiently, i.e., avoiding negative stimuli or avoiding excessive use of cognitive resources by suppression. While these long-term changes in emotion regulation with
aging are not visible in our sample group, consisting only of university students, replicating
our study with senior participants would throw further light on (i) the tendency to apply
suppression in a decision-making context as a strategy in advanced age and (ii) whether
there is a significant impact of suppression on outcomes. The cognitive effort involved,
combined with the above-mentioned rebound effect, should make suppression a disadvantageous strategy for EV-maximizing behavior. However, further research is necessary,
to investigate whether suppression in itself manifests as an intense physiological reaction
consistently affecting behavior.
The impact of reappraisal is significant for situations of loss, which is not observed as
strongly for situations of gain (H1.3a). This result suggests that cognitive reappraisal of
negative emotion is not only feasible, but could also be beneficial, suggestive of a coping
mechanism that traders/private investors should be trained to practice. The most relevant
example to this end is the disposition effect, coined by Odean (1998), which highlights
the tendency of traders to hold their losses too long, and to sell their gains too soon. This
effect stems from the inability of traders to deal with losses, which according to the results
of this study, can be trained by use of reappraisal strategies. As illustrated by Astor et al.

77

Chapter 3 Emotion regulation and behavior in trading: to sell or to keep
(2013a), psychophysiological measures could additionally validate if the training is indeed
effective, and if participants are able to achieve better decision-making performance (in
this case auctions), by using suitable reappraisal-inducing techniques.
Research on the coherence of emotion regulation and the "dual system" models (System
I: consisting of the automatic, affective system and System II: consisting of the deliberative,
cognitive system) in the context of decision-making is scarce (Lieberman, 2007). It appears
possible that deliberative strategies that are required by the ER strategy of suppression
(analogous to System II processes), are not necessarily associated with better outcomes in
terms of EV maximization. Reappraisal on the other hand, makes more cognitive resources
available, and providing the potential to lead to more EV-maximizing decisions. This is
especially true of emotionally demanding situations, where System II resources need to be
used in order to perform the task, and when these resources are not available due to the ER
strategy employed, it leads to less EV-maximizing behavior. This is a possible explanation
for the underlying relationship between ER and the dual processing theory, but remains
an intriguing topic, that will have to be examined in future research.
In the presence of a loss, the modality of HR has been moderated by reappraisal leading
to more EV-maximizing decisions (H1.3b). If HR were assumed as a proxy for valence, this
indicates that reappraisal moderates negative emotions leading to more EV-maximizing
decisions. Hence in debiasing, the quality of emotion (not only the arousal, but also the
valence of emotion) that is debiased needs to be considered.

3.6 Limitations and Future Work
This chapter provides a research model that tests whether ER strategies moderate the role
of emotions in EV-maximizing behavior. Nevertheless, there are limitations that need to
be addressed in further work. In this experiment, based on previous work (Weber and
Welfens, 2008), we specified two levels of probabilities and valuations. Whereas this design was successful in eliciting responses for higher and lower levels of treatment variables, it would be interesting to investigate this study with more probabilities, to determine
whether the choice of probability might have an impact on how participants emote, regulate their emotions, and behave. Moreover, this study focusses on the decision problem
in a granular level to understand deviations from EV maximization. These observations
will have to be extrapolated on continuous trading data, in order to further verify and

78

3.7 Conclusion
validate them. Also, it has been shown in continuous trading that, participants’ reference
levels shift across a given span of time, depending on their most recent profits and gains
(Barber and Odean, 2001). In order to have a consistent reference point to compare the
treatments of VAL and PROB; this aspect has been controlled for in this study by design.
By means of field experiments, this aspect of continuous re-referencing and the impact of
ER strategies on EV-maximizing behavior would have to be studied further. Moreover, ER
strategies were not exogenously assigned in this context, and hence, in order to verify for
potentially correlated individual characteristics that moderate the role of integral arousal
on EV-maximizing behavior, the study will have to be replicated with exogenously assigned
strategies. Finally, the finding that reappraisers (suppressors) experience lower (higher)
levels of integral arousal should be examined more closely and verified in different contexts.

3.7 Conclusion
Turning to the research question RQ1 posed in the beginning of this chapter, it can be seen
that, in an individual decision context, emotion-regulation strategies indeed moderate the
role of integral arousal on EV-maximizing behavior. This is illustrative, that emotion impacts behavior, depending on whether a person reappraises his emotions or suppresses
them. This brings to light, that the role of emotions on behavior, is dependent on individual differences in emotion regulation, and this needs to be carefully dealt with, while
understanding decision processes involving information, and external events, in this case,
of gains and losses. Specifically, the significant role of reappraisal, particularly in dealing
with the external influences of gains and losses, has been observed in this study, illustrating that external influences manifest as internal influences on behavior. Hence, we argue
that incorporating affective processes, along with individual differences in processing affect (i.e., the emotion regulation strategy), is a critical link for understanding the impact
of events that occur during the course of a decision-making process.
In understanding the emotional underpinings of decision processes, we focused on the
case of traders, where the cost of making decisions is high, justifying why their decision
processes need to be well understood. However, what we learned from this study, is that
the impact of the internal process of affect on behavior, is heavily dependent on a measurable attribute of a person, namely the emotion regulation strategy, and additionally so,
when an external event such as a gain or a loss is experienced. This suggests that, the

79

Chapter 3 Emotion regulation and behavior in trading: to sell or to keep
seemingly rational factors (in this case, the expected value of a decision) are dependent
on the arousal experienced by the decision-maker. This particular result hence opens the
possibility to a broader set of questions, moving from the case of the trader as a decisionmaker, to that of a consumer, to further our understanding of decision processes. The first
question amongst them is, are these results applicable in a decision context, wherein individuals are not only deciding on the basis of information presented to them, but in the
presence of other decision-makers (i.e., a group setting)? We hence undertake the case
of auctions, where consumers are the decision-makers, and which involves elements of
competition. The decision process in this case, is one of bidding optimally, minimizing the
cost paid, but being able to win the auction at the same time.
The second question that opens up, as a result of this chapter, could be stated as follows.
Given that reappraisal is by definition a cognitive strategy, involving deliberatively altering
the way one thinks about a situation - is there more at play, as to when and why arousal
impacts behavior? In other words, is it possible, that, in order to understand affect, one has
to consider whether and how cognition impacts decision-making, along with the influence
of affective processes? If this were the case, how are the two processes (of cognition
and affect) acting, based on external influences? In the following chapter, we explore in
greater detail the following: whether the influence of internal processes (of cognition and
affect) on behavior is dependent on specific economic external factors (such as the auction
dynamics, and the information uncertainty associated with the value of a product), and if
so, to what extent. We hence study the case of auctions, and how the processes of emotions
and cognitive demand, impact optimal bidding.

Cognitive and affective processes in
auction bidding

“

There can be no knowledge about emotion. We may

be aware of a truth, yet until we have felt its force, it is
not ours. To the cognition of the brain must be added
the experience of the soul.”
ARNOLD BENNETT (1867-1931)

4.1 Introduction
Everything starts in the mind. The most profound of philosophical thoughts to the most
mundane of activities stem from the human brain, making humans highly mental creatures. Due to a heavy dependence on the decisions we make, we are well advised to constantly watch and control our mind in order to handle positive and negative events alike.
While this undoubtedly holds for private life, it has shown to extend to markets in general
(Lerner et al., 2004) and electronic markets in particular (Adam et al., 2011). Auctions are
frequently used market mechanisms for determining resource allocation and prices in markets around the world. Prominent examples include spectrum license auctions (Kroemer
et al., 2016) , the Dutch flower market, and Internet consumer auctions such as eBay and
DealDash (Ariely and Simonson, 2003; Adam et al., 2012a). To inform the design of such

81

Chapter 4 Cognitive and affective processes in auction bidding
markets, economic theory provides a rich set of models for understanding the behavior of
auction participants and how they reflect different parameters of the auction environment
in their bids (Kagel and Levin, 1986, 2002). However, auction theorists have raised important questions regarding the nature of the decision processes underlying human bidding
behavior, as empirical studies repeatedly provide evidence that human bidders deviate
from the theoretically derived optimal bid functions (Rothkopf and Harstad, 1994; Kambil and van Heck, 2004). In this chapter, we particularly focus on two parameters of the
auction environment, namely auction dynamics and value uncertainty, which have been
found to be key determinants of bid deviations.
First, auctions may differ in the extent of auction dynamics, e.g., caused by different
time constraints for placing a bid. For instance, Dutch auctions start with a high price,
which is dynamically decreased until one of the bidders places a bid, thus accepting to buy
the good at that price and ending the auction. In contrast, in first-price sealed-bid auctions
(FPSB), all bidders submit their bids simultaneously by a concealed method, usually without explicit time pressure. The bidder with the highest bid wins the item and pays their bid.
While the two auction formats are strategically equivalent from a theoretical perspective
(McAfee and McMillan, 1987), applying different formats in practice has shown to yield
differences in behavior (Katok and Kwasnica, 2008; Adam et al., 2012a). Second, within
an auction for a specific good, there may exist different levels of value uncertainty about
the true value of the good (such as for spectrum licenses), which has direct ramifications
for determining the optimal bid. Factors like strategic considerations, risk preferences,
and the inherent selection mechanism of auctions (i.e., the risk of biased information, also
known as the "winner’s curse") are often at work simultaneously in influencing whether
and how bidders might deviate from optimal bids.
It is widely accepted that decisions depend on cognitive as well as affective demands
(Agarwal and Malhotra, 2005; Turel et al., 2011). In a simplified conceptualization, the
mind can be broken down into the above two components, brought together within dual
processing theory (Lieberman, 2007). In the context of auction bidding, both systems
may be involved, i.e., cognitive workload (van den Bos et al., 2008) as well as emotional
arousal (Adam et al., 2012a) in influencing bidding behavior. The impact of the internal
processes on bidding behavior, however, is affected by the external auction environment
in which the decision-maker is placed in. On the one hand, bidders might experience
emotional arousal in anticipation of submitting a bid or while winning/losing an auction
(Teubner et al., 2015; Adam et al., 2015). On the other hand, auctions also confront
bidders with a puzzle-like task, in which considering aspects such as the auction format,

82

4.2 Theoretical Background
other bidders’ bids, and value uncertainty is essential for placing optimal bids. Hence,
auctions necessitate significant cognitive effort before making a decision. From a market
design perspective, and also from the perspective of market participants, it is valuable
to understand whether and how the auction environment determines the impact of the
internal processes (of cognitive workload and emotional arousal) on bidding behavior, in
terms of deviations from the optimal bid. The research question addressed in this chapter
is:
RQ2:In a group context, to what extent is the relationship between cognitive and
affective processes and bid deviations determined by auction dynamics and value
uncertainty?
To address this question, an auction experiment was designed and conducted with 39
participants. By varying two aspects of the auction environment, namely auction dynamics and value uncertainty, we measure the cognitive workload and emotional arousal, and
how these processes are correlated with bidding behavior, assessed in comparison to the
optimal bid Kagel.1986,vandenBos.2013. In order to measure cognitive workload during
the task, a self-reported scale (NASA-TLX, Hart (1988)) and a physiological scale (Electroencephalography, EEG) were used. Emotional arousal was measured using phasic heart
rate changes throughout the experiment, in accordance with the recommendations of NeuroIS methodologies, as proposed by Riedl et al. (2014).
Our results show that higher auction dynamics increase the role of emotional arousal
to lead to larger deviations from the optimal bid, but not that of cognitive workload. High
value uncertainty, in contrast, significantly increases the role of cognitive workload, leading to larger deviations from the optimal bid, but not that of emotional arousal. The
remainder of the chapter is structured as follows: Section 4.2 outlines theoretical background and related literature, developing the hypotheses. Section 4.3 depicts the experimental design, methodology, and measures employed, followed by the results and analyses
in Section 4.4. Section 4.5 discusses implications, limitations, and directions for future research.

4.2 Theoretical Background
To understand and to predict the behavior of auction participants, economists have proposed optimal bid functions based on specific assumptions about the bidders (e.g., risk-

83

Chapter 4 Cognitive and affective processes in auction bidding
neutrality, Kagel Levin, 1986). However, there is evidence that bidders systematically
deviate from such optimal bid functions, e.g., due to competitive arousal (Ku et al., 2005),
expected regret (Astor et al., 2011), agency (Teubner et al., 2015), or pseudo-endowment
(Ariely and Simonson, 2003). In this regard, deviations from the optimal bid represent a
measure as to how bidders are affected by the specific conditions of an auction environment. To assess participants’ bidding behavior, in this study we thus examine bid deviations
(∆B) from the optimal bid. Based on theoretical and empirical literature, we first outline
how emotional arousal (EA) and cognitive workload (CW) might be associated with bid
deviations. We then develop hypotheses as to why and how these associations may be
moderated by the treatment variables auction dynamics (AD) and value uncertainty (VU).
Figure 4.1 connects all factors and hypotheses in a concise research model.

FIGURE 4.1: Research Model

4.2.1 The Influence of Emotional Arousal and Cognitive Workload on
bid deviations
The dual process model of decision-making, with the distinction of decision-making into
affective and cognitive processes, is a useful simplified scheme to analyze arousal and
cognitive workload related aspects as determinants of choices (Lieberman, 2007). In the

84

4.2 Theoretical Background
context of economic decision-making and auction bidding in particular, emotions have
been distinguished as anticipated and integral emotions (Loewenstein, 2000; Adam et al.,
2011). It has been shown that anticipated emotions impact decisions to a large extent,
since they could decide if the intention to bid actually translates into action. EngelbrechtWiggans and Katok (2008) further illustrated the above point and distinguished winner
and loser regret. Anticipated emotions of regret were shown to lead to lower bids, reducing
over-bidding, and hence yield smaller bid deviations. In addition to anticipated emotions,
emotions may be integral, which arise due to the auction environment, accompanied by
physiological changes prior to the auction (Teubner et al., 2015). Here, integral emotions
have shown to be associated with lower bids when competing with human bidders. In
the context of online shopping, emotions have shown to impact purchasing intentions and
decisions, depending on whether positive or negative emotions were experienced (Pappas
et al., 2014). Under the premises, we also expect to observe that context-specific emotional
arousal, as measured by physiological changes, primarily drive the bidder’s actions (i.e.,
the bids), in accordance with the framework for emotional bidding as shown in Adam et al.
(2011).
While actions could be the culmination of a myriad of emotional processes, bids also
could be the outcome of detailed strategic thinking and deliberative thought processes,
involving cognitive effort and workload. In a survey-based Internet study on eBay participants, Möllenberg (2004) categorized bidders into two classes: "auctainers" and "smart
bidders." Auctainers are experience-oriented, attracted by emotional stimuli, and tend to
bid aggressively. In contrast, smart bidders are result-oriented, attracted primarily by cognitive stimuli and strictly adhere to preselected bidding limits. Such cognitive reasoning
could be applied by the bidder due to several reasons and correspondingly bear different
implications for bids. One of the primary tasks of the bidders in common value auctions,
for instance, is to estimate the actual value of the item at stake. Assuming risk-neutral
bidders, Kagel and Levin (1986) showed that in common value auctions the optimal bid is
theoretically given by the difference between a bidder’s own private signal and the commonly known error term with which private signals are drawn. Hence, determining the
optimal bid typically involves the (1) interpretation of the private signal, (2) knowledge
of the error term in drawing the private signal, (3) taking the difference between the two
values, and (4) bidding at the right time (in the case of dynamic auctions). In addition
to the above, Camerer et al. (2004) posited the cognitive hierarchy model, in which each
player believes that he or she understands the game better than the other players. Such
strategic thinking could involve computation of one’s own strategy, as well as taking into

85

Chapter 4 Cognitive and affective processes in auction bidding
account others’ strategies, and iteratively, taking into account whether others account for
others’ strategy or not, and so on. The cognitive hierarchical model highlights the extent
to which the information setting could determine the level of cognitive workload experienced in an auction. Given the informational setting of an auction,van den Bos et al.
(2008) suggested that humans have limited cognitive abilities that make accounting for
the winner’s curse (Kagel and Levin, 1986) difficult, if not impossible. Hence, the process
of estimating the value of an item itself, as well as finding the optimal bid to place, represent cognitively demanding tasks. So far, the direct underlying impact of the internal
processes (emotional arousal, cognitive workload) on bid deviations has been established
from previous work. We next outline how the relationships may be determined by aspects
of the (external) auction environment, i.e., auction dynamics and value uncertainty.

4.2.2 The Role of Auction Dynamics
In the following, we outline how auction dynamics may impact the relation between emotional arousal, cognitive workload, and bid deviations. Considering static auctions, a single
bid is submitted without knowledge of other bidders’ actions or any degree of interaction,
whereas dynamic auctions entail both elements. In English auctions, for instance, a bidder
repeatedly experiences other bidders’ actions and faces the decision whether to respond
or not, enabling a potentially endless process and the possibility of "bidding wars" (Ariely
et al., 2005) among subgroups of participants. Dutch auctions, as another example, involve
an element of timing and a constant trade-off between delay, profit, and ri surrounding
the item being contested for. While bidding is a complex task that can involve considerable amounts of computation, it was found to highly depend on the auction’s dynamics.
For instance, Katok and Kwasnica (2008) showed that at fast clock speeds, revenue in the
Dutch auction was significantly lower than it was in the FPSB auction. Thus, even though
the two auction formats (Dutch and FPSB auctions) are outcome-equivalent from a theoretical perspective, several differences exist in the overall outcome, indicating that besides
economic considerations, other factors must be at play.
Ku et al. (2005) examined the influence of competitive arousal on bids for the case of
live and Internet auctions, showing that the emotional aspect of "desire to win" is increased
when rivalry and time pressure coincide, to mediate the effect of time pressure on bid deviations, resulting in over-bidding. Using a series of Dutch auctions with different clock
speeds, Adam et al. (2012a) showed that in fast Dutch auctions bidders are more excited
and stay longer in the bidding process as compared to slow Dutch auctions, thus resulting

86

4.2 Theoretical Background
in lower prices in the former. Katok and Kwasnica (2008) suggested that auction dynamics
determines whether and how emotional arousal impacts bids and hence outcomes. Using
an experiment on risky decisions under time pressure, Slovic et al. (2007) demonstrated
that the reliance on an affect heuristic seems to be exposed more clearly when the subjects’ opportunity for analytic deliberation is reduced (e.g., due to time pressure), hence
requiring an affective mode of judgement. The above studies indicate that high auction
dynamics affect the extent to which emotional arousal impacts bid deviations, and hence
the overall auction results. Considering situations of high dynamics, it is likely that the focus might be on "feeling" rather than "thinking" such that bids are rather guided by arousal
than by cognition. In other words, it is likely that auction dynamics increase the impact of
emotional arousal on bid deviations. Hypothesis H2.1 states:
Hypothesis 2.1: Auction dynamics (AD) moderate the relationship between arousal
(AR) and bid deviations (∆B).
As just described, we expect the focus to shift towards emotional processes in highdynamics situations and hence a less pronounced role of cognitive workload on bid deviations. A crucial determinant of the extent to which cognitive workload is likely to be
applied in an auction environment is the amount of time available to deliberate. For illustration, consider a fight or flight scenario, e.g., when facing a dangerous situation. The
dynamics here can be regarded as very high, i.e., considerations and actions need to take
place in split seconds. In contexts of high time pressure, it has been shown, that consumers
have a higher cognitive cost when there is less time available, due to increased information search and processing rates (Punj and Moore, 2009). Mann and Tan (1993) showed
that time-pressured students generated fewer alternatives and considered fewer consequences in their decision-making process. It is hence possible that in situations of high
time pressure, the cognitive process and consequently the cognitive workload, is higher.
The situation of increased cognitive demand opens two possibilities: (1) that decisions
are made using an affect-based heuristic, thus relying on automatic processes, rather than
deliberative processes (Slovic et al., 2007), or (2) in the case that deliberative processes
are applied, participants deviate more from optimal bid, since weighing all alternatives
in the given decision context is a cognitively demanding task. Based on the research outline above, it seems plausible that the external factor of auction dynamics is a potential
moderating factor on how cognitive workload impacts bid deviations. Hypothesis H2.2
states:
Hypothesis 2.2: Auction dynamics (AD) moderate the relationship between cog-

87

Chapter 4 Cognitive and affective processes in auction bidding
nitive workload (CW) and bid deviations (∆B).

4.2.3 The Role of Value Uncertainty
Another aspect specific to auctions is the level of uncertainty associated with the value of
the underlying good. In common value auctions, for instance, the probability distribution
of the item’s value is the same for all bidders but its true value is unknown to the bidders
at the time of the auction. Each bidder typically possesses information on the distribution
from which the true value is drawn, by means of a more specific private signal (McAfee and
McMillan, 1987). The private signal, however, entails some degree of uncertainty about
the value of the good. As suggested by Yin (2006), value uncertainty may arise due to
dispersed information across auction participants or the uncertainty about the trustworthiness of the seller. Both aspects were found to be significant drivers for bids and final
prices. Some goods like oil drilling rights, for instance, are uncertain in nature, as prior
exploration cannot fully and exactly ascertain what quantity of oil is likely to be extracted.
Specifically, in common value auctions, assuming that each bidder receives a private signal
about the common value, the value uncertainty for each bidder primarily stems from the
variance with which the private signal is drawn. It is hence likely that people may bid
past their initial limits since they use personal and social information to evaluate an item’s
value due to the uncertainty of information.
We first turn to the potential emotional ramifications of uncertainty for bid deviations.
Eriksson and Sharma (2003) showed that different emotions (such as sadness and anxiety), have a different impact on the way uncertainty is perceived, subsequently impacting
buyer-seller cooperation. Specifically, anxious individuals were found to be more likely to
make decisions that reduced uncertainty and avoided risk. Loewenstein (2000) stated that
fear tends to increase over time as a particular risk becomes temporally imminent, which
produces the phenomenon of "chickening out," as the "moment of truth" draws near, and
alters behavior. In the context of gambling, Cowley (2013) showed (1) that subjects underestimated the role of anxiety and overestimated the role of excitement when dealing
with value uncertainty, and (2) that the inaccuracies in forecasting values occurred because the immediate emotional reactions to uncertainty are difficult to factor in. Thus,
previous literature indicates that value uncertainty triggers internal emotional processes,
and subsequently influences the course of decision. We hence postulate that facing higher
degrees of value uncertainty might alter the influence of emotional arousal on bid deviations. Hypothesis H2.3 states:

88

4.3 Materials and Methods
Hypothesis 2.3: Value uncertainty (VU) moderates the relationship between arousal
(AR) and bid deviations (∆B).
Next, we discuss the potential cognitive impact of uncertainty on bid deviations. Mousavi
and Gigerenzer (2014) theorized that uncertainty is a context that requires knowledge, and
cognitive deliberation, such that expert decisions under uncertainty are often compelled
to rely on heuristic principles. In order to reduce uncertainty, people have been shown to
resort to searching through memory for relevant knowledge or using cues from the task,
hence signaling potentially a higher level of cognitive effort under uncertainty (Gilboa and
Schmeidler, 2000). In auction-bidding processes, Muthitachareon et al. (2014) showed
that consumers’ goal of minimizing cognitive effort can explain the correlation between
price premium and transaction uncertainty, thus highlighting that cognitive cost is a critical factor that drives decision-making processes. Under uncertainty, a trade-off has to
be made between the costs of action (e.g., information search) and the risks in taking no
action. For the case of FPSB common-value auctions,Kagel and Levin (1986) showed in
experimental conditions, that higher value uncertainty led bidders to deviate more from
optimal bid. Participants also had greater difficulties in estimating true values when uncertainty was high. Conjoining the empirical evidence from the literature, we suggest that
value uncertainty in the auction environment determines how cognitive workload impacts
bid deviations:
Hypothesis 2.4: Value uncertainty (VU) moderates the relationship between cognitive workload (CW) and bid deviations (∆B).
In the following, we outline the experimental auction setting to test the above hypotheses.

4.3 Materials and Methods
This section describes the experimental design of our study, including treatment and auction structure, and overall procedure. To test the hypotheses, we utilize a full-factorial
within-subject experimental design with repeated trials. In our experiment, each participant takes part in a series of 40 auctions, where the treatment variables auction dynamics (AD: low or high) and value uncertainty (VU: low or high) are varied systematically.
Hence, each of the four possible combinations occurs exactly ten times.

89

Chapter 4 Cognitive and affective processes in auction bidding

4.3.1 Auction and treatment structure
In order to test the above hypotheses, we utilize a full-factorial within-subject experimental design with repeated trials. The auction is designed based on Kagel’s (1989) as well
as Kagel and Levin’s (2002) common value model. In each auction, the true value (Vo)
is drawn randomly from the uniform distribution [15, 100], measured in monetary units
(MU). Private information signals (x) are drawn randomly from the uniform distribution
[Vo − ε, Vo + ε], where ε represents the error term, or the value uncertainty in the private
signal, i.e., how far away the private signal can be from the true value. In order to operationalize auction dynamics, participants played two auction formats (Dutch auctions,
being a dynamic auction with limited time to submit bids, and FPSB auctions, being a static
auction with no time pressure to submit bids). By varying the ε (and hence the interval)
in which private signals are drawn, two levels of value uncertainty (3 MU and 12 MU) in
information are presented. Bidders (computer and human) are provided their individually
drawn private signal, while the error term and the distribution of the true value [15, 100]
MU is common knowledge. Given x, ε, and the endpoint values, each bidder can hence
compute an upper and lower bound on the value of Vo by considering min (Vo + ε, 100)
and max (Vo − ε, 15). The expected bidding strategy is based on the RNNE strategy (x −ε)
defined later in this work. Computer opponents are programmed to place the RNNE bid
based on their respective randomly drawn private signals.
Each subject played against two computer opponents. Since humans have shown to
behave differently in the presence of human vs. computer agents (Teubner et al., 2015),
careful considerations were made with respect to the information levels that participants
had. For instance, Grossklags and Schmidt (2006) show under a laboratory condition that
common knowledge about the presence of software agents triggers more efficient market
prices when the programmed strategy was employed. Furthermore, the authors interpret
that the existence of a computer agent with an unknown strategy might boost curiosity
and the willingness to participate in a potentially less favorable environment, due to the
unspoken capabilities of a computer agent. Taking these results into account, in the current
experimental design, we provided information to participants that they were bidding with
two computer agents in each auction; however the exact bidding strategy of the agents
was not revealed. In case of a tie, participants were informed that the winner was picked
at random. The number of bidders is important information, since it leads participants to
adjust their strategy based on the level of competition, and their wins and losses in the
auctions. Since the primary focus in this study is on RNNE predictions, in order to control

90

4.3 Materials and Methods
for a potential winner’s curse we restrict this study to 3 bidders in each auction, analogous
to Katok and Kwasnica (2008); Engelbrecht-Wiggans and Katok (2008); Astor et al. (2013)
with 2 computer opponents for each human bidder.
In all auctions, participants could enter their bids in units of 0.5 MU, and could bid
positive values only. As is characteristic of a FPSB auction, there was no limit on the
time for participants to enter their bids. Whereas in the Dutch auction, a clock ticked
downwards in units of 0.5 MU, at a speed of 0.5 seconds, modeling a dynamic auction
and inducing time pressure (the speed of 0.5 seconds has been derived from previous
experiments where participants could stop the clock at several speeds: (Adam et al., 2012b,
2015). Since the participants bid based on their private signal and error term information,
indicating that the true value of the good is different in each round, they are subtly enforced
to bid afresh in each round, avoiding the notion of ownership or a possible endowment
effect.

4.3.2 Risk-neutral Nash Equilibrium in Common Value auctions
In this chapter, in order to assess the decision quality of bidders, the Risk-Neutral Nash
Equilibrium (RNNE) as defined by Kagel (1989) has been adopted as the primary measure. In this section, we examine the derivation of this measure. The RNNE bid was
defined based on the central assumption, that bidders are risk-neutral. In common value
auctions, bidders are most likely to win if they have the highest estimation of the item’s
value (assuming that bids are an increasing function of these estimates). In other words,
the winning bidder has the most optimistic, and hence highest estimate of the item’s true
value. If this problem of adverse selection is not accounted for in the process of defining
a bidding strategy, winning bids are likely to result in negative profits Kagel and Levin
(1986). This adverse selection problem in CV auctions is often referred to as the "winner’s
curse."
Most RNNE bid functions do account for the winner’s curse in some way. Under the
following assumptions:
1. the common value (x 0 ) of the auctioned item is randomly drawn from a known
uniform distribution with upper and lower bounds [x, x)]
2. each bidder is provided with a private information signal (x)

91

Chapter 4 Cognitive and affective processes in auction bidding
3. x is randomly drawn from a known uniform distribution with upper and lower
bounds [x 0 − ε, x 0 + ε]
4. ε is common knowledge
then, the symmetric RNNE bid function γ(x) for risk-neutral bidders is given by
γ(x) = x − ε + h(x)
with

h(x) =

n
2ε
ex p[− (x − (x + ε))]
n+1
2ε

n stands for the number of bidders. Kagel and Levin (1986) provide detailed reasoning
to incorporate the interplay of different strategic considerations into the "bid factor" h(x),
but as h(x) approaches zero rather quickly as x moves beyond (x + epsilon), the RNNE
bid function can be approximated by

γ(x) = x − ε
In this chapter, subjects’ behavior is assessed using this benchmark RNNE function. In
addition, the two computer bidders are programmed with this bidding function, based on
the private signal randomly drawn out to the computer bidders in each round. The above
RNNE function fully accounts for the adverse selection problem mentioned earlier, but it
does not account for risk aversion. Still, using the RNNE bid as a benchmark provides a
convenient way to analyze the subjects’ bidding behavior from a game-theoretic point of
view.

4.3.3 Procedure
A total of 39 participants (28 male and 11 female bidders) were recruited for sessions
of 90 minutes. We had to remove 2 participants from the dataset due to incomplete/
corrupted physiological measurements. Thus, we analyze a data sample of 39 - 2 = 37
participants (26 male and 11 female bidders). Participants were students, pursuing their

92

4.3 Materials and Methods
Bachelor or Master studies, from the domains of engineering, economic sciences, and information systems. To establish incentives and to create a link between bidding behavior
and payoffs (Induced Value Theory, Smith (1976)), participants received a variable payoff
based on all earnings or losses in the experiment, where 1 MU was converted to 0.05 EUR.
Moreover, they received an additional fixed amount of 20 EUR. The payout structure was
explained in the written instructions. Average payoff was 21.82 EUR. The study was conducted at (blinded for review), in compliance with the university’s ethical guidelines, and
following the recommendations for physiological measurements of the Society for Psychological Research (SPR). The experimental procedure is summarized in Figure 4.2. After
arrival at the laboratory, the participants were welcomed, heart rate and EEG measurement
equipment was set up in the participant’s cabin. Electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors were
attached first, followed by EEG electrode attachment, consuming roughly 10-12 minutes.
The experiment instructions (including payoff rules) were distributed in written form to
all participants and also read out aloud by our staff. Participants then answered a comprehension quiz with 6 questions to test their understanding of the instructions, followed by
2 trial rounds. After this, there was a 5 minute resting period, in which participants were
asked to sit idle, which is used to record a baseline level for the physiological data.

FIGURE 4.2: Experimental Procedure
In the main part of the experiment, each participant played 40 auctions (consuming
about 40 to 45 minutes). As can be seen in Figure 4.2, the auctions were broken down
into 5 iterations of 1 block of 4 FPSB and 1 block of 4 Dutch auctions, where in each
block of 4 auctions, two auctions used the low VU, and two auctions used the high VU
condition. This sequence within the blocks was determined randomly. Figure 4.3 shows
the sequence of events E1-E6 during one auction process. The first event in each auction
is the presentation of treatment information, and the private signal value (E1 in Figure 4.3
). Based on the private signal, each participant either submitted a sealed bid in a FPSB
auction, or engaged in a Dutch auction (E2). At the end of the bidding phase, three pieces
of information were displayed in intervals of 5 seconds, one after the other: (1) the result:
whether the participant won or not (E3) (2) the regret information: by displaying the bid

93

Chapter 4 Cognitive and affective processes in auction bidding
of the highest bidder for lost auctions (E4). (3) the payoff information (E5): the profit/loss
earned, taken as the difference between the winning bid and the true value in the current
round. Then participants clicked on a "Next" button to proceed to the next auction (E6).
After the experiment, electrodes were detached (consuming 2 minutes), and participants were asked to take several questionnaires, including demographic data (gender, and
age), the NASA TLX (Hart, 1988), and risk aversion (Holt and Laury, 2002) consumed
roughly 12-15 minutes.

process

4.3.4 Measures
Table 4.1 summarizes the operationalization of the factors in the research model and the
main statistic figures, as observed in the experiment. The trial rounds are not included in
the analysis. First, to operationalize emotional arousal (EA), heart rates of all participants
were measured before the experiment (baseline heart rate) and also before each bid. In
order to make heart rates comparable across participants, we normalized the heart rates
prior to the bid by dividing each value by a participant’s baseline heart rate. EA of a bid was
calculated by reducing the normalized heart rate values during the 3 to 1 seconds directly
prior to the bid to a single factor using Principal Component Analysis. An EA value of
0 represents an average level of emotional arousal, whereas a value of 1 represents an

94

4.3 Materials and Methods
arousal one standard deviation above average (across all participants and auctions). The
process is described in greater detail in Appendix C, where we also depict participants’
normalized heart rates for the different treatment conditions (Figure C.2).

95

Chapter 4 Cognitive and affective processes in auction bidding
Second, for cognitive workload (CW), we employed self-reported and physiological
measures based on EEG data. The CW values used in our analyses are based on the EEG
data. For the physiological measurement of cognitive workload, we adopted standard
procedures (Ortiz de Guinea,Ana and Webster, Jane, 2013). The cognitive workload index
for a bidder and auction was based on EEG data prior to event E2 (see Appendix C for a
detailed description). As can be seen in Table 4.1, the CW values ranged from 0.03 to 1.18,
where a value close to 0 corresponds to a "sleepy" state (low workload), and a value close
to 1 represents high cognitive workload or "high engagement" (Charland et al., 2014). To
measure perceived cognitive workload, the NASA TLX scale (Hart and Staveland, 1988)
was employed. Appendix C depicts differences between perceived and measured cognitive
workload (Figure C.1). Finally, based on their responses in the risk-aversion questionnaire
by Holt and Laury (2002), participants were categorized into risk averse or not risk averse.
In order to operationalize AD, we use an ordinal scale wherein 0 represents low AD (as
FPSB auction) and 1 represents high AD (as Dutch auction). We operationalize VU also on
an ordinal scale wherein 0 represents low VU (ε = 3 MU) and 1 represents high VU (ε = 12
MU). Bid Deviations (∆B) We assess participants’ bidding behavior in terms of deviations
from the "optimal bid" (Kagel Levin, 1986). In particular, we define bid deviations (∆B)
on a ratio scale (in MU) by calculating the absolute difference between the actual bid and
the optimal bid: ∆B = |Bid - Optimal Bid| (van den Bos et al., 2008). Kagel and Levin
(1986) showed that the optimal bid can be well approximated by means of the Risk Neutral
Nash Equilibrium (RNNE) bid function Y(x) = x - ε. The optimal bid is hence equal to the
lowest possible true value of the underlying good, based on the observed private signal
x and error term ε. It represents the bid that maximizes a bidders’ expected payoff. The
bid deviation can hence be written as follows: ∆B = |Bid - (x - ε)|. Due to the strategic
equivalence of Dutch and FPSB auctions, the definition of the optimal bid, and thus for
∆B, holds for both types of auctions.

4.4 Results
We first consider the overall impact of our treatment variables auction dynamics and value
uncertainty on bid deviations, i.e. (∆B = (|Bid - Optimal Bid|) MU). The most striking
result is that high value uncertainty yields much larger bid deviations than low uncertainty,
for both conditions of auction dynamics (Figure 4.4). Moreover, high auction dynamics
(Dutch), also yield generally larger bid deviations than low auction dynamics (FPSB). This

effect holds for both high and low value uncertainty. The impact of auction dynamics,
however, is visibly less pronounced than that of value uncertainty. An ANOVA confirmed
the relation to bid deviations statistically both for auctions dynamics (F(1, 875) = 15.36,
p<.001) and value uncertainty (F(1, 875) = 231.67, p<.001).
Having established the base effects of auction dynamics and value uncertainty, we now
consider the psycho-physiological measures emotional arousal (EA) and cognitive workload (CW). In a first step, we analyze these measures in in mixed-effects generalized least
squares (GLS) regressions with random intercepts for participants. Auction dynamics is
represented by a binary dummy variable, taking the value "1" for high dynamics (Dutch
auction format) and "0" for low dynamics (FPSB). Likewise, value uncertainty is also represented by a binary dummy ("1" for high, "0" for low value uncertainty). Moreover, we
include a dummy variable for risk aversion (Holt and Laury, 2002) and the variable Round,
ranging from 1 to 40, controlling for a possible linear trend in bid deviations over the
course of the experiment. As shown in Table 4.2, both factors EA (b=-.149, SE=.157) and
CW (b=1.953, SE=1.871) do not significantly affect bid deviations. In line with our finding
from above (on an aggregated level), high auction dynamics and high value uncertainty
both yield larger bid deviations. Moreover, the coefficient for Round is also significant
and negative, implying convergence towards the optimal bid, that is, learning among the
participants. Risk aversion, in contrast, does not yield any significant effects. We discuss
learning effects and findings on risk aversion in greater detail later on in this section.
We next examine, whether the impact of emotional arousal and cognitive workload on
bid deviations depends on the auction environment, i.e., whether there occur interaction
effects between the environmental and the psycho-physiological measures, as hypothesized in our research model.

4.4.1 The role of Auction Dynamics
We first consider the impact of emotional arousal and cognitive workload on bid deviations, depending on the different auction dynamics conditions (high/Dutch or low/FPSB).
For the analysis, we extend the regression models from above, including the respective
interaction terms. We consider the physiological measures at the moment prior to placing
the bid (corresponding to E2 in Figure 4.3 ). The results of the respective GLS regressions are summarized in Table 4.2. For the low AD/low VU baseline, Regression I reveals
that higher emotional arousal leads to significantly smaller bid deviations. One unit of

98

4.4 Results

FIGURE 4.4: Mean Deviations from RNNE in MU

99

Chapter 4 Cognitive and affective processes in auction bidding
emotional arousal decreases deviations by .468 MU (SE=.227, p<.05). High AD significantly increase deviations for average levels of emotional arousal, i.e., at EA=0 (b=.779,
SE=.341, p<.05).

100

4.4 Results
Importantly, emotional arousal in the presence of high auction dynamics, i.e. in Dutch
auctions, also increases deviations. The coefficient here is .635 (SE=.339, p<.05), which
overcompensates the effect of EA in FPSB auctions and hence transforms the mitigating
effect of EA into an aggravating one (.635 + (-.468) > 0). Our data hence supports H2.1,
i.e., that auction dynamics moderate the role of emotional arousal on deviations, such
that high auction dynamics increase the impact of emotional arousal on bid deviations.
Second, Regression II depicts the impact of cognitive workload on bid deviations and how
high auction dynamics alter its impact. Here, we neither find a significant base effect of
cognitive workload on deviations, nor do high auction dynamics change the picture. H2.2
is hence not supported.
Figure 4.5 depicts the differences in the component spectral plots, for the 16 channels
considered in the Independent Component Analysis stage, for Dutch and FPSB auctions
for one subject. Components with eye artifacts, have already been removed. By eyeball
inspection, the epicenter of spectral activity is different for channels 6, 8, 11, 12, 14 and
16, between the two treatments. For this particular subject, in Dutch auctions, spectral
activity is weaker in the frontal area (except channel 12) than in FPSB auctions. In the
remaining channels, there are no significant differences between the two treatments.

4.4.2 The role of Value Uncertainty
We now turn to the impact of emotional arousal and cognitive workload on bid deviations,
depending on the conditions of value uncertainty (low or high), again based on Regressions
I and II. First - for low AD and low VU as already noted above - higher emotional arousal
leads to significantly smaller bid deviations. High VU significantly increases deviations at
EA=0 (b=5.284, SE=.275, p<.001). In the high VU condition, the impact of EA on bid
deviations is not significantly altered (b=.364, SE=.282). Hence, even though the general
level of bid deviations is markedly higher in the high VU condition, it does not moderate
the impact of EA on bid deviations. H2.3 is thus not supported by our data.
Moving on to the moderating role of value uncertainty on the impact of cognitive workload on bid deviations (H2.4), Regression II shows that under high VU, there occurs significant additional impact of CW on deviations. One unit of cognitive workload (which
reflects the transition from its lowest to its highest observed values), here increases bid
deviations by 6.331 MU (SE=2.654, p<.05), whereas the effect is insignificant for low

VU (b=-1.828, SE=2.358). Our data hence supports hypothesis H2.4, i.e., that value uncertainty moderates the role of cognitive workload on bid deviations, where high value
uncertainty increases the impact of CW on bid deviations. Interestingly, when considering cognitive workload, the treatment variables themselves do not have a significant main
effect (Regression II, Table 4.3), possibly explained by high variance in the EEG data, as
reflected in the standard errors of the regression. To provide a more complete picture, we
conducted additional 3-way-interaction regressions including VU, AD, EA, CW, and the respective interaction terms as independent variables in Appendix C (Table C.1), the results
of which are consistent with the above findings.
Figure 4.6 depicts the differences in the component spectral plots, for the 16 channels
considered in the Independent Component Analysis stage, for low and high value uncertainty treatments, for one subject. Again, components with eye artifacts, have already
been removed. By eyeball inspection, it can be observed that the epicenter of spectral activity is different for channels 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16. For auctions with high
uncertainty, spectral activity is overall more pronounced (indicated by spectral acitvity in
red, for channels 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 16) than in low uncertainty, although not necessarily concentrated in the frontal area. In the remaining channels, there are no significant visible
differences between the two treatments.

4.4.3 Risk Aversion and Learning Effects
We now turn towards risk aversion and learning effects. For independent private value
models, higher individual risk propensity can only be reflected in lower bids (larger outcome variance). In contrast, common value models yield risk both for lower (chance for
particular high profits/ risk of not winning the auction), and higher bids (chance of winning the auction/ risk of experiencing the Winner’s Curse). In fact, as can be seen in the
regressions in Table 4.2 and Table 4.3, controlling for risk aversion does not yield any significant impacts on bid deviations. In line with Kagel and Levin (1986), the result suggests
that, for common value auctions, risk aversion does not generally push bids in one or the
other direction.
To examine and control for learning effects during the experiment, we included the
auction number (Round) as an independent variable into the regression. The results in
Tables 2 and 3 show that participants deviated less over the course of the experiment
(all coefficients between -.023 and -.028; all p-values below .05). The effect could be
explained by learning effects that might occur as participants learned from the auction
outcomes over time. Hence, bidders potentially adapted their bids to avoid losses due to
over or underbidding. The observation is in line with previous literature (Clemons and
Weber, 1996). However, comparing the standardized coefficients of the interaction effects

105

Chapter 4 Cognitive and affective processes in auction bidding
between EA and AD (5.302) and between CW and VU (7.280) with that of learning (-1.12,
-.96 respectively), it can be seen that the impact of the auction environment in determining
the extent to which internal processes increase deviations, is stronger than the mitigating
impact of learning. We hence suggest that the hypothesized interaction effects were not
affected by learning. A possible explanation is that the interval from which the private
value signals were drawn was large, i.e., [15, 100], such that participants had to newly
assess the situation in every round. The diminished learning effect is in line with Kagel
and Dyer (1988), who described learning in a similar common value setting as a "trial and
error learning process, which results in stable response functions that are not ’best replies’,
and in which agents fail to ’understand’ the underlying economic process, so that changes
in economic conditions result in sharp disruptions to the market, and the learning process
must repeat itself" (p. 184).

4.5 Discussion
4.5.1 Summary of Results and Theoretical Implications
Electronic markets and auctions in particular offer a perfect stage for the dynamic interplay of cognitive and affective processes. In the present study, we quantified cognitive
workload and emotional arousal by means of physiological measurements and examined
how specific (external) properties of the auction environment, i.e., auction dynamics and
value uncertainty, affect the impact of EA and CW on the bidders’ deviations from optimal
bids. We showed that the (external) auction environment is important for understanding the impact of internal processes (cognitive and affective) on bidding behavior. First,
the environmental factors auction dynamics and value uncertainty moderated the effects
of different internal processes on bid deviations. While auction dynamics moderated the
impact of emotional arousal (supporting H2.1), value uncertainty moderated that of cognitive workload (supporting H2.4). Second, the moderations were mutually exclusive i.e., auction dynamics did not moderate the impact of cognitive workload on bid deviations, and value uncertainty not that of emotional arousal (H2.2 and H2.3 not supported).
Third, both higher AD and higher VU increased the impact of their respective affective/
cognitive processes on bid deviations.
With respect to auction dynamics, we argue that participants are likely to be at ease
in a FPSB auction as the auction environment does not distort their emotional state, and

106

4.5 Discussion
hence are more likely to bid close to the optimal bid. The elements of excitement and
suspense in Dutch auctions may provide hedonic value but also lead to larger bid deviations
and hence lower overall individual payoffs (Adam et al., 2012a). Moreover, high auction
dynamics increased bidders’ reliance on emotional processes, while the role of cognition
remained unchanged. The picture was different for value uncertainty, however. High
value uncertainty, i.e., a potentially more challenging estimation process for the underlying
good’s true value, seemed to be associated with more pronounced processes of reflection,
generating a higher cognitive demand, and consequently increased bid deviations.
It is important to highlight that we pursue a moderation model to ascertain to what
extent environmental factors alter the relationship between internal processes and bid deviations. A moderator variable is one that influences the strength of a relationship between
two other variables (Baron and Kenny, 1986). In contrast, a mediator variable is one that
explains the relationship between the two other variables. In our study, a mediation model
could be employed to examine whether the intensities of internal processes mediate the
direct impact of the auction environment on bid deviations. However, a mediation analysis (Table 4.4) neither revealed significant indirect effects for emotional arousal nor for
cognitive workload. Hence, from a theoretical perspective, it cannot be stated that the
direct impact of auction dynamics and value uncertainty can be explained via the path of
different intensities in emotional arousal or cognitive workload. Rather, the nature of the
decision process changes with the auction environment, as the strength of the relationship
between bid deviations and internal processes changes.

107

Chapter 4 Cognitive and affective processes in auction bidding

4.5.2 Managerial Implications
While theoretically bidding behavior is determined as the result of a bidder’s internal processes (cognitive and/or affective), it is difficult if not impossible to disentangle how exactly internal processes lead to a decision. In fact, auctioneers in practice might choose to
abstract from or even completely ignore bidders’ underlying internal processes and focus
solely on the ultimate impact of environmental conditions on bid deviations. Final prices
are certainly one primary concern of practitioners, however, an understanding how the
external auction environment affects the impact of internal processes’ on bid deviations
also has several important managerial implications. First, understanding the importance
of cognitive and affective processes on bid deviations in a particular auction environment
can be useful for training purposes and de-biasing bidders. For instance, in contexts of
time pressure, bidders’ emotion regulation capabilities could be trained by providing live
biofeedback (Astor et al., 2013b). In contexts of value uncertainty, participants could be
trained to maintain their cognitive workload at an optimal level, in order to achieve better outcomes. Second, practical auction design builds on theoretical models of bidding
behavior, which are based on assumptions on bidders’ cognitive reasoning and emotional
arousal levels. Understanding the scenarios in which the importance of one or the other
internal process becomes more pronounced might be essential to challenge assumptions
and to test the robustness of existing theories in different types of auctions.
Electronic auctions are increasingly relevant for a wide range of industries. In the context of retailing, several e-commerce platforms realize a high percentage of their total
revenues through electronic auctions (e.g. DealDash, MadBid, 1-2-3.tv, and eBay). In
addition to e-commerce, auctions have proven to be particularly useful for emergency situations in health care (Smits and Janssen, 2008) or in crisis response management, where
immediate and dynamic re-allocations are necessary to respond to the situations in a timely
manner (Airy et al., 2009). Understanding the influences of external environment on human bidding would hence be useful in designing robust systems that proactively factor in
the relationship between internal processes and bid deviations. In the context of spectrum
auctions, Goeree and Offerman (2003) write that the auctions used to allocate spectrum
licenses represent examples of high common value uncertainty, and Kroemer et al. (2016)
show that bidders deviate significantly from optimal bids in the clock phase of spectrum
auctions. In our study, high value uncertainty impacts how cognitive workload affects
bid deviations. Hence, de-biasing in high uncertainty conditions should focus on cognitive rather than affective aspects of decision making. Secondly, auction format determines

Chapter 4 Cognitive and affective processes in auction bidding
how bidders’ emotional arousal impacts bidding. Hence, when aiming to minimize deviations from the optimal bid, we recommend applying an auction format which results in a
smaller influence of auction dynamics on bid deviations, as well as considering appropriate
de-biasing techniques (such as emotion regulation).
Overall, auction mechanisms should take the internal state of bidders into account, e.g.,
by designing adaptive systems (Feigh et al., 2012) that aid bidders to reduce deviations
from the optimal bid, drawing on emotion detection methods from physiological responses
(Hariharan and Adam, 2015). With respect to dynamics, the design element of time pressure should be administered with caution. One alternative would be to adopt the design of
slow Dutch auctions (e.g., 5 seconds instead of the 0.5 seconds per unit decrease), wherein
bidders’ heart rate was found to be significantly lower (Adam et al., 2012a). However, it
is important to note that the emotional arousal instigated through auction dynamics can
be also be source of hedonic value for the bidders, particularly in the domain of Internet
consumer auctions (Adam et al., 2015). Hence, auctioneers might deliberately decide to
increase auction dynamics to induce excitement on the platform despite ramification in
terms of larger bid deviations.

4.5.3 Limitations and Directions for Future Research
The present study has limitations which shall be discussed here. First, the optimal bid
function assumes bidders to be risk-neutral, while in fact risk propensity varies across
the population and most people tend to be slightly risk averse (Holt and Laury, 2002).
Kagel (1989) predicted that, assuming FPSB auctions and a common value model, riskaverse bidders would bid lower than the RNNE, and risk-affine bidders higher. To control
for such potential effects of individual risk aversion, we included a control variable in
our regression models, assessed using the Holt and Laury (2002) test. Individual risk
aversion, however, did not significantly affect bid deviations. How risk aversion (possibly)
varies over the course of the experiment and interplays with value uncertainty, auction
dynamics, emotional arousal, and cognitive workload needs further evaluation.
Second, other personality characteristics may impact how emotional arousal and cognitive workload affect behavior. For instance, emotion regulation strategies have shown to
impact the emotion levels experienced and also to affect decision-making (Gross and John,
2003). Similarly, time pressure might be perceived differently depending on how a participant appraises the situation (e.g., stress vs. positive challenge). For cognitive workload,

110

4.5 Discussion
individual differences in cognitive needs and abilities should also be taken into account
(Cacioppo and Petty, 1982). Such personality traits are likely to affect the interplay of the
EA, CW, and auction bidding. They are, however, beyond the scope of this work. Turning
to demographic factors, we did not consider physiological and behavioral variance due to
gender, age, or experiment/auction experience. In particular, gender effects have been
mentioned in several earlier auction studies (Ham and Kagel, 2006; Casari et al., 2005).
However, owing to the small sample size of our study, it was neither possible to uncover
systematic gender effects, nor possible to interpret the lack of significance with regard to
bid deviations. These factors hence warrant further research.
Third, in this experiment, participants interacted with computer bidders only. Many
auctions in e-commerce and competitive tendering procedures, however, are held among
humans. Recent research showed that affective processes are stronger when bidders interact with human opponents as opposed to human-computer interaction
In the current study, we have taken efforts to combine the two schools of thought,
namely the cognitive and the affective world in the context of auction bidding. To the
best of our knowledge, there exist to date no studies that have systematically investigated
the relationship between these factors at specific auction events (immediately prior to
placing a bid) using physiological measurements. The distinct role of affective processes
on bid deviations was evident for different levels of auction dynamics, whereas cognitive
workload affected bid deviations only in the presence of high value uncertainty. However,
the mentioned considerations are limited to only two aspects of the auction environment.
Further potentially important levers include other auction formats (English, Vickrey, or
Japanese), time pressure, and different levels of information granularity. Moreover, the
presented results should be contrasted against results obtained when using independent
private value (IPV), instead of common value (CV) models. Finally, a common explanation
for bid deviations is that bidders fail to adequately take into account that the winning
bidder is likely to have overestimated the true value of the good, that is, the winner’s
curse (Kagel and Levin, 1986; Casari et al., 2005). With as few as three or four bidders
per auction, Kagel and Levin (1986) showed that the winner’s curse was less pronounced
and bid deviations were smaller than for larger numbers of bidders. Hence, future work
should extend our experimental design to higher numbers of bidders per auction.

Chapter 4 Cognitive and affective processes in auction bidding

4.6 Conclusion
Turning to the research question RQ2 posed in the beginning of this chapter, it can be seen
that, in a group context of auction, the external influences of auction dynamics and value
uncertainty indeed moderate the role of integral arousal and cognitive workload (respectively) on RNNE bidding behavior. Specifically, the significant role of auction dynamics, in
moderating the role of emotional arousal on bidding behavior, has been observed in this
study. Secondly, value uncertainty was shown to moderate the role of cognitive workload
on bidding behavior. Hence, we argue that understanding the influence of external influences on bidding behavior, is improved by understanding the underlying affective and
cognitive processes that they impact. Both the cognitive and affective processes have a
significant role on bididng behavior, and need to be considered together in constructing
behavioral models. Auction design needs to consider changes in the impact of bidders’
internal states on bidding behavior based on changes in the auction environment. Decisions based on affective processes may provide a heuristic where there is insufficient time
for deliberation and reasoning. Real-time methods such as proposed by Fernández et al.
(2013), (Visser and Parasuraman, 2011), and Astor et al. (2013b) could be used to provide neuro-adaptive interfaces and biofeedback, which in turn may help to support bidders
to bid closer to the optimal bid. While we have not conducted the study where subjects
bid with other human subjects, but rather interacted with computer bidders, we believe
that the results may be observable in a human-human group setting as well, and this will
have to be verified in future work. In the next chapter, we look at the the influence of
integral arousal and cognitive workload in a context with the presence of other human
decision-makers, namely a serious game in cooperative and competitive modes.

Factors for performance differences in
interactive serious games

“

Competition has been shown to be useful up to a

certain point and no further, but cooperation, which is
the thing we must strive for today, begins where competition leaves off.
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT

5.1 Introduction
As stated in the epigraph, competition and cooperation, are two powerful influences, on
how we bind together socially, and how this in turn makes up group behavior. Whether
we behave in the same way when acting as an individual, as we function in a group, is
a pertinent and relevant question to address, specially in the context of group decisionmaking. For instance, deciding whether it is profitable to cooperate or not, is often a
non-trivial decision process, specially when the extent to which we involve ourselves is at
stake. A common example for this, would be the case of the public goods problem, where
people have to decide how much to commonly contribute to a common pool, which may be
viewed upon as an act of cooperation and sharing. As stated in the epigraph, in the larger
sense of the society, competition has shown to have its limitations, despite its immediately

113

Chapter 5 Factors for performance differences in interactive serious games
attractive elements, such as the gratification of winning. The case of cooperation is hence
argued, which is essential in order to achieve larger objectives not fulfilled by competition
- such as stability, or maximizing economic welfare.
Cooperative and competitive processes are also important to understand, in the context
of using information systems. Due to several reasons, using ICT for collaboration (or to
foster competition, for instance, by ranking methods), might be favorable to traditional
face-to-face methods. Using information tools might enable subtle and abstract representations of the contexts. It improves communication, by decreasing the need for explicit
communication, but rather relying on implicit communication. It might also aid in receiving live updates about others’ activities, or performance levels, which is often difficult
to achieve in a traditional face-to-face method. While these are definitely advantageous
from an organizational perspective (Te’eni, 2001), it is unknown, whether such information systems actually aid people, to perform better specially in cooperative and competitive
situations. To this end, in this chapter, we focus upon a specific case, where cooperation
and competitive modes are easy to elicit, with a readily available performance measure,
namely, serious games. In the context of serious games, we study the influence of various
factors, which might explain performance in the two modes of interaction.
Online collaboration and serious games are becoming increasingly common in both
work and private environments (McGonigal, 2011). Serious games are digital games that
are used for purposes other than pure entertainment (Susi et al., 2007). They usually have
a specific goal, such as education, training, or creating awareness on social issues. By using
a casual game to involve ordinary web users, Phylo, a human-based computing framework
applied "crowd sourcing" techniques to solve the computationally unsolvable Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) problem (Kawrykow et al., 2012) using pattern recognition skills
of the crowd. Games such as StrikeCom (Twitchell et al., 2005), are being designed to create group communication and interaction in multiple communication modes, for instance,
to teach warfare techniques to battle commanders. Other games enable participants with
widely varying backgrounds, motivations, and personal agendas to effectively and efficiently address complex problems, such as climate change (DeFrank and Hillyer, 2013;
McGoff et al., 1990).
The application of (serious) games to work environments has intensified interest in
theoretical and empirical research on what has been termed as the "multidimensional and
multilayered construct" of gameplay (Poels et al., 2007). In this paper, we seek to understand, to what extent elements of game design explain individual and group game

114

5.1 Introduction
performance. By understanding these determinants of game performance better, we extend these results to an organizational context, where designing games to help employees
increase their performance as well as feel comfortable is gaining interest (Mollick and
Rothbard, 2013; Reeves and Read, 2013).
To exploring performance differences between individuals, a number of factors have
been identified as relevant in literature. These are broadly characterized as being contextual and personality-related (LePine and van Dyne, 2001; Mischel and Shoda, 1995).
Contextual factors - which describe features of the individual’s environment - focuses on
rules, tasks and rewards (Richardson et al., 2012), and changes in these parameters have
shown to enhance performance. On the other hand, personality-related factors generally
fall into two categories. The first is concerned with stable characteristics, leading to idiosyncratic behavior across many contexts and for a reasonably long period of time, such as
personality traits (Feldmann et al., 2014), need for cognition (Cacioppo and Petty, 1982)
or emotion regulation skills (Gross and John, 2003). The other category comprises of
dynamic processes that vary widely within an individual, between contexts and in comparatively short time intervals, such as emotions (Astor et al., 2013) or attention, and
cognitive workload (Li et al., 2014).
To this end, the overarching research question we explore in this chapter, is as follows:
RQ3: In a social context, how do external influences (cooperative and competitive
game playing mode), and personality-related factors (characteristics and internal
processes) impact individual and group game performance?
The fact that contextual and personality-related features are highly interrelated makes
explaining and predicting individual (as well as group) performance a challenging research
task (Farh et al., 2012). In this paper, we orient ourselves to the cognitive-affective personality system by (Mischel and Shoda, 1995), to examine the interrelationships between
(1) two contextual factors: social interaction settings and gender formation, (2) stable
characteristics: namely emotion regulation, and need for cognition, and (3) dynamic internal processes: namely emotions and cognitive workload; on individual and group game
performance.
To this end, we conducted a laboratory experiment in which participants played a pattern recognition game in two modes - cooperative and competitive - and measured the
above factors in questionnaires. First, we find that game performance depended on contextual setting: participants performed better in cooperative than in competitive mode,

115

Chapter 5 Factors for performance differences in interactive serious games
and male participants performed better than females. Second, personality-related factors
partially explained this difference. Of the stable characteristics: engaging in emotion reappraisal led to a better performance across game playing modes. Analyses on the group level
showed that some personality-related factors (such as need for cognition) - while largely
irrelevant on the individual level - played a large role in determining group performance.
Third, dynamic processes of emotion significantly predicted game performance, whereas
the process of cognitive workload was not equally significant. This result highlights that
emotional (and experiential) influences impact game performance more readily, than cognitive processes.
This chapter is structured as follows. First, we provide theoretical background and relevant literature on factors that drive performance differences in games. Second, we outline
the experiment design, the procedure in collecting the data, and describe the measures
employed. Third, we present the results, discuss their implications, and propose possible
directions for future research.

5.2 Theoretical Background
We consider the question of human behavior in serious games from an "interactionist" point
of view (Zhao, 2005) - i.e., to explain human behavior by what is known as triadic interactions between person, environment, and behavior (Lewin, 2013; Bandura, 1986; Mischel
and Shoda, 1999; Funder, 2006). To encompass these triadic interactions, Mischel and
Shoda (1995) provide a framework: the cognitive-affective personality system (CAPS).
The components of the CAPS framework have been enlisted as encodings, expectancies
and beliefs, affects, goals and values, competencies and regulation skills. First, humans
encode features of the environment (i.e. mentally classifying or representing the self, other
people, and events). These encodings then interact with the other components of CAPS to
generate a pattern of inhibition and activation (e.g., encoding a situation as "physical danger" and encoding the self as "self-defense expert" may give rise to expectancies of attaining
the goal of "surviving unharmed" successfully and serve to increase confidence and efficacy beliefs). The result of the encoding process and the subsequent interactions between
the cognitive-affective components is then manifested as a specific behavior (Mischel and
Shoda, 1995).
The CAPS model has been applied in the IS domain, in order to model organizational

116

5.2 Theoretical Background
communication and to design appropriate IT communication systems (Te’eni, 2001). We
apply the CAPS model to the domain of serious games as a means of developing appropriate
gaming environments for purposes other than entertainment (e.g., training, education, or
work collaboration).
Several taxonomies have been proposed in literature that encompasses the different
kinds of psychologically relevant features, in situations and situation characteristics (Rauthmann et al., 2014; van Heck, 1984). We focus open two factors, which have proven to be
highly deterministic of game performance, and are also applicable to organizational contexts. The first contextual factor of serious games we consider is the social interaction
setting - whether the game mode is one of competition or cooperation. The second one we
consider is that of gender: whether female players differ significantly from male players.
With these contexts, we attempt to shed light on how certain dispositional variables (i.e.,
personality factors) interact with these contextual factors to activate cognitive-affective
personality processes and which behaviors will result from these interactions

FIGURE 5.1: Research Model

5.2.1 Game context and Game Performance
Game playing modes may be broadly classified as (i) individualistic: where one’s actions have no effect on others, (ii) cooperative: where individual actions promote the
goals of others, (iii) competitive: where individual actions obstruct others’ actions, and
(iv) cooperative-competitive: e.g., multiplayer games in which players compete with each
other as groups (Liu et al., 2013).

117

Chapter 5 Factors for performance differences in interactive serious games
In the context of cooperative games and player motivation, the bounded generalized
reciprocity behavior - which proposes that people will behave positively toward those who
are expected to reciprocate such behaviors, thus effectively protecting and furthering one’s
self-interest - could be the underlying theory behind cooperative behavior (Velez, 2015).
In accordance with this, it has been shown that playing with a helpful teammate increased
the tendency of in-group members to reciprocate pro-social behaviors, as well as led to
increases in pro-social behaviors between teammates (Velez, 2015). Also, the fundamental
aspects of cooperation (such as an environment that fosters welfare, and makes game play
more interesting) could be a performance driver by itself (Liu et al., 2013). A cooperative
goal structure was found to lead to greater effort put into the game than a competitive goal
structure (Peng and Hsieh, 2012). Even merely referring to the average social payoff has
shown to foster game performance, and promote cooperation in a simulation-based spatial
prisoner dilemma’s games (Shigaki et al., 2012). In summary, prior research suggests that
cooperative game elements buoy up game motivation and performance.
Turning to the other social mode of interaction in games, competition has shown to
influence the degree of user engagement in the game, as well as impact the motivation
to expend effort (Peng and Hsieh, 2012). For instance, in first person shooter games, it
was shown that competitive interaction motives were the strongest predictors of the time
actually spent on gaming (Jansz and Tanis, 2007). On a broader level, the user’s feeling
of playing against an opponent is likely to evoke a social-competitive situation that should
be capable of engaging and involving the user (Vorderer et al., 2003). Empirical game
experiments have shown that competition and challenges in the game motivate students
to achieve better performance during a web-based problem-solving activity (Hwang et al.,
2012). However, in multiplayer browser games, the social relationships involved in game
play seem to be more important than competition, in comparison to other game types
(Klimmt et al., 2009). As a consequence of the above research, we infer that while social
elements of game play might be a significant driver of game performance, it remains to
be compared empirically whether people perform better in cooperative or in competitive
modes of game play. Taking the above together, we formulate our first hypothesis as:
Hypothesis 3.1: Game players in a cooperative game mode have a better performance than when playing in competitive game mode.
Several studies indicate gender differences in digital gaming engagement and performance. Gender has revealed to be a significant indicator of video gaming engagement:
males are almost twice as likely to be engaged in gaming as females (Hoffman and Nadel-

118

5.2 Theoretical Background
son, 2010). Female respondents’ ratings of fictional video games demonstrated that lack of
meaningful social elements, followed by violent content and sexual gender role stereotyping of game characters, were the most important reasons why females disliked the games.
A second study revealed that female respondents were less attracted to competitive elements in video games, suggesting an explanation for gender-specific game preferences
(Hartmann and Klimmt, 2006). Studies have found that games requiring specific cognitive skills - such as spatial attention, or spatio-temporal skills are received differently by
males and females. For instance, first-person shooter action games have shown to appeal
to boys rather than girls (Quaiser-Pohl et al., 2006; Terlecki and Newcombe, 2005). In
pattern recognition tasks, by varying the number of figures in the pattern, studies suggest
that males rely more on a match-jump strategy: once males have identified the matching
target, they jump to the next problem without verifying the remaining stimuli, which presumably do not match, and thus progress through the test more quickly and have a chance
to respond to more questions. In contrast, females tend to match every single figure to the
target, even after identifying a match, and thus do not advance through the test as quickly,
and often are unable to finish tests that have a fixed time limit (Glück and Fabrizii, 2010;
Hirnstein et al., 2009). Hence, taking the above together, we expect that gender formation
and the gender context, explain differences in game performance significantly. Based on
the above research, we herewith derive our next hypothesis as follows:
Hypothesis 3.2: Male participants have a better game performance than female
participants.

5.2.2 Personality Factors and Game Performance
Preference for a specific game playing mode, and the performance thereof, might be driven
by personality-related factors. The first set of factors we consider is comprised of characteristics which are likely to remain (relatively) stable over time. To this end, we consider
one characteristic each that may be mapped to competencies and regulation skills (Mischel
and Shoda, 1995). Specifically, we consider (1) the characteristic of emotion regulation
strategy, as a proxy for a regulation skill, and to be mapped later to the dynamic process
of emotion and (2) the characteristic of need for cognition, as a proxy for understanding
competencies, to be mapped later to the dynamic process of cognitive workload. In the
following, we derive the corresponding hypotheses to study their relationships with game
performance.

119

Chapter 5 Factors for performance differences in interactive serious games
Emotion regulation strategies refer to the different ways in which response tendencies
to an emotion may be modulated (Gross and John, 2003). Emotion regulation strategies
may be broadly categorized as antecedent and response focused strategies, depending on
when they occur in the emotion generative process. We focus on cognitive reappraisal
and suppression as two representative strategies for each of the two categories. Cognitive
reappraisal is an antecedent emotion regulation strategy that involves changing the way
one thinks about a stimulus in order to change its affective impact (Buhle et al., 2014).
Emotion suppression, on the other hand, is a response-focused strategy that aims at regulating emotions by suppressing those that have already emerged (Gross and John, 2003).
Previous work has shown that the behavioral consequences of the two strategies are different. Reappraisal leads to enhanced positive emotion, less intensive negative emotion,
and hence bears positive social consequences (Gross, 2002). Reappraisal strategy has been
shown to be beneficial to decision-making, particularly in risky situations (Heilman et al.,
2010). Suppression, on the other hand, masks social signals that would otherwise be available to partners, and can have adverse social consequences. Prior experimental research
indicates that individuals who habitually suppress their emotions are less likely to share
positive and negative emotions alike, and are associated with poorer social support (Gross,
2002). Thus, taking the above together, we hypothesize that the type of emotion regulation strategy (reappraisal/suppression) employed by a person, affects game performance,
depending on the gaming context.
Hypothesis 3.3: Emotion regulation strategy moderates the impact of game context on game performance.
Need for cognition describes the willingness and the tendency of a person to engage
in effortful cognitive activity, and plays a role in determining to which extent a person is
motivated to engage in social activity (Kearney et al., 2009). In the realm of digital games,
cognitive benefits of gaming have been cited as a strong reason for player performance.
Games provide the player with a rich environment from which cognition is not only developed but also enhanced by the provision of input within the scenario itself (Smith, 2004).
For example, (adolescent) gamers typically perform better on tests of processing speed
and visuospatial functioning than non-gamers (Green and Bavelier, 2003). While several
studies report the cognitive benefits of continuous gaming (Green and Bavelier, 2006) on
different age groups (Allaire et al., 2013) and gender (Feng et al., 2007), so far there is
little work that specifically explores the impact of need for cognition on players’ performance in different modes. For instance, players with a higher need for cognition might
only perform well if positively influenced by the gaming context. Hence we further explore

120

5.2 Theoretical Background
this relation, how an individual’s need for cognition is related to their performance levels
in different game contexts.
Hypothesis 3.4: Need for cognition moderates the impact of game context on game
performance.

5.2.3 Internal Processes and Game Performance
As the final set of factors that impact game performance, we next consider dynamic internal processes as influences on game behavior: namely affective and cognitive processes.
To obtain a theoretical understanding of which processes underlie game performance, we
orient ourselves to the dual processing theory. Briefly summarized, it states that individuals are primarily influenced by two systems: the deliberative and cognitive system,
and the effortless and affective system. Lieberman (2007) posits that these two systems
and the associated internal processes thereof determine how individuals experience and
react to their environment. These two processes are modeled with the two proxies of
emotional arousal and cognitive workload. Since games promise elements of enjoyment,
game-playing is likely to be accompanied by sensory experiences in the form of arousal. In
this paper, arousal is referred to as the intensity of affective processes accompanying game
play. Arousal needs to be distinguished from flow theory, wherein a heightened arousal
of sensory and cognitive stimulation could occur due to continuous engagement and complete absorption in the game (Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). While flow theory implies better
game performance due to complete absorption in the game, arousal does not necessarily
imply complete absorption, but may still influence game score.
Emotions of gratitude, sharing and giving, foster cooperative behavior, even when it is
at the expense of individual benefits. While emotions of inhibition reduced cooperation,
positive emotions increased cooperation (Rand et al., 2015). In other words, most cooperative individuals had high positive emotion and low inhibition, whereas reflective or
deliberative processing may undermine cooperative behavior by suppressing the prosocial
effects of positive emotion. Turning to the competitive context, competition is a powerful
stimulus that can create emotional responses of arousal, manifesting both as heightened
activity and motivation in the game, or even as rivalry (Vorderer et al., 2003). In an auction
context, competition has shown to fuel arousal, which in turn impairs decision-making (Ku
et al., 2005). In digital games, players who compete with opponents of similar skill levels

121

Chapter 5 Factors for performance differences in interactive serious games
tend to apply more effort, while playing against opponents with lower skills increases enjoyment and decreases arousal (Liu et al., 2013). Hence, in a competitive setting, arousal
is additionally likely to impact game score. Taking the above together, along with the CAPS
framework, it is likely that the level of emotional arousal drives performance, depending
on whether a player is in cooperative or competitive mode, or whether the context is a
male or a female setting. We formulate the next hypothesis as follows:
Hypothesis 3.5: Emotion mediates the impact of game context on game performance.
With regard to cognitive processes, we examine the impact of cognitive workload on
game performance. Cooperative game-playing mode has been shown to demand far lesser
(aggressive) cognition to be expended (Schmierbach, 2010). The impact of cognitive
workload in a cooperative context comes with the mental cost of factoring in another
person’s behavior. However, providing cooperative assistance (through additional agents)
might reduce the individual cognitive workload during a task. In competitive contexts, it
has been shown that cognitive stress that occurs post-match is predictive of performance,
as well as of subsequent stresses experienced (Scanlan and Lewthwaite, 1984). Taking
the above together, it is likely that the level of experienced cognitive workload changes
according to the cooperative and competitive setting, but it is not known whether it influences game performance positively or negatively, and if so, to what extent. Orienting to
the CAPS framework, we hypothesize the mediating influence of the dynamic process of
cognitive workload, as follows:
Hypothesis 3.6: Cognitive workload mediates the impact of game context on game
performance.

5.3 Method
In the following section, we detail the experiment design, followed by the task description.
The procedure and the measures to quantify the factors in the research model are then
described.

122

5.3 Method

5.3.1 Experiment Design
This study examines factors that explain performance differences in different modes of
game play. We use a 2x2 within-subject design with the two treatment variables game
playing mode and gender. The variable game playing mode has two levels, cooperative
(COOP) and competitive (COMP) mode, where groups of two players interact. For the variable gender, we considered two levels of groupwise gaming between players: male-male
and female-female. Homogeneity of group formation with respect to gender facilitates
comparison of gender interactions. In all treatments, participants repeatedly played a pattern recognition game. To ensure comparability between treatments, the basic rules of
playing were identical across treatments.

5.3.2 Description of Task
In order to operationalize the search task (individually, and as a group), we utilize a pattern
recognition game, which is a common application domain of serious games. In order to
maintain high levels of experimental control, we use a context-free version of pattern
recognition. The game’s objective was to identify the correct pattern from amongst 20
candidate patterns. To ensure consistency, playing time for each round was set to 7 seconds
and the number of rounds played was held constant across participants and treatments.
The patterns consisted of a sequence of 5 symbols (upward triangle, downward triangle,
rhombus, square and circle). In each round of game play, the pattern to be identified
was drawn without replacement from the 5 symbols, and the 20 candidate patterns were
drawn from 120 (i.e., 5!) possible patterns with replacement.
The scoring rules - and consequently the payoff - differed between COOP and COMP
treatments. In the COOP treatment, participants gained 5 points each for themselves and
their partner for a correct click (henceforth referred to as a hit). Likewise, participants
lost 5 points for themselves and their partner each in case of an incorrect click (henceforth
referred to as a miss). By contrast, in the COMP treatment, participants gained 15 points
for a hit, but the opponent lost 5 points. For a miss, the participant lost 15 points, but
the opponent gained 5 points. In both treatments, participants were not penalized for
refraining from clicking in a round (henceforth referred to as unclicked). Hence, in both
treatments, participants’ payoffs were dependent on their own performance as well as their
partner’s (opponent’s) performance. Figure 5.2 shows one participant’s’ game screen for

123

Chapter 5 Factors for performance differences in interactive serious games
the COOP treatment, and the score table is given in Table 5.1. The COMP treatment
screens were identical.

FIGURE 5.2: Experiment Screenshot in Cooperative Mode
In order to enhance participants’ sense of cooperative and competitive gameplay, we
included a performance history for participant and partner on the gaming screens that
tracked game performance in each treatment. Performance was displayed both as a table
(green text color - hits; red text color - misses; table on the middle right of the screens in
Figure 5.2), and as a graph (bottom right of the screens in Figure 5.2). Participant’s own
performance was colored in black, and the partner’s (opponent’s) performance was colored
in pink. In addition, a blinking message was shown below the search pattern after each
clicking action. S/he would receive a blinking message on his/her screen with the message
"Your partner (opponent) won/lost x points for you" if the partner (opponent) contributed
to (reduced) his or her score. Finally, participants were shown the time available for each

5.3.3 Procedure
The experimental procedure is depicted in Figure 5.3. In order to avoid potential carryover effects, perfect stranger matching was employed. Participants were matched with
different partners in cooperative and competitive modes. To control for order effects,
treatment order A (COOP, COMP) was played in half the sessions while in the other half,
treatment order B (COMP, COOP) was played. Prior to the experiment, participants received instructions in writing as well as in audio, about the pattern recognition task, the
treatments, the scoring tables (including own and others’ game performance), the performance history elements on the treatment screens and the perfect-stranger matching. To
ensure that participants understood the instructions correctly, a short comprehension quiz
was administered. This was followed by a training phase in which participants played the
game in individual mode for 1 minute to familiarize them with the game.
The first treatment (COOP or COMP depending on treatment order) was then played
for 5 minutes, thus permitting 42 rounds of gameplay of 7 seconds each and a corresponding number of clicks. The treatment was concluded by a result screen informing
the participants of their game score and payoff. A subsequent pause of 30 seconds gave
participants the opportunity to mentally disengage from the preceding treatment and prepare for the next treatment (COMP or COOP depending on treatment order). The second
treatment was also played for 5 minutes, or 42 rounds, and concluded by a result screen
for this treatment. Participants were then shown another screen with their overall payoff
from both treatments. Thereafter, participants answered questionnaires on demographic
data, emotion regulation strategies (Gross and John, 2003), need for cognition (Cacioppo
and Petty, 1982), prosocial and intrinsic motivation (Grant, 2008); and emotion (Mano,
1991), and workload levels (NASA-TLX,Hart and Staveland (1988)) for each treatment.
Finally, participants were paid out based on their game earnings (computed as 5% of the

125

Chapter 5 Factors for performance differences in interactive serious games
cumulative earnings in both treatments).
Finally, in addition to reports on cognitive workload, and emotional levels, psychophysiological measures of brain activity, HR, and SCR were captured via sensors. For measurement of brain activity, a 32-channel EEG device of Brain Products was used, to record the
electrical activity in the outer layer of the brain, namely the cerebral cortex. Signals were
sampled at 500 Hz, band-pass filtered at 0.01 to 100 Hz, and checked for eye-blink artefacts. The EEG Workload index mirrors the theoretical definition of cognitive workload,
taking into account the absolute and relative power spectra from 1 to 40 Hz of EEG channel. For measurement of SCR and HR, Ag/AgCl electrodes were connected to the Bioplux
(2007) sensor system, and transmitted via Bluetooth.

FIGURE 5.3: Experiment Procedure
In order to test participants’ interaction with the experimental system, find potential
flaws in the software, and parameterize the timer, a pilot study with 20 participants was
conducted. Each session had 4 participants. The results of the pilot study indicated that
participants indeed noticed the differences in game playing modes, and played differently
depending on the social setting. In addition, 7 seconds was reported as being challenging,
but as being exciting as well. Hence we retained our design choices in implementing the
experiment with 7 seconds for each round of pattern recognition.
The main study was conducted with 156 participants. 76 were male and 80 were female. 4 participants were invited to all-male or all-female sessions. Overall, 39 experimental sessions were held. Participants were recruited using ORSEE (Greiner, 2004),
filtering on gender. The study was conducted in compliance with the university’s ethical
guidelines.

5.3 Method

5.3.4 Measures
We dummy-coded the treatment variables gender (male=0, female =1) and game-playing
mode (COOP=0, COMP=1). We used four well-known and widely used self-reported
scales to quantify personality-related characteristics and the internal processes.
For measuring the emotion regulation strategies of participants, we classified whether
participants were primarily reappraisers or suppressors, by employed the emotion regulation questionnaire (ERQ) as described by (Gross, 2002). Emotion regulation strategies of
participants were classified as reappraisal and suppression, based on their average scores
in the 6 items for reappraisal, and 4 items for suppression. Participants’ need for cognition was measured with the 18-item scale developed by (Cacioppo and Petty, 1982). The
overall need for cognition score was then computed as the difference between the sum of
scores on 9 positively correlated items, and 9 negatively correlated items to the underlying
construct. The need for cognition score has a range of [-45, 45].
The internal processes were assessed with two self-reported measures. For assessing
emotions experienced during game play, we used the scale developed by Mano (1991),
of which 6 emotions were considered (active, aroused, nervous, surprised, excited, calm,
and sleepy), once for each treatment (COOP and COMP). For measuring cognitive workload, we utilized a reduced version of the NASA-TLX scale (Hart and Staveland, 1988).
In the context of our study, stationary digital gameplay, the dimension "physical demand"
is not relevant and was thus omitted. The 5 remaining relevant dimensions are mental
demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration. Participants provided
their cognitive workload ratings for both treatments (COOP and COMP) and also reported
their weights for each of these dimensions. The reported cognitive workload index was
computed as a weighted mean of the scores on each of these 5 dimensions.
Finally, in order to quantify game performance in the two modes, we used three measures of game performance, namely hits (when the pattern was recognized correctly),
misses (when the pattern is recognized incorrectly), and unclicked (when no pattern is
clicked). While both the measures of hits and misses can be considered as willingness
to expend effort, the measure of unclicked can be viewed as unwillingness to participate,
possibly due to lack of time to find the pattern within the time, boredom, inattentiveness
or due to loss aversion. The maximum number of clicks per treatment was 42 (each treatment lasted for 300 seconds / every 7 seconds another pattern was displayed). In a similar
method, group performance was calculated as 42 possible clicks per treatment times the

127

Chapter 5 Factors for performance differences in interactive serious games
maximum group payoff (10 points) if both team members recognized the pattern correctly,
bringing the maximum group payoff to 420 points in both game modes. In the following
section, we proceed to test the proposed research model using the above measures.

5.4 Results
Figure depicts the distribution of participants’ game performance in cooperative and competitive modes of game play. A preliminary analysis of the data with a repeated ANOVA
showed that the means were significantly different for hits for the two game modes (F=1.442,
p<.05) and significantly different for the two gender groups as well (F=7.704, p<.01).
The means of misses and unclicked did not differ significantly between the two game
modes, but only differed across the gender groups (Figure 4 depicts the corresponding
charts). We examine differences in game performance in detail in the following.

FIGURE 5.4: Boxplot Distribution of game performance measures for game environments.

5.4.1 Impact of game context on game performance
Table 5.2 shows the results of the logistic regressions. The response variable in regression I
is the probability of the given click to be a hit, given the distribution function of these three
measures (0-42). In regressions II and III, we conducted additional logistic regressions on
the dependent variables "probability of misses" and "probability of unclicked" in the total
number of trials. Regression I shows that participants had significantly fewer hits (B=0.143, SE=0.052, p<.01) in competitive mode than in cooperative mode. Similar patterns

128

5.4 Results
were also visible for misses (B=.163, SE=.096, p<.10) and unclicked (B=.106, SE=.055,
p<.10), with more misses and unclicked for competitive than in cooperative mode. Hence,
we conclude that there are indeed significant differences in game performance with better
performance in cooperative than in competitive mode, highlighting the important role
of the interaction mode on game performance (H3.1). The difference in performance
between the two modes is illustrated further in the following results as well.

questionnaires).
The effect of the gender setting that one is in, is significant across all three performance
measures. Regressions I - III reveal that females had fewer hits, more misses and more
unclicked, in comparison to males, all significant at the 0.001 level. This hence provides
support for H3.2, that male participants have a better individual performance than female
participants. This result is also confirmed by the regression in Appendix D (Table D.1),
which summarizes the analogous result for group performance.

5.4.2 Impact of personality characteristics on game performance
We next turn to the moderating effect of the personality characteristics on game performance. To do this, we test for potential differences in performance, arising due to the
interaction of emotion regulation strategy, and need for cognition, with the treatment

129

Chapter 5 Factors for performance differences in interactive serious games
factors. These results are summarized in Table 5.5 (for individual performance) and Appendix D, Table D.1 (for group performance). In the case of individual performance, it can
be seen that reappraisers performed better and had more hits (B=.154, SE=.035, p<.001)
and fewer unclicked (B=-.164, SE=.037, p<.001). Personality traits of suppression and
need for cognition were, however, not significantly explaining individual game performance. Examining the interaction effects of the characteristics on game context, the only
significant effect was that female reappraisers performed worse than male reappraisers,
shown in fewer hits (B=-.082, SE=.038, p<.05), and more unclicked (B=.086, SE=.039,
p<.05). Other interaction effects of personality characteristics (suppression, need for cognition) with game context were not significant predictors of individual performance. This
hence provides support for H3.3, that personality traits of emotion regulation moderates
the impact of game context on performance, whereas H3.4 is not supported.

questionnaires).
In the case of group performance (Appendix D,Table D.1), it can be seen that the im-

130

5.4 Results
pact of the personality characteristics are more pronounced than in the case of individual
characteristics. Specifically, groups with a high aggregated need for cognition performed
better in competitive mode, but worse in cooperative mode. Groups with high reappraisal
scores performed better, whereas groups with high suppressor scores performed worse in
both game modes. The interaction effects with gender are also significant predictors of
group game performance. Specifically, female reappraisers had lower group performance
than male reappraisers, in both cooperative and competitive modes, and this is visible in
the individual performance as well. In addition, in competitive mode, female suppressors
had better performance than male suppressors, and females with a high need for cognition
performed better than males. Thus, this provides partial support for H3.3 and H3.4. However, this difference in influence between individual and group characteristics on game
performance is an interesting one, and warrants further research.

5.4.3 Impact of internal processes on game performance
We next assess the influences of internal processes on performance, by examining the impact of emotional arousal and cognitive workload, as a theoretical approach to why performance differences might exist, due to the game context. Table contains the mediation
analysis for H3.5 and H3.6. It can be seen here, that emotion indeed mediates the impact
of game mode on game performance, leading to more hits (B=.311, p<.05), and fewer
misses (B=-.181, p<.05) thus providing support for H3.5. However, a similar mediating
effect of cognitive workload on game performance was not significantly visible in any of the
performance measures (hits, misses, unclicked), thus invalidating H6. This result hence
provides support for the notion that emotional processes underlie game performance, and
explain differences that might arise due to the game context, whereas cognitive workload
might not be an equally strong mediator. Comparing these results by splitting the data for
the two gender treatment levels revealed that the mediation effect was acting in the same
direction, and to a comparable effect size, across both genders, thus providing further
support for H3.5.
We finally examine a variant of the last two hypotheses, H3.5 and H3.6, to test whether
the personality characteristics moderate the mediating influence of the internal processes
on performance. From Appendix D, Table D.2, it can be observed that participants with a
higher reappraiser indeed impacted the mediating influence of emotion on game performance. Particularly, reappraisers with high emotion levels scored better than reappraisers

with a low emotion score. On the other hand, need for cognition was a significant moderator of cognitive workload when the score was 20 (towards the higher end of the scale).
Thus, while the dynamic process of cognitive workload did not directly mediate the impact of mode on performance, taken together with the need for cognition score, led to
significantly lower individual performance.
Figure 5.5 depicts how participants’ correctness score varied with each position, amongst
the possible 20 positions on the screen. As can be observed, participants had highest number of correct clicked, whenever the target pattern was at positions 0, 5, 10, 15, etc., i.e,
the left-most position in a given row. This result is intuitive, since participants would normally search for patterns from left to right, thus denoting highest success rate whenever
the position was in the left-most position. However, a regression analysis of the hits, on the
position, revealed that the positioning of the target pattern was not necessarily significant,
i.e., position alone was not sufficient to determine correctness of a hit.
Addressing the question, to which extent contextual and personality-related factors determine performance on a group level, we performed logistic regressions analogous to
the above. Performance on the group level was measured in terms of group payoff. The
dependent variable was the proportion of group payoff in the maximum possible group
payoff. Since we used perfect stranger matching to re-match groups between treatments,
we performed two separate regressions for each game-playing mode. Table 5.5 shows the
logistic regressions on payoff in cooperative and competitive mode.
The results for gender and excitement are similar to those obtained on the individual
level (Table 5.2). Excited groups earned, on average, higher payoffs (Table 5.5). Excited
male groups performed better than excited female groups, and this also explains the gender
difference in the payoff in both modes (Figure 5.6). Interestingly, personality characteristics which were not significant in explaining individual game performance turned out to
be significant in explaining group game performance. High intrinsic motivation improved
group performance in both modes, whereas high prosocial motivation was associated with
worse group performance in the competitive mode and had no influence in cooperative
mode. Groups with higher aggregate need for cognition scores performed worse in both
cooperative and competitive modes. Higher aggregate suppression scores were related to
worse performance across modes. Lastly, higher aggregated reappraisal scores led to better
group performance in cooperative mode (B=0.039, SE=0.017, p<.05), and worse group
performance in competitive mode (B=-.034, SE=0.014, p<.05). The latter is a surprising
result, since reappraisers had a consistently better performance on the individual level.

While taking the arithmetic mean, might indeed be representative of the individual
scores, it is possible, that the mean is not the only possible method to aggregate scores both from a mathematical and from an applicability point of view. For instance, considering differences, ratios, or products of personality attributes, might be equally (or even
more) informative, in understanding the impact of individual personality attributes on
game performance. To this end, we compare how the different aggregate scores perform,
in comparison to the arithmetic mean, for both the cooperative, and the competitive modes
of play. Table 5.6 depicts these regressions.
It could be seen that, participants aggregated best, on the basis of their differences, in
trying to explain performance in cooperative mode. While not true of all characteristics,
it may be observed that in general, groups with larger differences in attributes, tended to
perform worse (Excited, Reappraisal, Need for cognition, prosocial motivation) in cooperative mode. But what needs to be highlighted is that, models that looked at differences in
attributes, performed the best in terms of Hosmer R2 measure. On the other hand, in competitive mode, groups with higher mean scores, performed better, and in general, it was
most informative to look at the average of scores (by means of the Hosmer R2 masure), as
a predictor for group performance. Hence it appears possible, that averages define performance in competitive mode much better, whereas differences explain cooperative behavior
much stronger.

5.5 Discussion
Our study contributes to understanding performance differences in cooperative and competitive serious games in a search context. Our aim was to define and understand the
interplay of game contextual factors, personality-related factors (stable characteristics of
emotion regulation, need for cognition respectively mapped to dynamic internal processes
of emotional arousal and cognitive workload), and how these factors relate to individual
and group game performance. We find that dynamic processes and stable characteristics
of the individual as well as group characteristics play an important role in determining
players’ game performance in cooperative and competitive game play. These add weight
to the cognitive-affective personality system (Mischel and Shoda, 1995) that advocates
the study of context, dynamic processes, along with stable personality characteristics, to
obtain a holistic picture with respect to behavior.
Specifically, we found that participants performed better in cooperative than in competitive mode, and males performed better than females, across all game performance
measures, highlighting the role of contextual factors in defining game performance. Second, personality characteristics partially moderated this influence of context: reappraisers
performed better, whereas other characteristics (of suppression and need for cognition)
were only relevant on the group level. Third, our results indicate that dynamic factors,
in particular affective processes, were important in determining game performance, lead-

136

5.5 Discussion
ing to better game performance. Thus, emotional processes are an underlying (mediating)
factor impacting game performance continuously. However, such an underlying mediating
impact of cognitive workload was not visible.
Our results indicate that considering the emergence and regulation of both the dynamic
process and stable characteristic with respect to affective processes is important when designing serious games, for individuals as well as for groups. As explanation for these results, with respect to characteristics, it appears that, by dealing with emotions before they
arise (i.e., employing a reappraisal as an antecedent-focused emotion regulation strategy;
(Gross and John, 2003), players are better able to focus on the game and on performance,
which suggests that helping players to engage in reappraisal rather than suppression would
be positive in terms of performance. Put differently, reappraisers and suppressors may have
different game design requirements, to enhance their experience and game performance.
Considering that it is not always feasible to train players in emotion regulation prior to
game play, another option is to accommodate these different requirements by implementing adaptive games. It hence appears promising to further examine this relationship by
means of neurophysiological evidence.
Need for cognition, as a characteristic, was more prominent on the group level, indicating that a group need for cognition index needs to be understood and evaluated as part
of game design, in order to foster performance. In an organizational context, groups with
high need for cognition, are expected to perform better in competitive than in cooperative mode, and hence, in this case, the game context would need to be chosen, based on
the group characteristic. This would not only improve performance, but also address specific cognitive needs of individuals, in designing organization systems for collaboration,
improving experience, and encouraging continuous usage.
Turning to dynamic processes, emotion was shown to mediate the influence of mode
on performance, whereas individual cognitive workload was not significantly correlated
with performance in either of the game playing modes. This result implies that experiential players are likely to perform better than players employing the slow and deliberative
processes inducing cognitive workload. Our results imply that, although players might
prefer games that induce high workload and cognitive challenges, such games might not
necessarily be conducive to high performance. On the other hand, games which trigger
emotional processes and create immersive experiences might be more effective in reaching
a particular goal (whether it is in a serious game context or for an organizational purpose).
Hence, in order to ensure continuous usage and meet the purpose of serious games, emo-

137

Chapter 5 Factors for performance differences in interactive serious games
tional and experiential needs of users are a primary factor. Finally, in the case of cognitive
workload, the related stable characteristic of need for cognition was necessary to factor
in, to understand the (negative) direction of impact of cognitive workload. This provides
support to the CAPS framework, that it is quintessential to consider the impact of stable
characteristics and dynamic internal processes together.
With regard to the comparison of influencing factors on individual and group performance, our results show that characteristics which were not significantly impacting individual performance were significant at the group level. Theoretically, this could be explained due to the fact that, personalities and processes of people often tend to have a
compounding (or multiplying) impact, if positively correlated, and increase group performance. To this end, we investigated whether the aggregating method (of sum, product,
ratio, or differences in personality traits) mattered, and whether each characteristic would
need to be treated differently, in order to study the overall impact on behavior. Appendix
D (Table D.3) contains the summary of these results. It can be observed, that in the case of
cooperative mode, taking the difference between two attributes explained the group payoff
best (in terms of model fit). In the case of competitive mode, however, taking the average
of the individual scores of characteristics was most predictive of group payoff. Thus, the
social presence of another individual is a powerful influence on the extent to which characteristics play a role, and the mode of interaction might determine how characteristics
need to be aggregated. This particular result is noteworthy, and requires further research,
since it highlights the importance of incorporating personality factors, based on the social
context of a game, or even an organizational task, for instance.

5.6 Limitations and Future Work
This study is subject to limitations that need to be investigated in future work. First, to
bring out the difference between stable characteristics and dynamic processes, in the case
of characteristics, we performed a context-independent way of measuring these characteristics, whereas dynamic processes were measured in a context-dependent way (i.e., their
emotions and cognitive workload in each of these modes). How continuously, and to what
extent these characteristics are influenced, is a question that has not been regarded in this
study, and needs to be regarded in future work, such as by using pre- and post- questionnaires. Second, we have only considered male-male and female-female interactions in our
analysis, hence assuming homogeneity. It is very possible that male-female interactions

138

5.7 Conclusion
would provide additional interesting insights on gender differences, and how these vary
based on the gender composition of a group. Third, we intentionally used a context-free
symbol recognition task in the experiment to avoid introducing confounding factors. Further research is required to examine how the effects in our study translate into specific
application contexts (e.g., product search, image tagging), due to additional interactions
between context of the application domain - for instance, (emotional) product or brand
involvement - and the various factors investigated in our study. Fourth, group formation
and group processes are very complex and highly dynamic; hence results from any group
experiment need to be extrapolated very carefully to a real-world setting, e.g. a business
context. To this end, different aggregation methods (such as taking the mean, product,
sum or ratio of characteristics), will have to be considered carefully, while drawing conclusions about group performance. Finally, other aspects of game design will also have
to be considered in future work - such as how humans perform with computers, and how
the above factors are changed when interacting with computer agents (Teubner et al.,
2015).

5.7 Conclusion
In this paper, we contribute to understanding which factors affect performance differences in a specific cooperative and competitive serious game, on the basis of contextual,
personality-based and group formation attributes. Performance in games has shown to be
reflective of performance in other contexts as well - for instance, games have been used
to foster organizational change and development (Ruohomäki, 2003; McGonigal, 2011),
and to nurture concepts of collaboration or a desirable level of competition. Performance
differences in cooperative and competitive serious games have shown to depend on individual as well as group characteristics, hence these factors need to be considered to design
user centric games and to improve performance in a serious games context.
Turning back to the question of cooperative and competitive decision processes posed in
the beginning of this chapter, it appears quite strongly from the results of this study that cooperation is a context in which people perform better, in comparision to competition. The
reasons thereof could be explained partially on the basis of personalities, gender, emotions
and cognitive processes. Most importantly, the social setting was shown to determine, to
which extent the personal attributes played a role, as well as the role of the internal processes in determining game performance. Thus, an undertstanding of this nature, of the

139

Chapter 5 Factors for performance differences in interactive serious games
influence of the external environment on internal processes, is only essential to better understand aspects such as willingness to perform, or cooperate, or to even quantify behavior.
Designing systems which takes these into account, is hence a direct corollary, as a means to
improving performance, and to also identifying proactively, the best way to group people
for a common purpose, and potentially, to create better performing ecosystems, by means
of identifying better-performing and better-fitting groups.

Conclusions and future research

“

The ideal of behaviorism is to eliminate coercion:

to apply controls by changing the environment in such
a way as to reinforce the kind of behavior that benefits
everyone.”
B.F. SKINNER (AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST, 1904-1990)

6.1 Summary of Results and General Discussion
Studying decision processes from the point of how the decision environment impacts internal processes, enables the design of so-called human-centric systems, capable of understanding behavior as well as specific behavioral goals. As stated in the epigraph, understanding behavior would pave the way to designing systems for a specific behavioral goal,
and one that maximizes common goals that benefits everyone, such as social welfare. In
a similar spirit, Fogg (1998) coined the concept of persuasive technologies - technologies
capable of motivating people towards a specific behavior, and triggering change in a specific manner. In the context of electronic markets, Weinhardt et al. (2003) write that when
designing electronic markets, it is essential to consider influences that arise from technical
fundamentals, as well as potential user requirements, business constraints, and economic
objectives. Each of these influences has a profound impact on the outcome and, as a consequence, on the usability and the acceptance of the market (Weinhardt et al., 2003). This

141

Chapter 6 Conclusions and future research
thesis contributes to engineering market systems by focusing on behavioral aspects during
design, implementation, and evaluation. Specifically, this work attempts to quantify, to
what extent external and internal influences impact economic decision-making; and applies these results to creating human-centric decision environments. In addition, we also
define the need for, implement, and evaluate a platform to achieve behavioral studies of
the afore-mentioned nature.
Three studies were undertaken, to examine the influences of the decision environment
on behavior, and to study performance and deviations from expected behavior in each of
these environments. In order to achieve this, a NeuroIS approach was adopted, the method
which facilitates the integration of neuroscientific theories into the design of IT artefacts.
We examined two internal processes using a NeuroIS approach - namely, emotional arousal
and cognitive workload. Three types of external influences were examined - namely, events
(such as gains and losses), known parameters (such as time available, and whether the
individual is in a group or individual context), and unknown parameters (such as value
uncertainty, and probability of occurrence of an event). In the process of implementing
the above studies, we identified the lack of a suitable experimental platform that facilitates both behavioral and NeuroIS aspects. Therefore, our first challenge was to collect
and describe the requirements for, and develop a platform to conduct behavioral studies
empirically in a controlled environment. To this end, the design objective in this thesis
was stated as follows:
• DO: A freely available and extensible experimental platform that facilitates (i)
experiments of individuals and groups, (ii) physiological measurements and
time synchronization, and (iii) real-time integration of physiological data
In order to identify and provide a technical solution that meets emerging requirements
for conducting NeuroIS research, the platform Brownie was implemented as part of this
thesis. Brownie stands for behavioral Research of grOups using Web and NeuroIS Experiments, and is a Java-based platform that may primarily be used to implement the interface
elements, to model the decision environment being studied. Brownie also enables integration of NeuroIS specific measures, such as heart rate (HR), skin conductance response
(SCR), Electroencephalography (EEG), and eye-tracking into one platform. Importantly,
Brownie enables the incorporation of the upcoming feature of real-time physiological indicators such as live-biofeedback. These indicators may be integrated in studies to understand the impact of specific neurophysiological measures on decision behavior. With
this platform, we help reduce both the effort and technical knowledge required to conduct

142

6.1 Summary of Results and General Discussion
NeuroIS research, to a better manageable level. We also provide a high level of flexibility
with regards to individual experimenters’ needs, such as extensibility to emerging NeuroIS
methodologies and scalability across various devices. Brownie contributes to research in
studying decision making processes in the lab, as well as in designing and implementing
experiments to study the interrelationships between decision environment and decision
behavior.
We next addressed the research questions of this thesis, concerning the impact of decision environment on internal processes, and consequently on behavior. As the first research
question, we aimed to understand expected value (EV) maximizing behavior in a trading
context. We investigated whether adopting different emotion regulation strategies is accompanied by different levels of integral arousal, and has a significant role in explaining
deviations from behavior as defined by expected-value maximization, particularly when
experiencing gains and losses. Our first research question was stated as follows:
• RQ1: In an individual context, do emotion-regulation strategies moderate the
role of integral arousal on EV-maximizing behavior, particularly in dealing with
the external influences of gains and losses?
To this end, a single-decision trading experiment was implemented, where participants
were subjected to a repeated single-decision trading experiment, along with questionnaires and physiological measures (HR and SCR). Participants’ EV-maximizing behavior
was recorded, by means of decisions to hold or keep the owned stock, after experiencing
gains and losses.
The results showed that participants who predominantly employed the emotion regulation strategy of reappraisal ("reappraisers") exhibited lower integral arousal (measured
in HR and SCR) than those who had a lower reappraisal tendency. On the other hand,
those who employed suppression ("suppressors") had a higher integral arousal than those
who suppressed emotions lesser. Reappraisers also made better decisions (in terms of
EV maximizing) after experiencing losses than gains, whereas suppressors did not. Our
study thus supports the notion that while reappraisal of negative emotions is beneficial
for decision-making processes, suppression is not necessarily advantageous. In the future,
it could hence be affirmed, if inducing emotion regulation strategies (of reappraisal) in
decision-makers (such as traders and private investors) is associated with better decisionmaking performance. Such reappraisal-inducing techniques, might however need to be
validated with additional psychophysiological measures such as illustrated by Astor et al.
(2013a).

143

Chapter 6 Conclusions and future research
Turning to the second research question addressed in this thesis, we next attempted to
quantify the experienced cognitive workload and emotional arousal, and examine how the
auction environment moderates the impact of these internal processes on bidding behavior.
To this end, we addressed the following research question:
• RQ2: How do the external influences of specific auction elements (auction dynamics, value uncertainty) moderate the relation between internal processes
(emotional arousal, cognitive workload) and bidding behavior?
An auction experiment involving two auction formats (FPSB and Dutch auction), and
utilizing psychophysiological measures of EEG and HR, was designed to investigate the
above question. In the analysis, we attempted to understand, how the processes of cognitive workload and emotional arousal, impacted bidding behavior, based on deviations from
a benchmark model (of RNNE strategy). Our results showed that arousal experienced due
to Dutch auctions was significantly correlated with more deviations from RNNE bidding,
whereas cognitive workload did not have a similar influence on bidding behavior. Hence,
our results suggest that the presence of auction dynamics moderates only the impact of
emotional arousal, to lead to more deviations from RNNE. Turning to value uncertainty,
high value uncertainty impacted the effect of cognitive workload, leading to worse bidding behavior. In other words, under high value uncertainty, participants deviate more
from RNNE strategy due to cognitive workload than emotional arousal. Choosing the right
auction setting (such as the auction format, and the value uncertainty level) is therefore
crucial to how the two processes of arousal and cognitive workload determine participants’
bidding behavior. In addition, these pave way for understanding behavior in a specific decision environment, and designing systems that take the impact on internal processes into
account, and motivate people towards a specific goal (Heilman et al., 2010; Eriksson and
Sharma, 2003) - in this case, minimizing deviations from RNNE bidding strategy.
Turning to our third research question, we examined how the external factors (of which
setting a person is in, whether cooperative or competitive), impacts performance in a given
context. Whether one is able to perform well in a cooperative or competitive context, has
often shown to be determined by the personality characteristics of a person, as well as the
dynamic internal processes, namely, the emotional arousal and cognitive workload. We
specifically explored the following:
• RQ3: In a group context, how do external influences (cooperative and competitive game playing mode), and personality-related factors (characteristics and
internal processes) impact individual and group game performance?

144

6.2 Outlook and Future Research
We examined the personality-related factors in two social settings (cooperative and
competitive). In a controlled laboratory experiment, participants played a pattern recognition game repeatedly, along with physiological measures (of EEG, HR and SCR) to measure internal processes. Our results showed that participants performed worse in competitive mode in comparison to cooperative mode, and male participants performed better
than females, where performance was measured in terms of hits, misses and unclicked
attempts in the game. Secondly, participants with a high reappraiser score performed significantly better in both cooperative and competitive modes, but other considered characteristics (namely, suppressor score, need for cognition) did not significantly impact individual performance. Emotions mediated the influence of game environment on performance,
whereas cognitive workload did not have a similar impact. The results from a game performance context, may be transferred to organizational contexts and collaborative systems,
in order to engage people in a particular task, for extended periods of time, or in retaining
the attention of users and encouraging performance during the task. In addition, social
settings could be appropriately chosen in a personality-specific manner, when they have to
be grouped, in order to improve performance. Finally, experiential factors in a game could
be focussed upon more, since these lead to improvements in game performance more readily than cognitive processes, specifically applicable to in effort tasks (Paolacci et al., 2010;
Chandler and Kapelner, 2013).

6.2 Outlook and Future Research
We believe that our studies have contributed to a better understanding of the interplay between external and internal influences on decision behavior, taking both the cognitive and
affective aspects into consideration. Being aware of both external and internal influences
that shape human behavior and manifest as an action is proving to be increasingly valuable
in the design of decision support systems. Decision support systems that analyze a broad
range of information and enable managers to make business decisions more easily, are
proliferating the business world (Chen et al., 2012). These tools and methods are turning
to be vital to understand and meet customer ends to an unparalleled degree. Such systems aim to continuously monitor and support decisions, especially in dealing with market
situations and business factors, which are beyond the control of the decision-maker.
Nevertheless, our research is subject to some limitations that need to be addressed in
future research. The first one of these is that, in all the studies in this work, inferences

145

Chapter 6 Conclusions and future research
have been drawn, on the basis of behavior in a laboratory setting. These results would
hence have to be validated in external settings, by means of field experiments, to understand behavioral differences in environments without as much control as was established
in the lab. Second, decision environments (of trading, auctions, and gaming) were predesigned environment, with a rather "simplistic" design, to achieve control of participants’
decision environment, and to study influences on behavior. Transferring these results to a
system design context, and examining whether the specific design changes in the decision
environment, indeed correspond to the behavioral changes mentioned in these studies, remains to be addressed. Taking this a step further, such design changes could be achieved
in real-time as well, as adaptive systems, which adapt according to users’ current internal
state. Third, subjects in these studies were students, and it remains to be validated, how
the proposed models function across demographics, age groups, and cultures, that might
further explain differences in decision behavior in further depth. Finally, in all the studies,
further explanations of decision behavior arise when personality factors are taken into account. While we make a beginning in this direction by means of our experiments, several
intricate issues remain to be addressed, in dealing with cognitive-affective aspects, along
with personalities and stable characteristics.
Turning to future research, from a consumer perspective, the necessity to analyze and
incorporate emotional aspects in individual decision-making, is being increasingly highlighted in recent literature (Fenton-O’Creevy et al., 2011; Fernández et al., 2010). On the
one hand, interface design of financial decision makers could gain from the above NeuroIS studies, to improve user satisifaction as well as to enrich user experience (Riedl et al.,
2014). On the other hand, individual decision support might be trained and achieved
with NeuroIS methods, such as live biofeedback (Astor et al., 2013a), or by designing
neuro-adaptive systems (Parsons and Reinebold, 2012). For instance, in a trading context,
decision-makers may be shown live updates of their current excitement level using HR information, to help them be aware of their emotional states, and to make better decisions,
in addition to taking the business factors, into account.
From a business provider perspective, the growing importance of business analytics, and
their subfields, such as business intelligence have been subject to research for achieving
competitive advantages, both from a technical and management perspective (Davenport
and Harris, 2007). These tools and methods are turning to be vital to understand and
meet customer ends to an unparalleled degree, and hence staying competitive as a business provider. In addition to enhancing consumer experience, we propose that NeuroIS
methods could be integrated to the business and analytical world, in three specific ways.

146

6.3 Concluding Note
We identify three possible ways of integrating the potential of NeuroIS methods: First,
NeuroIS data could be used to enhance analytics of individual and group data from customers and employees. Second, NeuroIS data could provide live biofeedback to Business
analytic systems in order to build user-adaptive business intelligence (BI) and business
analysis and optimization (BAO) systems, wherein the user of the BI system is the decision
maker as well. Third, experimental setups should be implemented in order to understand
the user interaction of BI and BAO systems and NeuroIS data.
In the design of such systems, careful experimentation is an utmost prerequisite, in
order to understand the impact of neuro- and bio- information on decision-making processes. To this end, we propose the use of the experimental platform Brownie, in order
to conduct behavioral research of groups, on both web and NeuroIS interface designs.
By collecting and analysing physiological data of participants in several decision contexts,
it would be feasible to understand, at which stage of individual decision processes such
neuro adaptive methods are required, and how these vary across individuals. Thus, these
can subsequently be used for enhancing the decision support systems, and to foster better
and emotionally aware decision-making.

6.3 Concluding Note
In this thesis, we detailed three studies to examine how the external environment impacts
the role of internal influences on decision behavior. First, we saw that dealing with events
of financial gains and losses, is better achieved by people who reappraise (cognitively alter
the imapct of emotions, before they occur) their emotions. Second, we saw that different
aspects of the environment, impacts different internal processes. Specifically, in an auction
environment, auction dynamics altered the influence of emotional arousal, whereas value
uncertainty altered the influence of cognitive workload, on decision behavior. Finally, in
a game environment, we saw that, emotions mediated the influence of game mode (cooperation or competition), whereas, cognitive workload did not have a similar mediating
effect. Thus, the emotional and experiential aspects of a game environment determined
performance more strongly than the cognitive workload.
In addition, we developed and provided a Java-based platform Brownie, to systematically investigate questions of this nature: which external factors influence which internal
processes, and how these in turn impact decision behavior, using a NeuroIS approach. We

147

Chapter 6 Conclusions and future research
hope that the platform serves as a tool to address several behavioral questions, that may
be better clarified with an understanding of the human self, using psychophysiological and
NeuroIS methods.

Arousal-Workload additional findings

Detailed Procedure for emotional arousal from Measured Heart Rates
To operationalize emotional arousal (EA), heart rates of all participants were measured before
the experiment (baseline heart rate) and also before each bid. In order to make heart rates
comparable across participants, we normalized the heart rates prior to the bid by dividing each
value by a participant’s baseline heart rate. For each participant and auction, this yields 20
normalized heart rate values, in the time interval of 3 to 1 seconds directly prior to the bid (in slots
of .1 second each). EA of a bid was calculated by reducing the 20 normalized heart rate values
to a single factor using Principal Component Analysis with promax rotation (Shivappa et al., 2010).
The last second before bid submission (E2) is not included in the computation of the factor, since
this period typically constitutes the preparation of the imminent bidding action (Teubner et al.,
2015). The PCA yields a standardized variable with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 for each
combination of participant and auction, as shown in Table 1. The actual statistics of EA do not
exactly match 0 and 1, generated by the PCA process. The mean value is –.022, standard
deviation is .98. The small aberration stems from the fact that, while combining the dataset of
heart rate measures with EEG, some observations had to be dropped due to EEG measurement
errors.

Figure C.1: Normalized heart rates at bid submission (t=0)
Figure C.1 shows the normalized heart rates for the 4 treatments relative to bid submission (E2).
The increase in heart rate prior to bidding is observed to be higher for high auction dynamics
(Dutch auctions) than low auction dynamics (FPSB auctions), whereas the differences for different
levels of value uncertainty are less pronounced.

Detailed Procedure for Computing Cognitive Workload from Measured EEG Activity
We followed the procedure of Pope et al. (1995). The EEG data was sampled at 500 Hz with a
bandpass filter from 1 Hz to 40 Hz. The computation of cognitive workload index was executed in
two steps: (1) Computation of independent components and (2) Computation of spectral powers
in the above frequency bands. Independent components were computed using fast Independent
Component Analysis (fastICA) algorithm available in the EEGLab toolbox for 14 frontal channels
for each subject, and a Matlab script was developed to automate the process across all
participants. Correspondingly, 14 independent components resulted, which were artefact cleaned
for each subject by eyeball inspection, to remove components with possible eye, muscle
movements or electrical interference. Next, power spectra were calculated for 2 second windows
before each event, across each treatment type for 6 events of interest during the auction as shown
in Figure 3. The EEG cognitive workload index mirrors the theoretical definition of cognitive
workload, taking into account the absolute and relative power spectra from 1 to 30 Hz of EEG
channel. The spectral powers of each of the frequency bands (Beta, Alpha, and Theta) are
calculated on the independent components obtained from 14 frontal channels, and then cognitive
workload is computed by the formula (Beta / (Alpha + Theta)) spectral power (Pope et al., 1995).

Figure C.2: 1) Perceived cognitive workload (NASA-TLX), 2) Cognitive workload index
(EEG)
Figure C.2 shows that both perceived and measured cognitive workload indices were higher for
high than for low value uncertainty auctions. The dimension of physical demand has been omitted
from the NASA TLX, since it is not relevant for the sedentary auction task. PCW was higher for
Dutch than for FPSB auction, CW was higher for FPSB than Dutch auctions. However, the
difference in means is only marginal, and not significant.

Figure D.1 depicts the heatmap of experienced workload, whenever the target pattern was
in position n, where n is from 1 to 20 possible positions. It can be seen, that there were not
major differences in the experienced workload due to the position of the pattern. This was
true, for both cooperative and competitive modes, and for all performance measures. Participants experienced the highest workload in position 2, on the top row, second column.
Thus, it is likely that these patterns were harder to find, due to their position. However,
this was not significantly predicting performance, when tested with a regression as well.

FIGURE D.1: Heatmap depicting experienced workload, in each of the positions 1-20
Figure D.2 depicts the workload for each of the 42 rounds. As can be observed, the
workload tends to remain predominantly stable, with a tendency for lower workload towards the end of the game, only in the case of individual mode. Hence, it may be concluded that, in the context of game play, especially in cooperative and competitive modes,
workload tends to remain relatively stable. In other words, participants were required to
expend continuous effort in scoring well across the experiment.
