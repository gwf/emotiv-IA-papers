Abstract
Correlation analysis allows detecting the degree of relatedness between two variables. Even when correlation does not mean
necessarily causation, in a time series, it indicates the degree of synchrony of two comparing variables and in many aspects
renders similar information compared with cross-coherence analysis of the electroencephalographic signal. In this work we
explore rather simple statistical features to mine into deeper underlying aspects of the functional organization of the brain
during performing an intelligence test. We studied time length duration taken to solve a series of questions ordered with
increasing difficulty and the correlation values reached by tine series data synchronization between the 14 EEG channels
placed in the subject’s scalp, during the mental task. The intelligence test consisted in an abbreviated (15 questions) version
of the Raven Matrices test. Results coming from the correlation analysis showed relevant information about functional
organization strategies of the brain solving a cognitive problem, as well as good discrimination for inter-individual
differences in the way inter-channel correlation values distribute differently for each subject around central values of R.

1. Introduction
When we do a mental task we would expect, or at least believe, that our brain must work in such a way that
uses its better resources to find the required answer. During lifetime we know that not all the people have the
same way of thinking or face problem solving tasks, while inter-individual differences in performance are tried
to measure over a range scale in which we assign an ordinal scale of valuation of the success in solving the task.
Objective measurements of individual differences are scarce or are designed in the form of a test, or a set of
tests, that renders a belonging to a specific category, according to a value, or index, that is associated with the
test performance.

To not only be informed by the rendered results, but to evaluate the test in terms of a process, we need to
evaluate the ongoing procedure of being solving the test. This obligates to setup a mid- or long term monitoring
device that capture relevant data to estimate indicators of the quality and efficiency of the process executed.
By means of an EEG capture device it is possible to record electrical brain activity and use the time series
fluctuation of the voltage to estimate indicative trends and/or regularities of the ongoing process happening in
the brain. Ideally, we will count with an analytic tool to quantitatively measure and discriminate individual
differences, as we explore in this paper, studying the brain activity of subjects while performing a mental task
with increasing level of complexity.
According to a general model we would expect that the brain, posed in front of a cognitive challenge, must
reveal, in some way or another, a set of characteristics emerging from the ongoing underlying neural process,
whose tendencies or regularities, can be illuminated (or indicated) by direct or proxy features illustrated by the
study of EEG phenomenology.
In this work we are going to explore the phenomenology of two of these proxy features which are: i) the
time duration of solving questions, and ii) the degree of neural activity correlation between a set of pairs of
electrodes placed on the scalp of a subject, during executing an intelligence test which has been built in a
progressive increase of difficulty.

2. Method
2.1. Raven’s (abbreviated version) progressive matrices test.
Raven’s Progressive Matrices test [1] is a non-verbal test that consists of a number of problems in which the
subject selects, from a set of alternatives, missing pieces of a chart with the aim to complete a drawing logical
series. The task consists in compare forms and figures reasoning by analogy. The test used in this experiment
corresponds to a reduced version (15 questions) of the original Raven test. Sequential figures are presented in a
computer screen and the response process is recorded in real time, while an electroencephalogram (EEG) is
simultaneously recorded from 14 electrodes settled on the subject’ scalp.
2.2. EEG recording and analysis.
EEG recording consisted of two groups of subjects (N1=12 and N2=15) which were recorded in basal
(resting conditions) EEG with open and closed eyes, prior to the test, and a further EEG recording captured
during the whole resolution of the abbreviated version of the Raven test. We used the non-invasive brain
computer device Emotiv EPOC® [2] to record 14 channels from head locations according to the standard 10/20
system, at 128 Hz sample rate. After subtracting baseline and eliminating common signal artifacts with the
assistance of EEGLAB and ADJUST [3] toolboxes running under Matlab, we obtained clean signals for the
whole frequency record (1-64 Hz) and five standard EEG bands: delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma. These
signals reflect the ongoing functional dynamics of each subject's brain operation in two conditions of quiet
resting awake (eyes open and closed), and during the execution of the test. For each question solved,
correlation matrices were calculated for all cross-pair electrodes numbered from 1 to 14, to obtain 91 values of
Spearman correlations (R) between pairs of 14 scalp location according to the diagram illustrated in Fig.1.
We were interested in general comparison among intra-left and intra-right hemispheric correlations
compared with inter-hemispheric correlations, in whole frequency (1-64 Hz) and specific EEG bands.
We plot average values of R for each question and analyze the change of this value during the execution
transit from question 1 to 15. According with the general hypothesis that the brain tends to loose
synchronization in the transit to more complex mental processing, we expect a concomitant R change
while increasing question number, indicating a change of organization resources in the brain while
dealing progressively with more complex cognitive challenges. We also explored how good proxy
indicator of difficulty is the time taken to solve each question. To visualize this we plot time duration

for each question in all the individuals to see if any grouping pattern appears and to see if time alone is
a good indicator of difficulty level.

3. Results
3.1. Time duration taken to solve questions
Figure 2 shows the variation of time length used to solve each of the 15 questions for the 12 individuals of
de first group N1. It can be seen an interesting oscillatory trend in the length of time consumed to solve the
progression of questions while increasing difficulty. A clear cut occurs around questions 10-11 which also
coincide in average with T50, the half time of the whole solving process.
What is interesting is the almost fully alternating behavior of the time taken to solve the question’s
progression. It is not a regular increase but and oscillatory increasing with alternation of high and low values.

3.2. Correlation analysis.
Figure 3 shows beta (12-30 Hz) and gamma band (30-64 Hz) averaged R values (N2=4) for the resolution
process of 15 Raven matrices ordered with increasing difficulty.
Two significant differences can be observed from the plots. First, gamma values run constantly during all
questions, rendering left correlations with the highest R values (~0.5). While in beta band the higher R values
belong to right hemisphere correlations, with highest R values around (~0.4).
A particular difference happens in beta band which drastically reduces R averages values from question
number 11 reaching the lower values of R (~ 0.3) for inter-hemispheric correlations.
Interestingly, question number 11 marks an arbitrary split of the test in two parts (easy and difficult) taking
into account the total time duration of the test and splitting in the middle. This T 50 coincides in our test coincide
with the question 11 timeframe, indicating that subjects take the same time to cover question from 1 to 10, as to
cover questions from 11 to 15. This change is also clearly seeing in almost all the records showed in Figure 1
where time length values rise by the end of the test.
Table 1 shows average and standard deviation for R values calculated from inter-hemispheric (L-R), left, right
and whole brain R values of Spearman correlations.

3.3. Correlation analysis and inter-individual differences.
To evaluate the usefulness of usage correlation data to identify inter-individual differences, we plot the
frequency distribution of the 91 R values obtained from each individual (N 2=12), comparing the first half of the
test (“easy”) with the second part of the test (“difficult”) according our T 50 criteria previously exposed.
Results for whole brain gamma band correlation R values are shown in Figure 4. Individual IDs are written
at the bottom of two graphs, one on top of the other. First half frequency R distributions are plotted in the top
graph to compare with the second part of the test, at the bottom. Vertical line that crosses the distribution
graphs corresponds to R = 0.5.
Individual differences are evident in the way the brain organize correlations around R values and in some
cases strong changes in the organization adjustment occurs between easy and difficult part of the test (see
subject AGR). In other cases, strongly high values of correlation persist during the whole execution of the test
(see subject GLD and RTZ).

comparing first half (“easy”) and second half (“difficult”) part of the test.

Conclusions
In this paper we tested the possibility to use some EEG proxy variables to have an idea about the
organization and dynamical adaptation of brain resources faced to a cognitive task with increasing difficulty.
Our result showed that both, time lengths taken to answer each question, and inter-channel correlation R
values, are good proxy variable predictors of the degree of difficulty of the test and are good informers of some
aspects of the underlying neural process that occurs during an intelligent test execution.
Time lengths taken for answering each question grow progressively through the advance of the test but not
in a straight line, but in an oscillatory manner. This phenomenon is widely observed in almost all the
individuals tested.
R values averages for beta and gamma band showed different behaviors during the execution of the test
indicating a different role in the data processing of the problem. Gamma R values were higher than average
beta values, but only beta values are sensitive to a change in test difficulty as shown in the comparison in figure
2. Hemispheric asymmetry is also observed between beta and gamma for higher and lower values of R.

Inter-individual differences are also easily detectable looking at the way R values distributes around the
center of the frequency distribution. It is observed that different frequency distribution shapes characterize each
individual.
The especial interest of this work was to explore EEG phenomenology in terms of an oscillatory non-linear
system that moves in the limits of predictability and chaos [4], to do this we consider a correlational approach
that allow us to see the process development in time and gives us a general working framework about how the
brain can be organizing processing resources, during a cognitive mental task, in terms of functional
connectivity and inter-channel synchronization [5].
