Abstract. This article describes modern wireless sensor devices and their application in the measurements
of the human physiology. We used our own advanced
ECG Holter device and EEG helmet to record the heart
and brain activity impacted by different environments,
materials, colors or body positions during work. In
this paper, we want to show the interactions between
humans and architecture design, which modify human
work performance and well-being. This paper is a conclusion of the 3 different pilot studies, where different
scopes of human-space interaction were explored. In
the experiments, we aimed mostly at wood materials
and their beneficial effects on the nervous system. The
research in its actual state is primarily focused on optimizing the methods of the ECG data analysis from our
Holter device and the EEG data from helmet. Based
on these data, we will improve the methodology of the
experiments for the next enhanced research with aspiration to automate data analysis.

Introduction

Wireless devices used to monitor the human physiological parameters are very important for easy recording
of individuals in many environments, where is not possible usage of wired laboratory devices. We realized
various experiments, where the physiological parameters of the humans were explored.

The shape and choice of materials and colors influence human health, activity, psychic state, work efficiency and human well-being [1] and [2]. In general,
it is possible to declare that the more natural materials in their authentic form and more nature-evoking
solutions are present in the immediate surrounding environment of a human being during his long-term daily
assets. The explanation comes from evolutionary biology and psychology. Natural materials are beneficial to
the nervous system, which responds to something well
known to him, which he does not need to constantly
"scan". A nervous system, that is directly linked to our

ronment and environment for well-being. Its positive
properties for the comfort and health of the human,
for the internal environment and its microclimates can
be formulated as follows. It aggravates and softens the
overall atmosphere of the space supporting coziness. It
is aesthetically attractive - its shape and surface properties - the color of the wood is warm to earthy, its
color, texture, structure, invoice can also soften and
"warm" otherwise cold lighting in space. It has excellent haptic properties - contact comfort, especially
by softwoods. Wood-based materials are well formable
and adaptable to the shape of the human body. Thanks
to the comfort features, they allow good control over
the body positions and the possibilities of their variation. They also have antibacterial properties, especially pine, larch and oak. The wood regulates air
humidity and emissions. It is a part of our culture,
collective unconscious, and it is in genetic memory.
However, in order to have an ecological meaning, it
is necessary to apply natural materials from renewable
raw materials from sustainable forestry or agriculture.
Most of these strengths of wood are effective when the
wood is free from any surface treatment. Application
of the wood significantly supports regenerative effect of
built- environment for the human nervous system and
it can contribute to recovery in the health care facilities. Research in this area provides an evidence base of
positive health impacts of wood used in the built environment [3]. However, the measurement of perception of aesthetical quality of materials is challenging
[4]. Several methods for verification of user preferences
might be implemented including surveys and hedonistic/preferences tests. They might provide quantitative
and/or qualitative feedback. Selection of materials, as
well as target groups of respondents, should be carefully planned in order to obtain reliable results. Assessment can be performed by using only visual stimuli or
it can include other senses (in both cases, use of real or
virtual samples can be implemented). Using the real
samples and employing more senses than only vision
(hearing, taste, smell and/or touch) during the assessment is a superior approach. Human perception tests
might be supported by the measuring of physiological
responses in order to provide a complete picture of human emotions [5].
Till now, we have prepared series of many experiments for optimization of the ECG Holter [6] and [7].
Below, we describe three already finalized experiments.
In the 1st experiment, we monitored physiological parameters of the humans in various body positions, in
the area with limits in space and diminished move
which influence work efficiency and creativity during
routine work. There was an aim to show the direct
impact in different body postures by work, to show
that not only standard right angle sitting, but also active sitting, perching, standing and relaxed posture are
suitable for work, being effective or creative by working

task. Thus, interior elements allowing these alternative postures can be included in the standard working
environment and they can be a part of working culture. The 2nd experiment aimed to response of the
humans to the different environmental settings. We developed an application to simulate various living spaces
by virtual reality and measured response of the neural system. The application BCDapp was developed in
2014–2015 with the aim to found out the instrument to
simulate the different environmental settings, namely
by choice of materials and their surfaces and to see the
impact of human well-being. The app also has its own
evaluation mechanism that tells respondents the impact of their choice. In our continuing experiment, we
also measured the physiological parameters of volunteers interacting with different materials - oak wood,
chipboard and white laminate. Individuals were sitting
in front of the selected material with closed eyes, then
they touch it and finally, they were looking on these
materials.

Material and Methods

In all experiments, we specifically measured heart rate
and respiration activity using our own designed ECG
Holter and brain activity by commercial EEG helmet
Emotiv EPOC. All devices used for these experiments
are wireless, therefore, they do not physically limit our
volunteers. The experiments were done in BCD laboratory at Faculty of Architecture, STU.

Designed Holter monitor (Fig. 1, Fig. 2 and Tab. 1)
uses the latest advances available in the microelectronics today. The device was primarily designed for
24-hour daily monitoring of ECG and it can be useful in many clinical applications including diagnosis
of arrhythmias, ischemia, or heart failure. The core
of the Holter device are analog font-end Texas Instruments ADS1292R and microcontroller ATxmega
128A3. The ADS1292R is 2-channel, 24-bit, ∆ − Σ
AD converter with a built-in programmable gain amplifier, internal reference, and an on-board oscillator.

The ADS1292R incorporates all features commonly required in portable, low-power medical electrocardiogram with sports and fitness applications. Power consumption of one channel is only 335 µW. Used version
also includes impedance measurement function where
32/64 kHz modulating square wave signal is driving
the human body impedance trough known impedances.
After demodulation and low pass (2–4 Hz) filtering,
we can obtain the respiration. The ATxmega 128A3
is low power, high-performance 16-bit µcontroller featuring 128 KB flash program memory, 8 KB SRAM,
2048 Byte EEPROM, and up to 32 MIPS throughput at 32 MHz. The device is capable of achieving extremely low power consumption, which is required by both portable electronics and other batterypowered applications. The ECG Holter is extended by
the gyroscope STMicroelectronics L3GD20, accelerometer with magnetometer STMicroelectronics LSM303D
and barometer with temperature sensor Bosh BMP180.
Total power consumption of the device is 3 mA (on
250 SPS). By using standard 120 mAh Li-Pol cell,
system allows operating time over 40 hours. Ideal
working time (25 hours) can be achieved on 500 SPS.
Thanks to microcontroller implemented HRV (Heart
Rate Variability) detection algorithms, ECG Holter
can be switched in HRV mode (only HRV peaks are detected) for extended operation time of few days. Data
are stored in CSV format to built-in 4 GB SD card,
with possibility of conversion to +EDF format. The
Holter is fixed to the human body using pre-gelled disposable Ag/AgCl electrodes. Optical signalization and
trigger button are installed on the top of the Holter.
Acoustic signalization and micro USB connector for
recharging, data transfer and parameter set are located
on the reverse side. Holter is equipped with real-time
clock for time-log management. The real-time is after connecting of Holter to PC automatically set and
corrected. Thanks to all these features, following the
latest trends, we can use our device in wide range of
experiments and monitoring in several scientific areas.
In these experiments, the ECG Holter measures heart
and respiration signals at sampling rate 500 Hz and
acceleration on 100 SPS.

for medical use, but also for measuring of the emotions, thoughts, behavior or feelings. From psychology
studies, we know that HRV is associated with many
factors, for example an increase in HRV is related to
increased self-control abilities, greater social skills, and
better abilities to cope with stress. In our HRV analysis, we used frequency-domain methods, data related
to the amount of Low Frequency - LF (0.04–0.15 Hz),
which represents a measurement of sympathetic nervous system activity. Sympathetic activity affects the
body performance and is active in an attack, escape behavior or exceptional straining. Measurements of High
Frequency - HF (0.15–0.4 Hz) correlate to parasympathetic activity which can be an expression of regeneration and the formation of body reserves. It takes care
of relax and the rest. In addition, a ratio of LF and
HF (LF/HF) can determine the information regarding
the amount of sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous
system activity. Low values represent relax, rest and
energy saving, vice versa, high values mean increased
performance and body strain [9], [10] and [11]. Very
common visualization of HRV is a Poincare plot. The
Poincare plot shows how well each RR interval predicts the next. A greater spread of values means an
increased HRV, conversely, the closer bunching of the
values together means less HRV. The typical Poincare
scatter plots of the healthy controls exhibit a greater
dispersion. There is significant correlation between LF
and SD2, HF and SD1, and LF/HF and SD2/SD.

From these signals, we calculated Heart Rate (HR),
Respiration Rate (RR), Respiration Volume (RV) and
we did detailed HRV analysis [8] and [9]. The accelerometer was used only as a supplement to simplify
evaluation and artifact suppression. The HR is reflecting activity of the autonomic nervous system, and the
changes of this activity provide a suitable indicator
of the human state and mood. HRV is often a first
glance, where we can recognize good health - if HRV
is higher, heart beats are more variable and person
is readier for action, on the other hand, a low HRV
is associated with increased arousal or ill health (it is
a significant predictor of mortality from several disNext device used for measuring of the physiological

The EEG analysis includes the evaluation of the alpha waves EEG (α) (8–12 Hz), appearing during relaxation and when person has closed eyes, beta waves
EEG (β) (12–30 Hz), which relate with raised concentration and thinking [11], [12], [13] and [14]. We also
aimed at SensoriMotor Rhythm EEG (SMR), which
is closer part of beta waves (12–15 Hz) interpreted as
so-called „relaxed attention“. That means executive efficiency when people are concentrated and attentive
without any extra effort for a longer time period [15]
and [16]. The environmental setting supporting this
state should be very suitable for a standard executive
working task. The EEG (α) was measured in frontal
cortex, responsible for executive functions, planning,
motivation, organization and solving problems, in the
temporal lobe, responsible for language understanding,
behavior and memory and parietal lobe, which is specialized for processing of body information. The EEG
(β) was evaluated in occipital lobe responsible for vision and imagination and again in parietal lobe. The
EEG (SMR) was sensed only in central area, which is
responsible for sensing and feeling.
All obtained data were first evaluated in LabChart
program (ADInstruments). Additional statistical analysis was done in Microsoft Excel, Origin Lab and
GraphPad.

and light colors and with natural materials-textiles, the
2nd room was in brownish colors with wooden materials and the 3rd room, the most stimulating, in strong
colors and with artificial imitation wood and synthetic

aim of this pilot test was to verify the methodology of
the evaluation system of the BCDapp - if our evaluation

responses of the control sample of respondents. We
measured EEG (SMR) and monitored HR, RR, LF/HF

interacting with different materials - oak wood, chipboard and white laminate as reference material. The
individuals were sitting in distance of 1 meter in front
of the selected material (1×2 m boards) with closed
eyes (1 minute), then they were touching this material
(30 seconds),and finally, they were looking on this material (1 minute). All phases were repeated in 5 consecutive environments. The complete test lasted roughly
13 minutes for each person. During the test, physiological activity (HR, RR, RV, LF/HF and complete EEG)

Typical signals measured during the 1stexperiment are
shown in Fig. 5 and detailed overall analysis follows in
Tab. 3. We observed increased physical activity during dynamic sitting by highest LF/HF ratio (+52 %),
in comparison with average values, which showed increased activity of the body, because volunteers were
forced to balance in sitting position. These values are
proper for training and they improve mental condition.
The lowest RV (−27 %) and relative low HR (−3.2 %)
at the same time represent saving of the heart muscle.

(−6.1 %) were at the lowest levels. Misbalanced environment with synthetic materials and strong colors
is for humans’ very stressful, which is documented by
very low SMR waves (−25.8 %) and very high LF/HF
ratio (+47 %), which means that people are distracted.
In this experiment, we also used Poincare plots (Fig. 6)
for HRV analysis. The resultant SD2/SD1 correlates
to LF/HF analysis as was expected, so it is not necessary to evaluate in next experimental setting. We can
say that it is only different representation of LF, HF
and LF/HF results.

the impact of selected material on volunteers or locate
persons to environment without knowledge about materials. Interesting appear experiments with full environment, where all senses are absorbed surrounding;
for example, sense of smell can be important in wood
environment. Our next work is continuing with experiments in the real hospital environment, concretely in
waiting room at National Oncological Institute, which
was designed especially to maximize the benefits of using natural materials. We hypothesize good influence
of wood on patients and its antimicrobial ability maximizes benefits of this design.

Conclusion

The main aim of our experiments is the optimization
and improvement of the measurement and the methodology of the evaluation of physiological parameters acquired by our ECG Holter and EEG Epoc device. It
was confirmed that human physiology is strongly influenced by environment around us. Therefore, appropriate work surrounding designed from natural materials or fabrics with balanced colors can improve performance of the individuals. Increase activity, logic
thinking and creativity, which lead to better work satisfaction is also stimulated by suitable positions. We
presented three experiments where we showed human
physiological parameters influenced by environments
and working positions. It was our first clue to the physiological experiments on humans impacted by environment design. Analysis of this 1st experiment “Impact
of office environment design - body positions” led to
supporting our approaches on measurements of human
well-being and it promoted our upgrade to use EEG
helmet, which we added in 2nd experiment. In this
experiment, we also used BCDapp application in virtual reality with different environmental settings for
recording experimental data. Virtual reality allows
easy changing of the environment parameters, which
influence people without big changes of real surrounding or without disturbance in one room. This approach
is perspective tool for measurement of human responses
to various environmental stimuli. Added the EEG data
analysis helped better understand human physiological status. The brain waves data showed, which part
of the brain is active and what this activity means.
We aimed at the SMR waves, which are suitable indicator of the increased brain activity without stress
and of the well-being of the individuals. All these parameters were measured in the 3rd experiment, where
volunteers interacted with wood, laminate and chipboard. This experiment is pointed to relevance of the
materials around us, in our homes or offices. Natural
materials and fabrics showed positive impact on work
efficiency, creativity and they also have good impact
on stress or depression of the humans. For more accurate results, we require higher number of the volunteers
in our experiments. Also, we want to prolong time of
