Abstract. Recent years have witnessed extensive developments of
computer science applications in medicine - assistive technologies. Among
them, the concept of Brain-Computer-Interfaces, facilitating direct
communication between brain and computer, has inspired numerous
practical ideas on controlling an external device via neural signals. The
perception of an error made by oneself, another human or a machine,
triggers an error-related potential, which has already been exploited as a
binary correction readout for decisions made by Brain-ComputerInterfaces. Our approach takes advantage of this technique, while taking it
one step further regarding portability by using an affordable, robust and
wireless headset, the Emotiv EPOC+, to recognize error-related potentials
in electroencephalograms of subjects performing various on-site, dynamic
tasks. We also introduce a straightforward linear-discriminant analysis
classifier that extends the range of detection from offline, post-hoc
analysis, to online, within-trial recordings, an essential condition towards
blending machine-performed tasks with human-generated thought
processes in everyday life.

1 Introduction
Development of Brain-Computer-Interfaces (BCIs) has been driven primarily by their
clinical potential. For patients with neuromuscular disabilities, BCIs represent an
alternative communication and motor pathway, in the sense of an artifical bypass or
prothesis.
Throughout the last decades, milestones were reached when non-invasive, EEG-based
BCIs allowed patients with severe disability to move a cursor on a computer screen [1] or
even to regain partial mobility [2] using signals recorded from their primary sensor and
motor cortices.
Later, considerations regarding the practicability of sensory and motor cortex-based
non-invasive BCIs (high demand of cognitive attention and effort, lower spatial resolution

and speed of analysis, errors in recognizing human intentions) led to the appraisal of errorrelated potentials (ErrPs) as drivers of robotic tasks.
ErrPs constitute a particular type of evoked or event-related potentials (ERPs), i.e.
distinctly recordable neural responses to external stimuli, occuring specifically when, from
the perspective of a subject, an action should either no longer continue or ought to return to
an earlier stage. They can be detected directly via electroencephalography (EEG) from the
anterior medial frontal cortex [3] (corresponding roughly to area underneath the Cz
electrode).
At first, ErrPs were employed to correct a subject’s own actions [4], but were then
quickly extrapolated to adjust the observed movement performed by a robot during the
course of a binary task [5]. As is the case with other ERPs, the latency and amplitude of
ErrPs depend on the subject's perception of the importance of the error, the degree of
involvement of the subject in the task (the amplitude of the signal is lower if the subject
follows an external device passively than if it controls this device) and on the frequency of
the stimuli [4, 6, 7, 8].
Taking advantage of scientific 64-electrode EEG arrays, prompt and valid recognition
of correct/erratic robotic behaviour has been demonstrated with an accuracy of
approximately 70% even during live recordings [5].
The present study aims to extend the current research with respect to practicability
in the quotidian setting, by means of an affordable, robust and wireless headset, the
Emotiv EPOC +, employed in the analysis of ErrPs of subjects performing various on site, dynamic tasks. Furthermore, by validating a method of detection of the correctness
of an action that does not depend on the person's ability to move, the current study
makes a step towards a method of online study of these ErrP signals using inexpensive
and portable equipment.

2 Methods
Designing an algorithm for an ErrP-based BCI involves two stages: an initial one dedicated
to calibration and training, during which the acquired EEG signal helps to set the optimal
recording parameters, and another one for generating a classifier to discriminate the ErrP in
the live recording setting.
2.1 Signal acquisition
The reception of the evoked signal was made using the Emotiv EPOC+ headset with 14 (+2)
channels corresponding to the 14 electrodes that are placed directly on the scalp: AF 3, F7,
F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, AF4 (locations P3 and P4 represent CMS and
DRL electrodes, mass and reference potential, respectively).
The Emotiv headset is a portable, high-resolution EEG system with a single analog-todigital converter with a maximum sampling frequency of 256Hz. After conversion, brain
waves are preprocessed and the results are transmitted wirelessly to a USB receiver. This
step involves, among other things, a passage through a Notch filter of 0.2 - 43Hz.
The TestBench software attached to Emotiv EPOC+ provides a working interface that
displays real-time EEG data stream and monitors the quality of the contact areas between
electrodes and scalp through an impedance correlation index. Unlike most EEG systems
designed for research purposes, Emotiv EPOC + is not provided with hardware to integrate
event markers into the EEG data stream.
However, the TestBench software offers an event marking option via a serial port,
which enabled, in the case of the present study, its synchronization with the stimuli. Using a
Com0Com Null virtual port Emulator Modem, time markers were inserted into the EEG

simultaneously with signal acquisition (Fig.1). The Null-Modem Emulator is an opensource virtual kernel-mode serial port driver suitable for Windows and available under the
GPL license.

Fig. 1. Conceptual illustration of the experiment

Although, physiologically, the response mechanism of the brain to the perception of
an error is complex and involves more brain areas, basically it has been demonstrated
that the response to an error can be detected [3] from the anterior medial frontal cortex
(more precisely, the anterior cingulate cortex, ACC zone corresponding to the Cz
electrode). One downside to the compactness of the EPOC + headset was the lack of a
Cz electrode, so that our study focused on electrodes F 3, F4, FC5 and FC6, nearest to the
region of interest.
Three subjects (two males, one female, aged 27-60 years with no current relevant
ailments or symptoms) participated in the experiment. The recordings took place in a
quiet room, where the subjects were seated approximately 1 meter in front of a laptop
monitor (3200 x 1800 pixels, 13.3 inch screen diagonal).
For the visual stimulation task, subjects were presented with three quadratic visual
cues (located North, East and West) as well as a movable, blue quadratic pointer in the
centre of a black screen background (Fig. 1), programmed using Psychtoolbox. The
task consisted of moving the blue pointer in the direction of the green cue (the other
two being shown in red) with the arrow keys.
At a preprogrammed rate (25% of all trials) and in randomly chosen trials, the blue
pointer would erroneously move towards one red cue instead of the green one which
the subject would choose, thus providing a potential trigger for a feedback -related
ErrP.
Visual stimuli were set up in 3 blocks of 100 trials for two of the subjects and in 7
blocks of 100 trials for the other subject. The number of subject-committed errors (i.e.
pressing the wrong arrow key) were automatically displayed in the upper left corner of
the screen (Table 1) and their corresponding trials were removed from the subsequent
analysis.

Signal processing was performed in Matlab. To eliminate noise and reduce artifacts,
a 2-20Hz IIR bandwidth Butterworth filter order 5 with a passband ripple of 0.01dB
and 80dB of stopband attenuation was applied.

2.2 Classification
As a proof-of-principle, we used self-designed classifiers based on linear discriminant
analysis (LDA) to discern between standard and non-standard (error) epochs. Just to make
things clear, in contrast to a statistical test, the LDA does not directly answer the question
whether the ErrP during standard and non-standard epochs are statistically significantly
different from one another, but rather demonstrates pragmatically whether the epochs can
or cannot be differentiated from one another after training a discriminating classifier
algorithm.
The aim of our analysis in case of a positive outcome was to demonstrate the feasibility
of the coupling between a portable device (Emotiv EPOC+) and an algorithm in the online
separation of potential control signals of a BCI.
In case of LDA, discrimination between distinct event classes entails three steps:
calculating the separability between different classes by determining the distance between
class averages (the variance between classes), calculating the variance within the class as
the distance between the average and the class elements (or the within-class diffusion
matrix) and then generating a lower dimensionality space [10].
Therefore we first constructed a feature vector from preprocessed signal epochs, in three
separate ways, from within the same 100-500ms range from the onset of the stimulus: (1) as
averages calculated over 50ms intervals; (2) as average of all potentials from each sample;
(3) as averages calculated over 100-200ms, 200-300ms, 150-250ms, 300-400ms, 400500ms and 250-350ms, as previously described [5].
The between-class variance matrix of each of the two classes (standard and nonstandard), , was calculated as:

3 Results
For each of the
electrodes around the
region of interest (F 3,
F4, FC5 and FC6), we
calculated the difference
between grand averages
of ErrPs from error and,
respectively, non-error
epochs (examples in
Fig. 3).
A quantification of
the negative deviations
characteristic of the
ErrPs is best performed
after calculating the
amplitude
difference
between grand averages
of error and non-error
trails. This has the
advantage of eliminating
unspecific brain activity
during the two types of
trials, thus enhancing
specific
ErrP
components [11].

Due to the nature of the trials, the number of non-error vs error events/ epochs was
unbalanced towards the former, with machine-generated error events representing

approximately 25% of the total number of events/ epochs. Across sessions ErrPs
exhibited consistent morphology, suggesting that changes in the levels of awareness
and concentration do not exert a major influence on the signal shape.
Regarding EEG artefacts, the majority consisted of eye movement or blinking
artefacts as well as electrode movement artefacts. Muscle contraction artefacts were
prevented by instructing the subjects to produce only the minimum amount of
movement necessary to performing the task, which evidently renders the method less
applicable to everyday life. Elimination of artefact-laden epochs has been performed by
visual selection, but in order to scale the method to a larger number of subjects, hybrid
methods such as ICA (independent component analysis) coupled with visual selection
could increase efficiency.
One disadvantage inherent to the recording device is the lack of periocular
electrodes, essential in filtering out eye movement-related artefacts. This can be
partially overcome by reverting the position of the headset on the head, such that the
occipital electrodes act as supraorbital references.
The analysis was performed and yielded similar results on all four relevant
electrodes, but out of considerations of clarity it is shown in the subsequ ent figures and
tables only for electrode FC 6. Tables 2, 3 and 4 provide the three sets of values thus
obtained for electrode FC 6.
The implemented methods for discrimination analysis, linear (LDA) and quadratic
(QDA), originate from different assumptions regarding the covariance matrix of each
class, but share the prerequisites of normally distributed data sets and the existence of a
class-specific mean vector. In our case, when the number of features and thus the
dimensionality of the class matrix is relatively small, QDA yields more accurate results
(Tables 2-4). However, the larger the data sets, the more cumbersome the QDA
inherent calculations become, so that the more inflexible LDA can be regarded as a
more reasonable compromise.

Graphical outputs of both methods of discrimination are shown in Fig. 4A-D. The best
discrimination was achieved by quadratic discrimination, using all values within 100 500ms post-stimulus onset (Fig. 4D). The other methods and timeframes did not yield
satisfactory discriminations (Fig. 4B-C).

4 Conclusions and discussion
The LDA substantiated a difference between the average potentials of standard and nonstandard (error) epochs, allowing for correct discrimination with lower accuracy, of 19%, in
the case of linear discriminant classifiers, and, respectively, with a higher accuracy of 63%
for quadratic discriminant classifiers, thus approaching values obtained with professional
EEG recording systems (70% in [5]).

The resulting grand average difference ErrPs resemble those reported with professional
devices so far [4, 5] suggesting that they do not simply represent confounding effects of
various types of artifacts and noise. Even if, as explained above, this does not demonstrate
the ability of EPOC+ to validly record ErrPs, the results suggest that in spite of its limited
array of electrodes, Emotiv EPOC+ could represent a candidate portable device for an ErrPdriven BCI.
Limitations of our study included, on the non-systematic side, a very small number of
subjects with a subsequently wide variation between detection accuracies among the
discriminating classifiers, as well as, on the systematic side, the lack of suitably placed
electrodes due to the inherent construction of Emotiv EPOC+.
Future lines of development could involve applying LDA and QDA during live
recordings of ErrPs, extending the accuracy analysis to evaluate the positive and negative
predictive values of LDA in this context, along with recruiting more subjects to increase the
validity of ErrP recordings.
