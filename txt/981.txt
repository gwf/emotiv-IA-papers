Objective. Essential hypertension is associated with reduced pain sensitivity of unclear aetiology. This study explores this issue
using the Cold Pressor Test (CPT), a reliable pain/stress model, comparing CPT-related EEG activity in first episode hypertensives
and controls. Method. 22 untreated hypertensives and 18 matched normotensives underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure
monitoring (ABPM). EEG recordings were taken before, during, and after CPT exposure. Results. Significant group differences in
CPT-induced EEG oscillations were covaried with the most robust cardiovascular differentiators by means of a Canonical Analysis.
Positive correlations were noted between ABPM variables and Delta (1‚Äì4 Hz) oscillations during the tolerance phase; in highalpha (10‚Äì12 Hz) oscillations during the stress unit and posttest phase; and in low-alpha (8‚Äì10 Hz) oscillations during CPT phases
overall. Negative correlations were found between ABPM variables and Beta2 oscillations (16.5‚Äì20 Hz) during the posttest phase
and Gamma (28.5‚Äì45 Hz) oscillations during the CPT phases overall. These relationships were localised at several sites across the
cerebral hemispheres with predominance in the right hemisphere and left frontal lobe. Conclusions. These findings provide a starting
point for increasing our understanding of the complex relationships between cerebral activation and cardiovascular functioning
involved in regulating blood pressure changes.

1. Introduction
Hypertension is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular
disease and a major contributor to healthcare costs worldwide
[1]. Given that autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity
modulates transient changes in cardiovascular function,
autonomic dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension (EH) [2]. Increased sympathetic
activity [3] combined with parasympathetic inhibition may
contribute to increased cardiac activity and/or peripheral
vascular resistance and thereby to the early development of
hypertension [4], although patients with borderline to mild
hypertension often show normal vascular resistance at rest.

The central nervous system (CNS) has also been implicated in the aetiology and maintenance of some forms of
EH. The CNS is a target of the disease which, if untreated,
progresses to blood pressure (BP) levels threatening the
integrity of cerebral vessels, potentially inducing stroke
[5].
Considerable evidence supports the connection between
pain perception and BP regulation. It has been proposed
that acute BP increases may reduce pain, thus establishing
hypertension through instrumental learning [6]. Hypoalgesia
has been noted in animals and humans with high BP [7],
but the issue of whether it precedes or follows hypertension
remains equivocal.

The layman concept that stress can cause hypertension
still lacks strong empirical support. A review of studies
examining the relationship of stress and hypertension [8]
concluded that environmental measures of stress, such as
natural disasters, unsafe neighborhood conditions, and work
stress, were related to increased BP. In contrast, minimal
association was noted between self-rated stress and BP.
Pain sensations, consisting of sensory, affective, and
cognitive experiences, modulate EEG oscillations across a
wide range of frequency bands, presumably reflecting the
mechanisms involved in cortical activation and inhibition
[9, 10]. Several studies have investigated the impact of
experimental pain on human EEG. Most of these were based
on the cold pressure test (CPT). There is consensus that the
CPT produces decreased alpha EEG activity. Similarly, Beta
and Theta bands activity has previously been reported to
increase during CPT [11, 12].
Taking into consideration the issues presented above, the
current study attempted an integrative approach to the factors
interacting in the setting of hypertension. The objective
was to compare well-characterised, untreated hypertensives
and matched normotensive controls in terms of (i) arterial
blood pressure variables (24-hour ambulatory blood pressure
monitoring (ABPM)), (ii) CNS electrophysiological responsiveness (EEG), and (iii) behavioural responsiveness (pain
perception and tolerance) under exposure to sympathoexcitatory stress and pain induced by the CPT.
Although the impact of experimental pain on EEG has
attracted experimental interest, the existing available data do
not warrant the formulation of specific hypotheses regarding the relationship between brain oscillations and newly
diagnosed, untreated hypertension. Therefore this axis of our
design has an exploratory character.

2. Methods
2.1. Study Population. The hypertensive (HT) group consisted of 22 newly diagnosed untreated hypertensives (11 men,
11 women; mean age = 50.59 ¬± 11.45 years) referred to the
hypertensive centre of the Department of Clinical Therapeutics (Athens University, Greece). The normotensive control
(NT) group included 18 healthy volunteers (8 men and 10
women, mean age = 51.72 ¬± 8.33 years). All 40 participants

were ambulatory and the two groups were matched for sex,
age, and body mass index. They all fulfilled the following
inclusion criteria: (1) no previous antihypertensive treatment; (2) absence of clinical signs or laboratory evidence of
hypertension-related complications (coronary artery disease,
heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal insufficiency, or
peripheral artery disease) or of secondary causes of arterial
hypertension; (3) absence of any other systematic disease; (4)
absence of psychiatric disorders or psychiatric medication;
(5) at least three valid BP measurements per hour over
24 hr ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM: 75%
successful measurements). The cohort was initially evaluated
by 24-hour ABPM and subjects were divided into 2 groups in
terms of their ABPM measurements objectively on the basis
of this measurement. Individuals with 24-hour ambulatory
BP <130/80 mmHg were placed in the NT group; individuals
with 24-hour ambulatory BP ‚â•130/80 mmHg were placed
in the HT group. All subjects gave their informed consent
for participation in the study, and the study protocol was
approved by the hospital ethics review committee to ensure
that the procedures followed were in accordance with the
institutional guidelines.
2.2. Procedure. Participants were instructed to abstain from
alcohol, cigarette smoking, coffee/tea, and exercise for at least
30 minutes prior to testing. The study flow diagram can be
seen in Table 1.
2.2.1. The 24-Hour ABPM Measurement [13, 14]. 24-hour
ABPM was conducted on all subjects on a usual working day
by means of the Spacelabs 90217 ambulatory blood pressure
monitor (Spacelabs Inc., Redmond, Wash). The appropriate
sized cuff was placed around the nondominant arm and 3
consecutive blood pressure determinations were recorded
along with sphygmomanometric measurements to verify that
there was no difference greater than 5 mmHg on the average
of the 2 sets of values. Throughout the 24-hour monitoring
readings were obtained automatically at 15-minute intervals
and all subjects had at least 3 valid readings per hour. The
resulting 80 to 96 pairs of systolic and diastolic BP readings
per recording with the corresponding recording time were
used to calculate blood pressure derivatives. All subjects were
instructed to maintain their usual daytime activities between

International Journal of Hypertension
6:00 AM and 10:00 PM and rest-sleep between 10:00 PM
and 6:00 AM [13]. In this context it is useful to outline
the time rate (TR) of BP variation. The TR of BP variation
was defined as the first derivative of the BP values against
time and was calculated as the mean of the absolute ratios
of the differences between successive BPs and the minutes
between them. Details concerning the TR estimation have
been described elsewhere [14]. This parameter focuses on the
subsequent changes between consecutive BP recordings, how
fast or how slow and in which direction BP values change,
and is more sensitive to the sequential order of BP readings
than the standard deviation index, which merely reflects the
upward and downward BP excursions around the mean.
2.2.2. Cold Pressor Test (CPT). The CPT is a method commonly used to evoke a sympathoexcitatory stress response
[15, 16]. Testing was conducted by trained experimenters in a
quiet room. The cap for wireless EEG recording was attached,
and the following EEG recording phases were carried out: (i)
3 min resting baseline period; (ii) immersion of the left hand
to just above the wrist in a 2‚àò C water bath with eyes closed
for 1 min (unit of stress); (iii) continued immersion in the
2‚àò C water bath until the participant, as previously directed,
spontaneously withdrew the hand due to intolerability of the
cold (pain tolerance assessment); (iv) 3 min resting/recovery
phase. Time of immersion, time of 1 min exposure to the
cold (‚Äúunit‚Äù of stress), and time of withdrawal of the hand
(tolerance) were recorded. The CPT was well tolerated by
all subjects, with no adverse effects noted. EEG monitoring
during the CPT: EEG recording was continuous through the
3 min resting phase preceding the CPT, the 1st CPT minute
(stress unit), the pain tolerance assessment phase, and the
concluding 3 min post-CPT phase.
EEG data collection and analysis: for acquiring the EEG
data, the EMOTIV Epoc EEG system was used (EMOTIV,
20141). This device has a wireless amplifier, and 14 wet saline
electrodes, corresponding at the positions AF3, F7, F3, FC5,
T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, and AF4 according to the
international 10‚Äì20 system (see Figure 7).
The device has also an embedded 16-bit ADC which was
used to digitize the data with 128 Hz sampling frequency per
channel. The data were sent via Bluetooth to a computer with
the EMOTIV Control Panel software installed, allowing the
visual monitoring of the impedance of the electrode contact
to the scalp. The EMOTIV Epoc EEG device is part of a
number of low-cost EEG systems, which have been recently
applied for research aims. However, recent research assessing
their reliability provides converging evidence indicating their
capacity to measure consistently EEG signals [17‚Äì20].
Two electrodes located just above the subject‚Äôs ears (P3,
P4) were used as reference. Electrode resistance was kept
constantly below 5 kŒ©. The EEG signals were band-passed
filtered with Butterworth 0.5‚Äì8 Hz, 8‚Äì12 Hz, 12‚Äì28 Hz, and
28‚Äì45.5 Hz filters.
In order to analyse the data from the experimental setup, a
wavelet-based analysis was performed using EEGLAB 13.5.4b
[21], an open-source toolbox for MATLAB (Mathworks, Inc.,
Natick, MA, USA). The data processing in our work is based
on the wavelet transform, ùëäùë• (ùë°, ùëì), that permits the accurate

3
decomposition of EEG waveforms into a set of component
waveforms allowing the isolation of all scales of waveform
structure [22]. According to this method, the complex Morlet
wavelet is chosen as a mother wavelet, Œ®(ùë°), to be convolved
with the original signal, ùë•(ùë°). This convolution leads to a new
signal, ùëäùë•Œ® (ùëè, ùëé), with ùëè denoting the translation parameter
and ùëé the wavelet‚Äôs scaling parameter. This signal consisted of
coefficients which denote the correlation between the EEG
signal and the wavelet function. In order to approximate
the continuous wavelet transform, the convolution with the
signal has to be done ùëÅ times for each scale, where ùëÅ is
the number of points in the signal time series. Although
the choice of ùëÅ could be arbitrary, given the fact that the
exact number of time segment data points of all CPT phases
was known beforehand, the appropriate choice of repeated
convolutions was made resulting in comparable wavelet
coefficients for all time segments. Nevertheless, the wavelet
transforms at each scale ùëé have to be directly comparable
to each other and to the transforms of other time series, so
the wavelet function was normalized to have unit energy at
all times. The wavelet power spectrum was then computed
as |ùëäùë• (ùë°, ùëì)2 | or as |ùëäùë• (ùëè, ùëé)2 | in terms of translation and
shifting parameters.
Furthermore, certain coefficients will be generated corresponding to the noise affected zones and some other
coefficients will be generated in the areas corresponding to
the actual EEG. Although these coefficients are associated
with frequency components, they are modified in the time
domain, where each coefficient corresponds to a time range.
An appropriate choice of wavelet coefficients would result in
removing the noisy part of the EEG signal to some extent,
while retaining the useful part of the signal [23]. Noise
filtering is therefore implemented simply by zeroing out any
coefficients associated primarily with noise.
For each electrode the total measurements were divided
into four time segments based on the previous described
experimental procedure. The wavelet coefficients were split
into the following eight standardized bands: Delta (1‚Äì4 Hz),
Theta1 (4‚Äì6 Hz), Theta2 (6‚Äì8 Hz), Alpha1 (8‚Äì10 Hz), Alpha2
(10‚Äì12 Hz), Beta1 (12.5‚Äì16 Hz), Beta2 (16.5‚Äì20 Hz), Beta3
(20.5‚Äì28 Hz), and Gamma (28.5‚Äì45 Hz). The wavelet cycles
of the transform were dynamically increased so that the time
width of the wavelet corresponding to the highest frequency
of the Gamma band is to be half the time width of that related
to the lowest frequency of the Delta band, thus, allowing a
higher frequency resolution (resulting from 3 cycles at 1 Hz
to above 67 cycles at 45 Hz). The wavelet coefficients were
averaged over time and then scales contained within each
frequency band were summed together to yield the absolute
activity within each band [12, 24]. For each time segment and
frequency band, the Power Spectral Density was calculated by
integrating the corresponding wavelet scalogram over time.

3. Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with the STATISTICA 12.0
software for Windows. A first analysis involved a betweengroup, Repeated Measures design. Power spectrum density of
EEG recordings from 14 electrodes was expressed as Delta,

Theta1, Theta2, Alpha1, Alpha2, Beta1, Beta2, Beta3, and
Gamma values. Each frequency was analysed as a dependent
variable in separate, 1-way Repeated Measures ANOVAs. In
each ANOVA, the independent variable was Group Membership ((1) normotensive controls versus (2) hypertensives);
the Repeated Measures factor was phase, which included four
levels corresponding to the stages of the Cold Pressor Test ((1)
pretest resting phase, (2) stress unit phase, (3) tolerance phase,
and (4) posttest resting phase). Special attention was given to
interactions as those would provide the strongest evidence as
to differential response profiles of hypertensives versus controls. The overall relationship among the clinical and the EEG
variables was further investigated by Canonical Analysis; in
order to ascertain the relative significance of the variables
they showed the highest individual association with the two
states of the subjects (i.e., healthy controls and hypertensives).
On the left side of the equation we chose those EEG variables
that clearly and statistically significant showed an interaction effect via the standard Repeated Measures ANOVA
paradigm. Each subgroup of these variables was analysed
separately so four Canonical Analyses were carried out, one
for each group, that is, Gamma, Alpha1, Alpha2, Delta, and
Theta1. On the right side of the equation we chose Maximum Diastolic Blood Pressure of the day (Max DBP day),
Minimum Heart Rate of the day (Min HR day), Mean Blood
Pressure 24 hours (Mean MBP24), and Minimum Diastolic
Blood Pressure of the day (Min DBP day) by performing Discriminant Function Analysis that included all clinical variables and controls/hypertensives as the dependent
variable.
We also performed the standard Student‚Äôs ùë°-test to check
for differences between the groups regarding the behavioural
performance in the pain tolerance of the subjects.

4. Results
4.1. Behavioural Variables. There was no significant difference between normotensives and hypertensives although
a tendency was revealed towards greater pain tolerance
in hypertensives measured as self-determined duration
(min) of exposure to the cold bath (mean tolerance, controls = 4.62 ¬± 1.32 min; hypertensives 6.02 ¬± 2.79 min;
ùëù = 0.059).
4.2. Arterial Blood Pressure Variables. Overall the ABPM
variables differed significantly between the two compared
groups; however a Discriminant Function Analysis revealed
the four most differentiators variables; see Table 2.

4.3. EEG Data. A significant main effect of phase was noted
in several electrodes (Delta: O2 and F8; Theta1: F3; Alpha1: O2
and P8; Alpha2: F3 and AF4; Beta2: F3 and F4; and, finally, in
Gamma electrodes AF3 and F7). Overall, signals tended to
rise during the tolerance phase and drop during the posttest
resting phase.
However, the central finding was the interactions
observed between Group Membership and phase. Analyses
revealed interactions in Delta, Theta1, Alpha1, Alpha2,
Beta2, and Gamma values. In examining this relationship
we encountered four distinct response patterns which
support our hypothesis that hypertensives have a differential
electrophysiological response profile to environmental
stimuli as those are simulated by the phases of the Cold
Pressor Test.
4.3.1. Delta Brain Activity (DBA). DBA at F3 and P8 leads
had higher values for hypertensives than controls overall
and particularly in the tolerance and posttest phases. A
similar finding was noted for electrode O2 but with a
greater difference between the two groups, with controls
showing a continuous value decline from pretest to posttest.
In the control group, lead F4 showed a sharp value drop
at the posttest phase, whereas hypertensives demonstrated
a slight increase at the same phase. In the control group
the AF4 lead revealed a steady drop from the beginning
of the procedure to the end, similarly to the O2 lead; in
contrast, the hypertensives group sustained the same level
of activity in all four experimental phases (Table 3, Figures
1 and 7). All five interactions were statistically significant
(Table 3).
TBA 1 at F3 and AF4 leads produced a statistically
significant interaction (Table 6), with hypertensives showing
overall higher values peaking in the tolerance phase. In the
same phase controls demonstrated a considerable value drop
during the tolerance phase (Table 4, Figures 2 and 7).
Overall, ABA 1 values at O2 and P8 leads were higher
in hypertensives than controls throughout the experiment,
whereas controls showed a significant drop in the posttest
resting phase (Table 5, Figures 3 and 7). This was a statistically
significant interaction (Table 5).
In the case of Alpha1 electrode P8 the statistically significant interaction was due to the within the control group
drop in the Power Spectral Density value at the posttest phase
compared to the pretest (ùëù = 0.001) rather than between the
groups as noted in most measurements.
4.3.2. Alpha2 Brain Activity (A2BA). A2BA values showed
significant interactions at leads AF3, F3, and AF4. The results
followed a different pattern from that noted with A1BA. Both
groups had similar values during the pretest, with the control
group subsequently showing a marked drop during the stress
unit phase. In contrast, in that phase hypertensives actually
showed a small rise, which levelled off during the tolerance
and the posttest phases (Table 6, Figures 4 and 7). These
differences were statistically significant (Table 6).
B2BA showed a statistically significant interaction for lead
Œ§8 (Table 7). Hypertensives had lower values at the pretest
resting phase and also at the tolerance and posttest resting

phase, compared to healthy controls (Table 7, Figures 5 and

As in the case of Alpha1 electrode P8 the statistically
significant interaction in Beta2 electrode T8 was due to the
within the control group rise in the Power Spectral Density
value at the posttest phase compared to the stress unit phase
(ùëù = 0.02) rather than between the groups as noted in most
measurements.
4.3.3. Gamma Brain Activity (GBA). GBA values for leads T8,
AF3, AF4, and FC6 revealed statistically significant Group X
Phase interactions (Table 8). Multiple comparisons indicated
AF3 values were lower in hypertensives at the pretest phase
and again lower at the posttest phase whereas they were
similar to controls during the stress unit and the tolerance
phase.
T8 values showed the greatest difference between the two
groups during the tolerance phase with hypertensives having
higher values than controls.

The electrode FC6 recordings showed a general higher
value range for controls especially during the tolerance and
the posttest phases (Table 8, Figures 6 and 7).
Once more, the statistically significant interaction for
Gamma electrode AF3 was due to statistically significant
differences in the Power Spectral Density values what were
noted in the hypertensives group who had a sharp rise from
the pretest to the stress unit phase (ùëù = 0.001) and the
tolerance phase (ùëù = 0.000) whereas no such changes
were observed in the controls group whose values remained
similar throughout the entire experiment.
On the left side of the equation we chose those EEG
variables that clearly and statistically significantly showed
an interaction effect via the standard Repeated Measures
ANOVA paradigm. Each subgroup of these variables was
analysed separately so four Canonical Analyses were carried
out, one for each group, that is, Gamma, Alpha1, Alpha2,
Delta, and Theta1. On the right side of the equation we
chose Max DBP day, Min HR day, Min MBP24, and Min

included all clinical variables and controls/hypertensives as

useful in deciding which set of variables is best in discriminating between groups of subjects and thus suitable for our

5. Discussion
The study explored putative relationships between arterial
blood pressure variables (24 hr ABPM) and electrophysiological responsiveness (EEG activity) elicited by exposure
to sympathoexcitatory stress/pain induced by the CPT in
untreated hypertensives and normotensive controls.
Although the two groups differed significantly in all
arterial blood pressure variables, a Discriminant Function
Analysis revealed that the most robust group differentiators
were four: Maximum Diastolic Blood Pressure of the day
(Max DBP day), Minimum Heart Rate of the day (Min HR
day), Mean Blood Pressure 24 hours (Mean MBP 24), and
Minimum Diastolic Blood Pressure of the day (Min DBP
day).
An initial series of ANOVA analyses determined significant group differences in CPT-induced EEG oscillations,
which were then covaried with the four most robust cardiovascular differentiators by means of Canonical Analyses.
This revealed positive correlations between cardiovascular

variables and Delta oscillations (1‚Äì4 Hz) during the tolerance phase; in high-alpha oscillations (10‚Äì12 Hz) during the
stress unit and posttest phase; and in low-alpha oscillations
(8‚Äì10 Hz) during all four CPT phases.
In contrast, negative correlations were noted between cardiovascular variables and Beta2 oscillations (16.5‚Äì20 Hz) during the posttest phase and Gamma oscillations (28.5‚Äì45 Hz)
during all four CPT phases.
These associations were localised at several sites across the
cerebral hemispheres, predominantly in the right one, and in
left frontal lobe.
On the behavioural level, pain tolerance measured in
terms of self-determined exposure to the CPT ice bath
beyond the obligatory 1 min stress unit phase revealed a tendency towards greater tolerance in hypertensives, although
this did not reach statistical significance (ùëù = 0.059).

This is in line with previous findings indicating hypoalgesia
in hypertensives. Hypertension-associated hypoalgesia has
important clinical implications, the first of which relates to
the phenomenon of silent myocardial ischemia and infarcts
which are significantly more common in hypertensives than
in normotensives [7, 25].
Given the multiplicity of electrophysiological observations based on the initial ANOVAs analyses, for the purposes
of this discussion we have focused on the instances where the
Canonical Correlation Analysis revealed strong relationships
between the cardiovascular and electrophysiological group
differentiators of the study.

animal studies suggesting that increased cerebral activity in
the spectrum of DBA is associated with increased arterial
pressure, probably mediated through suppressed baroreflex
control of heart rate [26, 27]. DBA enhancement during
perceptual tasks has been associated with functional cortical
‚Äúdeafferentation,‚Äù that is, inhibition of sensory bottom-up
interferences with internal concentration. It has been proposed that this is a sign of neuronal rearrangement phenomena in the acute and chronic phases of recovery [28]. The
sustained increase in DBA activity noted in our hypertensive
group is compatible with previous findings suggesting ‚Äúsuper
efforts‚Äù in untreated essential hypertension, possibly due to
hypoactivation of the reinforcement system combined with
compromised functioning of the brain serotonin system [29,
30].
DBA correlations were noted in the left frontal and
the right occipital areas. This is consistent with evidence
that DBA is involved in cortical communication over long
distances [31]. Yener and colleagues [32] suggested that there
were two different networks activated in DBA in response
to different stimulus modalities, according to the stimulation
characteristics and sensory or cognitive demands.
5.2. Alpha Brain Activity, High (10‚Äì12 Hz: A2BA) and Low
(8‚Äì10 Hz: A1BA). Our findings revealed positive correlations
between cardiovascular variables and high (10‚Äì12 Hz) alpha
oscillations during the CPT stress unit and posttest phases
and in low (8‚Äì10 Hz) alpha oscillations during the 4 CPT
phases overall. The high-alpha subband (A2BA) is considered
an index of task-specific sensorimotor activity regulation
[33], mainly related to attentional processes [34]: optimal
task performance requires inhibition of task-irrelevant areas,
which is reflected as high-alpha oscillatory activity facilitating
better resource allocation to task-relevant areas [35, 36].
The lower the amplitude of alpha oscillations the better the
information transfer through sensorimotor thalamocortical

and corticocortical pathways [37]. The CPT is a commonly
used method for eliciting primarily sympathetic activation
during periods of stress. Hence our finding regarding highalpha power may underline the positive link between stress
and a top-down inhibitory mechanism which, in our study,
appears deficient in hypertensives. In line with this view there
are findings of increased heart rate and blood pressure in high
hostile individuals when exposed to stressful conditions such
as the CPT [38].
The low-alpha subband (A1BA) is considered an index
of general tonic alertness [33]. The different response of our
two groups to pain-related processing may reflect changes of
cortical excitability related to the special alerting function of
preceding pain [38].

It is a reasonable assumption that the pretest brain
oscillations noted in our study may be explained in terms
of anticipation of pain. Such anticipation can cause mood
changes and behavioural adaptations which may influence
subsequent pain perception [39, 40]. It has been shown [34]
that the magnitude of a nociceptively induced alpha oscillation related desynchronization (a-ERD) was significantly
more dependent on prestimulus than on poststimulus alpha
power. A more recent study [41] showed that prestimulus
EEG oscillations in the alpha frequency band modulated the
subjective perception of painful stimuli: prestimulus alpha
oscillatory activities in fact assisted in predicting subjective
pain perception. This notion is in line with reports indicating
that decreased low-alpha brain oscillations are correlated
with higher numerical pain scores collected during both
resting-state and noxious conditions by the application of
tonic noxious stimuli [42].
5.3. Beta2 Brain Activity (16.5‚Äì20 Hz, B2BA). A negative
correlation was noted between cardiovascular variables and
B2BA during the posttest phase. Given that Beta brain activity
plays a role in motor processing, a possible interpretation

of this correlation is that pain-related B2BA modulations
reflect the preparation and execution of a defensive response
[43]. This view is consistent with recent reports showing
negative correlations between Beta oscillations and sympathetic activity subserving the interaction between brain
neural populations involved in somatomotor control and
brain neural populations regulating ANS signals to heart
[44].
5.4. Gamma Brain Activity (GBA). A negative correlation between GBA and cardiovascular group differentiators
emerged from our study. GBA is considered to play a crucial
role in cortical integration and perception [45]. Brief painful
stimuli induce GBA in somatosensory cortices [10, 46], probably reflecting local sensory processing in the somatosensory
cortex [47].
In contrast, longer-lasting painful stimulation (perception of tonic pain) does not appear to be encoded by GBA in
the somatosensory cortex, but rather in the medial prefrontal
cortex, close to premotor and cingulate cortices [48]. This
GBA encoding of tonic pain might indicate that the subjective
perception of longer-lasting pain is more dependent on

contextual/emotional processes than on the sensory ones
which determine perception of brief painful stimuli. The
GBA modulation in our study may be considered in this
light.
Previous studies have shown that GBA is enhanced
during attentional selection of sensory information [49].
Additionally GBA modulations over the somatosensory cortex are enhanced by attention and vary with pain processing
[10, 38, 49]. Thus the enhancement of GBA in our hypertensive group, over the contralateral somatosensory cortex
may be related to subjective pain intensity and reflect the
internal representations of behaviourally relevant stimuli that
should receive enhanced/preferred processing [10, 38]. GBA
observed in the pretest (anticipatory) phase of our procedure
may be explained in terms of anticipation of pain, causing
mood changes and behavioural adaptations which may then
influence perception of subsequent pain [50].
In the service of adaptive environmental engagement
low coping capacity has been associated with a more pronounced decrease in GBA [51]. Hence the negative correlations obtained between GBA and cardiovascular variables
across CPT phases would seem to confirm this perspective.

It is compatible with converging evidence which consistently
indicates significant involvement of GBA in hemodynamic
fluctuations being mediated by the bidirectional connections
between neuronal substrates underlying GBA and autonomic
responses [52, 53].
As a whole, the correlations we noted between brain
oscillations and cardiovascular parameters may be better
understood in the light of reports suggesting that cognitive
alterations depend upon the degree of hypertension. It is
established that the systolic and diastolic blood pressures
have effects on distinct cognitive domains [54, 55]. Anson
and Paran [56] and Gupta et al. [57] endorsed the view that
systolic and diastolic hypertension may also affect cognitive
measures in a different way.
Furthermore, the relative scalp locations of differences
in magnitude of cerebral activation between the two hemispheres could determine the overall changes in blood pressure and heart rate. This idea is supportive to the view,
which states that the two cerebral hemispheres act in concert
to promote changes in cardiovascular functioning; however,
the right hemisphere predominantly modulates sympathetic
efferents, while the left hemisphere predominantly modulates

parasympathetic efferents, of the autonomic nervous system
[58].
In conclusion, our results add to a growing body of
evidence that the brain is implicated in the initiation of high
blood pressure while it is itself altered by early disease processes. Thus the brain and vasculature may be independently
and concurrently targeted by the factors inducing essential
hypertension [59].
Previous studies have thoroughly evaluated the impact of
TR of BP variation on target organ damage. A cross-sectional
study in 514 normotensive and uncomplicated hypertensive
patients demonstrated that the 24-hour rate of systolic BP
variation was greater in hypertensive than in normotensive
subjects and was the only office or ambulatory BP monitoring parameter that was linearly and independently associated with carotid intima-media thickening [14]. Moreover,
another study of our group illustrated that the TR of BP variation, derived from computerized analysis of ambulatory BP
monitoring data, is superior to central hemodynamics as an
associate of carotid intima-media thickness in hypertensive
and normotensive individuals [60]. Additionally, a marker
of increased cardiovascular risk, left ventricular mass was

linearly and independently related to the daytime rate of SBP
variation in hypertensive patients [61]. The former correlation
persisted after adjustment for vascular risk factors, body
habitus, BP and HR levels, BPV, and nocturnal BP dipping.
Furthermore, Manios et al. demonstrated that increased TR
of BP variation was independently associated with impaired
renal function and coronary atherosclerosis in hypertensive
and normotensive subjects, respectively [62, 63]. Moreover,
recent studies in acute stroke patients showed that higher
TR of BP variation values were associated with brain edema
formation and poor outcome [64, 65]. These findings indicate
that steeper BP variations may produce a greater stress on the
arterial wall and may have an additive role to vascular risk
factors and BP parameters in the detection of target organ
damage development.
Our results also demonstrate the advantage of simultaneous EEG recording under well-defined pain inducing conditions. Our approach of factoring contributions from multiple,
interconnected brain processes is relevant to all studies
which attempt to link evoked brain responses with behaviour
and demonstrates that exploiting these interactions leads
to a more complete understanding of brain response to

experience of pain.

5.5. Limitations. A number of limitations must be considered
when interpreting the findings of the current study. First,
the study relied on a relatively small sample. Second, we
employed CPT as a measure of pain. Although this approach
is consistent with the literature, we cannot necessarily generalize the current results to other types of painful stimuli,
such as thermal stimuli. Third, an additional limitation relates
to the fact that EEG and cardiovascular measurements were
noncontemporaneous. This potentially limits the findings in
that the two measures were not precisely coupled. Fourth,
data were collected in a single testing session. Therefore,
we cannot comment on the stability of the relation between
hypertension and EEG activity over time.
Nevertheless, the study adds to the understanding of
the role of brain oscillations evoked by stress and/or pain
stimulation in the underlying mechanisms of hypertension.
Our data suggest that brain oscillations in response to
stress and/or pain challenge may give greater insight into
underlying systems and the mechanisms of hypertension.

6. Conclusions
EEG recorded in the course of the CPT provides a measure of
cortical activity, on the basis of which untreated hypertensives
may be differentiated from healthy controls. Furthermore,
the method utilized in this study helps isolate pain-related
features in the EEG during CPT in association with cardiovascular variables. This lends credibility to the hypothesis that
top-down and bottom-up control mechanisms are implicated
in the development of hypertension. Future applications of
the methodology may help identify specific EEG features
related to the neuronal processing of pain perception in
hypertension.
