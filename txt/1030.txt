Abstract: This study focuses on the problem of eye irritation when measuring steady-state visual
evoked potentials (SSVEPs) using a brain–computer interface and aims to clarify experimentally
visual stimulus signals that do not cause discomfort to users. To this end, a method is proposed
that introduces a flash stimulus in which the color is changed by changing its hue. This reduces the
change in brightness while providing a color change, thereby facilitating visual stimulation with
less discomfort. In experiments conducted, flash stimuli of the primary colors red, green, and blue
and colors with different hues of 5–45◦ from these primary colors were generated to investigate the
algorithm accuracy of SSVEP and discomfort. Subjective questionnaire and CFF values, which are
ophthalmic parameters, were obtained for the subjects and compared to the discrimination rate. As
a result of the comparison, it was confirmed that the fatigue level of the visual stimulus generated
by the proposed hue change was lower than that of the conventional black-and-white stimulus. It
was also confirmed that the combination of the hue difference and frequency could obtain the same
discrimination rate as the conventional method.

The development of interfaces that can be intuitively operated in various electronic
devices is advancing, and various devices have been developed that make it easy for
the general public to understand how to operate them through touch panels and other
means. However, because most human–machine interfaces, including those that allow
such intuitive manipulation, are often difficult to operate for severely disabled persons, the
use of electroencephalograms (EEGs), which are also available for physical disabilities, has
been attracting increasing attention [1].
There are two ways to measure EEG: (1) invasive brain–machine interface/brain–
computer interface (BMI/BCI) in which electrodes are implanted directly into the brain; (2)
non-invasive BMI/BCI in which electrodes are placed on the scalp and EEG is extracted. In
recent years, noninvasive BMI/BCI has been attracting more attention because it is less
burdensome on the subject [2].
One commonly employed BCI method is the use of visual stimuli, such as fastblinking optical signals [3]. EEG has the ability to register responses to visual stimuli,
and the potential generated in the cerebral cortical visual cortex by visual stimuli is called
visual evoked potential (VEP). Visual stimuli are frequently presented to cause/elicit visual
evoked potentials, and the potential generated for periodic visual stimuli is called steadystate visual evoked potential (SSVEP); it is tuned to the same frequencies and harmonic
components as the presented periodic visual stimuli [4]. Thus, SSVEP can be used to

2.3. Obtaining and Analyzing SSVEP
Emotiv Epoc+, an electroencephalogram measuring device that is noninvasive to
the body, was used to measure the EEG. Its electrodes are dedicated saline-based wet
electrodes, and they contact the scalp through electrolyte-impregnated sponges at 14 sites:
AF3, AF4, F7, F8, F3, F4, FC4, FC5, T7, T8, P7, P8, O1, O2. SSVEP can be measured using
the electrodes close to the occipital region where the visual cortex is located. In previous
reports [8], the measurement of SSVEP was reported using the electrodes of Emotiv Epoc+
at the occipital region (O1, O2). The occipital region (O1, O2) was also used in this study.
In the analysis of the acquired EEG data, frequency information is extracted from
multi-channel EEG using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) [9]. In CCA, the data from
one signal can be divided into a unique signal (proprietary signal), communication signal,
and noise. Only a signal common to multiple signal data is extracted and selected. It is
possible to obtain accurate SSVEP by obtaining common EEGs from the signals of the two
channels obtained from the two sites (O1, O2).
For CCA, a reference signal was generated for 30, 20, 15, 12, 10, 7.5, 6, 5, and 4 Hz,
respectively. CCA was used to calculate the canonical correlation coefficient for each of
the nine artificial reference signals generated from the EEG data. The extracted frequency
corresponds to the reference signal with the highest correlation coefficient and is acquired
from the EEG data through multiple trials. Then, accuracy is calculated from Equation (1):
accuracy =

corr
,
N

(1)

where corr is the number of trials necessary to obtain the correct prediction, and N is the
total number of trials.
2.4. Measurement of Visual Fatigue
Visual fatigue was assessed by measuring and evaluating subjective evaluation responses (12 symptoms considering general discomfort and eye fatigue), signal flickering
response after each set of colors, and critical fusion frequency (CFF) values and ophthalmic
parameters before and after the experiment. Twelve symptoms [10] of common discomfort
and eye fatigue were scored on five-point scales in a subjective questionnaire (1 = none,
2 = slight, 3 = moderate, 4 = clear, 5 = severe). The subjective evaluation of the signal flicker
when observing the flashing signal was called flicker rating and was rated on three levels
by a subjective questionnaire (1 = none, 2 = slight, 3 = clear). The frequency threshold value
at which a blinking sensation is generated is called the CFF value [11,12]. The CFF value
has been reported to decrease with the accumulation of fatigue [13]. Therefore, it is widely
used in the field of ergonomics and occupational health as a test for mental fatigue. In our
experiment, the CFF value was measured by decreasing the frequency threshold by 1 Hz
every 5 s from 45 Hz using a red LED and acquiring the frequency threshold at which a
blinking sensation was generated. Measurements were performed on both eyes. Measured
CFF values were evaluated by comparing changes before and after the experiment.
2.5. Preparation of Experiment
The flash stimulus was altered using a pair of colors with hue differences of 5◦ to 45◦ ,
based on the three primary colors of red (0◦ ), blue (120◦ ), and green (240◦ ), to determine
a signal with the highest SSVEP recognition accuracy and no discomfort. As described
above, the visual stimulus consisted of nine signals at 30, 20, 15, 12, 10, 7.5, 6, 5, and 4 Hz
displayed as a set.
Two parts of the occipital region (O1 and O2) were used for EEG measurements. The
application attached to Emotiv Epoc+ adjusted the contact condition of all the electrodes
to the best (green) condition in order to optimally mount the electrode in contact with the
scalp. This allowed for optimum EEG data to be obtained. Emotiv Epoc+ EEG data were
transmitted to the PC via Bluetooth at a sampling rate of 256 Hz.

vision and irritated eyes. The subjective questionnaire results show that many participants
experienced eye strain. In addition, from the result of the CFF value, the average value was
approximately +2 for both eyes in the black-and-white flash stimulation of the conventional
method (Figure 5). Therefore, it is clear that using the visual stimuli of the conventional
method causes fatigue.
For all the hues and hue differences of the proposed method, there was some variation
in the CFF change, but the change in fatigue was less than that of the conventional method.
The mean change in fatigue was almost always between −1 and +1 (Figures 8, 10 and 12).
The only visual stimuli that were above this range were R45 and G5. The results for
these two signals were also closer to 1 than to 2. From these results, we can confirm that
the proposed method reduces the accumulation of fatigue compared to the conventional
method. From the results of the subjective questionnaire for each hue of the proposed
method, it was confirmed that the eye strain of the proposed method was lower than that
of the conventional method for red visual stimuli with a hue difference of 20◦ or less from
R5 to R20. For blurred vision and irritated eyes, the eye strain was lower than that of the
conventional method for all hue differences from R5 to R45. The average flicker rating
for the lowest hue difference was approximately 2. However, we can confirm that the
red visual stimuli were slightly more accurate than the conventional method. For green
visual stimuli, eye strain, blurred vision and irritated eye were lower than the conventional
method for all hue differences from G5 to G45. From G35 to G45, the flicker rating was
the same as that of the conventional method, and from G5 to G15, the flicker rating was
less than 2, and the discrimination rate was significantly reduced. For blue visual stimuli,
eye strain was similar to the conventional method for B30 and B40, and any other hue
difference was found to be reduced. In addition, blurred vision and irritated eyes were
lower for all hue differences from B5 to B45 than with the conventional method. For flicker
rating, it was the same as the conventional method for B15 to B45, and the discrimination
rate was slightly lower than the conventional method for all hue differences. These results
indicate that the generation of visual stimuli by hue change can reduce the degree of fatigue
caused by visual stimuli compared to the conventional method and can obtain the same
level of discrimination rate.
Next, we discuss the detailed discrimination rate for each frequency of each hue. The
results for each hue are shown in Appendix A.
Based on the results of red (0◦ ) in Figure A1, the algorithm accuracy rate exceeded
an average of 60% for all signals from R5 to R45, especially from 30 to 6 Hz, with small
standard deviations and high mean values. An EEG analysis of, for example, a 15 Hz flash
stimulus under gaze has been reported in [4] to reveal a large 15 Hz component, as well
as a twofold and threefold harmonic, called a double frequency. Similarly, for 4 and 5 Hz,
the algorithm accuracy rate may be reduced because of the misidentification of double
frequencies of 10, 12, and 15 Hz. As the subjective questionnaire result of eye strain for the
conventional method was 2.333 on average, we can say that the signals for R20–R45 have
the same algorithm accuracy rate as the flash stimulus signals of the conventional method,
with fatigue reduced by up to 15%. In addition, the subjective questionnaire result of eye
fatigue for R5–R15 is approximately 1.5. Hence, the signal of R5–R15 is reduced eye fatigue
by approximately 35.71% compared to the conventional method, and it is confirmed that
the algorithm accuracy rate obtained is the same as that of the conventional method.
Based on the results of green (120◦ ) in Figure A3, the algorithm accuracy rate is low for
G5 to G15 signals. This is because the flicker rating of the flash stimulation questionnaire,
shown in Figure 9, shows that many subjects did not recognize the flash stimulation.
Previous research in [14] reported that the SSVEP-induced EEG is not a physiological
response to a stimulus but a change in the perception of that stimulus. Therefore, if the
flash stimulus cannot be recognized, the SSVEP may not be obtained accurately. For signals
G20–G45, the identification rate varied significantly by frequency: 70% on average at 30 Hz,
60% at 20 Hz, 40% at 15 Hz, 60% at 12 Hz, 70% at 10 Hz, 60% at 7.5 Hz, 65% at 6 Hz,
40% at 5 Hz, and 60% at 4 Hz. There are large differences in the algorithm accuracy rates,

Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 1045

11 of 18

and it is not possible to obtain a stable algorithm accuracy rate. With respect to 5 Hz, the
effect of double frequency may be considered, but with regard to the overall decrease
in algorithm accuracy rate, the difficulty of recognizing color changes due to green flash
stimuli is considered to have a major effect.
Based on the blue (240◦ ) results in Figure A5, the algorithm accuracy rate was 60%
or more for 6–15 Hz but is approximately 50% for a signal above 20 Hz, which is a fast
flash stimulus. In a previous report [15], blue and purple colors were reported to be
indistinguishable. As a visual stimulus signal, the instantaneous flicker signal takes a
long time to recognize the color change boundary; thus, a fast flash stimulus reduces
the algorithm accuracy rate. Therefore, the identification rate was low at high-speed
frequencies and high at low-speed frequencies. In addition, many answers that clearly
recognized flickering were given in B10–B45 of flicker rating (Figure 11). Recognition of
color changes is possible for any hue difference, and the difference in algorithm accuracy
rates due to hue change is small. From these results, it is believed that the accuracy of
blue varies depending on the frequency. From the results of the subjective questionnaire
of eye strain in Figure 11, it is clear that many subjects experienced asthenopia in signals
with strong color changes between B25 and B45. In summary, the blue signal cannot be
identified with high accuracy in high-speed signals; therefore, it is considered that it can be
used with low-speed signals as a stimulus signal to induce SSVEP.
In visual display terminal (VDT) work, it has been reported that the degree of fatigue
felt by the user changes depending on the display color, and this study confirmed that
the visual stimulus of SSVEP also affects the degree of fatigue in accordance with the
changing of the display color. Further, it was confirmed that the fatigue level of the
flash stimulus generated by the hue change was less than that of the conventional visual
stimulus generated by the brightness change. However, because there were some color
combinations for which the flash stimulus generated by color could not be experienced and
which reduced the algorithm accuracy rate of SSVEP, it is necessary to be aware of them.
The present study revealed that it is possible to acquire SSVEPs with color signals.
Therefore, it is possible to add color to the interface by using color stimuli as well as the
conventional black-and-white flash stimuli. By doing so, we believe that it is possible to
make BCI/BMI operate intuitively. In the future, it will be necessary to investigate the
algorithm accuracy rate and intuitive operability by mixing multiple color signals.
5. Conclusions
In this paper, we highlighted the risk of visual discomfort or photosensitive epilepsy in
response to intense light-induced flash stimuli and other visual stimuli used in noninvasive
SSVEP-type BCI. The flash stimulus signal used as a visual stimulus was proposed to
reduce visual discomfort by changing the color phase from a change in brightness to a
change in hue. A measurement experiment of SSVEP with different hue changes and
frequencies was performed to determine the flash stimulus signal with a similar degree of
accuracy after reducing visual discomfort compared to conventional methods. The results
are as follows.

•

•

For almost all hues and hue differences of the proposed visual stimuli, there was some
variation in the CFF changes, but all fatigue changes were between −1 and +1. The
only visual stimuli that were above this range were R45 and G5. For these two signals,
the results were also closer to 1 than to 2. Therefore, the proposed method causes less
fatigue than the conventional method, which has a CFF mean of +2.
As for the discrimination rate, we could confirm that the red visual stimuli were
slightly more accurate than the conventional method. For green and blue visual
stimuli, the accuracy depended on the hue difference, and the overall accuracy was
slightly lower in the G15–G45 and B25–B45 ranges than the conventional method.
However, for green and blue visual stimuli, the larger the hue difference, the much
lower the eye strain was, compared with red.

Figure A6. Subjective questionnaire results with blue flash stimuli: (a) Flicker; (b) Nausea; (c) Neck/back pain; (d) Blurred
vision; (e) Headache; (f) Dizziness; (g) Sore eyes; (h) Eye strain; (i) Irritated eyes; (j) Eye pain; (k) Slowed adjustment;
(l) Double vision; (m) Hot eyes. In all the graphs, the vertical axis represents the results of the questionnaire and the
horizontal axis the type of signal based on the hue. The shaded bar chart shows the upper and lower limits of the score.
Black bars indicate the mean score (flicker rating: 1 = none, 2 = slight, 3 = clear. measures of discomfort: 1 = none, 2 = slight,
3 = moderate, 4 = clear, 5 = severe.).
