ABSTRACT: This paper presents research on the perception of three-dimensional space in two-dimensional
media, and the methodology and results of a pilot study comparing the eye movements of architecture students when looking at different modalities of spatial representation. The results of this study show that student
designers’ physiological responses vary with different representation modalities.
1 INTRODUCTION
Architects design with varying modalities of representation, including sketches, drawings, physical
models, and digital models. These representations
may serve to assist architects in the development of
design concepts (Schön, 1992), or to communicate
design intentions to the client and/or future users.
The built work that results from a design process is a
new configuration of spaces and forms that humans
respond to both emotionally and physiologically.
But how does the built work compare with its earlier
representations? All modalities of spatial representation are abstractions of physical space and are therefore subject to interpretation. Since graphical representations are the most common form of
representation of space during designing it is important to know what the implications for the designer are in representing space in different graphical modalities. The research outlined in this paper is
part of a project which aims to relate physiological
responses in the embodied experience of the built
space with the responses evoked when looking at architectural representations. This research could have
substantial implications for our design process as architects and our pedagogical methods as architectural educators, in our challenge to bridge the divide
between concept and built work.
Little empirical research has been done on the
human physiological response to space and spatial
representations. This project is a cross-disciplinary
investigation involving researchers in architecture,
computer science and psychology. Our research
questions include: How veridical are these spatial
representations? Do physiological responses to modalities across a participant group demonstrate consistencies? Are there cultural differences in physio-

logical responses? Can physiological responses to
space as represented in various modalities of architectural representation be correlated with physiological responses to physically inhabited space?
For the purposes of this pilot study, we narrowed
our focus to pose the previously unexplored question: with the increasing application of computers in
architectural design, what is the effect of different
modes of digital representation on designers? With
this pilot project we aim to produce evidence-based
results about designers’ physiological responses as
they are exposed to two different modalities of spatial representation.
This pilot study utilized eye tracking to collect
physiological data, comparing responses to different
spatial representations. Through the collection of
eye tracking data, our aim was to test our preliminary hypothesis: that physiological responses vary
with representational modality. Building on the research paradigm of Scene Perception researchers
(Rensink, 2000) have been interested in how designers look at scenes. Experiments typically present the
scene on a computer screen, allowing for a high level of control over variables of the scene (Holmqvist
2011). Our pilot study follows this methodology.
From the analysis of the relationship between designers’ eye tracking data and different modalities of
representation – perspectival line drawing and photograph - designers’ responses to spatial representation will be presented and compared.
The remainder of the paper presents a brief background to architectural representation, spatial perception and eye tracking. This is followed by the research aim, significance and research design. From
an analysis of the eye-tracking data, results are presented and analysed, and broader impact discussed.

2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Architectural Representation
Architectural drawings are understood as referential
and non-autonomous; they are representations of architectural space and form. Plans, sections, and perspectival views typically follow discipline-specific
conventions for representation. These drawings may
specify the building, or they may depict it: defined
as notational or imaginative drawings by Sonit Bafna (2008). This distinction accounts for the drawingas-instruction, as well as the drawing-asprovocation. According to Bafna, “Richard Wollheim has argued that depictive seeing activates a
special mechanism that he termed ‘seeing-in’; faced
with such pictures one cannot help but see figures
within them despite knowing full well that they are
just marks on the surface.” Wollheim claims that we
simultaneously perceive the drawing as an object,
and the objects/spaces depicted within the drawing,
with a “two-fold sense of perception.” (Bafna 2008)
While the intent of the imaginative drawing is not to
evoke the experience of the building depicted, it is
meant to provoke a “mode of attention,” allowing
for an engagement with the representation that allows for multiple readings (Bafna 2008).
With photography, however, there tends to be an
assumption that it is an unbiased presentation of the
space. Yet understanding the content and spatial implications of a photograph is a learned ability, and
the photograph is, like a drawing, an abstraction of
the architectural space. While studies comparing different cultures have shown no difference in perceptual organization, “the interpretation of perceptual
material may differ considerably between two cultural groups.” (Weber 1995) For example, African
aborigines could not recognize anything in photographs they were shown. Two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional space requires interpretation which “relies on acquired visual conventions
that may be as arbitrary as linguistic conventions”
(Weber 1995). Photographs are authored and abstracted depictions of architectural space in the same
manner as drawings.
2.2 Spatial Perception
The ambiguity inherent in any architectural representation of space is a characteristic of spatial perception as well. Rudolf Arnheim emphasized the
relative nature of perception, describing perceptual
experience as being an aggregate of natural and
manmade objects. This aggregation forms a “spatial
framework” that causes visual percepts to “contain
more than what is given in the physical stimulus pattern” (Arnheim 1977). In other words, our experience of an architectural space is influenced as much
by the relationships and tension (or lack of tension)

between architectural elements as by those elements
themselves.
Michael Benedikt’s isovist theory helps designers
to evaluate visibility within or from a space from the
vantage point of an occupant, considering the physically bound space in comparison with what can be
visually perceived. An isovist is the volume of space
visible from a given point (Benedikt 1979). Oliva et
al. (2011) also studied the representation of the
shape of visual space. In their study they critique the
isovist theory of spatial perception for leaving out
other characteristics of space such as texture, material and color that contribute to the human perception of space. They also propose a model called the
‘spatial-envelope representation’, which describes
qualitatively the character and mood of a physical or
pictorial space, represented by its boundaries (e.g.,
walls, floor, ceiling, and lighting) stripped of movable elements (e.g., objects and furnishing). Then
they proposed a formal, computational approach to
the capture of the shape of space as it would be perceived from an observer’s vantage point (Oliva and
Torralba, 2001; Oliva and Torralba, 2006; Oliva et
al., 2011). The collection of properties describing a
space in view is referred to by the authors as the spatial-envelope representation. This distinction in the
characteristics that contribute to the human perception of space pertains to our research into representations of space that include or exclude some of those
characteristics.
2.3 Eye Tracking
Eye tracking data includes fixations and saccades,
based on movement of the fovea. The fovea represents less than 2 degrees of the visual field, so the
eye must move, or foveate, in order to take in detailed information (for example, in areas of an image
with complexity). When the eye stops to take in information, this is called a fixation. The rapid movement of the eye from one fixation to another is
called a saccade. During saccades, the eye is effectively blind: visual information obtained by the eye
occurs during fixations, thus making fixations the
most valuable data collected through eye tracking
(Holmqvist 2011).
As early as the 1930s, psychologists were interested in how the eye moves and fixates when focused on a work of art. Guy Buswell (1935), a psychologist who invented the first non-intrusive eye
tracker, found that the eyes do not follow edges, but
tend to scan and focus on central concave areas.
More recent studies confirm that fixations are likely
to occur in concave and enclosed areas of a figure,
rather than in what is perceived as negative space
(Weber 2005).

Yarbus (1967) was another pioneer in eye tracking research, who found that the eyes move in different paths when looking at an image depending on
the task the observer was asked to complete, Figure
1.

Figure 1. Eye tracking experiment by Alfred Yarbus in which
participants were given a series of tasks while looking at Ilya
Repin’s painting ‘An Unexpected Visitor’ (Yarbus 1967).

Kaufman and Richard (1969) measured eye fixation times in several pre-defined parts of figures: the
results show that the center of gravity is an attractor
as are the edges and corners. Gould and Peeples
(1970) suggest that a subject’s interpretation of a
figure does not affect eye movements, which means
that only “physical attributes” have influence on the
eye movements. Torralba et al.(2006) proposed visual attentional guidance through an experimental
search task. Results of their study suggest that the
context information plays an important role in object
detection and observation. They also suggest some
parts of the scene attract more attention than others.
While the relationship between eye movement
and perception of artworks has been investigated,
there has been very little study on the role of eye
movement in the perception of three-dimensional architectural space. One of the few studies on this topic was conducted by Weber, Choi, and Stark (2002)
in which they collected eye tracking data as participants were asked to look at three-dimensional models, or photographs of models, of architectural space.
These models were constructed to collect data on the
perception of the following architectural issues:
empty space; symmetry vs. asymmetry; left and
right reversed; obliquely-oriented elements; vista;
and foreground. The research focused on comparing
different arrangements of objects within a space, rather than different methods of representing the same
spatial configuration. Their results showed that, with
no priori model in a figure, the attention would fix-

ate at the center; while the foreground was common
for initial fixations, the eye did not typically scan the
edges of interior space or rectilinearly-oriented contours; the objects on the left attract more attentions
than the ones on the right. This confirmed the results
by Arnheim (Arnheim, 1985). The study also concluded that fixations did not vary significantly when
viewing the three-dimensional model compared with
a photograph of the model, with the exception of the
foreground, which attracted greater attention in the
3D model.
While these studies did not consider cultural
background in their data analysis, a 2005 study by
Chua et al. tested the hypothesis that those from
Western cultures (in this case, American participants) have a tendency to look at focal objects, while
those from Eastern cultures (in this case, Chinese
participants) tend to look more at context and background. This hypothesis was confirmed by their
study. The question of possible cultural differences
in eye movement also arose in our study.
3 PILOT STUDY
3.1 Research Design
To test the preliminary hypothesis that physiological
responses vary with representational modality, we
set up an experiment that measured eye movement
in response to spatial representations. In this experiment, 22 third and fourth year architecture students
at UNC-Charlotte (UNCC) and 30 third and fourth
year architecture students at Harbin Institute of
Technology (HIT) in China participated in this pilot
study.
During the experiment participants were asked to
complete demographic questions regarding their
gender, age and first language. They were required
to look at two images shown on a screen, Figure 2.

shows the setup at HIT in China; a similar setup was used in
Charlotte.

eye-tracking system (Gazepoint in USA and Tobii
studio in China). Each of the images was shown for
20 seconds with a few seconds for recalibration in
between them. Half of participants were first shown
R1 then R0. The other half was first shown R0 then
R1. After each image session there was a questionnaire session. Data collected included eye fixations
and saccades.
3.2 Results

Figure 3. Computer generated perspective drawing (labelled
R1 in the experiment).

Four metrics of eye movement data were captured
during the experiment: Time to First View (secs),
Time Viewed (%), Fixations and Average Revisits.
Time to First View measures how long it takes before a test participant fixates on an active AOI for
the first time. Time Viewed (%) is the percentage of
time viewed within an active AOI of the total viewing time – 20 seconds in this experiment. Fixations
measure the number of times the participant fixates
on an AOI. The Average Revisits measures the
number of visits within an active AOI. A visit is defined as the time interval between the first fixation
on the active AOI and the end of the last fixation
within the same active AOI where there have been
no fixations outside the AOI.
We identified 7 Areas of Interest (AOIs) in the
visual scene presented, Figure 5. Each AOI defines
an area that we wanted to gather data about. AOIs
defined the three doorways, the two wall surfaces
between them, the terminus of the corridor and the
ceiling.

The first image, labeled R1,Figure 3, is a computer
generated perspective drawing. The second image,
labeled R0, Figure 4, is a digitized photograph of the
same space when built. When they looked at the images, their eye-tracking data were recorded by an

differences in the results based on the order of
viewing of the images.
Table 1 shows the averages of the four metrics
for the data of the 7 AOIs in Image R1. Table 2
shows the average for each of the four metrics of eye
movement data of the 7 AOIs in Image R0.
We next determine whether there are statistically
significant differences between these two representation modalities. Table 3 presents the t-test results
of comparing Image R1 to Image R0. Statistically
significant differences are marked with an asterisk.
4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
4.1 Analysis of Results
The results of eye-tracking measurements are discussed initially in terms of the architecture students’
behavior when viewing each image. This is followed
by a discussion comparing the results of the eyetracking measurements for both images to determine
whether different modalities of digital representation
produce different physiological behavior in the
viewer.
The results in Tables 1 and 2 show how students
allocated their cognitive effort. For example, from
Table 1, we can see that the participants from both
UNCC and HIT have the longest time viewed in
AOI 1, largest average revisits in AOI 3 and the

most fixations on AOI 7, AOI 1 and AOI 3. The
least cognitive effort is allocated in AOI 2, AOI 5
and AOI 6.
There are two possible reasons for the longer time
spent viewing and fixating on AOI 1. Firstly, participants may have been attracted by the relatively
more complex spaces in a spatial figure - AOI 1 is
an open door through which they could see a glass
wall inside the room, as well as some spaces behind
the glass wall. When a designer is trying to understand the space, he/she will be attracted by this kind
of complexity. Also, fixations tend to occur within a
contained figure, rather than in the perceived negative space. While the white architectural volume sits
as a figure in the larger space depicted, its twodimensional representation causes the white wall to
be perceived as negative space. (The contour becomes part of the figure it encloses, rendering the
ground boundless.) Secondly, AOI 1 is located on
the left hand side of the image, and according to
study of Weber et al. (2002) and Arnheim (1985) the
left side of a composition attracts more attention
than the right. AOI 7 is the ceiling, which contains
some complex structure, therefore it attracts the attention of the participants.
The most revisited is AOI 3. This may be because
compared to AOI 1 it is relatively small and distant
so that participants need to revisit to try to understand the space. The least attention is directed at
AOIs 2, 5, and 6 possibly because they are relatively
simple areas.
The results in Table 3 indicate differences in three
of the four eye movement measurements. Time to
first view, time viewed and fixations were all statis-

tically significantly different when viewing the
computer-generated line drawing perspective compared to viewing the digital color photograph for
AOI 1, which is the first AOI to be viewed in the
digital photograph but is only the third AOI to be
viewed in the line drawing perspective. Interestingly, AOI-1 had the highest percentage of time viewed
for both modalities, whilst there was a lack of congruence for the other three measures.
The results from this study additionally imply the
following:
• Architectural students expend more cognitive
effort on the relative complex spatial representation areas, as well as the structurally
complex parts.
The complex spatial representation areas such as
AOI 1 naturally attract more attention probably because it needs more exploration to understand the
space. Certain features are more likely to attract eye
focus, for example, in a face figure the eye focus is
usually on “eye” and “mouth” (Gould and Peeples,
1970). In architecture, past research suggest that architects pay more attention to the spatial arrangement of various architectural elements (Weber et al.,
2002). The more complex spatial area such as AOI 1
contain multiple architectural elements: the extensive rooms behind the opening and the glass door.
Also the complex structural parts in the ceiling attracted more attention.
• The left-hand side parts in an image are likely to attract more attention.
Research on eye movement of static images has
shown that the left-hand side parts attract more attention than the right (Arnheim, 1985; Weber et al.,
2002). The present research confirms this claim that
human eyes tend to “rest” at the left hand side. The
possible reason may due to the visual pattern recognition and memory system of the brain. Further exploration of this phenomenon in spatial representations is needed.
• The edges of the interior space were not frequently scanned.

The most fixated areas are the complex spatial areas,
rather than the edges or corners of the interior space.
This result agrees with Weber et al. (2002)’s research on eye-tracking of interior space. However,
in Kaufman and Richard (1969)’s study, they state
that icons such as corners and edges are more likely
to attract attention, while the current study does not
confirm this claim.
• The center of gravity is not always the focus
of eye movement.
In the early eye tracking research, researchers found
that the eye fixation is always focused on the center
of gravity of a figure (Kaufman and Richard, 1969),
however in the current study, the center of the image
is not the focus on eye fixation, instead it is the relatively complex space. This indicates that the semantics of the image plays a role.
• Cultural background of the student did not
produce different results.
No significant difference was noted between the focal attention paid to AOIs by the American students
as compared with the Chinese students. A previous
study by Chua et al. (2005) confirmed the hypothesis that Americans fixated more on focal objects
while Chinese participants spent more time looking
at the context/background. This distinction was not
noted in our pilot study.
This paper has presented the results of a pilot study
comparing the physiological response of eye movement of architecture students when looking at different digital modalities of spatial representation. Results from the analysis of eye-tracking data suggest
that designers’ physiological responses vary with the
changes of digital representation. In order to make a
more comprehensive conclusion, a larger experiment
is needed in a future study. Future studies would include a broader demographic (comparing trained designers with non-designers) and a wider range of
representational modalities.

4.2 Next Steps
Our goal is to integrate and expand on research conducted in a number of fields, including architecture,
computer science, and psychology. Researchers in
these fields have investigated the processes by
which we perceive and understand space, by collecting and analyzing physiological data. We intend to
further our research by conducting a larger-scale
study with more participants, in which the sequence
of modalities can be varied, and in which we can test
the participants’ physiological responses to real
space in addition to representations.
The two key sources of relevant data for our next
study are eye trackers and EEG. As a counterpoint to
eye tracking as used in our pilot study, we are interested in additional physiological responses evoked
by a space and its representation, which can be
measured by EEG. Researchers have employed
these tools to track brain activity and stimulation
when viewing an image, as well as the emotional responses evoked by real-world spatial experiences.

Our methodology for the next experiment will focus on the emotional responses to these images as
indicated by EEG data, as an additional layer to the
eye tracking data. The Emotiv EPOC is a portable
EEG headset that collects brain wave data to identify
levels of cross-modal sensory processing, alertness/engagement, reflection, and engagement of
memory in gamma, beta, alpha and theta waves respectively. As a portable device, we will be able to
use it in subsequent studies in which the participants’ physiological responses are measured in an
embodied experience of a built space.
An anticipated outcome of a future large-scale
study would be the identification of modalities of
representation that most closely correlate with the
embodied architectural experience to predict how
spaces will affect the occupant’s physiological state.
As we improve our understanding of the relationship
between our representations of architecture space in
the design process and how that space as a built
work will ultimately be experienced, architectural
educators can work with students to represent their
design work in a more authentic way.
