A growing body of literature has emerged that focuses upon cognitive assessment of video game player
experience. Given the growing popularity of video gaming and the increasing literature on cognitive
aspects of video gamers, there is a growing need for novel approaches to assessment of the cognitive
processes that occur while persons are immersed in video games. In this study, we assessed various
stimulus modalities and gaming events using an off-the-shelf EEG devise. A signiﬁcant difference was
found among different stimulus modalities with increasingly difﬁcult cognitive demands. Speciﬁcally,
beta and gamma power were signiﬁcantly increased during high intensity events when compared to
low intensity gaming events. Our ﬁndings suggest that the Emotiv EEG can be used to differentiate
between varying stimulus modalities and accompanying cognitive processes.

1. Introduction
Video games represent an immersive activity that is rapidly
increasing in popularity. According to the Entertainment Software
Association [1], 72% of the general population and 97% of teenagers
(between the ages of 12 and 17) reported regular playing of video
games. Further, video games have been found to be played more
frequently and in more locations [2]. A growing body of literature
has emerged that focuses upon assessment of video game player
cognition [3–6]. Given the growing popularity of video gaming
and the increasing literature on cognitive aspects of video gamers,
a growing need is for novel approaches to assessment of cognitive
processes occurring while persons are immersed in video game
experiences.
1.1. Current approaches to assessment
Assessment of the impact of the video game immersion on the
user is often difﬁcult. Numerous studies exclusively employ subjective response questionnaires to draw conclusions about what
the participant is experiencing while immersed in virtual environments [7–10]. Self-report data, when used in isolation, are highly

susceptible to inﬂuences outside the participant’s own targeted
attitudes [11]. The item’s wording, context, and format are all factors that may affect self-report responses [12]. Further, questioning
the player while they are playing the video game affects their
experience during the video game [13]. While asking them after
playing the game can lead to missed information and/or false information [14]. Knowledge of the user-state during exposure to the
video game is imperative for development and assessment of video
game design [15]. Individuals will invariably have different reactions to a given video game, and without an assessment tool that
can be employed online, the researcher will experience difﬁculties
in identifying the causes of these differences, which may lead to a
loss of experimental control of the research paradigm.
1.2. Psychophysiological assessment of video game experience
Psychophysiological metrics provide a number of advantages
over self-report for enhanced assessment of video game experience
[16,17]. The psychophysiological signal is continuously available,
whereas behavioral or self-report data may be detached from the
gaming experience and presented intermittently [18]. The continuous nature of psychophysiological signals is important for several
reasons. First, it allows for greater understanding of how any stimulus in the gaming environment impacted the gamer, not only those
targeted for producing behavioral responses [19]. It also follows that
a break in the gamer’s sense of presence is not necessary, because
the signal is measured continuously and noninvasively, and as
Slater et al. [20] report, it is even possible that psychophysiological

2

measures can be used to uncover stimuli in the gaming environment that cause a break in presence. It is also important to note that
psychophysiological responses can be made without the gamer’s
conscious awareness, creating an objective measure of the gamer’s
state, which can include measures of cognitive workload [21–23],
varying stress levels [24,25], task engagement [26,27], and arousal
[28–30] among others. Additionally, multiple channels of
psychophysiological data can be gleaned from various sensors continuously, which further increase experimental control by providing
a combination of measures, so that one measure alone is not the sole
basis for design decisions [31].

Advance Neuro Technology (ANT) acquisition system during a
run with the P300 speller system. Although the Emotiv headset
was not found to be as accurate as the ANT system (a medical
grade device), it was able to capture EEG signal at a successful level
that was deemed adequate for games. With the beneﬁt of being
noninvasive to the wearer, it is a tool that is practical for use by
game developers.
The current study aimed to assess the impact of various stimulus modalities on participants using the Emotiv EEG. Speciﬁcally,
we aimed to (1) assess the impact of various stimulus modalities
on participants; and (2) isolate video game events (e.g., death of
a character) using the collected EEG data from the Emotiv Headset.

1.3. EEG to isolate speciﬁc game events
Recent approaches to psychophysiological computing have
applied psychophysiological modeling to interactive video games
[32]. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a means of accessing
and recording neural activity, allowing a computer to retrieve and
analyze information from the brainwave patterns produced by
thought. EEG has been shown to have the capability to measure
player experience [33,34]. Beta rhythm has been shown to increase
with attention and vigilance in general [35,36] and during video
game play speciﬁcally [37]. Salmin and Ravaja [37] used EEG to
isolate speciﬁc game events from the EEG data. Using Super
Monkey Ball 2 as their test platform they were able to detect
changes in the brain wave bands as different event occurred during
game play. Nacke et al. [38] also showed that EEG data could be
used to determine player experience across entire level designs.
Using a Half Life 2 mod they measured EEG across three different
levels of designed to induce boredom, immersion, and ﬂow. The
data showed that there were increased levels of brain wave activity
as the player moved across the levels. Further, gamma has been
found to be involved in a host of other cognitive processes:
attention, arousal, object recognition, and top-down modulation
of sensory processes [39]. Beta activity, gamma activity and
perceived action possibilities have been found in studies of virtual
gaming environments [40,41].
Whilst there are many beneﬁcial EEG applications, much of this
technology has yet to leave the research lab. One large factor of this
is due to the EEG devices. The majority of research and medical
EEG devices are expensive, bulky, and require a number of skilled
technicians. As technology progresses, the cost and size will
continue to decrease. Recently some inexpensive consumer-grade
devices have become available. An example of this is the Emotiv
EPOC, a compact, wireless headset that requires comparatively little effort to set up and allows much greater ﬂexibility and mobility
than traditional EEG. The EPOC was aimed at the gaming market,
and is not classiﬁed as a medical device, though a few researchers
have since adopted it for a variety of applications [42–44]. Using
the EPOC, researchers can detect facial movements, emotional
states, and imagined motor movement.
A number of researchers have used the Emotiv EEG recordings
for assessment of cognitive processes. Researchers have investigated different EEG processing algorithms to assess classiﬁcation
of shapes being thought about [45], detection of hand movement
intentions on the same side of the brain as the hand [46], classiﬁcation of positive and negative emotion elicited by pictures [47–49],
and evaluation of cognitive workload [50].
It is important to note that some have questioned ‘‘what’’ the
Emotiv EEG is actually measuring [51], and it is known that the
Emotiv sensors detect EMG along with EEG data. Nevertheless,
the system has been found to work well for detecting events when
the participant is told to picture various stimuli [45,52]. Although
the Emotiv EEG does not have the ﬁdelity of a laboratory EEG it still
offers the ability to provide a gamer’s brain wave signature.
Duvinage et al. [53] compared the Emotiv headset to the

2. Methods
2.1. Participants
EEG data was collected from 30 healthy participants (66% female,
mean age = 20.87, range 18–43). Participants were recruited from
undergraduate graduate schools; education levels ranged from 13
to 20 years. Ethnicity was as follows: Caucasian (n = 20), African
American (n = 1), Hispanic (n = 4), Native American (n = 1), and
Asian Paciﬁc (n = 4). Participants reported they used a computer at
least once every day with 30% saying they used the computer several times a day. 66% participants rated themselves as experienced,
27% rated themselves as somewhat experienced, and 7% rated
themselves as very experienced when ranking their computer
competency. Homogeneity of the sample was found in that there
were no signiﬁcant differences among participants relative to age,
education, ethnicity, sex, and self-reported symptoms of depression. Strict exclusion criteria were enforced to minimize possible
confounding effects of comorbid factors known to adversely impact
cognition, including psychiatric conditions (e.g., mental retardation,
psychotic disorders, diagnosed learning disabilities, attention
deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder, and bipolar disorders, as well as substance-related disorders within 2 years of evaluation) and neurologic conditions (e.g., seizure disorders, closed head injuries with loss
of consciousness greater than 15 min, and neoplastic diseases). All
participants were right handed and had at least average computer
skills. Game playing skills ranged from casual cell phone games to
playing every day on a personal computer or a game console. The
participants received class credit for their participation in the study.
2.2. Apparatus
2.2.1. Super Meat Boy
Super Meat Boy [54] is a platform game in which players control a small, dark red, cube-shaped character named Meat Boy.
The participant played a cube of meat jumping around the level
to avoid saw blades to reach their goal of rescuing bandage girl.
This game requires the minimum amount of keys to play (arrow
keys and space bar) thus making it easy for any level of gamer to
achieve success. Major events in the game include successfully
completing a level and dying. Dying occurs from running into spinning saw blades or falling into ﬁre. As the player progresses
through the game the levels get increasingly difﬁcult by adding
more saw blades and large jumps. Each level is timed as a goal of
the game is to get through each level as fast as possible. The core
gameplay requires ﬁne control and split-second timing [55].
Primary game events used for this study included: (1) Death
events; and (2) ‘‘General Game Play’’. The ‘‘Death events’’ occurred
when the participant’s character died. Although there are a number
of possible ways for a character to die in a game (e.g., the character
gets sliced to pieces, or falls into acid, or gets skewered on needles),
we sampled from death events related to the character falling into

T. McMahan et al. / Entertainment Computing 7 (2015) 1–6

acid. The ‘‘General Game Play’’ was differentiated from ‘‘Death
events’’ in that general game play was sampled during periods in
which the player had not experienced any death events for 1 min
before or after ‘‘General Game Play’’ sampling.
2.2.2. Two-Picture Cognitive Task
Participants were shown a pair of color pictures of a landscape,
and were given the evaluative task of identifying any differences
between the pair. Unknown to the participants, the pictures were
identical.
2.2.3. Game Experience Survey
Participants answered a series of questions assessing their
prior videogame experience and other personal characteristics.
Participants were asked to report the number of hours they spent
playing video games on their cell phones (M = 3.47), playing games
on their computer (M = 3.47), and playing games on their game
console (M = 2.3). 20% of the participants reported playing video
games more than 20 h per week. The participants were also asked
if they would classify themselves as ‘‘gamers’’, 33% responded as
being part of this category.
2.2.4. Emotiv EPOC EEG
This Emotiv EEG headset has 14 electrodes (saline sensors)
locating at AF3, AF4, F3, F4, F7, F8, FC5, FC6, P7, P8, T7, T8, O1, O2
(see Fig. 1) and two additional sensors that serve as CMS/DRL
reference channels (one for the left and the other for the right
hemisphere of the head). The Emotiv EEG’s 14 data channels are
spatially organized using the International 10–20 system. The
Emotiv EPOC headset does not require a moistened cap to improve
conduction. The sampling rate is 128 Hz, the bandwidth is
0.2–45 Hz, and the digital notch ﬁlters are at 50 Hz and 60 Hz.
2.3. Procedure
Upon arriving at the testing ofﬁce, the participants were given
an informed consent to read and sign. Included in the informed
consent was a waiver to record the participant during the study.
The participants were then seated in a comfortable chair and given
a keyboard and mouse to complete a questionnaire about
computer and game experience. For the actual assessment, each
participant played the game in the same room location. The game
was displayed on a Samsung 60 in. plasma screen. The participants
sat in a chair that has a built in keyboard tray, along with a speaker

system and USB port around head level to minimize the distance
between the Emotiv headset and the receiver/transmitter. While
the participant played the game the lights were turned off to help
immerse the player into the game and reduce glare from the overhead lights. The experimenter combed the participants on the left,
mid-line, and right sides of their scalp ﬁrmly in order to reduce
electrode impedances [56]. After the relevant areas on the face
and mastoids had been cleaned, the Emotiv EEG headset was positioned on the participant’s head. The examiner veriﬁed impedances
in connections between each electrode and the participant’s scalp.
To establish base line for each participant a video was played
and were told ‘‘to relax and try not to think about anything’’. In
the video the screen was blank for 2:00 min to establish a minimum brain wave activity. Next, the participant completed two
tasks: the Two Picture Cognitive Task and Super Meat Boy task.
Task presentation order was counter-balanced across participants.
After the initial task (either Two Picture Cognitive Task or Super
Meat Boy) the participant was presented with 1:30 s of blank
screen viewing to allow the participant to return to a steady state.
During the Two-Picture Cognitive Task they compared two pictures to determine the difference between them. This allowed for
the establishment of a brain wave signature for basic cognitive processing. During the Super Meat Boy Task the researcher aided the
participant with the ﬁrst few levels to allow the player to become
acquainted with the rules and game controls. Next, participants
were informed that they would play Super Meat Boy for 15 min
and that they were to advance as far as they could in the game.
Each participant’s game play was captured in 1080p HD
(60 frames per second) using a Hauppauge video capturing device
allowing the game play to be synced the EEG data. Each participant
was also recorded using a Logitech 9000 HD webcam to help isolate events (facial or body movements) that may affect the EEG
data. EEG data and video data were recorded on the same computer with all non-essential programs closed. Using OpenViBE drift
correction, a 128 Hz sample rate was achieved minimizing any
syncing issues between the EEG data and the video recording of
game play. Syncing all video recordings with EEG recording software involved the use of screen captures before and after every
section of the study (baseline video and game play). Each screen
shot produced a time stamp for EEG data and video to establish
the location of the start and end of each section. The screen shots
were saved to reference later during the data analysis phase.
2.4. Data analytics
All data were analyzed using SAS version 9.1. Descriptive statistics were calculated for participant demographics and for EEG
results. Missing data were imputed by either mean substitution
or last case carried forward.
The Emotiv Epoc headset was used to capture the EEG data from
each participant. Emotiv TestBench and OpenViBE were used to
capture the raw EEG output from the headset. The EEG data was
segmented into epochs that started 100 ms before the onset of
each stimulus (0 ms), and ended 750 ms after the onset of the same
stimulus. Epochs were calculated for 4 different modalities: (1)
baseline—staring at a blank screen; (2) Two-Picture Cognitive
Task; (3) General Game Play; and (4) Death events.
Artifacts such as blinking, head movements, or body movement
can cause unwanted data in EEG data. Most EEG analysis requires
removal of these artifacts to help identify medical issues. However
this is not necessarily a detrimental issue when using for game
play analysis. These types of artifacts are common in everyday
game play [57,58]. These artifacts can actually be used for further
analysis as body movement or other movement can signify
engagement [59]. The EEG artefact data was annotated as artefact
where visually noticeable deﬂection in the EEG was observed at the

4

T. McMahan et al. / Entertainment Computing 7 (2015) 1–6

times that participants performed movements. Artifacts related to
eye blinks and other muscle movements in addition to physical
movements of the sensors themselves were removed before the
EEG traces were processed. The Emotiv SDK automatically detects
and records eye blinks. Given that muscle contraction and control
are generally governed outside of the frequency range of interest
[60], we were able to use frequency band limiting procedures such
as low-pass, high-pass and notch ﬁlters to adequately remove
these signal components. As Anderson et al. [61] describe, after
removing EEG artifacts the researcher may assess whether the
energy densities of the alpha or theta frequency bands are changed
by more than 20% of their original values. If so, the trial should be
removed from all further analysis. In this study, we did not need to
throw out any of the trials due to excessive signal degradation
from movement or excessive change in spectral densities.
The power estimates (lV2) were found using a fast Fourier
transform (FFT) and a 1 s Hamming window with no overlap for
Delta (1–4 Hz), Theta (4–7 Hz), Alpha (7–13 Hz), Beta (13–25 Hz)
and Gamma (25–43 Hz) for all 14 sensor location on the Emotiv
headset. In typically EEG studies, the number of channels (e.g.,
32, 64, 128, or 256 EEG channels) ranges from 32 channels (for routine exams) up to 256 channels (for source estimation) and the systems are able to sample at up to 1000 Hz. Given that the Emotiv
has only 14 channels and the data sample rate is only 128 Hz,
the average was calculated across all 14 sensors to obtain a global
average for each frequency band. Following Anderson et al. [50] the
baseline and stimulus signals were transformed to determine the
power change and frequency shift induced by the task. These values are used to calculate the cognitive processing experienced at
each of the 14 sensors for a given task. The spatial averaging of
the 14 values gives a single measurement for analysis. Finally the
data was normalized with the natural logarithm (ln).

2.5. Results
We completed repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)
assessments on the following modalities: (1) Two Picture Cognitive
Task; (2) simple game play (General Game Play) using Super Meat
Boy; and (3) complex game events (e.g., Death) using Super Meat
Boy. Given that epochs were 0.85 s, 3.5 Hz is the lowest frequency
that can be estimated with some reliability, since it still contains 3
periods. As a result, estimates of power for the delta and theta band
were not included because of their low reliability (see Table 1).
Results from the repeated measures ANOVA using modalities as a
within-subject factor for dependent variables beta (13–25 Hz),
and gamma (25–43 Hz; ln[lV2]) revealed a signiﬁcant difference
for beta (F(2, 28) = 6.213, p = .004, partial eta2 = .18), and gamma
(F(2, 28) = 8.875, p = .0001, partial eta2 == .23) power estimates
was found during the different modalities.
Follow-up tests of repeated within-subject contrasts revealed
that modalities had differing impacts on power estimates. Beta
power was signiﬁcantly increased during the Death Event in comparison with the Two-Picture Cognitive Task (t(1, 29) = 2.97,
p < .006; see Fig. 2). Gamma power was also signiﬁcantly
increased during the Death Event in comparison with the
Two-Picture Cognitive Task (t(1, 29) = 2.99, p < .006; see Fig. 3).
Interestingly, there were no signiﬁcant difference between
General Game Play and the Two-Picture Cognitive Task.
Comparison of low intensity (General Game Play) gaming events
with high intensity (e.g., Death events) using repeated withinsubject contrasts revealed that beta power was signiﬁcantly increased
during the Death Event in comparison with the General Game Play
(t(1,29) = 2.536, p = .01; see Fig. 2). Further, gamma power was also
signiﬁcantly increased during the Death Event in comparison with
the General Game Play (t(1,29) = 3.372, p = .002; see Fig. 3).

3. Discussion
3.1. General overview of ﬁndings
Our goal was to assess various cognitive tasks within gaming
environments using an off-the-shelf EEG devise. We also aimed
to isolate video game events (e.g., death of a character) using the
collected EEG data from the Emotiv Headset. The primary results
were: (a) a signiﬁcant difference was found among different gaming modalities (Two-Picture Cognitive Task; General Game Play;
Death events) for beta and gamma; (b) gaming modalities had differing impacts on power estimates, with beta and gamma power
being signiﬁcantly increased during the Death Event in comparison
with the Two-Picture Cognitive Task; and (c) Comparison of low
intensity (General Game Play) gaming events with high intensity
(e.g., Death events) revealed that beta and gamma power were signiﬁcantly increased during the Death Event in comparison with the
General Game Play. Interestingly, there were no signiﬁcant difference between General Game Play and the Two-Picture Cognitive
Task.
3.2. Gaming modalities had differing impacts on power estimates
We found that modality type had differing impacts on power
estimates. Beta power was signiﬁcantly increased during the
Death Event in comparison with the Two-Picture Cognitive Task.
Activity in the beta range is known to be important for attention
and motor processing [62]. Given that Death Events require
increased attention, these results are not surprising. Beta rhythm
has been shown to increase with attention and vigilance in general
[35,36] and during video game play speciﬁcally [37]. For example,
Salminen and Ravaja [37] found that different events in the platform game Super Monkey Ball 2 evoked oscillatory responses in
beta. Likewise, gamma power was signiﬁcantly increased during
the Death Event in comparison with the Two-Picture Cognitive

that game impact can be measured via EEG [38,64,37,65]. A further
limitation is that we only compared two tasks in this study; and
only one of these tasks was a video game. Future studies will be
needed to expand these results into methodological approaches
to quantifying videogame based EEG assessment in general and
Emotiv-based EEG assessment of various games in particular.
4. Conclusions

Fig. 3. EEG gamma power mean values ln[lV2] for each modality that was tested.

Task. Gamma oscillations have been found to be signiﬁcantly
associated with the brain’s ability to integrate various aspects of
a stimulus into a coherent whole. Further, gamma has been found
to be involved in a host of other cognitive processes: attention,
arousal, object recognition, and top-down modulation of sensory
processes [39]. The increased beta and gamma between Death
events and the Two-Picture Cognitive Task reﬂect ﬁndings in the
literature that suggest a link between EEG beta activity, gamma
activity and perceived action possibilities in a virtual gaming
environment [40,41].
Interestingly, there were no signiﬁcant difference between
General Game Play and the Two-Picture Cognitive Task. We believe
that this may reﬂect a lack of differences in the cognitive resources
needed for the two tasks. The cognitive processes needed for the
Two-Picture Cognitive Task involve those needed for staring at
two pictures and performing a visual search for any differences.
This is a low arousal and simple cognitive search task. Likewise,
General Game Play is low in arousal and requires the participant
to simply scan the viewable play area for safe areas to jump.
Changes in beta and gamma occur when the participant moves from
a low intensity search process to a high threat and high intensity
Death event.
Comparison of low intensity (General Game Play) gaming
events with high intensity (e.g., Death events) using repeated
within-subject contrasts revealed that beta and gamma were signiﬁcantly increased during the Death Event in comparison with
the General Game Play. As mentioned above, the beta and gamma
results are consistent with expectation.
3.3. Limitations and future directions
Our ﬁndings should be understood in the context of some limitations. These ﬁndings are based on a fairly small sample size. As a
necessary next step, the reliability and validity of the Emotiv EEG
needs to be established using a larger sample of participants to
ensure that the current ﬁndings are not an anomaly due to sample
size. Further, ﬁndings need further validation through straightforward comparison of Emotiv EEG results with those of standard
laboratory-based EEG assessment technology. It is important to
note, however, that the Emotiv has been favorably compared to a
laboratory-based research EEG system (Neuroscan). Badcock
et al. [63] found that the Emotiv EEG system can prove a valid
alternative to laboratory ERP systems for recording reliable late
auditory ERPs over the frontal cortices. While we found some
interesting results, it is important to emphasize that these are very
preliminary there are not currently well-established methodologies for examining the impact of game levels on players.
Nevertheless, there is an increasing body of literature suggesting

We have presented ﬁndings from a study aimed at assessing the
impact of various stimulus modalities on participants using the
Emotiv EEG. We also aimed to isolate video game events
(e.g., death of a character) using the collected EEG data from the
Emotiv Headset. As our results show we were able to ﬁnd signiﬁcant difference in the Beta and Gamma bands between the different modalities (Two-Picture Cognitive Task; General Game Play;
Death Events) of game play. We also saw an increase in the power
estimates during high intensity game play (e.g., death event) when
compared to low intensity general game play. Our ﬁndings suggest
that the Emotiv EEG can be used to assess differences in frequency
bands when persons are experiencing various stimulus modalities
using off-the-shelf EEG-based gaming technology. It is important
to note that these ﬁndings are based on a fairly small sample size
and future studies will be needed to expand these results into
methodological approaches to quantifying videogame based EEG
assessment in general and Emotiv-based EEG assessment of various games in particular. Nevertheless, these results support the
idea that the Emotiv EPOC headset is a low-cost tool that has the
potential to assess player experience during game play.
