Abstract: Due to technological progress in forestry, seedlings with covered root systems—especially
those grown in container nurseries—have become increasingly important in forest nursery production.
One the trees that is most commonly grown this way is the common oak (Quercus robur L.). For an
acorn to be sown in a container, it is necessary to remove its upper part during mechanical scarification,
and evaluate its sowing suitability. At present, this is mainly done manually and by visual assessment.
The low effectiveness of this method of acorn preparation has encouraged a search for unconventional
solutions. One of them is the use of an automated device that consists of a computer vision-based
module. For economic reasons related to the cost of growing seedlings in container nurseries,
it is beneficial to minimize the contribution of unhealthy seeds. The maximum accuracy, which
is understood as the number of correct seed diagnoses relative to the total number of seeds being
assessed, was adopted as a criterion for choosing a separation threshold. According to the method
proposed, the intensity and red components of the images of scarified acorns facilitated the best
results in terms of the materials examined during the experiment. On average, a 10% inaccuracy of
separation was observed. A secondary outcome of the presented research is an evaluation of the
ergonomic parameters of the user interface that is attached to the unit controlling the device when it
is running in its autonomous operation mode.

1. Introduction
Common oak (Quercus robur L.) is one of the main forest-forming species, occurring in almost
the entire Europe: from the Iberian Peninsula in the west to the foothills of the Ural Mountains in the
east, and from the Scandinavian Peninsula in the north to the Balkan Peninsula and the Apennine
Peninsula in the south [1–3]. Forest nursery staff in both in Poland and in Europe artificially regenerate

this species, whereas natural regeneration is limited to certain areas, and even then only in the
most fertile years [4]. The direct sowing of acorns is rarely performed [5]. Due to technological
progress in the forestry industry, seedlings with covered root systems have grown in importance
in forest nursery production, especially those grown in container nurseries. In sustainable forest
management, such seedlings are mainly used in areas that have been subject to strong anthropopressure
and degraded, but due to their shortened production period, they are increasingly being used for
regeneration in post-disaster stands and for afforestation under difficult soil and climatic conditions,
e.g., post-fire cultivation areas, abandoned agricultural areas, and post-mining excavations [6].
The most important factors influencing the quality of seedlings produced in container nurseries
include an optimally mixed and compacted culture substrate [7]. Apart from stabilizing the seedlings,
the culture substrate must provide water, oxygen, nutrients, and minerals. In order to obtain a
suitable substrate for the container production of seedlings, organic and inorganic ingredients (peat,
compost, mycorrhizal fungus, perlite, vermiculite, dolomite, sand, pumice stone, rock wool, and others)
are mixed together [8–10]. Another important factor influencing the success of the production of
seedlings in a clod of soil is the quality of sowing material and the depth of sowing [11]. Seedling
producers should have at their disposal sowing material that is not only of high genetic value,
i.e., representing the full genetic diversity of the ecosystem, but also appropriately sorted, cleaned,
and possibly equal as to its mass or size [12,13]. This is also enforced by economic calculations
regarding the production of seedlings, particularly of those vaccinated with mycorrhizal fungi [14,15].
Modern forest nursery technologies and techniques should therefore be based on very high-quality
seeds, each of which could produce a seedling with the expected morphological parameters. This is
particularly important in container nurseries due to the optimization of the production area: only one
seed should be sown in one container cell.
Decades-long research on the collection of acorns has shown that an abundant acorn yield usually
occurs every five to seven years in Poland, while good seed seasons might occur more frequently
(once every three years) or less frequently (once every nine years) [16,17]. In a mild climate (in Western
Europe), seed years occur more frequently (every two to five years). On the national scale, the main
source of oak seeds are managed seed stands. In the case of high yields, the demand for seeds amounts
to approximately 600,000 kg, which presents a large logistical problem concerning the preparation
of such large quantities of seeds. The seeds of common oak fall into the “recalcitrant” category,
and therefore, in order to preserve their longevity, they require constant maintenance of their natural
humidity and thus cannot be frozen for the purpose of long-term storage. Since acorns quickly lose their
viability, their storage is practically limited to two to three years. The worse the quality of seeds at the
beginning of storage, the sooner they age. This justifies the importance of seed separation, the purpose
of which is to clean the seeds and separate the mature, properly developed ones from the immature or
damaged ones. The very collection of larger-size acorns is a selection process. However, it is important
to remember that trees growing in the same stand may produce seeds that are very different in their
physical characteristics. The age of the tree significantly influences the newly-produced seeds’: critical
velocity of flying, thickness, width, angle of external friction, shape, and density. Seeds from old
trees are often smaller than those from young trees that are entering the seed production stage [18,19].
Due to the need for the protection and preservation of genetic diversity, large and heavy seeds as well
as small and light ones should be of equal importance. The gradual rejection of small seeds, which is
commonly done when using classical separation methods, may result in eliminating the seeds of old
trees from the yield, i.e., the trees that are the most likely of native character, and best suited to given
habitat conditions [20].
The selection of seeds with the expected biological characteristics is commonly done using their
correlations with physical properties [21]. Those properties, called distribution features, include:
aerodynamic features, geometric features, density, friction coefficient, surface texture, and mechanical,
electrical, and optical properties. It should be noted that the seeds are alive all of the time, so separation
processes must not cause their mechanical damage and interfere with their physiological or biochemical

Sustainability 2017, 9, 2370

processes [22]. Previous research on common oak seeds showed that only their density, and to a very
limited extent, their mass, aerodynamic and mechanical properties, depend on their health. However,
it is not possible to separate only healthy seeds in a seed lot; they may only be separated together
with slightly unhealthy seeds. An acorn’s size—which is characterized by linear dimensions or
volume—as well as its frictional properties, are not distributive features, as the mummification process
affects almost all of the fractions of acorns. Acorn shape is a similar case: both among healthy acorns as
well as unhealthy and slightly unhealthy ones, there are similar numbers of slender seeds (a rotational
ellipsoid) and bulky (spherical) ones [13,23]. Acorn damage may occur even before harvest, as well
as during harvest, and treatment and may be caused by bacteria, fungi, and insects. In some cases,
the level of damage reaches is significant [24,25].
The low effectiveness of acorn separation when using the classical methods has prompted a
search for unconventional solutions [26]. These include optical properties, in the classical sense,
such as color and intensity [19,27]. The pre-sowing preparation of oak seeds includes scarification,
i.e., cutting off 20–30% of the distal part of the acorn. It is followed by a visual assessment of the
health of the seed [28]. Thanks to this pre-sowing rejection of necrotic seeds, it is possible to increase
the field germination ability by approximately 30% [29]. An analysis of the color and topography of
mummification changes visualized in cotyledons, which are uncovered during scarification, could thus
be regarded as a distributive feature in both manual and automated scarification procedures.
In the design process of the scarification device, several demands have been mitigated. The apparatus
is expected to operate in an automated way with assumed accuracy, and require only periodic or
emergency assistance from an operator. In this study, we propose and evaluate the performance
of the distributive feature; we also examine the ergonomic properties of the touch control panel,
which provides a graphical user interface to the operator and embodies the human–machine interface.
Therefore, this study is also related to the activity of the human senses, brain, and mind.
Apart from the typically cognitive activities, the aims of cognitive science include the modeling
and simulation of cognitive human activities, as well as areas such as language, learning, perception,
thinking, consciousness, decision-making, etc. Juliszewski et al. [30] have examined several on-board
computer interfaces in agricultural machinery and tractors, as well as procedures for activating selected
functions, and they often observed a lack of logical links between them in tractors and machines made
by different manufacturers. An additional difficulty in the configuration of such a system is the
ambiguity of methods of mental stress measurement, which, despite numerous techniques, does not
provide satisfactory results. This is complicated further by problems of euthyphronics not yet being
widespread. One of the techniques, which can address the ambiguity problem, is a measurement of
the response of an individual’s central nervous system, as expressed by the heart rate. Among other
approaches, video plethysmography is currently recognized as a promising non-invasive heart rate
measurement method that is advantageous for the ubiquitous monitoring of humans in natural work
or living conditions [31]. According to Złowodzki et al. [32], the information load is not only due
to its quantity, but also to the necessity of knowing many sequences and the proper decoding of
information. In the ergonomic man–machine system, the carrier of this message is a signal from a
device designed for this particular purpose: the so-called signaling device. Its purpose is to provide
information to the operator in an understandable way. The operator who uses the machine should
see the abnormal condition of its operation (signaled e.g., by a LED–Light-Emitting Diode) relatively
quickly, and then be able to identify the sub-normal state of the machine (indicated by a green LED,
as well as its above-normal state (indicated e.g., by a red LED). It is only after identifying and decoding
the information based on specific knowledge that the operator takes a decision to change particular
settings of the machine. It should be emphasized that the wrong decision and the possible failure
of the equipment have tangible financial consequences, as the prices of machinery currently used in
agriculture often exceed a quarter million PLN (pol. Nowy Polski Złoty- polish currency).
In spite of the tremendous potential of the human brain, the following limitation is important
here [33]: the reduction of the information stream ranges from 3,000,000 bits per second (flow through

the nervous system) to 16 bits/s (the stream of information that is consciously perceived) and
0.7 bits/s (the stream of information that is permanently remembered). Tadeusiewicz [34] states
that the information capacity of the sensory channels can be estimated as follows: sight 100 Mb/s,
touch 1 Mb/s, hearing 15 Kb/s, smell 1 Kb/s, taste 100 bit/s. It should be noted that, according to
Hagerer and Köbsell [35], during the combine harvesting of cereals lying on the ground, the average
amount of information was 1.30 bit/s, and the maximum amount of information was 8.82 bit/s.

Healthy seeds constitute 49% in the training set, and 40% in the test set. The presented values
show that, according to the method adopted, the red component R and the image brightness V make
it possible to obtain the best recognition in both the test set and the training set. In these cases,
the occurrence of high accuracy is also associated with high precision, which translates into a small
discrepancy between the number of seeds assessed as healthy and those that actually germinated.
This difference is 9% for the training set, and 11% for the test set.
3.2. Assessment of the Usefulness of Automatic Recognition
The figures in Table 1 reflect the degree of utilization of the sowing material under assessment.
The degree of utilization of those container cells into which the seeds qualified as healthy were sown is
equal to the precision of recognition, and amounts to 83% for the training set and 76% for the test set.
It may therefore be concluded that the use of the visual assessment of seed quality allowed—for the
analyzed seed sample—for increasing the utilization of the nursery’s stock by approximately 10%
as compared with the method of sowing all of the seeds without their analysis after scarification.
Further increase in the utilization of containers using the presented sorting method is possible after
the threshold has been increased; however, this is connected with rejecting a larger number of seeds.
The presented results confirm that the performance of vision-based classification of scarified
acorns is suitable for controlling the acorn separation unit. The accuracy is comparable with—and in
some cases outperforms—the recognition of experienced employees [29]. This makes an image of a
section of scarified acorn a promising distributive feature for the automated assessment of acorns with
respect to their health.
3.3. Implementation of the Acorn Separation Unit
Recognition is performed by a computer vision system that has been designed for the recognition
of sections of acorns. Following recognition, the gripper and the separation unit separate the seeds.
The gripper is attached to a rotating arm that is triggered by the control unit of the automatic device.
An acorn being assessed is fixed by the fingers of the gripper, which move it in a rotary motion over
the camera (Figure 5a,b) and further, to the separation unit (Figure 6). The reception baskets are fixed
in a single handle, which is attached to a frame. Once released by the fingers of the gripper above
the appropriate reception basket, the seed falls through the funnel into the container. The place of
the gripper release is automatically controlled on the basis of information obtained from the machine

4. Discussion
An analysis based on the assessment of the cross-section of an acorn is a derivative of viability
analysis with the standard cutting method. The analysis takes into account that the latter is a
destructive method, and therefore not suitable for the assessment of seeds intended for use in
forest management [45]. The cutting test is a tentative method of seed assessment that evaluates the
viability of the seeds based on the macroscopic examination of: embryonic development, the condition
of cotyledon tissue, and root primordia, as well as internal damage caused by fungi and insects.
The assessment is made only on the basis of the external appearance of the longitudinal section
through the tissue; hence, the test is the least unreliable in the case of the freshly harvested as well as
properly and briefly stored seeds. The following seeds are distinguished: healthy, slightly unsound,
unhealthy, damaged by larvae, and empty (without an embryo). Considering the development of
the embryo and the topography of mummification changes, it is possible to assess the expected
germination ability of seeds, assuming that for healthy seeds it is 100%, for slightly unsound seeds
50%, and that the remaining ones are considered incapable of germination [46]. Unfortunately, in the
case of scarification, seed separation is based on the distribution of necrotic foci on the cross-section
of an acorn. Irrespective of the severity of scarification, the observer can only see the cotyledon area.
Highly intensive scarification significantly accelerates and equalizes germination, as well as increases
the precision of the seed health assessment. However, leaving more nutrient reserves in a seed ensures
improved embryo development, which results in higher resistance to the negative environmental
influence, and positively affects the features of seedlings [28,47–49].
During the assessment of acorn health, the observer can make two types of errors: (1) acorns
with damaged cotyledons may be classified as unhealthy, although in reality they are only slightly
unsound, have a healthy embryo, and do exhibit a certain germination potential; (2) acorns without
necrotic lesions in the cotyledon area qualify as healthy, although the mummification of the invisible
embryonic root should disqualify it from sowing in container cells. Moreover, the assessment of acorns
stored for longer than one year may be subject to additional errors resulting from the discoloration
of the cotyledons. However, in spite of the above difficulties, the automation of image recognition
processes and the elimination of subjective perception of seed health by the forest nursery staff may
result in the optical properties of scarified acorns being an innovative distribution feature with high
effectiveness and a high application potential.
An important advantage of visual methods is their low invasiveness, accompanied by the possibility
to obtain extensive data, such as size, color, shape and a three-dimensional representation [50,51].
Publications report on the use of machine learning algorithms, which are based on the now popular,
biologically inspired, convolutional neural networks (CNN), for the purpose of the identification of
plants [52] and their diseases [53], including the use of mobile devices. A review of diagnostic tools and
non-invasive methods used in horticulture may be found in Gongal et al. [54].
The general principles of creating computer interfaces are widely known, and a vast majority
of them first referred to desktop computers. The on-board computer interfaces used in tractors and
agricultural machines are similar, and are also handled by people who use typical PC interfaces
every day. According to Juliszewski et al. [30], following adaptation to the needs of assessment or
the design of signaling devices on tractors and agricultural machinery, the principles proposed by
Banyon and Murray [55] may assume the following form: (a) the system should be adapted to the
operator, especially if the user is less adaptable; (b) the system should take into account first of all
those characteristics of the operator and the interface that have the greatest impact on their mutual
interactions; (c) the system should also take into account the needs of occasional and older users.

5. Conclusions
The separation of scarified acorns through dividing them into healthy, unhealthy, and undefined
acorns by means of computer vision has been presented. The best accuracy and precision was observed
for two image features: red components, and image brightness. For both, accuracy is also associated
with high precision, which reached up to 83%. The performance of separation was also evaluated
against the yield of acorns that were recognized as healthy in the given lot. On the basis of the
information rendered by this system, the unit that controls the device triggers an actuator of the
gripper, so that the acorn is directed to appropriate reception basket. The user interface being assessed
in the present study provides the required range of functions that meets the needs of its user, ensuring
the ease of understanding, learning, and utilization while performing tasks that are sufficient for
precise operation of the automatic device.
