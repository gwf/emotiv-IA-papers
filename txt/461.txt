Introduction. Development of a robotic arm that can be operated using an exoskeletal position sensing harness as well as a dry
electrode brain-computer interface headset. Design priorities comprise an intuitive and immersive user interface, fast and smooth
movement, portability, and cost minimization. Materials and Methods. A robotic arm prototype capable of moving along 6 degrees
of freedom has been developed, along with an exoskeletal position sensing harness which was used to control it. Commercially
available dry electrode BCI headsets were evaluated. A particular headset model has been selected and is currently being integrated
into the hybrid system. Results and Discussion. The combined arm-harness system has been successfully tested and met its design
targets for speed, smooth movement, and immersive control. Initial tests verify that an operator using the system can perform pick
and place tasks following a rather short learning curve. Further evaluation experiments are planned for the integrated BCI-harness
hybrid setup. Conclusions. It is possible to design a portable robotic arm interface comparable in size, dexterity, speed, and fluidity
to the human arm at relatively low cost. The combined system achieved its design goals for intuitive and immersive robotic control
and is currently being further developed into a hybrid BCI system for comparative experiments.

1. Introduction
Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are interactive systems that
aim at providing users with an alternative way of translating
their volition into control of external devices. Their most
popular applications lie within the scope of rehabilitation
and motor restoration for patients with severe neurological
impairment [1]. Although BCI research is currently undergoing a transitional stage of exploratory efforts [2], commercial
applications of BCIs are beginning to emerge [3].
The use of brainwaves to control robotic devices has
produced promising clinical results in terms of feasibility
[4]. Restoration of a certain degree of motor functions [5, 6]
and high accuracy control of robotic prosthetic arms using
invasive BCIs has already been demonstrated [7]. Nevertheless, in order for such BCI-controlled robotic applications to

achieve end-user maturity, the use of noninvasive, portable,
and relatively low-cost systems is considered a required
development.
Given these recent technological advances, we have
focused our research efforts in noninvasive, minimally intrusive, and low-cost BCI. We have designed, partly implemented, and tested an electromechanical robotic system to
investigate the capabilities and limitations in combining these
technologies for biomedical applications [8]. All components
used for the developed system presented in this paper have
been designed, implemented, and tested by our research and
development team.
Design requirements included fast robotic movement
that approximates the natural movement of a human operator’s arm, an intuitive and immersive interface, portability,
potential for further development, scalability, and relatively

low cost (i.e., less than $3000). We targeted investigative comparative neurophysiological scenarios in which an operator
remotely controls a 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic arm
using their arm movement, their brainwaves, or both.

2. Materials and Methods
The hybrid system under development comprises two input
devices and a robotic arm. The input devices are an exoskeletal position sensing harness (EPSH) and a commercially
available dry electrode BCI headset. The robotic arm is the
actuator device in our system and was also developed entirely
by the authors. There is no feedback to the human operator
in the proof-of-concept prototype described in this system.
The human arm, excluding the hand, possesses the ability
to move along 7 DOF: pitch, yaw, and roll at the shoulder
joint, pitch and roll at the elbow, pitch and yaw at the wrist.
Only three DOF are needed to move the hand at a particular
point in space, while the remaining 4 DOF permit humans to
approach and grasp objects from different angles.
In order to simplify the design of both the EPSH and the
robotic arm, we made the choice to omit wrist yaw, since
it does not significantly affect the ability of the robot to
manipulate objects. Still, a 7th DOF was added in order to
operate the gripper.
All parts were designed using computer-aided design
(CAD) software, manufactured using computer numerical
control (CNC) and laser cutting machines, and assembled
and tested by our team.
2.1. The Exoskeletal Position Sensing Harness. An EPSH was
developed as a form of minimally intrusive, intuitive, and
immersive interface for the robotic arm. It copies the operator’s arm movement with measurable and repeatable accuracy
(Figure 1). Apart from providing research data directly on
immersive human computer interfaces, it will also form the
basis for future comparative neurophysiological experiments
in which a dry electrode BCI headset is evaluated against
other forms of immersive robotic remote control.
The harness sensors and accompanying electronics provide real-time data on the position of the human operator’s

freedom.

joints from wrist to shoulder. Hand and finger position is
not sensed; however, a finger-operated switch allows the user
to operate the robotic arm’s gripper in order to pick up and
release items.
Copying of the human operator’s movements is achieved
through the EPSH which is worn around their arm. The
harness measures the angles between the different parts of the
arm and hand. Electronic output originating from the sensing
harness is passed on to the robotic arm’s control circuit, which
also takes into account feedback output from the robotic
arm itself. During the design phase, we, therefore, faced a
classic automation closed-loop control challenge: the input
is provided by the EPSH worn by the operator, the robotic
arm is the recipient of the control output, and a feedback loop
takes into account the actual position of the arm.
2.2. The Robotic Arm. The robotic arm is capable of the 6
following types of movement.
(i) 2 DOF for the “shoulder” joint (“right–left” and “up–
down”).
(ii) 1 DOF for the “elbow” joint.
(iii) 1 DOF for the “wrist” joint.
(iv) 2 DOF for rotation between the “shoulder–elbow”
and “elbow–wrist” parts.
The robotic arm (Figure 2) is also equipped with an electromechanical gripper, which is operated by two servomotors
controlled through a separate 7th communication channel.
2.3. The Dry Electrode BCI Headset. The selection of a
commercially available BCI headset depended on the number
of sensing channels, signal quality, price, and ease of use
[9]. The ability of electrodes to perform dry was set as an
important requirement. The inconvenience caused by the
application of conductive gel to the scalp and the timeconsuming preparation routine were considered decisive
factors in limiting our selection to dry electrode headsets.
While gel-contact electrodes provide better contact and
measurement accuracy, the goals of the planned MERCURY
comparative experiments are better served by a less precise,
less expensive wearable headset.
Furthermore, the ideal BCI headset would need to meet
the requirements of multiple data acquisition channels, low

Advances in Human-Computer Interaction
weight, and low cost. Frequency-based automatic classification of mental states by the hardware device and the
ability to export the raw EEG signal were considered, the
former being a strong factor for preference, the latter a decisive requirement. The maximum number of automatically
detected mental states was not considered a priority, since this
feature can be provided by the signal processing capabilities
of our experimental setup. Still, the capacity of a commercial
system to automatically detect multiple mental states was
considered an indirect indication of the quality and breadth
of its sensing capabilities. Thus, it was deemed a desirable—
albeit less significant—advantage.
For this reason we examined two low-cost, commercially
available headsets (Figure 3), the Emotiv EPOC [3] and
NeuroSky MindWave [9].
Both devices export raw EEG as well as processed, automatically classified mental state data. Our choice between
them depended on their sensing capabilities where the
NeuroSky MindWave uses one sensor that can provide only
three values: attention, meditation, and eye blinking. The
Emotiv EPOC uses a series of 16 sensors, which are capable
of detecting specific conscious thoughts, levels of attention,
facial expressions, and head movements (the latter using the
embedded gyroscope). The sampling frequency of the Emotiv
EPOC is 4 times greater than the NeuroSky MindWave
making it comparable to more complex and expensive virtual
rehabilitation EEG devices [10].
The drawback of both devices is the occasional unreliability of signal quality, primarily associated with the use of
dry electrodes. For this reason, the designers of the Emotiv
headset suggest that users further improve skin conductance
by the moistening of the sensors using a saline solution. While
this procedure is not ideal for our purposes, it was considered
the least inconvenient among commercially available lowcost solutions.
Despite this drawback, we selected the Emotiv EPOC for
use in our hybrid system design, since it integrates the largest
number of sensors at the highest sampling rate among all
portable low-cost BCI headsets available in the market at the
time this paper was submitted.
In the MERCURY hybrid setup, frequency-based EEG
data classification is performed both inside the Emotiv EPOC
device [11] as well as on the PC accepting raw data, depending
on the mode of operation. The PC supporting the MERCURY
hybrid system performs frequency-based analysis on selected
channels and communicates results to the microcontroller
operating the robotic arm, through a digital wired connection. The microcontroller can subsequently choose to control
the arm based on incoming data from the EPOC or the
exoskeletal sensing harness (Figure 4) or redirect both to
a fusion algorithm that produces movement instructions
(hybrid interface mode).

3. Results and Discussion
Development of the first two components of the hybrid system, the robotic arm and EPSH, has recently been completed.
Validation and characterization tests have been performed

3
in order to measure response times, angular velocity and
acceleration, maximum payload, and power consumption
(Figure 5).
3.1. Response Time. The average response time of M2, the
motor operating within the shoulder joint of the robotic arm,
was measured to be 120 ms ± 10. This was measured using
an oscilloscope, measuring (10 repetitions average) the drop
in current consumption by the motor as soon as the rotor
started rolling. This motor is the slowest in the robot, so
this measurement is used to formulate worst-case scenario
comparisons. The aforementioned value was obtained using
an oscilloscope to measure the initial setup time before the
motor starts accelerating continuously. Anecdotal evidence
from initial tests indicates that this delay is hardly noticeable
by human operators.
3.2. Angular Velocity and Acceleration. A typical range of
values for the average angular velocity of a human arm
has been reported in the literature [12] to be 23∘ –50∘ /sec
for relaxed, 36∘ –87∘ /sec for regular, and 122∘ –251∘ /sec for
strained quick movement. The equivalent ranges for average angular acceleration were 29∘ –41∘ /sec2 , 72∘ –135∘ /sec2 ,
and 721∘ –1151∘ /sec2 , respectively. These average values were
extracted from a series of experiments involving multiple
subjects moving a horizontally rotating handle, a task which
combined shoulder, elbow, and wrist movements.
We experimentally measured the average angular velocity
of motors M2 (shoulder) and M4 (elbow) of our robotic
arm throughout their full range of motion, 180∘ and 150∘ ,
respectively [12]. These two motors were selected since they
are known to be the slowest in the robotic arm, carry the most
weight, and consume the largest share of power.
The experiments were set up so that the robotic arm be
in an upwards movement (impeded by gravity) and were
performed twice, with and without an additional 50 gr load.
The robot input was to move as fast as possible, and multiple
measurements were made in order to obtain average values.
Results are summarised in Table 1.
Even though the experimental results are not directly
comparable, focusing on the slowest response times of the
robot—a deliberately pessimistic scenario—leads to some
useful conclusions. The robotic arm
(i) is capable of combining speed and acceleration that
exceed the typical range of regular human arm
movements [13], even when impeded by gravity and
carrying a small load,
(ii) is capable of accelerating faster than the human arm,
(iii) has an average speed reduction of less than 6% when
carrying a small 50 gr load (averaged across the full
range for motion for any joint),
(iv) has a qualitative attribute, not quantified yet, informally indicated by testing engineers: motion is
smooth and the control is immersive and “feels
natural”;

(v) combined with the EPSH and the BCI headset, the
entire integrated device is portable and suitable for
carriage by a single person.
Complete qualitative assessment studies are planned in the
immediate future, prior to the comparative experiments
mentioned in following sections.
3.3. Dimensions, Payload, and Power Consumption. The
EPSH measures 21 × 21.4 × 69 cm and weighs 3 kg. Including

its wooden base, the robotic arm weighs 5.9 kg. When
extended vertically, the robotic arm measures 25 × 73.9 ×
30.2 cm. The moving part of the arm measures 25 × 12.5 ×
46 cm. Its working space is approximately a hemisphere with
a radius equal to its reach (46 cm), approximately 60% the
reach of an adult human arm [14].
The robotic arm prototype has a rated maximum payload
of 300 gr. The maximum payload is 750 gr. These figures are a
direct consequence of striving to maintain low development
cost and can be dramatically improved in future prototypes.
No tests were performed with loads greater than 750 gr in
order to prevent damage to the prototype.
The robotic arm is powered by a 24 V DC power supply.
The peak current is 3.5 A ± 0.1, and the average power
consumption is 25.3 W ± 0.1. All measurements were made
with gravity impeding movement without additional load.

4. Future Work
With respect to electromechanics and electronics, the next
development steps involve integrating the selected dry
electrode headset with the EPSH and robotic arm into a
hybrid device. A PC will be capable of recording experimental
sessions in which the operator uses the headset, the harness,
or both to control the robotic arm. Once experiments are
concluded with the hybrid setup, there are further plans to
introduce a feedback loop so that the operator gains a tactile
feeling of resistance when the robotic arm touches an object
or obstacle.
With respect to software development, MATLAB-based
(the MathWorks Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, USA) software
code will process the output of the BCI headset, evaluate it
against precise motion data captured by the harness and arm,
and draw comparative conclusions. Our team is interested in
comparing the BCI output to that of a conventional 10/20
EEG data acquisition system as well as to the output of the
EPSH.

5. Conclusions

Figure 5: The first prototype robotic arm developed by our team.
It is capable of moving at angular speed comparable to the natural
motion of a human operator’s arm. It comprises 6 DC motors (one
for each DOF) and 2 servomotors for the gripper.

We have developed an intuitively controlled 6 DOF robotic
arm and accompanying operator’s sensing harness, satisfying
the design requirements for an immersive, hybrid robotic
control system. The first proof-of-concept prototype has
been developed, evaluated, and deemed adequate for the
next development step: integration with a commercial dryelectrode BCI headset. The intended research objectives for
this system include BCI optimization through comparative
experiments, using the motion and position sensing harness,
the dry electrode BCI headset, and a combination of both.
The ultimate research goals are to better understand the function of the motor cortex, improve neurofeedback training for
people suffering from neurological disorders, and optimize
robotic prosthetics.

4.1. Comparative Experiments. The novelty of our experimental setup is the ability to capture all 6 degrees of freedom
of the human arm’s physical movement electromechanically,
at low cost, with relative accuracy, and in real time. Furthermore, we plan to proceed with comparing our results
to those acquired through the use of both a commercial
BCI headset and a more conventional multichannel EEGBCI paradigm, while the subject actually performs motor
execution tasks. It is also among our research plans to
comparatively investigate the role of virtual reality (VR) in
controlling a virtual prosthetic arm versus controlling an
actual robotic arm.
A series of neurophysiological experiments involve comparison of brain activation results between scenarios of
motor execution (ME) versus motor imagery (MI) [15] and
an unrelated control scenario. We plan to compare brain
activation maps during ME tasks performed with the EPSH
of the robotic arm, as well as the dry electrode headset BCI
versus similar maps acquired during MI tasks performed with
the BCI system.
The role of functional connectivity (FCN) of the brain
in the fluid motions of the arm is also within our scope of
experimentation. We wish to explore whether graph analysis
of FCN during ME and MI of the arm can contribute towards
the goal of making BCI systems more intuitive, easy to learn
and easy to use.
A hybrid man-machine interface (MMI) and braincomputer interface (BCI) systems offer numerous investigative research advantages. Fluid and intuitive control of a prosthetic robotic arm using BCI is yet to be demonstrated, due to
limitations of current BCI data acquisition and classification
technologies. Those limitations could be addressed using the
added benefit the MMI-control parameter for the robotic arm
and artificial intelligence classifiers. The main question to
be answered, as far as this hybrid system is concerned, can
be identified in whether the unintuitive, hard-to-adjust-to
and limited in functionality BCI systems which are currently
commercially available can benefit from this approach. Are
BCIs after all destined to be exclusively used for research
and clinical purposes or could they evolve into a mature
mainstream technology?

The research leading to these results has received funding
from the European Union’s Seventh Framework Programme
(FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no 288532. For more
