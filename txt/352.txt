Abstract: Recently, the Electroencephalography (EEG) signals of human brain are considered by researchers for performing
different applications that can solve numerous problems. These research works tackle the problems of movements for sever disabled
people. In this paper, a directional control system based on EEG signals of human brain is proposed. The EEG signals are read using
a Five Channels Emotiv headset that includes seven nodes. The read EEG signals are sent using WiFi technique to the Raspberry Pi
III for processing and producing directional control signals. The four movement directions are represented by indicators as a
prototype to simulate the direction control, as well as the ON/OFF signal as a master key. Different case studies are considered to test
the proposed system over the expected circumstances.
Keywords: EEG signals, embedded systems, control system, Emotiv headset.

INTRODUCTION
A disabled person is a person who doesn't able to
move some or all of his limbs (both arms and legs). Those
persons are literally "locked-in" their bodies, have no
control over their surroundings. Such cases occur for
many reasons, for example, a spinal cord injury or brain
stroke
[1].
Researches
showed
that
electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded from the
scalp can be used in many non-muscular control and
communication systems. These systems are usually called
Brain Computer Interface (BCI) [2] and [3].
Amongst the human bio-signals, EEG signal is
considered as one of the weakest signals and it is likely to
interfere with other signals that are on the same range of
frequencies. The amplitude of such signal is very low
(0.5-100 μV), which makes it very difficult to record [4]
and [5].
In this paper, a directional control system is presented
based on EEG signals taken from human brain with
Emotiv headset. The EEG signals control the on/off of
five LEDs attached to a whiteboard and connected to a
Raspberry Pi III. Figure (1) shows the proposed system
block diagram.

RELATED WORKS

The system in [4], was proposed to evaluate the
driving of a participant in different mental situations. The
participant was experimented with a few questions
regarding his/her stress level. Meanwhile, EEG signals
were acquired by Emotiv headset, visualized and
recorded by Emotiv control panel. If the driver has been
found mentally unstable, an alarm is would ring
indicating that the driver is not ready to drive.
In [5], a system was developed to control a servo motor.
The movement of the servo motor was controlled by an
Arduino micro-controller. When the servo motor
received a pulse from the PC, it rotated at 90 o movement,

and rotated 90o backward to its original position when it
received the second pulse. The main purpose of this
research was to help people who lost their limbs due to
an accident. A BCI system was developed in [6] to
control the movement of a quadcopter by identified brain
concentration and eye blink. EEG data was captured by
Emotiv Epoc headset and sent to data processing
computer to analyze it in real time. They found that the
developed system used less data and computational
source as compared to the traditional BCI-controlled
quadcopter systems. In [7], a wearable system was
introduced that detected user's emotions from facial
expressions while the user wears glasses with built-in
camera. They used USB serial communication to transfer
the acquired images. They used intensities in each pixel
of images as features. As a consequence, they required a
dimension reduction method, because the number of
dimensions were too large to use for classification. As
compared to the wearable device used in this research, it
extracted facial expressions from EEG signals. It didn't
need a USB cable, it transferred the data wirelessly
The system in [8] showed how a Brain Computer
Musical Interface (BCMI) can be implemented with

Emotiv Insight headset as an input and signal processing
device. Data collected via Bluetooth is then routed over
the network formatted for OSC protocol. It was
concluded that the Emotiv Insight headset is a fascinating
choice for a BCIM because of its low price and ease.
3. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
The proposed system is designed based on the two
main parts: Emotiv headset and Raspberry Pi with related
LEDS. For easing the reading fluency, this section can be
divided into three subsections as follows.
3.1 THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM
The proposed algorithm can be summarized as a
flowchart, shown in Fig. 2. As mentioned above, EEG
data is collected with Emotiv headset. The user should
check first that the sensors touches his/her skin to ensure
good signal reception. The signal is then sampled at rate
128 Hz, and bandpass filtered between 0.2 Hz and 43 Hz.
Power-line noise at 50 Hz and 60 Hz are also attenuated
before the data are sent to the wireless transmitter [6]. Fig.
2a shows the headset connection flowchart.
A Bluetooth dongle is attached to the PC to receive
the signal from the headset. After the signals reception,
the headset checks weather the Raspberry Pi is On or Off.
If it was Off, the headset detects only blinking signals
and discard signals that come from other facial
expressions. In order to turn Raspberry Pi ON, the
number of blinks should be more or equal to five blinks
within six seconds. Once the number of blinks satisfies
the condition, the headset can detect other facial
expressions signal. The surprise and frown signals have
other condition to fulfil. The power of these signals has
to be above the threshold. Otherwise, the signal is
ignored. This process is depicted in Fig. 2b.

The signal is sent in a form of a message to the
Raspberry Pi. Once the message is received, it is checked

to verify its content. Each message satisfies different
condition as shown in Fig. 2c, and each condition that is
executed, sends HIGH signal to different GPIO pin to
turn an LED ON/OFF.

3.2 EMOTIV INSIGHT HEADSET
In this research, the main unit is the Insight headset,
which is manufactured by Emotiv Company and shown
in Fig. (3). It is an easy to use BCI system with
reasonable accuracy that detects EEG signals and maps
them to a computer device for further processing. The
headset technical specifications are listed in Table (1).

Emotiv headset comes with many fascinating
features, one of these is the facial expression detection
suit. This feature simulates the face of the person wearing
the headset and displays the expressions in real time on
an avatar that represents the human face. Fig. 5 shows the
facial expressions adopted in this work

In order to measure the right brain activities, it is
important to detect the signal from different cortical
structures that are distributed all around the brain [8].
The electrode locations for such headset are shown in Fig.
6.

Most EEG devices ignore the signals that are picked
up from facial muscles and the eyes and consider them as
noise. The Emotiv headset does not only filter these
signals before inferring the brain signals, but it also
classifies them to identify which muscle group are
causing them [10].
3.3 RASPBERRY PI MINICOMPUTER
The Raspberry Pi is a low price, small size computer
that is equipped with keyboard and mouse developed by
the Raspberry Pi foundation in UK. Python language was
used to program it because it is simple and easier to
understand [11]. Fig. 6 shows the Raspberry Pi III, used
in this work.

In this project the Raspberry Pi receives the signal
from the PC and uses that signal to control the LEDs
ON/OFF states as indicates through its GPIO pins.
4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In order to test the designed system, different
experiments are performed related to the considered four
directional actions as well as the on/off set. It is well
known that the directional actions are forward, backward,
right turn and left turn, represented in raising brows,
furrow brows, right wink and left wink, respectively. The
blink face action is used for activate/deactivate
(ON/OFF) the whole system as master ON/OFF switch.

53

When the user raises his/her brows, a signal is
generated from the face muscles, detected by the
electrodes and moved to PC for the next processing steps.
In order to ensure that unintentional face movement are
not considered and ignored, the user has to raise his/her
brows five times within five seconds interval. Fig. 7
shows how the green LED (forward action) is turned ON
as a consequence of raising brows.
Fig. 8 shows that the yellow LED (backward action)
is turned ON when the user furrows his/her brows. The
same technique, used above, was applied to avoid
unintentional furrowing.

Figure 9. The effect of wink right.

Figure 10. The effect of wink left.

Figure 11. The effect of blinking.

When the user winks his/her right eye, the red LED
(right turn action) on the right of the whiteboard would lit,
as expressed in Fig. 9. The same is happened when the
user winks left eye, as shown in Fig. 10 foe left turn
action. As mentioned above, the blink action is used for
activating/deactivating the proposed control system. The
user has to blink five times within five seconds in order
to turn on the red LED (ON/OFF the system) that is
located in the center of the board, as shown in Fig. 11.
Considering the accuracy of the headset, and the
fact that its sensors pick the electricity from the
environment, it has the capacity to pick up very tiny
signals. Those signals tend to interfere with the original
signals, therefore the obtained signals need to be filtered
before moving to the next step.

The obtained signals after processing are acceptable
at some level. The user has to be trained to sit relax, clear
his mind and focus on his/her facial expressions
movement. If we planned to go further with the project,
the system can be used in many applications. One of
them is controlling a quadriplegia persons wheelchair.
This could be very useful for paralyzed persons and can
help them to depend on themselves. Finally, the results
were accurate under some conditions, so that LED
ON/OFF turning can be managed with pulse signals
extracted from an EEG signal obtained from the motor
cortex of a volunteer when the person moves his/he face
muscles.

5. CONCLUSION
A directional control system is presented as a
prototype using the EEG signals. These signals were used
for controlling the movement directions: forward,
backward, right turn and left turn. They were considered
in synchronization with face reactions, such as rising
brows, furrow brows, right wink, left wink, and the blink.
Emotiv headset was adopted as an electronic device to
measure the EEG signals using five sensors allocated in
different positions. The collected signals were sent to
Raspberry Pi III for analyzing them and performing the
direction controlling. The directional movement actions
were represented in this prototype using LEDs with
different colors. Different experiments were implemented
to test the proposed system. The obtained results showed
the accepted performance of the proposed system in
terms of accuracy up to 80% ratio. This work should
open a gate for many future applications that would come
with benefit for disabled peoples, for example,
wheelchair control system, moving cursor on a screen,
etc.
