The World Health Organization estimated that major depression is the fourth most significant cause of disability worldwide
for people aged 65 and older, where depressed older adults reported decreased independence, poor health, poor quality of life,
functional decline, disability, and increased chronic medical problems. Therefore, the objectives of this study were (1) to develop
a low-cost point-of-care testing system for psychomotor symptoms of depression and (2) to evaluate the system in community
dwelling elderly in India. The preliminary results from the cross-sectional study showed a significant negative linear correlation
between balance and depression. Here, monitoring quantitative electroencephalography along with the center of pressure for cued
response time during functional reach tasks may provide insights into the psychomotor symptoms of depression where average
slope of the Theta-Alpha power ratio versus average slope of baseline-normalized response time may be a candidate biomarker,
which remains to be evaluated in our future clinical studies. Once validated, the biomarker can be used for monitoring the outcome
of a comprehensive therapy program in conjunction with pharmacological interventions. Furthermore, the frequency of falls can
be monitored with a mobile phone-based application where the propensity of falls during the periods of psychomotor symptoms
of depression can be investigated further.

1. Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that major
depression is the fourth significant cause of disability for
people aged 65 and above [1], where depression is a major
contributor to the healthcare costs associated with the elderly
population. Depression is a major health issue for elders, yet
late-life depression often goes undiagnosed [2]. One in every
four among India’s elderly (age > 60 years) population is
depressed, and around one in 10 experiences a fall that results
in fracture [3]. In fact, the elderly population is predicted to
increase to 12% of the total population by 2025 [3]. Depressed
elderly report decreased independence, poor health, poor

quality of life, functional decline, disability, and increased
chronic medical problems [1]. Moreover, psychomotor symptoms of depression may contribute to falls among elderly and
an associated fear of falling [4]. Here, course of depression,
diurnal variation, medication status, gender, and age are associated with psychomotor agitation and retardation [5]. The
psychomotor symptoms in depression have unique significance where they have high discriminative validity, may be
the only symptoms of depression that distinguish depression
subtypes, and are predictive of good response to medicines
such as tricyclic antidepressants [5]. Therefore point-of-care
testing (POCT) of the psychomotor symptoms of depression
is urgently needed in order to screen community dwelling

elderly at risk as well as to monitor the course of treatment [2],
which takes 2 to 4 weeks to work fully, and a normal course
lasts at least 6 months [5].
The costs of such screening of the psychomotor symptoms
of depression is important in a low-resource setting, for
example, in India, where a low-cost POCT of the psychomotor symptoms of depression was developed and evaluated in
this study. In fact, Indian health ministry’s working group
on noncommunicable disease burden [3] noted that “India
will soon become home to the second largest number of
elderly in the world. The challenges are unique with this
population in India.” In accordance, Kumar and colleagues
at the Dharma Foundation of India (DFI) conducted a
preliminary cross-sectional study on 95 elderly (age > 60
years) subjects from New Delhi and Gurgaon, India [6]. They
investigated psychomotor aspects of depression where they
found a negative correlation between the Berg Balance Scale
(BBS) score [7] and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)
score [8]. Also, they found that as age increased, the BBS score
decreased and the GDS score increased, leading to poorer
balance and depression. Following this alarming insight, DFI
conducted a subsampling of 24 community dwelling elderly
from their database in India that covered a wide range of
BBS and GDS scores, in order to evaluate a low-cost POCT
[9] system for the psychomotor symptoms of depression. The
first objective of this report is to present the low-cost POCT
system for psychomotor symptoms of depression. The second
objective is to present the results from the clinical study on 24
community dwelling elderly to evaluate the POCT system.
It was hypothesized that the POCT system will be able to
capture the psychomotor symptoms of depression in elderly.

2. Methods
2.1. Preliminary Cross-Sectional Study. Kumar and colleagues
conducted a cross-sectional study [6] on 104 subjects, who
were found through convenient sampling of community
dwelling elderly in Delhi and Gurgaon, India. The inclusion
criteria of the study were age of elderly 60 years and above,
both males and females, and the subjects should have the
ability to read and understand either Hindi or English. The
exclusion criteria were severe problem with vestibular and
visual system, any self-reported history of psychiatric illness
excluding depression, cognitive deficits due to any reason,
and use of assistive aids for walking, for example, wheel chair,
crutch, walker, cane. The evaluation tools used in the study
are described below.
(i) Hindi Mental State Examination (HMSE) [10, 11] was
developed for the Hindi-speaking semiliterate and
illiterate population of rural northern India. The total
score possible was 31 where the cut-off score was 19.
(ii) Berg Balance Scale (BBS) [7] consists of 14 common
tasks. The 14 items are scored on a 5-point ordinal
scale (0 = unable to perform, 4 = independent) based
on ability to complete the timed tasks.
(iii) Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) [8] is a brief questionnaire in which participants are asked to respond
to the 30 questions by answering yes or no in reference

to how they felt on the day of administration. Scores
of 0–9 are considered normal, 10–19 indicate mild
depression, and 20–30 indicate severe depression.
Only 9 out of 104 subjects were excluded on the basis
of the HMSE exclusion criteria, leading to a sample size of
95. The data was then analyzed by statistical software, as
described further by Kumar and colleagues [6], where the
descriptive statistics were calculated for the age, BBS, GDS,
and frequency statistics of Gender. The Pearson correlation
and regression analysis were applied to find out the relationship between age, BBS, and GDS. Independent sample 𝑡-test
was applied to compare the scores of BBS and GDS between
males and females.
2.2. Point-of-Care Testing (POCT) of Psychomotor Symptoms
of Depression. Following the preliminary cross-sectional
study by Kumar and colleagues [6], a convenient subsampling
of the community dwelling elderly in India was conducted to
select 24 elderly (>60 years) subjects, such that they covered
a wide range of BBS and GDS scores. All subjects gave their
informed consent for the experiments in compliance with the
Helsinki Declaration.
The objective was to evaluate a low-cost POCT system
to investigate the psychomotor symptoms of depression
affecting standing balance. The experimental setup is shown
in Figure 1. The centre of pressure (CoP) was monitored
using a Wii Balance Board (Nintendo, USA) [13] and custom
software developed using the WiiBrew toolkit [14]. The Wii
Balance Board (Wii BB) relayed the 2D ground reaction force
information to the PC via Bluetooth [14], while Emotiv EEG
Neuroheadset (Emotiv, Australia) relayed EEG data to the PC
via their proprietary wireless protocol [12]. The specifications
of the EEG Neuroheadset [12] are detailed in the Table 1.
2.2.1. Real-Time Feedback of the Center of Pressure. Wii BB
was interfaced with the PC via Bluetooth using the WiiBrew
toolkit [14]. The Wii BB has a useable surface of 45 cm ×
26.5 cm for standing which was calibrated by placing a variety
of known loads at different positions [13]. Wii BB uses four

the weight. Each sensor at each leg of the Wii BB only
measures the vertical component of the force. The CoP can be
approximated by interpolating the four vertical forces which
was then displayed to the user, as shown at Figure 2(b). The
𝑋, 𝑌 coordinates of CoP were calculated from the streaming
data using the following equation:
CoP (𝑋, 𝑌) =

∑4𝑖=1 Weight𝑖 (𝑥, 𝑦)
∑4𝑖=1 Weight𝑖

,

where Weight𝑖 (𝑥, 𝑦) are the coordinates of the 𝑖th load sensor
in the Wii BB’s reference frame, Weight𝑖 is the force recorded
by the 𝑖th load sensor, and CoP (𝑋, 𝑌) are the coordinates of
the CoP in the Wii BB’s reference frame. Also, the BBS score
was collected to identify those individuals who were classified
as “fallers” (BBS below 45) and those individuals who were
classified as “nonfallers” (BBS 45 or above).
2.2.2. Offline Analysis of Baseline Resting State EEG. Emotiv
EEG Neuroheadset wirelessly relayed EEG data to the PC
from 14 channels (International 10–20 system)—AF3, AF4,
F3, F4, F7, F8, FC5, FC6, P3 (CMS), P4 (DRL), P7, P8, T7,
T8, O1, and O2. Resting state EEG was recorded in eyesopen and eyes-closed conditions during quiet standing for at

least 3 minutes. The EEG data were analysed using EEGlab
software [15]. The eye-blink artifacts were rejected using
EEGlab functions, then the artifact-free continuous EEG was
divided into 4.096 seconds epochs using a Hanning time
window (epochs were overlapped by 50%), and an estimation
of the power spectra was found for the absolute theta (4–
7.5 Hz), alpha (7.5–14 Hz), and beta (14–20 Hz) frequency
bands for QEEG analysis [16].
Following Grin-Yatsenko and colleagues [16], a threeway analysis of variance (“anovan” in MATLAB R2010a, The
MathWorks, Inc., USA) of the absolute EEG power in eyesclosed condition was conducted with the following factors:
GDS score (three levels: 0–9, 10–19, 20–30), EEG electrode
locations (14 levels), and frequency band (three levels: theta,
alpha, and beta). We then performed cluster analysis (“clusterdata” in Matlab R2010a, The MathWorks, Inc., USA) to
compute the Euclidean distances between items in the data
set and create a hierarchical cluster tree from the data set.
Also, Linear Discriminant Classification (“ClassificationDiscriminant.fit” in Matlab R2010a, The MathWorks, Inc., USA)
was investigated to evaluate the possibility of classification
of depressive patients using eyes-closed EEG power spectra
at discriminatory frequency bands and electrode locations,
as found using multiple comparison tests (“multcompare” in
Matlab R2010a, The MathWorks, Inc., USA).

3. Results
3.1. Preliminary Cross-Sectional Study. The descriptive statistics for age were 𝑁 = 95, range = 60–89 years, mean =
70.12 years, std. deviation = 7.27 years. The correlation analysis
between age, BBS, and GDS were performed using Pearson’s
correlation test where Table 2 shows the correlation coefficients. BBS showed a significant negative linear correlation
with GDS (𝑟 = −0.423) and age (𝑟 = −0.362). GDS had
a nonsignificant positive correlation with age (𝑟 = −0.162)
at 𝑃 = 0.01 level. The regression analysis of GDS as the
dependent and BBS as the independent variables (predictor)
for the analysis of variance showed 𝐹-ratio = 20.260, which
was higher than the critical value. Therefore the variance
attributable to the regression was significant, as shown in
Figure 3. Also, the regression analysis of BBS as the dependent
variable and age as the independent variable showed 𝐹-ratio =
14.030, which was higher than the critical value.
Independent-sample 𝑡-test was used to compare the differences in GDS and BBS scores between males and females.
Table 3 shows the comparative analysis which includes mean,
standard deviation, and standard error of the mean of BBS
and GDS scores for the males and females. The 𝑡-test failed to
reveal a statistically significant difference between the mean

2.2.3. Offline Analysis of Psychomotor Symptoms. A modified
functional reach task was used to quantify the subjects’ ability
to volitionally shift their CoP position as quickly as possible
without losing balance while cued with CoP feedback via a
graphical user interface (GUI) on PC, as shown in Figures 1
and 2. This modified functional reach task (FRT) resembled
the Functional Reach Test, which has been shown to predict
risk of falls [17]. During the FRT, the subjects were asked to
keep their body rigid and to maintain full feet contact with
the Wii BB, while leaning as far as possible from forward,
backward, and to right and left sides, as cued by the GUI.
The EEG was recorded in eyes-open condition during the
consecutive FRT as well as during quiet standing (at least
3 minutes) in-between the FRT. The PT/OT conducting the
FRT reported BBS and GDS scores of each elderly subject
from a preliminary cross-sectional study (Section 2.1).
The EEG data from 14 channels (International 10–20
system), AF3, AF4, F3, F4, F7, F8, FC5, FC6, P3 (CMS), P4
(DRL), P7, P8, T7, T8, O1, O2, was analysed using EEGlab
software [15]. The eye-blink artifacts were rejected using
EEGlab functions, then the artifact-free continuous EEG was
divided into 4.096 seconds epochs using a Hanning time
window (epochs were overlapped by 50%), and the power
spectra was estimated for the theta, alpha, and beta frequency
bands for QEEG analysis [18]. The evolution of the baselinenormalized EEG power in different frequency bands (normalized by their corresponding baseline eyes-open value)
during quiet standing in-between FRT was investigated for
different GDS scores, EEG electrode locations, and baselinenormalized cued response time. The cued response time
represented latency from visual cue to correct CoP motion
out of the 95% confidence boundary of the resting-state CoP
cluster in the cued direction—forward, backward, right side,
and left side.

3.2. Point-of-Care Testing (POCT) of Psychomotor Symptoms
of Depression. We avoided using EEG data during eyes-open
condition along-with eyes-closed condition (e.g., for alpha
attenuation) since substantial eye-blink artifacts appeared for
eyes-open condition and not eyes-closed condition, which
needed to be filtered with EEGlab. The three-way analysis of
variance of absolute EEG power in eyes-closed condition with
factors GDS score, EEG electrode location, and frequency
bands revealed a significant (𝑃 < 0.01) main effect of
the factors and a significant (𝑃 < 0.01) interaction effect
between GDS score and EEG electrode location, EEG electrode location and frequency band, but nonsignificant (𝑃 =
0.09) interaction effect between the frequency band and the
GDS score. Posthoc analysis revealed an increased spectrum
power during eyes-closed condition across all frequency

bands of the resting state EEG for occipital (O1, O2) and
parietal (P8) electrode locations that correlated with worse
depression scores. Figure 4(a) shows the dendrogram plot of
the hierarchical cluster tree from the data set—mean power
measure at O1, O2, and P8 electrodes averaged over 4–
30 Hz versus GDS scores. The hierarchical cluster tree reveals
primarily two clusters, GDS = 0–15 and GDS = 15–30, that
are shown in Figure 4(b) with marker colors blue and brown,
respectively, for the scatter plot between GDS scores and
mean power measures. In accordance, Linear Discriminant
Classification was conducted using mean power measures at
O1, O2, and P8 electrodes averaged over 4–30 Hz, where the
average percent of classification was found to be >84% for
“nondepressed” (GDS = 0–15) QEEG group and >92% for
“depressed” (GDS = 15–30) QEEG group.
During the modified functional reach task (FRT), a
quicker transition to mental fatigue [18] was found in the
“depressed” (GDS ≥ 15) QEEG group as elucidated by a faster
increase in the theta band (4–8 Hz) baseline-normalized
power in the frontal (F3, F4) electrodes and a faster decrease
in the alpha band (8–13 Hz) baseline-normalized power in the
parietal (P8) electrodes. Therefore, we defined Theta-Alpha
power ratio as a QEEG marker of fatigue, which is the ratio
of mean theta band baseline-normalized power in frontal
(F3, F4) electrodes to mean alpha band baseline-normalized
power in the parietal (P8) electrodes. Figure 5(a) shows
the evolution of baseline-normalized response time during
FRT and the Theta-Alpha power ratio during quiet standing

in-between the FRT in “nondepressed” (GDS < 15) QEEG
group while Figure 5(b) shows the same in “depressed”
(GDS ≥ 15) QEEG group. In fact, there was a slight initial
decrease in the response time in the “nondepressed” (GDS =
0–15) QEEG group before long-term increase due to fatigue,
which may be due to initial selective attention to task
performance. It was found that the increase in baselinenormalized response time during FRT was quicker in the
“depressed” (GDS ≥ 15) QEEG group. Indeed, the baselinenormalized response time correlated with the Theta-Alpha
power ratio with Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient, 𝑟 =
0.2631 at 𝑃 = 0.0096 level. Also, Pearson’s linear correlation
coefficient for the “nondepressed” (GDS < 15) QEEG group
was 𝑟 = 0.2318 at 𝑃 = 0.0631 level and for the “depressed”
(GDS ≥ 15) QEEG group was 𝑟 = 0.2160 at 𝑃 = 0.1131
level, as shown in Figure 6(a). Accordingly, the dendrogram
plot of the hierarchical cluster tree from the data set—
average slope of the Theta-Alpha power ratio versus average
slope of baseline-normalized response time—provided three
clusters as shown in Figure 6(b) with blue, red, and green
colors, which compared well with the dendrogram plot of
the hierarchical cluster tree in Figure 4(a) (compare subject
number).

4. Discussion
In this preliminary cross-sectional study, balance (BBS) score
had a significant negative linear correlation with depression

(GDS) score, which implied that as the depression increased,
balance decreased, and vice versa. Since balance (BBS) score
also showed a significant negative linear correlation with age,
so depression (GDS) score could have been affected by age
via balance (BBS) score; however, depression (GDS) score was
found to only have a nonsignificant positive correlation with

age. Although correlation does not mean causality, but these
findings are consistent with those of Kose and colleagues
[19], who found that depressive and cognitive symptoms,
insufficient mobility, balance impairment and other risk
factors are related to each other. In fact, there is a vicious
cycle among these parameters. Rochester and colleagues [20]

Depression Research and Treatment
found that cognitive function, depression, physical fatigue,
and balance were significantly related to walking speed for
functional tasks. These findings are further consistent with
those of Suárez and colleagues [21] who found that agerelated changes in the neural, sensory, and musculoskeletal
systems can lead to balance impairments that affect the ability
to move around safely. Newton [22] found through multiple
regression analysis that the frequency of performing activities
and the comfort in performing activities without the fear of
falling significantly contributed to the scores on the balance
tests. The probable reason for such a finding may be that
balance and depression are both the main risk factors for falls.
These findings are consistent with those of Sai and colleagues
[23] who had reported many risk factors for falls including
a history of falls, lower extremity weakness, balance and gait
abnormalities, decreased muscle strength, old age, cognitive
impairment, medications, orthostatic hypotension, anemia,
female gender, arthritis, and psychological factors including
unipolar and bipolar depression and manic depressive disorder. Here, one limitation of our cross-sectional study design
was that we did not collect retrospective data on the history
of falls. We have now developed an Android application,
FallAlert (Gnan Systems LLP, India) [24] to monitor falls
using a mobile phone in our future studies.
The QEEG analysis of resting-state EEG showed
increased spectrum power across all frequency bands for
occipital (O1, O2) and parietal (P8) electrodes that correlated
with worse depression (GDS) scores. However, eyes-closed
EEG power spectra could reveal only two groups, GDS = 0–15
and GDS = 15–30, where mildly depressed (GDS = 10–19)
patients were included either in “nondepressed” (GDS =
0–15) or “depressed” (GDS = 15–30) QEEG groups, making
them a mix group. It was possible to classify subjects with
only <16% false positive rate and >92% true positive rate
using eyes-closed EEG power spectra. Here, monitoring
QEEG along with the cued response time during modified
functional reach tasks (FRTs) may provide insights into
the psychomotor symptoms of depression where a quicker
increase in the cued response time and Theta-Alpha power
ratio was found in the “depressed” (GDS > 15) QEEG
group, which implied a quicker transition to fatigue. In
“nondepressed” (GDS ≤ 15) QEEG group there was a slight
decrease in the Theta-Alpha power ratio from the baseline
resting-state before a long-term increase, which may be
attributed to acute effects due to selective attention related
to task performance [25]. However in long-term, there was
a faster increase in theta band baseline-normalized power
in frontal electrodes and a faster decrease in alpha band
baseline-normalized power in the parietal electrodes in the
“depressed” (GDS > 15) QEEG group. In fact, decreased alpha
power activity has been shown to be related to sleepiness,
and a decreased high-level information processing is
associated with decreased alpha power densities [26].
Therefore, a biomarker of the psychomotor symptoms of
depression was investigated using the hierarchical cluster
tree from the data set—average slope of the Theta-Alpha
power ratio versus average slope of baseline-normalized
response time, which provided three clusters that remain
to be evaluated in future clinical studies using the motor

7
agitation and retardation scale (MARS) [27]. Nevertheless,
we found a good correspondence with the QEEG group
where the biomarker of fatigue during FRT was better at
discriminating the mild depression and severe depression
(compare subject number in Figures 4(a) and 6(b)). Once
validated with MARS, the biomarker can be used to plan
pharmacological interventions targeting psychomotor symptoms of depression.
The distinctive feature of our study was in monitoring
QEEG along with the cued response time during FRT, which
provided insights into the psychomotor symptoms of depression. Here, the POCT system may also be used to provide
real-time feedback and monitoring of the biomarker, where
a comprehensive therapy program can be developed using
functional reach training in conjunction with pharmacological interventions. Furthermore, the frequency of falls can
be monitored with a freely available mobile phone-based
application, FallAlert [24], during such a comprehensive
therapy program where the propensity of falls during periods
of psychomotor symptoms of depression in elderly can be
investigated in an interventional study.
