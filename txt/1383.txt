Abstract: In recent years, research has focused on generating mechanisms to assess the levels of
subjects’ cognitive workload when performing various activities that demand high concentration
levels, such as driving a vehicle. These mechanisms have implemented several tools for analyzing
the cognitive workload, and electroencephalographic (EEG) signals have been most frequently used
due to their high precision. However, one of the main challenges in implementing the EEG signals
is finding appropriate information for identifying cognitive states. Here, we present a new feature
selection model for pattern recognition using information from EEG signals based on machine
learning techniques called GALoRIS. GALoRIS combines Genetic Algorithms and Logistic Regression
to create a new fitness function that identifies and selects the critical EEG features that contribute to
recognizing high and low cognitive workloads and structures a new dataset capable of optimizing the
model’s predictive process. We found that GALoRIS identifies data related to high and low cognitive
workloads of subjects while driving a vehicle using information extracted from multiple EEG signals,
reducing the original dataset by more than 50% and maximizing the model’s predictive capacity,
achieving a precision rate greater than 90%.

1. Introduction
Driving a vehicle is a complex activity exposed to demands that continually change due to
different factors, such as the speed limit, obstacles on the road, and traffic, among others. When
performing this activity, drivers must have a high degree of concentration, increasing the demand
related to the cognitive workload, or cause vehicle accidents due to carelessness [1]. In recent years,
various tools have been used to assess the demand for the cognitive workload generated in drivers,
such as subjective measures [2,3], vehicle performance measures [4,5], and physiological measures [6,7],
with electroencephalographic (EEG) signals having been the most frequently used to identify cognitive
states due to their high precision [8].
EEG signals allow the behavior of a person’s brain activity to be analyzed in real-time. However,
this type of physiological signal generates a lot of information per second, which increases proportionally
according to the collection time and the number of sensor channels, consequently producing large
volumes of data and resulting in complex and robust treatment [9,10].
One of the main challenges facing EEG signals is finding the right information for identifying
cognitive states. Considering this, feature selection methods have been developed for pattern
recognition using physiological signals. The feature selection algorithms (FS) aim to find a set
of features with relevant information or data that can identify or describe an event, allowing the
performance of the prediction models to be maximized [11].

Many investigations have developed models implementing FS to identify the cognitive workload
using the physiological signal’s information. In [12], it is shown that soft computing-based EEG
classification by extracting and then selecting optimal features can produce better results. The system
displays an accuracy of 93.05% and 85.00%, obtaining a low performance in real-time environments.
In [13], an attention-based convolutional recurrent neural network (ACRNN) is presented to extract
features from EEG signals and improve the emotion recognition accuracy. The system achieves average
accuracies of 93.72% and 97.73% and improves the emotion recognition accuracy by approximately
2% and 1%. In [14], an effective multi-level feature guided capsule network is proposed to extract
characteristics from the EEG signals and determine the emotional states. The method achieves an
average accuracy of 97.97% and 94.59% and presents network complexity. In [15], a channel selection
method is presented to select an optimal subset of EEG channels using normalized mutual information
(NMI). The system achieves a 74.41% and 73.64% accuracy and the channel selection method slightly
improves the recognition rate. In [16], a system for selecting and classifying EEG signals based on
common spatial patterns (CSP) is proposed, obtaining an 84.8% accuracy. The system does not include
a parameter regularization method and does not consider a real-time environment. In [17], eight
different machine learning and feature selection algorithms are used to reduce the number of features
and improve the classification performance, achieving a 97.74% accuracy. Some algorithms slightly
reduce its performance after feature reduction. In [18], a system for selecting and classifying mental
stress that implements statistical techniques and SVM, Naive Bayes, and Multilayer Perceptron is
proposed, achieving a 92.85% accuracy. This system uses information from a small dataset. In [19],
an emotion recognition system for affective states is developed based on the EEG signal using a
support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The classifier obtains a 75% and 71.21% performance accuracy
and presents problems associated with identifying negative emotions. In [20], the authors present a
quaternion-based signal analysis technique based on EEG signals to extract the registered cognitive
activity features. The model achieves an 86.44% accuracy and requires a minimum limit of samples
to obtain better results, increasing the analysis and information processing time. In [21], an on-line
classification method based on common spatial patterns is presented for feature extraction, using
SVM as a classifier and achieving an 86.3%, 91.8%, and 92.0% accuracy. In [22], different classifiers
are developed using linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbor,
SVM linear, the SVM radial basis function (RBF), and naive Bayesian based on EEG signals. SVM
obtains the best accuracy of 82.14%. In these systems, the strategy employed to extract the information
can cause a loss of vital data. In [23], the authors propose a system for detecting vigilance levels
using EEG signals and combine SVM algorithms with multi-particle optimization, obtaining an 84.1%
accuracy. The model displays a low prediction performance in some predictions due to the complexity
of the data. In [24], the authors develop a model for predicting the mental workload based on a linear
discrimination function, achieving an 85% accuracy. In this model, some physiological measures
cannot effectively reflect the mental workload, affecting the model’s prediction precision. In [25], the
common spatial pattern algorithm is used to extract information from EEG signals and a classifier is
developed using the extreme learning algorithm, obtaining an 87.5% accuracy. The model presents
a high sensitivity to the kernel configuration, affecting its performance. In [11], the evolutionary
computing algorithm is used to find an optimal dataset, obtaining a 96.97% accuracy. This model
presents premature convergence problems in the evolutionary algorithm. Finally, in [26], the Bayesian
low learning algorithm is implemented to select a dataset. SVM with RBF is employed, achieving an
89.7% accuracy. This model presents problems in the data collection phase.
In summary, several models have been proposed for pattern recognition in recent years using FS
algorithms based on physiological signals. The models described above have been based on traditional
techniques that reduce the minimum percentage of the original dataset features, obtaining robust
prediction models or analyzing the information from a specific signal to compare several features using
small datasets and discarding relevant information. Here, we propose a new feature selection model
for pattern recognition using information from EEG signals called Genetic Algorithms and Logistic

Regression for the Structuring of Information (GALoRIS). GALoRIS combines genetic algorithms
(GAs) and logistic regression (LoR), to create a new fitness function and explore the fusion of EEG
information, identifying the critical features that contribute to recognizing cognitive states, optimizing
the classification process. The dataset obtained from applying the FS algorithm is used as the index for
recognizing cognitive states in the predictive model.
GAs are adaptive and robust computational procedures based on the mechanism of natural
genetic systems inspired by the natural evolution theory of Charles Darwin [27]. GA is used to solve a
complex model’s optimization problems, by looking for the best feature set, especially when the search
space is large and complex [18].
Traditional GAs are based on the evolutionary process, which consists of selecting and combining
different characteristics, evaluating each dataset to obtain a set that best adjusts the resolution of the
problem [28]. The evolutionary process is performed in parallel in multiple directions, creating large
populations, ruling out possible solutions, and generating computationally expensive models [29].
To address this problem, we propose a new fitness function based on the LoR classifier’s
performance, in order to guide the GA search direction towards the optimal solution. LoR is a
technique characterized by its effectiveness, simplicity, and use of a low computational resource. LoR
models the probability of each element selected by GA, obtaining the feature’s weight to evaluate its
level of competence with the rest of the possible solutions, eliminating multidirectional searches in
parallel and storing the best features to create new and better populations.
The results obtained from the GALoRIS model are implemented as indexes of EEG signals
for pattern recognition in four classifiers developed with SVM with a linear kernel and RBF, linear
regression (LiR), and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and predict two cognitive states: A low and high
cognitive workload.
The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: (Section 2.1) A new collection
criterion method based on statistical techniques is employed to construct an EEG dataset defined as
a search space that GALoRIS uses to explore the information; (Section 2.2) the new feature selection
model called GALoRIS is presented; (Section 2.3) a new chromosomal structure is defined to direct the
search for the features. (Section 2.4); a new fitness function is proposed based on the LoR classifier’s
performance to determine the search direction of GA; (Section 2.5) a new technique for chromosome
selection is proposed; (Section 2.9) an original method is employed to structure the information of
multiple EEG channels, supporting datasets of various sizes; (Section 2.11) a new methodology is
presented for labeling the data that calculates the interval ranges of the information to evaluate the
subject’s cognitive states.
The rest of the work is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology; Section 3
presents the experimentation implemented; the results are presented in Section 4; and finally, the
conclusions and discussions are given in Section 5.
2. Methodology
In this investigation, EEG signal information was collected from subjects while they faced a real
driving scenario. Additionally, information on subjective measures (NASA-Task Load Index (TLX)
and Instantaneous Self-Assessment (ISA)) and vehicle performance measures (error rate (ER)) were
collected to evaluate the cognitive states of the subject during the experiment.
EEG signals were processed using the power spectral density (PSD) to extract the most
representative features in the context of the cognitive workload. These characteristics were defined as
frequency bands: Delta (0.5–4 Hz); Theta (4–8 Hz); Alpha (8–12 Hz); Beta (12–30 Hz); and Gamma
(30–100 Hz) [30].
To analyze the collected information, Student’s t-test was used to identify statistically significant
differences in the data collected during the experiment and establish a collection criterion to discard
information, in order to construct a new dataset defined as a search space that GALoRIS uses to explore
the data. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was also implemented to identify the association between

where β0 and βi are estimated from each frequency band (Banchan ) and represent the global fit of the
search space, where βi provides the basis for the feature importance score and calculates each AP. The
configuration of the chromosome changes as its elements change.
AP are calculated from the chromosome generated and they are the accuracy of the adjustment
of the elements of the chromosome, the error rate for the adjustment, the number of genes of the
chromosome, and the significant elements of each chromosome. The parameters are explained below.
The accuracy of the adjustment of the elements evaluates the performance of the generated
chromosome and is calculated as presented in Equation (5):
f it calculated
f it calculated + f it incorrectly 0

(5)

where the number of correctly predicted values divided by the total number is evaluated. The range of
values is [0, 1], where 1 indicates a high level of accuracy.
The error rate for the adjustment of the elements quantifies the error that occurs when predicting
each chromosome, evaluating the number of predictions made incorrectly. It is calculated as presented
in Equation (6):
TR = Y − Y0 ,
(6)
where the differences between the actual values Y and the predicted values Y’ are calculated. The
range of values is [0, 1], where values close to 0 indicate that the chromosome obtained a lower error fit.
The number of genes on the chromosome is used to evaluate the number of selected elements to
build the chromosome. This parameter aims to obtain a chromosome with fewer components capable of
describing the data’s behavior, reducing the probability of error, analysis time, and algorithm execution.
The significant element evaluates each of the chromosome gene’s contributions by comparing
the gene’s p-value with the significance level of α = 0.05. If the p-value is less than or equal to the
significance level, the evaluated variable is relevant and should remain on the final chromosome.
2.5. Selection
The selection process consists of building a list of chromosomes using the criteria established
in the AP, as described in Equation (7). This process begins by comparing the AP values of each
chromosome, where the chromosome with a higher adjustment rate and a lower error rate is positioned
at the top of the list. If these parameter values match, the chromosome with the fewest elements will
have the highest priority.

Two stop rules are defined to stop the evolutionary process of the model, of which at least one
must be met. The first rule is met when the number of established chromosome generations is
completed. This number is defined based on experimentation and the number of features within the

This number is defined based on experimentation and the number of features within the search space.
The second rule is met when the fitness function’s evaluation criteria are fulfilled (accuracy = 1, error
rate = 0).
2.9. Information Structuring
A new dataset is constructed based on the feature selection results, integrating the generated
chromosome elements to implement it as an input index, in order to recognize patterns in the prediction
model. In Equation (9), the general structure employed to build the new dataset is presented:
GALoRIS = {chromosome} ∴∈ New dataset,

(9)


where the chromosome represents the new dataset defined as Chr = xi yi N
i=1 , where xi rerpresents
the selected features, yi is the categorization of data, and N is the number of samples. xi and yi are
structured as presented in Equation (10), in order to organize large amounts of EEG information from
multiple channels.
h
i
xi = Ban1ch11,ch12,...,ch1n , Ban2ch21,ch22,...,ch2n , BanXchm1,chm2,...,chmn
yi = [0|1],

(10)

where xi contains the EEG signal’s data following the frequency range order and yi includes the
information of two cognitive states. In total, 8210 samples are implemented.
2.10. Classifiers
In this investigation, four classifiers were developed to implement the new dataset generated by
GALoRIS. The classifiers were designed in three steps, using the algorithms of SVM = [Linear: RBF],
LiR, and k-NN. The first step consisted of pre-processing the information, where the data were divided
into two groups: Training and testing. Here, 90% of the samples were used to train the model, and 10%
were used to perform the tests. The second step consisted of building the model with data destined to
train the model. The parameters and configurations of the model were adjusted. The last step was to
evaluate the trained model using data dedicated to testing the model.
The information was divided into training and test sets using k-fold cross-validation (k = 10).
k-fold is characterized by avoiding the overfitting of data during the model’s construction, being the
most frequently used technique in prediction studies [39]. k-fold randomly divides the data into k
subsets of an equal size, where the k-1 subset is used during the validation step, and the rest of the
subsets are used in the training step. The process is repeated k = 10 times when performance metrics
are calculated to evaluate each cycle model. The k results are averaged to obtain a single estimate. The
technique’s advantages are that all test sets are independent, and the result’s reliability is improved k
times [22,33].
The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are the sensitivity and precision. The
sensitivity metric evaluates cases that are correctly classified as true and is calculated with predictions
made correctly as a low cognitive workload (CLCW) and predictions made incorrectly as a high
cognitive workload (IHCW), as shown in Equation (11):
sensitivity =

CLCW
∗ 100.
CLCW + IHCW

(11)

Sensors 2020, 20, 5881

The accuracy metric is related to the total number of predictions made correctly and is calculated
with CLCW, predictions made correctly as a high cognitive workload (CHCW), predictions made
incorrectly as a low cognitive workload (ILCW), and IHCW, as shown in Equation (12):
Accuracy =

CLCW + CHCW

2.11. Label
In the real world, data are not labeled. Therefore, in recent years, labeling indices have been
developed, which implement the frequency bands δ, θ, α, β, and γ to identify different states, as shown
in Table 1. However, these indices only use some bands and/or channels to evaluate people’s states.

In this research, a labeling technique was developed to identify low and high cognitive workload
levels to categorize EEG information by implementing the generated chromosome.
The labeling technique consists of defining the upper and lower threshold of the dataset, and
calculating the sample’s average to obtain a vector. Afterward, the vector’s maximum and minimum
values are calculated and divided between the cognitive states, obtaining the interval’s size for each
state, as shown in Equation (13):
Thr(dataset) =

maxvalue − minvalue
,
cognitive states

(13)

where maxvalue and minvalue represent the minimum and maximum value of the vector samples,
respectively; cognitive states represent the number of states to evaluate; and Thr(set) is the size
of the interval by state. The values of each sample are compared, where sample < Thrdwn = 0 or
sample > Thrup = 1. This technique finds the peaks in the timeline defined as moments with a high
cognitive workload during the experiment.

3. Experimentation and Materials
3.1. Design of the Experiment
The Lane Change Test (LCT) version 1.2 simulator was used in the experiment, simulating a
vehicle’s most frequent driving conditions [49]. LCT is designed to quantitatively measure the level of
degradation of the subject’s performance while driving and performing other secondary tasks [42–44].
LCT consists of driving on a three-lane highway with a length of 3000 m, at a maximum speed
of 60 km/h. Along the way, instructions are presented that tell participants to change lanes through
traffic signs that appear next to the highway every 150 m. The signals are activated when there is
40 m between the vehicle and the sign. The participant must carry out the activity indicated by the
sign whilst respecting the traffic rules [50]. The experiment lasted approx. 80 min, divided into three
phases:
i.

ii.
iii.

Baseline: The participant takes a seat and places the Emotiv EPOC sensor on their head [51].
The subject keeps their eyes closed and is acoustically isolated for 10 min, where the sensor is
activated to collect information;
First Task (Task_1): The participant starts driving the vehicle without any distraction. During
driving, the EEG signals, ISA, and ER are collected. In the end, NASA-TLX is applied;
Second task (Task_2): In order to increase the subject’s cognitive workload levels, the stress
induction protocol proposed in [7] is applied as a second task. The task consists of the random
mentioning of a series of digits that the participant has to repeat, following the order of the set
of numbers given. All measurements are collected.

3.2. Subjective Measures
ISA is a questionnaire applied every 2 min during the development of an activity. The participant
must provide the number that best describes their stress level, following a scale of 1 to 5: (1) boring;
(2) relaxed; (3) comfortable; (4) little busy; and (5) very busy [52]. The questionnaire’s weighting is
calculated by assigning a weight ranging from 1 to 10 to each task, according to the level of difficulty of
the task, where 1 represents a low difficulty task and 10 is a high difficulty task. The assigned weight is
multiplied by the number provided and averaged for the activities to obtain the ISA weighting ranging
from 1 to 100.
NASA-TLX is a post-exercise application that evaluates six factors defined as dimensions that
characterize the subjective workload [53]. The methodology proposed in [24] is used to obtain the
scale, ranging from 1 to 100.
3.3. Measurement of the Vehicle Performance
The vehicle performance is associated with the ability to keep the vehicle within safety margins.
To assess this capacity, ER was implemented in this investigation. ER evaluates the total activities
performed incorrectly concerning all of the activities presented during the experiment. In [15], the
authors explain the relationship between ER and high levels of cognitive workload. The greater the
number of activities carried out during a task, the higher the cognitive workload, increasing the error
rate. To estimate the ER of each subject, Equation (14) is defined, where the sum of the activities carried
out erroneously (ae ) in relation to the total activities (at ) presented during the task is calculated.
ET =

Xat =20 a
e
,
i=0 at

(14)

where i goes from no error to the maximum number of defined activities, where the activities (a) are
the lane changes exhibited during the simulation. The errors occur when the lane changes are not
performed.

distinguished [54]. In this investigation, the signal was analyzed in the frequency domain using the
spectral power density (PSD). PSD determines the distribution of the signal power in a frequency range,
facilitating the extraction of the most popular features in the context of the cognitive workload [55].
These features are defined as frequency bands and are Delta (0.5–4 Hz), Theta (4–8 Hz), Alpha (8–12 Hz),
Beta (12–30 Hz), and Gamma (30–100 Hz) [23,56,57].
The signals are sensitive to activities called artifacts generated by the body’s movement, which
alter the quality of the signal [36]. Artifacts were removed by implementing the Butterworth filter of
order 5 with a cutoff frequency of 1 to 100 Hz based on [29,51,52]. Butterworth has a greater linear
response than other filters, allowing the efficient filtering and decomposition of EEG signals [58].
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was calculated with a Hanning window of 128 samples at a length
of T = 5s, in order to convert the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain and extract the
magnitude of the power spectrum of the delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands.

First, a dataset with all of the data was built to analyze the data. Second, a dataset was constructed
with the alpha band’s information characterized by efficiently recognizing cognitive states [60]. Third,
a dataset was built with the beta and gamma band information related to a single cognitive state [55,61].
Finally, four datasets were constructed with information related to two cognitive states [36,62]. The
band’s information was combined. All datasets followed the criterion of statistical selection, where
Bch ≤ a ∴ ∈ Search Space.
The parameters defined in this work are based on [31,58,63,64] and were configured during
model development in the training phase, selecting the one that obtained the best performance. For
GALoRIS, the number of generations is 30, with a population size of 100 genes for each generation.
A tournament selection of size t = 5 is configured, where individuals are “turned” t times to be selected.
The two-point crossover is established with a probability of crossing of 0.8 to perform mating between
two individuals. The mutation is simple, with a probability of mutating of 0.1. In Figure 7, the analysis
of the performance of GALoRIS during the evolutionary process is presented. In particular, with a
population
of 100, the algorithm achieved the best performance from generation 30.

signals. The results show that the values of the alpha, beta, and gamma bands in task_2 were higher
than those in task_1. Furthermore, the results of the delta and theta band increased during tarea_1.
These results are due to the fact each band is related to a cognitive state [8,59,65–67]. For example,
the increment in delta [68] or theta [61,69] wave activity is associated with a low cognitive workload,
fatigue, or a relaxation state. The increment in alpha [28,70], beta [68], or gamma [65,71] wave activity

These results are due to the fact each band is related to a cognitive state [8,59,65–67]. For example,
the increment in delta [68] or theta [61,69] wave activity is associated with a low cognitive workload,
fatigue, or a relaxation state. The increment in alpha [28,70], beta [68], or gamma [65,71] wave activity
is associated with a high cognitive workload, stress state, or overload of mental effort.

The ISA results indicate a significant difference between task_1 (M = 23.6, S = 38.1, t(3) = −11.54)
and task_2 (M = 46.6, S = 101.2), with a value of p ≤ 0.001. NASA-TLX had a value of p ≤ 0.04, where
task_1 (M = 25.4, S = 715.7, t(3) = −3.2) and task_2 (M = 65.4, S = 38.2) exhibited significant differences.
ER had a value of p ≤ 0.02, where task_1 (M = 3, S = 0.6, t(3) = −3.9) and task_2 (M = 8, S = 8)
exhibited significant differences. The values obtained in the EEG signals were alpha (M = −0.20, SD =
0.17), beta (M = −0.085, SD = 0.60), delta (M = 110.2, SD = 0.81), and gamma (M = −0.24, SD = 0.09),
with values of (p ≤ 0.05, t(4) = −2.656), (p ≤ 0.03, t(4) = −3.119), (p ≤ 0.03, t(4) = 3.041), and (p ≤ 0.005,
t(4)= −5.529), presenting statistically differences between the two phases of the experiment, where
alpha, beta, and gamma obtained higher values with a high cognitive workload. Moreover, delta
obtained higher values with a low cognitive workload. The theta band (M = 0.20, SD = 0.477), with (p
≤ 0.383, t(4) = 0.980), did not present a significant difference.
Table 6 presents the correlation index between the subjective, vehicle performance and EEG
signal, where the correlation is generally medium-high. Of the examined measures, ISA and RT
presented a medium-high correlation, with alpha (r2 = 0.3, r2 = 0.6), beta (r2 = 0.4, r2 = 0.6), delta (r2 =
−0.5, r2 = −0.7), and gamma (r2 = 0.6, r2 = 0.8), suggesting a convergence between these measures.
NASA-TLX is an independent measure of physiological measures, as in [72], which may be due to a
post-exercise measure. Additionally, the theta band demonstrated independence, with subjective and
performance measures.

4.4. Labeling Results
The results of applying the data labeling methodology in dataset_1 are Thrup = [0.0076, 0.0110) and
Thrdwn = [0.0110, 0.0176) labeling the data as Thrup = 0 and Thrdwn = 1. The interval threshold values
for each dataset are dataset_2 = Thrup = [0.0049, 0.0084) and Thrdwn = [0.0084, 0.0113), Dataset_3 =
Thrup = [0.0036, 0.0110) and Thrdwn = [ 0.0110, 0.0130), Dataset_4 = Thrup = [0.0043, 0.0110) and
Thrdwn = [ 0.0110, 0.0131), Dataset_5 = Thrup = [0.0072, 0.0110) and Thrdwn = [ 0.0110, 0.0134),
Dataset_6 = Thrup = [0.0026, 0.0110) and Thrdwn = [ 0.0110, 0.0131), and Dataset_7 = Thrup =
[0.0084, 0.0110) and Thrdwn = [ 0.0110, 0.0133). The threshold interval range is x < 0.0110 ≤ x in
most cases.
4.5. GALoRIS Results
Table 7 presents the GALoRIS results, where the AP obtained from each dataset created can be
observed. For example, in subset_1, the proposed method reduced the number of attributes from 36 to
13 features on average, representing 64% less of the original data, and obtained a 97% performance for
adjustment of the elements. A considerable reduction in the original dataset’s dimensionality generates
a more efficient model and is ideal in real-time applications.

Subset_2 achieved a 77% performance, with 3 selected features; subset_3 obtained 88%, with 11
selected features; subset_4 achieved 94%, identifying 16 features with relevant information; in subset_5,
17 features were identified, obtaining 95%; in subset_6, four sets of combinations were defined, with a
96% performance in each with 8, 10, 13, and 18 features; and finally, subset_7 achieved 90%, establishing
19 features.
In addition, Table 7 shows the results of the chromosomes generated in each dataset,
where each element of the vector is a chromosomes gene (Chr) that represents whether a
feature is selected. For example, in subset_1, the individual created by GALoRIS is Chr =
[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

where xn = 1 ∴ ∈ Chr0 is defined as Chr = [x2 , x3 , x4 , x8 , x10 , x11 , x12 , x13 , x17 , x18 , x22 , x26 ]. Each element
xn corresponds to a feature, creating the new chromosome with 13 selected features, as shown below:
Chr’ = [DeltaAF4 , DeltaF3 , DeltaF7 , DeltaP8 , AlphaAF3 , AlphaAF4 , AlphaF3 , AlphaF7 , AlphaP8 , AlphaT8 , BetaF7 , BetaP8 , GammaF7 ]

Table 7 shows that most of the attributes proposed in subset_4 are selected, demonstrating that
the combination of alpha and beta bands can identify the vehicle driver’s cognitive states. Otherwise,
it can be observed that subse_2 and subse_3 obtained a lower percentage for their performance, with
values of 88.79% and 77.34%, respectively.
The features with a high selection rate are Delta_F7 (p = 1.29 × 10−27 ), Alpha_AF4 (p = 4.14 ×
10−26 ), Alpha_F3 (p = 5.80 × 10−5 ), Alpha_F7 (p = 5.50 × 10−16 ), Alpha_F8 (p = 6.03 × 10−22 ),
Alpha_O2 (p = 9.14 × 10−9 ), Alpha_P8 (p = 1.76 × 10−15 ), Beta_AF4 (p = 3.38 × 10−13 ), and Beta_FC5
(p = 4.19 × 10−24 ), demonstrating that they have relevant information that can be used to identify
different cognitive states of vehicle drivers. On the other hand, the features with the lowest selection
rate are Theta_T8 (p = 0.292), Alpha_T8 (p = 0.518), Gamma_AF3 (p = 0.407), Gamma_AF4 (p = 0.501),
Gamma_FC5 (p = 0.677), Gamma_O2 (p = 0.517), and Gamma_T8 (p = 0.887).
The GALoRIS’s average runtime is 516.867 s. EEG signals comprise a high dataset dimension [73],
and this directly increases the computational complexity by structuring the data, selecting features,
and classifying the data.
4.6. Classifier Results
Table 8 shows the results obtained with each algorithm. The SVM-RBF obtained, on average,
the best performance during the training and testing phases, with a 96.50% and 96.14% accuracy,
respectively, and a 96.64% sensitivity in the model, i.e., when the driver is in a specific cognitive state,
the model is able to predict that state 96% of the time. k-NN obtained, on average, 95.80%, 95.46%,
and 95.47%, respectively. SVM-Linear obtained, on average, 84.97%, 84.87%, and 84.80%, respectively.
Finally, LiR achieved, on average, 85.33%, 85.21%, and 85.21%, respectively.

the standard deviation obtained in the test phase in each classifier.
5. Conclusions and Discussion
The results obtained from GALoRIS were compared with the most frequently used feature selection
algorithms in the literature to analyze EEG signals’ Mutual Information (MI) and conduct principal
component analysis (PCA) [74]. MI and PCA were evaluated using the seven datasets proposed in this
research, and the results are presented in Table 9.

As observed in the table, GALoRIS obtained the best performance results, achieving a total
average accuracy in the four classifiers of 90.42%, followed by MI with 83.86% and PCA with 77.81%.
GALoRIS-SVMRBF obtained the best results, with a value of 96.14%.
In the literature, work related to this research has been found, as shown in Figure 8. In [75],
a feature extraction method was explored based on rhythm entropy to classify the EEG signals. The
classification rate achieved was 89.7% using SVM with leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV). In [29],
a model with GA and SVM is proposed to classify several databases. The model obtains, on average,
a value of 91%. In [76], an algorithm employed to stabilize EEG signal patterns based on a graph
regularized extreme learning machine is proposed. It achieved a 69.67% and 91.07% accuracy. In [77],
an algorithm for selecting features based on the mutual partial information algorithm that eliminates the
less significant information of the EEG signals and develops a classifier using the linear discrimination
analysis algorithm is proposed, obtaining an 88.7% accuracy. In [78], the granger causality algorithm
is implemented to extract the most relevant EEG signal features and develop a classifier with SVM,
obtaining an 82.66% accuracy. In [79], a system for emotion classification based on the EEG signal
using statistical measures and KNN is proposed. The system achieved an 86.12% accuracy on average.
In [80], emotional stress state detection using a genetic algorithm and k-NN based on EEG signals
is proposed. It achieved a 71.76% accuracy. In [81], a system multi-objective genetic algorithm and
SVM are designed to find the most relevant features and classify the EEG signal. They achieved a
94.4% accuracy. In [82], feature selection is developed based on a genetic algorithm using regularized
neighborhood component analysis to enhance the motor imagery signal’s classification performance.
The system achieved a 78.9% accuracy on average. In [83], a classifier based on multimodal EEG
data is proposed for depression recognition using genetic algorithms and SVM, k-NN, and decision
trees, achieving an accuracy rate of 86.98%. In [84], a feature selection algorithm of EEG oscillatory
activity related to motor imagery using a hierarchical genetic algorithm is presented, achieving a
76.04% accuracy. GALoRSI-SVM obtains an accuracy of 96.14% in data classification, significantly
improving the classifier performance.

Although the average processing time of GALoRIS was 516.867 s, this is regarded as an average
time based on [39,78,83,85]. It is essential to consider that the selection of features is a procedure that is
only carried out once and does not affect the model’s test time. It was observed that the processing
time was reduced by 80% at this stage.
Future work on this research topic will implement a new dataset to assess the model’s predictive
ability developed in this research.
