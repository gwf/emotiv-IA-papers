Abstract—The revolution in technology affects many fields and
among them the Healthcare system. The application-based
computer was developed to help specialists to detect diseases, and
to perform some basics operations. In this paper, focus is given
on the proposed attempts to detect Epilepsy Disease (ED). Several
Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) methods were used to provide
the brain’s disease status according to signals related to brain
activities. These applications achieved acceptable results but still
have their limitations. An intelligence CAD based on the

INTRODUCTION
Brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Epilepsy Disease
(ED) [1] are consuming vast resources of the health care
system. Several methods have been proposed for the automated
diagnosis of brain diseases. Many Computer-Aided Diagnosis
(CAD) methods use Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals [2],
physiological signals [3], or wearable sensors and smartphones
[4]. Most recent works employ EEG signals instead of other
methods due to their accuracy. The EEG is capable to read the
brain’s electrical signals generated by neurons measured
through the scalp. Electroencephalography is the process of
measuring the brain’s neural activity as electrical voltage
fluctuations along the scalp as a result of the current flowing in
the brain’s neurons [5, 6]. The brain’s electrical activity is
monitored and recorded, in typical EEG tests, using electrodes
that are fixed on the scalp [7]. A Brain-Computer Interface
(BCI) system enables individuals to communicate through
external devices by using their brain's electrical signals in the
recording positions of the scalp. This can help to recognize
anomalies of frequency patterns or accomplishing several tasks

and seems to have many potential applications. This paper
highlights the main issues of these methods, taking into
account the proposed attempts to detect brain diseases and the
fact that several methods based on CAD were used to identify
ED using EEG signals. This paper contributes by highlighting
the deficiency of a huge EEG database and techniques that
were used may need a hardware accelerator to reduce the time
duration of their applications.

LITERATURE REVIEW

Traditional medicine is based on visual inspection to
recognize features assigned to brain diseases. This kind of
inspection suffers from low accuracy while it is timeconsuming. In this section, many related works on recognizing
ED based on machine learning techniques supported by
different CAD tools are presented. Authors in [2, 4] attempted
to analyze EEG signals in detective and predictive data
analytics by applying different intelligent classifiers to identify
a range of signals related to brain diseases. Authors in [7-9]
attempted to detect epilepsy outcome features through the EEG
signals with artificial neural networks. In [7], the authors
proposed an enhancement of the SNN model and reached an
accuracy of 92.5%. In [8], the authors followed a wavelet
methodology for nonlinear features. Then, a LevenbergMarquardt backpropagation neural network method was
performed, resulting in an accuracy of 96.7%. Authors in [9]
proposed the use of the multi-spiking neural network technique
and the reached accuracy was about 90.7%. Authors in [10]
analyzed the EEG features according to a multi-spiking neural
network with a new supervised learning algorithm. The
accuracy is 94.8%, which was better than the result obtained in
[9].
Authors in [11-17] applied the Gaussian Mixture Model to
the EEG signals. An accuracy of 93.1% was reached in [11]. In
[12-14], the authors used the Support Vector Machine as the
main idea. The wavelet transformer obtained an accuracy of
96.3%, the recurrence quantification analysis achieved an
accuracy of 95.6%, and the discrete wavelet transformation an
accuracy of 96%. In [15, 16], the authors used Fuzzy Sugeno

applied to Entropy and Higher-order spectra methods. The
achieved accuracy was around 98.1% and 99.7%. This method
is challenged by its huge need of processing time and hardware
resources. In [17], a deep learning methodology was used by
applying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model
formed by a 13-layer Neural Network achieved an accuracy of
88.7%. Authors in [18, 19], proposed an epilepsy detection
method based on the Gaussian Mixture Model with 93.1%
accuracy. Authors in [20], used the SVM methodology
followed by the power spectral density estimation method, with
the accuracy not exceeding 93.3%. Authors in [21], combined
the SVM and the tunable Q wavelet transformer with 98.6%
accuracy. Authors in [22], analyzed the EEG features using the
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method with 93.5% accuracy.
Authors in [23] proposed an advanced algorithm for the
recognition of seizures based on EEG features. These
characteristics are extracted from the signal in temporal
domains. A Back-propagation Neural Network (BNN) was
used to achieve an accuracy of about 93%. Authors in [24]
found the EEG frequency by applying a wavelet transformer to
the spectral components. Then the Mixture of Expert (ME) was
performed as a classifier to achieve an accuracy of about
94.5%.
Authors in [25] achieved an accuracy of about 98.68%
when using a Decision Tree (DT) as a classifier. Authors in
[26] proposed the use of cross-correlation coefficients to
extract statistical features. Based on it, the SVM classifies the
input EEG signal with about 96% accuracy. Authors in [27]
attempted to improve the recognition accuracy by using the
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier. But the

obtained results showed an accuracy of 91.8% which was
inferior to previous attempts. Authors in [28] applied the SVM
to the entropy features associated with the EEG signal with
97.25% accuracy. Authors in [29] proposed the Local Neighbor
Description Pattern (LNDP) as a new technique to extract
features. This technique was tested by different classifiers
including SVM, DT, and ANN. LNDP technique fused with
ANN had the highest classification accuracy of 98.72%.
Authors in [30] tried to detect epilepsy using the brain
activities measured by the EEG signals. The signals were
processed according to the position of electrodes and analyzed
with the use of an adaptive mixture of the independent
component. A symmetric-weighted scale-invariant local
ternary pattern technique was applied to the obtained signals.
The achieved features trained a neural network, reaching an
accuracy of 99.53%. Authors in [31] attempted to overcome
the problem of the variability of feature distribution by
applying an Adaptive Median Feature Baseline Correction
(AM-FBC). This method was followed by the SVM. Features
were defined by a matrix of determinants and a successive
decomposition index. The sensitivity was enhanced to achieve
96.6%. A summarization of the most significant studies on
brain disorder disease recognition using computer-aided
diagnosis can be seen in [32].

OPEN CHALLENGES

This section discusses the results achieved by the above
mentioned techniques in detecting brain diseases based on the
EEG signal. The discussion is performed considering the
reported drawbacks. In the light of this brief review, the EEG
signal represents a powerful criterion for the detection of brain
diseases. According to the studied disease (seizures, epilepsy,
Alzheimer’s, etc.), the extraction phase tries to extract data
from the EEG signal based on some features related to the
specificity of the disease. This phase could be performed to an
EEG signal depending on domains. The next phase applies
different classifiers to obtain recognition accuracy. The
shortcomings related to the recognition of brain diseases based
on the EEG signals are:
• Uncertain accuracy: commonly the obtained accuracy is
higher than 90%. Most works use the public EEG database
in [33]. It is composed of five datasets (A, B, C, D, and E)
collected from only 5 participants. Therefore, the findings
must be implemented in a larger database allowing result
generalization. As mentioned above, several studies
achieved different accuracy values despite the use of the
same classifier and dataset. This can be explained by three
reasons: (1) differences in the use of the dataset, (2) the
extracted features are not always the same, and (3)
difference of domains (time, frequency, and timefrequency).
• Non-real-time: most previous works implement advanced
algorithms for the detection of brain diseases. Hence,
algorithms were not executed in real-time due to the
considerable computation time they demanded. Authors in
[34] proposed a hardware implementation based on an
FPGA board to ensure real-time detection. The authors used
the SVM algorithm and achieved an accuracy of 86%. This
result proved the decrease of the performance when
implementing the algorithm on board. The need for a CAD
framework deployed on a hardware board that maintains
high accuracy is a necessity.
• Non-predictive: All previous works do not support disease
prediction for a healthy person.
As a conclusion, the detection of the epilepsy disease using
CAD tools still needs improvement in both software and
hardware. The accuracy of the recognition had to be improved
and the execution time should be decreased to ensure real-time
response. These objectives are attained by performing the
BCA-SVM [35] algorithm and by deploying it in a Raspberry
Pi 4 board. In this paper, a system based on the BCA-SVM
method as an intelligent algorithm to recognize the epilepsy
disease at an earlier stage is presented.
IV. THE PROPOSED METHOD
The aim of this study is to detect signs related to the ED
according to the measured EEG signals. The BCA-SVM
algorithm is applied to the EEG signals. This technique is
chosen in order to ensure both speed and accuracy. During the
training phase, the model is built through a set of input data.
This phase requests an increasing number of processors and a

www.etasr.com

Vol. 10, No. 5, 2020, 6462-6468

6464

set size which reduces the performance of the algorithm. The
prediction phase is the easiest one due to the speedup and the
parallel processing. The proposed BCA-SVM technique
follows these steps: (1) Preprocessing, (2) feature extraction,
(3) classification, and (4) evaluation.
A. Preprocessing
This step aims to normalize the EEG signal. The
normalization is important due to the frequency bands
associated with the difference of the frequency magnitude. The
normalization aims to scale features, while the obtained values
are more user-friendly. The filtered/raw values are scaled. The
z-score method is used for normalization [32]:
 =





(1)

where V is the value of the feature to be scaled, M is the mean
value of the feature, and S is the standard deviation of the
feature. This method is adopted because it manages outliers.
Secondly, focus was given on augmenting data in the
dataset. This goal aims to improve the obtained results of the
training. The data augmentation was done with the use of the
synthetic minority over-sampling technique. This method
provides new samples based on the neighborhood method
without re-using the available data. This method provides new
samples belonging to the same original distribution. The most
common challenge encountered in the ED research is the
limited datasets and the limited data included in a dataset. This
issue reduces the accuracy of CAD tools based on machine
learning algorithms. The data augmentation step attempts to
increase the amount of data in the dataset. Data drawn as a
signal are segmented to attain a signal of equal length and
associated with the same label as the original data. In our case,
the length of the EEG signal is 10s. This process increases the
number of available signals in the dataset from 40 to 96.
B. Feature Extraction
ED features are determined based on five frequency bands
considered as signals of interest. These bands are described by
the following restriction:
0 <  < 4
 4 <  < 8
8 <  < 12
12 <  < 30
30 <  < 50

It is necessary to apply a low pass filter to the signals to
remove high frequency components. Through these frequency
bands, the feature extraction could be defined. In the current
study two key features were considered: (1) the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) and (2) the Continuous Wavelet transform
(CW) features. The FFT is applied to frequency signals to
define the average magnitude related to all FFT coefficients.
The Fast Fourier (FF) features are defined according to:

C. Classification
In this paper, focus is given on the training phase to
overcome the mentioned shortcomings. Sequential Minimal
Optimization (SMO) classes are introduced to divide the data
set and to build the BCA-SVM kernel. Figure 1 describes the
proposed technique.

The BCA-SVM method is the final step of the procedure. It
classifies data based on the local learning model. The samples
are divided according to different zonal, region, sub-region,
and local region. The learning process proceeds as follows: (1)
the samples are learned as a sub-region, (2) sub-regions of
samples are joined to form a region, (3) the regions are
integrated as a zonal of samples. The balanced condition used
for prediction is computed under the number of zonals per
level. The balanced value corresponds to the result of the
number of zonals per level divided by the number of each
specific zonal. Algorithm 2 (Figure 3) details the functionality
of the proposed BCA-SVM algorithm.

The proposed architecture based on BCA-SVM.

The implementation proceeds with the K-means algorithm.
This classifier has some shortcomings: (1) K-means
partitioning suffers from regularity and balance, (2) K-means is
unpredictable because it dependents on data. An improvement
is proposed to the K-means by applying the First Come First
Served (FCFS) algorithm. Algorithm 1 as shown in Figure 2
describes the proposed enhancement. We assume that a
clustering center corresponds to a machine node. The goal is to
look for the closest center for every sample. The K-means is
enhanced when a data center has n/m samples. The algorithm
begins with a general definition. Then the machine node center
and the balanced value are initialized. The treatment part
manages data to find the center for each sample. The
optimization step is done to improve the achieved result.

D. Evaluation
The necessary metrics to measure accurately the prediction
and evaluate the classification performance are presented in
this section. The validation is used 10 fold.

into a Raspberry Pi 4 [34] tied with the EEG device Emotiv

CPU usage, and memory demand.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In this section, the proposed CAD based on the BCA-SVM
method and using the dataset in [33] is verified and the
implementation phase is described.
A. Verification
The verification is applied to samples considering ED and
healthy (H) cases. The evaluation of the BCA-SVM method is
presented in Table II. The proposed related to the ED cases
reached 99.8% accuracy and 100% sensitivity and specificity.
Nevertheless, the results related with regard to the H cases
achieved 95.1% accuracy, 92.6% sensitivity, and 89.9%
specificity. The obtained accuracy proves that the proposed
BCA-SVM method gives a reliable decision of the health status
of the studied cases. The accuracy covers both TP and TN
results. The sensitivity highlights that our method detects
consistently the ED. An error of about 8% is computed when
considering healthy persons. The specificity defines the rate of
cases correctly detected without ED. The achieved performance
metrics attaint certain detection of the ED. A comparison
between our findings and previous works is presented in Table
III. It can be seen that the BCA-SVM achieves the best results.

B. Implementation
The verified CAD has been implemented with the use of
the earlobe electrode landmark [38] and a Raspberry Pi 4 [36].
The EEG signals were recorded according to the International
System metrics. Measures were taken when the eyes were
closed, ensuring the same dynamic process. In the test phase,
the record is defined as follows: duration of 120s, 1024Hz
frequency, and sampling by 256. This implementation aims to
provide an accurate device to predict ED. The device has to
take into consideration real-time requests. The Raspberry Pi 4
was connected with the EEG device [37] via Bluetooth. The
BCA-SVM was developed using Python and run on the
Raspbian GNU/Linux 9 operating system. The Raspberry Pi 4
was chosen because it runs codes in Python, and it provides
high-level APIs as Scikit-Learn library [39]. The performance
of the proposed device depends on the memory usage, CPU
temperature, and CPU average load. The memory resources are
defined by memory usage. The requested memory varies
between 17 and 24MB. The Raspberry Pi board provides the
needed memory. Figures 4-6 present the results related to
hardware factors. The CPU temperature curve is highlighted in
Figure 4. The average temperature was around 66°C. The arm
processor did not need a cooling mechanism because the
temperature did not exceed 85°C.

The CPU average load defines the average number of
processes loaded by the CPU during the studied period. Figure
5 shows the number of loaded processes for 120s. The CPU
manages between one and two processes at the same time (the
average is about 1.4). An intermediate buffer between the CPU
and the primary memory has to be considered to ensure
accurate running. The CAD tool could be considered as a realtime system. The CPU usage factor defines the occupation
status. This factor could shut down the CPU when the
occupation rate achieves 100%. Figure 6 shows the variation of
usage during the 120s period. The CPU usage did not exceed
92% and the average rate was about 83%. All these results
related to the architecture factors prove that Raspberry Pi 4 is
sufficient for the ED detection using the BCA-SVM method.
The execution time request by the Raspberry Pi 4 board is
about 3.2s, allowing the conclusion that it obeys the real-time
demands. Table IV summarizes the hardware performance
related to the implementation of the BCA-SVM method on the
Raspberry Pi 4 board.

is around 3.2s. Moreover, the proposed method did not need a
special hardware board. A Raspberry Pi 4 board provided
sufficient memory size, and CPU speed to perform the
framework. This proposed attempt can be extended to
recognize other brain diseases such as Alzheimer's. The CAD
tool has to support prediction in order to enhance pre-emptive
care.
VII. CONCLUSION
The main subject of this paper is the detection of the ED.
The detection of ED is challenged by increasing reliability and
real-time constraints. To obtain reliable performance, a CAD
framework based on k-means and the BCA-SVM method was
proposed. The case classification is evaluated according to
accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity metrics computed through
the [33] dataset. The classification performance of the proposed
method reached the high accuracy of 99.8%. The system was
validated and tested on an EEG device and a Raspberry Pi 4
board in which the BCA-SVM algorithm was deployed. The
memory usage was about 25MB and the board in our case did
not suffer overheating. The arm processor was sufficient to
ensure processing.
Early detection of the ED presents a great challenge. In
future work, we will attempt to move from diagnosis to
prediction by the detection of abnormal EEG signals which can
lead to ED.

VI. DISCUSSION
As mentioned above, the ED detection using the EEG
signal faces three major issues: (1) accuracy, (2) real-time
response, and (3) prediction. During this attempt, we dealt with
the problems of accuracy and real-time response. Despite the
high accuracy of the previous works, the findings were
uncertain because of the small size of the considered dataset. A
data augmentation method was proposed based on the synthetic
minority over-sampling technique. The obtained accuracy
(99.8%) is more significant and solid in comparison with other
works.
Hardware performance is a critical factor in the
implementation phase. The requested time to make a decision
