ABSTRACT Assessing the data quality of wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) systems is critical to
collecting reliable neurophysiological data in non-laboratory environments. To date, measures of signal
quality and spectral characteristics have been used to characterize wearable EEG systems. We demonstrate
that these traditional measures do not provide fine-grained differentiation between the performance of four
popular wearable EEG systems (the Epoc+, OpenBCI, DSI-24 and Quick-30 Dry EEG). Using two
computationally inexpensive metrics of undirected functional connectivity (phase lag index) and directed
functional connectivity (directed phase lag index), we compare the integrity of the phase relationships
captured by wearable systems to those recorded from a high-density research-grade EEG system (Electrical
Geodesics Inc). Our results demonstrate that functional connectivity analyses provide additional
discriminatory information about wearable EEG systems, with clear differentiation of the cosine similarity
between research-grade functional connectivity patterns and those generated by each wearable system. We
provide a freely available Matlab toolbox containing all metrics described in this paper such that
researchers and non-experts interested in wearable EEG systems can easily assess the quality of systems not
characterized in this study, thus advancing the translation of EEG research into non-laboratory settings.

I. INTRODUCTION

Effective translational research requires collecting highquality neurophysiological data in non-laboratory settings.
Electroencephalography (EEG) uses non-invasive scalp
electrodes to measure the electrical activity of cerebral
cortical neurons, and is a popular method of collecting
neurophysiological data due to its relative accessibility and
low cost compared to other neuroimaging technologies (e.g.
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI);
magnetoencephalography (MEG)).
Although EEG is
typically recorded by sophisticated medical instruments
operated by professionally trained experts, there has been a
recent proliferation of portable and affordable single- and
multi-channel EEG devices marketed for personal and
everyday applications [1]–[6]. These devices – referred to
as consumer-grade EEG, mobile EEG, translational EEG
and wearable EEG – have become increasingly popular due
to their low cost, their ease of setup and their relatively
acceptable performance [7]. To date, they have been used
in applications ranging from clinical monitoring (e.g.

epilepsy [8]); assistive technologies (e.g. brain-computer
interfaces [9]); and monitoring the mental state of workers
[10], drivers [11], and athletes [12].
As EEG signals are weak and prone to noise, obtaining
high quality EEG data is a common challenge. Medical and
research groups have extensively tested the quality of
wearable EEG systems (e.g. [13]–[16]). These devices are
typically compared to research-grade EEG equipment on
the basis of 1) EEG signal quality; 2) spectral properties of
continuous EEG recordings; and/or 3) the detection of
event-related potentials (ERPs). EEG signal quality is
typically assessed by the percentage of artifactcontaminated EEG, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the
collected data [16]–[20]. Spectral properties are evaluated
in relation to established phenomena, such as the Berger
effect, and band power variation in relation to various tasks
[14], [17], [18], [20], [21]. The ability to detect ERPs in
various environments is another common metric of the
quality of a mobile EEG system [14]–[16], [19], [21]–[23].

These traditional comparison metrics for wearable EEG
systems have their roots in the neuroscientific concepts of
functional segregation and the localization of function in
the brain. However, since studies of patients with brain
lesions led to the refutation of localization as a complete or
sufficient account of cortical organization, neuroscientific
studies have shifted their focus to functional integration and
connectivity, with the annual increase in publications on
connectivity surpassing the year increase in publications on
activation in 2011 [24]. While the application of functional
connectivity metrics to EEG data has become increasingly
popular, the quality of wearable EEG systems has never
been evaluated according to these metrics. The motivation
for this paper was to develop the infrastructure to enable
non-experts to assess the quality of wearable EEG systems
with respect to measures of functional connectivity.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: we
briefly present the background of functional connectivity in
Section II. The description of the four wearable EEG
systems, the research-grade EEG system and the details of
data acquisition and analysis are presented in Section III.
Section IV compares the four wearable EEG systems
against traditional research-grade equipment using signal
quality, spectral measures and functional connectivity
measures. Sections V and VI conclude the paper with
observations/discussion, conclusions and directions for
future work. This paper also provides a freely available
Matlab toolbox containing these measures, which can be
effectively used to assess the quality of wearable EEG
systems.
II. FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY

Functional connectivity has become a powerful tool for
assessing neural phenomenon such as conscious awareness
[25]–[28], and has been used to characterize both neural
dysfunction [29], [30] as well as state transitions in the
brain [31], [32]. Functional connectivity measures
statistical dependences among remote neurophysiological
events [24] and can be directed or undirected. Undirected
functional connectivity is calculated from phase coupling of
band-limited oscillatory signals, or from coupled aperiodic
fluctuations of signal envelopes [33]. Common examples of
techniques used to assess undirected functional connectivity
(dependencies) include various measures of synchrony,
correlation and coherence [34]. Directed functional
connectivity metrics consider the temporal precedence of
two signals. Prime examples of directed functional
connectivity include partial directed coherence [35],
directed transfer functions [36], Granger causality [37],
symbolic transfer entropy [38], and directed phase lag index
[39].
Of particular interest to the field of wearable EEG systems
are the measures of phase lag index (PLI) and directed
phase lag index (dPLI) due to their robustness against
volume conduction and their low computational cost, which

makes them amenable to real-time calculation in a wearable
system. Moreover, PLI and dPLI have successfully been
used to characterize brain network properties with
significant clinical implications, including loss and
recovery of consciousness [27], [31], [40] and delirium
[41], and to identify network-level changes in conditions
such as autism [42], dementia [43] and fragile X syndrome
[44].
To date, wearable EEG systems have been evaluated based
on metrics examining local EEG features, rather than on
EEG connectivity features. As functional connectivity -- by
definition -- measures the statistical dependencies between
two electrodes, this metric is only applicable to multisensor, rather than single-point sensor, systems. In this
paper, we select four multi-channel, wearable EEG headsets
that represent a range of cost, electrode coverage and ease
of setup, and compare their ability to reproduce the
functional connectivity patterns of a research-grade EEG
system.
III. METHODS
A. ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY DATA
ACQUISITION, PRE-PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS

An overview of EEG data acquisition, pre-processing and
analysis are presented in Figure 1. EEG data were acquired
from one research-grade headset and four wearable headsets
(Table 1). We considered an EEG system to be wearable if it
was mobile and wireless, enabling EEG to be recorded
outside of the laboratory [16]; and a research-grade system a
high-density, wired EEG system, widely used in research
studies. All systems were setup according to their respective
best practices (e.g. acceptable levels of impedance), detailed
below.
Headset 1: 128-channel HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net
from Electrical Geodesics Inc. (EGI). The electrode net was
soaked in a solution of potassium chloride and baby shampoo
for 10 minutes prior to application. The electrode net was
landmarked to Cz, and impedances were reduced to below 50
kΩ prior to data recording. All channels were referenced to
Cz, and data was collected at a sampling rate of 500 Hz.
Headset 2: Quick-30 from Cognionics. The 30 dry
electrodes in this headset did not require any preparation
prior to application. Electrode impedance was reduced to
below 1 MΩ by removing the hair from under the electrodes
and gentle abrasion of the scalp prior to data recording. All
channels were reference to A2 and sampled at 500 Hz.
Headset 3: DSI-24 from Wearable Sensing. The 24 dry
electrodes in this headset were mounted on articulating
bearings that maximized contact against the scalp. The
electrode impedances were reduced to below 1 MΩ using a
special tool that parted the hair around and below the

electrodes. All channels were referenced to Pz and data was
sampled at a frequency of 300 Hz.
Headset 4: EPOC+ from Emotiv. Electrode sponges from all
14 channels were soaked in Ag/AgCl saline solution for 10
minutes prior data collection. Impedances were reduced to
below 20 kΩ by parting the hair and moving the electrodes to
make good contact with the scalp. All channels were
referenced to P3/P4 and data were sampled at 256 Hz.
Headset 5: Ultracortex “Mark IV” EEG Headset with Cyton
Biosensing Board (8-channel) from Open BCI. The 8channel system was composed of a Cyton 8-channel
Biosensing Board, and a 3D printed headset which secured
Dry Comb Electrodes. The system was fabricated and
assembled according to instructions on the OpenBCI website
(http://docs.openbci.com). It was not possible to measure
electrode impedance; thus, signal quality of each channel was
assessed through visual inspection, and electrode positions
were adjusted to maximize signal quality. Data were
referenced to A2 and sampled at 250 Hz.
After data collection, the EEG was bandpass filtered using a
finite impulse response filter between 0.1 and 50 Hz and rereference to an average reference. All segments of data
containing noise or non-physiological artifacts were
identified by an investigator experienced in reading
electroencephalograms and removed in EEGlab. Segments
containing excessive sweat artefact (i.e. more than 2 standard
deviations away from the mean) that persisted over 5 seconds
were removed from the data. Segments containing high
frequency electromyogram (EMG) artefacts were also
removed from the data. Channels that did not record reliable
EEG data (e.g. due to poor contact with the scalp) were
identified through visual inspection of the waveforms and
channel-specific spectrogram and removed from the data.
Electrooculogram (EOG) artefact was not removed from the
EEG data from any headset; while techniques such as
independent component analysis (ICA) would have
effectively removed this artefact, they are more effective on
headsets with a greater number of channels, and this preprocessing step would have biased the subsequent analysis
towards higher-density systems. The cleaned EEG was then
analyzed using EEGapp, a freely available Matlab toolbox
(www.github.com/BIAPT/EEGapp).
1) Spectral and Topographic Analysis
Spectrograms were computed between 1-30 Hz using the
multitaper method, with window lengths of T = 2 s, step
size of 0.1 s, time-bandwidth product NW = 2, number of
tapers K = 3. Electroencephalographic data from all
available channels were used in the analysis. Scalp power
distributions at 10 Hz – the subject’s peak alpha frequency were also calculated across the average spectrogram using
the topoplot function in EEGlab [45].

2) Functional Connectivity Analysis
Functional connectivity between all combinations of
electrode pairs was assessed using phase lag index (PLI)
and directed phase-lag index (dPLI). These metrics were
chosen over other measures of functional connectivity such
as coherence, as they are sensitive only to nonzero phase
lead/lag relationships, and thus reduce the problem of
volume conduction [46]. The instantaneous phase of each
channel of the EEG was extracted using a Hilbert
transform, and phase difference t was calculated between
channels, where
,, t = 1,2,…,n, where n is
the number of samples in one epoch and i and j included all
channels in the EEG headset. PLI was then calculated as
follows:

Here, the sign() function results in 1 if
, 0 if
, and -1 if
. Thus, a PLI value close to 1
indicates that the instantaneous phase of one signal is
consistently ahead of another, and the phases are locked,
whereas a PLI value close to 0 indicates no consistent phase
lead or lag relationship between channels. The direction of
the phase-lead/lag relationship between channels i and j
were calculated using dPLI [39].

Here, H(x) represents the Heaviside step function, where
H(x) = 1 if x > 0, H(x) = 0.5 if x = 0 and H(x) = 0 otherwise.
Thus, if on average signal i leads signals j, dPLI will be
between 0.5 and 1, and if signal j leads signal i, dPLI will
be between 0 and 0.5. If there is no phase-lead/phase-lag
relationship between signals, dPLI = 0.5.
To quantify the effects of spurious phase relationships,
surrogate datasets were calculated as follows. The phase
time series of channel i was maintained, while in channel j,
the phase time series from 0 to x was changed with the
phase time series from x to n, where n is the number of
samples in one epoch, and 0 < x < n. Thus, existing phase
relationships were eliminated while maintaining the
spectral properties of each condition. The data were
permutated 20 times, and PLI and dPLI values were
corrected by subtracting the mean of the surrogate dataset.
Functional connectivity was calculated across delta (1-4
Hz); theta (4-8 Hz); alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz)
frequency bands. As the functional connectivity within both
hemispheres of the brain were symmetric, PLI and dPLI
results are only presented for the left hemisphere, according
to the schematic illustrated in Figure 2.
3) Comparison of Wearable System to the Gold Standard
The frequency of the dominant power peaks in each
spectrogram were compared between wearable systems and
the gold standard system. Topographic maps were

compared based on the location of the dominant power
across brain regions.
To compare the functional connectivity patterns between
devices, the number of channels in the high-density system
was reduced to match the number of channels and channel
locations of each of the wearable headsets. Each wearable
headset was aligned to the gold standard system by
matching all electrodes with 10-20 labels (e.g. Fz, C3, P4)
to their corresponding counterparts. For all electrodes
without a 10-20 label, the Euclidean distance to all nearest
neighbours of the gold-standard headset was calculated
using EGI’s default 3D electrode location position file. The
electrodes in the high-density system with the shortest
distance to the electrode in each of the wearable systems
were selected to generate comparative functional
connectivity data.
The PLI and dPLI matrices were compared against the
gold standard using cosine similarity, defined as:

where bi and bj are the connectivity values for the wearable
headset (i) and the gold standard headset (j) [47]. Cosine
similarity ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates identical
functional connectivity patterns between headsets, -1
indicates diametrically opposite functional connectivity
patterns between headsets, and 0 indicates orthogonality or
decorrelation.
B. CASE EXAMPLE

The added value of functional connectivity in assessing
wearable EEG systems was demonstrated in a case example
of a single participant (n=1) (male, 24 years) using the four
wearable systems and the research-grade system.
Continuous EEG was recorded in two 2-minute blocks: 1)
eyes-closed rest; and 2) eyes-open rest. Data collected from
each headset were compared using spectral, topographic
and functional connectivity analyses. Data from each
headset were segmented into non-overlapping 10-second
epochs, and functional connectivity was calculated for each
frequency band, for each epoch. Average functional
connectivity for each state was generated by averaging
connectivity across all epochs.
To establish how representative these single block
recordings were of headset performance across sessions, we
also collected 10 sessions of eyes-closed rest and eyes-open
rest from the same subject across five different days, at
various times of day (i.e. morning, afternoon and evening)
for two EEG systems. The three EEG analysis metrics were
averaged across the ten sessions, and the average
spectrogram, topographic maps and functional connectivity
matrices were compared to those computed for the single
block recording.

IV. RESULTS
A. TRADITIONAL QUALITY METRICS DO NOT
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN WEARABLE EEG SYSTEMS

The percentage of artifact-contaminated EEG and the
spectral properties of continuous EEG recordings are
traditionally used to assess the quality of wearable EEG
systems. Of the four wearable EEG systems tested in this
study, poor signal quality affected data recorded from two
headsets: the Quick-30 (3 channels) and the EPOC+ (2
channels). These channels were eliminated from subsequent
analysis (Figure 3a). Spectral analysis demonstrated that all
systems were able to detect the Berger effect - an increase in
alpha power in the eyes-closed condition (Figure 3b), while
one wearable system (the EPOC+) was unable to detect the
posterior dominant rhythm at 10 Hz in parietal and occipital
regions (Figure 3c). Cumulatively, while these quality
metrics reveal the limitations of several systems, they do not
provide a fine-grained differentiation between performance
of wearable EEG headsets.
B. FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY PATTERNS
EFFECTIVELY DISTINGUISH THE QUALITY OF
WEARABLE EEG SYSTEMS

Functional connectivity and directed functional connectivity
patterns were calculated across delta, theta, alpha and beta
bandwidths. In this section, we focus on comparing the
functional connectivity patterns in the alpha bandwidth,
which has been strongly linked to cognitive functioning [48]
and conscious awareness [31], [49]. Functional connectivity
patterns in delta, theta and beta are presented in the
Supplementary Material (Figures S1-S3). While the nuanced
comparisons between wearable headsets and the gold
standard headset differ across bandwidths, the conclusions
that can be drawn about the quality of each wearable headset
are consistent with those in the alpha bandwidth.
The functional connectivity patterns generated from the
research-grade EEG system were used as the gold standard
against which the wearable headset patterns were compared.
As expected in the research-grade system, posterior regions
showed high functional connectivity during the eyes-closed
condition, and central regions showed moderate functional
connectivity during the eyes-open condition (Figure 4a, left
column). A feedback lead/lag relationship dominated in
posterior regions (e.g. from central to parietal, from central to
occipital) in the eyes-closed condition and was diffusely
present in all regions in the eyes-open condition (Figure 4b,
left column).
Functional connectivity and directed functional connectivity
patterns for each wearable headset are presented in Figure 5
and Figure 6, respectively. The Quick-30 EEG system
displayed more frontoparietal and fronto-occiptal functional
connectivity than the gold standard in the eyes-closed
condition (PLI cosine similarity = 0.68), and was more

similar to the gold-standard in the eyes-opened condition
(PLI cosine similarity = 0.75). Feedback connectivity was
present in anterior regions (c.f. posterior regions in the goldstandard) during the eyes-closed condition (dPLI cosine
similarity = 0.84), and was more similar to the gold-standard
in eyes-open conditions (dPLI cosine similarity = 0.91)
(Figure 3, Quick-30 A versus B).
The DSI-24 EEG system presented higher functional
connectivity across all electrode pairs in the eyes-closed
condition (PLI cosine similarity = 0.82), but similar patterns
in the eyes-open condition (PLI cosine similarity = 0.87). It
captured the posterior feedback lead-lag relationship, but also
spurious centroparietal lead-lag relationships in the eyesclosed condition (dPLI cosine similarity = 0.85). Lead/lag
relationships were near identical to the gold-standard in the
eyes-opened condition (dPLI cosine similarity = 0.97)
(Figure 3, DSI-24 A versus B).
The EPOC+ EEG system presented spurious functional
connectivity in the eyes-closed condition (PLI cosine
similarity = 0.85) and was unable to reproduce patterns of the
eyes-open condition (PLI cosine similarity = 0.79). While the
dPLI cosine similarity was 0.92 in the eyes-closed condition,
directed functional connectivity showed patterns opposite of
those expected (e.g. feedforward lead-lag relationships), and
the eyes-open condition presented random lead/lag patterns
(dPLI cosine similarity = 0.75) (Figure 3, EPOC+ A versus
B).
The OpenBCI Cyton Dry EEG system produced spurious
functional connectivity between the parietal electrode and all
other channels under both eyes-closed and open conditions
(PLI cosine similarity = 0.62, 0.65, respectively). It did not
capture the expected phase lead-lag relationship patterns
under either condition (dPLI cosine similarity = 0.79, 0.78,
respectively) (Figure 3, OpenBCI A versus B).
While signal quality, spectral analysis and topographic
analysis did not differentiate the quality of all four wearable
headsets, the results of the functional connectivity analysis
provided additional discriminatory information. Across all
frequency bands and both eyes-open and eye-closed
conditions, the DSI-24 had the highest cosine similarity to
the gold standard functional connectivity and directed
functional connectivity patterns, followed by the Cognisonics
30 and EPOC+, with the OpenBCI headset presenting the
lowest cosine similarity to expected patterns (Figure 7).
C. SINGLE SESSION RECORDINGS ARE
REPRESENTATIVE OF AVERAGE PERFORMANCE OF
WEARABLE SYSTEMS

Spectrograms, topographic maps and functional connectivity
matrices calculated from the EGI high-density system and
the DSI-24 were compared between a single session (e.g. one

two-minute EEG epoch) and an average of ten 2-minute EEG
epochs recorded at various times of the day across 5 different
days. The single session functional connectivity data was
near identical to the averaged data across both gold standard
(PLI cosine similarity = 0.97; dPLI cosine similarity = 0.995)
and wearable systems (PLI cosine similarity = 0.991; dPLI
cosine similarity = 0.999) (Figure 8). This degree of
similarity demonstrates that the comparisons of headset
performance based on single session data are representative
of the average performance of the wearable systems.
V. DISCUSSION

In this paper, we demonstrate that functional connectivity
metrics can provide complementary information to signal
quality and spectral measures in assessing the quality of
wearable EEG systems. We compared four wearable EEG
systems (the Quick-30, DSI-24, EPOC+ and OpenBCI) to a
traditional research-grade EEG system from Electrical
Geodesics Incorporated. Despite following best practices for
setting up the equipment, the Quick-30 and the EPOC+ had
several channels with poor signal-to-noise ratios. The quality
of the wearable EEG systems could not be further
distinguished using spectral nor topographic analysis, with
the exception of the EPOC+, whose data resulted in a
spurious lateralization of the posterior dominant rhythm [50].
Assessing the systems with functional and directed functional
connectivity provided additional information. The OpenBCI
system did not produce the expected patterns of functional or
directed functional connectivity. The Quick-30 and DSI-24
reproduced expected phase lead/lag relationships and regions
of dominant functional connectivity. While both systems
were inferior to the gold standard (e.g. exhibiting spurious
functional connectivity in the eyes-closed condition), this
analysis demonstrated the integrity of the phase data recorded
by each headset.
To date, comparisons of wearable EEG headsets to research
grade systems have used signal-to-noise ratios, power spectra
and topography, as well as event-related potentials as
assessment measures. This is the first study to compare
wearable EEG headsets on the basis of functional
connectivity metrics [14]–[16], [17], [18]–[23]. As measures
of functional integration and connectivity become more
dominant in the neuroscience literature [24], there is
increasing incentive to use these measures on EEG data
recorded from translational, wearable headsets. Our analysis
demonstrates the feasibility of applying functional
connectivity analysis to EEG data collected from select
wearable systems. Additionally, our results illustrate that the
inclusion of functional connectivity metrics in the
comparison of wearable EEG systems provides users with a
more nuanced assessment of the quality of these systems.
While a direct comparison of our functional connectivity
results against other studies is not possible, our signal-tonoise ratio and power spectra and topography results are

consistent with other studies, lending credibility to our
analysis. In a recent review of “consumer grade” EEG
systems as research tools, Sawangjai et al. reviewed studies
from the past five years that used wearable EEG devices as
the primary equipment for data collection [7]. Similarly to
our findings, reviews of studies that used the Emotiv EPOC+
concluded that data quality, sensor location and electrode
number posed considerable challenges when comparing this
headset to “medical grade devices”, while the OpenBCI was
more comparable to research grade devices on the basis of
signal quality and spectral properties. Our results provide a
new dimension for the comparison of these two popular
wearable headsets, demonstrating that the functional
connectivity patterns were less similar to a research-grade
EEG system in the OpenBCI than in the Emotiv EPOC+.
Our demonstration of the added advantages of assessing
translational EEG systems with functional connectivity
measures need to be interpreted in light of several limitations.
First, we evaluated the performance of the headsets on a
single-subject basis, as opposed to a group-average.
Although this limits the generalizability of our results, we
believe that the performance of a wearable EEG system on a
subject-by-subject basis is strongly associated with its
translational potential. The need for individualization in
translational EEG applications has been established, as there
is significant heterogeneity in EEG characteristics across the
population [51]–[53]. Our case study enables us to compare
the quality of the selected EEG headsets on a single-subject
level, where idiosyncratic neural patterns – such as our
participant’s lateralized posterior dominant rhythm – are
visible, as opposed to on a group level, where individual
patterns are often averaged out. This within-subject
comparison highlights the ability for wearable EEG systems
to reproduce the subject-specific patterns that are visible in
the gold-standard EEG system, providing information that is
more relevant to the translational potential of wearable
headsets than a between-subject comparison. Second, each
headset had a different number and topographic distribution
of electrodes. While we accounted for this variability by
reducing the gold standard to the nearest-neighbor electrodes
for comparison, this may bias the analyses for some headsets.
For example, the Emotiv EPOC+ had a sparse distribution of
electrodes in posterior brain regions, which skewed the alpha
(10 Hz) topographic power map analysis towards frontal
regions, in comparison to headsets with a more uniform
electrode distribution. Third, we assessed the headsets only
on the basis of one measure of functional connectivity (phase
lag index) and one measure of directed functional
connectivity (directed phase lag index). While these metrics
were chosen because of their robustness to volume
conduction and their relatively low computational power (i.e.
their translational potential), it is possible that other measures
of functional connectivity (e.g. envelop-based connectivity
metrics, information theory-based connectivity metrics) do

not provide the same discriminatory power between headsets.
Finally, all headsets were assessed based on continuous
rather than event-related EEG metrics. The ability to robustly
detect ERPs in various environments has often been used as a
marker of quality of mobile EEG headsets; the results
presented in this paper provide a complementary assessment
to this popular approach and are particularly relevant for
translational EEG applications focused on characterizing
connectivity patterns in brain networks.
To accompany this article, we developed a freely available
open-source Matlab toolbox for spectral, topographic and
functional
connectivity
analysis
(www.github.com/BIAPT/EEGapp). Calculating functional
connectivity on neurophysiological data typically requires
neuroscientific and computational expertise, which presents a
significant barrier to non-experts in both these domains. Our
toolbox enables individuals without expertise in both fields to
conduct these analyses on EEG collected from both wearable
and research-grade systems. Computer scientists with limited
medical expertise benefit from receiving the EEG data and
all necessary accompanying information in a pre-defined
MATLAB structure format – the output of the popular
EEGLAB software package [45] – and clinicians with
limited computing expertise benefit from a simple user
interface which automates many sections of the analysis (e.g.
comparison of functional connectivity against surrogate data)
that are required to accurately interpret the results.
Furthermore, the open-source nature of our toolbox allows
the interested researcher to customize individual functions
for their needs and to incorporate individual sections into
larger analysis protocols.
Together with the open-source toolbox, the results of this
study lay the groundwork for using EEG-based functional
connectivity measures in non-laboratory and non-research
settings. Functional connectivity changes recorded with
research-grade EEG systems have been implicated in
distinguishing loss and recovery of consciousness [27], [31],
[40] and delirium [41]; the DSI-24 headset presents a highquality wearable option for detecting these conditions in
clinically-relevant settings (e.g. the intensive care unit,
operating room). Functional connectivity patterns have also
been used to identity changes associated with autism [42],
dementia [43] and fragile X syndrome [44]; future
applications of this current research can investigate the
feasibility of using high-quality wearable systems to translate
such findings to point-of-care diagnostic and assessment
devices. While the findings of this study apply only to
phase-based measures of functional connectivity and the
quality of wearable EEG headsets based on other types (e.g.
envelop-based) of connectivity remains an open-research
question, it provides a strong template for evidence-based
selection of the highest-quality system for collecting
neurophysiological data in non-laboratory settings.

VI. CONCLUSION

Functional connectivity provides complementary information
in the assessment of the quality of wearable EEG systems
and can be used to generate more nuanced distinctions
between otherwise-comparable systems. The inclusion of this
metric in wearable EEG system assessment is further
warranted by the increasing interest in brain connectivity in
the neuroscientific community. We provide an EEG analysis
toolbox that allows researchers and non-experts to explore
spectral and functional connectivity properties of EEG in
hopes that the translational neuroscientific community will
be able to benefit from and contribute to these tools.

Figure 8: Comparison of single session metrics to average metrics generated from 10 sessions
recorded over multiple days for (A) research-grade (EGI) and (B) wearable (DSI-24) EEG
systems. Spectrograms, topographic maps, phase lag index and directed phase lag index matrices show
near identical (e.g. cosine similarity > 0.97) patterns between single session and averaged recordings.
