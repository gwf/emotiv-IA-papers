Evidence-Based Training and Adaptive Control: Exploring the
Cognitive and Neural Processes and the Interface between the
Pilot and Flight Control Systems (Work-in-Progress)
ABSTRACT
The safety of an airplane depends highly on the pilot’s skills, experience, workload, and
mental states. For student pilots, evidence-based training strategies are ideal. The present study
recorded Electroencephalography (EEG) of five pilots at various levels of certification as they
completed a flight session containing one takeoff, missed approach and landing and two circuits
each with an enroute, arrival, and instrument approach segment. Each pilot completed five
sessions in an Advanced Aviation Training Device (AATD). Three segments were chosen from
each circuit for initial analysis: takeoff, enroute 1, and approach 1. EEG brainwaves observed
across multiple frequency bands were found to have changed over the segments. In particular, we
found that the theta band, often an indicator of drowsiness, decreased for the majority of
participants. We also computed the engagement index, which was generated as a composite of
three EEG channels: alpha, delta, and theta. The engagement index is a measure of workload and
mental activity, and it seemed to correlate with the participant’s training and flight experience.
INTRODUCTION
Aviation is a high-consequence industry where safety is paramount and error is costly,
both in human and economic terms. Additionally, it is a dynamic industry where cockpits and
flight control systems are developing rapidly in the digital age. Such factors serve to create a
learning environment with increased mental pressure and workload on pilots as they develop
their skill and adapt to new technologies and systems. According to Yongchao, Tao, et al., the
workload and stress on aspiring pilots may impact learning and lead to other undesirable
consequences like pilot errors that could lead to flight accidents [1]. Pilot error contributes to a
higher number of crashes than other factors like weather and mechanical failure.
The purpose of this study is to understand the cognitive and neural mechanism of pilots
as they complete routine flight activities. It is a preliminary study that is part of a broader
collaborative research effort that seeks to enhance the integration of pilots and flight control
systems, improve flight education strategies, and facilitate designs of adaptive control for
humans and machines. The present study has three objectives: First, to identify the mental and
cognitive processes of pilots in each of the segments performed in a flight scenario. Second, to
correlate EEG, demographic, and performance data. Finally, to identify any anomalies and look
for correspondence across the data.
Pilots were asked to complete five sessions to capture potential variations in performance
and attributes from the perspective of their mental mechanisms. Each session contained seven
segments including one takeoff, missed approach and landing and two circuits, each containing
enroute, arrival and instrument approach segments. The instrument approach was the same for
all circuits and sessions. During this initial analysis, we focused on three segments: takeoff,
enroute 1 and approach 1.

parameters being studied include mental fatigue,

situation awareness, anxiety, stress, and emotion in real aircraft and flight simulators [1, 3, 6-16].
A few studies have used pilot performances to correlate and understand the psychological
aspects of pilots [7, 10, 17, 18]. The present project seeks to extend this research by using high
fidelity experiments to explore neural functions carried out in a realistic training environment
and focusing on the physiological evolution related to student pilots’ training and education
process.
METHODOLOGY
Participants and Procedures
A total of five participants were recruited from a four-year undergraduate professional
pilot degree program. Each participant completed five sessions. The EEG of Participant D failed
to be recorded in one session. Therefore, a total of 24 sessions were analyzed. Participants A and
B each held a commercial certificate with a multi-engine rating. Participants C and D were
private pilots while participant E was a student pilot (Figure 1). All the participants except
Participant E held an instrument rating. All participants had at least 25 hours experience with an
Advanced Aviation Training Device (AATD). Participant E was the only participant with zero
actual instrument conditions and less than 25 hours of simulated instrument conditions.
Informed consent was obtained from each pilot before beginning the research while
explaining the research objectives and procedures, in accordance with applicable Institutional
Review Board (IRB) requirements. All data was maintained on encrypted devices and deidentified with a discreet participant code to maintain confidentiality.
Experimental Design and Materials
Data collection methods included EEG signals, AATD flight data, observations, video
recordings, surveys, and unstructured interviews. A pre-survey was given to the participants
prior to the flight-simulation sessions. The pre-survey included 21 questions related to flight and
training hours, certifications, AATD experience, learning beliefs, etc. Participants were asked to
perform the designated circuit twice in each session, with the first terminating with a missed
approach (Figure 2). The flight plan developed and used in this effort included: takeoff, enroute,

arrival, approach, missed approach, enroute-2,
arrival-2, approach-2, and landing. The participants
were also provided with charts for the instrument
approach.
EEG data was collected using a 14-channel
headset (Emotiv Inc.). Figure 3 shows the electrode
positions [19]. The electrodes had sensor pads presoaked in saline. The sampling rate of the EEG
signals was 128 Hz. The EEG signal was pre-filtered
between 0.16−43 Hz. Analysis began with the
synchronization of the flight data with the EEG data.
The segments corresponding to takeoff, enroute 1,
and approach 1 were used to develop the brain
heatmaps in MATLAB. The topography heatmaps
are a representation of the powers of the EEG signal
in each of the four frequency bands: delta (0.25−4
Hz), theta (4−8 Hz), alpha (8−13 Hz), and beta II
(20−50 Hz). Note that we did not use beta I (13−20
Hz) because it is believed to generally agree with the
alpha band [5]. In each frequency band, the power
Figure 2. Flight circuit used in each session
was normalized by the entire-frequency power in
0.1−50 Hz, according to a previous study [20].
Engagement index, EI, was computed as the beta-II power divided by the sum of alpha and theta
powers.
Flight data was obtained from the X-Plane flight simulator software on the AATD. The
AATD had three high-definition televisions that provided approximately a 120º external
environment view. A Diamond DA-20 aircraft model was used for all sessions. The flight
parameters collected included: altitude, pitch rate, roll rate, yaw rate, the angle of attack,
airspeed, vertical velocity, gravity load, density ratio, elevation, lift to drag ratio, latitude, and
longitude. The visibility was set to three miles, winds
calm, and a ceiling of 1000ft. MSL. Video recordings
were made with a camera attached to the AATD to
observe the behavioral elements of pilots, as well as their
verbal communication. Participants were randomly asked
about their experiences at the end of the sessions.
This article is limited to the initial analysis of
takeoff, enroute 1, and approach 1. In the flight data,
takeoff was identified by the airplane position in terms of
longitude. The second segment, enroute, started when the
aircraft reached an altitude of 2500 MSL and an
appropriate latitude. The approach segment was
identified when the aircraft reached the Initial Approach

respective data sets and the time stamps of the individual segments.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
EEG activity
Figure 4 shows the relative power of all the electrodes in each frequency band obtained in
the last (5th) flight session for individual participants. Warm colors represent high powers, and
cold colors represent low powers. The first row shows the powers for takeoff; the second and
third rows show powers for enroute and approach, respectively.
In general, the delta band did not show consistent or meaningful changes (Fig. 4A) with
the flight operation. This is not surprising because delta waves mostly appear during deep sleep.
Similarly, a previous driving-simulation study also showed minimal changes with the delta [20].
Figure 4B shows the power of theta wave. Theta is the frequency range most closely
associated with drowsiness (i.e., a sign of sleep onset) in adults [20]. The energy in theta
decreased over the flight session, indicating that the participant became less drowsy as the flight
continued. Such a state of decreased drowsiness is consistent with our expectation, given the
nature of the flight segments, where the pilot tends to be less engaged during the enroute phase
but highly engaged during the approach. Most participants had decreased signal power in the
approach segment. Participants A, C, and D show continuously decreased theta activity over
time. Participant B shows a relatively stable and elevated theta over time which may indicate a
higher degree of
skill or experience,
even than
participant A.
Participant E
showed very high
theta power in
enroute indicating a
relatively high
degree of
drowsiness. It might
be that, because
Participant E did not
hold an instrument
rating, they were

the approach phase,

a very low theta power was observed, indicating relatively greater alertness than the other
participants. These outcomes merit further investigation.
Regarding the alpha wave, it has been hypothesized that decreased activity indicates
more cortical neurons participating in transient task performance [21]. Here, the participants
generally showed decreased alpha activity, especially during approach (Fig. 4C). Meanwhile,
beta II is associated with increased alertness and arousal. Figure 4D shows the change of beta II
for each participant in one representative flight session. Certain patterns are similar to the alpha
wave, but there are also differences. For example, Participant A showed the highest alpha
activity during takeoff but highest beta activity during the approach.
For participants A, C, and D, the frontal lobe electrodes (AF3, AF4, F3, and F4), showed
the highest activity at the beginning of the flight session (takeoff and enroute ). The frontal lobe
has been shown to have connections with many important cognitive skills, including motor
skills, problem-solving, and memory [22]. The symmetrical activation indicates equal use of the
hemispheres. Decreased theta power in the frontal lobe indicates elevated alertness in the
approach. However, we need to caution that the electrode position does not strictly correspond to
brain areas.
Pilot profiles and correlations to EEG
More relevant to the tasks than the individual frequency power may be the engagement
index, which has been highlighted in previous studies [23]. The engagement index is computed
as 𝐸𝐼 = 𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑎 𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟/(𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎 𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 + 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑡𝑎 𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟), which is positively proportional to the
beta and negatively proportional to the alpha and theta power. Figure 5 shows the EI’s for all
participants and sessions
over the three segments.
Here the EI shown in the
bar plot is the maximum
across all electrodes for
each scale topography.
Although some
participants and sessions
showed unusually high
EI’s during approach and
enroute, in general, EIs
appeared to be more
strongly correlated with
participants’ experience
and skill rather than with
particular flight
segments.
The bar plots
show that participant D
had the largest EI values,
which were significantly

higher than the EI values of all other participants (t-test, p < 0.01). In addition, the EI values
varied greatly in some sessions for D, indicating that the participant was struggling at particular
moments. For example, the enroute of the 5th session was unusually large. This finding agrees
with participant D being the least experienced pilot with an instrument rating but does not
account for the similarities between participants D and E. A more detailed analysis will be
performed to examine the video recording, in search for corresponding flight behavior.
Participant E, the student pilot, had EI values significantly higher than B and C; the values were
not significantly different from A.
Flight behaviors
In general, participants with a Commercial Multi-Engine rating (A and B) appeared to
behave differently in comparison to participants with less advanced ratings. From observational
data, pilots A and B exhibited greater discipline and were more systematic in their activities
compared to the other pilots. In contrast, participants C, D, and E appeared to become frustrated
and confused as the sessions progressed. While it is not possible to draw firm conclusions
without additional analysis, the observations suggest correlations between observed behavior and
the high engagement index of participant A, the stable theta value of participant B, decrease theta
values of participants A, C, and D.
CONCLUSION
The three objectives of the study were to identify the mental and cognitive processes of
pilots in each of the segments performed in a given training situation, to correlate the EEG data
with pilot's demographic and performance data, and to identify any anomalies and look for
correspondence across the data.
The objectives were partially achieved, and analysis will be continued to understand the
cognitive and neural aspects of pilots in detail and to support the observations attained across the
multiple frequency bands. Given that only three segments were analyzed, further implications are
expected to be drawn by examining the remaining segments.
