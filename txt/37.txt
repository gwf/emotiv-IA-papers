ABSTRACT Neurofeedback training (NFT) teaches self-control of brain activity to the subjects by
measuring brain waves and providing a feedback signal in real time. NFT is considered to be a promising
tool for healthy people to enhance cognition, however its specific effects on response-conflict are unknown.
This study employed 50 healthy participants into two groups (NFT group = 25, control group = 25), in order
to explore the NFT effects towards response-conflict resolution phenomenon. Changes in Absolute power
and functional connectivity in different bands of response-conflict EEG, were investigated. The EEG of each
participant was recorded while performing a response-conflict task before and after NFT. The results show
an increase in theta and alpha band powers and functional connectivity. No training specific modulation is
observed in beta band functional connectivity. A significant improvement in theta and alpha band functional
connectivity is observed in the NFT group that is not present in the control group. These findings provide
a strong rationale for the use of NFT in the resolution of response-conflict phenomenon in healthy human
beings.

I. INTRODUCTION

Balanced control over brain activity is very important
for better cognitive ability and is required for accurate
and fast performance. The level of this control among different people is different and is studied by the changes in
response time (RTs) and response accuracy (RA) in responseconflict tasks, such as the Stroop task [1]. In such tasks, focused attention is required to overpower the response-conflict
effect featured by the stimulus congruency effect. The task’s
irrelevant features (incongruent features) embedded in the
stimulus structure tries to divert the attention of the performer
resulting in slower RTs and less RA [2]. This effect is
called; the congruency effect. The executive-attention theory
suggests that those having high working memory will have
better control of attention and will overcome the congruency effect more easily. Different therapeutic procedures are
adopted to enhance the attention ability of human beings,
one of them is called Neurofeedback training (NFT). NFT
is a training procedure devoted to gaining control over the

A

brain. Generally, NFT is a method of providing real-time
information of one’s brain activity so that individuals can
learn conscious control of their own brain activity [3]. Besides its successful outcomes in neurological and psychiatric
disorders such as ADHD [4] [5] and schizophrenia [6], NFT
is also considered a great potential for cognitive enhancement
in healthy individuals [7] [8]. Hence its effects are explored
on creativity and cognitive performance enhancement [7] [9]
, and in sports [10].
The intuitive experimental protocol of NFT is to modulate
brain activity in a target frequency band non-invasively, such
as an individual upper alpha (IUP) band [11]. The target
frequency band for NFT is always chosen based on the
empirical results from previous studies. It is believed that
each frequency band is associated with cognitive functions
[12] and successful modulation of the chosen band activity
will lead to cognitive improvements [13], for example working memory [14] [15]. As mentioned earlier, the executiveattention theory suggests that this improvement is beneficial

for better conflict processing. However, the conventional
taxonomy of frequency ranges is arbitrary and therefore, the
brain signals are not isolated in terms of frequency [12].
Thus, the generators of these bands are largely unknown
[12]. Therefore, there is an effect of one frequency band on
the other frequency bands as well [12]. For this reason, in
NFT, the modulation of the target frequency band may also
have an effect on the non-target frequency band. Keeping
this in mind, we explored the effect of NFT in different EEG
bands (i.e. in alpha band (because the real-time feedback was
provided in this band) and in theta and beta band (because
of the enhanced bio-coherence between these two bands
[16])). Specifically, we tried to investigate how NFT can
change different EEG bands activity and how it affects the
cognitive control (i.e. response conflict processing) in healthy
participants.
Since NFT has been used to modulate large scale neural
networks, both, structural [17] and functional [18] brain
connectivity changes. Many studies have proven the evidence
of the changes in brain networks after NFT. The functional
connection of the brain dynamics can be different due to
individual differences in cognition [19]. Enhanced functional
connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was
observed during an attentional cognitive task after a single
session NFT at the mid-posterior site (Pz) [18]. Similarly,
changes in the amygdala, insula, and cingulate cortex were
observed after NFT [20] [21]. Although abundant literature
about NFT research discusses the protocol validation, we
tried to consider NFT as a tool in a healthy population to
address the brain connectivity changes in attentional control. Particularly, a with-in subject NFT design allowed us
to manipulate/explore the brain connection among different
brain regions as a cognitive enhancement measure. Much of
the cognitive neuroscience research manipulates the evoked
response potentials (ERPs) for brain activation changes during a cognitive task [22]. On the contrary, brain connectivity
after NFT allows the manipulations of the synchronization
among different brain regions during cognitive tasks and
provides a new insight to investigate cognitive performance.
In the current study, we utilize this approach to explore the
synchronization of brain oscillations after NFT.
The treatment protocol for NFT is mainly focused on
alpha, beta, theta, gamma, or a combination of them, for
example, alpha/theta. Research studies have explored the role
of alpha activity in cognition [23] [24] and confirmed that
higher alpha activation is linked to better cognitive processing. Cooper et al. observed that alpha activations are greater
during a cognitive task [25]. Many studies have performed
NFT with alpha protocol comprising of different numbers
of sessions and electrodes [26] and have shown enhancement in cognitive performance [8] [27], and improvement
in cognitive processing speed and executive function [28].
While most of the above studies may have not focused on
the alpha activity at frontal regions, a recent study performed
NFT at frontal regions and directly explored its effects on the
attentional control using the Stroop task [29].

The response-conflict theory is a widely used theory that
accounts for an impressive range of findings on attentional
control [29], demonstrated using different cognitive tasks
such as the Stroop task [1]. Individuals with better attentional control will easily resolve the congruency effect. This
suggests that the influence of the task irrelevant information
will be lower. To measure the functional connectivity changes
related to attentional control before and after NFT, Stroop
EEG is analyzed in the current study. We recorded EEG
while healthy individuals performed the Stroop task before
and after NFT. Therefore, the goal of this study is to explore
whether attentional control related differences associated
with NFT would be reflected in brain connectivity.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
1) Participants

50 participants (19 females) were registered from different
faculties and departments of Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia, via an online registration form advertised
through email. The participants included were undergraduate
students, postgraduate students and staff/faculty members.
They were equally divided into two groups, NFT group and
control group, each containing 25 participants. However, one
participant in the control group did not continue the participation to the end of the experiment. Therefore, that participant
is excluded from the final analysis. Prior to advertising, the
study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of
the university.Before starting the experiment, all participants
performed a one-to-one interview with the researcher and it
is confirmed that they are healthy and have no psychological
problems. The age range was 18y to 38y (mean=24.66 and
SD=4.89). An informed consent was obtained from each
participant and the procedures were explained to them. They
voluntarily participated in the study. The experimental procedure was performed in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki.
2) Neurofeedback set-up

The NFT protocol is designed and implemented using a
free and open source software for brain-computer interfaces,
called OpenVibe [30]. The power values within the alpha
band (8-13Hz) from the frontal EEG electrodes are computed
in real-time. A five second sliding window was used for
power computation which is updated each second. This value
is shown to the participants in the form of a vertical bar
graph, as feedback. The vertical bar is designed in the 3D
game designing software, Unity® [31] using visual studio
version 13 (VS13). Both programs, OpenVibe and Unity® are
connected using Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) networking protocol. The bar is updated every second. The data acquisition
and processing is controlled from the researcher’s computer
(Acer swift, 8GB ram, Windows 10 OS, 13.5 inch native
display). The participants viewed the bar on a 17-inch LCD
monitor as an extended display connected to the researcher’s
computer. The complete neurofeedback set-up is shown in
Fig. 1.

3) Nerofeedback training sessions

Each participant in the NFT group had to undergo a total
of 600 minutes long-term neurofeedback training divided
into 20 sessions. Each session was 30 minutes long and
sub-divided into two 15 minutes sub-sessions. Each subject
performed one training session per day and a maximum of

three sessions per week. Before starting each NFT session the
researcher instructed the participants to voluntarily increase
the height of the feedback bar (i.e. vertical red bar in Fig. 1)
by adopting their own strategy. They were also asked to
keep the eyes open while looking the bar and minimize the
eye blinking. The complete training lasted for approximately

2.5 months for each participant. Each participant performed
the Stroop test at the beginning of the training and at the
end of the training. The participants in the control group
also performed the Stroop test twice. To compare the effect
of training in an unbiased manner in terms of timing, the
second attempt by the control group was carried out about
2.5 months after the first attempt. They performed the first
attempt and then waited for the required time for the second
attempt. They did not go through any intervention during the
waiting period.
4) Stroop task structure

The computer version of the Stroop color and word test is
performed by each participant. The structure of the stimulus
presented is shown in Fig. 2. The stimulus presentation and
response logging are carried out by the Psychology Experiment Software toolbox E-Prime (E-Prime V3.0). A 17-inch
LCD display and a wireless keyboard are used for stimulus
presentation and recording the response respectively.
Stimuli for the stroop color and word test were four different color names in English; green, red, yellow and blue,
presented on a light grey background. The word presented
is always written in one of the colors mentioned. Two conditions are embedded in the stimulus structure, congruent
and incongruent. In the congruent condition the word and its
color is matching (e.g. GREEN is written in green color).
In the Incongruent condition, the word and its color do not
match (e.g. GREEN is written in red color). The participants
are required to identify the color of the word and press the
corresponding color key (1, 2, 3 or 4 for green, red, yellow
and blue respectively). The participants were required to
respond within 1000ms of the stipulated time of the stimulus
presentation. Each stimulus is followed by response feedback
(500ms) and a fixation (1000ms). In order to avoid the
priming effects initiated by the congruency effect [32], the
stimuli are presented in pseudo-random order [2].
5) Task procedure

Participants performed the test individually in a quiet room
with proper illumination. The researcher first gave the instructions to the participants. The participants were instructed
to respond as quickly and as accurately as possible. The test
started with eight practice trials. The stimuli in the practice
trials were neutral words (i.e XXXX). The real test trials
begin after the practice trials were finished. A total of 120
trials were presented (50% congruent + 50% incongruent).
After each response, a feedback on the response time for the
trial completed and average accuracy of all the performed
trials is provided as shown in Figure 3(A).
6) EEG acquisition and pre-processing

The Emotiv Epoc+ wireless neuro-headset consists of 16
channels (14 active and 2 reference), and is used to acquire
the EEG data while the participant is performing the task.
Emotiv Epoc+ is very convenient to set up, in addition Emotiv Epoc+ is found to be one of the best consumer grade EEG

devices that can be used reliably for BCI applications, such
as neurofeedback training [11]. An earlier study performed
a successful classification of EEG signals in real-time obtained during a mental arithmetic cognitive task using Emotiv
Epoc+ [33]. Similarly, the functional connectivity analysis
performed on the EEG data recorded with this device has
shown notable hemispheric lateralization during an emotion
experiment [34]. The active electrodes of Emotiv Epoc+ are
positioned on the scalp at AF3, F3, F7, FC5, T7, P7, O1,
O2, P8, T8, FC6, F8, F4 and AF4 according to the 1020 international system standard. Signals from the frontal
region (frontal sensors F7, F3, F4 and F8) were used for the
feedback. The reference electrodes are positioned at the left
and right mastoid bone behind the ears (P3 and P4 location).
The data was recorded with the EmotivPro (data acquisition
software) at a sampling rate of 128 samples/second. The data
is filtered offline by 0.1 Hz high pass filter to remove the
slow drift from the data and a 40 Hz low pass filter using
the EEGLAB toolbox [35] with Hamming windowed sinc
FIR filter of default option of transition band width. After
that, continuous data was epoched to trials from -300ms
to 1200ms around the stimulus onset (0ms) resulting in a
1500ms epoch length.
Firstly, the data is plotted in the eeglab GUI and each
epoch is inspected visually for artefacts. Trials containing
muscle artefacts and eye blinks are identified visually and
removed from the data. Secondly, we apply the independent
component analysis [35] method to eliminate the independent components (ICs) that are associated with non-brain
activity. Because of its reliability in identifying the stereotyped artefacts [17] and improved detection of sub Gaussian
shaped sources [36], we also used the Infomax algorithm for
ICA decomposition. The artefacted components associated
with non-brain activity were identified with an automatic
algorithm, ADJUST [37]. The algorithm uses artefact specific features, identified by the joint contribution of temporal
and spatial characteristics and has been validated previously
[37]. The components selected by ADJUST were removed
from the data. The EEG data is finally reconstructed without
these components. Furthermore, the first eight trials (practice
trials) for each subject were excluded from the analysis. The
average number of trials per participant included in the final
analysis from the NFT group was 107 (Pre-NFT session) and
105.84 (Post-NFT sessions) and control group was 112.875
(Pre-NFT session) and 107.291 (Post-NFT sessions).
To attenuate the volume conduction artefacts from the
data before the connectivity analysis, we applied the Laplacian filter. Several previous functional connectivity studies
have also proved that Laplace transform renders the EEG
data appropriate for connectivity analysis [38], [39]. Surface
Laplacian is a spatial filter to attenuate the low spatial frequencies that can potentially contaminate the EEG signal
to volume conduction artefact. It is therefore appropriate
to apply Laplacian to the EEG data before performing the
connectivity analysis [40].

7) Time-Frequency decomposition

The non-stationary nature of the EEG signal is the key
motivation for the time-frequency (TF) decomposition of
the signal. In TF decomposition, the power spectrum of
the signal is computed over short time windows, which are
considered roughly stationary [41]. Different methods, e.g.
Fourier transform, complex wavelet convolution and Hilbert
transform, can be used to perform TF decomposition. We
used Morlet wavelet convolution method due to its optimal
trade-off between temporal and spectral precision which is
the key parameter in TF analysis [41]. A complex Morlet
wavelet (cmw) is defined by multiplying a sine wave with
a Gaussian as in equation 1;
2

cmw = ei2πf t e(−t

/(2σ 2 ))

(1)

where t is the time, f is the frequency which is defined
from 1-30Hz in 40 logarithmically spaced intervals, σ is a
parameter called full width at half maximum (FWHM) and is
defined by equation 2;
F W HM =

n
2πf

(2)

where n is the number of wavelet cycles, which are varied
from 3 to 8 in 40 log spaced intervals
8) Power computation

The single trial EEG is convolved with complex Morlet
wavelet that results in a complex output. The instantaneous
power for each trial is computed as the square of the complex
convolution Z (power = real[z(t)]2 + img[z(t)]2 ). The
average power is computed by taking the mean across all the
trials. For each time-frequency bin the power values from 300ms to -100ms (where 0ms is the stimulus onset) is used
for baseline correction. Finally, for power law compensation,
baseline normalization is performed. In baseline normalization the power values at each time-frequency point is divided
by the baseline power and converted to a decibel scale using
equation 3;
normalized power = 10 log10 (power/baseline)

(3)

where the average power from -300ms to -100ms preceding stimulus served as baseline.
9) Connectivity measurement

To measure the functional connectivity between the brain
regions, we computed the Inter-Site Phase Clustering (ISPC)
[42], [43]. ISPC measures the phase angle differences between two electrodes j and k at each time-frequency point
and then averaged across all the trials. In this way, a similarity measure for the relative phases between the EEG data
across two different channels over many repetitive trials is
estimated in terms of phase synchronization [44]. The ISPC
computation is given in equation 4;

n

ISP C =|

1 X i(φjt −φkt )
e
|
n i=1

(4)

where n represents the total number of EEG trials in the
data. The phase angles φj and φk of the EEG signal at
electrodes j and k respectively are extracted from the result of
Morlet convolution of TF decomposition. We first obtained a
series of phase angles for each trial at each time-frequency
point for all electrodes. Then, the relative phases between
each of the two electrodes were measured by computing
the phase angle difference between them; (φjt − φkt ).
Finally, the ISPC values are estimated by equation 4. The
ISPC values range from 0 (no synchronization) to 1 (perfect
synchronization).
III. DATA ANALYSIS PROCEDURE
1) EEG data (power analysis)

To explore the neurofeedback related power changes in different EEG bands, we tried to maximize the observations by
focusing our analysis on the time-frequency range where the
stimulus related power changes were maximum. The findings
of previous research studies, related to conflict processing,
revealed that there is a conflict related modulation at the early
time stages, followed by a response related modulation at the
later time stages of the stimuli [45]. Based on these outcomes,
we chose two time windows after stimulus presentation, an
early time window (100-500ms) and a later time window
(500-800ms). Within these time windows, we undertook
the following procedure for the analysis. First, we created
topographical plots for each time window, separated for
previous-to-current trial types. Then we combined the trial
types for alternation and repetition trials in both windows.
Next, we selected the electrode(s) with maximum activation
in both time windows. Then, the time-frequency plots for
these electrode(s) are obtained, separated for alternation and
repetition trials. Based on visual observation of these timefrequency plots, a time-frequency window with the highest
power changes is selected. This window is marked as a black
rectangle in the time-frequency (TF) plots (e.g. in Figure 5F
and 5G). To avoid any bias in the results, the selection of the
TF window was based on the group averaged (i.e average
of pre-training and post-training) TF data. Therefore, the
selection was independent of any specific group. Next, within
this time-frequency window, the peak time-frequency (TF)
point for each subject is found. Now, a sub window, 50ms
around the peak point is selected for each subject. Within this
sub-window, if the TF point reached a threshold, it is included
in computing mean power within sub-window, otherwise not.
The threshold was set to 50% of the peak TF value for each
subject. The condition specific (i.e alternation or repetition)
mean power within the sub-window is computed for each
subject and exported for statistical analysis. Following this
approach, the peak TF point for each subject was preserved.
We repeated the above procedure for theta (4-8Hz), alpha (813Hz) and beta (13-30Hz) bands.

2) EEG data (connectivity analysis)

Similar to power analysis, we choose the same early (100500ms) and late (500-800ms) time windows and we performed the analysis on alternation and repetition trials separately. First, we computed all-to-all synchronization (connectivity) matrices. To inspect these matrices, we followed
one of the myriad approaches that falls under the graph theory (an extensive mathematical framework for dealing with
graphs and networks). We binarized these matrices using a
threshold and computed the node degree for each electrode.
the threshold is chosen in such a way that the node degree for
any of the nodes did not exceed five (which is a reasonable
value in case of 14 channels EEG signal). We started with
an initial threshold of 10% above the median value. This
algorithm is implemented iteratively for each connection in
the connectivity matrix. Thus, if the classified connections
resulted in more than five (node degree), a more liberal
threshold was obtained by repeating the above procedure
(increased by 5% above median value). This resulted in a
threshold of 20% above the median value in the theta and
alpha band and 40% above the median value in the beta
band. Based on the node degree, we selected the electrode
that acts as a hub (i.e with maximum node degree). Next,
for the hub electrode the seeded connectivity is computed
(i.e the synchronization from the hub electrode to all other
electrodes). Then, the electrodes that have maximum node
strength (i.e maximum synchronization with hub electrode)
are selected. To avoid the electrodes that have maximum
node strength due to the spurious synchronization caused
by volume conduction, we selected the electrodes that are
spatially located in other lobe of the brain than the lobe where
the hub electrode is located. Then, the ISPC time frequency
maps for the electrodes that have maximum synchronization
with hub electrode are obtained. Finally, a time-frequency
window is chosen for statistical analysis. The procedure
for selecting this time-frequency window was identical to
power TF window (as explained above). We repeated the
above procedure for theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-13Hz) and beta
(14-30Hz) EEG bands. Brain networks are visualized using
MATLAB based connectivity toolbox called Braph [46].
3) Analysis of variance (ANOVA)

There are two task sessions (i.e Pre-NFT and Post-NFT) and
multiple trials in each session. Each trail has a stimulus congruency condition that is always presented by previous-tocurrent-trial fashion (e.g. cC). In current study there are four
types of congruency conditions; cC (means previous trial was
congruent and current trial is also congruent), iC (previous:
incongruent, current: congruent), iI (previous: incongruent,
current: incongruent) and cI (previous: congruent, current:
incongruent). Therefore, a 2(session: Pre-NFT vs. Post-NFT)
x 4(congruency: iC vs. cI vs. cC vs. iI) two-way repeated
measure ANOVA (RMA) is conducted to study the training
effect, as well as the effects produced by the congruency
conditions. If there is a main effect due to the congruency
condition, the Tukey test is conducted to perform the post-

hoc analysis. The same ANOVA model is used to investigate
the changes in behavioral responses (i.e. RT and RA), power
and ISPC changes in the theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-13HZ) and
beta (14-30Hz) bands.
IV. RESULTS
A. BEHAVIORAL RESULTS

Behavioral results, response time (RT) and response accuracy
(RA), are shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3 and onwards the trial
type represents stimulus congruency conditions (i.e. cC, iC,
cI or iI). The general effect of the Stroop interference (i.e
congruency effect: diverting the attention by the task irrelevant features) was consistent with the previous literature and
the mean response time for congruent stimuli were faster as
compared to incongruent stimuli in both groups, NFT group
and control group. For the NFT group, the results of twoway RMA show that there was a significant main effect of
training [F (1, 24) = 14.932, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.384]
and congruency type [F (3, 72) = 11.659 , p < 0.001,
ηp2 = 0.327] on participant response time. On the other hand
the ANOVA results revealed that there was no significant
main effect of training [F (1, 23) = 0.002 , p < 0.968,
ηp2 = 0.000] and congruency [F (3, 69) = 1.506 , p < 0.221,
ηp2 = 0.061] in the control group.
The overall (i.e. average of pre-NFT and post-NFT sessions) shows that responses were slightly more accurate on
congruent trials as compared to incongruent trials in both
groups, NFT group (congruent: 95.7%, incongruent: 94.6%)
and control group (congruent: 91.2%, incongruent: 89.1%).
However, the ANOVA results revealed that there was no
significant main effect of training as well as congruency in
both groups, NFT group (Training: [F (1, 24) = 0.253 , p <
0.619, ηp2 = 0.010] and Congruency: [F (3, 72) = 1.054,
p < 0.374, ηp2 = 0.042]) and control group (Training:
[F (1, 23) = 0.001, p < 0.976, ηp2 = 0.000] and Congruency: [F (3, 69) = 1.198, p < 0.317, ηp2 = 0.050]).
B. EEG RESULTS
1) Theta power

Theta band power increases are observed for previous-tocurrent-trial type, separately for early time window (100500ms) and later time window (500-800ms). In the early
time window, the task related changes in theta power were
high on the frontal-occipital areas in the iC condition (the
power peaks are around F3, F4, O1 and O2) and on right
temporal-frontal and occipital areas for the cI condition.
Task related theta power increase was observed at frontotemporal areas (spatial peaks around F7, F8 and T8) in the
early time window and at right temporal in late time window
(spatial peaks around T8) for cC condition. For iI congruency
conditions, theta power was spread over the right brain in
both time windows as shown in Fig. 4A.
In general, we compared theta power in the pre-stimulus
(baseline time) to the congruency alternation (iC+cI) and
congruency repetition (cC+iI). We found that theta power
was higher at right anterior-frontal and occipital sites for

congruency alternation, as shown from the spatial peaks
around AF4 and O2 in Fig. 4B and Fig. 4C. On the other
hand, for congruency repetition, the task related changes in
theta power were pronounced on the left anterior-frontal and
temporal areas (Fig. 4D & Fig. 4E, spatial peaks around AF3
and T8).
As can be seen from Fig. 4H1, the NFT group theta
power is higher for the Post-NFT than Pre-NFT session
in all conditions: iC, cI, cC and iI. The increase in theta
power for the Post-NFT session in NFT group was greater
in repetition trials as compared to alternation trials as shown
in Fig. 4H2. A 2x4 RMA show a marginally significant
main effect of training [F (1, 24) = 1.695, p = 0.205,
ηp2 = 0.066]. The main effect of congruency was significant
[F (3, 72) = 5.936, p = 0.001, ηp2 = 0.198]. On the other
hand, theta power for the control group is lower in the PostNFT session as compared to Pre-NFT session as shown in
Fig. 4I1 & Fig. 4I2. However, similar to NFT group the
ANOVA results revealed that the main effect of training was
also not significant for control group [F (1, 23) = 0.664,
p = 0.423, ηp2 = 0.028]. But the main effect of the congruency condition was significant [(3, 72) = 5.437, p = 0.002,
ηp2 = 0.191]. These results indicate that the processing
of stimulus information is driven by congruency alternation
in the anterior-frontal and occipital areas and congruency

repetition in the frontal-temporal areas. In addition, theta
power in these areas in the NFT group is modulated mainly
by stimulus congruency conditions.
2) Alpha power

Similar to theta power, changes in alpha power were also
observed in early time window (100-500ms) and later time
window (500-800ms) for previous-to-current trial type separately. When a congruent trial is presented immediately
after incongruent trials (i.e. iC condition) or an incongruent
trial is presented immediately after congruent trial (i.e. cI
condition), task related alpha power was high in frontal and
parietal areas in both time windows, early and late. On the
other hand, the task related increase in the alpha power for
cC and iI conditions was spread over the entire brain in both
time windows as shown in Fig. 5A.
Collectively, in both time windows, the change in alpha
power was high in the frontal areas for both, alternation as
shown in Fig. 5B & Fig. 5C and repetition as shown in
Fig. 5D & Fig. 5E. In both time windows, the spatial peaks
are observed around the frontal sites (F3 & F4). Based on the
above observations, separate TF plots from the frontal areas
(F3 & F4) are obtained for congruency alternation as shown
in Fig. 5F and repetition as shown in Fig. 5G.
The mean values in the selected electrode-time-frequency

regions (the black rectangle in TF plots) are analyzed using
RMA between different congruency conditions, as well as
Pre- and Post-NFT sessions, separately in NFT group and
control group. For the NFT group, it can be seen from
Fig. 5H1 that changes in task related alpha power were higher
in the Post-NFT session in all conditions (i.e. iC, cI, cC,
iI). Similar to theta power, the increase in NFT group alpha
power was stronger in congruency repetition than congruency
alternation, as shown in Fig. 5H2. The results of ANOVA
show that there is no significant main effect of training
[F (1, 24) = 2.374, p = 0.136, ηp2 = 0.090]. However,
the main effect of the congruency condition was significant
[F (3, 72) = 2.99, p = 0.036, ηp2 = 0.111]. On the other
hand, the control group did not show a consistent pattern in
alpha power changes. The control group alpha power in the

Post-NFT session decreased in iC and cI conditions while
a small increase is observed in the cC condition. The control
group alpha power was nearly equal in iI condition in the Preand Post-NFT sessions as shown in Fig. 5I1. Collectively,
alpha power was decreased in alternation trials and slightly
increased in repetition trials as shown in Fig. 5I2. However, ANOVA shows no significant main effect of training
[F (1, 23) = 0.85, p = 0.773, ηp2 = 0.004] but the main
effect of congruency was significant [F (3, 69) = 7.207,
p = 0.000, ηp2 = 0.239]. These results indicate that the
processing of stimulus information increases alpha power in
frontal areas. Additionally, the effect size (i.e. ηp2 = 0.090)
from the NFT group ANOVA results indicated that the alpha
power was marginally increased by the training in frontal
areas as on the other hand, the control group did not show

any such increase.
3) Beta power

Task related changes in beta power were high in the occipital
areas for iC condition in both time windows. For cI condition,
the changes were spread over the right brain as shown in
Fig. 6A. High beta power is observed in the right temporal
and occipital areas in the early time window (spatial peaks
around O2 and T8 shown in Fig. 6A) and the parietal and
occipital areas in the later time window for cC condition.
Finally, in the iI condition, task related beta change was
centered in the right parietal and occipital areas as shown
in Fig. 6A. Together for congruency alternation trials (i.e.
iC and cI), task related beta increase was higher in the right
occipital area (spatial peak around O2) in both time windows,
early (100-500 ms) and late (500-800 ms) as shown in Fig. 6B

and Fig. 6C. Whereas, for congruency repetition (i.e. cC and
iI), the task related beta power was high in the occipital area
(spatial peak around O1 as shown in Fig. 6D) in the early
time window and occipital and temporal areas (spatial peaks
around O2 and T8) in late time window as shown in Fig. 6E.
Based on the above observations, collectively for both time
windows, the TF plots for these electrode-time-frequency
regions are obtained as shown in Fig. 6F and Fig. 6G and
statistical analysis is performed on the selected TF region
(Black rectangle in TF plots) separately for NFT group and
control group. Beta power was nearly equal in the Pre- and
Post-NFT sessions in the NFT group as shown in Fig. 6H1
& Fig. 6H2. Similarly, beta power in the control group was
also almost equal in the Pre- and Post-NFT sessions in cI,
cC and iI condition except iC condition where the control
group showed a decrease as shown in Fig. 6I1. Due to the

decrease in iC condition the beta power in the alternation trial
was lower in the Post-NFT session than Pre-NFT as shown
in Fig. 6I2. Two-way RMA shows no significant main effect
of training in both groups, NFT group [F (1, 24) = 0.024,
p = 0.878, ηp2 = 0.001] and control group [F (1, 23) =
0.312, p = 0.582, ηp2 = 0.013]. However, the main effect
of congruency condition was significant in both groups, NFT
group [F (3, 72) = 11.112, p < 0.000, ηp2 = 0.316] and
control group [F (3, 69) = 4.020, p = 0.011, ηp2 = 0.149].
4) Fronto-pareital theta ISPC

All-to-all synchronization in theta band revealed an increase
in frontal connectivity relative to baseline in both time
windows (early: 100-500ms and late: 500-800ms) and congruency conditions, alternation and repetition, as shown in

Fig. 7A. In Alternation trials, the connectivity degree was
high at the left frontal areas (spatial peaks observed at F3)
in both time windows. On the other hand, for repetition trials
and early time window, the highest connectivity degree was
equally observed in the left frontal (F3) and temporal (T7)
sites. While in the late time window the highest connectivity
degree was observed in temporal (T7) site in repetition trials.
Based on the above quantitative inspection, seed-to-all
connections from F3 (the “seed” electrode) are computed for
alternation and repetition as shown in Fig. 7B. In the sessionaveraged TF data, the “seed” electrode was maximally connected with the parietal areas (P7 & P8) in alternation trials
and parietal area (P8) in repetition trials (Note: to avoid
spurious connections that might be produced by volume
conduction, we looked for the maximum seed connections

in areas other than frontal as it is the seed area). These
electrodes are used as a region of interest (ROI) for plotting
the TF maps as shown in Fig. 7C & Fig. 7D.
Relative to baseline, a maximum connectivity increase for
alternation trials was observed in 20-220ms and for repetition
trials in 30-180ms in the fronto-parietal ROI (represented
by black rectangle in the TF maps, Fig. 7C and Fig. 7D).

Two-way RMA are applied on these TF-electrode regions
separately for NFT group and control group.
The fronto-pareital ISPC was modulated in the NFT group
in the iC, cI and cC congruency conditions as there was an
increase in the Post-NFT session connectivity as shown in
Fig. 8A1. However, in the iI congruency condition, ISPC was
almost equal in Pre- and Post-NFT sessions in the control
group. From ANOVA, there was a significant main effect
of training [F (1, 24) = 4.413, p = 0.046, ηp2 = 0.155].
The main effect of the congruency condition was also significant in the NFT group [F (3, 72) = 33.176, p < 0.000,
ηp2 = 0.580]. On the other hand, the ISPC values in the
control group for all the congruency conditions (iC, cI, cC,
and iI) were nearly equal in Pre- and Post-NFT sessions
as shown in Fig. 8A2. The main effect of the training was
also not significant in the control group [F (1, 23) = 0.151,
p = 0.701, ηp2 = 0.007]. However, the congruency condition shows a significant main effect in the control group
[F (3, 69) = 40.565, p < 0.000, ηp2 = 0.638]. These results
suggest that the increase in the fronto-parietal connectivity
was truly produced by the training.
5) Fronto-pareital alpha ISPC

All electrodes to all other electrodes connectivity in the alpha
band was high in the frontal areas in both time windows
and both congruency conditions, alternation and repetition as
shown in Fig. 9A. The maximum connectivity degree was
observed at F4 sites in both time windows for alternation

in both time windows and congruency conditions, alternation
and repetition. Therefore, these electrodes are chosen as ROI
for plotting TF maps.
Relative to the pre-stimulus baseline, an increase in ISPC
was observed in 20-200ms in alternation trials and 280-500
ms in repetition trials. These regions are represented by the
black rectangles in the TF plots in Fig. 9C and Fig. 9D
for alternation and repetition trials respectively. These TFelectrodes ROI was used for ISPC analyses.

trials. Similarly, for repetition trials, the max connectivity was also observed at F4 site in the late time window.
However, in the late time window F4 was the second most
connected site. Hence, F4 is chosen as the “seed” region and
then seed-to-all other electrodes connections are computed
as shown in Fig. 9B. Similar to theta ISPC, the seed region
was maximally connected with the parietal areas (P7 and P8)

Fronto-parietal alpha ISPC in the NFT group was modulated by neurofeedback training as ISPC was high in PostNFT session in all congruency conditions, iC, cI, cC and iI
as shown in Fig. 10A1 & Fig. 10A2. However, the ISPC in
control group was lower in the Post-NFT session than PreNFT as shown in Fig. 10B1 & Fig. 10B2. In the NFT group
a significant main effect was observed from both factors,
training [F (1, 24) = 8.073, p = 0.009, ηp2 = 0.252]
and congruency [F (3, 72) = 47.791, p < 0.000, ηp2 =
0.666]. On the other hand, in the control group the main
significant effect was observed only by congruency condition
[F (3, 69) = 48.644, p < 0.000, ηp2 = 0.679] and not by the
training factor [F (1, 23) = 2.552, p = 0.124, ηp2 = 0.100].
These results suggest that the increase in alpha ISPC in the
NFT group was driven by training as this effect was absent in
the control group.

6) Temporal-frontal beta ISPC

Maximum inter-site phase clustering (ISPC) for allelectrodes to all other electrodes in beta band was observed
in temporal (T7) site in both time windows for alternation
trials as shown in Fig. 11A. Similarly, for repetition trials
the maximum connectivity in the early time window was
observed at temporal (T7) site as shown in Fig. 11A. However, in the late time window, the maximum connections were

found equally at temporal (T7) and frontal (F3) for repetition
trials, as shown in Fig. 11A. Based on these observations, T7
is chosen as the seed electrode and seed-to-all connections
are obtained, as shown in Figure 12(B). To avoid spurious
connectivity that might be produced by volume conduction,
the connection between T7 and its immediate next electrodes
were avoided. Therefore, AF4 and P8 are chosen which have
maximum connectivity with the seed electrode (Fig. 11B).
This resulted in temporal-frontal-parietal areas (i.e. T7, AF4
and P8) as ROI for TF-maps.
From TF maps, it is observed that the baseline relative beta
ISPC was high in 10-160 ms in alternation trials and 220520 ms in repetition trials, as shown by black rectangles in
Fig. 11C and Fig. 11D. The ISPC values within these TF
windows are plotted separately for NFT and control group in
Fig. 12A & Fig. 122 and Fig. 12B1 & Fig. 12B2 respectively.
It is clear that beta ISPC was decreased in NFT group in
all congruency conditions in the Post-NFT session except in
cC condition where the ISPC was slightly greater in the PostNFT session as shown in Fig. 12A1. Collectively for alternation and repetition the ISPC is decreased in both, alternation
and repetition as shown in Fig. 12A2. ANOVA result revealed
no main significant effect of training [F (1, 24) = 2.439,
p = 0.131, ηp2 = 0.092] and a significant main effect of
congruency [F (3, 72) = 94.067, p < 0.000, ηp2 = 0.797].
On the other hand, ISPC in control group is slightly greater in
all congruency condition in Post-NFT than Pre-NFT sessions
as shown in Fig. 12B1. However, ANOVA revealed no significant effect of training factor [F (1, 23) = 0.147, p = 0.705,

condition [F (3, 69) = 69.057, p < 0.000, ηp2 = 0.750]. The
results suggest no significant effect of training on the beta
connection between temporal-frontal-parietal regions.
V. DISCUSSION

The goal of this study was to explore the effects of longterm neurofeedback training to assess cognitive performance
(specifically response conflict performance) in healthy participants. Primarily, real-time neurofeedback training was
provided in the alpha band (8-13Hz) and the offline EEG
analysis was performed in theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-13Hz)
and beta bands (14-30Hz). The participants showed improvements in the processing speed of the response conflict task
(Stroop test), as indicated by significant faster RT in the NFT
group.
Although, the neurofeedback training was provided in
alpha band, it was observed that the training was able to
modulate both alpha and theta band activity in the EEG
signal, reflected in the theta and alpha band powers in the
NFT group. Whereas, no such increase was observed in the
control group. As in our study, the analysis were based on
a specific time-frequency (TF) ROI. Therefore, it should be
noted that increase in alpha and/or theta band EEG activity
in a specific TF window may have beneficial effects in the
response conflict processing. Regarding the alpha activity,
our results are in line with the existing literature. The earlier
studies showed that neurofeedback training provided an increase in the relative alpha power [47]. Moreover, the earlier
neurophysiological studies for working memory [48] and
episodic memory [14] have demonstrated enhanced cognitive
processing in participants that have more frontal alpha power.
Thus, the concentration of the alpha power in the frontal
areas of the brain demonstrated more enhanced cognitive
processing in our results.
The results documented in the current study elaborate on
the possible changes in EEG band power underlying the processing of response conflict in cognitive control. In addition
to the training band (i.e. alpha band), the examination of
other frequency bands in our study, especially theta band
(4-8Hz) and beta band (14-30Hz) expand on the effects
of training on the non-training bands. These bands are the
preferred protocol parameters for conducting neurofeedback
training as mentioned in [47]. In the previous literature, theta
band activity has shown a strong role during attention and
cognitive control tasks [49] [50]. Also, theta band activity
has shown an association with working memory [51] and a
high theta activity may increase response conflict processing.
The most attractive finding of the current study is that
the training effects in the theta band and alpha band are
similar. Although, the training provided is primarily in the
alpha band, a continuous increase in theta band power is also
observed after training. Similar results are reported in [52]
and they demonstrated a significant cognitive improvement
as measured by matrix rotation task [52]. In addition to the
frontal areas, an increase in the theta activity at stimulus

contralateral posterior sites (Fig. 4F) reflected processing of
the visual features that are embedded in the stimulus. Similar
results are reported in earlier findings that theta band activity
was increased at posterior areas due to the processing of
stimulus spatial features [53]. Of novelty is the extension of
the earlier finding that theta band power is modulated at the
early stage after stimulus presentation in the parietal areas
[2]. Our findings revealed that this modulation varied in the
context of preceding trial congruency condition and is more
pronounced in the congruency alternation (Fig. 4H2). This
suggests that the processing of the task relevant and irrelevant
features affect the response conflict ability at early stages.
Fronto-parietal connectivity in theta band indicated a shift
in the fronto-pareital network from the stimulus-contralateral
posterior sites in a previous-to-current-trial-congruency context. For both, alternation and repetition trials, this shift appeared immediately after stimulus onset (alternation: Fig. 7C,
20-220ms; repetition: Fig. 7D, 30-180ms). This increase in
the early stage connectivity in the fronto-parietal network
may reflect a faster response conflict resolution. Also, it
can be inferred that this resolution is independent of the
adaptation to the preceding trial congruency and was similar
for alternation and repetition. Our findings indicate that,
overall in theta band, fronto-parietal connectivity increased
after neurofeedback training in the NFT group, which is not
observed in the control group. In general, this effect indicates
that neurofeedback training was effective for healthy participants and is able to increase their cognitive control to resolve
response conflict efficiently.
Besides the interesting response-conflict-processing effects in theta band network, phase synchronization in the
alpha band between pre-NFT and post-NFT sessions also
showed superior connectivity in the post-NFT session in
the NFT group. The connectivity increase in the post-NFT
session between frontal and stimulus contralateral posterior
sites (P7 & P8) reflects a strong visual perception to the
stimulus visual features. The strong visual perception indicates better cognitive ability to integrate the sensory input
to visual system located in the visual cortex. The visual
attention was tested by a spatial orienting task [2] and it is
reported that fronto-parietal connection reflect better visual
attention. Therefore, the increase in fronto-parietal connectivity after neurofeedback training in the NFT group indicate
that participants were able to enhance their visual attention
by neurofeedback training. Our finding suggest that the modulation of stimulus contralateral band-specific connectivity,
related to conflict resolution, also occurs in bands other than
theta [45] [54].
In the NFT group beta band, the presence of a weaker
phase locking in the temporal-frontal-parietal sites after
training is observed (Fig. 10A1 & Fig. 10A2). Whereas, a
small increase was observed for the control group (Fig. 10B1
& Fig. 10B2). Contrary to our results, previous literature
showed stronger beta phase locking for old people in agerelated differences [55]. One explanation of our results is that
the decrease in the beta band connections reflects a lower

cognitive load after training. It suggests that the amount
of cognitive resources required for conflict processing is
decreased, indicating a faster response-conflict processing.
To achieve response-conflict resolution, the brain needs to
activate more beta connections during the task performance
before NFT.
The response conflict feature embedded in our stimulus
structure (e.g. incongruent stimuli) requires a higher level
of cognition and requires the participants to think. Our results could be supported by one of the recent neuroimaging
studies explaining task performance in relation to functional
connectivity in different age groups [56]. Although their
study primarily revealed age-related differences, their results
suggested that increased functional brain connection relates
to lower task performance.
Hence, our findings suggests that NFT-related differences
in response-conflict task performance shows increased cognitive control adjustment after NFT. Additionally, it points
to cognitive flexibility, one of the key abilities of high task
performers, is being facilitated by the training per se.
VI. CONCLUSION

In the current study we used a non-invasive procedure called
neurofeedback training (NFT) on healthy participants and
investigated its effects towards response-conflict resolution.
With the help of high-temporal resolution electrophysiological signals recorded with surface EEG recordings and
employing TF analysis methods, we investigated evidences
of the NFT related differences in normal healthy participants. We explored that alpha power in response-conflict
task indicates training related differences at frontal sites.
Also, theta power shows NFT related changes at anteriofrontal, occipital and temporal sites. Theta and alpha band
phase synchronization between the frontal and parietal areas
of the brain enhanced significantly in the NFT group. This
impact was not found in the control group. This further
highlighted the training effects, indicating that training was
effective to enhance the cognitive control of the participants.
Hence, these findings suggests EEG neurofeedback training
as a positive cognitive enhancement procedure for healthy
adults.However, the participants of the current study were
recruited from the university population. Therefore, it is very
important to consider the generalizability of these findings.
One of the future possible extensions is to explore the current
findings in the healthy people from the general society.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT

We acknowledge and thanks to the participants for their longterm engagement (around 10 weeks for each participant) in
