ABSTRACT
EEG based emotion recognition is the most significant
technique to identify human emotions effectively. An attempt
is made to identify range of frequency bands for each discrete
emotion using frequency band analysis of EEG signals. Each
frequency band is associated with relative power values.
These relative power values assist to estimate range for
frequency bands. The results are evaluated for absolute and
relative power values of EEG signal in each frequency band.
Further, Bayesian network is constructed to represent
relationship between frequency bands and emotion. As a
result, theta and alpha bands found to be more active than beta
and gamma.

1. INTRODUCTION
Electroencephalogram (EEG) based emotion recognition has
speeded up its significance in Human Computer Interaction.
EEG signals represent the vigilance states of brain which
change according to the task performed by a subject. The
change in EEG signals has been classified into different
frequency bands namely; delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma
[1, 2]. The model works on Deep Belief Network (DBN) and
differential entropy features for determining significant
frequency bands in multichannel EEG data for emotion
recognition. The weights of trained DBNs help in finding
critical frequency bands achieving 86.65% accuracy [3].
Visual attention tasks assist frequency band analysis/ power
spectrum analysis of EEG signal using Independent
Component Analysis (ICA) and Principal Component
Analysis (PCA). Visual attention frequency lies in beta band
with maximum power as 10-12 DB and shows the alert state
of subject [4]. Power spectrum of EEG signal includes
functional connectivity patterns such as correlation, coherence
and phase synchronization. Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
(QDA) supports these connectivity patterns to classify
emotion attaining 60% success rate. [5]. Transfer Recursive
Feature Elimination (T-RFE) approach helps to determine the
most robust EEG indicators with stable geometrical
distribution for EEG based emotion recognition in frequency
domain. Linear least square support vector machine using TRFE serves to classify emotions realizing 75.26% and 78.75%
success rate for arousal and valence dimensions respectively
[6]. However, there remains the scope to identify dominant
frequency bands and their relationship with emotion.
With the potential advances in preprocessing of EEG signals,
it has become possible to analyze EEG signals for different
application domains. In this paper, a framework is proposed
for estimating range of frequency bands for each discrete
emotion and their relationship. In Section 2, a systematic
description of aforementioned framework alongside its
theoretical aspects is described. Section 3, deals with the

specification of experimental setup required for proposed
framework with its realization issues. A discussion on results
based on absolute and relative powers of frequency bands is
provided in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 pertains with
conclusion and future scope.

2. PROPOSED FRAMEWORK
Neural patterns in frequency bands provide more objective
measures for assessing emotional states of subject. A
framework is proposed to estimate range of these neural
patterns in frequency bands and to explore their relationship
with emotions and is named as Relative Power Spectrum
based Range Estimation (RPSRE). This work, intends to
identify the neural signature and patterns of brain signals for
happy, sad, and fear emotion. RPSRE framework comprises
of consequent phases namely; input raw EEG signal,
preprocessing, power spectrum analysis, relative power
prediction, range estimation, and relationship representation
as shown in Fig. 1 and are described in brief as follows:

2.1 Input Raw EEG Signal
Raw EEG signals are acquired from different subjects for
diverse emotions and act as input to RPSRE. EEG signals are
obtained from various positions of the brain against specific
stimuli. Stimuli play a vital role in raw EEG signal acquisition
for inducing target emotion to the subject. Various stimuli
such as images, music and movie clips contribute to emotion
elicitation process. The raw EEG signals are to be recorded
against specific region of the brain using electrodes positioned
across the scalp. Several EEG signal capturing devices help to
acquire raw EEG signals. Synchronization between subject,
stimuli, and EEG signal capturing device makes a valuable
contribution to acquire the ongoing emotion related activity in
the brain. The acquired raw EEG signal contains noise and
various artifacts and hence, requires preprocessing.

2.2 Preprocessing
The purpose of preprocessing is to convert raw EEG signals
into the normalized form. Preprocessing techniques help to
remove unwanted artifacts and improve signal to noise ratio.
Various preprocessing techniques such as Butterworth filter,
Notch filter, Adaptive filters, and FIR filter help to preprocess
EEG signal of each emotion and transforms raw EEG signal
into normalized form. Moreover, every EEG signal of each
channel has inherent component with some higher order
statistics. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) methods effectively
contribute for extracting noise free components of EEG
signals [7]. Thus, the preprocessed dataset contains collection
of maximal noise free components of EEG signals.

2.3 Power Spectrum Analysis
Spectral analysis is one of the standard methods used for
quantification of EEG data. The power spectral density (PSD)
reflects the frequency content of the signal or the distribution
of signal power over frequency. In power spectrum analysis,

On the basis of relative power values obtained using Eq. (1),
relative power set Rk is defined for each frequency band for
each emotion as:

Raw EEG Signal

Preprocessing

EEG signals are described in terms of rhythmic activity and
get transformed into frequency bands namely; delta (δ), theta
(θ), alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ) as depicted in Table 1.
The noise free EEG signal in preprocessed dataset requires
power spectrum analysis for frequency bands separation. Fast
Fourier transform and Welch’s methods contribute to perform
power spectral of the noise free signal. These methods convert
time domain EEG signal into frequency domain and divides
the EEG signal into frequency bands as shown in Table 1 [8].
Usually, the power spectrum is analyzed on the basis of
broader frequency bands, which represent the sum of power of
several smaller frequency bands as depicted in Fig. 2. Power
spectrums of all channels are closely intensive and
overlapping hence difficult to analyze. ICA helps to separate
these overlapping components of channels for each frequency
band for emotion analysis. The individual component
provides more accurate reading of activity power spectrum
corresponding to different frequencies for each emotion and
thus helps to analyze EEG signal effectively.

2.4 Relative Power Prediction
Each frequency band of EEG signal extracted in power
spectrum analysis is associated with absolute and relative
power. Absolute power of EEG signal is the sum of power
spectrum density values for each frequency band of EEG
signal in each emotion and is measured in microvolts.
Absolute power of a band expresses integral of all power
values within its frequency range and hence, represents band
power of EEG signal in specific emotion. Maximum absolute
power assists to analyze each EEG frequency band. On the
other hand, relative power is percentage of power in any band
compared with total power of EEG signal in each emotion.
Relative power represents the percentage of signal made up of
oscillations in a particular band. It shows the percentage of
signal accounted by specific band [9]. Relative power for each
extracted frequency band for each emotion is expressed as
follows:

Rk = { Rji,

…….

,RMN }

where i=1, 2, …, N and j=1, 2, …, M

… (2)

where N is the number of channels, M is number of emotion,
and R represents the relative power value of kth frequency
band. Thus, combined feature vector of relative power is
shown in Eq. (3).
… (3)

where Rα, Rβ, Rγ, Rθ denote sets of relative power values for
alpha, beta, gamma, and theta band respectively each of size
(M*N).

2.5 Range Estimation
Arangeis variation in upper and lower limits of particular
feature vector representing EEG signal in each emotion. A
range of the entire group of emotion is included between two
points on a scale of measurement or quality and it helps to
understand the amount of dispersion in the EEG data for

17

Volume 178 – No. 13, May 2019
specific emotion. A large range value indicates greater
dispersion whereas a small range value indicates less
dispersion in the values of EEG features. Here, the range for
each EEG frequency band is based on relative powers using
upper and lower limits of each set Rk in feature vector FRP. It
is essential to identify lower limit l and upper limit u for each
relative power set Rk for range estimation in each emotion.
Each Rk is required to sort it in ascending order of relative
power values. The values of l and u help to specify range as l
to u for each frequency band and for each emotion.

2.6 Relationship Representation using
Bayesian Network
A Bayesian network represents the causal probabilistic
relationship among a set of variables and their conditional
dependences. It consists of directed acyclic graph which
captures qualitative belief structure of distribution and
numerical components which specifies conditional probability
distribution. The relationship between ith frequency band and
each emotion in E is expressed using Bayesian network with
conditional probabilities. Here, frequency bands and each
discrete emotion act as nodes for Bayesian network. Links
represent dependencies between nodes. The conditional
probabilities between each frequency band and emotion are
stated as:
... (4)

where, variable E={e1, e2, ….en} set of emotional states, Fi
represents ith frequency band feature vector with D
elements [10]. The maximum probability value in each
frequency band for each emotion contributes in construction
of Bayesian network.

3. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND
EXECUTION
In order to examine the neural signature of different emotions
and stable pattern over time, an emotion experiment is
designed to collect EEG data. The raw EEG data is captured
from 16 subjects (8 male and 8 female) using EMOTIV EPOC
device for happy, sad and fear emotions. The device uses
sequential sampling method with sampling rate 128 samples
per second and 16 bit analog to digital converter. The
configuration of electrodes positioning in EMOTIV is based
on the International 10-20 system [11]. Implementation of
RPSRE framework is realized on Windows XP using
EEGLAB tool on MATLAB 16A [12].
The input raw EEG signals are captured in .edf format for

each subject from 14 different positions across the brain for
happy, sad and fear emotion. The raw EEG data is
preprocessed using bandpass filter between 0-50Hz for
removing the noise and artifacts in EEG signals. Independent
components are separated for each channel using ICA. A
preprocessed dataset containing EEG data of 16 subjects and
three emotions is formed and is stored in numerical format.
Further, frequency bands (α, β, θ, δ, γ) are estranged using
Welch method for each EEG signal in preprocessed dataset
during power spectrum analysis. Relative power prediction,
range estimation and relationship representation are the main
highlights of our research work in this paper as shown
in Fig. 1.
Relative power prediction phase is concerned with absolute
and relative powers of frequency bands. It works on frequency
bands extracted in power spectrum analysis phase. First,
absolute powers for each EEG frequency band for each of
three emotions are premeditated. The absolute powers are
calculated for different regions of brain along with
combination of electrode pairs using preprocessed EEG
dataset as illustrated in Fig. 3. Next, relative power sets
are constructed using same EEG dataset for 14
channels and three emotions as shown in Table 2. Thus, four
relative power sets corresponding to each frequency band are
gained each of size [14*16*3]. The average relative powers of
all subjects for each set of frequency bands in each emotion
are depicted in Table 2. Delta band is eliminated from
analysis as it contains very low frequencies inducing noise.

Fig. 3: Absolute Powers of EEG Frequency Bands for
Each Emotion
Range estimation phase basically deals with finding the range
for each frequency band using the lower limit (l) and upper
limits (u) of each relative power set. Accordingly, each
relative power set is sorted in ascending order and limits l and
u of each set for each emotion is predicted as shown with
highlighted values in Table 2. Here, the ranges of each
frequency bands are estimated using average relative power of
all subjects in each constructed set. The ranges for each
frequency band for each emotion using relative power sets are
estimated as l to u and are depicted in Table 3. Literature
reveals that frontal, parietal and temporal regions are active in
emotional processing of brain. In this context, channels
corresponding to these regions namely; F7, F8, T7, T8, P7,
and P8 are selected for analysis.

Relationship representation phase appertains with describing
relationships between frequency bands and emotions. This is
accomplished by designing a Bayesian network between
dominant frequency bands and emotion. Happy, sad, fear
emotions and alpha, beta, theta, and gamma bands are
identified as nodes to Bayesian Network. Edges between these
nodes represent relationship between them. Here, each
frequency band is considered as independent node whereas
node corresponding to each emotion acts as dependent node.
The conditional probabilities are calculated based on the
relative power values of each frequency band and emotion as
shown in Fig. 4. The conditional probability distribution is
defined for each node in the network. The highest probability
value of each frequency band for each emotion is utilized for
constructing Bayesian network.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
RPSRE framework is implemented framework against
fourteen different positions of the brain for happy, sad, and
fear emotions. The frequency bands are evaluated on the basis
of absolute and relative powers of EEG signals. In case of
absolute power, the maximum absolute power of frequency
band in each emotion for each combination of electrode pairs
is examined as illustrated in Fig. 3. In relative powers
scenario, we estimate the range using lower and upper limit of
relative powers of each EEG frequency band in specific
emotion. Here, we discuss the observations drawn for
combination of electrode pairs F7 and F8 showing frontal
region, P7 and P8 corresponding to parietal region and T7 and
T8 related to temporal region for happy, sad, and fear
emotions as follows:
Case I: Ranges for Happy emotion
The average maximum absolute power is observed in of theta
band as 76%, 67%, and 66% for F7 and F8, T7 and T8, and
P7 and P8 electrode pairs respectively. The average
ranges estimated using relative powers as per Table 2 are 1.05, 0.9-2, 0.1-1.2, and 8.5-9 for alpha, beta, gamma, and theta
bands respectively for happy emotion in all electrode pairs.
The conditional probabilities shown in Fig. 4 witnessed that
happy emotion is related to activation of alpha and beta bands.
Case II: Ranges for Sad emotion
In case of sad emotion, the average maximum absolute power
is observed in theta band as 80% for F7 and F8, T7 and T8,
whereas 81% for P7 and P8 electrode pairs. The average
ranges estimated using relative powers are 3.5-5, 1.3-1.5, 0.30.8, and 9.0-10 for alpha, beta, gamma, and theta bands

respectively in all electrodes. It is noticed that theta and alpha
bands are responsible for generating sad emotion based on
their CPT values in Fig. 4.
Case III: Ranges for Fear emotion
In this scenario, the average maximum absolute power is
observed again in theta band as 48% for F7 and F8, 55% T7
and T8, whereas 52% for P7 and P8 electrode pairs. However,
the percentage of absolute power in theta band is decreased in
fear emotion and shows more activation in alpha band. The
average ranges estimated using relative powers are 2-3.5, 0.60.9, 10-11, and 7-8.9 for alpha, beta, gamma, and theta bands
respectively in all electrodes. Here, theta and alpha bands are
responsible for generating fear emotion as per probabilities
shown in Bayesian network. Further, the comparison of all
estimated ranges using RPSRE is depicted in Fig. 5. It shows
that there exists significant variation between ranges of each
frequency band for specific emotion.

5. CONCLUSION
A novel RPSRE framework have been proposed for range and
relationship estimation of EEG frequency bands for happy,
sad and fear emotion. The range for each frequency band in
each emotion is predicted using relative powers of EEG
signal. Probabilistic inference using Bayesian network is
utilized to represent relationship between emotion and
frequency bands. It is witnessed that there exist conditional
dependencies between frequency bands and specific emotion
and can be effectively represented using Bayesian network.
Also, an attempt has been to estimate the range and
relationship for frequency bands based on their relative power
values for each emotion. Further, estimated ranges of each
frequency band for different emotion will help to build
effective emotion recognition system.
