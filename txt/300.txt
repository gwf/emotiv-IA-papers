Abstract

22

Many recent studies found signatures of motor learning in neural beta oscillations (13–

23

30Hz), and specifically in the post-movement beta rebound (PMBR). All these studies were in

24

simplified laboratory-tasks in which learning was either error-based or reward-based. Interestingly,

25

these studies reported opposing dynamics of the PMBR magnitude over learning for the error-based

26

and reward-based tasks (increase verses decrease, respectively). Here we explored the PMBR

27

dynamics during real-world motor-skill-learning in a billiards task using mobile-brain-imaging.

28

Our EEG recordings highlight opposing dynamics of PMBR magnitudes between different subjects

29

performing the same task. The groups of subjects, defined by their neural-dynamics, also showed

30

behavioral differences expected for error-based verses reward-based learning. Our results suggest

31

that when faced with the complexity of the real-world different subjects might use different learning

32

mechanisms for the same complex task. We speculate that all subjects combine multi-modal

33

mechanisms of learning, but different subjects have different predominant learning mechanisms.

Introduction

35

While many different forms of motor learning were described and studied using various

36

laboratory-tasks over the past decades (for review see Krakauer et al., 2019), two main learning

37

mechanisms are considered to account for most of our motor learning capabilities: error-based

38

adaptation and reward-based reinforcement learning. Error-based adaptation is driven by sensory-

39

prediction errors, while reward-based learning is driven by reinforcement of successful actions

40

(Haith and Krakauer, 2013; Krakauer and Mazzoni, 2011). While both mechanisms can contribute

41

to learning in any given task, the constrains of the highly controlled laboratory-tasks common in

42

the field induce the predominance of one mechanism over the other, and show different neural

43

dynamics associated with the different learning mechanisms (Palidis et al., 2019; Uehara et al.,

44

2018).

45

A main neural signatures of voluntary movement and motor learning are the beta

46

oscillations (13–30 Hz), which are related to GABAergic activity (Hall et al., 2010, 2011; Roopun

47

et al., 2006; Yamawaki et al., 2008). More specifically, there is transient and prominent increase in

48

beta oscillations magnitude across the sensorimotor network after cessation of voluntary movement

49

known as post-movement beta rebound (PMBR) or post-movement beta synchronization

50

(Pfurtscheller et al., 1996). In motor adaptation studies PMBR was reported to negatively correlate

51

with movement errors, lower errors induced higher PMBR (e.g. Tan et al., 2014, 2016; Torrecillos

52

et al., 2015) and therefore PMBR increases over learning. In reward-based tasks the PMBR shows

53

the opposite trend; e.g., in a force tracking task PMBR decreased with learning (Kranczioch et al.,

54

2008). Additionally, PMBR is positively correlated with GABA concentration as measured by

55

magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Cheng et al., 2017; Gaetz et al., 2011) which also decreases over

56

reward-based learning tasks such as sequence learning in force tracking (Floyer-Lea et al., 2006)

57

and serial reaction time (Kolasinski et al., 2019).

58

Here, we set to study the neurobehavioral dynamics of real-world motor learning, asking

59

to what extent previous findings in laboratory-tasks can be validated in a complex, fully-body task

60

people choose to experience in daily life. We recently introduced a real-world motor-skill learning

61

paradigm in a pool table billiards (Haar et al., 2019). Subjects had to do a pool shot in order to put

62

the ball in the pocket using full body, self-paced movement, with as many preparatory movements

63

as the subject needs for each shoot. We implemented this as a real-world task, basically only adding

64

sensors to a pool table setting, i.e. subjects use the natural tools and setups they normally would,

65

carry out the natural motor commands, receive the natural somatosensory feedback and experience

66

the same satisfaction rewards when they put the ball in pocket. In this paradigm, as in most everyday

67

motor learning experiences, performance errors were not driven by perturbations but by the

68

complexity of learning the task (which takes years to master) and noise in the nervous system

69

(Faisal et al., 2008). Due to the lack of constrains and feedback manipulations, learning in this

70

paradigm may not be predominantly mediated by a specific learning mechanism, or by the same

71

learning mechanism for all subjects. We explored the use of the PMBR dynamics as a signature for

72

a dominant learning mechanism, and validated it using task-performance metrices.

Results

74

30 right-handed volunteers, with little to no previous experience playing billiards,

75

performed 300 repeated trials (6 sets of 50 trials each with short breaks in-between) where the cue

76

ball and target ball were placed in the same locations, and subjects were asked to shoot the target

77

ball towards the far-left corner pocket (Figure 1A). During the entire learning process, we recorded

78

the subjects' brain activity with wireless EEG (Figure 1B), and the balls on the pool table were

79

tracked with a high-speed camera to assess the outcome of each trial (Figure 1C). We divided the

80

trials into blocks of 25 trials (each experimental set of 50 trials was divided to two blocks to increase

81

the resolution in time). The learning curve showed a decay in the directional error of the target ball

82

(relative to the direction from its origin to the center of the target pocket) over trials (Figure 1D).

The PMBR, a transient increase in beta oscillations across the sensorimotor network after

85

the end of the movement, was clearly evident in the data (Figure 2A). On average across subjects

86

there was no clear trend of PMBR (increase or decrease) over learning (Figure 2B). With a data

87

driven approach, we assessed if there may be multiple groups with different PMBR trends that

88

averaging blends away. We used generative Bayesian modelling and fitted the PMBR data (a 12-

89

dimensional matrix, one data point per run for each subject) with Gaussian mixture models of one

93

The most meaningful measure for learning is the PMBR correlation with the performance

94

error, as it actually accounts for the dependency between this brain signal and the behavior, and it

95

was reported to show negative correlations in classic adaptation task consistently across individuals

96

(e.g. Tan et al., 2016). The subject-by-subject correlation over blocks between the PMBR and the

97

directional error showed a clear bimodal grouping. While 16 of the 30 subjects showed negative

98

PMBR-Error correlations (as reported in adaptation studies), the other 14 subjects showed positive

99

correlations. Again, we used generative Bayesian modelling and fitted the PMBR-Error

100

correlations distribution with Gaussian mixture models of one to five components, the information

101

criterions (AIC & AICc) yield a bimodal distribution (Figure 2D), clearly grouping the subjects

102

with the positive and the negative correlation coefficients (Figure 2E). The opposite signs of the

103

correlations reflect opposite dynamics, further justifying a grouping into two distinct groups. This

104

validated our findings with the purely data driven approach on the multidimensional PMBR data.

105

Since errors decay over learning, the PMBR-Error correlation was negatively correlated with the

4

106

PMBR dynamic (increase/decrease). Thus, the first group showed a clear trend of PMBR increase

107

over learning (p<0.001), while the second group showed clear trend of PMBR decrease over

108

learning (p<0.0001) (Figure 2F). Thus, for simplicity, we named the groups PMBR Increasers and

109

PMBR Decreasers.

110

While we pursued a probabilistic analysis Bayesian framework of data science, to further

111

validate this grouping we also tried a completely different method. We used unsupervised fuzzy c-

112

means (FCM) clustering, tested for two to ten clusters using a cluster validity index based on the

113

ratio between within cluster variation and between clusters separation (Zhang et al., 2008). The

114

validity index strictly suggested two clusters in the data, which were the same groups found by the

115

Gaussian mixture model: the subjects with the positive and the negative PMBR-Error correlation

116

coefficients. Additionally, since we calculated beta-power changes as percent signal change relative

117

to the average power over the block (see methods), the observed group differences might be driven

118

by differences in their baselines. However, we found that this was not the case: there was no real

119

difference in the beta-power baseline between the groups, in terms of their values nor in their trend

120

over learning (Figure 2G). There was no significant difference between the groups’ beta-power

121

baseline in any of the blocks (p>0.07) and not in the change of the beta-power baseline between

122

blocks (p>0.58). Lastly, we ensured that these grouping were evident with both EEG systems used

123

in the study. The brain activity of 20 subjects was recorded with EPOC+ while the other 10 were

124

recorded with DSI-24 (see methods). From the subjects recorded with the EPOC+ system 10

125

subjects were PMBR Increasers and the other 10 were PMBR Decreasers. From the subjects

126

recorded with the DSI-24 there were 6 PMBR Increasers and 4 PMBR Decreasers.

127

Correspondingly, there was no correlation between the system and the PMBR-Error correlation

128

(Spearman rank correlation r=0.01, p=0.97).

129

Based on the EEG data, which suggests two groups of subjects with different PMBR

130

dynamics, we looked for behavioral signatures in the task performance of different learning

131

between these groups. The lag-1 autocorrelation (ACF(1)) of the performance measure (in our case,

132

the directional error of the target-ball relative to the pocket) was suggested as an index of

133

performance in motor-skill learning, where close to zero values corresponds to high skill (van Beers

134

et al., 2013). We calculated for each subject the ACF(1) in the first and the second half of the

135

training session (blocks 1-6 and 7-12, respectively). The ACF(1) values of both groups were

136

significantly greater than zero during both halves of the session (t test p<0.01), as expected for

137

naïve participance (Figure 3A). But, the decay in the ACF(1) from the first half of the training

138

session to the second was significantly higher for the PMBR Decreasers (t test p<0.01, Figure 3B).

139

Additionally, the decay in the intertrial variability (measured from the first block (trials 1-25) to

140

the learning plateau (trials 201-300)) was also significantly larger in the PMBR Decreasers (t test

141

p<0.05, Figure 3C).

142

Within subject, the PMBR Increasers showed negative correlations over blocks between

143

the PMBR and the directional variability, while the PMBR Decreasers showed positive

144

correlations, leading to a very significant difference between the groups (t test p<0.0001, Figure

145

3D left). The same trend was evident for the trial-to-trial directional changes (t test p<0.0001,

146

Figure 3D middle). As a control for head movements contamination of the PMBR dynamics we

147

looked for correlation over blocks between the PMBR and the peak head acceleration during the

148

same time interval. Here we found no significant correlations for either of the groups (Figure 3D

149

right), and most importantly, no difference between the groups (t test p=0.99).

151

After learning plateaus, the PMBR Decreasers were slightly more accurate (Figure 4A) and

152

less variable (Figure 4B). More importantly, PMBR Decreasers seemed to modify their variability

153

(actively control of the exploration-exploitation trade-off, explicitly or implicitly) to improve

154

learning, as evidenced by their high variability in the first block and the very steep decrease towards

155

the second (Figure 4B). The dynamical control of the variability was even more strongly evident in

156

the trial-to-trail directional changes, where the PMBR Decreasers showed much bigger changes

157

over the first 4 blocks (100 trials), therefore using more exploration then the PMBR Increasers who

158

made smaller changes from one trial to the next (t test p<0.05, Figure 4C). Also, PMBR Increasers

159

tended to have higher complexity in their movement, i.e. use more DoF, throughout the training

160

session (t test p<0.05, Figure 4D).

161

Finally, the PMBR Decreasers were on average better learners (mean learning rates were

162

0.48 and 0.6 for the PMBR Increasers and PMBR Decreasers respectively) though the group

163

difference was not significant (t test p=0.17). We explored the correlation between learning and the

164

PMBR change over blocks (the difference between the final PMBR over the learning plateau: trials

165

201-300, and the initial PMBR over the first block: trials 1-25). Across all subjects, we found no

166

correlation between the learning rate and the initial PMBR or the PMBR change. When considering

167

each group separately, for the PMBR Decreasers there was no clear trend, but the PMBR Increasers

168

showed a clear trend (though non-significant) of positive correlation of the PMBR change with

169

learning (Figure 4E). Meaning, in the PMBR Increasers group subjects who had more PMBR

increase showed more learning.

Discussion

173

In this paper we detected brain activity signatures for motor learning in complex real-world task.

174

Our results produce new insights into motor learning by revealing two types of motor learners with

175

different EEG dynamics in their PMBR over learning: PMBR Increasers and PMBR Decreasers.

176

These groups were defined by the correlation between the dynamics of their PMBR and their

177

performance errors, but also showed clear task-level differences which suggest differences in the

178

underlying learning mechanisms.

179

The two known main mechanisms that drive motor learning – error-based learning and

180

reward-based reinforcement learning – are engaging different neural processes (e.g. Doyon and

181

Benali, 2005; Doyon et al., 2003; Uehara et al., 2018). While both mechanisms can contribute to

182

learning in any given task, the constrains of the highly controlled laboratory-tasks common in the

183

field induce the predominance of one mechanism over the other. In motor adaptation tasks the

184

dominant mechanism is error-based learning, guided by an internal forward model which is updated

185

based on sensory-prediction errors; while in tasks often addressed as skill-learning (such as

186

sequence-learning, curve-tracking, and force-tracking) the dominant mechanism is reward-based

187

learning where the controller learns form reinforcement of successful actions (Haith and Krakauer,

188

2013; Krakauer and Mazzoni, 2011). PMBR was reported to increase over learning in adaptation

189

tasks (e.g. Tan et al., 2014, 2016; Torrecillos et al., 2015), showing negative correlations with the

190

decreasing errors, and decrease (itself or its magnetic resonance spectroscopy correlate) over skill-

191

learning tasks (e.g. Floyer-Lea et al., 2006; Kolasinski et al., 2019; Kranczioch et al., 2008). PMBR

192

is positively correlated with magnetic resonance spectroscopy-measured GABA concentration

193

(Cheng et al., 2017; Gaetz et al., 2011). This may be due to the general correlation of Beta activity

194

with GABAergic activity (Hall et al., 2010, 2011; Roopun et al., 2006; Yamawaki et al., 2008). We

195

raise the possibility of a more nuanced link of GABA to motor learning: namely that the two

196

diverging PMBR dynamics (increase vs decrease) reflect that GABA activity is a distinguishing

197

feature of different motor learning mechanisms. These may be reflections of GABAergic

198

projections from different subcortical regions, cerebellum for error-based adaptation and basal

199

ganglia for reward-based reinforcement learning (Doyon and Benali, 2005; Doyon et al., 2003).

200

In summary, we find the PMBR-Error correlation to be a signature of motor learning

201

mechanisms. In the data recorded during real-world motor learning in the current study, we found

202

two groups of subjects: PMBR Increasers and PMBR Decreasers. The PMBR Increasers had low

203

initial PMBR amplitudes and showed an increase over learning negatively correlated with the

204

decreasing directional errors, presumably used error-based adaptation as its dominant learning

205

mechanism. The PMBR Decreasers had higher initial PMBR amplitudes and showed a decrease

206

over learning positively correlated with the decreasing directional errors, presumably used reward-

207

based learning as its dominant learning mechanism. Importantly, on a subject-by-subject basis,

208

previous works in laboratory adaptation tasks showed only one category of learners, all have

209

negative PMBR-Error correlations (e.g. Tan et al., 2016). Thus, our findings here reveal that real-

210

world learning is more complex, in terms of learning mechanism, and involve more inter-subject

211

differences.

212

The behavioral differences between the groups support the notion of a different

213

predominant learning mechanism. While there were no significant differences between the groups

214

in their initial errors or their total learning, there were clear group difference in the learning process.

215

First, the lag-1 autocorrelation (ACF(1)) was suggested as an index of performance in motor-skill

216

learning, measuring the optimality of trial-by-trial motor planning (van Beers et al., 2013). ACF(1)

217

of zero indicates optimal performance. Here we used the decay in the ACF(1) as a measure for skill

218

learning: during skill learning ACF(1) should decay towards zero. Since the estimation of

219

autocorrelations from short time series is fundamentally biased (van Beers, 2009; Kendall, 1954;

220

Marriott and Pope, 1954), we calculated the ACF(1) over the first and the second halves of the

221

learning session (150 trials) and not in each block of 25 trials. As expected for naïve participance,
8

222

the ACF(1) values of both groups during both halves of the session were significantly greater than

223

zero (Figure 3A). More importantly, while the PMBR Increasers showed no significant difference

224

in the ACF(1) between the two halves of the session, the PMBR Decreasers showed a significant

225

decay (Figure 3B). This decay is a behavioral indication for learning mechanism differences

226

between the groups. Second, the intertrial variability patterns were in line with the suggested

227

learning mechanisms. The PMBR Decreasers (reward-based learners) showed more decay in their

228

intertrial variability over learning (Figure 3C & Figure 4B), a known feature of skill learning

229

(Krakauer et al., 2019; Shmuelof et al., 2012). Additionally, the trial-to-trail directional changes

230

over the first 4 blocks (100 trials) were much higher for the PMBR Decreasers (reward-based

231

learners) than the PMBR Increasers (error-based learners), suggesting that the first group used more

232

exploration while the second made smaller changes from trial-to-trial, as expected in error-based

233

adaptation (Figure 4C).

234

Laboratory-tasks tend to emphasize a specific learning mechanism for all subjects based

235

on the types of feedback and perturbation (e.g. Galea et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2011; Kim et al.,

236

2019). In contrast, real-world motor learning probably involves multiple high- and low-level

237

learning mechanisms, where different subjects might emphasize one learning modality over the

238

other. In our real-world learning paradigm, subjects performed error-based adaptation as they

239

learned from the directional error of the target ball in each trial, but they also performed reward-

240

based learning as they learned to use the cue and their body joints while making a shot by

241

reinforcement of successful actions. We speculate that the PMBR Increasers, who showed the

242

neural and behavioral patterns reported in motor adaptation paradigms, mostly learned via error-

243

based learning approach, while the PMBR Decreasers, who showed the neural and behavioral

244

patterns reported in skill learning tasks, used more reinforcement of successful actions.

245

Recent studies suggest that event-related desynchronizations and synchronizations, such as

246

PMBR, are driven by beta bursts (Little et al., 2019; Seedat et al., 2020; Wessel, 2020) which carry

247

more information than the trail-averaged band oscillation. At the same time, a recent study

248

suggested spatial differences between beta oscillations that reflect implicit and explicit learning

249

(Jahani et al., 2020). These recent developments highlight the potential for capturing neural

250

signatures of learning in EEG beta. To further validate the current findings, future studies will need

251

to compare the PMBR dynamics during learning of the same paradigm with different dominant

252

mechanism, forced by experimental trickery (i.e. using feedback manipulations and constrains).

253

Conclusions

254

In this study we demonstrate the feasibility and importance of studying human

255

neuroscience in-the-wild, and specifically in naturalistic real-world motor learning. We highlight

256

that real-world motor learning involves different neural dynamics for different subjects, which were

257

previously associated different learning mechanisms in different tasks. Presumably, the individual

258

subject’s proportion of applying the two learning mechanisms could be revealed by the overall

259

trend of the PMBR over learning. It suggests that real-world motor learning involves multi-modal

260

learning mechanisms which subjects combine in new ways when faced with the complexity of

261

learning in the real-world, and different subjects emphasize one mechanism over the other.

262

Methods

263

Experimental Setup and Design. 30 right-handed healthy human volunteers with normal or

264

corrected-to-normal visual acuity (12 women and 18 men, aged 24±3) participated in the study. All

265

volunteers gave informed consent prior participating to the study, and all experimental procedures

266

were approved by Imperial College Research Ethics Committee and performed in accordance with

267

the declaration of Helsinki. The volunteers, who had little to none previous experience with playing

268

billiards, performed 300 repeated trials where the cue ball (white) and the target ball (red) were

269

placed in the same locations and the subject was asked to shoot the target ball towards the pocket

270

of the far-left corner (Figure 1A). The trials were split into 6 sets of 50 trials with a short break in-

271

between to allow the subjects to reset a bit and reduce potential fatigue. Each experimental set (of

272

50 trials) took 8 to 12 minutes. For the data analysis we further split each set into two blocks of 25

273

trials each, resulting in 12 blocks. During the entire learning process, we recorded the subjects'

274

brain activity with a wireless EEG headset (Figure 1B). The balls on the pool table were tracked

275

with a high-speed camera (Dalsa Genie Nano) to assess the subjects’ success in the game and to

276

analyze the changes throughout learning, not only in the body movement and brain activity but also

277

in its outcome – the ball movement (Figure 1C).

278

EEG acquisition and preprocessing. For 20 subjects, EEG was recorded at 256Hz using a

279

wireless 14 channel EEG system (Emotiv EPOC+, Emotiv Inc., CA, USA). For the other 10

280

subjects, EEG was recorded at 300Hz using a wireless 21 channel EEG system (DSI-24, Wearable

281

Sensing Inc., CA, USA) and down sampled to 256Hz to be analyzed with the same pipeline as the

282

other subjects. EEG signals were preprocessed in EEGLAB (https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab; Delorme

283

and Makeig, 2004). EEG signals were first band-pass filtered at 5-35 Hz using a basic FIR filter,

284

and then decomposed into independent component (IC) and artifacted ICs were removed with

285

ADJUST, an EEGLAB plug-in for automatic artifact detection (Mognon et al., 2011). All further

286

analysis was performed on the C3 channel. For the Emotiv subjects it was interpolated from the

287

recorded channels with spherical splines using EEGLAB 'eeg_interp' function.

288

EEG time-frequency analysis. Each block was transformed in the time-frequency domain

289

by convolution with the complex Morlet wavelets in 1 Hz steps. Event-related EEG power change

290

was subsequently calculated as the percentage change by log-transforming the raw power data and

291

then normalizing relative to the average power calculated over the block, as no clear baseline could

292

be defined during the task (Alayrangues et al., 2019; Tan et al., 2014, 2016; Torrecillos et al., 2015),

293

and then subtracting one from the normalized value and multiplying by 100. Event-related power

294

changes in the beta band (13–30 Hz) were investigated. Since it is a free behavior study there was

295

no go cue and the subject shoot when they wanted. As a result, the best-defined time point during

296

a trial was the end of the movement, defined by the beginning of the cue ball movement. Thus, the

297

post-movement beta rebound (PMBR) was defined as the average normalized power over a 200ms

298

window centered on the peak of the power after movement termination (Tan et al., 2016). The

299

PMBR was calculated for each individual trial before averaging over blocks for further analysis.

300

The time frequency analysis was performed with custom software written in MATLAB (R2017a,

301

The MathWorks, Inc., MA, USA).
