The phenomenology of Eating Disorders (ED) relates with altered functioning of the
Autonomic Nervous System (ANS). The lack of agreement in what comes to the direction
and significance of such alterations is possibly due to the variability in the ED spectrum.
As the stress response system is an integral part of the ANS, we propose to investigate
ANS tonic variations and phasic activations in response to stressors. We hypothesize
that, while using stress as a test probe, characteristic ANS dysregulations in ED may be
found when considering several physiological signals measured over time, and weighted
by the individual psychological profiles. In this article we describe a novel methodological
approach to investigate this hypothesis with the aim of providing further clarification on
the ED spectrum conceptualization. The proposed methodology has been designed to
be easily integrated in clinical practice and, eventually, in daily life. The population under
observation includes both patients in treatment for ED, and matched controls. The study
session has the duration of 1 day, including: (1) the administration of a stress task in a
controlled environment and (2) naturalistic data collection. The stress task is designed
to elicit both mentally and physically driven ANS activation. The naturalistic component
intends to illustrate the psychophysiology in everyday life. We use wearable devices to
continuously and non-invasively measure bio-signals related to ANS functioning. This
information is complemented with psychometric information from validated stress and
ED scales and ecological momentary assessments. The protocol has received ethical
approval and has been implemented in practice, currently accounting for 37 patients
(out of 120) and 16 controls (out of 60). Ongoing work focus on the definition and
implementation of a data processing pipeline to quantitatively test our hypothesis, both
standard statistical methods and more exploratory machine learning approaches will
be considered.

Quantifying Eating Disorders’ Psychopathology

INTRODUCTION

Arousal and regulatory systems are among the five Research
Domain Criteria (RDoC) appointed as potentially valid
dimensional constructs underlying psychopathology (Cuthbert,
2014). The arousal system facilitates interactions with the
environment in a context-specific manner and has associations
to physical fitness (Huang et al., 2013). In psychophysiology,
arousal is defined as the response to a perturbation (i.e., a
stressor) that may create a homeostatic deregulation of the
organism (Koolhaas et al., 2011). While acute arousal can be
accommodated by physiological processes, prolonged activation
can result in pathological states.
In the human body, specific neuroendocrine paths are
triggered causing arousal (Kemeny, 2003; Lo Sauro et al., 2008).
The first one involves the ANS (Kemeny, 2003), a part of
the Peripheral Nervous System concerning involuntary bodily
processes. The ANS encompasses two branches working in
opposition to regulate the body equilibrium: the sympathetic
branch associated with arousal and the flight-or-fight (FoF)
response, and the parasympathetic associated with rest-anddigest states (McCorry, 2007). The FoF is a full body effort
to increase blood flow to skeletal muscle, causing considerable
effects at a physiological level. It leads to increased heart rate
(HR); vasoconstriction in the gut and kidneys to divert blood
to the muscles; bronchodilation to facilitate oxygen uptake
and carbon dioxide outtake; increase of glucose and fatty
acid concentrations in the blood to leverage metabolic needs;
generalized sweating for thermoregulation; pupil dilation to
allow more light in and adapt vision to focus in the distance.
Considering such phenomena, ANS arousal can be described on
the basis of pupillary dilation, muscle activity, cardiac activity,
respiration rate, blood pressure (BP), skin conductance (SC), and
skin temperature (Kemeny, 2003; McCorry, 2007).
Physiological substrates involved in ANS regulation are
altered in ED (Westmoreland et al., 2016), for instance decreased
HR positively related to lower metabolic rate (Buchhorn, 2016),
HRV is inversely related to body weight (Karason et al.,
1999; Mazurak et al., 2011), lower skin conductivity relates to
dehydration caused by reduced fluid intake or purge, decreased
skin temperature is linked to poor circulation induced by reduced
cardiac activity. ED onset is often preceded by a specific stressful
event (Wheat et al., 2000; Cabras et al., 2008), and the disease
maintenance has also been connected to chronical arousal states,
linked to specific contexts triggering psychopathological behavior
(Wheat et al., 2000).
Literature studies on ANS function in ED report two main
study conditions: (1) baseline observations, e.g., at rest or
respecting to slow tonic variations; (2) task induced, e.g.,
in reaction to a stressor. In summary, most studies point
out the existence of baseline ANS dysregulations, that are
transversal to AN and BN (Mazurak et al., 2011; Buchhorn, 2016;
Chudecka and Lubkowska, 2016; Peschel et al., 2016). These
dysregulations in AN and fasting BN have been documented
as a parasympathetic overactivation with a correspondent
sympathetic withdrawal. Task induced responses, mostly show
no differences across healthy and ED samples (AN, BN, BED,
and EDNOS) (Vocks et al., 2007; Vögele et al., 2009; Hilbert
et al., 2011), though, inconsistencies are reported (Koo-Loeb

Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and Bulimia Nervosa (BN) constitute
the official ED diagnoses according to the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)1 (American
Psychiatric Association, 2000). Partial AN/BN syndromes and
the prominent Binge Eating Disorder (BED) are included in
a residual and highly heterogeneous subset of ED, the Eating
Disorders Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS). ED markedly
influence the physical and mental well-being of sufferers. AN is
associated with intense fear of fatness, distorted body image, and
exaggerated dieting, leading to severe weight loss. BN features
recurrent food binges followed by compensatory behaviors (e.g.,
purges, excessive exercise, or fasting) to avoid weight gain. BED
regards frequent episodes of fast intake of exaggerated food
portions, accompanied by feelings of lack of control (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013a). While not well-documented by
epidemiological studies, it is systematically reported that most
ED cases fall in the EDNOS group (Machado et al., 2012;
Smink et al., 2012; Vo et al., 2017). We know that only a
minority of ED cases reaches the health care system (KeskiRahkonen and Mustelin, 2016), even though most sufferers
receive treatment related to unspecific emotional problems
(Hudson et al., 2007). ED etiology is multifactorial with more
than 70% of patients having psychiatric comorbidities and often
switching across diagnosis within the ED spectrum over time
(Hudson et al., 2007; Larranaga et al., 2012; Keski-Rahkonen
and Mustelin, 2016). Remission occurs after at least 4 years
(Keel and Brown, 2010; Kessler et al., 2013). Therefore, in
order to comprehensively improve treatment outcome, we may
need to better grasp the seemingly dimensional underlying
psychopathological mechanisms of these illnesses.
The official guidelines for classification of psychiatric
pathologies are described in the DSM (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000, 2013b). Disorders are presented as categories
and symptoms are evaluated in a syndromic manner. However,
while it has been useful as a basis for communication among
clinicians and researchers, the DSM validity has long been
discussed, and after several updates it is still flawed (Vo et al.,
2017). In general, the categorical conceptualization of mental
disorders does not rely on a grounded neuro-psychopathological
basis, and has been reduced to a matter of opinion or
preference (Haslam, 2003; Williamson et al., 2005). Several
studies have explored a dimensional perspective, i.e., the idea
of a continuous spectrum, to model mental health disorders
(Haslam, 2003) and in particular ED (Williamson et al., 2005).
Explorations were grounded solely on information from selfreports and psychometric data (no physiological data). According
to preliminary results, both categorical and dimensional
perspectives may need to be combined in order to describe the
mental health disorders spectrum (Williamson et al., 2005).

1 This

classification was recently updated on the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric
Association , 2013), though as the methods described in this article were drawn
during the transition period, the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association,
2000) notation is still adopted.

Quantifying Eating Disorders’ Psychopathology

• Do ED patients present characteristic autonomic activation
during the laboratory stress task, when compared to
healthy controls?
• Do autonomic signals during reported high stress moments, in
an ambulant condition, reflect the laboratory analysis results
(i.e., do both groups still differ according to the previously
identified, parameters if any)?
• Can the four most prominent ED classes (i.e., AN, BN, BED,
and EDNOS) be identified based on autonomic signals?
• Based on a data driven approach, relying both on
psychological descriptors and ANS signals, can we establish
a multiparameter model of the ED spectrum (i.e., AN, BN,
BED, and EDNOS) that describes psychopathological state?

et al., 2000). Additionally, AN and BN are better documented
than BED and EDNOS in what comes to ANS alterations.
Cardiovascular parameters (HR and HRV) are the most wellexplored descriptors of ANS function in ED, both at baseline
and in reaction to stressors. Temperature, BP, and SC are
obtained with short measurement protocols, so their use toward
pervasive follow-up is not well-explored. Small sample size is
indicated in most studies as a limitation, and short cross-sectional
measurements also pose limitations toward fully understanding
ANS functioning in ED. Overall these studies recommend
that considerations should be given to age, body mass index
(BMI), comorbidities, associated clinical complications (e.g.,
starvation, malnourishment, and low body weight), types of
eating disordered behaviors (e.g., vomiting), illness duration
(chronic or acute), phase of the disease being considered
(Mazurak et al., 2011), disorder subtypes (Peschel et al., 2016),
and medications.
Our goal is to investigate the tonic and phasic activation of the
ANS across the ED spectrum, to discover associations between
the psychopathology and arousal states, eventually recurring to
advanced data fusion techniques. In this paper, we describe
the methodological approach in the basis of our investigation.
Answering questions related to whether ANS dysregulations
reflect ED psychopathology, are a side effect of the medical
complications of the disease (e.g., vomiting and starvation), or
both, is out of our scope.
Our work aims at bridging some of the research gaps found
in the literature, namely: (1) the full ED spectrum has only
punctually been studied using the same psychophysiological
protocol (Vocks et al., 2007); (2) physical fitness is usually
not assessed in psychophysiological studies and is especially
relevant in ED, as it can vary across extremes; (3) biosignals from several sources have previously been measured
in controlled tasks (Vocks et al., 2007; Vögele et al., 2009;
Hilbert et al., 2011), though, conclusions were established
based on each source separately, without considering data
fusion strategies; (4) finally, there has been no report on the
study of ED based on bio-signals collected in naturalistic
settings. With the general mindset of providing tools to
leverage the clinicians work, while testing possibilities that
can enhance the follow-up in naturalistic conditions, we
employ tools that could be easily integrated as a part of
clinical practice. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)
to gather information on activity, food consumption, and
feelings, if proved useful, can be integrated in a smartphone
application. The wearables used for non-invasive autonomic
sensing are the most compact and discreet non-invasive
sensors in the market, as compared to sensing modalities,
such as autonomic Electromyogram (EMG) or central
Electroencephalogram (EEG).
We hypothesize that the ED state may be differentiated from
a healthy state using a multiparameter approach to data analysis
based on psychological and physiological signals. We also intend
to test if ED psychopathology can be indexed based on such
information. Both hypotheses will be tested on controlled and
ambulant data. The following guiding research questions were
established to decomposed and test our hypotheses:

Frontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

In the following sections we will present the experimental
design (including study population, protocol description,
power calculation) (section Experimental Design), discuss the
limitations of our approach and suggest possibilities for further
development (section Discussion).

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Toward studying the ANS in ED we devised an experiment
that would allow us to capture both tonic and phasic ANS
activation using the following conditions: (1) at rest in the lab;
(2) in response to a stressor in the lab; and (3) in naturalistic
conditions, where both rest and stress situations may occur.
During the day of the study participants are administered a stress
task in a controlled environment, and afterwards they continue
freely with their routines for the rest of the day. Measurements
of autonomic physiology using wearable sensors are pervasive
throughout the day, and EMA on stress, feelings and activities
take place every hour.
The detailed methodology is described in the next sections.
The protocol was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee
of U. Z. Leuven (Belgium), and the study has been running ever
since February 2018, with an amendment accepted on January
2019 toward extending the number of centers where subjects
are recruited.

Study Sample
The study sample is composed of a group of ED patients (clinical
group) and a group of healthy subjects (control group). Detailed
admission criteria for each group are displayed in Table 1.
The clinical group includes patients (inpatient, day
hospital/program, or ambulant regimen) receiving treatment
for their ED at a medical unit in Belgium. In the treatment
context, all patients, including the ones admitted at the hospital,
have free time for rest or social interactions, and can leave the
treatment facilities. Mealtimes are fixed in the inpatient and
day hospital situations. To pinpoint characteristic features of
ED only subjects in treatment are considered, when there is
irrefutable need for clinical attention. To gather information on
the psychopathology across the ED spectrum, we include patients
with strict diagnoses (i.e., AN, BN, BED), but also those falling
within EDNOS. These classifications are primarily provided by
the clinician. Since we intend to focus on characteristic ED traits

and its comorbidities, we exclude subjects with coexistent health
issues not directly connected to the core features of ED, such
as somatic chronical illness with current impact in daily life or
need for continued medication, and acute illness. Knowing from
epidemiological studies that women are the major group in ED
(Larranaga et al., 2012; Smink et al., 2012), and having empirical
evidence that men in treatment for ED are relatively sparse, we
opted to include only females to establish a grounded statistical
analysis. Age was limited to a period that should be stable in
terms of major or definitive endocrine changes. We exclude
pregnant women related to their special endocrine state. We
exclude carriers of implanted devices (e.g., pacemaker) to avoid
interference with the wearables. We exclude individuals with
dyslexia, dyscalculia, and conditioned mobility, which could
interfere with, the execution of the Stroop-Color Word, the
arithmetic and the fitness tasks, respectively.
The control group is composed of full-time employees in a 9
to 5 desk job, a condition that will allow us to compare the period
of activity and the activity intensity with that of the patients
in the hospital. Individuals in this group cannot display major
health issues that impact their daily life or that require continued
medication, nor should they have history of mental health issues.
Controls are matched to patients according to gender, age
and BMI ranges, in accordance to the scheme in Figure 1.
The BMI intervals proposed by the World Health Organization
(WHO) (World Health Organization, 2018) were considered to
establish approximate BMI matches, as exact matches would
be unpractical for the extremes found in AN and BED that
cannot find parallel in the healthy population. For age matching
we consider an interval of ±1 year around the age of the
patient, toward maintaining identical demographics in both
groups, under the assumption that the difference of 1 year
is not biologically relevant in the range considered. With this
scheme we intend to maintain comparable anthropometrics
across groups.

The study is conducted over two separate days of contact (see
Table 2): the recruitment day and the study day. In the first
day of contact, the participant indicates the language preference
(materials are available in English and Dutch), provides legal
consent for data to be acquired and is screened toward verifying
the admission criteria. A second day of contact is only scheduled
if the participant abides to the admission criteria. The procedures
related to the study day take place in the period from 9 a.m. to 5
p.m. The first 1 h 30 min takes place in a controlled environment,
during which the study procedures are introduced, devices are
setup, the participant is asked to fill in a set of standardized
psychometric questionnaires and is administered a multimodal
stress task. For the next 6 h 30 min, the participant continues a
regular daily routine in ambulant environment. Measurements
of autonomic physiology using wearable sensors are pervasive
during this day and EMA on stress, feelings and activities takes
place at each hour. In the clinical group weight is assessed during
this day. In the control group, the weight is evaluated on the
first visit to allow the BMI match to be found, and then assumed
stable across sessions. The clinician (or the patient) provides a
clinical report on the symptomatology being experienced and
the type of ED being managed. Both groups abide to similar
procedures, described in a standard operating procedure that
guides the researchers and clinicians involved in the study.

Sensing Devices
Two wearable sensors are employed in this study: (1) the
Chillband (IMEC vzw, Belgium) is a wrist worn sensing device
that captures SC, skin temperature and acceleration (Figure 2A),
at sampling frequencies of 256, 1, and 32 Hz, respectively; (2)
the Electrocardiogram (ECG) patch (Biotelemetry, Denmark) is a
sensing node attached to an adhesive chest patch, it captures ECG
and acceleration (Figure 2B) at a sampling frequency of 256 and
32 Hz, respectively. Both wearables were previously employed in

Standardized Psychometric Tools
Four standardized psychometric tools are employed in this study
to model the participants’ psychology: the MINI 5.0, a diagnostic
interview; the EDI3 (diagnostic list and scale), a self-report to
assess ED psychopathology; the DEBQ, a self-report to assess
general eating style, and behaviors; and the PSS10, a self-report
on stress. These tools have been highly validated and are widely
used in trials. Table 3 describes each of them and their purpose
in the context of this study.

Ecological Momentary Assessment
Ecological Momentary Assessment is a psychometric method
intended at overcoming the limitations of retrospective selfreports, that rely on recollection of past events and may be biased.
This is accomplished by regularly assessing the individuals’ state
with short questions, providing a close to real time assessment
in a naturalist setting (Keel and Brown, 2010). In the past
decade, EMA has been increasingly used to study ED, it has
been shown useful in enhancing the empirical understanding
on the disease and is regarded as powerful instrument to
devise personalized and just-in-time interventions (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013a).
In this study the EMA consists in a paper diary (cf. Figure 3)
that is filled in at every hour, from 9 h 30 to 16 h 30, totaling
eight reports. As a reminder, an hourly alarm is set on the
participant’s phone. The diary includes a one-time report about
consumption, nutrition and sleeping habit (Buysse et al., 1989),
and assessment of events occurred during the past day that may
affect the study results (e.g., abnormal sleep duration, alcohol
consumption). The first encompasses: activities; food, drink, and
medicine consumption; smoke; food purging, overeating, and
avoidance contemplation; ratings of stress on a Visual Analog
Scales (VAS); and a verbal description of the previous hour.
The second includes a momentary evaluation of ratings of stress
[VAS and self-assessment manikins (Lang and Bradley, 1994)]
and feelings toward food according to three dimensions: physical
fullness, mental satisfaction, and intent to eat (Jiménez-Cruz

FIGURE 2 | Wearable sensors: (A) Chillband, (B) ECG patch, and (C) sensor
positioning.

a large-scale study on daily stress in office workers (Boucsein
et al., 2012). These wearables were the most compact and discreet
non-invasive sensors in the market at the time of the trial setup.
Despite being relevant and frequently used in laboratory settings,
EMG and BP are less convenient for measurements in daily life
and they were not considered for this study. During the study
day participants carry three devices: two Chillbands and one
ECG patch, placed according to the depiction in Figure 2C. The
rational of employing two wrist sensors lays on the fact that wrist
SC has been shown to diverge across both sides of the upper body
(Picard et al., 2015), and this can provide important information
on the arousal states in ambulant conditions.

Clinical Information
In the clinical group, the clinician responsible for the patient
fills in a form with clinical information, including the treatment
program (i.e., inpatient, day hospital/program, ambulant), days

Tool

Description

Purpose

Mini International
Neuropsychiatric Interview
(MINI)

• Structured diagnostic interview to asses mental health disorders
(Sheehan et al., 1998) according to DSM guidelines, with yes/no
answers.
• Takes 15–60 min to complete, depending on the answers.
• Scores high in validation and reliability Lecrubier et al., 1997,
and it has been widely used in research.

• MINI-screen version 5.0 is employed to refute the existence of
mental health disorders in the control groupa , and to assess the
ED typology and psychiatric comorbidities in the clinical group.

Eating Disorders Inventory
(EDI3)

• Fifteen minutes self-report focusing on psychological
dimensions with clinical relevance for ED. Includes a diagnostic
list appendix to assess demographics and anthropometrics.
• It is one of the most used tools in ED research Túry et al., 2010
and its psychometric properties are satisfactory Clausen et al.,
2011.

• EDI3 and the diagnostic list are delivered to both study groups
to quantify the ED psychopathology.

Dutch Eating Behavior
Questionnaire (DEBQ)

• Ten minutes self-report.
• Includes three scales (emotional, restrained and external eating)
relevant to characterize eating behaviors.
• Proven successful in assessing eating style traits that are
relevant for ED assessment Wardle, 1987.

• DEBQ is employed to gather a general description of eating
behaviors, as EDI3 concepts are specific to ED and may be
extraneous to non-ED subjects
• It is delivered to both study groups, but is specially relevance to
describe controls, who may present behavioral nuances not
captured in EDI3.

Perceived Stress Scale
(PSS10)

• Assesses individual stress levels during the past month.
• Five minutes self-report consisting of 10 questions, inquiring
how often a certain feeling was experienced on a scale of 0
(never) to 4 (very often).
• Considered an effective indicator of the degree in which life
events are perceived as stressful Kamarck et al., 1983.

• Used toward quantifying stressful events that occurred prior to
the study.
• This information is not covered by ED related assessments. It
goes along with our view on the connection of stress, ANS
dysregulations and ED.

a If

a control subject fulfils the symptoms for a MINI diagnosis then she is excluded, even after passing the initial assessment.

At the beginning and end of the task, participants rate their
stress levels and feelings toward food on a short self-report that
includes questions 12–18 of the diary (Figure 3). The block of
activities involving speaking (Counting task, Stroop Color-Word
test, Calculation test, Stress talk) and the block of ED relevant
stimulus (Food Cues Test) are switched for half the participants,
to control for effects on bio-signals related to habituation to the
study environment.

et al., 2006; Forde, 2018). Each hourly report takes less than a
minute to complete.

Stress Conditioning
We propose a customized stress task designed to elicit
both mental and physical stress-related ANS activations. This
multimodal task integrates mental arithmetic stimuli (Stroop
Color-Word and calculation test), idiosyncratic stimulus (stress
talk), ED specific stimulus (food cues test), physical stimulus
(physical fitness task), baseline, and recovery rest phases
(Figure 4). It takes ∼60 min to complete. The modules and
associated timings are indicated in Table 4 and a detailed
description of each module is provided in Figure 4.
The task is conducted in a dedicated room and monitored by
a trained researcher. The task is displayed on a computer screen,
each phase is temporized, and the progression is automatic. The
screen is recorded (no audiovisual involving the participant is
recorded) to appropriately annotate the sensor data according to
the successive activities. Instructions on the activities related to
each task module are provided on screen and vocalized by the
researcher. The start of the experiment consists of a calibration
procedure for subsequent alignment of signals across sensors.
It consists of five sets of downward/upward torso movements,
conducted while seating, and keeping both hands on top of the
sensor on the chest. Relaxing sounds are reproduced during
baseline and recovery phases, to calm the participant before and
after each stimulus. The researcher keeps a neutral posture, and
is allowed only standard interactions during the stimulus, such
as You have to speak faster; Please, continue; Don’t give up; You
can continue. Performances are not evaluated during the task.

Debriefing and Compensation
At the end of the study day the participants must return the
wearable devices and the diary. The participant is debriefed
and if the diary contains at least eight reports, the participant
receives a 10e voucher for online shopping, as an appreciation
for the participation.

Power Analysis
Power analysis estimation was performed to back up the study
decisions in what comes to the size of the study sample. Toward
this end we considered some simplifications and assumptions:
• We focus only on processing autonomic signals (no
psychological variables).
• All autonomic signals will be analyzed toward extracting
parameters to describe the ANS function (e.g., mean HR
at baseline).
• Each participant will be treated as an observation, represented
by a set of parameters (e.g., mean rest HR, mean HR during
task, mean temperature from 10 h 30–13 h 30, mean SC at
lunch time...).

Task

Description

Purpose

Counting task

• Participant counts from 0 to 100 at a relaxed pace.
• This task takes place both at the beginning and at the end of
the block involving speaking.

• Control for the effect of speaking in the signals captured by the
sensors.
• Not supposed to induce stress.

Stroop Color-Word test

• Depicts how humans read faster than they identify and name
colors.
• Participant is asked to name out loud, as fast as possible and
under a limited time, the color of a word presented on the
screen, while the word itself designates another color.

• General mental activation.
• Social stressor.
• Previously, it was effectively used as a laboratory tool for stress
induction Blondin and Renaud, 1997.

Calculation Test

• Given a starting number displayed on the screen, the participant
is asked to consecutively subtract the number seven from it, as
fast as possible, while speaking out loud the result. In case
there is a mistake, the participant has to restart the subtraction
from the beginning.

• General mental activation.
• Social stressor.
• Effectively used as a in clinical and healthy samples to induce
psychophysiological activation Smets et al., 2016; Huysmans
et al., 2018.

Stress Talk

• Participant is invited to speak about one stressful or emotional
event that occurred in her life.
• Researcher rates how stressful the content of the talk was on a
VAS.

• Idiosyncratic mental stimulus.
• Effectively used as a in clinical and healthy samples to induce
psychophysiological activation Smets et al., 2016; Huysmans
et al., 2018.

Food Cues Test

• Visual cues, i.e., pictures, containing food items of low caloric
and high caloric foods are consecutively presented on the
screen, the participant is asked to observe them.

• ED relevant mental stimulus.

Physical Resilience test

• Consists on cycling in place on a mini-bicycle while trying to
achieve and maintain the velocity of 35 km/h.

• Mild physical task is performed to test the physiological
response to physical activation.

• We assume a Gaussian distribution for all parameters.
• When comparing clinical and control groups only matched
participants will be considered, hence in this situation both
groups will have the same number of individuals.
• Gender, BMI, and Age are controlled by design, and activities
during the stress task are typified.
• The clinical group has four ED subgroups and the control
group has no subgroups.
• Both clinical and control group include a varied set of
individuals, we assume these groups to present comparable

parameter dispersion. When considering clinical subgroups,
the dispersion of parameter values per group should be lower
(i.e., individuals are more alike) except for EDNOS, which
should have similar dispersion as the overall clinical group.
We drafted four analysis methodologies in accordance to the
research questions proposed in the introduction section, and
hereafter, we present the respective power calculations:
• Hypothesis 1: During the stress task, the autonomic parameters
from the clinical group differ from those of the control

8

participants will be available on a weekly basis, and one new
healthy match will be found. Considering that the time limit for
the study is 60 weeks (15 months) related to project constraints,
we will be able to include 120 ED participants and 60 controls.
This scenario agrees with the numbers from the power analysis.

group. Toward evaluating the statistical significance of each
parameter to differentiate across groups (i.e., unpaired
samples) a t-test for two samples is considered. The nominal
variable is being a patient (true or false), and the measurement
variable is one of the autonomic parameters (e.g., mean HR at
baseline). We target high magnitude differences across groups
[high effect size2 , d = 0.8 (Cohen, 1988)], using a strict
significance level3 (p = 0.01), with high power4 (P = 0.85).
In this situation, using R toolboxes for the calculation (R.pwr
library), the minimum sample size attained is 43 individuals
per group.

Data Management
The data acquired in this study is stored and managed using
Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) (Harris et al., 2009),
a secure web-based tool to support research studies hosted at the
University of Leuven. Data input and verification are performed
by two different researchers to ensure data integrity. No direct
identifiers such as name, phone number, or e-mails are kept in the
REDCap database, and the data is pseudo anonymized according
to a customized procedure before further processing. Local copies
of the data are kept in encrypted hard drives and backed-up once
a week.

• Hypothesis 2: During an ambulant condition, the autonomic
parameters from the clinical group differ from those of the
control group. We use the same formulation as in the previous
hypothesis, assuming a t-test for two samples. Since data
collected in uncontrolled conditions is prone to artifacts,
this may affect the signal physiological content and increase
the data variance. Therefore, we expect to find less sharp
differences, hence we set a lower effect size in this case. We
target medium magnitude differences across groups [medium
effect size, d = 0.7 (Cohen, 1988)], using a strict significance
level (p = 0.01), with a high power (P = 0.85). In this situation,
we require at least 55 individuals per group (according to
R.pwr library).
• Hypothesis 3: Patient groups (AN, BN, BED, EDNOS) present
different autonomic parameters. We expect to find differences
across patient groups based on autonomic signals throughout
the full collection. If we assume the symptomatologic
classification to have a parallel on physiology, then we expect
to be able to find four distinct groups in the data, i.e., AN,
BN, BED, and EDNOS. In this context we can use a one-way
ANOVA test to verify the statistical significance of differences
across groups. Targeting high magnitude differences [high
effect size5 , f = 0.4 (Cohen, 1988)], using a strict significance
level (p = 0.01), with a high power (P = 0.85), we require at
least 29 subjects per group (according to R.pwr library).
• As for the fourth research question, related to data driven
clustering and classification of ED patients, both unsupervised
and supervised machine learning techniques will be used and
compared. The diagnostic classes (AN, BN, BED, EDNOS)
will be considered as labels for the supervised methods.
Power calculation for this analysis was omitted given its
exploratory character.

Data Analysis
A preliminary procedure for data analysis includes the generation
of a set of annotations to contextualize the sensor data (Figure 5).
Namely, the movement pattern resulting from the calibration
procedure (Figure 4) is detected by visual inspection on the
acceleration data of each sensor, and used to align the data across
devices (Figure 5A). The task phases are identified by comparing
individual frames of the screen recording to image templates. The
starting point for relevant data is set to the moment at which
the calibration procedure takes place (Figure 5, bold green line).
Sensor data coherent with the stress task are then annotated
based on the timings provided by the screen recording.
Quality of the data, in particular for the ambulant recording,
is evaluated both via visual inspection and via automatic methods
(Jones and Lederman, 2006; Boucsein et al., 2012; Kocielnik et al.,
2013; Orphanidou et al., 2014; Smets et al., 2018).
Tonic and phasic components of the ANS activation
are accounted via calculation of appropriate physiological
parameters (e.g., HR and HRV (Task Force of The European
Society of Cardiology and The North American, 1996; Acharya
et al., 2006; Castaldo et al., 2015), SC level and responses
(Boucsein, 2012) and skin temperature mean and variance) from
the signals. For a complete list of the parameters that will be used
as a starting point to our analysis (cf. section Power analysis)
consult Table S5 on the Supplementary Materials of the article
by Smets et al. (2018).
The laboratory data will be analyzed separately toward
generating a numerical rating (Guo et al., 2018) of the physical
fitness of the participant, that will be used as a covariate in the
ambulant data analysis. In addition to age, BMI, comorbidities,
symptoms, ED subtypes, and medications (highlighted in section
Introduction), also time since admission, fitness, handedness,
and actimetry (based on the accelerometer) will be controlled for.

In summary, to attain statistically relevant findings from this
study we require at least 55 ED participants and respective
controls to test hypothesis 1 and 2, and 116 ED participants
to test hypothesis 3. The number of possible participants is
highly variable, but we envision that in average two new clinical
2 Effect size phenomena is described by Cohen’s d = (mean of clinical sample-mean
of control sample)/average standard deviation. Cohen’s recommendations for the
t-test effect size: small effect size, d = 0.2; medium effect size, d = 0.5; high effect
size, d = 0.8.
3 P(Type I error): probability of finding a difference that actually does not exist.
4 Power = 1–P(Type II error): probability of finding a difference that actually exists.
5 Cohen’s recommendations for the ANOVA effect size: small effect size, f = 0.1;
medium effect size, f = 0.25; high effect size, f = 0.4.

DISCUSSION
While ED are mainly studied according to their psychological
dimension, we proposed a new approach in which we intend
to explore ED relation to ANS dysfunctions. To this end

by stress, EEG headsets8,9 (Emotiv, 2019) already used
in arousal studies and attention, eye tracking glasses for
monitoring blinking and pupil dilatation10,11 , and hormonal
sensing (Stanford EDU, 2018).
With the stress task presented we tried to assess broad set
of test situations, nonetheless other variables could have been
studied depending on the need to answer specific questions, e.g.,
emotion perception could be assessed in response to pictures
from the International Affective Picture System (Joos et al., 2009;
Gorini et al., 2010).

we designed a comprehensive protocol and successfully
implemented it in a study in which we include physiological
parameters from ECG, SC, and skin temperature. Participants
are studied during the period of 1 day, with the expectation
that longitudinal data can provide further insights than
cross-sectional data. Recordings take place both in a lab
session that calibrate individual physiological responses
to different stressors, as well as in ambulatory, allowing
participants to do the activities of their choice while the
electrophysiological measurements are stored. At the time this
article was written, we had collected data on 37 clinical subjects
and 16 controls. Ongoing work focus on the implementation
of a complete processing pipeline for data analysis and
on the quantitative validation of our hypothesis using the
collected dataset.

Relevance
In the clinical context the evolution assessment of psychiatric
patients relies mainly on self-reports and clinical observation.
Information gaps between sparse appointments–when there is
no hospital admission—are often bridged based on the patient
reports, a recollection exercise that can be affected by momentary
altered mental states. In ED, BMI is routinely measured to verify
if weight goals are achieved, while cardiovascular assessment and
blood analysis may be requested when the physical state of the
patient is dubious. In these circumstances, most information
gathered about the patient is sparse and subjective, often collected
in a non-standardized way. In this backdrop, there is a recognized
need for methodological enhancements in the field of mental
health management. Nevertheless, in the past decades no major
developments have been registered.

Design Limitations and Notes for
Future Enhancement
While the study design presents advantages over a cross-sectional
one, because it includes continuous recording over about 8 h,
the collection time can be still considered limited. While 1 day
of data is enough to test our hypothesis, we cannot exclude
punctual factors, not representative of the day to day life of the
individual. In future research, conversion of the paper diary into
an app and synchronized sensors data streaming directly to a
cloud infrastructure, will reduce experimental burdens both for
the participants and for the researchers allowing also for longer
data collection period and even for easier implementation in
clinical practice.
In what comes to physiological sensing, new noninvasive wearables methods have been recently developed
that can be used in future trials to complement or
substitute the current devices, for example multi-sensor
wrist devices6 for HR, SC, and temperature monitoring,

Quantifying Eating Disorders’ Psychopathology

ETHICS STATEMENT

Recently mental health management sprouted attention
outside medical and human sciences. This followed the
technological developments that led to miniaturization of
wireless sensing platforms, enhanced remote communications,
increased computational power, and their broad availability to
end users. The resulting enhanced possibilities for data collection
and processing became an enabling factor for continuous
follow-up and multifactorial analysis—seemingly matching the
challenges of mental health management. Currently, there is
a crescent interest and openness of the psychiatric research
community to technology aided mental health management.
Nonetheless, the topic is still highly enfolded in speculation and
ethical concerns, and solid outcomes need to arise before the
clinical community is convinced to adopt new technologies as an
integral part of their methods.
If our hypothesis holds, we can further the understanding of
psychopathology across ED and help establishing a dimensional
biologically oriented nosology. For design reasons our study
focuses on the treatment phase, when the patient has already
reached the healthcare system. Which is nonetheless, a valid
phase to introduce aiding technologies, namely, to help
determining the patient psychopathological state, and track it
during follow-up, toward modulating the treatment at each step.

This study was carried out in accordance with the
recommendations of the Commissie Medische Ethiek,
UZ Leuven and in accordance to the Belgian law of 7
of May 2004 with written informed consent from all
subjects. All subjects gave written informed consent
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The
protocol was approved by the Commissie Medische Ethiek,
UZ Leuven.
