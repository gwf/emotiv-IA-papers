Background: The use of consumer-grade electroencephalography (EEG) systems for
research purposes has become more prevalent. In event-related potential (ERP)
research, it is critical that these systems have precise and accurate timing. The aim of
the current study was to investigate the timing reliability of event-marking solutions
used with Emotiv commercial EEG systems.
Method: We conducted three experiments. In Experiment 1 we established a jitter
threshold (i.e. the point at which jitter made an event-marking method unreliable).
To do this, we introduced statistical noise to the temporal position of event-marks of
a pre-existing ERP dataset (recorded with a research-grade system, Neuroscan
SynAmps2 at 1,000 Hz using parallel-port event-marking) and calculated the level
at which the waveform peaks differed statistically from the original waveform.
In Experiment 2 we established a method to identify ‘true’ events (i.e. when an event
should appear in the EEG data). We did this by inserting 1,000 events into Neuroscan
data using a custom-built event-marking system, the ‘Airmarker’, which marks
events by triggering voltage spikes in two EEG channels. We used the lag between
Airmarker events and events generated by Neuroscan as a reference for comparisons
in Experiment 3. In Experiment 3 we measured the precision and accuracy of
three types of Emotiv event-marking by generating 1,000 events, 1 s apart.
We measured precision as the variability (standard deviation in ms) of Emotiv
events and accuracy as the mean difference between Emotiv events and true events.
The three triggering methods we tested were: (1) Parallel-port-generated TTL
triggers; (2) Arduino-generated TTL triggers; and (3) Serial-port triggers. In Methods
1 and 2 we used an auxiliary device, Emotiv Extender, to incorporate triggers into the
EEG data. We tested these event-marking methods across three conﬁgurations of
Emotiv EEG systems: (1) Emotiv EPOC+ sampling at 128 Hz; (2) Emotiv EPOC+
sampling at 256 Hz; and (3) Emotiv EPOC Flex sampling at 128 Hz.
Results: In Experiment 1 we found that the smaller P1 and N1 peaks were attenuated
at lower levels of jitter relative to the larger P2 peak (21 ms, 16 ms, and 45 ms for P1,
N1, and P2, respectively). In Experiment 2, we found an average lag of 30.96 ms
for Airmarker events relative to Neuroscan events. In Experiment 3, we found
some lag in all conﬁgurations. However, all conﬁgurations exhibited precision of less
than a single sample, with serial-port-marking the most precise when paired with
EPOC+ sampling at 256 Hz.
Conclusion: All Emotiv event-marking methods and conﬁgurations that we tested
were precise enough for ERP research as the precision of each method would provide

INTRODUCTION
The use of consumer-grade electroencephalography (EEG) devices has increased markedly
in recent years. EEG devices measure the voltage of electrical ﬁelds generated when
neurones ﬁre and whereas early EEG systems were cumbersome and expensive, newer
systems have become smaller and cheaper. This is particularly true of commercial-grade
EEG. These systems have lowered the ﬁnancial barrier to neuroscientiﬁc research and,
due to their portable nature, allowed studies to move outside the laboratory into more
naturalistic settings, such as the classroom (see Xu & Zhong (2018) for a review). Even
when used in a laboratory, commercial EEG systems can streamline data collection as the
setup is often quicker and simpler than traditional EEG systems.
Research techniques that were once possible only with expensive EEG setups are now
achievable using low-cost alternatives (Sawangjai et al., 2020; Williams, McArthur &
Badcock, 2020). One of these techniques is the event-related potential (ERP) approach.
An ERP is the average electrical potential generated by large groups of neurons in response
to a particular event. It is measured by recording a person’s EEG during the repeated
occurrence of a stimulus and then isolating the EEG into discrete sections of time, or
epochs. These epochs contain the neural response of interest to each individual event and
are averaged together to produce an ERP (see Fig. 1B, for a typical auditory ERP).
A number of studies have validated commercial-grade EEG devices for ERP research
by comparing their performance to research-grade systems (see Sawangjai et al., 2020
for a review). Overall, the results have been encouraging. For example, Krigolson et al.
(2017) found that a MUSE EEG system could measure ERP components in a visual oddball
and a reward-learning task. Similarly, Emotiv’s EPOC system was found to measure
research-grade auditory ERPs in adults (Badcock et al., 2013) and children (Badcock et al.,
2015); as well as visual ERPs in response to faces (De Lissa et al., 2015). Recently, Williams
et al. (2020) found analogous results for the Emotiv EPOC Flex system. The fact that
EEG systems in this class cost a fraction of the price of research systems makes them an
appealing alternative to researchers for ‘acquiring research-grade ERPs on a shoestring
budget’ (Barham et al., 2017).
To capitalise on the ERP technique, it is critical to know exactly when a stimulus occurs.
This is because the EEG signal of interest occurs very quickly following the stimulus—
often under 300 ms. To accurately represent the signal requires a method of incorporating
precise stimulus timestamps, or events, into EEG data in order to isolate epochs. If events
are inserted at the wrong time, then the epochs do not represent the desired signal.
Further, if events are inserted at varying incorrect times relative to the stimulus then the

result is often severely degraded or non-existent ERPs (see Fig. 1B for an example of a
degraded waveform).
Before going further, we address the use of the terms ‘trigger’ and ‘event’ in ERP
research. Many studies use the two terms interchangeably. However, for clarity we draw a
distinction. We use the term ‘trigger’ to denote the production of some signal (e.g. TTL
pulse) that is indicative of the time a stimulus occurred and is transmitted to the EEG
data. We use the term ‘event’ to denote the timestamped incorporation of that signal into
the data. Thus, an experimental stimulus script (e.g. MATLAB) generates a trigger
(e.g. TTL pulse), which is then received as an event in the EEG data.
An obstacle in ERP research using commercial-grade EEG devices is time-locking the
stimulus with the EEG data to derive ERP components. This is because these systems were

not designed for ERP research and often do not have in-built methods for event-marking.
Even in cases in which there exist event-marking solutions, the results can be inconsistent.
For example in early iterations of Emotiv software researchers have found that serialport-based event-marking was unreliable and did not produce quality ERPs (Hairston,
2012; Ries et al., 2014). Researchers have attempted to circumvent this problem using
various methods. Some have used ofﬂine processing techniques such as regression-based
timing correction of triggers (Akimoto & Takano, 2018; Whitaker & Hairston, 2012), or
using the timestamps from the log ﬁles of the stimulus scripts (Hairston, 2012; Ries
et al., 2014). Others have approached this issue by using a custom-built event-marking
system (the ‘Airmarker’) that converted an audio or visual stimulus into an infrared light
pulse (Thie, 2013). This pulse was then transmitted to a custom-built receiver mounted on
a portable EEG device (Emotiv EPOC in this case) and injected into two of the EEG
channels (for a full description of procedure and equipment see Badcock et al. (2015),
Thie (2013)). Events were thus visualised as distinct voltage spike in the EEG signal
and timing of the events was calculated according to the onset of the spikes. While this
approach yielded ERPs, it required post-processing and the sacriﬁce of two EEG channels.
Thus, a dedicated system that incorporates events directly into EEG data would be
preferable to an alternative that requires fabrication of a custom device, modiﬁcation to an
EEG system, and substantial post-processing.
Though previous iterations of Emotiv EEG acquisition software were unreliable for
event-marking, the situation may be improved by developments in hardware and software.
Hardware-based event-marking can now be achieved using a device called Extender.
Likewise, serial-port event-marking is purported to be more reliable with version 2 of
Emotiv Pro software relative to earlier Emotiv acquisition software such as Testbench or
Emotiv Pro version 1. While these options promise to deliver synchronisation of stimulus
presentation and EEG data, their reliability is untested.
For an event-marking system to reliably produce ERPs, it must be both accurate and
precise. Accuracy refers to the time difference between when an event is received in the
EEG data (e.g. parallel-port code received) and when the respective stimulus actually
occurs (e.g. audio tone is emitted from a speaker). This is often referred to as the ‘lag’.
Precision refers to the variability in the accuracy of the event-mark and is often referred
to as ‘jitter’. As an example, consider a system that generates audio tones and in which
the event-mark consistently appears in the EEG data 20 ms after the sound comes out of a
speaker. This 20 ms difference is considered the lag and can easily be accounted for during
post-processing by subtracting 20 ms from each event. However, if the difference is
sometimes 12 ms, sometimes 27 ms, sometimes 33 ms, etc., this is considered imprecise, or
‘jittery’, timing. Jittery timing is difﬁcult to correct as the difference between the stimulus
and event-mark is unknown from trial to trial. A jittery event-marking system is
problematic for deriving ERPs as it may distort the averaged component. For example,
Hairston (2012) simulated the effect of 55 ms of timing jitter on an ERP and found that
the waveform was almost entirely attenuated. Likewise, a study by Ries et al. (2014)
presented results from an Emotiv device with jittery event-marking that showed severe

waveform degradation compared to the waveform when the timing was corrected. Thus,
ERP researchers can account for inaccurate triggers but not for imprecise ones.
Though jitter in an event-marking system is more problematic than inaccuracy, it is
easier to measure. It can be quantiﬁed as the variability (e.g. standard deviation) of known
inter-trial intervals (the time difference between the events). For example, if successive
stimuli are presented 1,000 ms apart, then a perfect system would exhibit a mean intertrial interval of 1,000 ms and a standard deviation of 0 ms. This would indicate that each
event was recorded precisely 1,000 ms after the preceding event.
Accuracy, though less problematic than imprecision, is more difﬁcult to measure.
This is because one must know when an event should occur in the EEG data in order to
compare when the event actually does occur. That is, how closely in time does the actual
event match up to the EEG signal of interest. There are various methods for assessing
accuracy but most include inserting some stimulus-related signal into the EEG.
One example is inserting the signal from a microphone positioned by a speaker into an
EEG channel. This would provide a visual reference in the EEG of when the stimulus
(e.g. audio tone) occurred.
With these considerations in mind, the aim of this study was to quantify the timing of
Emotiv hardware and software used for ERP research. We conducted three experiments
in which we examined both the accuracy and precision of event-marking timing.
In Experiment 1, we established a jitter threshold by introducing temporal noise into
the events-marks of a pre-existing, exemplary ERP dataset (Badcock et al., 2013) collected
with a research-grade EEG system, Neuroscan, and calculating the jitter levels at which the
ERP waveform peaks were statistically different to the exemplar.
In Experiment 2, we benchmarked a method, for use in Experiment 3, to assess the
accuracy of Emotiv event-marking. As previously noted, assessing the accuracy of
event-marking entails measuring the time difference between when an event should occur
and when it actually does occur. This is problematic as it requires something to
represent the ‘true’ event. We approached this problem by measuring the lag of Airmarker
events relative to a research-grade system, Neuroscan with parallel-port event-marking.
We attributed this lag to Airmarker processing time and subtracted it from Airmarker
events in Experiment 3 to calculate the true event times (i.e. when an event should have
occurred; See Fig. 2).
In Experiment 3, we measured the precision of both hardware-based (i.e. Emotiv
Extender) and software-based (i.e. serial port) events. We used the thresholds established
in Experiment 1 to determine whether the event-marking methods were sufﬁciently
precise. To assess accuracy, we compared Emotiv events to true event times, which were
calculated as simultaneously-generated Airmarker events minus the average lag calculated
in Experiment 2.

EXPERIMENT 1: ESTABLISHING JITTER THRESHOLDS
The purpose of Experiment 1 was to determine the tolerance of an ERP to jitter.
To investigate this, we used a single pre-existing dataset selected because it exhibited a

classic auditory ERP with standard P1, N1, and P2 peaks. We then incrementally
introduced random noise, or jitter, into the event-marks. This allowed us to calculate jitter
thresholds by establishing the tolerance of an ERP waveform to timing imprecision.

Materials and Methods
An EEG dataﬁle was taken from an auditory oddball validation study (for complete details
see, Badcock et al., 2013) in which participants heard 666 tones. Of these, 566 were
standard (1,000 Hz) and 100 were deviant (1,200 Hz) 175 ms pure tones, with an
inter-tone onset interval that randomly varied between 900 and 1,100 ms. Participants
watched a silent DVD while listening to tones. EEG data were collected with Neuroscan
SynAmps2 using Scan software (4.3), recorded at 1,000 Hz from 16 electrodes: F3, F7, FC4,
FT7, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FT8, FC4, F8, F4, M1 (online reference), and M2; with VEOG
and HEOG; and the ground at AFz. The tone onset was marked in the EEG data via
parallel port using Presentation (version 16; Neurobehavioral System Inc., Berkeley, CA,
USA).

Processing and analysis
We used a single electrode for the current purposes, F3, selected for having a clear ERP
waveform. We selected an individual with clearly deﬁned P1, N1, and P2 peaks in response
to standard tones. The processing was conducted as in Badcock et al. (2013) with the
exception that the data were not downsampled (processing included 0.1 and 30 Hz
bandpass ﬁlters, independent components analysis removal of eye-blink artefacts,
epoching −100 to 600 relative to tone onset, and baseline correction). All processing was
conducted with EEGLAB 14.1.0b (Delorme & Makeig, 2004). Epoching and baseline
correction were repeated at different levels of temporal jitter of the parallel-port event
mark. A value of 0 reﬂects no adjustment. We then jittered the temporal position of the
events by generating a normal distribution with a standard deviation of increasing values
from 1 to 50 ms in 1 ms intervals. This resulted in 50 discrete jitter levels. To remove
any potential EEG artefacts, a cut-off of activation beyond ±150 mV was set for epoch
exclusion. No epochs were excluded at any jitter level. Peak magnitudes were determined
using an automated method that selected peak values within the following time periods:
P1, 36-96; N1, 75-135; P2, 140-200 ms (eventMark_EEGLAB_processing4erps.m;
https://osf.io/pj9k3/). These reﬂected intervals of ±30 ms either side of the peak time-point
for the 0 jitter waveform to the standard tone.
To calculate jitter thresholds, we performed a series of Bayesian t-tests for each peak
(i.e. P1, N1, P2). These tests compared the distributions of peak values at each jitter
level to the distribution of peak values of the original waveform (i.e. zero-jitter). For each
peak, we deemed the threshold to be the smallest jitter level point at which the Bayes Factor
exceeded a value of 3. This indicated substantial evidence that the respective peak value
was statistically different from the original (Jarosz & Wiley, 2014).

Results and Discussion
Figure 1A shows the distribution of peak means at each level of jitter. The jitter thresholds
differed for each of the peaks: P1 was statistically different from the original at 21 ms
of jitter, BF10 = 9.63; N1 was statistically different from the original at 16 ms of jitter,
BF10 = 4.92; and P2 was statistically different from the original at 45 ms of jitter,
BF10 = 20.19. Figure 1B shows the waveforms produced by increasing levels of jitter.
Overall, these results suggest that larger auditory ERP peaks are more resilient to jitter,
whereas smaller peaks are more easily attenuated. Further, these ﬁndings provide levels at
which event-marking devices become too jittery for ERP research. We note that these
values should be considered guidelines and not be interpreted as absolute precision
thresholds. For the purposes of the current study, they represented values against which we
could compare subsequent timing analyses.

and accuracy of an event-marking system previously used in our lab (Badcock et al., 2015),
the Airmarker. Data, the triggering script, and processing and analysis scripts may be
found at https://osf.io/pj9k3/.

Methods
The triggering script was run on a Dell Precision T3620 computer running Windows
10 version 1607. We used a custom-written MATLAB (version R2017b) script that
included the Psychtoolbox plugin (Brainard, 1997; Kleiner et al., 2007; Pelli, 1997) and a
plugin to interface with the parallel-port hardware (http://apps.usd.edu/coglab/psyc770/
IO32.html).
The script generated 1,000 events, each 1,000 ms apart. There were two types of events: a
parallel-port code sent through a Sunix LPT PCI card and a 1,000 Hz audio tone sent
through a 3.5 mm audio output port. The parallel port trigger went to the Neuroscan
ampliﬁer where it was incorporated as an event into the EEG data. The audio tone fed
into the Airmarker transmitter and was converted to an infrared signal that was received
by the Airmarker receiver and converted to a square electrical wave. We attached the
positive and negative Airmarker receiver wires to a bipolar electrode of the Neuroscan
system (VEOG). We used a Neuroscan Synamps2 system at a 1,000 Hz sampling rate to
collect EEG data to Curry acquisition software (version 7; compumedicsneuroscan.com)
on a Dell Optiplex 7760 computer running Windows 10 version 1809. See Fig. 3 for a
schematic of the triggering setup.

Processing and analysis
Electroencephalography data were imported using EEGLAB (Delorme & Makeig, 2004).
To derive Airmarker triggers we wrote a custom MATLAB script that calculated the
absolute value of the EEG channel derivative and then set a threshold of +3 standard
deviations above the derivative mean. Within the time-window of 200 ms following each
parallel-port trigger, the script identiﬁed the ﬁrst sample in which the Airmarker EEG
derivative exceeded the threshold. The time point of each of these samples was considered
an Airmarker event. We then calculated inter-trial intervals for each event type (parallelport and Airmarker, independently) as the time between adjacent events. Precision, or
jitter, was thus quantiﬁed as the variability (i.e. standard deviation) of the inter-trial
intervals within each event type. We quantiﬁed lag as the average difference between
Neuroscan parallel-port events and Airmarker events. See Fig. 4 for an example of a
three-trial sequence of Airmarker EEG signal and derived events with annotations
depicting inter-trial intervals and lag.

RESULTS
Table 1 shows the timing performance in Experiment 2 (and 3). We observed
sub-millisecond precision with respect to the parallel-port trigger (Fig. 5A). The Airmarker
trigger was slightly less precise (Inter-trial interval SD = 3.49 ms), though was well below
the thresholds established in Experiment 1. On average, Airmarker triggers appeared in

ms units) of the inter-trial intervals. Lag was calculated as the average time difference (in ms) between the tested event-marking systems and ‘true’
events. True events were calculated as Airmarker times minus Airmarker processing time (30.96 ms). Negative lag values indicate events arrived
earlier than true events in the data, whereas positive lag values indicate events arrived later than true events in the data.

for parallel-port triggers in the Neuroscan conﬁguration, we considered 30.96 ms the
processing lag associated with the Airmarker and subtracted this calculation from
Airmarker lag times in each conﬁguration in Experiment 3. This allowed us to examine the
accuracy of Emotiv event-marking.

EXPERIMENT 3: EMOTIV AND AIRMARKER TRIGGERING
The purpose of Experiment 3 was to examine the accuracy and precision of ERP triggers
with Emotiv EEG hardware. To do this, we tested three event-marking methods:
(1) a parallel-port-generated TTL trigger sent to Emotiv Extender hardware (Extender);
(2) an Arduino-generated TTL trigger sent to Extender; and (3) a serial-port-code
trigger sent directly to the acquisition computer. For each of these methods we tested three
Emotiv EEG conﬁgurations: (1) Emotiv EPOC+ (EPOC) at 128 Hz sampling rate;
(2) EPOC at 256 Hz sampling rate; and (3) Emotiv EPOC Flex (Flex) at 128 Hz sampling
rate. Data, the triggering script, and processing and analysis scripts may be found at
https://osf.io/pj9k3/.

Methods
The stimulus and acquisition computers were the same as in Experiment 2. We also used
the same triggering script as Experiment 2 in which audio-tone triggers were sent to
Airmarker. To incorporate Airmarker events into the Emotiv EEG data, we used the same
procedure as in previous validation studies (Badcock et al., 2013, 2015; De Lissa et al.,
2015). We connected the receiver wires to two channels of the Emotiv device and biased
them to the driven-right-leg (DRL) channel using a second set of wires that included a

connected head circuit and obtain a clean EEG signal. See Fig. 6 for a schematic of the
parallel-port trigger (A), Arduino Uno trigger (B), and serial-port trigger (C),

For the TTL triggering, we wrote a switch into the MATLAB code that depended
on triggering method (i.e. parallel port, Arduino, or serial port). The exact setup varied for
each conﬁguration, and each is described below. In each case, we generated 1,000 triggers,

1,000 ms apart. All EEG data were acquired using Emotiv Pro (2.3.0). The triggering script
may be found at https://osf.io/pj9k3/.
Parallel port to extender
To generate parallel-port TTL triggers, we used the same plugin as in Experiment 2. TTL
triggers were transmitted using a custom-built parallel-port-to-BNC adapter that carried
the pulse from a single parallel-port pin to a 2.5 mm tip-ring-sleeve jack plugged into
Extender. The event was then incorporated into the Emotiv device data (i.e. EPOC or Flex)
by a USB cable where it was transmitted via Bluetooth to the acquisition computer.
Arduino to extender
For the Arduino to Extender testing we used the MATLAB Support Pack for Arduino
Hardware (https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/ﬁleexchange/47522-matlab-supportpackage-for-arduino-hardware) that interfaced with an Arduino Uno (https://arduino.cc).
Triggers were achieved by sending a digital pin output command to the Arduino,
which then sent a TTL pulse to a 2.5 mm tip-ring-sleeve jack plugged into Extender.
As before, the event was then incorporated into the Emotiv EEG data and transmitted to
the acquisition computer via Bluetooth.

Serial port
To generate serial-port-code triggers, we used native MATLAB functions. The trigger was
sent from a serial port to a virtual serial-port USB adapter on the acquisition computer.
Serial-port events were then incorporated directly into the Emotiv EEG data in Emotiv
Pro.

Processing and analysis
Electroencephalography data were imported using EEGLAB (Delorme & Makeig, 2004).
We ﬁrst calculated the number of dropped samples in each conﬁguration. We did this
because wireless EEG systems, like EPOC and Flex, can sometimes experience
interference that results in incomplete data transmission. To calculate the number of
dropped samples, we counted the number of instances in which a value of ‘1’ appeared in
the ‘INTERPOLATION’ channel. This indicates that the acquisition software did not
receive a sample and thus interpolated EEG channel values according to temporallyadjacent channel values. We also calculated the number of times dropped samples resulted
in missed triggers. Though it was rare, this situation did arise in two conﬁgurations.
We again calculated the inter-trial intervals for each of the primary triggering
methods and used the standard deviation as a measure of precision. In the conﬁgurations
where a trigger was missed, we removed the affected inter-trial intervals before calculating
timing numbers.
We calculated Airmarker events identically to Experiment 2, using the +3 standard
deviation above the mean method. For each conﬁguration we also calculated a measure
of accuracy by ﬁrst determining the true event time. The true event time was calculated
by subtracting 30.96 ms (i.e. the Airmarker processing time measured observed in
Experiment 2) from Airmarker events (see Fig. 2). Emotiv event-marking accuracy was
then calculated as the average time difference between Emotiv events and the true events.

RESULTS
Table 1 shows the timing results. Overall, Emotiv triggering systems were well below
Experiment 1 thresholds. To compare jitter between triggering systems within each device
conﬁguration, we performed Levene’s tests of equality of variance on the inter-trial
intervals with follow-up pairwise comparisons (Bonferroni corrected for the number of
comparisons) where we detected signiﬁcant results. Results of the EPOC 128 Hz
conﬁguration indicated signiﬁcant differences in variances (F = 3.15, p = 0.043).
However, none of the follow-up tests achieved signiﬁcance at the corrected a = 0.016 level
(all Fs < 5.56, all p > 0.018). Results of the EPOC 256 Hz conﬁguration indicated a
signiﬁcant difference in variances (F = 134.48, p < 0.001). All follow-up tests were
signiﬁcant at the corrected level (all Fs > 27.75, all p < 0.001) suggesting that the serial-port
event-marking was the most precise, followed by parallel-port event-marking, and then
Arduino-triggered event-marking. The results of the Flex conﬁguration were also
signiﬁcant (F = 17.78, p < 0.001) with follow-up tests suggesting that Arduino
triggering was more jittery than both parallel-port (F = 27.79, p < 0.001) and serial-port
(F = 21.89, p < 0.001) event-marking. There was no difference between parallel-port and

serial-port event-marking (F = 0.42, p = 0.518). Overall, these results suggested that
serial-port event-marking with EPOC at 256 Hz sampling rate was the most precise
conﬁguration. We note, however, that all conﬁgurations exhibited jitter of less than a
single sample. See Figs. 5B and 5C for distributions of inter-trial intervals for each
conﬁguration.
All conﬁgurations exhibited some level of inaccuracy (see Table 1). This lag indicated
the difference between the event timestamp (i.e. when the stimulus was said to have
occurred) and the EEG data of interest (i.e. when the Airmarker signal appeared in the
EEG). We provide the calculations here for reference but note that we did not perform
statistical tests on the lag measure for two reasons. The ﬁrst is that the variance of this
calculation is directly impacted by the precision of the event-marking trigger, which
we assessed above. The second is that we do not want to give the impression that this
measure would be identical in the setups of prospective users. We stress that researchers
should test the accuracy of their respective conﬁgurations.

DISCUSSION
In this study we examined the timing performance of event-marking solutions used with
Emotiv EEG systems. We ﬁrst established jitter thresholds by introducing noise into an
exemplary ERP dataset and determining at which level the waveform was attenuated to the
extent that it no longer resembled the original. We then benchmarked a custom-built
event-marking system known to produce valid ERPs (i.e. the Airmarker; Thie, 2013).
Finally, we used this system to identify when events should appear in the data in order to
assess the timing performance of the Emotiv triggering systems.
Our ﬁrst main ﬁnding was that large peaks in our ERPs were more resilient to jitter
attenuation than were the smaller peaks. In Experiment 1, it took twice as much jitter
to attenuate the large P2 peak as it did to attenuate the smaller P1 and N1 peaks. It is
notable that jitter did not change the timing of the peaks. Rather, it suppressed the
amplitude of the peaks and distorted the slopes. This is a similar pattern to previous
work in which Hairston (2012) reported the effects of timing jitter on a simulated ERP.
Naturally, we would not expect the thresholds we calculated in Experiment 1 to identically
correspond to data collected from other individuals. Inter-individual variation in EEG
signatures would certainly create idiosyncratic jitter levels of waveform attenuation.
For example, data from individuals with smaller peaks would be more susceptible to
waveform degradation. Likewise, other experimental factors such as high-frequency noise
would inﬂuence jitter-induced attenuation.
Our second main ﬁnding was the Emotiv event-marking systems we tested were
precise, with all conﬁgurations showing less than a sample of jitter. We deemed these
systems sufﬁciently precise for ERP research based on the thresholds we established in
Experiment 1. We note, however, that these thresholds were based on the ERP data from a
task that produces a very robust waveform. The precision thresholds would likely vary
depending on the ERP being examined. Short-latency ERPs, such as auditory brainstem
responses, would be particularly susceptible to jitter-induced attenuation as they
typically occur in the ﬁrst 10 ms following stimulus onset with peaks lasting 1–2 ms each

(Luck, 2014). However, given that the maximum sampling rate of the equipment we
tested was 256 Hz, the capacity to measure auditory brainstem responses would not be
limited by event-marking precision but rather by the EEG hardware. For most long-latency
responses (i.e. those over 50 ms), the conﬁgurations we tested in this study would sufﬁce.
We also found that the accuracy of event-marking systems varied, though
conﬁgurations involving Extender all showed lag between 51 and 58 ms. This is in line with
Extender performance expectations as the manufacturer indicates a ‘…ﬁxed 60ms delay
between the trigger and the channel signal data which is due to the ﬁlter delay for the
channels.’ (https://emotiv.gitbook.io/extender-manual/hardware_triggering). Although
inaccuracy is not ideal, the low levels of jitter observed across the conﬁgurations would
make timing correction straightforward for ERP researchers. In line with this we note
that while we provide precision and accuracy values in Table 1, we do so for reference only.
We tested these systems on only one computer setup. As computer hardware and software
could feasibly inﬂuence performance, we suggest that researchers employing these
event-marking systems benchmark their respective setups.

CONCLUSION
All Emotiv event-marking conﬁgurations we tested were suitably precise for research
involving long-latency ERPs. Though all conﬁgurations were somewhat inaccurate, these
inaccuracies can easily be accounted for during data processing. We note that although
we provide precision and accuracy calculations for these speciﬁc Emotiv event-marking
solutions, we suggest researchers measure the precision and accuracy of their
respective setups.
Beyond timing precision and accuracy, there are other considerations for researchers
choosing an event-marking solution. These include ﬁnancial limitations, hardware and
software conﬁgurations, and ease-of-use. For example, dedicated trigger boxes used with
high-end research-grade EEG setups will likely be extraordinarily precise. However, they
may be prohibitively expensive for some. Likewise, Emotiv EEG event-marking can be
achieved using custom-built equipment (e.g. Airmarker) or by interfacing directly with the
software through a custom application programming interface. Either of these options
requires signiﬁcant expertise that some researchers may not have available. Given that
serial-port event-making was among the most precision solutions in the current study, we
would recommend it for researchers using Emotiv EEG as it best balances convenience,
usability, and precision.
