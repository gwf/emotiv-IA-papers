Abstract
To examine whether it was possible to improve short-term memory performance of healthy participants by
increasing relative alpha band power (7–11.5 Hz) using neurofeedback, we first converted a commercial EEG
device (EmotivEpoc) to a neurofeedback tool and collected data from 11 healthy Turkish male graduate students
in five neurofeedback sessions. Before and after neurofeedback training, a memorization task using 10 English
words and their Turkish meanings was applied to all participants. The results indicated that 6 out of 11
participants were able to enhance their relative alpha band power with respect to other bands in the frequency
spectrum during neurofeedback sessions. Although there was no obvious improvement in their short-term
memory performance, we may conclude that neurofeedback training was beneficial for the participants to focus
their minds consciously. However, it is not easy to mention that neurofeedback training certainly improved or
was irrelevant with short-term memory performance. This study is important in the sense that for such a focused
group the use of a commercial, customized low-cost EEG device was shown to be feasible for neurofeedback
training sessions.

Introduction
It is a fact that human physical and psychological
functions start to degrade with aging, which causes a
significant decrease in life quality (Wang & Hsieh,
2013). Considering all the cognitive functions of the
brain, memory is likely to be one of the most important
cognitive abilities for individuals to sustain their life
quality and productivity.
Klimesch, Doppelmayr, Pachinger & Ripper (1997)
reported that there was a relationship between
memory performance and the alpha band activity.
When an individual’s resting-state alpha activity was
high, long-term memory performance was also high
(Klimesch, 1999). Besides that, it was reported that
not only alpha activity is related with memory but also
some other bands’ activities are related to memory
performance (Reis et al., 2016). Wang and Hsieh
15 | www.neuroregulation.org

(2013) reported that frontal-midline theta band
enhancement improves working memory and
attention.
Vernon et al. (2003) reported that
enhancement of sensorimotor rhythm (SMR; 12–15
Hz) activity improves working memory performance.
Although there are many reports that memory
performance is associated with alpha activity, Bauer
(1976) studied whether increasing (8.5–12.5 Hz)
alpha activity improves recall performance, but he
could not observe such a relationship for short-term
memory.
Neurofeedback training (NFT) method gives subjects
audio/visual feedback of their brain wave activity so
that they can learn to control their own brain rhythm.
In addition, it has been studied for several decades
as an alternative to traditional medication for some
psychological disorders
such as attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; Friel, 2007),

substance addiction (Sokhadze, Cannon, & Trudeau,
2008), epilepsy (Sterman & Egner, 2006), and autism
(Coben, Linden, & Myers, 2010). NFT has also been
used to enhance the cognitive performance of healthy
participants. Besides its function in psychological
disorders, NFT has been shown to have some
positive effects on cognitive performance of healthy
individuals having different occupations, for example,
musicians and surgeons (Gruzelier, Egner & Vernon,
2006; Ros et al., 2009). Although there are many
studies which support that NFT has positive effects
on some areas including cognitive performance
improvement using alpha band power (Marzbani,
Marateb, & Mansourian, 2016), there are limited
studies which show the effects of NFT on short-term
memory in the literature (Conway, Cowan, Bunting,
Therriault & Minkoff, 2002).

could increase alpha band power and improve
working memory performance.

Lecomte and Juhel (2011) investigated whether
increasing upper alpha band (10–12 Hz) power over
theta band (4–7 Hz) power could improve short-term
memory performance or not.
In their
electroencephalography (EEG) experiments, C3, C4,
and Cz (ref) electrodes were used, and an audiovisual feedback was employed.
After four
neurofeedback training sessions, they showed that
subjects could increase alpha band power and
alpha/theta band power, however, there was no
memory performance improvement in elderly
participants. Kober et al. (2015) examined whether
increasing the SMR (12–15 Hz) band power or upper
alpha (10–12 Hz) band power could improve shortterm memory performance in post-stroke patients. In
EEG experiments, Cz electrode was used for SMR,
Pz electrode was used for upper-alpha training, and
a visual feedback was employed.
After 10
neurofeedback training sessions, they showed that
participants who took the SMR training were able to
improve their visuospatial short-term memory
performance. Moreover, participants who took the
upper-alpha training could improve their working
memory performance. Nan et al. (2012) investigated
the potential of increase in the individual alpha band
power to improve the short-term memory
performance. In the experiments, only Cz electrode
was used, and a visual feedback was employed.
After 20 neurofeedback training sessions, they
showed that participants could increase their
individual alpha band power and improve the shortterm memory performance. Finally, Wang (2017)
examined whether increasing the alpha band power
could improve the working memory performance in
the students with ADHD. In EEG experiments, only
FCz electrode was used. After 10 neurofeedback
training sessions, he showed that the participants

Participants
The 11 subjects who participated in the experiments
were chosen among male graduate students, with an
average age of 29 and with standard deviation of
±3.04. One participant was left-handed and five of
them wore glasses. For the experiment, there was no
payment to the participants except for a chocolate bar
for every session.
Before experiments, written
approval from Abdullah Gül University Internal
Review Board and oral consent from participants
were received.

In this study, we first converted a wireless EEG device
(Emotiv EPOC) to a neurofeedback tool. Later, we
examined whether it was possible to improve shortterm memory performance of 11 healthy participants
by increasing relative alpha band power using
neurofeedback training. Before and after 5 days of
neurofeedback training sessions, we measured the
improvement on participants’ short-term memory by
performing a test that consisted of memorizing and
recalling the Turkish meanings of some English
words which were not previously known by the
participants.

Materials and Methods

EEG Recordings
During the experiments the setup shown in Figure 1
of the Emotiv EPOC system, a 14-channel wireless
EEG device with 128-Hz sampling frequency, was
used.
According to Emotiv manufacturer, the
“measurement accuracy of the device is technically:
minimum voltage resolution 0.51 V, 14-bit accuracy,
0.2–43 Hz bandwidth” (“How Accurate Is Your
Detection”, 2019).
The voltage resolution was
suitable to measure EEG signals, because the EEG
signal varied around a voltage level that was above
±10V. The reference electrodes were placed on the
left and right mastoids. Another important component
of the EEG recoding was the real-time signal
acquisition and processing of the brain waves. For
this purpose we first installed MATLAB 2012b (32-bit
version) to our computer and Visual C++ 2010 to
compile MATLAB. Later, we used the modified
version of a MATLAB file called “eeglogger.m” that
was developed and shared by the manufacturer of the
wireless headset. By means of the modifications we
were able to convert the system into a neurofeedback
tool (necessary files can be found as supplementary
materials). In this work we used only P8 electrode
(according to the international 10–20 system),

because it was one of the suitable places to record
the signals without getting affected from the
eyeblinks.

Figure 1. Experimental setup.

Study Design
Before the neurofeedback training sessions were
started, a baseline EEG measurement obtained with
eyes open and a pretraining test was given to the
participants to be able to measure short-term memory
performance of the participants. The pretraining test
included 10 words such as exigency, innocuous, and

desultory, which were not known by the participants
beforehand.
Firstly, the participants were let
memorize the words by looking at the selected words
shown one by one on the screen followed by its
meaning. There was no time limit in this part. Once
the memorization part was over, it was requested
from each participant to remember the meanings
when each English word was shown on the screen.
No multiple-choice type approach was followed.
Memorization time, recall time, and the number of
accurately recalled words were recorded manually.
After the pretraining test, five sessions of
neurofeedback training were applied (Figure 2). Each
day only one session was applied, and the training
sessions lasted at most for 10 days according to the
availability of the participants. One session included
three subsessions and five trials constituted one
subsession, and thus one training session included
15 trials. Each trial lasted for 45 s, and 10 s were
placed between two subsequent trials. After five trials
(one subsession) the participants had enough time to
rest, approximately one to two minutes. After the
neurofeedback training sessions, a posttraining test
was given to the participants. This test also included
10 different English words with similar memorization
difficulty. The recall performances of the participants
were manually recorded.

NeuroRegulation

Neurofeedback Training
During the design stage, we recorded EEG signals
from an individual with closed and open eyes for a few
times, and then found the intersection of these two
cases. The data collected with open and closed eye
method made it possible to observe alpha band
synchronization and desynchronization, which can be
used to figure out alpha frequency band by using
band crossings (Nan et al., 2012). We found that
open and closed eyes spectra intersect at
approximately 7 Hz and 11.5 Hz, and we decided to
use this band for all participants in our experiments.
Relative band power (RBP) was used as the
neurofeedback parameter. RBP represents the ratio
between the absolute band power in 7–11.5 Hz range
and the absolute band power in 3.5–35 Hz range.
During the training, the participants were able to see
the panels shown in Figure 3. We oriented the
participants about the system and the feedback panel
before the sessions had started. The blue bar on the
left panel indicated the dynamically changing relative
alpha band power, and the red bars depicted the
mean value of the relative alpha band power
measured during the baseline recordings. The mean
power values were updated after each training
subsession.

Figure 3. User interface of neurofeedback training
sessions.

The participants tried to increase the blue bar’s level
to pass the red bars (baseline level), which worked as
a visual feedback. We also used an audio feedback
as a beep sound when the level was surpassed.
Some participants asked us to turn the sound off,
because they thought that it was distracting their
concentration. On that panel the red, blue, and green
lines showed some levels that the participant would
aim to pass as a challenge. They were utilized to

18 | www.neuroregulation.org

motivate the participants. On the right panel, the
dashed pink line showed relative alpha band power,
and the blue line indicated the absolute alpha band
power. We asked them to focus on the left panel only.
Before the training session started, several thinking
strategies were advised to the participants. For
example, the alpha power generally is related to the
relaxation process, and positive thinking such as
thinking about the family, friends and natural scenes
increase the alpha power (Nan et al., 2012). On the
first, second, and third sessions it was requested from
the participants to determine the best thinking
strategy that helped them to increase their alpha
power. However, on the fourth and fifth sessions, it
was requested not to find any new thinking strategies
but to focus on what they had figured out before to
increase the relative alpha band power as much as
they could. At the end of the subsessions, the
participants were able to see their performances as
shown in Figure 4.
Real-time EEG Processing
Before performing the real-time spectrum analysis of
the EEG signals obtained, several preprocessing
steps were applied. When we acquired the EEG
signals, we observed that there was a positive offset
around 4150 V, and we removed that offset by
subtracting 4150 from each value in the dataset. After
offset removal, the signal was fed into a fifth-degree
Butterworth high-pass filter whose cut-off frequency
was 3 Hz. Because we were only interested in the
alpha band power, we selected this cut-off in order
not to affect any spectral coefficients in that band.
When we did not perform the filtering excessive lowfrequency power dominated the spectral coefficients.
In the power spectrum computations Welch’s method
was used. This method first divides data into
windows (200 samples per iteration). Adjacent
windows have some overlap (50%) between each
other, and the method calculates the spectrum of
these windows. Finally, averaging is applied to
compute the spectrum of the data. The spectrum
coefficients were computed for every 0.25 Hz
(frequency resolution). During the training sessions,
before computing alpha band power values in realtime, sufficient number of samples had to be
collected. The first computed power spectrum was
seen on the screen once we acquired 700 samples.
During the spectrum computations, the last 512
samples were used (last 4 s). In addition, in real-time
computations, there was no artifact removal.

Results
Table 1 summarizes the results obtained during this
study indicating the average alpha band power
(ARABP) values during the baseline recordings and
each training session, pretraining and posttraining
memorization and recall durations and the number of
correct answers.
It is important to note that 6 out of 11 participants were
able to increase their ARABP values between 2.7%
and 11.75%, 3 participants slightly increased their
ARABP ~1%, and 2 of them slightly decreased their
ARABP values below approximately 1%. Taking all
participants into consideration, it was observed that
the ARABP increase was on average 4.4% as
depicted in Figure 5. Including only the successful
participants, who increased alpha band power over
1%, they were able to increase the ARABP 7.73% as
depicted in Figure 5.

19 | www.neuroregulation.org

Four participants who increased ARABP were also
able to increase the number of the correct recalls,
which they increased recall performances between 2
and 4 folds. One of the successful participants could
not increase or decrease the number of correct
recalls. One participant increased the ARABP (> 1%)
but decreased the number of correct recalls. Two
participants who were able to slightly increase
ARABP could increase the number of correct recalls
(5 to 7 folds). One participant who was able to slightly
increase alpha band power decreased the number of
correct recalls. Two participants decreased their
alpha band power but increased the number of
correct recalls (2 to 2.25 folds). When all participants
were considered, they were able to increase the
number of correct recalls 2.63 fold on average. All
subjects increased posttraining memorization
duration compared to the pretraining memorization
duration of 4.76 s per word.

Discussion
In this study we asked two related questions about
the relative alpha band power during the
neurofeedback training sessions and short-term
memory improvement. The first question was the
following: “Is it possible to increase the alpha band
power intentionally when compared to respect to
other bands (theta, beta, and gamma bands) of the

20 | www.neuroregulation.org

EEG spectrum?” According to our results, the answer
to this question may be positive. More than half of the
participants were able to increase their alpha band
power when compared to the other bands.
The second question we investigated was the
following: “Were participants, who increased relative
alpha band power, also able to improve short-term
memory performance?” In this study 8 out of 11
participants were able to increase the number of

Vol. 6(1):15–22 2019

Gökşin et al.

NeuroRegulation

words correctly remembered (correct recalls).
However, for the successful participants, only four of
them were able to increase the number of correct
recalls. Therefore, we were not able to give a positive
answer to this question. This did not mean that
neurofeedback training was not related to short-term
memory performance. These findings comply with
the results of the study undertaken by Lecomte and
Juhel (2011). In that study, a group of elderly
participants experienced four neurofeedback training
sessions, and the participants were requested to
memorize a list of words. They found that the
participants were able to increase alpha band power;
however, there were not any improvements in the
memory performance.
Feedback from the participants revealed that positive
thinking such as thinking of the family, friends,
beautiful scenes and so forth was effective in
increasing the alpha band power. However, not only
positive thinking increases alpha band power but also
some participants used negative motives such as
getting angry with someone or something in order to
improve the desired band power. This finding
complies with the study of Nan et al. (2012).
Another finding was that when some subjects focused
on one type of thinking style, this increased their
alpha band power first, but decreased later. In one
participant, the relative alpha band power firstly
increased, and then decreased after the third trial of
a subsession. This observation was generally true
especially after the third and fourth trials. This finding
might have arisen due to the exhaustion of the brain
while thinking about the same feeling or object for a
long time. Therefore, it may be useful for someone to
have a rest during the neurofeedback sessions by
changing the thinking style or the work, which they did
from one session to another. One neurological
explanation of this suggestion might be that the
activation of another neural network might help the
exhausted one rest.
A limitation of this study was the number of subjects
who participated in the neurofeedback sessions.
Inclusion of only 11 graduate students in the study
might have biased the interpretation of the results;
however, we think that this study is important in the
sense that for such a focused group the use of a
commercial, customized low-cost EEG device was
shown to be feasible. Another limitation was the
number of sessions and their durations. Although
there are studies reported in the literature which
included experiments with five sessions such as
Escolano, Aguilar, and Minguez (2011) and Zoefel,
21 | www.neuroregulation.org

Huster, and Herrmann (2011), the number of training
sessions and session durations might not be
sufficient for some participants to adapt with the
environment, and determine strategies to control their
brains in parallel with the aim of the study, which was
increasing the alpha band power. However, we
thought that if we increased the number of sessions
or durations the participants would get bored, and this
might affect the results negatively. In addition,
several subjects mentioned that they got bored of
viewing bar graphs in all training sessions. If we were
to use a game in the neurofeedback sessions, it
would have been more interesting and motivating for
the participants, and they might have been more
enthusiastic about the sessions.
In our future
endeavor we will increase the number of participants,
the neurofeedback training sessions and their
durations to investigate the phenomenon on the
children with learning difficulties.
In the neurofeedback literature, during the
experiments participants were requested to find their
way to synchronize with the feedback signals (visual
or auditory) by themselves. There was an “aha” point
which participants could understand and synchronize
with the screen or the sound (Collura, 2000).
However, in our study, due to the limited number of
sessions we advised some thinking strategies to the
participants before the neurofeedback training.
Participants indicated that they could not fully
synchronize with the blue bar during training, which
means they were not sure whether one type of
thinking style increased or decreased the alpha
power. However, at the end of the trial, they
mentioned that a particular thinking style was
generally useful in increasing the alpha power.
In the literature, this is the first study in which Turkish
students were trained via neurofeedback sessions in
order to improve their short-term memory
performances by using English words.
According to the findings reported by Klimesch in
1997, memory retrieval performance of subjects who
had high resting state peak of alpha frequency, which
is the frequency of maximum amplitude in alpha
band, was better than others. In a future study,
memory performance improvement may be examined
by increasing the peak alpha frequency with
increased number of participants and number of
sessions using motivating games.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the findings of this study are neither
sufficient to prove that neurofeedback training
improves the short-term memory performance, nor it
is irrelevant with the short-term memory performance.
However, we may mention that the neurofeedback
training is beneficial for the subjects to orient their
conscious minds to their goals.
