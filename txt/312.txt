Abstract
Recently, there has been a trend toward assistive mechatronic devices that are wearable. These devices provide the
ability to assist without tethering the user to a specific location. However, there are characteristics of these devices that
are limiting their ability to perform motion tasks and the adoption rate of these devices into clinical settings. The
objective of this research is to perform a review of the existing wearable assistive devices that are used to assist with
musculoskeletal and neurological disorders affecting the upper limb. A review of the existing literature was conducted
on devices that are wearable, assistive, and mechatronic, and that provide motion assistance to the upper limb. Five
areas were examined, including sensors, actuators, control techniques, computer systems, and intended applications.
Fifty-three devices were reviewed that either assist with musculoskeletal disorders or suppress tremor. The general
trends found in this review show a lack of requirements, device details, and standardization of reporting and evaluation.
Two areas to accelerate the evolution of these devices were identified, including the standardization of research, clinical,
and engineering details, and the promotion of multidisciplinary culture. Adoption of these devices into their intended
application domains relies on the continued efforts of the community.

Introduction
Technological research and increasing demands for
motion assistance are driving societies towards a
world in which this demand can be met through assistive mechatronic devices. According to the Global
Burden of Disease study in 2016, approximately
2.5 billion and 1.2 billion people suffer from neurological disorders (NDs) and musculoskeletal disorders
(MSDs), respectively.1 Many of these disorders will
require some form of rehabilitation, motion training,
or motion assistance for at least a portion of time after
the onset of the disorders. For other progressive disorders, the dependence on assistance with activities of
daily living (ADLs) will increase over time. Studies of
the economic burden of MSDs in many countries have
shown yearly costs of approximately $33.5 billion in
Canada,2 $231 billion in the USA,3 $1.3 billion in
Chile,4 and $15.6 billion in Sweden.5 These burdens

will continue to grow as the population grows and
the proportion of the population needing motion assistance increases. Meeting this demand with traditional
intervention strategies may become unfeasible as the
demand continues to grow at a faster pace than available resources.
The potential for assistive upper-limb devices to provide improved quality of life to humans has been

expanding the number of research endeavors in this
field over the last few decades. This increase in research
comes as the earlier devices have been shown to be
effective tools for assistance in clinical trials.6,7 The
number of devices entering this research community
has generated many reviews. In 2011, Gopura et al.
provide a brief examination of upper-limb exoskeletons, categorized by actuation type.8 Lo and Xie investigated existing upper-limb exoskeleton systems with a
summarization of the key challenges faced by these
systems in 2012.9 In 2014, Maciejasz et al. conducted
an extensive review of upper-limb devices, which features over 120 rehabilitation systems.10 This review
examined the combined contributions of portable and
non-portable devices and revealed the shift toward
wearable devices, although many of the systems are
non-portable. Furthermore, this study is missing a
detailed discussion of the sensing and computer systems, which are critical components of mechatronic
systems. The review presented here aims to complement the one conducted by Maciejasz et al. by focusing
on portable devices and including additional areas of
review.
Increasing the wearability and portability comes
from improvements, such as weight, volume and
power reduction, increasing accuracy, optimizing computational resources, and estimating uncertainties.
These improvements require further research efforts
in sensor, actuator, control, and computer systems.
The objective of this review is to explore the existing
research contributions in the area of wearable assistive
mechatronic devices for the upper limb. First, an overview of the state-of-the-art of these devices for the
upper limb will be presented. Next, a detailed analysis
of five key areas, sensing, actuation, control, computation, and applications, will provide evidence of successes and limitations of existing technologies and
methods. Finally, the challenges faced by this research
community will be discussed, and future directions
identified.

Review criteria and methods
Innovation of wearable assistive mechatronic devices is
out-pacing the standardization of terminology of the
research areas involved in their development. As a
result, terms, such as exoskeleton, robot, manipulator,
and mechatronic device are being used interchangeably
making it difficult to dissect these fields of engineering.
In order to eliminate this confusion, the following definitions of the criteria are proposed, in order to clarify
the review and the distinctions between devices. In this
review, devices are chosen based on their fulfillment of
the following four criteria: wearable, assistive, mechatronic, and for the upper limb. Wearable is identified as

Journal of Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies Engineering
the property that the base of a manipulator originates
from one or more attachment points on the human
body. This distinction is made to exclude exoskeletonor end-effector-based systems where the base of the
manipulator originates from attachment points in the
environment, such as the floor or wall, and, therefore,
limits the wearability of the system. Furthermore, this
definition includes devices that are intended to be wearable, but may not be fully portable due to limitations in
their components. Assistive implies that the device is
able to provide assistance to the user during completion of motion tasks. A distinction made in this review
is that assistance is viewed as the generation of forces to
either support a desired motion, such as during rehabilitative interventions, or to suppress an undesired
motion, such as in tremor suppression. A mechatronic
device encompasses systems that are comprised of
mechanical and electrical components, and has been
programmed to automatically complete complex
tasks, such as assisting with human motion. The four
major components of mechatronic system are the
mechanical, electrical and electronic, computer, and
control systems. Any devices or systems that fit these
criteria and are intended to assist with upper-limb
motion, including the thoracic spine, cervical spine,
shoulder, elbow, wrist, or hand, were candidates for
this review.
In this review, the sensing, actuation, control, and
computer systems of these devices will be examined to
identify the state-of-the-art and challenges facing their
future. Sensors and actuators are required to measure
and manipulate biological properties of the user.
Control systems are needed to ensure proper behavior
of the device. Communication and processing of biological, environmental, and device information is facilitated through computer systems. Although all of these
sub-systems may not be needed for the devices to be
classified as a mechatronic system, these sub-systems
have been identified as necessary to provide motion
assistance to humans. Since it may not be possible to
fully describe the details of all sub-systems in a single
manuscript, an article must contain at least brief
descriptions of three of the four sub-systems to be
included in this review. No specific inclusion criteria
were used to narrow the scope of the application
domains that are targeted by these devices.
The review was conducted by examining the IEEE
Xplore, Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library,
Scopus, Inspec, and Compex databases for relevant
articles. The databases were searched using various
combinations of the keywords: assistive, device, exoskeleton, mechatronic, portable, rehabilitation, robot,
tremor, and wearable. The initial search resulted in
90 articles that were considered based on keyword
matches, abstract content, and brief review of the

Desplenter et al.
article. The next step involved reviewing each article to
determine whether or not it met the review criteria. In
order to be included in this review, each study had to
include a device that met both the definition criteria
and the sub-system detail criteria discussed above.
Individual authors were assigned to review a portion
of the 90 articles. If an author could not determine
whether or not inclusion criteria had been met, all
authors would review the article and vote on its inclusion. This process resulted in a total of 64 articles that
were found to meet the criteria and be considered as
part of this review.

Commercially available devices
To date, only one device fits our review criteria and is
commercially available. The MyoPro is a wearable
assistive device developed for assistance for individuals
suffering from NDs, such as brachial plexus injury or
stroke.11,12 The most recent version of the MyoPro uses
electromyography (EMG) sensors to detect muscle
activity from both the elbow and forearm flexors and
extensors in order to assist with elbow flexion–extension and grasping. The sensing, actuation, control, and
computer systems are contained within the device
making it fully portable and wireless during operation.
Multiple clinical studies using the MyoPro to assist
with rehabilitation activities for individuals suffering
from stroke conclude that rehabilitation using this
device is as effective as traditional manual therapy
and improves performance during functional tasks
when worn.11,13–15 The successes of the MyoPro support further inquiry into these technologies and show a
promising future for wearable assistive devices.

State-of-the-art: Devices in the literature
The goal of this review is to answer the question: what
is the state-of-the-art in wearable assistive mechatronic
devices for the upper limb? Besides the MyoPro elbow
device, the state of the wearable assistive devices lies
within the research realm. A total of 53 wearable assistive mechatronic upper-limb devices have been identified from the literature. The majority of the articles
reviewed were motivated by disorders such as stroke,
Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, spinal cord
injury, arthritis, and post-surgical or post-traumatic
nerve damage. However, other disorders mentioned
in the literature include cerebral palsy, chronic carpel
tunnel syndrome, muscular atrophy, multiple sclerosis,
congenital disorders, and osteoarthritis. No wearable
assistive devices were found that meet the criteria and
assist with thoracic or cervical spine motion. Therefore,
these two body segments will not be discussed further.

The complexity of the technology and the human
body has caused an expansion of research into these
devices over the last decade. In fact, 54% of the articles
reviewed were published within the last five years. The
multidisciplinary nature of these devices coupled with
the immaturity of this field has led to diversity of the
technologies used. An overview of the major technologies used in these devices can be found in Table 1.
Devices in this table have been categorized by the
joints they actuate. Brief details about their supported
motions, sensed quantities, actuation systems, control
quantities, and application type are listed.
Overall, there are a few trends worth noting about
the state-of-the-art. First, the bulk of these devices are
wearable, but not fully portable. In many cases, either a
portion or all of the actuation system, power supply, or
communication and control cables tether these devices
to a location. Second, the majority of the devices in this
review focus on the motion of a single arm segment
(87% of devices) with opening and/or closing of the
hand and fingers being the largest focus (51% of devices). Improving the movement of even one segment in
the upper limb can translate into a better quality of life
for those suffering from the disorders. The singlesegment approach to the design of these devices has a
higher likelihood of finding solutions and, therefore,
getting to market and creating a social benefit. Lastly,
it should be noted that few clinical studies have been
performed on any of the reviewed devices. The devices
are still in development and require vigorous testing to
ensure human safety. Therefore, the research areas surrounding wearable assistive technologies have many
questions that still need to be answered.
The devices considered for this review have been
examined based on the topics of sensing, actuation,
control, computation, and applications. The major
technologies and techniques from each of these topics
are discussed in the following sections.

Sensing
Sensors are a major component within wearable assistive devices, as they are able to detect changes within
the device, the manner in which the user interacts with
it, or the environment. Sensing can be used to influence
the system’s behavior, allowing it to respond appropriately to user’s needs and fulfill the device’s purpose.
In 77% of the devices, biological signals were measured and used towards control of the system. These
devices can be further sorted into physiological signals,
which are electrically representative signals of internal
physiological processes of the human body, and biomechanical signals, which are signals measuring the outwards motion performed by the human body, such as
joint position and exerted force. The use of sensor

information collected from the actuation system to
provide system feedback was found in 36% of devices.
It is also common to use sensors external to the wearable device to collect data during the experimentation
process. However, this does not contribute to the realtime control of the device. Within this section, the sensing system will refer to the actual sensor itself and the
pre-processing required for the signal to be usable by
the control system, this includes additional circuitry
required for sensor functionality, filtering, amplification, and rectification of the signal. A visual depiction
of how the sensing modalities of the reviewed devices
are distributed is shown in Figure 1.
Physiological sensing. Within wearable assistive devices,
physiological signal-based sensing is often used to
detect signals indicative of a user’s motion or force
intention. For situations where the user desires to
move but is unable to do so, such as nerve or muscular
damage, sensing of physiological signals is crucial.
From the 23 devices reviewed that incorporate physiological sensing:
• 19 (82.6%) use EMG signals, which measure electrical activity of muscles,
• 3 (13%) use electroencephalogram (EEG) signals,
which measure electrical activity of the brain,
• and 1 (0.4%) uses EMG and muscle–force stiffness
signals, which measure the change in force of a
muscle as it contracts.26
The physiological signals collected are often of a
small amplitude, susceptible to noise, and can be challenging to classify. Still, 43% of the devices reviewed
have incorporated this type of sensor-based feedback.
EMG. EMG is the measurement of the electrical
potentials produced at the muscle.78 These myoelectric

Journal of Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies Engineering
signals are a result of the person’s intention to move. In
wearable applications, surface electromyography
(sEMG) is the method typically used to obtain data.
sEMG electrodes are placed onto the surface of the
skin and electrically coupled to the action potential
signals of the muscle, resulting in a voltage measurement of the muscle activity.
All of the devices employing sEMG to collect muscle
signals using gelled contact electrodes, abide by Surface
ElectroMyoGraphy for the Non-Invasive Assessment
of Muscles standards.79 This standard ensures electromechanical stability and reduces noise. The electrodes
are placed in a bipolar configuration, such that two
electrode sites are placed over each muscle of interest.
The two channels undergo differential amplification to
eliminate the common-mode signal, allowing the
changes in muscle activity to be more evident. Use of
hydrogel ensures that the electrode properly adheres to
the arm, preventing sensor movement and motion
artifacts.
In each of the studies, sEMG signals were recorded
from the muscles of interest, depending on the limb
segment assisted by the device. In the nine studies
where sEMG was used to control a hand
orthosis,42,46,49,53,57,58,65,66,70,71,75,76 five report the
muscles from which signals were collected. These
were: flexor digitorum superficialis,65 flexor policus
longus,65 flexor digitorum profundus,53,70,71,75,76 extensor digitorum communis,49,53,70,71,75,76 extensor digitorum superficialis,49 abductor pollicis brevis, biceps
brachii, and triceps brachii.70,71 The motion supported
by these devices was the flexion–extension of the fingers
and the thumb.
Eleven systems use sEMG for control of the elbow
joint.11,20,22–24,28,30,32,34,40 Nine of these systems were
concerned only with the flexion–extension motion of
the elbow and eight of these reported the muscles
from which signals were obtained. In accordance with

Figure 1. The distribution of sensing modalities across the reviewed devices. Electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography
(EEG), and EMG and muscle–force (EMGþMF) sensing are subcategories of physiological sensing, while biokinematic and force sensing
are subcategories of biomechanical sensing. In the case of biomechanical sensing, some devices used both biokinematic and force
sensing. The size of the bubbles in this figure is scaled to show the relative difference between the number of devices that used each of
the sensing modalities.

Desplenter et al.
the arm’s physiology, every system placed electrodes
over the biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles.
Additionally, two of the systems recorded from the
brachioradialis and one recorded from each the anconeus and flexor carpi ulnaris.20,32
Among the two systems that also supported the pronation–supination motion of the forearm, both
recorded from the biceps brachii, triceps brachii, brachioradialis, and flexor carpi ulnaris.20,40 One of these
devices looked at muscles from the extensor digitorum
and palmaris longus, which are not typically associated
with motion of the forearm or elbow.40 However, this
device analyses the flexion–extension and ulnar–radial
deviation of the wrist joint.
Due to the erratic nature of the sEMG signal, it
must undergo a relatively large amount of preprocessing compared to other signals before it can be
used as input to a control system. Among the devices
reviewed, 13 mention some pre-processing details.11,22–
24,28,32,34,40,49,53,57,58,65,70,71
Amplification noted in the
reviewed studies was as follows: Tang et al. used an
unspecified preamplifier,32 Stein et al. applied a gain
of 300,11 Tong et al. applied a gain of 800,70 and
Delph et al. used two gain stages, a 10 times gain
stage followed by a selectable gain stage.53 The filters
used ranged both in type and cutoff frequency, as
described among 11 devices.11,22,23,28,32,34,40,49,53,65,70,71
Fourth-order high and low pass filters were a popular
choice, used by four devices.28,32,34,53 Wang and Huang
used a band pass filter with a range of 100–1000 Hz,34
Delph et al. chose a high pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 10 Hz and a low pass filter with a cutoff
frequency of 750 Hz,53 and Kyrylova used a 10 Hz
high pass filter.28 Ando et al. chose a third-order
18 dB/octave high pass filter and an eighth-order elliptic filter with a cutoff frequency of 550 Hz.22 Other
filters used include Stein’s band pass filter with a
range of 10 Hz–3.12 kHz,11 Tong’s 10–500 Hz band
pass filter, Vaca Benitez’s et al. variance filter,23 Xiao
and Menon’s use of fourth-order autoregression,40 and
Mulas et al.’s moving average filter.65
Rectification of the EMG signal was reported by
Tang et al.,32 and signal shifting circuits were used by
Cao and Zhang and Delph et al. to shift the voltage
recorded into the range supported by the analog-todigital converters (ADCs).49,53 Tang, Vaca Benitez,
Xiao, In et al., Desplenter et al., and Kyrylova all calculated the root mean square (RMS) of the filtered
EMG data.23,24,28,32,40,57,58 The EMG sampling rate
among the devices reviewed ranged from 250 Hz57,58
to 8 kHz.34 Furthermore, the sensor systems surrounding EMG data collection for wearable assistive devices
varied greatly.

EEG. EEG is a measurement of the brain’s electrical
potentials from the scalp.80 These signals were used to
control three of the mechatronic systems reviewed. All
three publications report using the wireless EPOCþ
EEG headset (EMOTIV Inc., USA) to record signals
across the frontal and temporal lobes.21,29,54 The
system consists of 14 saline-based wet electrodes in
10–20 standard locations, and two reference electrodes
in the noise cancellation P3/P4 location attached to a
headset that wraps around the exterior of the cranium.
Fok et al. state that the EPOC device design did not
fully cover the motor cortex.54 The headset operates at
a 0.2–43 Hz bandwidth with built-in 50 and 60 Hz digital notch filters to avoid power line interference. A
digital fifth-order Sinc filter was also used to prepare
data for analysis using the proprietary Cognitiv Suite
software (EMOTIV Inc.). In these studies, the EEG
headset was used to control elbow flexion–extension,
forearm pronation–supination,21,29 wrist flexion–extension, radial–ulnar deviation,21 and finger flexion–extension.54 These studies indicate that the system was able
to provide clear and accurate sensor data capable of
controlling wearable assistive devices to support the
elbow, wrist, and hand.
The use of EEG allows a user with limited mobility,
or even with an amputation, with an accessible way to
provide biofeedback during physical rehabilitation.
However, the use of this system to determine motion
intention presents challenges. The spatial resolution of
the electrode with respect to the underlying neurons
makes it difficult to determine the exact location of
electrical activity. Therefore, significant amounts of
crosstalk occur among electrodes while obtaining
signal data, and only two simultaneous thoughts can
be classified.21 Another pitfall is the efficacy of tracking
intention. It is impossible for a researcher to evaluate
the efficacy of the system when the user’s intention
cannot be confirmed and may be considered hearsay.29
Xiao et al.21 and Looned et al.29 have reported the need
for user training sessions to teach subjects how to control the devices with their thoughts. In the future, EEG
signals can be improved through the use of additional
processing to eliminate artifacts, such as blinking.
Work can be done to decouple the EEG signals from
one another and from other biological signals recorded
from the body, either through digital classification
techniques or through hardware adjustments.
Muscle–force measurement. Only one of the
reviewed devices measured muscle–force stiffness as
biofeedback. Kim et al. demonstrated the efficacy of
this technique using piezoelectric resistive pressure sensors to control the flexion–extension movement of the
elbow joint. The sensors within this device were
attached to a band and positioned over the biceps

8
brachii, triceps brachii, flexor carpi ulnaris, and brachioradialis, which are consistent with reported
sEMG electrode locations for monitoring of this
gross motion. The study reports that the use of
muscle–force stiffness measurement was more accurately able to trigger a threshold-based actuation
system than EMG, was less susceptible to noise and
muscle fatigue, and did not require significant or
uncomfortable preparation. The work did not detail
the signal processing required or potential drawbacks
of this sensing method. Still, extensive validation of
muscle–force stiffness measurement does not yet
exist.26
Biomechanical sensing. Biomechanical sensing refers to
the outward mechanical motion that arises from
human body processes, such as the measurement of
the limb’s kinematic and dynamic properties. These
methods of sensing are easier to integrate within the
system than physiological sensing technologies, as
they are often compact, self-contained, less sensitive
to placement location, and less expensive.
Accordingly, 55% of the devices incorporate biomechanical sensing into their systems. Due to the reliance
of biomechanical sensing on the user being able to produce motion, limitations occur when the user suffers
from paresis or is unable to produce the desired biomechanical signal.
Biokinematic sensing. Biokinematic sensing refers to
the measurement and collection of kinematic data that
arises from human motion. Biokinematic-based sensing
was found within 86% of devices that use biomechanical sensing techniques. Information, such as joint
angle, linear and rotational position, velocity, and
acceleration, are used to provide biofeedback to devices
using position-based closed-loop control systems.
Many types of sensors can be incorporated under
the position sensing umbrella. Seven of the devices
opted to use potentiometers, which are capable of
tracking rotational or linear motion along the joint
or limb segment. Four devices measured data along
the elbow,16,25,32,40 five tracked the wrist or
hand,16,29,40,65,69 and one tracked the shoulder and
forearm.16 Potentiometers are frequently used in
mechatronic systems due to their low cost, lack of susceptibility to electromagnetic interference, and ease of
integration. No additional circuitry or power connections are required to provide an absolute position reading within a particular range.
Another sensing modality used for human-based
kinematic measurements is the encoder, which was
incorporated into six of the reviewed devices.17,23,34,39,62,72–74 Encoders are used to determine
elbow position in three devices,17,23,34 shoulder position

Journal of Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies Engineering
by Brackbill et al.,17 hand position by Iqbal et al.62 and
Xing et al.,72–74 and wrist position by Taheri.39 Some of
the sensors used required a signal conditioning circuit
and analog-to-digital conversion to provide absolute
angular measurement. Furthermore, some were
immune to degradation and environmental concerns,
including vibration, temperature, and contamination.
Xing et al. note the use of an unspecified filter and an
ADC,72 while the other studies did not detail the
remaining components of the sensing system.
Various types of bend sensors, made from conductive ink on a flexible laminate, were used by five devices
to determine joint angles and deflection. The devices
made by In et al. and Kang et al. used this modality
to generate data related to the wrist.57,58,63 The remaining three systems use bend sensors on the finger
joints.35,42,47 The full sensing system is described by
Aubin et al., who reported that the output of bend
sensors underwent voltage division, impedance buffering, and amplification with an adjustable 1–10 gain,
before the signals were digitized using a 10-bit
ADC.47 Filtering and analog-to-digital conversion
were not described in any of the other publications
involving bending-based position sensors. The fabrication of bend sensors is fairly robust, low cost, and
experiences little hysteresis or noise. However, these
sensors are susceptible to signal drift.
Another popular kinematic-based sensor is the inertial measurement unit (IMU), which consists of one or
more of the following components: accelerometers,
gyroscopes, and magnetometers. These types of sensors
may be combined in order to compensate for one
another’s shortcomings. For instance, gyroscopes experience significant drift, which can be compensated
by using the accelerometer and magnetometer. Seven
devices used some combination of the aforementioned
components. Of these devices, four used gyroscopes,19,25,29,41 five used accelerometers,16,19,28,37,41
one used magnetometers,41 and one used an unspecified
IMU.18 Six of the systems collect elbow
data,16,18,19,25,28,29 two collect shoulder data,16,18 one
collects wrist data,41 and two measure hand data
using IMUs.16,41 IMUs are generally inexpensive, compact and have a wide breadth of possible applications.
However, more computational complexity is required
than with other kinematic sensors to achieve information with efficacy. Within the devices reviewed, three
mention filtering the sensor output.19,25,28 Both
Herrnstadt and Menon, and Rocon et al. provide
filter specifications used for the gyroscopes in their
devices. They used a sixth-order elliptic high-pass
filter with a 2 Hz cutoff25 and a high-pass filter with a
cutoff of 0.3 Hz and a low-pass filter with a cutoff of
25 Hz,19 respectively. Meanwhile, Kyrylova reports filtering accelerometer signals with a second-order

Desplenter et al.
Butterworth high-pass filter with a 2 Hz cutoff
frequency.28
Force sensing. In addition to kinematic or position
sensing, force-based sensing is also frequently used in
wearable mechatronics for the upper limb. The relationship between joint force and torque makes measurement of interaction forces between the limb and
the device an attractive quantity to incorporate into a
closed-loop controller. While many of the studies mention the use of force sensing, nine incorporate human
driven
forces
into
a
closed-loop
controller.23,42,51,52,55,59–62,64,69,72–74 Five of these systems incorporate position-based biofeedback, as
well.23,42,62,69,72–74
Of these nine devices, one tracks elbow data and the
others track hand data. Vaca Benitez et al. track interaction between the elbow and the device, using a miniature inductive force sensor.23 The inductive force
sensor is compact, lightweight, resistant to shock and
vibration, short-circuit protected, and contains an
amplification system. However, this sensor is more
expensive than other force sensing technologies and
only one can be used without experiencing interference.23 The force induced by the arm on the device is
measured in order to calculate the amount of torque
required to control the system.
The other eight systems track forces exerted on the
orthosis by the hand.42,51,52,55,59–62,64,69,72–74 All of
these devices sense force through the change in resistive
behavior due to mechanical deformations of the sensor.
The two devices presented by Iqbal et al. used load cells
attached to strain gauges, which are inexpensive and
simple to manufacture but need protection from the
environment. Strain gauges require strict signal conditioning and are often arranged as a Wheatstone bridge.
Changes in resistance result in an imbalance and consequently a change in the voltage seen across the
bridge.59–62 Typically, this representative voltage is
then amplified and digitized within the sensor or electronic system. Sandoval-Gonzalez opted for flex-force
sensors connected to a force sensing circuit, which generates a frequency based on an op-amp’s perceived
capacitance and converts it to a representative
voltage.69
Three of the remaining devices used force sensing
resistors (FSRs).42,64,72–74 FSRs are all compact, flexible, inexpensive, and experience low noise and longterm stability. However, they tend to have a poorer
dynamic range and less accuracy than strain gauges.
FSRs are also typically nonlinear and exhibit significant hysterisis.81 The signal conditioning required is
voltage division and buffering, but these components
of the sensing system were not described in the
reviewed publications, aside from mention of

9
amplification by Matheson and Brooker.64 This forcesensing modality requires calibration before use.
Within seven of the hand-assistive devices that used
force-based sensors, the sensors were placed beneath
the mechanical structures of the device to determine
the interaction force exerted between the finger and
either the device or an external object. The eighth
used silicon piezoresistive sensors to measure palmar
interaction force.51,52
Actuator sensors. For some of the wearable assistive
devices, measurements of non-biological quantities
were used to provide feedback to the system.
Eighteen of these devices collected information from
the actuators to compare the performance against
the expected behavior.17,19,27,28,30,31,34,37,39,40,51,52,59–
62,64,66,67,72–76

When discussing non-biological feedback, the type
of sensing becomes dependent on principles of operation of each actuator. Designs incorporating motors
can rely on the same quantities as those measured
from the human body, such as position, speed, and
force within the actuated mechanisms. Ten of the devices that used feedback from the actuator used
kinematic-based sensing. Six of these report the use
of encoders placed on the motors allowing them to
determine the rotational position and speed at which
it operates.17,28,34,51,52,59–62 Six other systems opted to
track the linear position of the actuator.31,34,37,39,64,66
Three of these devices employed linear potentiometers
attached to springs and Bowden cables to measure
position.34,39,66 Kazi et al. and Matheson and
Brooker used a linear variable voltage transducer
(LVDT) for position sensing of piezoelectric and pneumatic artificial muscle (PAM) actuators.37,64 Matheson
and Brooker also reported amplification of the LVDT
output.64 Ren et al. converted the current running
through the motor into the speed of the motor through
a model of the actuator.31
The behavior of pneumatic actuators can be evaluated better through the measurement of pressure, as
they function through the conversion of compressed
air energy into mechanical motion. Six of the reviewed
devices used pressure sensing as feedback to the control
system. Five of the instances attached the sensor directly to a pneumatic actuator, with one reporting use of
silicone pressure sensors at the diaphragm,67 one measuring pressure in the control valve,72–74 one unspecified30 and two measuring the cylindrical chamber
pressure of the actuator.39,75,76 The final device uses
cable-tension sensors made from strain gauges.
Other dynamic actuator-based measurements are
used for feedback in three additional systems. Xing
et al. used force sensors to measure PAM forces in
the finger and thumb.72–74 This allows for increased

10
information and control of the actuator behavior, by
returning information from each joint. Like with biological quantities, strain gauges can be integrated into
the device. For instance, Rocon et al. used these sensors
to measure forces perpendicular to the motor shaft.19
While this information was later converted into torque
values, Xiao et al. directly measured the torque along
the axis of rotation coincident to the wrist flexion–
extension and ulnar–radial deviation movements.
KleinJan measured resistance within shape memory
alloy wire actuators as an input to the control
system.27 All systems using non-pressure-based dynamic measurements, included in this review, focus on the
hand or wrist.
Of these 18 devices, 3 use the measured actuator
data as the only control input.27,31,67 Conversely, 2 of
the remaining devices use physiological quantities30,75,76 and 10 use biomechanical properties as
other inputs.17,19,28,37,39,51,52,59–62,64,72,73 There are
three devices that use both physiological, biomechanical, and on-actuator sensors.34,40,66 The related sensing
systems of the on-actuator sensors are not often
described. As a result, information is limited with
regards to filtering, amplification, rectification, data
conversion, and other pre-processing techniques.
Overall comments and future directions. Through the
review of existing devices, it is clear that a myriad of
sensing modalities and quantities are incorporated into
wearable assistive devices. Data are collected from both
biological processes, such as physiological signals or
mechanical motion of the limb, from the actuator, or
both. However, many devices do not use sensor signals
to dictate the behavior of the control and actuation
systems. Sensor-based feedback was not used by
13% of the reviewed devices and appears to rely
on predetermined motion paths or open-loop
control.36,43,48,50,56,68,77 This may limit the precision
of these systems and make them less responsive to the
immediate needs of the user.
Multi-modal sensing seems prevalent within wearable assistive devices, based on the devices reviewed.
Through the use of multiple sensing modalities, a
fuller profile of the user’s motion or intention can be
provided. This allows accuracy and fatigue to be further characterized, and to track muscle health or range
of motion over time. The sensors placed on the actuators provide insight into the functional output of the
controller and the sensors measuring biological quantities are able to incorporate data related to the actual
condition of the user. Realizing the potential benefits of
multi-modal sensing, eight researchers have expressed
the desire to incorporate additional sensing modalities
into their future work.16,32,36,49,55,57,58,64,75,76 Three of
those eight researchers specifically noted their interest

Journal of Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies Engineering
in exploring the use of EMG signals in future
work36,55,64 and two expressed the desire to add more
EMG electrode sites.24,65 These researchers may be
seeking more information to input to the controller.
However, it is uncertain whether additional sensors
will improve the system performance until they are
implemented.

Actuation
The actuation system used for wearable assistive devices is one of the vital components of the device as it
provides the motion and torque/force to assist the user.
An actuation system consists of the actuator and a
method for transmitting the force to the required
joints. The transmission method allows the actuator
to be mounted remotely instead of attached directly
to the joint and also change the direction of motion.
For wearable devices, two main requirements related to
the actuation are the force or torque required to complete the motion task and the range of motion of the
joints involved in the motion task. Actuators are available that can fulfill or exceed these requirements, but
often fail to meet size and weight constraints that
enable portability. Therefore, a major objective is to
reduce the weight of the device, which is partially
done through minimizing the size of the actuation
system, while meeting the motion requirements.
Based on the difficulty of meeting actuation requirements, a wide variety of different actuation systems
have been proposed in the reviewed devices. The
types of actuators found in these devices are direct current (DC) motors, pneumatic actuators, hydraulic
actuators, electromagnetic friction brakes, magnetorheological fluid-based actuators, shape memory alloy
actuators, twisted coiled actuators (TCAs), and piezoelectric actuators. The frequency of use of each of these
actuation systems categorized by the targeted limb segment is shown in Figure 2. DC motors are the most
commonly used actuator (62% of devices), followed by
pneumatic actuators (21% of devices). The remaining
types of actuators are only used once or twice. The
popularity of DC motors is likely due to being easier
to implement than other actuators, while also being
capable of providing the required actuation.
However, DC motors are not a perfect or global solution and this has led to implementing less commonly
used actuators.
Actuator designs for the hand focus on gripping
force as a requirement instead of torque requirements
for each of the hand and finger segments. In et al.58
suggest that a pinch force of 20 N and a wrap grasp
force of 40 N would be sufficient to execute some
ADLs. Of the devices that actuate the shoulder,
elbow, and wrist joints, 41% listed the torque applied

Desplenter et al.

Figure 3. Average and range of torques of the reviewed devices compared to average torque values for activities of daily living (ADL)
across different joints. The torque values of ADLs are taken from a study by Rosen et al.82

to the joint.16,21,23–25,28–31,36,40 Figure 3 shows the average torque and range of torques for each joint contrasted to the torque values for healthy human joints
performing ADLs. In device designs that list torque
specifications, the joint torque of these devices are
able to meet the torque demands for ADLs as gathered
from the study performed by Rosen et al.82
DC motors. In this review, 62% of devices use a DC
motor for actuation. Most notably, DC motors have
been used to actuate each of the upper–limb segments
in this review. The large selection of commercially
available DC motors is what makes this type of actuator so popular. In general, implementation of these
actuators is much easier compared to most other
types of actuators. Of the devices employing DC
motors, 42% used brushed DC motors,11,34,40,43,49–

54,59,60,62,63

24%
used
brushless
DC
motors,17,19,23,24,28,31,41,58 6% used both brush and
brushless DC motors,21,29 and 28% do not specify the
type of DC motor that is used. Rotational motion is
provided by 82%11,17–19,21–24,28,29,31,33,34,40,43,47,49–53,58–
60,62,63,65,69
of these DC motors and the remaining 18%
provide linear motion.36,46,54,55,66,70 The rotational DC
motors all require a gearhead to increase the torque
output, which is transmitted to the required joint
through either cables, Bowden cables, gears, or linkages. The linear motion DC motors are all connected
to the actuated joint using linkages.
For wearable assistive devices, brushless DC motors
are generally a better choice over brushed DC motors.
The brushed DC motors have well behaved speed–
torque characteristics are adaptable, and are easy to
control, which can make them a great option for

12
prototyping and sub-system evaluations.83 However,
brushless DC motors have reduced maintenance,
higher output power, better heat dissipation, and the
ability to maintain or increase torque at different
speeds.84 The downside to brushless DC motors is
that they are more expensive than brushed DC
motors and the control is more complex.
Pneumatic actuators. Pneumatic actuators were the
second most commonly used actuator in the reviewed
devices. Compared to DC motors, pneumatic actuators
offer a higher power-to-weight ratio, excluding the
actuator infrastructure, and compliant actuation. Of
the 12 devices using pneumatic actuators, nine used
PAMs,16,20,26,32,35,42,48,64,72 2 used pneumatic bending
actuators,75–77 and 1 used a pneumatic cylinder
actuator.39
PAM actuators consist of an inflatable bladder
inside a braided mesh that is clamped on both ends.
When the bladder is inflated, it results in a contraction
of the PAM due to the constraints of the structure. In
the listed devices, these actuators are placed along the
forearm or upper-arm, such that a pulling force is
applied to actuate a joint. Some devices used PAMs
to actuate the joint in one direction,16,42,48,72 while
others use an antagonistic setup to actuate in opposing
directions.20,26,32,35,64 The main advantages for PAMs
in a wearable device is that they are generally lighter
than other actuators and are mechanically compliant.
In addition, PAMs do not require a fixed joint center,
allowing more variation in the design of devices that
employ them. The disadvantages to PAMs are that
they have a slow and nonlinear dynamic response,
which makes them challenging to control.10,85
Yap et al. and Yun et al. have used pneumatic bending actuators to provide assistance for hand
motion.75–77 In these two devices, the actuators are
attached along the fingers using either Velcro with a
glove or straps, respectively. When the actuator is
inflated, it causes a bending force. This actuator only
provides a bending force in one direction, which means
that it can only assist with flexing the finger, but not
extending it. The advantage of this type of actuator is
that it is placed directly on the finger joints, so no
additional parts are needed for transmission of forces.
The pneumatic cylinder actuator incorporated by
Taheri can generate a push or pull force that is used
for tremor suppression.39 The ability to provide force
in both directions is an advantage that this type of
actuator has over the PAM and pneumatic bending
actuators, which can only provide force in one
direction.
Hydraulic actuators. Hydraulic actuators operate similarly to pneumatic actuators, but use a liquid for power

Journal of Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies Engineering
transmission, instead of compressed air. In this review,
hydraulic actuators were implemented in two of the
devices. Polygerinos et al. use a custom made flexible
fluidic actuator for assistive hand rehabilitation,67
while Pylatiuk et al. developed a custom made hydraulic bending actuator for assistive elbow rehabilitation.30
The advantages of hydraulic actuators are higher
power density and higher efficiency than pneumatic
actuators. However, hydraulic actuators have the
potential to leak liquid and require more infrastructure
to function, such as a pump and reservoir. This creates
challenges to find biocompatible fluids that meet functional requirements and infrastructure that will not
restrict the portability of the system.
Electromagnetic friction brake. The electromechanical friction brake uses an electromagnetic force to apply a
frictional force on the rotating disk, which will slow
or stop motion. Herrnstadt and Menon use an electromagnetic friction brake for a tremor suppression
device.25 This device operates by switching between
applying no torque and a resistive torque, whose
values were not specified. The electromagnetic friction
brake is only useful for applications where a motion
produced by the user needs to be resisted, such as
tremor suppression. A big limitation to these brakes
is that the best performance occurs in a range that is
near the maximum output torque. The output torque is
generally unstable when it is not in this upper end of
the torque range. Therefore, application of this actuator relies on the condition that the required suppression
torque varies less than the stable range of output
torque.
Magnetorheological fluid actuators. Only one device in
this review used a magnetorheological fluid actuator
to provide tremor suppression of the wrist.38
Magnetorheological fluid actuators use a magnetic
field to vary the viscosity of the magnetorheological
fluid. By altering the viscosity of the fluid, the actuator
can be used to slow or stop movement of a joint. As
with electromagnetic friction brakes, this type of actuator can only be used to resist forces. As a result, magnetorheological fluid actuators are best suited for
suppression of undesired motion. The advantage of
this type of actuator is that it has a fast response to
control inputs. However, the large weight of these
actuators limits the wearability of devices employing
them and the actuators themselves have an impact on
voluntary motion.
Shape memory alloy actuators. Shape memory alloy actuators were implemented by two of the reviewed devices.27,56 Both of these devices incorporated shape
memory alloy cables to drive joint motion. Shape

Desplenter et al.
memory alloy cables undergo a phase transformation
from a flexible state (Martensite) to a rigid state
(Austenite). They can be trained to remember a desired
shape upon heating. The advantages of this type of
actuator are that it has a silent actuation and a
simple structure. However, shape memory alloy
cables exhibit nonlinear characteristics, low energy efficiency, and a slow response to control inputs. The low
energy efficiency is due to the cables being heated
through Joule heating, while the slow response is
caused by differing heating and cooling rates.
Reducing cooling time of the cables would likely
require increasing the weight and the cost of the
device. Further research is required to improve these
actuators and capitalize on their benefits.
Twisted coiled actuators. TCAs are a more recent technology to be used in wearable assistive devices. Saharan
et al. uses TCAs in a hand orthosis in order to assist
finger motion.68 TCAs consist of a fiber that has been
twisted and coiled, while under tension. When heat is
applied to the fibers, TCAs can contract by up to 49%
of their initial length.86 Additionally, the energy density
has been recorded as high as 5.3 kW/kg,87 which is significantly higher than human muscle (200 W/kg).88
However, similar to the shape memory alloy cables,
the downside to this type of actuator is the low
energy efficiency, due to the inherent energy losses of
a thermal actuator. Furthermore, TCAs require much
higher temperatures, than human tissue can withstand,
to function. For example, Saharan’s design used temperatures up to 250 C. Therefore, thermal protection is
required in order to deploy this actuation technology in
wearable applications.
Piezoelectric bimorph actuators. Piezoelectric bimorph
actuators were implemented in one of the wearable
assistive devices. Kazi et al. use a piezoelectric bimorph
actuator to suppress tremors occurring in the wrist
joint.37 This actuator consists of two piezo plates
bonded together with opposite polarity, such that one
expands, while the other contracts, causing it to bend.
Using piezoelectric bimorph actuators provides developers with a fast response and low power actuation.
However, the small range of motion produced by
these actuators limits the opportunity for their application. Kazi’s device did not describe any specifications
of the actuator, making it difficult to compare against
other types of actuators.
Actuator placement and transmission. The placement of
actuators falls into one of the following three categories: on the device joint, near the joint, and away from
the joint. Some of the lighter actuators, such as the
piezoelectric bimorph actuator and the hydraulic

13
bending actuator, are capable of being directly
attached to the joint.30,37 Being placed on the joint
removes the need for additional transmission and
helps achieve a lower overall system weight. Many of
the reviewed devices place the actuator near the joint of
interest. However, this design decision requires a transmission structure in order to actuate the joint. The
transmission types for actuators placed near the joint
include gears,19,22–25,28,31,69 cables,47,64,65,68,72 linkages,54,70 or a combination of these transmission methods.21,33,34,40,43,48–50,52,53,55,57,59,62,63 The downside to
having actuators near the joint is the required transmission will increase the size and weight of the device.
Furthermore, transmission systems, typically, are not
100% efficient creating power losses between mechanisms. A few of the reviewed devices place the actuator
away from the actuated joint, either on the back of or
supported separately from the user. In this review,
devices with actuators placed on the back use either
cables with pulleys17,18 or Bowden cables11,53,66 for
transmission of force, whereas the devices with the
actuators placed away from the body use Bowden
cables.47,49,63 The advantage of placing the actuators
on the back is that it is easier to support the weight
on the torso instead of the arm. Devices with the actuators away from the user are easier for the user to support, but they can limit the mobility of the user.
A breakdown of the actuator type, based on placement,
is shown in Figure 4.
Overall comments and future directions. Actuation systems
are critical components of wearable assistive devices,
for without them no physical assistance can be generated. After examining the actuators, it is clear that the
application plays an important role in actuator choice.
DC motors and pneumatic actuators are the most
common across the reviewed devices. However, seven
other types of actuators have been proposed. The variety of actuation systems suggests that no one type of
actuator can provide a global solution for wearable
assistive devices.
Two of the main challenges with the reported devices are the size and weight of the actuators, and the
lack of actuator requirements and specifications. First,
minimizing the size and weight of the devices can be
partly achieved by reducing the size or weight of the
actuation system. Two potential avenues for reducing
these aspects include continuing to improve existing
actuators and consider new ways to implement the
actuators. Currently, most devices use DC motors
due to their reliability and ease of implementation,
but they are bulky and heavy. Other emerging types
of actuators may reduce the size of devices, but are
not as reliable or easy to control. As a result, both
types of actuators can benefit from continued

14

Figure 4. Frequency of devices and actuator types for each actuator location.

improvements. The other avenue is to develop new
ways to implement the actuators. This includes finding
ways to reduce the number of actuators used or positioning the actuators such that the weight is less of a
burden on the user. Second, most of the reviewed devices do not provide all of the necessary information for
developers to make an informed decision about their
usage. Without that information, it can be difficult to
evaluate the actuation and find ways to improve upon
it. Ideally, researchers would provide the force or
torque range, range of motion, speed, and weight of
the actuation system, as well as actuation requirements
for the intended application. This is especially important as it can increase the opportunities to study new
actuation technologies.

Control
The control system of a wearable assistive device manages the behavior of the actuator using a control pathway with or without the help of sensory input. The
input, output, feedback state, and strategy (internal
model) are important aspects of these control systems
and can be used to categorize them.89 It was found that
control systems were developed to use physiological
signals (such as EMG), biomechanical signals (such
as joint position), or a combination of these two
types of signals as inputs. Systems incorporated both
closed-loop and open-loop feedback strategies to regulate position, velocity, acceleration, force, or torque

outputs. Finally, their internal models included proportional–integral–derivative (PID) control, threshold
control, sliding-mode control, machine learning control, biomechanical model control, empirical model
control, and other control methods.
In this section, the review of the control system of
the wearable assistive devices is presented from the perspective of their internal models. A generalized control
system model is presented in Figure 5. Due to insufficient information provided in some of the reviewed
manuscripts, the control systems of 19% of the devices
were unavailable to be included in this section.
PID control. PID controllers and their variants have
been the mainstay of the control system of wearable
assistive devices. A PID-based controller operates
based on the error between the measured signal and
the desired signal, hence it does not require a complex
mathematical realization of the plant. Its advantages in
computational load, control accuracy, simplicity, and
robustness have facilitated the development of wearable assistive devices in recent years.
Pylatiuk et al.,30 Mulas et al.,65 Desplenter et al.,24
Aubin et al.,47 and Cao and Zhang49 adopted closedloop proportional control in their wearable exoskeleton
devices. These control systems manage the speed of the
actuation systems to be proportional to the measured
EMG intensity. This strategy provides more controllability to the user than the threshold control system.
Although these devices do not estimate the user’s

Desplenter et al.

Figure 5. A generalized control system block diagram for wearable assistive devices. In this example, estimation controllers are
typically developed as threshold, sliding-mode, machine learning, biomechanical model, or empirical model controllers, while actuation
controllers are commonly PID-based controllers. The control system architecture and details of each block will vary based on the
needs of the specific device or application.

intended motion, the reduced complexity of these controllers makes them more suitable for implementation
with lower-cost embedded computer systems.
Brackbill et al.,17 Lessard et al.,18 Ren et al,31
Andrikopoulos et al.,35 Chiri et al.,52 and Wu et al.74
adopted closed-loop PID control in their wearable exoskeleton devices. The control accuracy of these devices
is reduced largely in the presence of low frequency disturbances, which is a non-negligible issue in wearable
assistive devices. The jitters from the controller output
may also reduce overall control accuracy by introducing unwanted interactions from other inputs as disturbances. Furthermore, these control strategies require
improvement in adaptability for applications with different users and scenarios, such as incorporating physiological signal-based control, or adaptive control.
Lastly, Wu et al. developed a self-tuning fuzzy PID
for a wearable rehabilitation device. The parameters of
the PID controller can be tuned adaptively according
to the error. Such control systems not only maintain
the advantages of the conventional PID controller, but
can achieve higher control performance and accuracy.
Threshold control. Several of the articles reviewed implemented a type of control called threshold control. This
category of control applies to EMG-based wearable
exoskeleton devices, which required the determination
of a percentage threshold with respect to the user’s
maximum voluntary contraction. A typical maximum
voluntary contraction test is required to calibrate the
system. The devices are activated when the detected
EMG signal exceeds the threshold and actuated at a
predefined speed. Tong et al.,70,71 Yap et al.,76 and
Delph et al.53 chose 20% to 30% of the maximum voluntary contraction as the threshold.
Xiao et al. developed a closed-loop threshold-controlled brain–computer interface (BCI) for stroke rehabilitation.21 This system is designed to identify one
conscious motion command at a time to activate the
different movements of the device. For each conscious
motion command, a sequential control scheme was predefined by the researchers. The commands consist of

three stages, which are pre-decision, decision, and postdecision. A threshold was predefined for each stage to
compare with the magnitude of the user’s EEG signal,
in order to determine the intention of the user.21 If the
average activation power is beyond the threshold, then
the device is actuated. This control scheme was tested
on one healthy volunteer. Although the results showed
good performance when distinguishing between a conscious thought and the neutral state, the fact that they
have only tested on a single subject is a considerable
limitation. More subjects are required to validate the
proposed control system. In addition, this system
requires a long time-window to distinguish a valid conscious command, which is a drawback for real-time
control, since it may cause undesired actuation of the
user’s joint.
Similarly, Fok et al. adopted the closed-loop threshold control in a wearable assistive device for stroke
rehabilitation.54 Instead of using a sequential control
scheme, this system developed a least mean square
adaptive filter to match its gain to the change of the
input signal. Although the accuracy still requires further improvement, the author claimed that the realtime performance and the accuracy of the system
exceeded previous studies and that this device holds
the possibility for in-home treatment.
Sliding-mode control. Another type of control system is
called the sliding-mode controller (SMC). Polygerinos
et al. developed a rehabilitation glove using an SMC.67
This control system is constructed by one piecewise
function that describes the general form of the device.
Although such a controller does not require an explicit
model of the system, it requires the system’s behavior
to be continuous and smooth, which is not the general
case in human–machine interactions. Furthermore, this
control strategy requires the actuators to cope with
high frequency control actions, which could affect the
product life of the system for patient use.
Machine learning control. The aforementioned control
systems are undoubtedly simple control strategies to

16
use for a wearable assistive device. However, this simplicity limits the ability for the user to control the
device, since the controlled parameters, such as speed
and force, are not adaptive. To improve the user controllability, artificial intelligence has been implemented
to estimate the user’s voluntary motion.32,40 For example, Tang et al. adopted a closed-loop back-propagation neural network to estimate the target joint angle.32
An EMG-to-angle model was built for pattern recognition in the back-propagation neural network, and the
RMS of the EMG was used as the input to the classifier. The evaluation of the control scheme showed that
the proposed system provides an effective way to estimate the user’s motion in real time, but the estimation
error varies with different motions. Moreover, every
subject has to go through a procedure to train the
system to recognize their input signals.
A more complex closed-loop neural network-based
control system and a support vector machine-based
control system were developed and compared by
Xiao and Menon.40 To increase the accuracy of the
classifiers, six features were calculated from the raw
EMG data: the RMS value, four coefficients of a
fourth-order auto-regression model, and the wavelength. The extraction of these features created a time
delay of 0.124 s. The evaluation of the two classifiers
showed that support vector machines had better performance than feed forward neural network, and could
identify the levels and directions of the user’s wrist
torque better. The authors mainly studied the application of artificial intelligence in estimating the torque of
the user’s joint. However, it is not sufficient to apply
such technique in an assistive device without motion
estimation. To develop a fully functional assistive
device, additional research on motion estimation is
needed.
In addition to the artificial neural network, a closedloop linear classifier method was used to transform
EEG signals to an appropriate control command.29
In the field of machine learning, a linear classifier identifies an object’s characteristics by forming a classification decision using a linear combination of features.
This technique works well for systems with multiple
features (variables). Although accuracy is lower for
linear classifiers compared to nonlinear classifiers, the
computational speed of the former is much higher for
training and testing. Looned et al. adopted this technique to identify five motion patterns: elbow extension,
elbow flexion, wrist pronation, wrist supination, and
hand open.29 The system achieved an average classification accuracy of 98% from five volunteers during
single task evaluation.
One limitation of machine learning controllers is the
amount of data that are required to train the models. In
order to derive an optimized model, many subjects and

Journal of Rehabilitation and Assistive Technologies Engineering
data sets are needed. Tang et al. required 48 data sets to
train their model for each of the 2-s, 4-s, and 8-s duration elbow motions. Each data set consisted of four
EMG channels and one elbow angle channel of data,
which were sampled at 1024 Hz. As a result, the training data consists of over 3.4 million data points that are
needed to train the model. Even given this volume of
training data, the neural networks still only achieved an

average RMS error of 10:9 during control of their
device. Neither Xiao et al. nor Looned et al. discussed
how much data was used to train their models. This
highlights the need for developers to both examine the
accuracy–computational demand trade-off and provide
these details within their research articles.
Biomechanical model control. Although non-physiological
model-based control systems have better system
response performance compared to other control strategies, their control accuracy is limited. To improve the
performance of wearable assistive devices, Iqbal
et al.,59,60 and Taheri et al.90 incorporated the dynamic
model of human joints into their control systems.
Although the control accuracy of such devices largely
depends on the complexity of the model, the potential
of these control methods has been recognized by the
research community, and may likely become one of the
common options for the control system design of wearable assistive devices. Since joint dynamics are the
direct result of muscle activation and other biological
phenomena together, such as joint friction, to control a
wearable exoskeleton device, Ueda et al. investigated
applying simplified muscle models together with a joint
dynamic model using EMG input. This study proposed
an individual muscle force control algorithm that aims
to obtain a wider variety of muscle activity data.20 This
algorithm estimates the amount and direction of the
force of the subject’s hand by modeling nine joints
from the torso to the wrist. Although the simulation
and experimental validations have shown the validity
of the proposed concept, future work is required to
improve the control accuracy, to validate the efficacy,
and to validate the system with dynamic tasks.
Empirical model control. A robust mechatronic system
often uses a feedback control strategy. However, this
does not necessarily mean that control systems without
sensory feedback are obsolete in wearable assistive
devices. The open-loop empirical process control uses
a predefined model to associate the input signal to the
output signal with no feedback. The application of
such control systems is often for the purpose of initial
testing, monitoring, evaluation, or low-end control.
Sugar et al.,16 Kazi et al.,37 Higuma et al.,36 Kang
et al.,63 Yun et al.,77 Allotta et al.,43,44 and Conti
et al.45 adopted open-loop empirical process control

Desplenter et al.
in their studies. These are undoubtedly simple control
strategies to use for a wearable assistive device.
However, the lack of sensory feedback results in
lower accuracy and reliability in general, compared to
their closed-loop counterparts. Although such control
methods are easy to implement and have a low relative
cost, the increasing demand on smart technology forces
research on wearable assistive devices to adopt smart
feedback control strategies.
Other control strategies. In addition to the aforementioned control systems, Vaca Benitez et al. implemented a multi-input, single output model structure
in a wearable elbow rehabilitation brace.23 This
model is based on system identification with a recursive
least square (RLS) algorithm, which utilizes EMG,
position and force signals from the user. The proposed
system showed good performance in matching the
user’s real signals. However, the RLS algorithm reacted
sensitively to the noise in the signals, especially the
EMG signal. This is due to surface EMG signals containing a large portion of noise and muscle crosstalk.
Although the proposed system presented promising
results, it is crucial to improve the robustness of the
algorithm to the noise residing in the sampled signals.
Kyrylova proposed a simplified neural activation
model that estimates the muscle activities from two
antagonistic muscle groups.28 This model was integrated in a Kalman filter to generate the control signal for a
wearable assistive device using EMG and joint position
signals. With the help of the Kalman filter, the difference of neural activation from the two muscle groups
can be mapped directly to the user’s motion history,
which allows the speed profile to be estimated one
step ahead. The experimental validation with prerecorded data showed very promising results, in terms
of the overall control accuracy of the system. To validate the efficacy of the device, on-patient assessment is
required in the future.
Thanks to the rapid growth of the computational
capability of microcontrollers, the application of
model-based control strategies in wearable assistive
devices has increased considerably. Rocon et al. developed a three degree-of-freedom wearable orthosis for
tremor suppression using a model-based controller,
called the weighted-frequency Fourier linear combiner
(WFLC).19 Instead of modeling the musculoskeletal
relations of the target joints and muscles, the WFLC
adapts both the frequency and amplitude parameters of
the Fourier series to the input signal. This method
improved the response performance of the wearable
assistive device, and the implementation of frequency
estimation greatly improves the performance of the
controller. However, the use of this pure sinusoidal
model is insufficient to represent a real input signal.

Overall comments and future directions. Control systems
function as the decision maker of wearable assistive
devices, and play an important role in processing the
measured signal from the sensing system and in regulating the actuation system. Control strategies, such as
threshold control, PID control, linear classifiers,
among others, are commonly implemented in wearable
assistive devices. These control strategies do not require
the embedded system to have high computational
power, leaving the embedded system with enough processing time to perform other important tasks. This is an
advantage that is especially important for devices that
use physiological signals, such as EMG signals, since
they often require multiple channels of data that are
sampled at higher frequencies than those of voluntary
motion. Since data sampling and processing occupy a
large portion of the computational resources, the control accuracy of such devices may be limited.
The use of artificial intelligence-based and modelbased control methods may result in better control
accuracy than simpler control systems based on threshold or PID control, especially the ones that use
physiological-based signals. To address the issue of
high computational load of using these more advanced
control systems, cloud computing could be a potential
online solution, which is limited by the data transfer
rates of the network. With the ultimate goal being realtime control of the device, the computational demands
of the control system and limited computational
resources available to these devices pose a major
challenge.

Computation
Modern digital computer systems are the foundation
for implementing a variety of aspects of sensing, actuation, and control of wearable assistive mechatronic
devices. The complexity of these devices creates a
large demand for processing, analysis, and storage of
information, which is being supplied by computer systems and electronic components. Although, the
computer systems facilitate the interaction of all of
the mechatronic system components, some authors
have neglected to include important details relating
to the computer systems used in the design,
development, and testing of their devices. From
the review, no description of the computer
architectures or systems was given for 21% of the
devices.20,27,33,37,38,42,48,50,55,62,64 Of the devices that
provided computer system information, the general
computer hardware and software specifications have
been extracted, as follows.
Computer hardware. Computer system hardware is
described in 79% of the reviewed devices, although

18
very briefly by some. The descriptions range from as
vague as “a standard data acquisition board” to listing
hardware components, their connections, and their
communication protocols. General purpose computer
systems, such as a laptop or personal computer, were
listed as an integral component of the computer architecture
in
32%
of
the
devices,16,17,21,24–
26,28,29,34,35,40,41,52,54,59,60,65,66,68,72,73
while 34% of devices listed the use of off-the-shelf microcontroller
boards.11,36,41–43,47,49,53,56,63,65–67,70,72,76,77
Where
model numbers are listed, basic processor information
can be looked up, but only 11% of the devices listed
basic processor and memory information.18,22,28,29,35,65
To complement these computer systems, 26% of the
devices are using other off-the-shelf electronics,
such as data acquisition boards and sensing
In
platforms.17,19,24,26,28,34,35,39,40,52,57,59–61,68,72–74
order to increase the portability of these devices, the
computer systems must be embedded within the devices
or stored on the user’s body. This means that computer
hardware analysis is important to ensure that the computational requirements can be factored in when
designing these devices. A breakdown of the type of
computer hardware systems is presented in Figure 6.
Computer software. In terms of computer system software, a similar trend can be seen towards researchers
using off-the-shelf software systems. The review
reveals that 51% of the studies reported the use of
off-the-shelf software with MATLAB (25% of the
including
the
devices),16,19,23,26–28,32,41,46,48,52,55,65

XVR.69 Although authors are listing their software systems, only 8% of the devices describe the operating
system in which these software systems are executed.22,28,35,41 The type of operating system that is used
can have major effects on the execution of the control
software and, therefore, should be reported.
Programming languages, namely C and Cþþ, were
used in 9% of the devices as a primary development
tool for software.11,19,24,28,65 Very few descriptions of
information regarding the software structure, complexity or timing can be found in the literature. Some of the
software structure can be inferred from the control
system descriptions, but it may not be possible to
derive the entire software architecture from the control
architecture, as they may not be mapped one-to-one.
Overall comments and future directions. One of the successes seen with the computer systems is in the required
power supplies. Both lithium-ion63,66 and lithium-polymer18,67,77 batteries have been used to power the
motors and the electronics of these devices, making it
possible to increase portability. These power supplies
remove one of the aspects that tether these devices to
specific locations. However, much work still remains in
reducing power consumption of the electronics, as well
as decreasing the weight of the battery, while extending
the amount of power provided. Power supplies are an
important research area that supports the vision of
these devices being used in a continuous all-day
manner.
It is seen that many of the devices used desktop or
laptop computer systems, off-the-shelf microcontrollers
and other self-contained electronic systems for sensing
or actuation, supporting the idea that developers are
focusing on proof-of-concept development. This development strategy reduces the amount of time and
resources needed to create a functioning prototype.
By using off-the-shelf software systems, mechatronics
engineers are able to prototype devices more rapidly.
The popularity of the Simulink tool for MATLAB
and LabVIEW leans toward the view that engineers in
this field may be more comfortable using visual-based
control system development tools. It may also reflect
the fact that many of these devices are still prototypes
and, therefore, developers are choosing development
tools that they find more effective for rapid prototype
development. One potential limitation of using these
tools is that the control software developed with them
is often not able to be used in the final product.
Existing embedded computer systems are likely to be
unable to meet the processing requirements using software systems developed for desktop computer systems.
These software systems will not typically operate on
these embedded systems. In cases where it is possible

suppressive forces for involuntary motion. The review
of these characteristics reveals trends about the application of these devices.
The targeted body segments were found to be divided into four main upper body sections: hand/fingers,
wrist, elbow, and shoulder. Of the reviewed devices,
87% targeted a single body segment, such as one or
more fingers, the wrist, and the elbow, while 13%
were developed for multiple body segments. All
multi-segment wearable assistive devices were developed such that the multiple targeted segments are
directly connected in series. In total, three devices targeted the elbow and wrist,19–21 two devices targeted the
elbow and shoulder,17,18 one device targeted the wrist
and hand,41 and one device was developed for the
shoulder, elbow, and wrist.16 Figure 7 gives a visual
representation of the attention given to each joint by
developers of the single-segment devices.
In terms of the purpose driving the design of these
devices, there was no specific clinical disease forcing the
constraints or requirements for each design. Instead,
the overlying objective for these devices was the restoration of ADLs in impaired individuals. Nevertheless,
clinical diseases and disorders were referenced in many
of the introductory statements as a motivational explanation, the most common being stroke, which was referenced in 48% of the reviewed articles. Stroke was
cited in most articles due to its prevalence. For
instance, Burton et al. cited stroke as, “the single
most common cause of severe disabilities in the developed world”.48
The specified functionality of each device was found
to be divided into musculoskeletal rehabilitation and
tremor suppression. A review of rehabilitation modalities by Basteris et al. defined a rehabilitation device as
one which can provide motion intention recognition
and provide active assistive or resistive modalities
depending on the patient’s progress.91 Since tremor is
a ND that causes involuntary cyclic motion, the devices
that are designed for this purpose require a different
control architecture and performance constraints than

In this review, the applications of these wearable assistive devices are aimed at assistance with human
motion. Categorization was made in terms of targeted
body segment, purpose, and functionality. The targeted
body segments were defined here as those to which
assistance was actively applied, as opposed to passive
assistance or support. The purpose of each device refers
to the specific motivation behind the research and
design, which is directed towards a musculoskeletal disease or clinical disorder that causes a known impairment. Functionality refers to the type of stimulus that
the device is meant to provide to the wearer, such as
assistive or resistive forces to the target joints, or

body segment.

to execute them on embedded systems, the embedded
systems do not have enough resources to complete the
tasks required of wearable assistive devices in similar
time periods as their desktop counterparts. As a result,
the development periods and costs will be increased to
account for the redevelopment of the control software
in way that enables them to be executed appropriately
on embedded computer systems. This limitation could
be mitigated by using software development methods
and tools that are appropriate for the final product
from the beginning of their development projects.
Reconfigurable computer hardware, such as fieldprogrammable gate arrays, may also be a potential
solution, but have yet to be implemented and reported
by this research community.
Improvements to this research area can be made by
development teams weighing in on what they consider
important aspects of the software and hardware components that are required to replicate or evaluate
results. The vagueness and lack of computer hardware
and software details make it difficult to understand and
reproduce the designs and experiments with wearable
assistive devices. Even basic details of the computer
systems, such as software versions, libraries, operating
system software, model numbers of physical components, and processing resources, would help to mitigate
this issue. One of the most important aspects for
researchers and developers alike is to standardize information about the computer systems of these devices. If
researchers are unable or unwilling to provide basic
computational information, it hinders the evolution
of this field. Many of the computer systems included
in this review operate the device as expected because
the computational environment has more resources
than required. However, a limitation arises as the complexity of the computation grows, while the requirements for power and space on the devices or body
limit the resources available in such embedded computer systems.

Discussion

body segment and functionality. The main applications for these
devices are to either suppress tremor or to assist with musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs).

rehabilitative devices. From the literature, 87% of devices were designed to rehabilitate MSDs, while 13%
were designed to suppress involuntary tremor motion
caused by NDs. Figure 8 shows the normalized distribution of rehabilitative and tremor suppressive devices
for each body segment.
Overall comments and future directions. The results from
the analysis of applications, as seen in Figures 7 and
8, indicate a strong trend toward rehabilitation devices
in the finger and elbow joints. One reason for this result
could be due to limitations in the capabilities of existing
actuation technology. For example, to assist the shoulder joint during rehabilitation procedures, a larger
actuator is required to produce motion of the arm.
Not only would a large motor be heavier and larger,
but the power consumption of the actuator would
require larger power supplies to be carried by the
person wearing the device. This is complicated further
by the fact that the shoulder is a more complex joint
and would require control of multiple degrees-offreedom. Timmermans et al. concluded that recovery
would be drastically improved if focus were equally
placed on distal and proximal joints since ADLs
require full mobility from every active joint.92
Currently, there is no wearable assistive device that
provides active assistance to the entire arm.
Therefore, further research should continue the trend
towards development of multi-segment devices that
provide assistance from the shoulder down to the
fingers.
Due to the complexity of humans and their motion,
it is difficult to define requirements for a particular
disease across all people. This lack of requirement
makes it very challenging to design useful wearable
assistive devices. Many devices examined in this
review are still far from being ready for applications
involving clinical testing.

Developing mechatronic devices to assist with human
motion has been an area of research interest for decades. However, improvements in technology have
enabled an explosion in the development of assistive
devices as wearable entities. In this review, 53 wearable
assistive devices were examined to determine the stateof-the-art of the research and technologies driving their
development. Five main areas, sensing, actuation, control, computation, and applications, were explored to
identify trends and challenges surrounding the development of these devices. The following discussion will
present the general trends in the field of wearable assistive devices, challenges facing each of the five key areas,
and potential solutions to improve these research
domains.

General trends
A major societal problem is supporting the research
demand for wearable assistive devices. The number of
disorders far out-weighs the resources available to
assist with treating them or increasing the quality of
life of individuals suffering from these disorders.
When looking across the reviewed devices, 57% were
developed and presented within the last five years. This
shows that research efforts have more than doubled in
this time period, despite a lack of clear requirements
from clinicians.
The growth of wearable assistive devices is promising and creates a positive outlook for these devices as
solutions to the growing MSD and ND problems.
However, due to the newness of these devices, this
area of research is still quite immature. Currently,
only one commercially available upper-limb wearable
assistive device, the MyoPro, is available for clinical
use. Commercialization may be difficult as clinicians
are hesitant to use tools that are not regulated, while
government agencies are hesitant to regulate tools that
are not used, proven to be safe, or more effective than
traditional interventions. Furthermore, it is difficult to
objectively measure functional improvements in human
motion, which are major criteria desired by both clinicians and device regulators. Wearable assistive devices
offer new opportunities to provide objective measurements of motion parameters, but the research connecting these measurements to patient outcomes is still
limited.
Of the devices presented in the literature, a large
amount of variation is seen among the technologies
and methods used to support these devices.
Exploration of technologies is expected with any
emerging research area, but, in this case, it is likely
due to the inability of technologies to fully meet the

Desplenter et al.
engineering requirements. The novelty of these devices
is also seen from the lack of comparative studies in the
literature. The complexity of these devices and variability of humans makes comparison a difficult task.
Adding the fact that none of the devices are available
commercially, the challenge of duplicating experimental results and performing comparative studies is further increased.
One of the biggest challenges facing the field of
wearable assistive devices is the lack of requirements,
details, and standards in the literature. Many of the
reviewed articles provide potential lists of disorders,
or propose their device for general motion assistance.
This shows that there is a lack of clear requirements
being given to developers from medical professionals
regarding assistance with any particular disorder. In
this review, the inclusion criteria used was not overly
strict, as it stated only that the researchers had to
vaguely describe at least three of the four areas of sensing, actuation, control, and computation. As a result,
many devices were not included in the review as the
descriptions could not meet these criteria. Of the devices that were included, many of them had vague
descriptions of these key areas, supporting a general
lack of information crucial to the research community.
The ability to understand, duplicate, compare, and
improve upon existing research depends highly on the
availability of this information and, therefore, is a hindrance on the evolution of this field.
Device evaluation and safety features were not discussed in general. In some cases, evaluation of engineering criteria is performed on sub-systems, but no
integration or system-level testing was performed and
presented. In other cases, system testing occurs, but
only on a limited number of participants. Either case
makes it difficult to generalize the performance of the
system. Although safety features are typically seen as
later-stage requirements, discussion of the potential
features would assist in creating a positive image of
these devices. These scenarios might be expected of
devices that are still in the prototyping and early development stages. However, performance testing and
safety features are vital for them to become regulated
medical devices. The ability to persuade the community
to adopt these devices relies heavily on the performance
of the device to behave as intended and for their safety
systems to ensure no further harm is done to the enduser as a result of their usage.

Sub-system challenges
Sensing systems, functioning as the feedback link of a
wearable assistive device, play an important role in
proper control system execution and user monitoring.
Based on the review of the existing sensing systems, a

21
number of common limitations were identified, which
include a lack of sensor feedback, insufficient sensing
modalities, and a lack of proper calibration procedures.
A wearable assistive device with open-loop control
does not require the use of sensors. However, the
system performance of such a configuration is often
complemented by the use of fixed-step actuators.
Although the complexity of such configurations is minimized, the overall system accuracy is lower than systems with closed-loop control.
The human upper limb is a complex nonlinear
system, which creates the design requirement for wearable assistive devices to involve multiple sensing modalities in order to achieve high control accuracy.
However, only 40% of systems used multiple sensing
modalities. One reason could be that increasing the
number of sensing modalities increases the computational demand, cost, and system complexity.
Although the performance of a system with a single
sensing modality can be complemented by better control strategies, such limitations still require greater consideration from researchers for the future development
of a wearable assistive device.
Lastly, sensor calibration is often the first step for
validating devices on humans. Due to individual differences, the sensing system should be calibrated individually to achieve optimal performance. For a device
with many sensors, calibration of the sensors may be
costly. However, the potential impact of not calibrating
the system includes compromised system performance,
system failure, and even risks for the user’s safety. As a
result, maximizing adoption of the device must consider the trade-off between the cost and the performance
related to calibration. In this review, the majority of the
systems did not detail the sensor calibration process.
Including this information in the dissemination of
future studies will help to increase device adoption
through an analysis of the trade-off between factors
related to sensing systems and calibration.
Actuation systems are important to enable the interaction between the wearable assistive device and the
human. Through the analysis of the literature, it was
found that DC motors and pneumatic actuators are the
most commonly used actuators. However, these actuation technologies are not meeting the needs of wearable
assistive devices, as the size, weight, and power consumption of the actuators limit the application of the
devices. As a result, there are new types of actuators
being tested and developed.
In addition, some actuators used in the existing devices were not justified as to their usage over alternative
actuators. Information, such as mechanical design, user
interface, or safety considerations, which play a crucial
role in actuation selection, were not always included.
The lack of these considerations could result in a

22
lengthy iterative design process in order to determine
the appropriate actuator and limit the number of commercially available wearable assistive devices.
The control system functions as a behavior regulator
of wearable assistive devices. In this review, it has been
identified that many of the control systems used in
wearable assistive systems employ simple control methods. The prevalence of simplistic binary-based control
methods, such as a threshold controller, is useful for
prototyping, can reduce system costs, and may be suitable for certain applications that rely on abilities of the
user. However, these control methods do not account
for the complexity of the human motor control system
and may not be able to adapt to changes in the user, the
motion task, or the environment. As a result, the simpler control methods may not be viable for many applications that involve users with limited cognitive or
physical abilities. Although complex control models
do exist, their application in wearable assistive devices
may be limited by the available computational resources. Controller complexity also increases overall cost
and may present a greater chance for errors to occur.
In developed cities, cloud computing could be an alternative solution to the computational limitations, but
the availability of network resources may provide a
different set of limitations, especially in remote areas
or cities with limited resources.
The majority of computer systems for these wearable assistive devices are implemented on desktop or
laptop computer systems. Using these computer systems provides platforms that enable faster proof-ofconcept designs and rapid prototyping. However, the
transition to embedded computer systems may result in
lower computational performance, due to the trade-off
between computational resources and other requirements, such as power supplies, electronic components,
or size requirements.
Currently, no device exists to assist the entire upper
limb. This could be partially due to the aforementioned
challenges with actuation technology, power consumption, and computational resources, as well as the novelty of this research domain. However, there are many
rehabilitation activities whose focus is on singlesegment therapy and do not require whole-arm assistive systems. Both types of devices have their usefulness, but require input from application domain
experts for their benefits to be maximized. Mapping
the devices as solutions to particular applications
requires the specification of clinical requirements and
this crucial information is missing from much of the
literature. As a result, the existing devices have, and
will continue to have, a strong bias towards fulfilling
engineering characteristics until clinical characteristics
become available.

Opportunities for advancement
Many of the successes and challenges highlighted in
this review are simply a consequence of the current
state of the research fields surrounding wearable assistive devices. Given more time and continued efforts,
improvements are likely to evolve without much intervention. The interest and existing research activities
afford a promising future. However, the authors have
identified two major strategies that can be used to
accelerate the evolution of these fields.
First, standardization of research, clinical, and engineering information would help development and regulation of these devices. Research efforts could be
better directed and informed if standards for reporting
on wearable assistive devices were created. As seen in
this review, many of the research articles do not provide information sets that are complete enough to
enable duplication of results or allow for detailed comparison of existing devices. Page limitations set by publishers in the fields surrounding mechatronic devices
could be causing this issue. Providing a reporting standard could allow for new article formats from publishers, specific to these research areas, and enable the
community to access the details required to disseminate
the research. Another area of possible standardization
would be regarding the requirements for MSDs and
NDs. Characteristics of these disorders may vary
between patients, but the fact that disorders can be
identified and classified, means there are common
properties. Working with medical professionals, developers could generate sets of requirements, for each disorder, that enable more focused research efforts. The
last area for potential standardization is within the
evaluation and testing of wearable assistive devices.
Currently, no testing standards or templates exist,
even for engineering metrics. Testing protocols need
to be customized based on many factors, but some
guidelines or general processes are of great importance
to the evolution of this research domain. Furthermore,
small sample sizes and poor statistical analyses make it
difficult to generalize conclusions from the findings or
compare across these studies. Providing a base set of
evaluation tools for the community would help to alleviate this problem.
Second, promotion and further development of a
multidisciplinary culture is required to develop wearable assistive devices and realize their social benefit.
The complexity of these devices, their components,
and the end-user requires experts from many engineering domains to build systems that meet functional
requirements. Although the engineering fields have
shown great progress, the existing devices may never
be integrated into clinical practices if input from other
stakeholders, such as government regulation agencies,

Desplenter et al.
clinicians, industry representatives, researchers, and
end-users, are not included into the development processes. Methods for producing solutions to complex
multidisciplinary problems, such as the development
of wearable assistive devices, already exist in other
domains. For example, software engineering has proposed and shown the value of development processes,
which include non-engineering stakeholders. Involving
more views into the design process requires more
resources, but helps ensure that each device provides
the maximum benefit for its intended purpose of assisting with human motion.

Conclusion
This article presented a thorough review of the literature related to wearable and assistive mechatronic devices for upper limb rehabilitation. Although only one
device is commercially available, many devices have
been developed and tested by the research community.
The review of 53 wearable assistive upper-limb mechatronic devices shows a variety of solutions being
explored as part of their sensing systems, actuation
systems, control systems, and computer hardware and
software. In general, devices are still far from being
applied in clinical tests in a way that will provide
useful and consistent patient care. Further progress
into all of these areas is needed in order to improve
portability, responsiveness, comfort, and safety.
