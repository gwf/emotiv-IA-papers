Abstract. The research examines the influence of price as product cues on consumer’s perception and evaluation by
using the application of electroencephalogram (EEG). This method can give objective information about consumer
reactions towards product cues that will drive consumer’s choice. The main research objective was to observe and
evaluate consumer’s brain activity in different brain regions while they were being exposed by several price levels
(low, medium, high) of underwear as stimuli and focused mainly on liking/disliking the stimuli. The participants
consist of 10 female and 10 male consumers within 18-24 years old, have normal vision, right handed, and
considered as potential purchasers of underwear. The participant’s brain activity was collected using Emotiv EPOC
neuroheadset (EEG) with international 10/20 system and was obtained in Beta frequency bands (13–30 Hz). The
result indicated that there was a clear and significant change (p<0.05) in the EEG brain spectral activities of right and
left hemisphere in the frontal (F3 & F4), temporal (T7 & T8), and parietal (P7 & P8) regions when participants
indicated their attentiveness towards each price level stimulus. The results show, the male and female participant’s
tactile sensations in parietal lobe does not give more favorable attention towards particular price stimulus, but the
difference price perceptions in parietal lobe can lead to rational preference and give most favored response towards
high price stimulus. Analyzing of price perception may help to understand the differences in price-related emotions
and preference, which can gain insights into an alternative pricing strategy that can lead to influence consumers
buying decision.

Introduction

to consumers’ general limitations of price
knowledge and cognitive capacity in order to
compare all offered price information,
behavioral pricing research reflects how
consumers actually perceive, evaluate, and
respond to price information (Estelami and
Maxwell 2003; Skouras, Avlonitis, and
Indounas. 2005; Müller-Hagedorn and
Kierdorf 2007).

Price is a key tool and significant determinant
of consumers' purchase decisions, also
excessively used to attract consumers to a
certain product. Different ways of price level
have different impacts on consumer’s
perception and furthermore on their
purchase decisions. The fact that consumers
react differently towards price stimulus is
widely known. identical price stimulus can be
evaluated differently by several persons
(Diller 2008). The fact that consumers
respond differently facing prices is a main
focus of behavioral pricing research.
Behavioral pricing research can be regarded
as an extension of the traditionally economic
pricing theory, which is based on the
assumption of a rational thinking buyer
according to the “Homo economicus”. Due

Several studies have advocated that price
perception is a complex and broad stimulus
which consists of positive and negative cues
to consumers (Lichtenstein, Ridgway, and
Netemeyer,1993). Many research in the
consumer literature has demonstrated that
consumers use higher prices as being
indicative of greater product quality (Rao and
Monroe, 1989).To influence consumers’ price
perception of a certain product is an

important challenge for marketers (Diller
2008).The relationship between price and
perceptions is a relatively understudied
research field. The few existing studies show
that attention and emotion play an important
role in price-related contexts (O’Neill and
Lambert, 2001) and that they can mediate the
impact of price perceptions on shopping
intentions (Zielke, 2011).

electronics (Hamzaoui & Merunka, 2006; Hui
& Zhou, 2003; Lee & Ganesh, 1999) and
automobiles (Hamzaoui & Merunka, 2006).
Very little research has been done with
underwear as an object, due to the fact that it
was considered as boring and private product
category. Taking into account the fact that
underwear consumer is part of a largely
untapped consumer group whose their
buying decisions are relatively still unknown.

Underwear is everybody basic needs,
currently in the apparel marketplace,
underwear became one of product category
that growing rapidly both in innovative
design and technology (Askin, 2004; Capelaci,
2006). Thus in the future this industry still
will grow, profitable, and become one of
potential product category in the market
(Nugrahani, 2013).

The previous research findings, have been
stated that consumer information processing
in underwear product are involving
multisensory integration of information,
mostly based on visual and tactile (Fiore,
2000). To making sense of consumers choice
towards underwear products, besides
conducting survey, it is helpful to understand
their actions in conjunction with their neural
response mechanisms especially when other
senses are involved in the choosing process,
such as vision and tactile (Knutson, Rick,
Wimmer, Prelec, & Loewenstein, 2007).

Nowadays the market trends are changing
and consumers are looking underwear
category for both function and fashion.
Underwear
products
that
previously
considered as inner wear now being designed
as leisure wear and meant to be worn as
outerwear, many customers look at
undergarments as a style statement and has
equal emphasis as their outerwear garments
(Bailey, 2005). This challenging condition is
making it difficult for managers to identify
particular pricing strategy that can influence
consumer’s buying decisions in the increasing
undifferentiated underwear market. However
many companies are possessing variety of
product price strategy to influence
consumer’s buying decision. This s makes it
even more challenging and complicated for
consumers to rationally take decisions
regarding product quality (Hume & Michael,
2013).

To making sense of consumer’s price
perception in underwear products, it is
helpful to understand their actions in
conjunction with their brain response
mechanisms that happened during active
evaluation of products and have been found
can predict consumer preference (Kushaba,
et al., 2013). While underwear is an intimate
apparel that very private for most of people,
and it was still believed taboo to become a
topic of discussion. Based on that situations,
many
consumer’s

uncomfortable and not reveal “what they feel”
and “what is their preference”. By using
electroencephalogram (EEG) to get the
consumer’s brain response, will provide
strong evidence how is the effect of
consumer’s perception can affect their
preference, also contribute to marketers
knowledge of the “why” behind the
consumer’s buying decisions regarding
underwear product, that can help marketers
to reach their target markets more effectively
and develop strategies to ensure that the
consumer’s needs are met.

Underwear is common privately consumed
product category in apparels. However,
previous studies in this context have
documented that underwear got inherently
deficient in the literature. The recent study
have
focused
on
publicly
visible,
conspicuously consumed products such as
fashion apparel and accessories (Phau & Yip,
2008; Kim, Knight, & Pelton, 2009; Jin, Park,

This study portray price perception among
consumers with different stimulus of price
level. Specifically, by comparing the
differences in consumer’s brain activity
(EEG) among the price level perceptions.
The objective of this study is the effect of
price level perceptions towards price
preference of underwear product by
comparing the differences in consumer’s

perception may help to understand the
differences in price-related emotions and

on the person’s frame of references that
consists of all the previous consumer’s
experiences, beliefs, likes, dislikes, prejudices,
feelings and other psychological reactions of
unknown origin. The perceptions process is
also complicated due to the possibility that
individuals may be stimulated below their
level of conscious awareness. In the
perception process, exposure is the first step
that occurred. Exposure occurs when a
stimulus comes within the range of our
sensory receptor nerves. Exposure is
therefore simply the minimum requirements
of perception. Exposure is very important
because no matter how great a message is, it
will not be perceived unless a person is
exposed to the stimulus (Wells, Turtle, &
Luus, 1989).

Literature Review

2.1. Price
Price is what is given up or sacrificed to
obtain a product in consumer’s perspective.
Price is used as a quality indicator when other
cues available are limited, when the product
cannot be evaluated before purchase, and
when there is some degree of risk inherent in
making wrong choice; a key variable that
influences consumers’ purchase intention
(Idoko, Ireneus, Nkamnebe, & Okoye, 2013).
In an experimental setting, Jacoby and Olson
(1977) distinguished between objective price
(the actual price of a product) and perceived
price (the price as encoded by the
consumer).The price of a particular product
is one of the key tools in understanding
consumer choice (Bijmolt, van Heerde, &
Pieters, 2005). Researchers have investigated
the social role of price in decision-making
(Amaldoss & Jain , 2005) and errors made by
consumers when processing the price of an
item (Bizer & Schindler, 2005).

2.3. Consumer Preference
An important issue in marketing is how
consumers form preference for products or
services, because preference is one of the
factors that give big influence to choice. The
term “preferences” can be used in a variety
ways, one could interpret the term
“preference” to mean evaluative judgment in
the sense of liking or disliking an object
when a person likes one of the alternatives
more than /the other, he has developed
preference for the one liked and is more
likely to choose it. Preference is also used
primarily to mean an option that has the
greatest value among a number of options
(Blackwell, 2006). This refers to a choice
between alternatives and the possibility of
rank ordering of these alternatives, based on
the degree of happiness, satisfaction,
gratification, enjoyment, or utility they
provide.

2.2. Perception
Perception is a mental (cognitive) process
that involves using previous knowledge to
gather and interpret the stimuli gathered by
the senses. Thus perception involves input
and recognition of sensory experience
(Walters, Bergiel , & Sheth, 1989). Van Der
Walt (1991) adds that perception occurs
when sensory receptors receive stimuli via
the brain, code and categories them and
assign certain meanings to them, depending

2.4. Electroencephalogram (EEG)
The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a
measure of brain waves that provides
evidence of how the brain functions over
time (Tong & Thakor, 2009). Nowadays,
EEG are increasingly used by marketing
scholars and practitioner to get consumer’s
deeper reactions to various marketing stimuli
(Ariely, Berns, Moore, & Noussair, 2010).
The general assumption is that human brain
activity can provide marketers objective

60

The Asian Journal of Technology Management Vol. 9 No. 1 (2016): 58-65

information that not obtainable via
conventional marketing research methods.
This is mainly driven by the fact that people
cannot fully explain their preferences when
explicitly asked in the level of conscious
awareness. The EEG records are seen as
indicator of consumer’s true emotions and
feeling because there are several activations in
certain regions in the brain that may suggest
the
consumer’s
unfiltered
response
(Davidson, 1992). EEG is possible to gather
immediate feedback to presented stimuli as
fluctuations in brain signal frequencies to
learn more about attention, perception, and
emotion (Vecchiato, et al., 2011) and also
provides a richer context to understand
consumer choice and decision making
process in marketing research (Ohme,
Reykowska, Wiener, & Choromanska, 2009).

The participants were asked to evaluate
several underwear color and brand elements.
Each data was recorded using OpenVIBE
0.13.0 and EPOC Panel Control software and
was analyzed by MATLAB R2009a which
complemented
with
EEGLAB.
For
underwear’s price evaluation, a blind test was
also used. The participants were told to touch
three different underwear, each for 30s with
3s inter-stimulus-interval, and repeated 3
times with the inter block interval (IBI) 10-15
minutes. Each of underwear was told have
different price (low price, medium price, and
high price). The electrodes were located on
F3- F4, T7 -T8 and P7-P8.
EEG data processing begins with selecting
the raw data obtained from the EEG data
recording. The raw data from Emotiv being
translated to be numeric data in the form of
csv file. Then the raw data was processed
through several stages below:
1. Offset removal, is the noise waveform
(waves with 0 frequency) filter (band-pass
filter).
2. Artifact removal, is filter for the artifacts
waveform due to participant’s muscle
movement such as eye blinking or head
movements. The disposal of artifacts
waveform made with the assumption that
the amplitude of artifacts is 2.5 times
greater than the average brain wave signals.
Thus the signals with amplitudes greater

Result and Discussion

Data pooling of beta wave spectrum in
channel F3 was compared with channel F4
(Frontal Lobe), channel P7 with channel P8
(Occipital Lobe), also channel T7 was
compared with channel T8 (Temporal Lobe)
to determine EEG asymmetry for the left
hemispheres (F3, P7, and T7) and right
hemispheres (F4, P8, and T8). Based on the
result of underwear price evaluation (Figure
2), when the stimulus was given, generally the
beta brainwaves amplitude of male and
female participants increase compared with
baseline values in each brain lobe (occipital
lobe, temporal lobe, and frontal lobe). The
results indicate that underwear price stimulus
generally can modulate the activity of
neurons in parietal, temporal, and frontal area
becomes more active. This is caused due to
the transient effects of underwear price
stimulus in the tactile pathwayas natural
adaptations towards the environmental
conditions.

For female participants results (Figure 2),
shows that the amplitude value in left
hemisphere is higher than right hemisphere,
whether in parietal lobe (P7-P8), frontal lobe
(F3-F4), and temporal lobe (T7-T8). Based
on paired sample t- test in each lobe, there
are significant difference between amplitude
activity in left and right hemisphere, P7-P8 t
(6.717) =8.559, p<0, 05; T7-T8 t (6.162)
=15.772, p<0.05; F3-F4 t (10.761) =14.501
p<0.05. Based on the results, generally
female participants give positive response
towards all underwear price stimulus.
Furthermore, female participant’s data in
each brain lobe (P7-P8, T7-T8, and F3-F4)
was analysing by using One-Way ANOVA
test. The results show there is no real
difference between the beta waves amplitude
of each underwear price stimulus in parietal
lobe P7-P8 p=0.65>0,05. This can be
happened because they had been given the
same sensory tactile information (same
fabrics), so they feel quite same tactile
sensations. However the price perception in
each price stimulus is difference (T7-T8
p=0.00<0.05) based on temporal lobe results
and high price has the highest amplitude
value among all stimulus. This results also
found in frontal lobe F3-F4 p=0.002 <0.05,
female participants response differently
towards each underwear price stimulus and

a

high price has the highest amplitude value
among all stimulus. We conclude, however
the female participant’s tactile sensations in
parietal lobe does not give more favourable
attention towards particular price stimulus,
but the difference price perceptions in
parietal lobe can lead to rational preference
(the frontal lobe) and give favoured response
to the high price stimulus.

were given. Furthermore, male participant’s
data in each brains lobe (P7-P8, T7-T8, and
F3-F4) was analysed by using One-Way
ANOVA test. The results shows, there is

difference between
beta

each brain lobe, parietal lobe P7-P8
p=0.03<0, 05; F3-F4 p=0.00<0.05; and T7T8 p=0.01<0.05, that indicate the male
participant respond differently towards each
underwear price stimulus. Generally the beta
brainwaves amplitude value of high price
stimulus is the highest among all stimulus
(low price and medium price), whether in
parietal lobe (P7-P8), temporal lobe (T7-T8),
and frontal lobe (F3-F4). The results indicate
the difference of consumer price perception
(temporal lobe) can lead to different touching
sensations (parietal lobe) and different price
choice in male participants. Based on the
results, male participants give more
favourable choice towards high price, same as
female participants. In this case, male and
female tend to use price as an indicator of
product quality. Thus price might be an
indicator of perceived quality of underwear
(Dapkevicius & Borisas, 2009). This result
similar with Lambert (1772), Shapiro (1973),
and Olson (1977) that stated price reliance is
a general tendency in some consumers to
depend on price as a cue to quality. In several
studies (Zeithaml, 1988; Kotler et al., 2003;
and Bou-Llusar, Camisón-Zornoza, &
Escrig-Tena, 2001), overall association
between price and perceived quality is high.

Conclusions

The result of this study shows the male and
female participant’s tactile sensations in
parietal lobe does not give more favourable
attention towards particular price stimulus,
but the difference price perceptions in
parietal lobe can lead to rational preference
and give most favoured response towards
high price stimulus. The current study
highlights the applications of neuroscience in
order to fully explore the decision-making
process from the perspective of underwear
consumer’s that can give objective
information about the inner workings of the
consumer brains. It will provide the insight

While in male participants results (Figure 3),
most of beta brainwaves amplitude value in
left hemisphere is higher than right
hemisphere, whether in parietal lobe (P7-P8),
frontal lobe (F3-F4), and temporal lobe (T7T8). Based on paired sample t- test in each
lobe, P7-P8 t (12.753) =7.790, p<0, 05; F3F4 t (19.16) =13.735, p<0.05; and T7-T8 t
(9.7926) =11.126 p<0.05, there are
significant difference between amplitude
activity in left and right hemisphere. So
generally, the male participants give positive
response towards all fabrics stimulus that
