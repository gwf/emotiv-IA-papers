ABSTRACT
Objective Investigations into surgical expertise
have almost exclusively focused on overt behavioral
characteristics with little consideration of the underlying
neural processes. Recent advances in neuroimaging
technologies, for example, wireless, wearable scalp-­
recorded electroencephalography (EEG), allow an insight
into the neural processes governing performance. We
used scalp-­recorded EEG to examine whether surgical
expertise and task performance could be differentiated
according to an oscillatory brain activity signal known as
frontal theta—a putative biomarker for cognitive control
processes.
Design, setting, and participants Behavioral and EEG
data were acquired from dental surgery trainees with 1
year (n=25) and 4 years of experience (n=20) while they
performed low and high difficulty drilling tasks on a virtual
reality surgical simulator. EEG power in the 4–7 Hz range in
frontal electrodes (indexing frontal theta) was examined as
a function of experience, task difficulty and error rate.
Results Frontal theta power was greater for novices
relative to experts (p=0.001), but did not vary according
to task difficulty (p=0.15) and there was no Experience ×
Difficulty interaction (p=0.87). Brain–behavior correlations
revealed a significant negative relationship between frontal
theta and error in the experienced group for the difficult
task (r=−0.594, p=0.0058), but no such relationship
emerged for novices.
Conclusion We find frontal theta power differentiates
between surgical experiences but correlates only with
error rates for experienced surgeons while performing
difficult tasks. These results provide a novel perspective
on the relationship between expertise and surgical
performance.

INTRODUCTION
Highly skilled surgeons have the ability
to monitor and rapidly adapt to changes
in the environment, appropriately tune
into relevant information variables, select
from a large repertoire of possible sensorimotor commands and execute with a
smoothness that belies their many years of
training.1 2 While the majority of research on
surgical performance has examined the overt

Key messages
What is already known about this subject?
►► Surgical training involves developing the ability to

carry out complex sequences of action selection
and execution processes. The majority of previous
work has focused on the overt behavioral outputs of
training, with little understanding of the underlying
cognitive mechanisms that govern these processes.

What are the new findings?
►► Using wireless, wearable electroencephalography

(EEG) we examined changes in an oscillatory brain
activity signal known as frontal theta as experienced
and novice dental surgeons completed easy and
difficult simulated surgical tasks. We show frontal
theta can differentiate between surgical experiences, with higher frontal theta power for novices, but
in a reversal of this global pattern, find signal power
reduction with error commission in experts.

How might these results affect future
research or surgical practice?
►► These results point towards a more nuanced inter-

pretation of the relationship between expertise and
performance—one that may be modulated by cognitive control.
►► In longer term, there is potential for EEG to inform
training content to optimize learning and be used to
monitor performance in the operating theater in real
time.

examined through post hoc surveys5),
there have been very few investigations into
the underlying cognitive mechanisms that
mediate the ability to carry out the complex
sequences of action selection and execution
required for surgical practice (see ref 6 for a
review).

suppressing irrelevant motor responses are clustered
under the label of ‘cognitive control’ (also referred to as
‘executive function’7). One putative neural correlate of
cognitive control is a pattern of oscillatory brain activity
known as ‘frontal theta’—a signal that can be observed
on the scalp through electroencephalography (EEG)
recordings and quantified by calculating signal power in
the 4–7 Hz range.8
Frontal theta is considered to be critical in performance
monitoring9 10 and core to error detection10 11—the key
to triggering selection and prioritization of information
processing12 13 and subsequent action.14 15 The recruitment of these ‘top down’ control processes is heightened
in scenarios where automatic processes are insufficient for
successful adaptation to the current environment,7 with
the prefrontal cortex responsible for engaging a broad
network of systems involved in goal-­directed actions.16–20
To our knowledge, there has been no examination into
the relationship between this neural signal and surgical
performance to date.
Extant theories of skill acquisition often describe a shift
from deliberate to automatic action selection and execution, with requisite reductions in the working memory
requirements during the performance of a highly practiced action.21 A recent unifying framework for theories
of cognition and action—known as the ‘Free Energy
Principle’—proposes that the neocortex (involved in
higher order functions, such as sensory perception and
spatial reasoning) constantly makes inferences about the
world and learns from experiences through the violation
of its predictions.22 Viewed in this framework, frontal
theta activity could serve as both a teaching signal for
the system to learn that it needs to refine its prediction
for the future and simultaneously, trigger the cognitive
resources required to produce adaptive control.23 A more
accurate world model would require fewer behavioral
adjustments and thus, a reduction in the need to recruit
cognitive control.
Predicated on this theory and evidence from neuroscience, we examined whether frontal theta activity could
be used to distinguish between experienced and novice
dental surgery trainees on a simulated drilling task
carried out on a high-­fidelity virtual reality simulator. We
predicted that overall, novice participants would exhibit
greater task-­related theta activity, reflecting greater top-­
down engagement of cognitive control processes relative
to their more experienced counterparts. Second, given
that behavioral adaptation following prediction error is a
hallmark of learning, we expected a relationship between
performance errors and frontal theta activity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
The data used for this study were obtained from undergraduate students of School of Dentistry, University of
Leeds. The participants were assigned into two groups (as
per their level of expertise). Forty-­five participants were
2

recruited with 25 first year dental students (the novice
group: 16 female and 9 male, age=20.32±2.54 years) and
20 fourth year dental students (experienced group: 17
female and 3 male, age=23.7±0.58 years). Participants
from both groups were recruited during the same period
week period) through opportunity
of time (over a 2-­
sampling and the experimenter was blinded to the group
which participants belonged up until the point of testing.
The sessions were booked through an online form where
participants indicated the most suitable time during
the hours the laboratory was available between 09:00
and 17:00. All participants were right-­handed, provided
informed consent and were fully debriefed.
Experimental tasks
Participants completed the experiment on a haptic
virtual reality dental simulator (Simodont; Moog FCS,
Nieuw Vennep, Amsterdam, The Netherlands)). The
simulator has previously been shown to have construct24 25
and predictive validity26 with real-­world dental tasks. In
this experiment, participants were asked to use the simulator to drill holes in two virtual shapes, with task difficulty
operationalized as a function of the geometric complexity
of the shape. The ‘Low Difficulty’ task involved drilling
a simple straight shape, while the ‘High Difficulty’ task
required participants to drill out a cross-­shaped object.
Each shape comprised three regions: (1) a ‘Target’—
participants were instructed that they must be removed;
(2) a ‘Leeway’ area—which surrounded the target region
on the sides and bottom (participants were instructed to
avoid removing as much of this as possible); and (3) a
‘Container’ area on the sides and bottom surrounding
the leeway zone and represented as a brown-­
colored
region that participants were instructed that they must
avoid during drilling (see figure 1). The goal for participants was drill/cut 99% of the target region while minimizing drilling in the leeway and avoiding the container
regions as fast as they possibly could. To avoid potentially confounding order effects, we counterbalanced the

presentation of the shapes across participants. Specifically, half the participants in each group performed the
Low Difficulty task first followed by the High Difficulty
task and the other half performed the High Difficulty task
first followed by the Low Difficulty task.
EEG acquisition device
EEG data were recorded using an Emotiv Epoc+ EEG
wireless headset (Emotiv Systems, San Francisco, California). This system includes 14 active electrodes placed
across the scalp according to the international 10-20
system (labeled AF3, AF4, F3, F4, F7, F8, FC5, FC6, P7, P8,
T7, T8, O1 and O2) with two reference electrodes placed
on mastoids bone behind the ear (common mode sense-­
left mastoid)/(driven right leg-­
right mastoid) ground
(figure 1). The signal from each electrode was converted
to digital form via a 16-­bit analogy to digital converter,
with a sampling frequency of 128 Hz.
Procedure
All data collection was carried out in the Dental Simulation suite at the University of Leeds. The dental suite
houses 30 simulators and is primarily designed for undergraduate and postgraduate dental students to practice. To
provide a controlled environment for this study and to
minimize the impact noise, each experiment took place
in isolation, with the experimenter (AMB) testing one
participant on one simulator at a time. The total duration of the study for each participant was approximately
15–20 min. Once participants were comfortably seated
at the simulator, the EEG recording system was placed
on the heads according to the manufacturer’s instructions. At this point (and prior to recording), participants received an introduction (lasting approximately
5–10 min) to the simulator from the experimenter and
the tasks to be performed (figure 1). The EEG data were
recorded continuously during the first dental task until
the participants achieved the target performance level
identified by the dental simulator. There was a 2 min
break between the first and second tasks for all participants and the order in which participants completed the
tasks was counterbalanced between participants.
Data analyses
EEG data analysis
As the EEG signals observed on the scalp are inherently
noisy, we undertook a number of preprocessing steps
before statistical analysis. Raw EEG data were preprocessed for artifact removal and band decomposition using
Brain Electrical Source Analysis (BESA; MEGIS Software,
Gräfelfing, Germany). A linear finite impulse response
filter was used to band pass the data between 1 and 20 Hz
to remove the DC offset, line noise and other unwanted
signals beyond the region of interest. Artifacts in the data
were eliminated using an automatic artifact rejection
routine implemented in BESA known as the ‘surrogate
method’, which takes a multiple source approach to

correcting eye artifacts and models brain activity using a
fixed dipole method.27
Following this, we isolated theta band oscillations (4–7 Hz)
from the channels in the frontal region of the scalp (F7,
F8, AF3, AF4, F3, F4) and band power was computed every
quarter of a second using Welch’s method, which estimates
the power spectra based on a fast Fourier transform.28 29 It
is important to note here that while we could also have
extracted estimates for other frequency bands associated
with sensorimotor planning and performance (eg, alpha,30 31
beta32), we had no strong a priori hypotheses for doing so in
this particular study. Given the limited sample size available,
coupled with the multidimensional nature of EEG signals—
which allow researchers large analytical df,33 we opted against
such analyses to avoid inflating the chances of type II error.
Finally, our measure of frontal theta was computed by averaging activity across the frontocentral region. This improved
the signal-­to-­noise ratio by minimizing the impact of any one
single channel. One participant from the novice group had
excessively noisy EEG data, with values more than three times
the SD of the mean in the high and low difficult tasks, and
was thus excluded from all analyses.
Statistical analysis
For behavior, we measured performance on the total error
(quantified as percentages of drilling in the leeway regions).
All measures were tested for normality to ensure the data
met requirements for valid analysis of variance (ANOVA),
by Q–Q plots and Shapiro-­Wilk test. A 2×2 mixed ANOVA
was conducted to compare performance across expertise
(Novices vs Experts) × Task Difficulty (High vs Low) for
each dependent variable. Correlation analyses were used
to examine the relationship between frontal theta and the
amount of error in the behavioral data for both the Low
Difficulty and High Difficulty tasks for each group using a
Pearson correlation. Comparisons of the magnitude of two
correlations were performed where significant correlation
was found using Hittner, May and Silver’s (2003)34 modification of Dunn and Clark’s (1969)35 approach using a back-­
transformed average Fisher’s Z procedure in the ‘cocor’
package for R.36 The statistical significance threshold was set
at p<0.05 and we report generalized eta squared (ηG2) as a
measure of effect size and considered ηG2=0.02 to be small,
ηG2=0.13 medium and ηG2=0.26 to be a large effect size. To
provide a measure of between-­subject variability, we calculated coefficient of variation (CV) scores by dividing the
SD of all scores from the mean of all scores and expressed
as a percentage by multiplying this value by 100 for each
condition: (σ/μ)*100. To capture within-­subject variability
between the Low Difficulty and High Difficulty tasks, we
calculated an intrasubject CV, where for each participant,
the SD of the two observations was divided by the mean of
those observations and multiplied by 100. The mean average
CV% value across participants was taken as a measure of
within-­subject variability of the group. All statistical analyses
were performed using R V.3.5.2 (20 December 2018) and
RStudio V.1.1.463.37

Figure 2 Group and task-­related differences in behavior and
neural activity. (A) Experienced participants made few errors
relative to novice participants and participants made fewer
errors in the Low Difficulty task relative to the High Difficulty
task. (B) On average, the experienced group showed lower
theta activity relative to novice participants. There was no
reliable difference in theta activity as a function of task
difficulty.

RESULTS
For behavioral performance (figure 2A), we found a significant effect of group (F(1,42)=41.18, p<0.001, ηG2=0.41).
As expected,24 error rates were higher for novice participants (M=16.51, 95% CI 14.99 to 18) relative to the experienced participants (M=9.68, 95% CI 8.16 to 11.2). There
was also a significant effect of task difficulty (F(1,42)=5.3,
p=0.03, ηG2=0.04), with more errors occurring in the High
Difficulty task (M=13.9, 95% CI 12.6 to 15.1) relative to the
Low Difficulty variant (M=12.3, 95% CI 11 to 13.6). There
was no interaction between task difficulty and group
(F(1,42)=0.16, p=0.69, ηG2=0.001). Novice participants in
the Low Difficulty condition had the highest intersubject
CV score (37.71%), which reduced to 28.60% in the High
Difficulty condition. Experienced participants’ CV scores
also reduced from Low Difficulty (25.90%) to High Difficulty (20.98%). For intrasubject CV we found marginally
more variability in the novice group (19%) relative to the
expert group (16.89%).
For our EEG measure of cognitive control (figure 2B),
there was a significant main effect of group (F(1,42)=12.05,
p=0.001, ηG2=0.15), with frontal theta activity greater for
novices (M=1.23, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.43) relative to experienced participants (M=0.72, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.93),
indicating an increase in the recruitment of cognitive
control. However, there was no difference across tasks
(F(1,42)=2.11, p=0.15, ηG2=0.02) and no interaction
(F(1,42)=0.03, p=0.87, ηG2<0.001). It is notable that for
frontal theta power, we observed much larger degree of
dispersion of scores across the group means compared
with our behavioral error measure. The most variability
was observed in the novice participants in the Low Difficulty condition (score 89.19%), which reduced to 52.24%
in the High Difficulty condition. For experienced participants, the easy task had an intersubject CV score of
50.43%, which increased marginally in the High Difficulty
condition (55.71%). The intrasubject CV was also larger
for this measure relative to error, with a score of 32.68%
for novices and 27.61% for experienced participants.

Figure 3 The relationship between behavioral performance
and neural activity. Panel (A) shows no correlation between
task error and frontal theta, but the experienced participants
in the High Difficulty task exhibited a strong negative
correlation indicating that better performance was linked to
greater theta activity (B).

Finally, given the variability in our data, we explored
whether the amount of frontal theta activity exhibited
by participants could be correlated with the amount of
behavioral error within each of our groups and across
the two tasks. We found a significant negative correlation
between frontal theta activity and behavioral error rates
in the experienced group while completing the High
Difficulty task (r=−0.594, n=20, p=0.0058). In other words,
smaller behavioral errors were associated with greater
theta activity while higher error rates were correlated with
lower theta activity in this High Difficulty task for expert
participants. We found no other statistically significant
relationships (r’s<0.16; p’s>0.46). To examine whether
this observed relationship between neural activity and task
error for our experienced group in the High Difficulty
task was significantly greater than the pattern found in the
novice group (figure 3), we compared the magnitude of
the two correlations and confirmed that the patterns were
reliably different from one another (z=2.1779, p=0.0294).
DISCUSSION
Expert surgical performance is marked by seemingly
effortless, flexible behavior38 that typically manifests in
smoother movements, shorter operating times and fewer
errors.39 40 This behavior is the product of a distributed
network of neural circuitry that takes a complex sequence
of action selection and planned motor execution plan
and refines over time to ensure smooth and seemingly
automatic performance.41 42 However, there have been
very few investigations into the neural processes linking
brain and behavior in the surgical domain,43–51 with technological constraints limiting the ability to probe the
neural underpinnings of surgical performance.
We took advantage of recent advances in wireless EEG
technology to understand these processes in more detail.
We reasoned that a specific neural signal, referred to
as frontal theta, a putative marker of cognitive control,
would distinguish between experienced and novice dental
students. We hypothesized that novice participants would

require the recruitment of more cognitive resources to
carry out the task relative to their more experienced
counterparts and in line with this expectation, we found
an increase in frontal theta activity for the novice.
We also found that the relationship between
this signal and error correction was specific only
to experts when performing difficult tasks. These
results were not predicted a priori, and the result
appears to indicate a reversal in the relationship
between theta activity and performance and as such
it is worth considering the nature of this relationship
in detail. Here, in contrast to the global pattern in
which theta power was greater for the novices relative to the experts, we found larger theta power for
experts who made fewer errors. To understand the
processes underlying this phenomenon, consider the
example of a learner driver stepping into the driving
seat for the first time. We can imagine that our
student is keen to learn and thus extremely attentive
to the stimuli visible on the road ahead. However,
it is also clear that there is a limit to the performance levels that could reasonably be expected of
our student—irrespective of the amount of attentional resources that might be recruited for the task.
In this context, making the driving conditions more
hazardous is unlikely to modulate the relationship
between cognitive control and performance to any
reasonable degree, given that performance levels are
low and attentional allocation is already high. Now
contrast this with a more experienced driver, fewer
attentional resources are required relative to the
learner to exercise a higher level of performance.
But if we heighten the task demands, say through
poor weather conditions, we can reason that those
who make fewer errors are also likely to be the
individuals with increased allocation of attentional
resources. Note that for this analogy to apply to
the present results, our experienced drivers should
make enough errors for sufficiently worse performance, but not to the point of task failure. Indeed,
on average, our experts’ behavioral performance far
exceeded that of the novice participants.
These results also speak to a more general issue
of the relationship between expertise and performance. Expert surgeons are often, as in this study,
considered a homogenous group and their performance benchmarked against trainee groups. 52 53
The present results indicate the existence of a more
nuanced perspective on the relationship between
experts and performance. While on average, their
performance may be better than trainees (on metrics
relating to time and error), the performance of any
one individual is likely to be modulated by a number
of factors. While the present data do not speak to
causality, they do indicate a correlation between the
amount of attentional allocation and performance in
experienced participants and this may be a factor to
consider in future comparisons—from experimental

design (eg, motivation and distraction) to measurement and statistical analysis (examining heterogeneity within expert groups).
Some limitations of the present work are worth
noting: while our sample size was comparable to the
majority of previous research in this area, future
research with larger sample sizes that have sufficient
power to test the reliability of the brain—-behavior
relationships identified here would be welcome.
Reproducibility is the hallmark of science and we
encourage replication tests of the results reported
in this experiment. It is also important to note that
our sample comprised dental surgery trainees who
differed in 3 years of experience. Exploring these
relationships across different levels of experiences
and specialties will be important in testing the generalizability of these findings.
Given the increasingly lower costs of EEG technology
and the ease in which these newer wearable systems
can be incorporated within surgical simulation it is
worth considering the potential benefits of doing so.
While the recording of EEG in real-­w orld settings is
very much in its infancy, evidence is growing on the
potential utility of this approach across a range of
settings that could be instructive for surgical settings.
For example, EEG signals are commonly used to
trigger brain–computer interface robotic devices to
support movement rehabilitation following stroke. 54
Central to this approach is the need for individuals
to be able self-­r egulate brainwave frequencies—a skill
that is developed through neurofeedback training.
This neurofeedback approach has also been used to
optimize performance in neurologically healthy populations in a variety of tasks (see ref 55 for a review) with
some work on developing surgical skills.56 Examining
the long-­t erm impact of such training for surgical skill
development is key to advancing the implementation
of these technologies.
With EEG providing a continuous measure of
neural activity with temporal precision in the order
of milliseconds, the signal could also be used to
monitor performance and inform the provision of
training content. Preliminary work has shown theta
power can track changes in mental workload in military settings.57 With the majority of surgical incidents
related to cognitive limitations,58 such an approach
could potentially be used to self-­
monitor cognitive
functioning in the operating theater. In the classroom, measuring frontal theta power may present
an adjunct to existing measures of learning (which
primarily focus on overt behavioral end-­p oint performance) and allow trainers to modulate task difficulty
to optimize skill acquisition within a training session.
To take advantages of the potential opportunities
presented by low-­cost wearable EEG, a more complete
understanding of the neural processes underlying
surgical skill acquisition and performance is necessary.
The surgical education research community could benefit

greatly from more frequently integrating this measure
into the data collection process.

CONCLUSION
In this study we show that frontal theta, a putative marker of cognitive control, can differentiate
between surgical experiences. The data also indicate that frontal theta power scales with the degree
of behavioral adjustment following error commission
only for expert surgeons performing difficult tasks.
These results point towards a more nuanced interpretation of the relationship between expertise and
performance—one that may be modulated by cognitive control.
