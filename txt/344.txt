Abstract: Recently, the technology of BMI that communicates with humans and operates a robot using human brain
information has been actively studied. The authentification function using BMI has been studied by previous research.
Although many studies focus on feature extraction and learning model creation, there are few studies that discuss the
eﬀectiveness of preprocessing. In this study, we implemented an EEG biometric function using image stimulation
method. In this paper, we proposed biometric authentication system system using EEG at time of image stimulus. At
the same time, we evaluated the change in authentication accuracy in order to verify the preprocessing (digital filter,
artifact countermeasure, epoch) method in the authentication system. As a result, authentication accuracy is improved
by performing the proposed preprocessing. In addition, it was shown that convenience and security were improved
when using the system.

1. Introduction
In recent years, the technology of Brain Machine Interface
(BMI) which conducts communication, robot operation etc. using human brain activity is widely spread. The background is
that non-invasive electroencephalograph devices capable of measuring electroencephalogram (EEG) raw data in real time without embedding electrodes in the brain have been released as consumer products. Researches on BMI have been studying to support disabled and intractable patients using autonomously moving
wheelchairs [1].
However, there are few products that consider authentication
when using their BMI.
Among the widely used authentication methods, the authentication system using ID and password in the mainstream. As
another authentication method, biometric authentication system
using biometric information (fingerprint, face, etc.), has been also
increasing in recent years. Authentication using biometric information has the advantage that spoofing is more diﬃcult than conventional authentication methods using ID and password. However, biometric information such as fingerprints and faces is information that is always exposed to the outside. Therefore, it
can be stolen by a camera that records such information. This
can lead to serious counterfeit attacks against biometric authentication systems, and the publicly available biometric information
can’t be changed at its own discretion.
Biometric authentication using EEG has been proposed as a
method to cope with these problems. The EEG is internal information of the body and the possibility of being stolen is extremely
low because they can’t be measured without wearing exclusive

device. It is also known that EEG changes with external stimulus. Because of this, it is possible to change the registered data
after it is stolen.
Considering that BMI is used by intractable patients, authentication and operation can be performed by one device, when incorporating an EEG-based authentication system into BMI. Therefore, it is not necessary for intractable patients to switch devices,
and we think that this approach can reduce the burden of users.
In the research on biometrics using EEG, there are already some
research cases as shown in Chapter 2 [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8].
However, many of these studies aim to improve authentication
accuracy by feature extraction and improvement of learning models, and there are few cases which highlight the preprocessing of
measured EEG. In addition, since the measurement environment,
measurement equipment, testers, etc. diﬀer from research to another, it is impossible to compare the authentication accuracy in
general.
In this research, we aim to build an authentication system that
is used when using a BMI system and can’t be stolen from the
information. And also, we implement the biometric authentication system using EEG at the time of image stimulus presentation.
In this paper, we aim to improve the authentication accuracy by
constructing the proposed system and verifying the preprocessing
(digital filter, artifact countermeasure, epoch) method.

Performance index of biometric authentication is evaluated by
Equal Error Rate (EER). EER is the point where the false rejecThe preliminary version of this paper was published at Multimedia
Communication and Distributed Processing System Workshop (DPSWS

tion rate (FRR) and the false acceptance rate (FAR) are equal. An
example of FRR and FAR curves is shown in Fig. 1.
The horizontal axis in Fig. 1 shows is the threshold for judging
registrants and intruders, and the vertical axis shows the probability of FAR and FRR. FRR is defined as the rate of false recognition by threshold divided by the total number of matches. In this
case, a registrant is recognized as a diﬀerent person. In addition,
FAR is defined as the rate of false recognition at which another
person (intruder or another registrant) is incorrectly recognized as
a registrant by the threshold value. When the FRR is high and the
FAR is low, it is an authentication that emphasizes on security,
and when the FRR is low and the FAR is high, it is an authentication that emphasizes on convenience [9]. Therefore, it is required
to provide an authentification system which shows low EER, as
well as having high levels of both convenience and security.
In biometric authentication using EEG, there are already some
research cases. However, as mentioned above, since the condition
of measurement environment, measurement equipment, testers,
etc. are diﬀerent for each research, it is impossible to compare
the authentication accuracy in general.
Ishikawa et al.’s research classifies registrants without considering intruders. At that time, EER: 3.8% was obtained by
combining five tasks with the power spectrum of the four frequency bands of θ wave, α wave, β wave, and γ wave as feature
amounts [2].
In research by Ishikawa et al., they aim to EEG authentication
in a short time, and they are doing research on biometric authentication using brain waves at rest which not require mental tasks
or external stimulus. By using AdaBoost for the feature values
obtained from plural feature, a learning model was created, and
EER: 0.52% was obtained as having 32 registrants and 18 intruders [3].
As research for biometric authentication system using video
stimuli, Yoshikawa and colleagues divided the α wave band and
the β wave band of 30 testers who are driving a car into a plurality of regions and studied only the frequency band with good authentication rate by using machine learning. They obtained EER:
31% [4].
In the study of Touyama et al., they used auditory stimuli,
deriving personal identification accuracy using machine learning method under three conditions, such as indoor resting seating condition, outdoor resting upright condition, outdoor walking
condition. From their research, they mentioned the possibility of
brain wave personal authentication. About seven testers realized
an individual authentication accuracy rate of about 87% at indoor

resting seating [5].
In the research by Yazani et al., the k-near method was used
using the peak of the power spectral density (PSD) of the gamma
band VEP signal (GMVEP) as a feature value. They classified
20 registrants and got 100% classification accuracy when K = 14
or more [6]. In the study of Yeom et al., self-face and non-selfface images were used as stimuli. ERP (Event related potential)
was used as features when the registrant saw self-face and nonself-face. Then, 86.1% recognition accuracy was obtained for
10 registrants [7]. In their research, it is necessary to look at the
face of all registrants exhaustively, and there is a problem that the
time taken for certification increases as the number of registrants
increases. In the study of Palaniappan et al., Gamma band spectral power (GBSP) during visual stimulation was used as a feature quantity, and accuracy was improved by performing principal component analysis (PCA) and normalization as preprocessing. Using three classifiers as learning models and using PCA
recognition accuracy and up to 96.50% recognition accuracy [8].

3. Measurement Method of EEG
In this section, we describe a method for acquiring EEG using
image stimulation.
We use Emotiv Epoc+ as a device to acquire Electroencephalograph. Emotiv Epoc+ is a non-invasive device and can measure
brain activity at a sampling frequency of 128 Hz using 14 electrodes. 14 electrodes are mounted to a tester’s head according
to International 10–20 method [10]. OpenVIBE is used to obtain
EEG and to present image stimuli. OpenVIBE is a software platform that can measure EEG while presenting image stimuli in real
time.
Figure 2 shows the flow of the image displayed on the monitor
when measuring the EEG.
In our research, five cards (Heart A, Clover A, Heart J, Clover
J, Joker) are used as image stimuli. In the EEG measurement,
an image with only black background is displayed to measure
the resting EEG during the first and last 10 seconds. After that,
in order to focus on the eyes, the white circle is displayed for 3
seconds, the playing card is displayed for 2 seconds, the white
circle is displayed for 3 seconds, and the black background is displayed for 2 seconds. Repeat the flow 25 times, from the display
of the white circle to the display of the black background for 2
seconds, in order to focus on the gaze. The order of presenting
the images is random, and each kind of image must be displayed
five times. The flow shown in Fig. 2 is one trial, and the time
required for one trial measurement is about 270 seconds. As an
environment for measurement, the tester was in the indoor sitting
position, and the experiment was performed with the distance between the tester and the monitor fixed at 80 cm. Assuming use

240

Journal of Information Processing Vol.28 239–246 (Mar. 2020)

in a real environment, measurements were made in a room where
living environment sounds, without using a special environment
to prevent noise such as a shielded room.

4. Proposed Method
In this section, we describe a biometric authentication system
based on EEG analysis. We show the outline of the biometric authentication system based on EEG analysis (Fig. 3). The system
is divided into a registration phase and an authentication phase.
In the registration phase, a registration number is assigned to
each registrant, and their EEG are measured.
As the EEG are measured using non-invasive devices, the measurement contains a lot of noise as described later. Therefore,
preprocessing for noise removal is performed before feature extraction.
Feature extraction uses the similarity of time series data between the electrodes of the section looking at the image stimulus
as the feature by the cross correlation coeﬃcient (CC). By this
feature extraction, the feature for each image stimulus is used to
create a learning model. In the authentication phase, authentication is performed without knowing the certifier’s registration
number. The same preprocessing and feature extraction as performed in the registration phase are performed on the EEG data.
Classification and authentication are performed using the learning
model created in the registration phase. In the following sections,
preprocessing, feature extraction, creation of a learning model
and classification/authentication method will be described in detail.
4.1 Preprocessing
From the point of using a non-invasive devices and measuring
indoor where the living environment sound occurs, it is conceivable that the measured electroencephalogram data contains many
artifacts. Therefore, artifacts must be removed appropriately. As
we call, an artifact is all noise other than EEG. Because the EEG
is very weak, electrical potentials other than EEG are likely to
be mixed in the measurement [11]. It is necessary to remove artifacts contained in the raw data by performing preprocessing on
the measured EEG data.
Preprocessing performs the following three methods.
( 1 ) Digital filter
( 2 ) Artifact countermeasure
( 3 ) Epoch
Each method will be specifically described in the following
section.

4.1.1 Digital Filter
The digital filter lets pass only specific frequency components
and reduces other frequency components. There are roughly two
types of digital filters: FIR (Finite impulse response) filter and
IIR (Infinite impulse response) filter [12]. Impulse is a meaning
of the waveform when a filter is applied to an instantaneous voltage change. The characteristic of FIR is the meaning of the influence of the voltage change at a certain moment only spreads to a
limited time point. IIR has the eﬀect of voltage change at a certain
moment remains forever. In this study, we use least squares approximation bandpass filter for FIR filter and Butterworth bandpass filter for IIR filter. By using the band pass filter, frequency
bands other than a specific frequency band are reduced. The frequency band allowed to pass by the digital filter is 4–40 Hz. This
frequency band is a frequency band where activities of EEG are
mainly observed.
4.1.2 Artifact Countermeasure
Artifact countermeasures are performed using principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA),
and empirical mode decomposition (EMD). PCA is one of the
methods for unsupervised learning, and this obtains a linear transformation in a direction in which the variance of learning data is
maximized [13]. The feature value linearly transformed with the
eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue is called the
first principal component (λ1 ), and then the feature transformed
by the eigenvector corresponding to the k-th eigenvalue is the k-th
principal component (λk ). How much information the main component has is called the contribution ratio of the main component.
When the total number of principal components is n, the cumulative contribution rate (rk ) up to the k-th component is expressed
by Eq. (1).

rk = i=1

We use singular value decomposition as an algorithm of principal component analysis. Singular value decomposition is one of
matrix decomposition methods for matrices with complex numbers or real numbers as components. This method presents less
disadvantages than finding the covariance matrix.
ICA is a method for estimating the original signal of an independent component (IC) separated from the signal observed by
a plurality of sensors. An example of the relationship between
the original signal and the observation signal is shown in Fig. 4
(partly modified in the figure from Ref. [14]).
In Fig. 4, the observation signal is Xi (t) and the original signal is S j (t). In the observation signal, multiple original signals

241

Journal of Information Processing Vol.28 239–246 (Mar. 2020)

are attenuated by transmission decay ai j and observed in a mixed
state [14]. FastICA is applied to the ICA algorithm [15]. We
used maximization and minimization of kurtosis as the evaluation
function, and used the fixed point algorithm as the optimization.
EMD is a time-frequency analysis method for unsteady signals [16]. And it divides each frequency mixed in the measured
signal. By using EMD, the signal x(t) is separated into a plurality
of signals called Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF). Assuming that
x(t) is an input signal, the total number of signals obtained by
EMD is n, each signal obtained by EMD is ki (t), and the residual
is r(t), the following Eq. (2) can be expressed.
x(t) =

n


ki (t) + r(t)

(2)

i=1

The IMF resulting from EMD satisfies the following two requirements.
1. The number of IMF extrema (the sum of the maximum value
and the minimum value) and the number of zero crossings
are equal, at most 1 diﬀerence.
2. At any point in the signal, the average value of the envelope
(upper and lower envelopes) created from the maximum and
minimum points is zero.
We show the procedure for artifact countermeasure (Fig. 5).
The measured EEG data of 14 channels for one trial is V(t)
(t = 0–T ms). T ms is the time for one trial.
Step1. PCA is applied to V(t), and the number of principal components (k) when the cumulative contribution ratio of the
principal components exceeds 80% is N1 .
Step2. Apply ICA to V(t) and separate it into N1 ICs. ICn1 =
{ic1 , · · · , icn1 } be N1 sets of ICs separated.
Step3. Apply EMD to each component of ICn1 . Let N2 be
the number of IMFs obtained from ici (i = 1, · · · , n1 ) and
Kn2 = {k1 , · · · , kn2 } be the set of IMFs.

Step4. For each component K j ( j = 1, · · · , n2 ) of Kn2 , fast
Fourier transform is performed and divided into five frequency bands. Frequency bands are δ wave (1–3 Hz), θ wave
(4–8 Hz), α wave (9–13 Hz), β wave (14–23 Hz), γ wave
(24 Hz–). The frequency band in which EEG activity is
actively observed is mainly 4–40 Hz. Therefore, Kn2 =
{k1 , · · · , kn2 } which contains δ wave the most in a divided frequency band is eliminated as noise.
Step5. We reconstruct the set of independent components after

removal of noise (ICn1
= {ic1 , · · · , icn1 }) using the remaining
set of Kn2 .
Step6. Reconstruct as V  (t) using set ICn 1 .
4.1.3 Epoch
The epoch is to cut out image stimulation intervals for each
time window. In this research, it is used to cut out the section in
which the image stimulus is presented from the designated part
for the specified number of seconds.
4.2 Feature Extraction
The feature value is extracted from the data after preprocessing. The cross-correlation coeﬃcient (CC) between the two electrodes (a, b) is expressed by Eq. (3) [17].
N−1
k=0 ak bk
CC = 
(3)
N−1 2 N−1 2
k=0 ak

N is the data length at the time of extraction by epoch. ak ,
bk are time series data of electrodes. The cross-correlation coefficient (CC) given by Eq. (3) has a value from −1 to +1, and it
becomes a normalized correlation coeﬃcient. The combination
of all the electrodes is the feature quantity. Therefore, 91 feature
quantities are obtained. The reason why the cross-correlation coeﬃcient is used is that it is considered that the location and time at
which the EEG is activated when the same stimulus is presented

may vary depending on the person.
4.3 Learning Model Creation/Authentication Method
We applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a method for
creating a learning model, classifying and authenticating from
feature quantities obtained by feature extraction. SVM is one
of pattern recognition learning models [18]. It is often used as
a method to classify two classes basically. However, since we
need to classify multiple registrants in this research, we use it
for multi-class classification. There are two types of multi-class
classification in SVM: one-to-multi and one-to-one method. The
one-to-multi method has the advantage that the number of calculations can be reduced since the two-class classifier is trained
by the number of classes (number of registrants). However, when
the total count of one class is very high relative to the count of the
other class, the results will be biased towards the other classes.
In the one-to-one method, it is necessary to create ((C − 1)C)/2
classifiers, as the number of registrants is C, to create classifiers
for all class pairs. Although the number of classifiers increases
compared to the one-to-multi method, it has the advantage of reducing the computational cost for one classifier. In this research,
we perform multi-class classification using one-to-one method.
In the SVM, it is necessary to calculate the inner product of the
feature vectors, but by using the kernel function, it is possible
to create a model using curves without calculating inner product.
As a kernel function, we use a radial basis function (RBF: Radial
Basis Function). The RBF kernel (G) is given by the following
equation.
G(x j , xk ) = exp(−||x j − xk ||2 )

(4)

When using a learning model, the scaling process is performed
on the feature value to make the value range from 0 to +1. This
is to prevent loss of information at the time of calculation.
During SVM learning, parameters are not adjusted using hyperparameters. This is to eliminate the eﬀect of accuracy due to
SVM parameter adjustment when verifying the eﬀectiveness of
preprocessing.
In the registration phase, a learning model is created for each
type of playing card. In the authentication phase, the confidence
ratio is obtained for each registrant in the learning model by passing the feature value of the certifier. Calculation of the confidence
ratio is done using Kullback-Leibler divergence [19]. When the
maximum confidence ratio obtained in the authentication phase
is lower than the preset threshold, the authentication is refused as
an intruder. And when it is higher than the threshold, it is authenticated as the registrant who gets the maximum confidence
ratio.

5. Validation Method and Evaluation
In this section, we show the verification method of this proposed system and the evaluation result.
Authentication accuracy is determined by the EER described
in Chapter 2. Because of that, it is necessary to obtain FAR and
FRR. Based on the confidence ratio of each registrant obtained
in the authentication phase, FAR obtains the rate of accepting a
certifier who is not a correct registrant as a registrant based on

c 2020 Information Processing Society of Japan


the threshold value. Based on the reliability of each registrant obtained in the authentication phase, FRR obtains the rate at which
the authentication fails for each threshold even though the authenticator is a correct registrant.
To measure EEG, 31 male university students cooperated as
testers. When measuring the testers EEG, the flow of measurement was explained once before the measurement, and consent
was obtained for participation. We also explained the display image and the points measurement. Testers took a break for a fixed
time after one trial. The electroencephalograph was still mounted
during the break. One trial was measured three times in one day
for one tester. 31 students will be verified as 20 registrants and 11
intruders. There were 15 data for one image stimulus of playing
cards. The validation method is validated using 15 cross validations. FAR and FRR obtained from 15 were averaged to obtain
an average EER. In the following discussion, the EER value is
assumed to be average.
5.1 Verification Condition
Verification is performed by combining validation conditions
of preprocessing (Digital filter, Artifact countermeasure, Epoch).
Validation conditions are used to verify the combination at the
lowest EER. The conditions of each preprocessing are shown in
the Table 1.
The number of dimensions of the digital filter is fixed by 4dimensional, band pass filter, and the frequency band to pass is
fixed at 4–40 Hz by band pass filter. By the epoch, the length of
the image stimulation interval taken out is 1,000 ms or 2,000 ms.
The sampling frequency of the electroencephalograph is 128 Hz,
so there are 256 data points in 2,000 ms. At the time of 1,000 ms,
there are 129 positions, starting from 1 to 129 in which data points
are cut out. Therefore, there are 130 validation patterns of epochs.
5.2 Evaluation Result
At first, only the EEG data, when one card image was viewed
was used for the authentication, and it was verified to understand
the combination of the condition for the preprocessing with which
the EER was most reduced.
Fixing the condition number C2 for epoch, and checking the
condition number B1–B2 for artifact countermeasure and the condition number A1–A5 for digital filters, the results of verification
are shown in Fig. 6.
On Fig. 6, the vertical axis is EER (%), and the number of the
horizontal axis is the condition number of the digital filter. As a

result, artifact countermeasure was applied to the measured EEG,
and it was confirmed that EER was lower than the case without
EER.
The result of fixing the condition number C1 of Epoch, 1–129
the Starting point of the Epoch, the condition number B1–B2 for
artifact countermeasure, and the condition number A1–A5 of the
digital filter is shown in Fig. 7. On Fig. 7, the vertical axis is EER
(%), and the horizontal axis is the starting point of the epoch. The
graph B1 shows the condition number B1 and the graph B2 shows
the condition number B2. Each type of line graph corresponds to
the condition number of the digital filter.
Table 2 shows the minimum EER under each condition in the
graph shown in Fig. 7. In the condition number, each condition
number is entered in the order of digital filter – Artifact countermeasure – Epoch (Starting point).
The minimum EER was obtained at the time of condition A2–
B2–C1 (Starting point: 112, Starting time: 0.867 s) from the combination of all these conditions. At that time, EER was 5.602%.
Starting time is the time to start cutting. It is expressed
as Starting time [s] = (Starting point − 1)/Sampling rate.
Sampling rate is an electroencephalography sampling rate (128).
Next, we verified how EER changes when authentication was

performed using multiple card images. When using a plurality
of playing card images in the authentication phase, the credibility
rates of each registrant obtained from the learning model of each
playing card are added together, averaged and classified and authenticated. At that time, the minimum EER obtained is shown in
Table 3 for each number of cards and their combination. In the
condition number, each condition number is entered in the order
of digital filter – Artifact countermeasure - Epoch (Starting point:
Starting time [s]).
Table 3 shows that EER decreases by increasing the number of
image stimuli. In authentication, it is thought that it is more effective as an authentication method to use electroencephalogram
data that saw multiple image stimuli than viewing a single image
stimulus. However, when using multiple image stimuli, there is
a tradeoﬀ that the time required for authentication increases because the time during which the user is viewing the image stimulation increases. Also, when the number of image stimuli during authentication is 1 and 2, the artifact countermeasure showed
the minimum EER. However, when it is more than 3, the result
shows the smallest EER without performing digital filter and artifact measures.
The graph of FAR and FRR verified with 1 image and 5 image
conditions is shown in Fig. 8.
The graphs (a) and (b) are the condition numbers A2–B2–C1
(112). (a) is when the number of image stimuli used for authentication is one, and (b) is when the number of image stimuli is
five. Similarly, the graphs of (c) and (d) are condition numbers
A1–B1–C1 (34). (c) is when the number of image stimuli used
for authentication is one, and (d) is when the number of image
stimuli is five.
Graph (a) had an EER of 5.602%, while graph (c) had an EER
of 8.002%.
Looking at the graphs of (a) and (c) shown in Fig. 8, the FAR is
almost the same, whereas the FRR of (a) is lower than (c). It can
be seen that the FRR rapidly increases near the threshold value
of 95%. Graph (b) was EER: 2.000%, while graph (d) was EER:
0.944%. The details of FRR for each threshold in graph (b), (d)

It can be confirmed that the value of (d) is lower than that of
(b) at threshold value: 30%. This is considered that the reliability of the correct registrant has dropped locally due to the digital
filter and the countermeasure against the artifact. However, it can
be seen from Table 4 that the FRRs of (b) are all lower than the
FRRs of (d) when the threshold is 40% or more. From this, it was
suggested that applying artifact countermeasure and digital filters
as preprocessing is eﬀective to improve user’s convenience.

Verification and Result of Authentication Accuracy by
Changing the Dimensionality of Digital Filter
Next, we verified the authentication accuracy when the dimensionality of the digital filter is changed.
Let B2–C1 (112) be the fixed verification condition. By changing the dimensionality in A2 to A5 of the conditions of the digital
filter shown in Table 1 to 1–10 dimensions, it is verified which
condition is optimal when performing the digital filter. The frequency band to pass in the digital filter is fixed at 4–40 Hz. The
evaluation is EER when the number of image stimuli is one. The
verification results are shown in Fig. 9.
According to Fig. 9, changing the dimensionality of the digital
filter resulted in the minimum EER (5.19%) when A2 (one trial
IIR filter) was executed in three dimensions.
5.4

Verification and Result of Accuracy by Combination of
Registrants
We verified the authentication accuracy when the combination
a registrant and an intruder is changed. We choose 1,000 of all the
patterns of a registrant and an intruder at random, and then tested.
Verification conditions were A2–B2–C1 (112). The dimensionality of the digital filter was three-dimensional. A1–B1–C2 in the
combination of the same registrant and intruder was compared.
The eﬀectiveness of preprocessing is verified using average FRR
and average EER, which are averages of 1,000 verification results

for a single image stimulus used for authentication, as evaluation
values. The average FRR and average EER for each threshold
value in verification and the average reduction rate are shown in
Table 5.
From Table 5, it was confirmed that both FRR and EER decreased by preprocessing. The average decreasing rate of EER
is 3.57%, but the average decreasing rate is 38.58% when the
threshold is 90% for FRR. This indicates that the convenience
and security of the user is improved compared to the time when
the preprocessing is not applied. Moreover, the combination of
registrants was changed, and when the condition of pretreatment
was A2–B2–C1 (112), it showed average EER: 5.87%, minimum
EER: 5.00% maximum EER: 6.96% standard deviation: 0.275,
Dispersion: 0.076. From this, we think that the influence on the
change of the value of EER by registrant is small.

6. Conclusion
In this paper, we examined and evaluated the preprocessing
method for personal identification in EEG. Among the proposed
methods, combinations of preprocessing, authentication using
multiple image stimuli, the number of dimensions of digital filters, and changes in authentication accuracy for combinations of
registrants were verified. As a result, the minimum EER was
obtained when the data after 0.867 s (Starting point: 112) from
the image stimulus presentation was cut out for 1,000 ms by artifact countermeasure, digital filter (Three-dimensional IIR filter
for a single trial) and epoch as preprocessing when performing
authentication. We examined the influence of authentication accuracy by the combination of a registrant and an intruder, and it is
considered that the influence on the change of EER value by registrant is small. In addition, the average decreasing rate of EER
by preprocessing was 3.57%, and the average decreasing rate of
FRR was 38.58% when the threshold was 90%. These results
suggest that preprocessing improves the accuracy of authentication and improves the convenience of the user. As future work,
this paper uses EEG data of one tester without separating the data
for the registration and authentication, and the tester didn’t take
oﬀ the electroencephalograph in a experiment day. Therefore, it
is considered to be necessary to separate measurement for the authentication and the registration for authentication, and to verify
whether authentication of EEG is possible even after one week.
Next, in this research, the tester’s condition was indoor rest sitting

position authentication. It is necessary to create a learning model
in sitting position state at the time of registration, and to verify
whether authentication can be performed even if EEG measured
in a state other than sitting position state in the authentication
phase. Furthermore, although the image of playing cards was
used for image stimulation this time, we will investigate what
kind of changes occur in the reactions of the EEG by using other
image stimuli. It is also necessary to verify if any individual differences can be made depending on the types of image stimulus.

to readers in this research field and thus is selected as a recommended paper.
