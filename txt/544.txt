Abstract—This study investigates the capability of electroencephalogram
(EEG) signals to be used for biometric identification. In the context of biometric, recently, researchers have been focusing more on biomedical signals to
substitute the biometric modalities that are being used nowadays as the signals
obtained from our bodies is considered more secure and privacy-compliant. The
EEG signals of 6 subjects were collected where the subjects were required to
undergo two baseline experiments which are, eyes open (EO) and eyes closed
(EC). The signals were processed using a 2nd order Butterworth filter to eliminate the unwanted noise in the signals. Then, Daubechies (db8) wavelet was applied to the signals in the feature extraction stage and from there, Power Spectral Density (PSD) of alpha and beta waves was computed. Finally, the correlation model and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) was applied
to classify the EEG signals of each subject. Correlation model has yielded great
significant difference of coefficient between autocorrelation and crosscorrelation where it gives the coefficient value of 1 for autocorrelation and the
coefficient value of less than 0.35 for cross-correlation. On the other hand, the
MLPNN model gives an accuracy of 75.8% and 71.5% for classification during
EO and EC baseline condition respectively. Therefore, these results support the
usability of EEG signals in biometric recognition.

Introduction

Biometrics is means to recognize individuals based on the high basis of one or
more physical or behavioural criteria’s such as fingerprint, retinal pattern and DNA
[1]. The biometric system is fundamentally a pattern recognition system that operates
constructed on three main stages which are enrollment stage - acquiring an individual’s biometric data, excerpting a feature set from the secured data and matching the
feature set with the template set in the gallery. This offers a substitute to username
and password as well as smart cards [1]. Therefore, biometric systems have been
widely deployed in wide-ranging areas such as in criminal investigation, health care

screening, commercial and government applications. For instance, fingerprint, signature, gait and iris as shown in Figure 1 are amongst the several biometric modalities
that have been suggested for the past few years. Nevertheless, not all biometrics do
not offer satisfactory recognition rates [1]. Fingerprints, for example, can be faked or
can be obtained by force whereas the most unique biometric which is deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is easily contaminated and not really accepted by the society since it
can gives information about susceptibilities of a person to certain diseases. Besides
that, some individual may not possess these biometric attributes due to mishap or
disabilities. Hence, the use of EEG signals in biometric recognition has spark interest
of researchers in this area because of the ability to give excellent results as this signal
is much closer to human brain which controls our actions and reactions.

Fig. 1. Different types of biometric modalities

EEG is defined as an alternating type electrical activity which was obtained by the
metal electrodes assigned on human’s scalp [2]. Like other biometric attributes, EEG
signals also provide related information concerning individual dissimilarities related
to brain anatomical and functional traits [3]. Due to distinctness of each brain configurations, it is presumed that each individual has their own brain patterns. This signal is
considered more safe and privacy-compliant than traditional biometric identifiers.
Furthermore, EEG based biometric systems offer open access to everyone including
people with certain physical abilities such as missing fingers or absence of the iris.
Therefore, the purpose of this study is to propose an EEG based biometric recognition
system and to assess the performance of the proposed system.

Literature Review

Palaniappan [4] presented a two-stage biometric recognition method which utilizes
the EEG signals generated by mental activities of five subjects. The signals were
gathered by Keirn and Aunon. These activities composed of baseline or also known as
resting state, mathematical calculation, geometric figure rotation, letter composing
and visual counting. For each mental task, ten experiments were conducted in separate
sessions for each subject, where each experiment lasted for about ten seconds. The

78

Paper—EEG Based Biometric Identification Using Correlation and MLPNN Models

EEG signal produced by each and every activity was divided into 20 segments of 0.5
second to acquire a greater dataset. Next, AR modeling was used to extract features
from the data and the author used Burg’s method to determine the AR coefficient. The
results of the experiment show that all subjects gave optimum outcome in rejecting
imposters which means that the False Acceptance Error (FAE) is zero for each mental
activity whereas for the False Rejection Error (FRE), the fifth subject gave 1.5% and
0.75% for baseline and mathematical calculation while the first subject gave 1.0% for
letter composing activity. Visual counting and geometric figure rotation were concluded to be the best mental activities because of the fact that the FAE and FRE values for these two activities are zero. However, this method is considered cumbersome
and inconvenient for everyone since visual stimulus is a must for this approach.
Brigham and Kumar [5] claimed that a person can be identified from EEG signals
that were obtained during imagined speech. The authors used imagined speech EEG
data collected from six volunteers at University of California, Irvine (UCI). These
volunteers were required to imagine pronouncing one of the two syllables which are
/ba/ or /ku/, at varying rhythms covertly while their EEG signals were being computed. The rhythms of the syllables are heard to subjects beforehand through a set of
electrostatic earphones. Several assumptions were then made in addition to the applied AR model to the EEG signals. This was done to determine the power spectral
density of the signal before SVM classifier was used for the classification of volunteers. The linear SVM classifier gives the most accurate identification result with an
average classification rate of 99.41% for the imagined speech dataset. Besides that,
the classification process was also done on each rhythm as well as each syllable individually. Although the identification accuracies for rhythms and syllables are slightly
smaller than that of imagined speech dataset, these outcomes suggest that the proposed method is suitable for biometric identification. However, these imagined speech
characteristics could fluctuate in every experiment which results in uncertainty of
information for any kind of classification.
Kostilek and St’astny [6] suggested that the use of movement-related EEG provides better identification results for biometric recognition. The EEG database of nine
subjects was collected from two sessions, each spaced one year apart. During each
session, subject was requested to perform voluntary movements such as right or left
index finger extension or flexion while keeping his eyes closed. For each subject and
session, four blocks of EEG were obtained where three blocks comprising of the mentioned movements and the fourth block carries only resting EEG. The first block is
expected to have some noise due to the restlessness of subject in the beginning of the
session. A total of eight neighbors Laplacian vector is used to filter all EEG signals
before Frequency-Zooming Auto-Regression (FZ-AR) were applied to obtain classification features which were the µ rhythm parameters. Different combinations of blocks
from both sessions were used to test whether the presence of additional noise in one of
the EEG database blocks degrades the classification results. The outcome of the Mahalanobis distance classifier shows that the combination of the second and the third
block gives the highest classification score of 87.1% whereas the other combinations
give almost similar result of approximately 77% in average. Despite the proven state-

ment that the movement-related EEG helps in identifying the subjects, the author
believed that the use of β rhythm gives better results for this method.
Thomas and Vinod [7] found that beta band entropy conveys most of the particular
information related to subjects during resting state. The authors conducted experiments using EEG signals of 109 healthy subjects which were collected from a publicly available online database called PhysioNet BCI. Two different baseline conditions
which are one-minute EC and one-minute EO were used as the dataset. The study
used two operating phases: enrolment and identification for the recognition system.
During enrolment, sample entropy based features were obtained from five sub-bands
of EEG known as delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-30 Hz) and
gamma (30-50 Hz) to generate template and were stored in the database. Based on
Mahalanobis distance based classifier, subject identification was carried out by extracting sample entropy features from multi-band decomposed multi-channel EEG
data. The average correct recognition rate (CRR) which is the performance index used
for the proposed recognition system shows that, in both EO and EC, beta band gave
better identification level than the other four bands where it provides an average CRR
of 98.31% in the validation procedure. However, this approach does not give an optimum recognition performance since it uses higher number of EEG channels.
Harshit et al. [8] proposed an online based EEG biometric recognition system that
uses both visual and audio stimuli for five subjects. All subjects are right-handed and
free from any serious medical conditions. Offline experiment is first conducted to
determine the correlation threshold of various stimuli (self, familiar and unfamiliar)
for both cases. The visual session is conducted for 10 seconds for each single trial
which consist of 10 self-face images, 10 familiar faces images and 10 unfamiliar faces
images in random order. For the audio session, subjects were required to hear self,
familiar and unfamiliar voices from the same phrase for eight trials in each stimulus.
Based on experimental results, it is observed that the amplitude of EEG signal in response to self-face stimuli is higher as compared to familiar and unfamiliar faces for
all subjects. On the other hand, the amplitude of EEG signal in response to self-voice
is lower than familiar voice and higher than unfamiliar voice. EEG signals are then
recorded during online experiment and the feature vectors consist of Power Spectral
Density (PSD) values were compared with the template obtained from the offline
experiment. The false acceptance rate (FAR) and false rejection rate (FRR) were then
computed which gives the average FAR of 13.91% and average FRR of 26.66% while
the recognition accuracy was recorded to be 79.73%. Even though the results obtained
were quite satisfying, the proposed approach needs to be tested in a greater population
over an extended duration. Furthermore, this approach is not applicable for people
with disabilities such as blind and deaf.
Bashar et al. [9] have come up with an advanced machine learning technique for
EEG based human identification. The EEG signals of nine female adults were acquired using a five channel EEG device known as Emotiv Insight in few recording
sessions. For each session, subjects were asked to execute two baseline tasks which
were EC and EO for one minute with a sampling frequency of 1280 Hz. The signals
were first filtered using a FIR bandpass filter to remove the unwanted noise. Then,
three methods of feature extraction which are multiscale shape description (MSD),

80

http://www.i-joe.org

Paper—EEG Based Biometric Identification Using Correlation and MLPNN Models

multiscale wavelet packet statistics (WPS) and multiscale wavelet packet energy statistics (WPES) were applied to the signals. Lastly, the SVM classifier with the applied
error-correcting output code multiclass model (ECOC) was used for the classification
process. In this study, only the results obtained from EC task were presented and
based on the experimentation, the WPS and WPES methods performed better identification as compared to the MSD method. These two methods gave the highest accuracy of 94.44% on channel-3 and channel-5 for WPS and on channel-5 for WPES. Despite the satisfying results produced by WPS and WPES methods, it is believed that
there are other potential methods that could give better results which were not analyzed in this study.

Methodology

The general design of the proposed system starts with EEG signals collection and
followed by pre-processing of the signals. Next, alpha and beta sub-bands were extracted using the proposed feature extraction technique and from there, PSD of the
two sub-bands were computed. Finally, classification of the signals were performed
using correlation and MLPNN models. Figure 2 encapsulates the overall architecture
of the proposed system. The next sub-sections will briefly describe about each steps
of the proposed system.

Fig. 2. Overall design of the proposed system

3.1

Data acquisition

In this study, the EEG signals were acquired from an EEG electrode cap which was
connected to a BrainMarker EXG system. The EEG system was then connected to a
laptop for data recording as shown in Figure 3. Datasets of six subjects that were
required to undergo two baseline experiments which are EO and EC were collected.
Each experiment was performed for a duration of 60 seconds for each subject. During
EO condition, subjects were instructed to minimize eye blinking to reduce noise and
artifacts in the signals. The EEG signals of each subject were recorded for one minute
at a sampling frequency of 15000 Hz in each condition using a 19-channel electrode
cap. The raw signals were then pre-processed using 2nd order Butterworth filter with a
band pass of 0.01 to remove noise in the signals.

3.2

Feature extraction

In order to characterize the EEG signals into five sub-bands as mentioned earlier,
db8 wavelet function was applied to the filtered signals. The db8 wavelet decomposes
EEG signals into multi-level details with respect to the range of frequencies of each
sub-band [10]. Additionally, only signals obtained from electrodes C3, C4 and CZ
will be used in this study. This is because, previous works done by neurologists show
that, EEG recordings from these three electrodes consist of particularly any brain
activities related to imaginary motor movement including movement of the eyes [11].
Besides that, these three electrodes contain two sub-bands which coincide with the
brain activity of a normal adult during conscious state that are alpha and beta waves.
Thus, EEG signals from the remaining 16 electrodes as well as delta, theta and gamma waves will not be further analyzed in this study because the main focus is to analyzed signals containing alpha and beta waves.
Subsequently, the PSD of alpha and beta waves were computed using Welch’s
method or also known as periodogram averaging method. Equation 1 depicts the
equation of periodogram values to obtain Welch’s estimate of the PSD.
'

𝑆" (𝑣) = ( ∑(+,' 𝑃+ (𝑣)

(1)

where the parameter S refers to the number of points to shift between segments, parameter K defines the number of segments or batches and parameter P is the modified
periodogram value [12].
3.3

Classification

In this final step, two different methods were used to classify EEG signals of six
subjects which are correlation model and MLPNN model. These two methods are
briefly discussed in the next sub-sections.

3.4

Correlation model

Correlation is a method where two signals are required to produce a third signal. If
a signal is associated with itself, the third signal is called the autocorrelation, otherwise it is called the cross correlation of the two input signals. Equation 2 shows the
cross correlation function used in this classification step
𝐶(𝑛, τ) = ∑6 x(t)y(n, t + τ)

(2)

Where x(t) and y(t) denote the PSD of the first and second set of EEG signals at
time t and channel n, respectively. Moreover, τ denotes the time lag between the two
signals [8].
The association of two variables is stronger as the coefficient value approaching to
± 1. On the other hand, a correlation coefficient of 0 signifies that there is no association exists between the measured variables. The correlation coefficients are categorized into three categories for both positive and negative correlations which are low or
weak correlation (≤ 0.35), moderate correlation (0.36 – 0.67) and high or strong correlation (0.68 – 1.0) [9].
3.5

MLPNN model

MLPNN is one of the types of neural networks with error based training mechanism used to classify EEG signals. The multilayer perceptron composes of a system of
simple interrelated neurons or nodes. Figure 4 illustrates the architecture of a threelayer MLPNN used for EEG classification. In this study, the multilayer perceptron
requires six output nodes where one node is representing one subject. That being said,
six binary vectors were assigned as the target output vector where bit 1 indicates the
correct classification and bit 0 specifies the incorrect classification.

Experimentation and Results

In this study, a total of six subjects were required to undergo two baseline conditions which are EO and EC. Subjects were placed in a dim light room and they were
asked to be in a calm condition before the recording process started. During EO condition, subjects were instructed to minimize eye blinking to reduce noise and artifacts
in the signals. The EEG signals of each subject were recorded for one minute in each
condition using a 19-channel electrode cap and the signals obtained were displayed
through a laptop as shown in Figure 5.

Fig. 5. Recorded EEG signals

The raw signals were then pre-processed using 2nd order Butterworth filter with a
band pass of 0.01 to remove noise in the signals. After that, the filtered signals from
electrodes C3, C4 and CZ were further analyzed to discriminate alpha and beta waves
of each subject where the PSD for these two waves were computed afterwards. For
illustration purposes, only the EEG signals from electrode C3 of three subjects are
shown which are categorized into EO and EC.
The PSD of alpha and beta waves during EO baseline condition are depicted in
Figure 6 for Subject 1, in Figure 7 for Subject 2 and in Figure 8 for Subject 3. As for
EC baseline condition, the PSD of alpha and beta waves are demonstrated in Figure 9
for Subject 1, in Figure 10 for Subject 2 and in Figure 11 for Subject 3.

Finally, correlation model was applied to the extracted features as the first classification method. For documentation purpose, only correlation coefficient values from
electrode C3 are depicted which are categorized into EO and EC. The correlation
coefficients of PSD values for electrode C3 during EO baseline condition are provided in Table 1 for alpha wave and Table 2 for beta wave. As for EC baseline condition,

As for the MLPNN model, the performance of the system was measured by the total percentage of correct and incorrect classification as shown in Table 5.
Table 5. Percentage of correct and incorrect classification of MLPNN system
Baseline condition
EO
EC

Percentage of correct classification
75.8%
71.5%

Percentage of incorrect classification
24.2%
28.5%

Based on the correlation coefficients tabulated in Tables 1 to 4, it is deduced that
for signals correlated with their own signals, the coefficient value is 1 for all six subjects. Whereas, for signals that correlated with other subjects’ signals, the coefficients
obtained are less than 0.35 which falls under the category of weak correlation. These
indicate that correlation method is capable of classifying the EEG signals of different
subjects with a significant difference between autocorrelation and cross correlation.
Meanwhile, based on the result in Table 4.5, it shows that MLPNN has the ability
to match the EEG signals of individuals in this experiment. However, the percentage
of incorrect classification for both conditions is probably due to the utilization of EEG
electrode cap to record the EEG signals in this experiment. This is because, the position of electrodes on subjects’ scalps does not exactly match the 10-20 system international standard of electrode location for EEG signal recording as humans have different sizes of head. Besides that, the algorithm used during feature extraction might be
unsuitable and could also contribute to the percentage of incorrect classification.
To summarize, both correlation and MLPNN models have the potential to classify
EEG signals of every individuals. However, both methods have several limitations.
For the first classification method, even though correlation model yields a very significant difference of coefficient between autocorrelation and cross correlation, it cannot
give an exact value of the method’s accuracy as this method only measures the degree
to which two signals are correlated. As for the MLPNN model, despite its capability
to impart the correct and incorrect classification percentage, the percentage for correct
classification is not very satisfying.

Conclusion

To sum up, this study has demonstrated the potentiality of EEG signals to be used
for biometric identification. All four steps of the proposed methodology which are
data acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction and classification have been concluded. Based on the experimentation outcomes, correlation model has yielded great
significant difference of coefficient between autocorrelation and cross correlation
where it gives coefficient value of 1 for autocorrelation and coefficient value of less
than 0.35 for cross correlation. Meanwhile, the MLPNN model gives an accuracy of
75.8% and 71.5% for classification during EO and EC baseline condition respectively.
Thus, the objectives of this study which are to study the concept of EEG signal and
biometric system, to develop an EEG based biometric identification mechanism and
to evaluate the performance of the proposed system have been achieved.
