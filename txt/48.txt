effective Cloud storage that can tide over the turbulent conditions of the rapidly budding digital storage technologies. This
send an outcry for a devoted solution, in the form of an individualized, patient-centric care - IoMT that augments precise
disease identifications, decrease in errors, reduction in costs of care through the support of technology, allows patients to
direct health information data to doctors ,manage drugs, keep Personal Health Records, caters to remote medical supports
Care, provides proactive approach to preserving Good Health, improves and Accelerates Clinician Workflows, empowers
extreme connectivity due to better automation and perceptions in the DNA of IoMT functions. But IoMT adoption is like a
rose with thorns like constraints of increased administrative costs, deficiency of universal data access, present-day electronic
medical records. The BCT is used in the framework to overcome the security issues of IoMT through the use of latest
encryptions. Furthermore, this framework harnesses the benefits of Block Chain like reduced cost, speed, automation,
immutability, near-impossible loss of data, permanence, removal of intermediaries, decentralization of consensus, legitimate
access to health data, data safekeeping, accrual-based imbursement mechanisms, and medical supply chain efficacy. The

I. HEALTH CARE ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES –
AN INTRODUCTION

b.

Technology is unavoidable, irresistible as gravity and
inexorable as moving water. The same holds true for all the
enabling (disruptive) technologies in the Health Care.
Health Care is the conservation or enrichment of welfare
through the deterrence, detecting, treatment, regaining, or
recovering from ailment, disorder, damage, and other
physical and mental damages in individuals. The
regulatory, standards and guidelines are still in the initial
stages and this do not fully guarantee against the data
security and privacy of the Health Care steeplechases to the
implementation of the enabling technologies.

c.

A. RATIONALE

Recent 2020 report given by the World Bank and
WHO, states that approximately half of the world
population can’t afford or even access to elementary
Health Care services. The report further expresses the
prevalent incongruity in the availability and affordability of
Health Care services even in the industrialized world. The
utilization of computers in Health Care has led to the
computerization of Health Care record system; dispersal of
reliable information; inspection in Big Data; and alliance in
clinical practice and diagnosis [3],[76]. But even then, it is
not a perfect one-point solution.
To combat with the prevalent challenges, we have to erect
the real-time remote Health Care one-to-one care structure,
on the four pillars of enabling technologies, namely, Block
Chain (BC), Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), Cloud
Computing (CC)and Big Data Analytics (BDA). The
confluence of the above enabling technologies minimizes
not only the cost, disbursed on surgery and medicines, but
also reduces the number of visits to the hospitals by the
patients. This aids even the uninsured patients to receive
good cost-effective Health Care services. The scope of this
paper is about the integration of the two technologies and
the related research on Block Chain based IoMT Cloud
smart Health Care solutions.
B. CONTRIBUTIONS

Many research studies have accredited the utilization,
efficacy of Block Chain and IoMT in the Health Care
Ecosystem in delivering a one-to-one care solution.
Nevertheless, none of the works in the literature have
focused on the Fusion of Block Chain technology, Internet
of Medical Things, Cloud Storage to arrive at an
impeccable Patient Centric Health Care. Obviously, the
proposed Layered Architecture is anticipated to slender
down the clefts in the research slits and the key take-away
given in this paper are condensed as the following five
facades:
a. A systematic scrutiny of the current IoMT, Block
Chain and Cloud Storage in Health Care.

Medical Things (IoMT), Cloud Computing (CC).
Formulate the requirements necessary for the realtime remote Health Care of one-to-one care
structure, which, supports the vital functions that
are critical to the Patient Centric Health Care.
Design and develop a novel BC IoMT U6 HCS
(Block Chain based Internet of Medical Things for
Uninterrupted,
Ubiquitous,
User-friendly,
Unflappable, Unblemished, Unlimited Health Care
Services) Layered Architecture, to support the
vital functions critical for Patient Centric Health
Care.
Implement and test with the previous established
and proven techniques. The integrity of the
Layered Architecture is validated with the already
existing ones in terms of audit performances. The
results from the Layered Architecture are validated
and are proven to be competent in achieving safe
auditing and surpass the former ones.

the IoT Health Care market is expected to spread up to
$136.8 billion worldwide. Moreover, the vision of medical
services at ‘anytime, anywhere and anything’ is also
altering the patient expectations and this inspires the next

FIGURE 1. Worldwide Internet Of Medical Things(IoMT) Market, 20162026,US$ Mn
Source:https://www.alltheresearch.com/report/166/internet-of-medical-thingsmarket

Based on an analysis given by Frost & Sullivan, the world
IoMT market in 2016 is worth $22.5 billion; and it is
predicted to reach $72.02 billion by 2021, at a compound
yearly
growth
rate
of
26.2%.
Additionally,
AllTheResearch , projects(see figure .1) that the IoMT
market is expected to reach 254.2 billion USD by 2026.
AllTheResearch further states that, “This is a massive
increase from 44.5 billion USD predicted in 2018. The
increased adoption of sensor technology and smart devices
comes from the change in consumer lifestyle as trends like
health and fitness are on the rise”.
A.IoMT/ H-IoT - A QUICK REVIEW

The IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) is the unification of
data from various medical gadgets (equipped with sensors)
and software applications in the Health Care systems
wirelessly. The IoMT collects remote patient health data
from the wearable sensors; pre-processes the collected data,
streams it to the Health Care Professionals via machine-tomachine (M to M) fortified with Wi-Fi. The Health Care
data is stockpiled in the Cloud server for additional
analysis. This data unification results in improved patient
outcomes by combining the people, data and processes
through connected medical devices and mobile
applications. The IoMT thus increases the efficacy of
Health Care devices, and the speed and accessibility of
Health Care services.
IoMT - TechTarget which gives the
technology professionals and executives the information
they need defines Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) as,
“The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is the collection of
medical devices and applications that connect to Health
Care IT systems through online computer networks.
Medical devices equipped with Wi-Fi allow the machine-tomachine communication that is the basis of IoMT. IoMT
devices link to Cloud platforms such as Amazon Web
DEFINITION-

Services, on which captured data can be stored and
analysed. IoMT is also known as Health Care IoT.”
B.MOTIVES FOR IoMT ACCEPTANCE

Gus Vlahos [33] lists the rationale for IoMT adoption:
 IoMT improves and accelerates the clinician
workflows. For example, Memorial Hermann
Health System in Texas Tools uses IoMT to send
SMS, scan barcodes, and to transmit images.
 IoMT empowers good connectivity due to Better
automation and perceptions in the genetical
makeup of the functions of IoMT. For example,
the “smart pills, are used to send alerts and deliver
messages to the concerned doctor’s smartphone.
 IoMT aids in remote medical support and care
– IoMT assists in remote patient monitoring, by
collecting data and sending it to analysts
(providers); who will estimate the long-term
metrics to rapidly envisage the onset of critical
illness very much ahead distress. For example,
Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) in various
hospital’s across Europe like UCLA Health and
Children’s Health in Dallas have succeeded in
minimising the readmissions.
 IoMT helps to proactively conserve Good
Health – The increase in the usage of consumer
wearables to accumulate and send the health data
to care takers and medical personnel. Treatment is
useful to proactively handle Health Care. For
example, Apple Watch 6 (keep well, save lives by
forewarning the onset of heart problems) has a
new sensor to alert blood oxygen levels; Google’s
Verily (clinical trial), Amazon (PillPack and
online symptom-checker Health Navigator),
Microsoft’s Healthcare NExT (AI in health care).
C.ROLE OF IoMT IN HEALTH CARE

The IoMT supports in reduction in costs of Health Care
through the support of technology, precise identification of
diseases, minimisation of errors, and allowing patients to
directly communicate health information data to doctors.
This is particularly important in current COVID-19 crisis;
because, the IoMT does not need in-person medical
visits. AllTheResearch gives an implication that the global
pandemic of COVID-19 has only further accelerated the
need for IoMT and is playing a huge role in the growth of
the technology. IoMT comes as a handy technology to the
medical industry researchers, who, are in search of the most
efficient screening process and quick monitoring of patient
symptoms. AllTheResearch likewise, states, that
technologies, such as, IoT in 5G, Cloud Computing and
Block Chain powered alongside Artificial Intelligence will
definitely make for a massive competent Health-Tech
Ecosystem.
D. IoMT/ H-IoT - HEALTH CARE APPLICATIONS

patient one-to-one care for chronic disease, smart pills and
cybernetic consultations.
TechTarget lists a few examples of IoMT technology as
follows:
 Infusion pumps are connected to the analytical
consoles and sanatorium beds (armed with
sensors) help to quantity the patient’s dynamic
signs;
 patient’s habiliment mobile gadgets, send
information to caregivers;
 distant patient intensive care of people with
unending or lasting conditions; and
 trailing patient medication orders along with the
geo-position of patients.

Deloitte [15], highlights the prospects for lessening the
costs with usage of IoMT, improve drug administration,
diagnosis, treatment, augment patient involvement and
permit distant 24-hour care of chronic diseases, paving way
to upgraded patient consequences. Lindman and Saarikko
[58], narrate the augmentation of allied Health Care
solutions and how to offer security by alerting Health Care
specialists when a patient desires assistance. In short,
IoMT shows a promising prospect of offering a better
quality Health Care at a lower cost [52], which finally ends
up in lengthier lives [31].
F. ORDEALS OF IoMT

FIGURE 2. High Level Diagram of Internet of Medical Things

Figure 2. depicts the High-Level Diagram of Internet of
Medical Things. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT),
has four levels, namely, sensor level, personal server level,
operational computer networks (WWW) level and
Therapeutic server level. The data is collected from the
patients via sensors, tags, from medical gadgets from
applications, harbored at the personal server level. This is
linked to the Health Care IT systems (Therapeutic server
level) through operational computer networks (WWW).
The Medical devices armed with wireless connectivity
permit the machine-to-machine communication; the devices
in turn are connected to Cloud platforms, on which the
captured data is stored and analyzed.
E. PROSPECTS WITH INTERNET OF MEDICAL THINGS

Farahani, et al., [23], states, that, IoMT provides a holistic
solution by amalgamating different technologies in perfect
symphony and it renders user-based personalization of the
content or service; which, leads to reduction the costs of
Health Care, offering the availability and accessibility, as it
can be used at any time and any location.
Gulraiz, et al., [31], states, that IoMT improves the pricing
reasonably, facility and uncomplicatedness in use of
devices, and enhancing the efficiency. Besides, the doctors
can concentrate on the real-time health status of patient and
can monitor a greater number of patients.
Irfan & Ahmad,et al., [52], mention that with IoMT,
patients can be pragmatic during their aera , and get a
whole long-term picturing of their Health Care data.



IoMT, deals with enormous amount(volume), of
heterogenous Health Care data(variety), generated
continuously(velocity); which, mandate’s the
necessity to devise special techniques to tackle the
big Health Care data.
High cost is incurred on patients (for linking to
fitness smart devices, remote patient monitoring
systems), and Medical care takers (integrating of
medical equipment into the current Health Care
ecosystem).
Health Care data includes extremely sensitive data
like patient’s ailment information, treatment details
and their geolocations. This necessitates for devising
strong privacy protection mechanisms.
IoMT implementation brings to the forefront issues
like security perils (linked to the movement and
network necessities), vague passwords and less
frequent (if any) mending upgrades. This calls for an
outcry of a comprehensive endpoint protection
strategies like Strong Security, and data Integrity
Measures. There are also issues that are linked with
sustaining the growth of the IoT environment like,
transparency, trust and longevity to be handled.

Taking into account the above challenges, we have to
double our intensive effort in devising comprehensive
protection strategies and robust network monitoring; which
necessitates the inclusion of Block Chain technology. Let
us see how we can rope Block Chain for use in IoMT.
III. BLOCK CHAIN

Block Chain picks up where IoMT & Cloud technology
bites the dust. BC is used to store information securely in
safe locations for future information sharing. A Block
Chain is a ledger which is dispersed and it operates based
on consensus alias validation mechanisms programmed on
dissimilar nodes of its networks. The Block Chain is used to
generate a tamper-proof digital ledger of transactions;
which is shared among the parties. The transactions among
the parties are signed using public-key cryptography and
these dealings are stockpiled on a circulated ledger. The
ledger is encompassed of cryptographically linked blocks of
transactions, to form a block chain. Once recorded it is very

difficult to remove a block from the Block Chain ledger.
Block Chain thus gives a digital version of etching
information into solid stone. Block Chain technology
further permits dispersed preservation of encrypted data.
A. TYPES OF BLOCK CHAIN

There are many, types of Block Chain (see Table 1), that
have emerged such as public, private, semi-private, sidechains etc.

B. BLOCK CHAIN IN HEALTH CARE

A vast body of literature is available that converses the use
of Block Chain in Health Care. The year 2015, witnessed
the popularization of Block Chain as a novel economic
model [85] and the use of Block Chain for decentralizing
privacy [97].

The year 2016, saw the evolution of Block Chain [5],
Electronic Patient Record systems (EPRs) [6], and its
utilization in empowering the patient-physician relationship
[6]. Azaria, A, et al., [3] in their paper described about the
utilization of Block Chain for handling authorization in
medical domain, with a developed application named as
Medrec. Some authors cited the use of Block Chain as
solutions for Interoperability [9].
In the year 2017, Block Chain evolved rapidly [14]; and it
was used in various Health Care applications [2],[7],[16].
The Block Chain is substantiated to be very energetic for
Health Care [34], consequently vesting e-health [18]. Many
preceding works mentions about the challenges and
opportunities of Block Chain in e-Health Care [77], [56].
Esposito, C, et al., [22] showed how in 2018, Block Chain
gained its celebrity status as an assurance for offering
security and privacy of eHealth Care. Example To name a
few systems - Blochie [55], FHIRchain [92] and Mistore
[96].
Other works that is of interest are : AuthPrivacyChain
(blockchain-based access control framework with privacy
protection) proposed by Caixia Yang, et al., [10];
blockchain-empowered AAA scheme for accessing data of
LS-HetNet proposed by Na Shi, et al., [70] and zkCrowd
(an innovative hybrid blockchain crowdsourcing platform)
named and proposed by, Saide Zhu et al.,[80].
C.REASONS FOR PREFERRING BLOCK CHAIN IN
HEALTH CARE

M. Mettler[60], enumerated several advantages obtained by
applying Block Chain in smart Health Care. For example,
health data can be stockpiled on the Block Chain in a safe,
way. The Characteristics of Block Chain viz., no particular
point of failure (as it is distributed), complete pellucidity,
strong cryptographic techniques, near 100% immutability
and its ability to use insightful contracts, makes it the most
preferred mechanism of data integrity in the Cloud. These
Characteristics has ignited the Block Chain revolution,
which has not only swept the feet of the financial industry
by storm, but is also making inroads in every sector like
Health Care, energy, retail, governance, supply chain and
agriculture, including Data integrity; thereby disrupting the
walks of life of people.
The ground-breaking Block Chain technology is useful to
solve many challenges like: Immutability (transaction
cannot be changed once it is agreed and shared across the
distributed network), Innovation (ample space for new
creation of Block Chains), Reduced Transaction
Expenses(with elimination of the third parties), Security
(due to decentralization),Transparency (since all alterations
are made public).Block Chain Data Integrity in Cloud,
ensures that the data assets stored on the Cloud are intact
and nothing has been tampered with. A Keyless Signature

Infrastructure (KSI™) via a RESTful API is enough to
provide the desired integrity.
The utilization of Block Chain technology, offers reliability
(decentralized architecture) and safety in the Health Care
system. The Block Chain can alleviate problems arising
from the privacy and integrity of patient information, due to
the features of Block Chain, such as immutability,
transparency and reliability. Block Chain supports in the
management of logs and the auditing of the data.
D. BLOCK CHAIN APPLICATIONS IN HEALTH CARE

The benefits that arise from the integration of Block Chain
techniques with Health Care have been documented by
several authors [3],[34],[69],[75], are the computerized
execution of services, disparity access control for various
user types, the enactment of health-care regulations,
logistics, distant data collection, indexing, the unification
or calibration of information, redundancy and fault
lenience.
The general key aids for implementing Block Chain
technology in IoMT, biomedical and Health Care
applications are 24/7 monitoring and data access, Business
Model changes, Consistent rules via smart contract, data
provenance, data storage and security, decentralized
management, immutable audit trail, Integrity of medical
records , interoperable health data access, medical supply
chain efficiency, robustness, availability, security, privacy,
Budget friendly, Single data source, Single patient
identification, Storage capacity and value-based payment
mechanisms. Uniting the Block Chain technology with IoT,
it can augment the reliability (due to immutability of the
data) of the evidence carried in real time.
1).BLOCK
CHAIN-BASED
HEALTH
ASSET
TRACKING AND MANAGEMENT IN THE SUPPLY
CHAIN
The Block Chain assists in the management of drug supply
chains, primarily because of its immutability
characteristics, which makes the forgery of drug, more
challenging (for example the tragic consequences for the
Nigeria population). The Block Chain can thus be applied
to many areas like control and management of drugs. Block
Chain assists in monitoring the dispersal of drugs, and
check that the resources trail the supply chain pattern
fittingly. Say for example, in drug distribution, cycling
through all the stages in the supply chain, assist in
combating drug counterfeiters, such as the deviation of
pharmaceutical products and theft.
2).HEALTH CARE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
The Block Chain protocols are used in Health Care
information management to control transactions, process of
distributing electronic health records, with increased
security, immutability of data, and privacy. The Block
Chain satisfies the necessities to improve the quality and
security of data transfer, as well as the reduction of energy

costs. As the consensus protocols are becoming more
advanced, they can be used in the resource-constrained
devices (e.g., IoMT), as from light consensus protocols
such as PBFT and SCP [37]. The Block Chain endorses the
sharing and storage of medical big data.
3). SECURE SHARING & STORAGE OF HEALTH
CARE DATA
All the stakeholders who are into Health Care are to
securely share patients’ medical Data. The shared
untampered data relevant to the patients are necessary to
make good Health Care decisions. The speedy development
of Block Chain ensures the sharing and stowing of health
data on the Block Chain in an absolute, safe and consistent
way. The primary protocol that is involved in the network
trust building processes are the consensus protocol, which
helps to share patient records, images sharing, Log
Management in Health Care Systems, managing Health
Care information, Patient Monitoring with the aid of
personal sensors, reliability and monitoring patients
through sensors with limited hardware.
The medical data is to be stored securely, especially with
good data honesty, which is a daunting task. The medical
data like patients’ complete medical histories, are stored
and maintained using a Block Chain communally in a
decentralized way.
The Block Chain endorses the importance of Block Chain
technology in the Health Care industry by utilizing it in a
number of other ways – namely, for increased reliability,
increased efficiency, privacy, security, developing
integration, and lots more.
4). PRIVACY AND SECURITY IN BLOCK CHAIN
FOR HEALTH CARE
Feng, et al., [24] has listed about the prevailing challenges
of privacy in the Block Chain as (i) Identity privacy preserve the user’s private identity, without linking to the
transaction and (ii) Transaction privacy - guaranteeing the
inaccessibility to the contents of transaction by
unauthorized users.
The striking literatures, citing the utilization of Block Chain
to achieve, privacy in health care are : Cynthia Dwork, et
al.,[13] work on differential privacy, Abbas Acar, et al.,[1]
work on homomorphic cryptography , M. Sabt, et al.,[61]
work on trusted execution environments (TEE) , and Eli
Ben-Sasson, et al.,[20] work on zk-snarks (derived from the
zero-knowledge proof).
IV. CLOUD COMPUTING

Cloud computing is defined by National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST), as “Cloud computing is
a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand
network access to a shared pool of configurable computing
resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,

and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released
with minimal management effort or service provider
interaction. This Cloud model is composed of five essential
characteristics, three service models, and four deployment
models”.

A. CLOUD SECURITY ISSUES

In spite of the countless highly prioritized Cloud security
issues, like, Elasticity, Network Diffidence, still data
integrity gets its prime focus from all the stakeholders
owing to the significance of the concept of data currency.
The data integrity might be compromised due to reasons
like human errors, software bugs, hardware faults or
malicious attacks.
V. CONFLUENCE OF BLOCK CHAIN IN HEALTH CAREIoMT

The IoMT and Block Chain technologies are perfect when
they are working in silos, but have their own limitations.
Both technologies are integrated together and this
confluence of IoMT and Block Chain assures the following:
 Affordability
 continuously monitor the activities of the children
and the aged people is made seamless; sends an
automatic alert to the concerned persons if any
health condition goes awry.
 Easy management of patients records by Doctors
 Energy efficiency
 Eventual benefit is healthier and longer lives,
 Improved Life quality, Outcome of patient, user
end experience
 Improvisation in care for patient
 Make life more convenient
 Management of diseases is real-time
 Maximum diseases management and inhibition
 Reduction in operational costs
 Simplicity, Ease to use
A. BENEFITS OF BLOCK CHAIN IN HEALTH CAREIoMT

The merging of the Block Chain and IoMT technologies
enables not only Remote Patient Monitoring but also the
Collection and integration of Clinical Data (say for
instance-administrative data, clinical trial data, disease
archives, health insurance entitlements, health surveys, etc.)
in a unified cost-effective manner, that helps in selfgoverning, thereby reducing time and effort. Block Chain
finds its use in identifying and treating diseases like
aberrations in internal organs, cancer, apt utilization of
sensory devices such as ingestible pills, heartbeat monitors,
and more.
Listing a few of the paybacks of Block Chain in Health
Care IoMT:








Collaboration – assists to manage and sync in a
proper way through distributed ledger technology,
and sustains the innovation in the field;
Data Provenance & Integrity – supports to handle
the surge in the rise in the number of users and
devices of Health Care facilities to process and store
information;
Data Protection – ensures to safeguard important
documents and information, prohibits unauthorized
users to access information and data;
Monitoring – helps to authorize to access the
medical information, document transactions in
correct format, transparent, saves time, effort, and
cost;
Simplifying the Process – relieves the effort to
safeguard heavily and this results in an overall
improvement to the system.
Enables the realisation of Smart Hospitals – Even
locating an individual or a machine/thing, which,
saves a lot of clerical tasks and catalogue managing
activities that are done more efficiently, cutting
down the cost for Health Care service providers.
Provides one-to-one health care for emergencies,
Intensive Care Units (ICU).

VI.LITERATURE REVIEW ON BLOCK CHAIN IN H-IOT

Every day lots of researchers are contributing to the
development of a fool proof block chain-based Health Care
services.
J. Zhang, et al., [54], proposed a protocol to collect data and
disseminate the collected data amid the Pervasive Social
Network (PSN) nodes. Q.Xia, et al., [74], gave, a foursomelayer edifice named as MedShare, which, uses smart
contracts to manage the contact to the data in the Block
Chain.
M. A. Uddin , et al., [88] proposed a Block Chain based
privacy preserved architecture to ceaselessly monitor the
patient’s health. The tailored Block Chain has a PatientCentric Agent (PCA), to remotely monitor. PCA takes
control of the sorting of stored data based on their
criticalness, favouring the drillers.
J. Xie , et al., [53] mentions that the primary application of
Block Chain is to store and provide access control to the
collected medical data, which results in security, integrity,
and privacy. M. Simic, G, et al., [62], proposed a big data
application with Block Chain for medical data
management; as the Block Chain imparts bounciness and
security to the data collected by the sensor nodes.
A. BLOCK CHAIN-BASED APPROACHES IN IOMT

Block Chain Concept Without Technical Specifications,
Modified Cryptographic Technique and Modified
Consensus Protocol.
1). Ethereum-Based Contributions An Ethereumbased architecture was proposed by Mohan, S.,et al., [65],
to remotely monitor diabetes patients, with smart contracts
managing the data access .The private Ethereum-based
architecture proposed by Malamas, V[63], implements the
consensus mechanism using smart contracts. The proposed
framework directs the players’ pleas to the medical or the
technical possessions; uses three Smart Contract (SC)
functionalities to enable the registration [Registration
Smart Contract (RSC)], authorization [Actor Handling
Smart Contract (AHSC)] and logging requests [Log
Management Smart Contract (LMSC)]. An InterPlanetary
File (IPFS) stores all the health-related data. A Proof of
Medical Stack (PoMS) is proposed to protect the smart
contracts from malicious actions.
A private Ethereum-based Block Chain was proposed by
Khatoon, A. [57], for managing the medical data. It works
on Ethereum smart contracts to allow data access amid all
involved entities. The smart contract is made of nifty
depictions of medical records along with approvals, record
proprietorship metadata and data integrity. The medical
data is stockpiled off-chain (external server) and the
cryptographic hash is kept on the Block Chain ensuring
data integrity.
Nguyen, D.C, et al., [72], developed a Cloud-based IoMT
framework data with an Ethereum-based Block Chain
network to safely transfer and share data amid Health Care
users. Smart contracts control users access to data in the
Cloud, and to monitor the development, to store and
process.
Griggs, K.N, et al., [30], proposed a permissioned Block
Chain-based architecture to safely monitors patient
using Ethereum. The smart contracts analyse data and
send alerts to alert caregivers. Practical Byzantine Fault
Tolerance (PBFT) is used as an alternative to PoW
consensus model. The proposed architecture is deficient to
meet the issues related to IoMT-Block Chain integration.
2). Hyperledger-Based Contributions - Attia, O, et al.,
[4], proposed an IoT-Block Chain based architecture to
permit monitoring of health remotely. There are two types
of Block Chain, named as Medical Devices Block Chain,
and Consultation Block Chain. A user interface is
developed to envision the patient health data. The
transactions are substantiated and authenticated using Chain
codes in Fabric.
3). Modified Consensus Protocol - Uddin, M.A., [59],
proposed a consortium block chain-based architecture.
The authors developed a patient agent software (PA) to
define the Block Chain functionalities and is deployed on

the Edge computing network. The Smart contracts are used
to manage health data including filtering clinically useless
health data, generating alarm for some events, drift data to
the Cloud if necessary, classify data and others. Compared
to PoS, authors maintain that the adapted PoS is more
effectual in term of energy consumption and block
generation time.
4). Modified Cryptographic Technique - Natarajan, B, et
al., [89] used hashing technique and a novel encryption
algorithm for encryption. The algorithm covers all the
medical objects with very low time complexity supporting
the real time obligation of IoMT.
Dwivedi, A, et al., [19], tailored the Block Chain-based
framework and made it private to evade the POW
consensus protocol. The high-volume data produced by
IoMT devices, are congregated as encoded data in blocks
and stockpiled the combined blocks in the Cloud. The
hashes of blocks are set aside on the Block Chain.
Uddin, M.A, et al., [89], proposed ring signature which is
used as standard public key based digital signature to
guarantee the privacy.
5). General Block Chain Concept Without Technical
Specifications - Gupta, S, et al., [32], used the tamper
proof feature of Block Chain to safely share and store the
IoMT data. The patient data are stockpiled as
blocks(strings) in the Block Chain and the IoMT data are
stored in blocks in off-chain database. Smart contracts
ensure the privacy and security of the Block Chain.
Shen, B, et al., [83], proposed a MedChain consortium
Block Chain-based framework to efficiently share data
streams generated from medical sensors. The MedChain
network has two separate decentralized sub-networks Block Chain network, and P2P network. MedChain uses the
BFT-SMaRt as a consensus protocol. Seliem, M, et al.,
[82] proposed the BIoMT, which is an optimized,
lightweight Block Chain-based framework. The
proposed architecture is made up of four stratum-namely,
Device layer, Facility layer, Cloud layer, and the Cluster
layer. This work does not provide any technical details. It is
neither implemented nor evaluated. Dilawar, N, et al., [17]
and Uddin, M.A, et al., [88], proposed a Block Chain-based
architecture to allow secure transmission and storage of
large amount of sensitive data generated by IoMT.
VII. RESEARCH GAPS IN BLOCK CHAIN ADOPTED
IoMT

Though the integration of IoMT and Block Chain
technologies assures, continuous monitoring, relaxed
management, improved Quality of Life, comfortable,
maximum diseases management and inhibition in real-time,
reduction in operational costs, effortlessness and calm to
use; there are still many challenges to be attended to.

Moreover, problems like, the requirement of constrained
devices in Health Care applications have to be taken care.
A. UNSOLVED OPEN ISSUES

The literature review showcases many research gaps.
Integrating Block Chain technology with Internet of
Medical Things (IoMT)gives rise to numerous challenges
due to the differing necessities in these two technologies:

are bandwidth-limited.

A quick review of the literature on the research challenges
faced by the confluence of Block Chain adopted IoMT are
as follows:
Chao-Hsi Huang , et al., [11], points out the research gaps
in the Intelligence area of Medical Care. Boyi Xu , et al.,
[8], mentions in their paper the issues pertaining to the
integration of data. Hyun Jung La Han Ter Jung , et al.,
[36],discussed the challenges in the Software
implementation of medical analytic schemes. They further
explained the Technical challenges involved in Modeling
the relationship between acquired measurement and
diseases.
Boyi Xu , et al., [8], Foteini Andriopoulou , et al., [25],
pointed out the Interoperability issues arising from the
things. Shu-yuan Ge et al., [84], discussed the issues related
to constraints over network performance like bandwidth,
CPU capacity and Memory of the system. Matar, G, et al.,
[64], indicates the Hardware implementation and design
optimization issues. Pallavi Chavan , et al., [73] specifies
the issues arising due to the amorphous, rising and varied
data at exponential rate.
Tsoutsouras, V, et al., [87] discussed the challenges related
to data privacy, flexibility and evolution of applications,
low power consumption, managing device diversity, need
for medical expertise, real time processing, scale, data
volume and performance, system predictability. Foteini
Andriopoulou , et al., [25] specifies the issues arising due to
the availability of resources, data exchange and privacy.
Several authors [25],[78],[87] have documented the
security research challenges.

For storing the big IoMT data, most of works [72 ]
proposed an off-chain storage. Some researches [32,63]
proposed to use IPFS because of its distributed data
structure. Authors like Nguyen, D.C, et al., [72] , Dwivedi,
A, et al., [19], Khatoon, A.: ., et al., [57], Seliem, M., ., et
al., [82],Uddin, M.A., et al., [89] , proposed the encryption
of data prior to storage in the Cloud, and placing the hash
references of the data in the Block Chain. But it doesn’t
stand guarantee for immutability. In fact, any alteration of
data will be spotted by the hash stored in the Block Chain.
Authors like, Khatoon, A, et al., [57] , have exterminated
the consensus protocol to meet IoMT necessities.
Malamas, V , et al., [63] used smart contract to self-verify
and self-execute transactions ; but it is subjected to threats
using a lightweight consensus mechanism. Griggs, K.N, et
al., [30] proposed a lightweight consensus protocol. PoS
protocol have been modified to fit in the IoMT
environments [Malamas, V, et al., [63], Uddin, M.A, et al.,
[89]. A few authors [Dwivedi, A , et al., [19] have
aggregated nodes into clusters, selected a header for every
group to effect transactions, and to authenticate and create
blocks. Some other authors have given solutions novel
framework for trading range counting results like [Zhipeng
Cai, et al., [94];privacy-preserved data sharing framework
for IIoTs, where multiple competing data consumers exist
in different stages of the system [Xu Zheng, et al., [91] ;a
work targeting coin hopping attack[Saide Zhu et al., [79]
(2019)]; ABE model with parallel outsourced decryption
for edge intelligent IoV, called ABEM-POD[Chaosheng
Feng, et al., [12] and a novel mechanism for data uploading
in smart cyber-physical systems, which considers both
energy conservation and privacy preservation[Zhipeng Cai,
et al., [93].
Most of the earlier works have given solutions to bring
about and regulate access rights. Most of the solutions
[Nguyen, D.C, et al., [72],Khatoon, A, et al., [57],
Malamas, , et al., [63], Mohan, S, et al., [65], deploy smart
contracts to permit access to only permitted users based on
some attributes of the IoMT ecosystem and their
collaboration with the users. The authors [19], [71], [89]
proposed a lightweight privacy-preserving algorithms to
preserve patient privacy .
Other works that is of interest are : Zhiwei Guo, et al., [95]
proposed Collaborative neural network-based Spammer
detection mechanism (Co-Spam) in social media
applications; Zhipeng Cai, et al.,[94] proposed a novel
framework for trading range counting results.
Several issues have been studied and relevant solutions
have been proposed for data (like security) in the IoMT,
Block Chain, Cloud. But still a lacuna is there which can be
looked as an opportunity for finding the apt technical
resolutions, and this paper is intended at such a trivial step.
Lacuna like Lack of standards are yet to be attended. A

few worth mentioning and the pertinent concepts of
preserving privacy are prevailing in literatures, [26-29],
[38-51],[66-68],[81],[90].Most of the research on Block
Chain in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), is focused
only on privacy, data integrity, concealment and
authentication. But it doesn’t tackle the problems arising
out of big data stream produced by resource-constrained
IoMT devices.

VIII. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Propose, design a generic Layered Architecture christened
as, “Block Chain based Internet of Medical Things for
Uninterrupted, Ubiquitous, User-friendly, Unflappable,
Unblemished, Unlimited Health Care Services (BC
IoMT U6 HCS) framework”. The architecture is designed to
effect a patient centric health care, seamless user
responsive, Block Chain based Internet of Medical Things
that can manage, safeguard patient data in transit, storage,
authenticate, audit, validate data in the Health Care - IoMT
Cloud environment.
A. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

The proposed Layered Architecture is designed to minimize
the research gaps arising out of the challenges and
necessities for the confluence of Block Chain (BC), Internet
of Medical Things (IoMT), Cloud Computing (CC). The
requirements that are needed for the real-time remote
Health Care of one-to-one care Block Chain based Internet
of Medical Things are taken into consideration in the
design. Hence, the genesis of the novel BC IoMT U6 HCS
(Block Chain based Internet of Medical Things for
Uninterrupted, Ubiquitous, User-friendly, Unflappable,
Unblemished, Unlimited Health Care Services) Layered
Architecture, to support the vital functions critical for
Patient Centric Health Care.

b.

Uninterrupted Health Care Services – The
services offered are 24*7 and support to stream
the body parameters of patients from remote
locations through their personal devices using
mobile and desktop apps via Wi-Fi connections, to
doctors. This protect the patients from any new
infections (Say for example, by contact tracing,
alerting the proximity of infected patients near
their locations) and to provide quality and
uninterrupted care to all who need these,
including patients with acute diseases, children
and elderly population. The supervision and
feedback system from doctors are offered through
various modes like the video/web conferencing.
Ubiquitous Health Care Services - The
ubiquitous availability of personalized medical
services is made obtainable due to the intelligent
computing systems that acclimatize to the user,
and whose interfaces to the wearable devices or
Internet of Medical/Health Things, allow the user
to make inborn use of the system, fitting in mobile
devices, newly enhanced, more prevailing, and
less controlled versions of medical sensors and
equipment.

IX. PROPOSED BLOCK CHAIN BASED INTERNET OF
MEDICAL THINGS

The usage of Block Chain in the proposed system imparts
decentralization, security, integrity, anonymity, good
performance, elasticity and security to the data collected by
the IoMT. The general Secure Privacy Conserving Provable
Data Possession (SPC-PDP) framework [48], is used
optionally to provide an additional layer for safeguarding
the data integrity along with privacy preserving, batch
auditing, and dynamic data auditing. When the SPC-PDP
framework is concomitated it supports data validation,
verification, secrecy for Cloud storage; along with the
decentralization, security, integrity, anonymity, good
performance, resilience and security of IoMT with Block
Chain.
The proposed Block Chain Based Internet of Medical
Things offers the users a six-pronged strategy by an
uninterrupted, ubiquitous, user-friendly, unflappable,
unblemished, unlimited Health Care services.

The future drift is from single- sensor platforms to multisensor platforms (multiple sensing elements).
Actuators - A prompter/Actuator (a hardware component)
works on the physical environment and the electrical signal
from the connected device is transformed to activate a
physical action, like turn on or off the alarm. The Actuator
is configured using software. Actuators, act on the direct
environment to permit right operation of the machines or
devices. The actuators can be four main classes based on
their structural pattern and the role they play in a exact IoT
environment-(i) Linear actuators (permit motion of objects
or elements in a straight line),(ii) Motors (permit precise
gyratory movements of device components or whole
objects),(iii) Relays (electromagnet-based actuators to
activate power switches in lamps, heaters),(iv) Solenoids –
( for locking or triggering mechanisms in home appliances).

traceable record of connections. This method is valuable in
trade and rent set-ups to get reliability and security. It
records all the exchanges.
The Block Chain (see Figure 5), also controls all the
dealings between service and Cloud providers. This will
grant access to the patient data collected through sensors,
actuators and tags. Gateways are publishers and they create
all the data linked to a patient. The Publishers state the
access control levels and permissions (read/write/modify)
in the Cloud (using smart contracts). Authorities are
subscribers who are able to access the data generated by the
publishers in the Cloud.

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a radio object
detection technology utilizing the radio frequency
technology indications for very short-range communique.
Radio-frequency identification (RFID) sensors/Tags - have
unique identifiers and are be armed with a variety of
sensing capabilities. RFID tags are also used to send
signals. RFID communications is affected between two
entities- RFID reader (reading device) and RFID tag . The
RFID tags can be of two types - active reading tags (driven
by power, costly, utilize high-frequency bands) and passive
reading tags (work on lower frequencies, lack core power

Ethereum is open sourced, distributed, blockchain-based
framework for evolving applications. Applications run on
each node, and each state transition produced by them is
validated and recorded by the blockchain. Ethereum Virtual
Machine (EVM), is used to create applications. Ethereum
platform (Permissioned/permission-less) works on has
Customizable Consensus, is used to generate the medical
formats, rules and state transition functions for medical
transaction. Ethereum ‘s smart contract platform is
preferred due to the degree of standardization and easier

contract programming language, to achieve the
standardization and it eases the setting up contracts. In
Smart contracts two or more separate parties enter into an
agreement through digital contracts.

access the patient records only upon the grant of consent
from the data owner; this is for legitimate rights.

C. MANAGEMENT LAYER

The management layer is subdivided into
 data usage layer (IoMT, supply chain and
authentication),
 data management layer (data analysis, data
management, user management) and
 data storage layer (data storage, Cloud services).
Security and privacy are like two sides of coin and they are
critical. Data created is stored on blocks or on the Cloud
storage. The Cloud provider layer will take care of all the
processing and storage capacities in the Cloud.

Every block includes data of the patient, originating time of
the block, and the block creator information. Based on the
amount of mining data, the block is endorsed. Reward is
given to the initial miner who solves the mathematical
riddle, and broadcasts the created block to all peers in the
network, gets the reward. Upon acceptance of the new
block by a greater number of peers, it gets inserted into the
chain. The block gets forked and is orphaned in the chain if
it is not matching with the previous block. After the block
gets added to the chain, it cannot be detached or changed
without disturbing adjacent blocks. This aids in viewing the
Patients past in a very authentic innocent manner, deprived
of any anxiety of getting tampered.
X. IMPLEMENTATION

Connected medical devices that are less intrusive and more
comfortable to use like wearables, collects data on
environment, nutrition, and other body vitals and streams it.

Section 11 discusses the observed result and analysis. In
this section, the proposed BC IoMT U6 HCS Framework
are practically validated to achieve the results.
Results related to Layered Architecture demonstrate the
advantages of, “BC IoMT U6 HCS,” over the existing
framework. Finally, in this paper the main results observed
and the conclusions drawn from the experiments are
reported.
Figure 7, shows the efficiency obtained by the BC IoMT U6
HCS framework, in contrast with the conservative
frameworks. With increase in the quantity of files, the
reliability is more or less obstinate in both the earlier and
proposed frameworks.

FIGURE 7. Data Volume versus Reliability

Figure 8, shows the efficiency obtained by the BC IoMT U6
HCS framework, in contrast with the conservative
frameworks. With increase in the quantity of records, the
efficiency appears to be more or less persistent in both the
earlier and proposed ones.

FIGURE 8. Data Volume (Number of Records) versus Efficiency
FIGURE 6. Steps for Block Chaining

This if need be, is combined with clinical data (medical
procedures or laboratory tests), and the physicians are able
to get a holistic picture of the patient’s health to make more
informed diagnostic or treatment decisions. Post treatment
the patients are continually monitored.

XI. RESULT AND ANALYSIS

The size of attributes in a record is kept a persistent and the
number of records is progressively enlarged to meter the
competence of the framework. It is observed that rise in the
amount of records the BC IoMT U6 HCS framework are
competent and adeptly attains secure auditing, privacy,
integrity and surpasses the erstwhile Generic IoMT
framework.
Figure 9, shows the efficiency obtained by the BC IoMT U6
HCS framework in contrast with the conservative
frameworks. Even with rise in the quantity of attributes;

efficiency is more or less same in both the existing and
proposed frameworks. Keeping the amount of records a
constant; increasing the number of attributes the efficiency
of the framework is measured. It is observed that as we
increase the number of attributes the BC IoMT U6 HCS
framework more competently and capably achieves secure
auditing, privacy, integrity and excels the former Generic
IoMT framework.
.

FIGURE 9. Attributes vs Efficiency

The time taken to run rises with an increase in data volume
and is more or less same for both the frameworks - BC
IoMT U6 HCS framework, Generic IoMT framework. The
amount of time taken to recover the user data-running time,
is just very few seconds. After the execution of the project,
the time consumed by the challenge and response is
calculated. It is noted that with increase in file size, time
spent also upsurges. Time duration of diverse file sizes
fluctuates only in few milli seconds and this is very
negligible for the user /verifier to cannot observe the
alteration in challenge and reply.

automation, immutability, near-impossible loss of data,
permanence, removal of intermediaries, decentralization of
consensus, but also overcomes most of the issues especially
the security issues of through the use of latest encryptions.
The fusion has no doubt made possible, the effective
deployment Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), demands
for more individualized, patient-centric care IoMT that
augments affordability (cost effective care, reduced
operational costs) ,simplicity and easy to use, improved life
quality, life more comfortable, convenient, healthier and
longer lives, provide proactive approach to preserving good
health, cater to remote medical support care, continuous
monitoring, allow patients to direct health information data
to doctors ,augments precise disease identifications,

accelerate clinician workflows, improvisation in care for
patient , easy management of patients records by doctors,
keep personal health records, energy efficiency, manage
drugs, outcome of patient, user end experience, empowers
extreme connectivity due to better automation and
perceptions in the DNA of IoMT functions. The main
contributions of this paper are full analysis including the
challenges of the present-day IoMT, Block Chain, Cloud
storage data schemes in the domain of health care; design
and develop a novel BC IoMT U6 HCS (Block Chain based
Internet of Medical Things for Uninterrupted, Ubiquitous,
User-friendly, Unflappable, Unblemished, Unlimited
Health Care Services) layered architecture, which, will also
support the vital functions essential for public auditing.
The results from the Layered Architecture has validated and
has proved to be competent in achieving safe auditing and
surpass the former ones in privacy, reliability and integrity.
To sum up this paper provides a panoramic view on the
present position of current research, and imminent
directions of Block Chain Based Internet of Medical
Things.
XIII. FUTURE WORK

FIGURE 10. Data Volume versus Running Time

Figure 10, shows the efficiency obtained by the BC IoMT
U6 HCS framework, in comparison with the conventional
layered architecture. With an increase in the size of files,
the reliability appears to be more or less obstinate in both
the previous and proposed layered architecture.
XII. CONCLUSIONS

Section 12 highlights the main conclusions. The fusion of
the IoMT, Cloud Storage with Block Chain technologies
not only offers benefits like reduced cost, speed,

The consensus algorithm has the following constraints that
does not allow its adaptation and utilization in many of the
existing IoMT- frameworks. Future research work can be
undertaken in along the following lines like (i) The time
taken endorse the blocks is non-compliant with IoMT-QoS;
(ii)The high computational resources, are needed for the
consensus algorithms which cannot be afforded by the
IoMT; (iii) Sharing of cryptographic key in a dispersed
WBAN is yet to be resolved;(iv) threats arising due to
identity-based network layer is yet to be resolved.
The research gaps that are to be resolved are identified
briefly as (i) escalating initial expenditure in adopting the
new technology; (ii)Research Gaps in Philosophy – the
global community, has to adopt to the purchase of the
technology; (iii) Research Gaps in Energy- Block Chain
for sustaining its operations uses a network of nodes, and
ensuing extensive computing power; (iv) Research Gaps in
