ABSTRACT
Nowadays, encephalograms (EEG) have many applications in marketing, psychology, neuroscience, psychiatric
studies and brain computer interfaces. The last one is being motivated by the advance of technology that now allows
known details of brain’s areas related with cognitive, motion and sensorial activities, using these information to operate
mechanical devices with the brain. This paper has as objective make an experiment for acquiring brain signals associated
with the thoughts of a movement to left or right from a person with motion disability, these signals will pass by a band pass
filter, a common spatial pattern analysis (CSP) and lately are classify through support vector machines (SVM). Obtaining
as a result, recognition of 70% from the imaginary movement signals to left and 80% of recognition from the signals
related to the imaginary movement to right.
Keywords: electroencephalogram, common spatial patterns, support vector machines, emotiv.

1. INTRODUCTION
A brain computer interface (BCI) is a system
which is able to detect cognitive, sensorial and motion
activities from a user and use this information as inputs for
controlling a mechanical or electric system [1].Nowadays,
devices for detecting these brain activities are noninvasive,
due to use of superficial electrodes located specifically
according with the international standard 10:20 [2].
The main problem with this type of electrodes is
that the captured signal can have noise or detected wrong
signals. Due to this, the captured signals need a stronger
treatment that allow an appropriate identification and
classification[3][4].
Depend of the application for the BCI, is possible use
different data processing methodologies, in the specific
case of motion imagination the method more popular for
the identification of encephalogram (EEG) captured by
superficial sensors is the common spatial pattern (CSP)
analysis [5].
The CSP analysis seeks determine the features
spatially filtered that allow maximize the variance of one
class and at the same time minimize the variance with the
other class, reason why are obtained the same features
number for both class allowing classify two tasks of
imaginary movement [6].
A common complement in the identification and
classification of imaginary movement signals beside of the
CSP for the features extraction is the support vector
machine (SVM). The SVM is a machine learning
algorithm for a general classification of at least two tasks,
based on the construction of a hyperplane that divide
spatially all samples per class [7].
Example of the combination of these algorithms
is the thesis developed by Quang le, which used CSP and
SVM to recognize two imaginary movements of patients
with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, where was
recognized 83% of the recollected samples [8]. Similarly,
the work made in [9] used the SVM algorithm to classify
two motion task of a specific user, reaching a recognizing
of 91.64%.

Taking account the previous information, this
work has as objective the development of a data
processing methodology for recognize two tasks of
imaginary movement from a user with physical disability.
This methodology consist in a relevant channels selection,
a sequential filtered with ranges of 4Hz, after is extracted
the features with CSP of each band filtered and the SVM
classify the features of the two imaginary movements.
Obtaining as a result a recognizing of 90% for the
imaginary movement to right and 80% for the imaginary
movement to left.
2. METHODOLOGY
The classification of signals belong of an
imaginary movement to right or left, use signals obtained
from the Brodmann areas processed by filtered technics,
CSP and classify using SVM, as shown the methodology
in Figure-1.

Figure-1. Methodology used.
In this work the Emotiv® sensor was used to
acquire the electric signals of the brain according with the
acquisition paradigm shown in Figure-2. This paradigm
was designed with an initial period of 7 seconds for
configuration, time in which the software of visual stimuli
is synchronized with the software of capture brain signals
through Emotiv®. After this period, the paradigm has 3
seconds where is shown a Cartesian axis, which refer to
the waiting time and continue other 3 seconds where is
shown the visual stimulus for help the user to imagine the
movement to left or right.

Figure-2. Data acquisition paradigm.
The visual stimulus consist in an arrow moving
from the center of the Cartesian axis to left or right during
3 seconds, the movement of the arrow corresponds to the
movement of the user need to imagine.
Each paradigm’s session takes 67 seconds in
which the user imagine 10 times the movement to left or
right, due to that the experiment consist in 10 sessions,
200 samples for training the SVM were obtained.
Once the samples were obtained, the
methodology shown in Figure-3 was used, in which starts
with a selection of channels that give relevant information
about the imaginary movement to left or right.

αα𝑇

tr αα𝑇

Where α𝑇 is the transposed matrix, tr refers to
the diagonal sum of the elements of αα𝑇 ). Consequently,
the spatial covariance is define for both the imaginary
movement to left as the imaginary movement to right.
The CSP seeks define a matrix X that with
define the diagonal of the matrix𝐴 for the imaginary
movement to left and𝐴 for the imaginary movement to
right[15]. This information is represented by the equation
2 where𝐴 + 𝐴 = 𝐼(identity matrix).
𝑇

With the equation 2, the composed spatial
covariance was define in the equation 3[16].
δ =δ +δ

(3)

Knowing thatδ factorized is equal toδ =
U A 𝑈 𝑇 where U is the eigenvectors matrix andA is the
diagonal of the eigenvalues matrix. In this way, the
whitening transform was calculated through the equation 4
for equalize the variances in the space covered by U [17].

Figure-3. Dara processing methodology.
For the channels selection, the toolbox EEGLAB
of MATLAB® was used, which allowed determine the
Event Related Potentials (ERP) of each sample. With the
ERP is possible observe the answer from the brain to an
imaginary movement in each channel of the Emotiv®,
allowing a comparison among channels and determining
which ones are the most relevant channels [10], [11].
Once selected the relevant channels during the
motion imagination is necessary proceed with the feature
extraction. For that the captured signals from each relevant
channel are filtered in the frequencies related to the motion
imagination.
Previous studies have demonstrated that the brain
waves alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) have a major
activation during the imagination of a movement both left
as right[12],[13]. Due to this information, for this work a
sequential filter with range of 4Hz from 8Hz to 30Hz was
used.
For the filtering process two types of bandpass
filter were used, a FIR equiripple filter and IIR elliptic
filter. With the filtered signals, the CSP analysis was used
in order to extract the main features of each signal.
In the CSP analysis each signal is represented by
a matrix compoused by n x m, where n is the number of
channels and m is the number of samples per channel.
With this information the spatial covariance of the matrix
(δ) was calculated with the equation 1.

𝑃 = √A

−

𝐶𝑆𝑃 =

𝑇

𝑈𝑇

(4)

Once equalized the variances is possible define
that the eigenvalues ofU A 𝑈 𝑇 are equal both the
imaginary movement to left S = 𝑃δ 𝑃𝑇
as the
imaginary movement to right (S = 𝑃δ 𝑃𝑇 ). That means
that both imaginary movements have the same eigenvector
matrix (Y) [18].
Once established the previous parameters is
possible filter spatially using equation 2 and redefine it
as 𝑇 = 𝑇 𝑃, in this way extract the main features of the
signal using equation 4.

(5)

The CSP is an analysis to discriminate the two
imaginary movements through the number of used
channels; the CSP obtains the same number of features.
This mean that the CSP gives a square matrix where the
first half are the features related with the imaginary
movement to left and the second half are the features
related with the imaginary movement to right.
With the extracted features for both imaginary
movements, they was used for training the SVM labeling
the imaginary movement to left with 1 and the imaginary
movement to right with -1.
The SVM seeks create a surface or hyperplane
that separate the 2 labeled classes (1,-1), but due to the
signals are not lineal is necessary use the Kernel function
to classify the two imaginary movements, in this case the
SVM is represented by equation 5.

WhereΦ
is the dimensional space of the data,
where is added the Gaussian function of Kernel
represented by𝐾( , ) = exp − || − || , which
seeks separate spatially the two classes. This mean that
one class is spatially projected to up and the other class is
spatially projected to down, allowing an appropriate
separation between the two classes, as is shown in figure
4.

Taking into account that the perpendicular vector

With the SVM established, the 200 samples were
taken to train 11 support vector machines, one for each
relevant channel selected. From all the samples, the 80%
was used for training the SVMs and the 20% remained
was used for validating the training of each SVM.

Figure-5. ERP for the imaginary movement to left
and to right.
From this spatial selection, the channels AF3, F4
and P7 were discarded due to that their information were
not relevant during neither of the imaginary movements.
After selected the 11 channels, each one was filtered with
a bandpass filter FIR and IIR. Taking into account that the
Emotiv’s sample frequency is 128 Hz, the samples
presented frequencies between 0 Hz and 64Hz.
In order to filter between 8Hz and 30Hz, two
types of bandpass filter were used. In figure 6 is shown
that the filter IIR allowed the pass of near frequencies of
the desired cutting frequencies. On the other hand, the
filter FIR presented a faster response that did not allow the
pass of additional frequencies.

3. RESULTS
The Emotiv® sensor has 14 sensor (AF3, AF4,
F7, F8, F3, F4, FC5, FC6, T7, T8, P7, P8, O1 and O2)
distributed according with the international standard
10:20. Using the MATLAB’s toolbox the signals capture
by the Emotiv® were processed to identify the ER, as is
shown in Figure-5.

Figure-6. Response of the fast fourier transform of a

With the filtered samples was possible extract the
main features trough CSP, obtained as a result 7 features
that describe the imaginary movement to left and 7
features that describe the imaginary movement to right.
These features are shown in Figure-7, where 7 of
10 samples of the imaginary movement to right had a
downward trend in the fourth feature. On the other hand, 8
of 10 samples of the imaginary movement to left presented
a fluctuate behavior in the fourth and fifth feature.

With the extracted features of the brain signals,
the 80% of these features were used to train 11 support
vector machines, one for each selected channel. Taking
into account that the imaginary movement to left was
labeled with (1) and the imaginary movement to right was
labeled with (-1), then the 20% of the remained features
were used to validate the SVMs, this process was made
both for features filtered by FIR and IIR filter.

On the other hand, the SVMs recognized 4/4
samples filtered with FIR filter for the imaginary
movement to right and recognized 2/4 samples of the
imaginary movement to left. In each random example the
recognition was given by about 7 SVM but neither
samples presented a correct recognition on the part of the
11 SVMs.
4. CONCLUSIONS
Make the filtering of brain signals with an IIR
filter allowed the pass of additional frequencies to the
desired ones, making more flexible the identification of an
imaginary movement of the user with physical disability.
Prove of the previous is that the 90% of the filtered
samples with IIR filter were recognized both for imaginary
movement to right and left.
On the other hand, the use of FIR filter for
filtering brain signals related with an imaginary movement
of a person with physical disability blocks additional
frequencies, this mean if the user is not concentrated
imagining the movement the SVM cannot recognize the
brain signal. Prove of this trend is the recognition of just
50% and 80% for the samples of an imaginary movement
to left and right respectively.
The using of multiple support vector machines
with different bandpass filter of 4Hz range, allowed a
statistic appreciation in the recognizing of a brain signal
even if the user with physical disability is not concentrated
in imagine a movement or if the brain signal has noise in .
This prove that for recognize an imaginary movement
through the general combination of CSP and SVM
algorithm can have good results and even it can improve

the results applying a different or stronger data processing
methodology .
