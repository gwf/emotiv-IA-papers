Abstract: Measuring brain activity in moving subjects is of great importance for investigating
human behavior in ecological settings. For this purpose, EEG measures are applicable; however,
technical modifications are required to reduce the typical massive movement artefacts. Four different
approaches to measure EEG/ERPs during rowing were tested: (i) a purpose-built head-mounted
preamplifier, (ii) a laboratory system with active electrodes, and a wireless headset combined with
(iii) passive or (iv) active electrodes. A standard visual oddball task revealed very similar (within
subjects) visual evoked potentials for rowing and rest (without movement). The small intraindividual
differences between rowing and rest, in comparison to the typically larger interindividual differences
in the ERP waveforms, revealed that ERPs can be measured reliably even in an athletic movement such
as rowing. On the other hand, the expected modulation of the motor-related activity by force output
was largely affected by movement artefacts. Therefore, for a successful application of ERP measures
in movement research, further developments to differentiate between movement-related neuronal
activity and movement-related artefacts are required. However, activities with small magnitudes
related to motor learning and motor control may be difficult to detect because they are superimposed
by the very large motor potential, which increases with force output.

1. Introduction
The investigation of brain functions with noninvasive methods such as functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG),
near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is typically limited
to laboratory settings. This is because the systems are very large and cannot be moved, and head
movements must be avoided (fMRI, MEG), or head and body movements generate large movement
artefacts. Within the last decade, there has been a rapidly increasing interest in investigating brain
functions in ecological settings (e.g., cognitive or neuropsychological processes in interaction with a
natural environment or in a social context; and movement analysis and motor learning), which require
portable systems [1–6]. Especially in the field of movement research/motor learning, laboratory settings
are strongly limiting, because only simple finger or hand or arm movements can be investigated, and it
is questioned whether the results of these studies can be transferred to complex movements [7–9].
In principle, NIRS and EEG are suited for measures in moving subjects, because the sensors are small
and fixed to the head (rather than the head being fixed to the sensor), and the necessary electronics
and recording devices can be built small enough. NIRS, similar to fMRI, measures the hemodynamic
response related to specific brain processes with a low temporal resolution. Spatially, it is restricted to

cortical layers close to the skull. Ref. [10] used a modified NIRS system successfully in a cognitive
task when subjects were walking around. Ref. [11] developed a miniaturised wearable functional
NIRS system and tested it when subjects performed a left hand gripping task (i) sitting still on a
bicycle, (ii) pedaling indoor on a stationary training bicycle, and (iii) during outdoor bicycle riding.
The event-related data showed that the task was performed successfully and comparably in all three
conditions, whereas data loss was highest in real cycling (about 35%) but much lower in indoor cycling
(7.5%) and under rest (5%).
Event-related potential (ERP) measures, which are the focus of this paper, have the well-known
limited spatial resolution but a high temporal resolution, which is essential to analyse complex
movements: for example, the time course of feedback and feedforward processing in visuomotor
learning [12,13]. Conventional EEG systems are very sensitive to mechanical (cable and electrode
movements) and physiological (electromyogram (EMG) of head and neck muscles, and sweating)
movement artefacts [14]. If cognitive processes in a moving subject rather than the movement itself are
the focus of interest, data preprocessing algorithms informed by the behavioural movement data can
be used to clean the EEG data from movement-related (neuronal and artefactual) activity [15,16]. If the
motor-related activity is of interest, advanced data preprocessing algorithms such as independent
component analysis (ICA) [17] can be used to correct such artefacts. However, a study measuring ERPs
during walking and running on a treadmill showed that data loss was very high (on average 130 of
248 EEG channel signals remained), even using a system with active electrodes that are considerably
less prone to artefacts than conventional passive electrodes [18,19]. Furthermore, the usability of
conventional EEG systems such as the one used in these studies is limited for measures with moving
subjects. In movement tasks with only marginal head movements, such as cycling on an ergometer,
these laboratory systems combined with ICA-based artefact correction can be applied successfully for
EEG measures [20]. Ref. [21] found in a high-intensive cycling exercise an increase in spectral power
when the athletes were fatigued. If spectral changes of higher EEG frequencies (alpha to gamma) are
the focus of interest, such as in ref. [21], artefacts directly coupled to movement execution are outside of
this frequency range, because movement frequencies are considerably lower. However, the harmonics
of these movement frequencies may occur, which have to be considered. With fully moving subjects,
in contrast, artefacts are more difficult to handle. In a cocktail party study (including eating, drinking,
chatting, etc.) with ten subjects wearing self-made (noncommercial) wireless EEG headsets, about 40%
of the data were lost due to artefacts in contrast to 4% in two laboratory studies [22]. Despite this
high data loss, these studies revealed valuable ERP [18,19] or spectral EEG [22] results. However,
especially in movement research, the method of choice is to avoid the generation of mechanical
artefacts beforehand by technical modifications. This approach was used in the four pilot studies
reported in this paper that tested the suitability of different technical solutions to measure ERPs
during ergometer rowing (Figure 1). Especially for analysing motor-related brain activity with ERPs,
rowing is well suited. It is a cyclic movement with a high number of repetitions, and the degrees of
freedom of the movement are limited by the biomechanical constraints of the equipment (boat and
scull/oar, or ergometer). Furthermore, in contrast to e.g., cycling or kayaking, the rowing movement
is composed of different (more or less) distinct movement elements, and the movement frequency
is lower (20–40 strokes/min vs. 60–120 revolutions/min in cycling). Finally, the biomechanical data
(dynamics and kinematics of the movement, and boat and scull/oar movement), which are partly
necessary for ERP analysis, can be measured meanwhile with relative ease.
The most critical question before pilot Study 1 (see below) was whether movement artefacts
distort the EEG data completely or if there are systematic artefacts that can be controlled and either
(partly) excluded or corrected in offline analysis. To test this question, a reliability check was made.
A standard visual oddball task was applied in a rest condition (without movement) and during
ergometer rowing. Similar—not movement-related—ERP activities during rest and during rowing
would show that ERPs can be measured reliably in a moving subject. The second methodological
question—concerning the analysis of motor behavior with ERPs—is: Can movement-related artefacts

be identified and separated from motor-related neuronal activity? As an indicator for a reliable measure
of motor-related activity, at least a motor potential (MP), a negative activity related to force output,
should be expected. Ref. [23] showed in a study that used isometric elbow flexions that the amplitude
of the MP (labeled motor-related cortical potential (MRCP) in this study) correlates very high with
EMG activity (r > 0.8) and the generated muscle force (r = 0.95). Furthermore, in an fMRI study, a high
correlation between isometric force (using a hand-grip dynamometer) and activity in the primary
motor cortex was found [24]. The MP/MRCP must be generated by different generators because
it can already be evoked when a muscle activation is only imagined. This should originate in the
supplementary motor area (SMA) [25]. A second part of the MP is thought to be related to the control

to reduce the generation of artefacts due to cable and electrode movements, a small purpose-built
(according to ref. [26]) battery-powered 20-channel system (based on positive previous experiences
with a similar three-channel system) was used with an occipitally mounted preamplifier (differential
amplifier, gain = 30; hardware filters: 0.27 Hz passive RC highpass; 30 Hz 2nd-order Bessel lowpass).
After a second amplifier stage (total gain = 3600), the signals were digitised using a BEST system
(Dr. Grossegger & Drbal Company, Korneuburg, Austria; sample rate 256 Hz, resolution 0.3 µV/bit).
An electrode cap (EasyCap, EasyCap GmbH, Herrsching-Breitbrunn, Germany, www.easycap.de)
and 22 gold electrodes (Grass Instrument Company, Quincy, MA, USA) with shortened cables were
used. Electrode caps with electrodes fixed to the cap have the disadvantage that the contact of some
electrodes with the skin can be poor, depending on head shape (that is, if there are dents in the skull,
the distance between the cap and skin can be too large). Therefore, the standard adaptors inserted
in the cap were removed, the adaptor holes were enlarged, and the electrodes were fixed using a
highly viscous conductive paste (Elefix, Nihon-Kohden Europe GmbH, Rosbach, Germany). EEG was
recorded from 20 sites (midline: FPz, Fz, FCz, CPz, Pz, and Iz; Left/right: FC1/2, FC3/4, FC5/6, C3/4,
CP1/2, CP3/4, left and right mastoid) covering mainly the sensorimotor area and Iz to assess visual
evoked potentials (VEPs). Data were recorded using Cz as reference and rereferenced offline (see
results for details).
Rowing force was measured with a modified ergometer handle using strain gauges (according to
the measure and analysis of oar forces in rowing [27]), and movement of the sliding seat was measured
with a potentiometer. Biomechanical data were recorded with a second computer, synchronised using
triggers of the Presentation software, and added to the EEG data file offline.
A visual oddball task was used with 180 black–white fullscreen checkerboards (frequent),
60 red–white checkerboards (deviant), and 60 gray crosses (target), which had to be counted.
The stimulus duration was 100 ms, and the interstimulus interval varied randomly between 800
and 1000 ms. The oddball task is a standard paradigm and generates robust ERP components: VEPs
at occipital sites that are generated in the visual cortex when visual stimuli are presented. The P300,
which is most prominent at centroparietal sites (around CPz, Pz), is generated when attention is shifted
to a target stimulus. Stimuli were presented asynchronous to the temporal pattern of the rowing
movement on a computer screen (screen refresh rate 60 Hz) besides the ergometer using the Presentation
software (Neurobehavioral Systems, www.neurobs.com), allowing monitoring the display without
head movements, although eye movement artefacts may be generated. Alternatively, an acoustical
stimulation could be used. However, because the auditory cortex is closer to the sensorimotor cortex
and to the mastoids than the visual cortex, this will probably lead to an extended signal overlay of
motor-related and auditory-evoked potentials.
The EEG was analysed using the Vision Analyzer 1.0 software (BrainProducts, Gilching, Germany).
EEG data were digitally filtered with a 16 Hz/24 dB Butterworth zero phase lowpass, which was
segmented into epochs of −200 to 800 ms around stimulus onset (oddball task) and baseline corrected
(−200 to 0 ms). After applying a semiautomatic procedure for artefact detection (amplitude criterion
±100 µV, gradient 25 µV/sample), the complete datasets were inspected visually for further artefacts,
surviving the automatic rejection. Segments with blink or eye movement artefacts (detectable at
frontal sites) were excluded completely. Traces of single channels containing other clearly visible large
artefacts were removed. If there were more than five contaminated traces, the whole segment was
removed. ERPs were computed for each stimulus category of the oddball task. Motor-related ERPs
were computed triggered by the force onset at the beginning of the rowing stroke.
As a measure of signal quality, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was computed (approximately the
variance of the ERP waveform divided by the variance of the EEG segments underlying the average,
see Appendix A for details). Furthermore, the correlation coefficients (Pearson) between the ERP
waveforms measured during rowing and rest were computed (adopted from ref. [28]). The r-value
would not change if the waveform is attenuated in one condition. However, if the waveform is
distorted by artefacts, the r-value will decrease. Should an attenuation effect be considered as well,

Sensors 2020, 20, 5618

Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient [29] could be used. Alternatively, the area of the difference
between the two waveforms could be computed and related to the areas of the original waveforms.

In contrast to the VEPs, the motor-related ERPs were very noisy and showed large artefacts with
large inter- and intraindividual (implemented by varying force output and stroke rate) differences and
were therefore not interpretable. One observable source of large artefacts was due to the movements
of the cable connecting the head-mounted preamplifier with the second amplifier unit, which led to
movements of the preamplifier and electrode cables.
3. Pilot Study 2
3.1. Materials and Methods
The second approach used a system with active electrodes at the Department of Psychology,
University of Frankfurt. This system suppresses artefacts due to cable movements; however,
electrode movements cannot be avoided completely. During rowing and rest, the amplifiers
were worn in a backpack and connected via fibre-optic cables to a PC. EEG was recorded
continuously with BrainAmp DC amplifiers (BrainProducts, Gilching, Germany; sample rate 250 Hz,
resolution 0.1 µV/bit, input impedance 10 MOhm) using an equidistant EasyCap (EasyCap GmbH,
Herrsching-Breitbrunn, Germany, www.easycap.de) with 62 sintered Ag/AgCl electrodes and built-in
preamplifiers (BrainProducts ActiCap System). Eye blinks and movements were monitored with
supra- and infra-orbital electrodes and with electrodes on the external canthi. The vertex electrode
was used as the reference. To avoid injuries due to skin abrasion, electrode impedances were kept at
20 kOhm, which is more than sufficient from electrical engineering principles [30,31]. The EEG was
analysed such as in Study 1 with slightly different filter settings (0.5 to 20 Hz bandpass). The averages
were rereferenced (average reference transformation [32]), and the reconstructed vertex reference was
added to the data, resulting in 61 EEG channels. The ergometer and its measuring equipment and the
experimental procedure were the same as in Study 1. The task was performed by two female students
(F and K, aged 24 and 26) without rowing experience and an experienced male rower (H, aged 50).
Written informed consent was obtained. Subjects rowed in a recreational mode during the oddball task
with a stroke rate of 20/min.
3.2. Results
Figure 3 displays the ERPs of all three subjects for the oddball task. As in Study 1, the VEPs were
very similar between rowing and rest, the P300 was smaller during rowing, and the intraindividual
differences were much smaller than the interindividual differences. The SNR values were always
higher for the rest condition (VEP mean at Oz: 0.315 vs. 0.135, t (2) = 11.7, p = 0.0072).
Motor-related activity, on the other hand, was not dominated by the expected motor potential
in all conditions. To reject artefacts, the Infomax ICA algorithm implemented in the Vision Analyzer
1.0 software was applied. Components containing artefactual elements were identified according
to their waveform pattern and topography. This procedure improved the data quality somewhat
but insufficiently, which was probably because movement artefacts are not stable enough over time,
which is a prerequisite for computing the ICA components. Performing only the arm pull revealed
for subject H a bilateral negativity; however, for subjects F and K, it revealed no interpretable results.
For normal rowing, a negative activation at central sites appeared, indicating a motor potential, but at
peripheral electrode sites, large activities occurred, which were only partly corrected using ICA.
One possible source for artefacts in this study were electrode movements due to cable drag because
cables were not fixed to the cap.
In summary, this pilot study revealed results similar to those of Study 1. Standard ERPs can be
measured reliably during rowing; however, motor-related activity is largely distorted by remaining
artefact sources.

4. Pilot Study 3
4.1. Introduction
Disadvantages of the two systems used in the previous pilot studies were the amount of required
equipment and the data transmission via cable connections. Therefore, a study of ref. [33] was very
promising. They used the Emotiv headset, a new developed wireless system (Emotiv, San Francisco,
CA, USA, www.emotiv.com). After making some technical improvements, they measured ERPs in
subjects walking around. The Emotiv system integrates the hardware in a small and lightweight
headset, in combination with a wireless data transmission via a USB dongle to a laptop or even an
Android smartphone [6]. Furthermore, this system integrates a two-axis gyroscope that measures head
rotations. Electrodes and cables of the Emotiv system are fixed to stiff plastic arms, which should be
effective to reduce artefacts by cable and electrode movements. Acceptable limitations of the Emotiv
system, at least for pilot studies, are the fixed and lower sample rate and resolution and the lower
number of channels (14). In addition, the sensor locations cannot be changed and are not well suited to
sensorimotor research. Comparison studies revealed that the Emotiv system (equipped with the cheap
original electrodes) performs less accurately than a medical device; however, it is able to record EEG
data in a satisfying manner [34,35]. Comparing a modified (according to ref. [33]) Emotiv System with
a commercial SynAmps System revealed only small differences, with a marginal worse performance of
the modified Emotiv System [36].
4.2. Materials and Methods
As already practised by ref. [33], an Emotiv system was modified by removing the original sensors
and plastic arms and connecting the system to the electrode cap with the gold electrodes used in Study
1 (Figure 4). A 14-channel EEG covering mainly the sensorimotor area (electrode sites AFz, Fz, FCz,
Cz, CPz, Pz, FC1, FC2, CP1, CP2, C3, C4, O1 to assess VEPs, left mastoid, and reference right mastoid)
was recorded using the Emotiv system (fixed settings: sample rate 128 Hz, resolution 14 bit/0.51 µV,

The motor-related activity showed more or less large artefacts at several sites, as well as the expected
modulation by rowing force at some other sites—that is, a larger negative activity with increasing force
during the rowing stroke—with some differences between subjects (Figure 6). As it can be difficult
to differentiate between motor-related activity and movement-related artefacts at sensorimotor sites,
movement-related artefacts can clearly be identified at sites outside the sensorimotor region. Figure 5
displays such an example for subject J at electrode site O1. The VEP for the frequent stimulus of the
oddball task was computed separately for the drive and recovery phases of the rowing movement
(stimuli presented in the drive–recovery transition were excluded for this analysis). These waveforms
were overlaid by large movement-related artefacts with reversed polarity, which cancelled each other
out in the average, including all trials. These artefacts were independent of the chosen reference (Cz,
right mastoid, and linked mastoids). That is, the overlay does not depend on physiological motor
activity, which is much stronger at Cz than at the mastoids and O1; instead, it must be generated at
electrode O1. Probably, this was due to cable artefacts in an electromagnetically noisy environment.
Furthermore, the electrodes O1, left mastoid, and AFz had the largest distance to the Emotiv connector
and therefore the longest cables, which may have allowed small movements.

5.2. Materials and Methods
The Emotiv system used in Study 3 was combined with eight active electrodes (EasyCap active),
which were provided by EasyCap GmbH (www.easycap.de) together with electrode caps (EasyCap).
In contrast to the older version of the Acticap electrodes used in Study 2, these electrodes are smaller
and very flat, and should therefore be less susceptible to tilting movements generated by inertial forces.
After pretests, electrode cables were shortened, fixed to the cap, and connected to the headset. Power for
the electrodes was provided by a 9 V battery attached to the connector (Figure 8). The electrodes were
fixed with adaptors and a highly viscous conductive paste (Elefix). The active electrodes were placed at
positions Cz, FCz, C4’, C3’, O1, left and right mastoid (TP9, TP10), focusing the measure of motor-related
activity and the VEP. The active reference electrode was placed at AFz for different reasons: (i) it could
be controlled by generating eye blinks if all electrodes worked properly; (ii) sections with eye blink
and vertical eye movement artefacts could be detected and removed from the EEG data; (iii) a mastoid
reference is largely affected by EMG artefacts generated by neck and head muscles; and (iv) the spatial
distance to occipital sites is the largest and allows measuring larger VEPs. A disposable baby-ECG
electrode, which served as ground/DRL (driven right leg), was placed at the right anterior temple.
The original passive ground electrode of the EasyCap-active system was used as a signal electrode
and placed at Oz. Of course, it is unusual to combine a passive electrode with an active reference
electrode, and it was not certain whether it would work, because the amplifier would saturate if the
impedances are very different. However, this electrode always provided a clear EEG signal, and no
saturation effects were observed in any measure. Therefore, the quality of the VEP measured with the
active electrode at O1 could be directly compared with the VEP measured with the passive electrode
at Oz. Signal quality was controlled with the Emotiv Testbench recording software. The recording
parameters (A-D rate 128 Hz, bandpass filter 0.2–45 Hz) of the ergometer, its measuring equipment,
and the oddball task were the same as in Study 3 except for two modifications. The condition with
the 60 deviant stimuli of the previous studies was removed because the VEPs did not differ from
the standard checkerboard task. Therefore, the number of trials of the latter was increased from 120
to 180. Secondly, because no VEP signal was obtained from one subject, a second recording session
was conducted at a later time (with a nearly identical rowing performance). To ensure that the visual
stimulation was observed, the target stimulus (cross) was replaced by a lower number (27–33) of
pictures of different airplanes. This was done because the oddball task was repeated six times instead
of two times in the previous studies, and therefore, more salient stimuli were used. In this Study 4,
the target condition of the oddball task was only used to control performance.
The same four male subjects as in Study 3 (aged 19, 23, 26, and 59 years, height 180–190 cm,
weight 80–84 kg) performed six experimental conditions of about 4 min duration comparable to
Study 3: (i) rowing with lower force output and lower stroke rate; (ii) lower force output, higher stroke
rate; (ii) higher force output, lower stroke rate; (iv) higher force output, higher stroke rate; (v) visual
stimulation in rest (without rowing); and (vi) rowing with arm pull only (details are provided in the
legend of Figure 9). Power and stroke rates could be controlled with the performance monitor of the
ergometer and were close to the instruction. The rowing power ranged from recreational (condition i)

to long-distance (e.g., 10 km) racing (condition iv). The visual stimulation was applied in all six
conditions. For comparison, one subject repeated all six conditions with the cap used in Study 3 with
14 passive electrodes.

starting in condition three. Therefore, for the VEP analysis, the data of all recordings were filtered
with a 1-Hz/24 dB highpass. This filtering did not visibly affect the morphology of the VEP waveform.
For the analysis of the movement-related activity, no additional highpass filtering was made because
at a stroke rate of 20/min movement, the frequency is about 0.33 Hz.

In summary, as shown in the previous studies, standard VEPs can be measured reliably during
rowing, whereas signal quality decreases when movement intensity increases. The differences between

the VEP measured at active electrode O1 and passive electrode Oz are marginal to small. This shows
that active electrodes may not reduce movement artefacts further when electrode cables are shortened
and fixated and a head-mounted amplifier is used. Consequently, the motor-related activity is still
distorted by remaining artefacts.
6. General Discussion
The present pilot studies tested the practicability of four different EEG acquisition systems for ERP
measures in moving subjects (a summary is given in Table 1). Technically, including the modifications,
the used systems were suited to measure ERPs in moving subjects in contrast to conventional laboratory
EEG hardware with passive electrodes. The advantages of the used systems were the head-mounted
amplifier (studies 1, 3, and 4) and the active electrodes (studies 2 and 4), both methods reducing cable
movement artefacts. However, as recently shown by ref. [37], increasing cable sway leads to a decrease
in SNR, even when active electrodes are used; that is, to shorten and fix cables is essential. Meanwhile,
a further advantage of available systems with low weight and small dimensions for movement research
(research on moving subjects) is either wireless data transmission or storing the data on an SD card in
the device itself.

The data from fourteen single case measures from six different subjects revealed for a standard
paradigm (visual oddball task) comparable intraindividual ERPs during rowing and during rest
(non-movement condition) in all cases, despite remaining artefacts in the data. EEG parameters and
ERP waveforms are genetically determined and show generally a broad range of interindividual
differences, but they are also remarkably stable over time in adult subjects [28,38]. This fact (although
probably not well known) strongly supports the reliability of the data, because the intraindividual
differences were much smaller than the interindividual differences. Higher intraindividual differences
instead would indicate that the ERP pattern is largely distorted by movement artefacts.
Artefacts were visibly larger in the raw data of the rowing condition(s) and quantified by
considerably lower SNR values. The use of the SNR to quantify signal quality could be further
extended. Computing the SNR from subsets of the data may inform about the minimum number of
trials necessary for an experiment and may allow comparisons between different movement classes.
Furthermore, because SNR is the relation between the power of the averaged ERP waveform and the
power of the underlying EEG (see Appendix A), these two values may be helpful to identify if the ERP
or the EEG is mainly affected by artefacts.
Whereas the VEPs were quite similar, the P300 was smaller during rowing than during rest
(studies 1–3). This may be partly due to a habituation effect (the rest condition was always performed
before the rowing condition), as recently suggested by ref. [39] as well, who used also an oddball task
to compare ERP measures during indoor cycling with a resting condition. Another contribution to this
effect was probably that multiple task demands reduce the P300 (e.g., as reviewed by ref. [40]). Here,
attention is divided by counting the targets on the one hand and performing the rowing movement

Sensors 2020, 20, 5618

16 of 21

and the monitoring of stroke rate and power output on the other hand, which may be demanding for
nonskilled rowers. Similar results with about a 30% smaller P300 amplitude during walking compared
to sitting still (in counterbalanced order) were reported by ref. [33,41], who also suggested that the
different task demands were the reason for this result. However, it has to be emphasised that the aim
of the present pilot studies was not to investigate cognitive processes in rowing; instead, these robust
ERP components (VEPs, P300) were measured for methodological reasons—that is, to compare ERP
data quality during rowing and rest in a repeated measure design.
The positive results of the oddball task, including the high intensive rowing conditions of
study 4, are promising for the investigation of brain functions in naturally behaving subjects outside
the laboratory: for example, in cognition research, brain–computer interface (BCI) applications,
ambulatory assessment, and others. Since rowing is a very athletic sport and therefore a source of
large movement-related artefacts, ERP measures with less motor activity such as walking around [33],
walking or jogging slowly on a treadmill [15,18,19], or cycling when pedaling slowly at a subaerobic
level [39] can easily be obtained using suitable equipment. Technically, non-movement related ERPs can
be measured when active electrodes are combined with laboratory recording systems [3,4,15,18,19,21,39]
or when passive electrodes are combined with head-mounted recording systems [5,22,33]. The reported
analysis of movement-related activities in walking/slow jogging [19] or cycling were related to spectral
analysis of the EEG, which is easier to assess than ERPs. Further related studies are reviewed by
ref. [20].
Due to the nature of ecological settings, more limitations compared to laboratory settings have
to be accepted. The placement of the stimulation monitor besides the ergometer and the oscillating
viewing distance may be regarded as critical. Alternatives might be the use of a head-up display or
an acoustical stimulation. However, the gyroscope data in studies 3 and 4 revealed only small head
movements in the oddball task during rowing; therefore, it can be concluded that this was comparable
in Study 1 and 2, because the placement of the monitor was the same. Eye movements were marginal
or not present in the high-density recording of Study 2 but could be monitored at frontal sites in the
other studies as well.
The (slight) differences in hardware settings, filter settings, and electrode positions were acceptable
because reliability was assessed by the within-subject comparisons for each study separately.
The small sample size of these four pilot studies may be seen as critical from a cognitive neuroscience
or psychological point of view. In those studies, mainly complex processes are investigated, which may
differ between participants, will not be present in all participants, or may interfere with other factors.
This will require a larger sample size and a statistical analysis to show if the found effects are random
or if the probability is high that the effects are real. In contrast, the present studies used a salient
visual stimulation with a full-screen reversed checkerboard. This stimulation reliably evoked a robust
electrophysiological (sensory) response that cannot be suppressed when the stimulation is observed.
The measure of VEPs is a valid test for the functioning of the visual system and a well-established tool
for clinical diagnostics in neurology and ophthalmology [42]. Furthermore, a recent study proposed,
based on ERPs measured in an oddball task, an ERP–EEG-based authentication system as an efficient
biometric tool due to its convincing results [43]. In studies investigating higher cognitive processes
(e.g., semantic processing) where an ERP component such as the N400, which is sensitive to these
processes cannot be observed, researchers can use the VEP as a tool to check if the participants paid
attention to the presented visual stimuli. This VEP, which was dominated by a negative and a positive
peak in the interval between 100 and 170 ms, was obtained during rowing and rest in all fourteen
measures, and it was therefore a valuable tool to compare signal quality between rowing and rest on
an individual level.
The second and more challenging aim of the four studies was to test if motor-related activity
could be measured. This approach is unique for these pilot studies, as the cited studies in the
introduction aimed to measure cognitive processing in movement conditions, not the movement itself.
Although motor potentials during the drive phase of the rowing movement, modulated by force output,

Sensors 2020, 20, 5618

17 of 21

were indicated (cf. Figures 6 and 9), in all four studies, large movement-related artefacts occurred,
which distorted motor-related activity. These artefacts can be identified at electrode sites apart from
the pre- and primary motor cortex. In this context, it has to be considered that artefacts originating
from the reference electrode will affect the other electrodes. As the classical mastoid reference captures
EMG activity of head and neck muscles, reference electrode positions less affected by this EMG activity,
as well as the activity of cortical motor areas, may be better suited (e.g., prefrontal sites or nose tip).
Artefacts are more difficult to detect at sites covering the motor areas because muscle force generation,
movement kinematics, and movement-related artefacts have the same time course. Therefore, further
technical improvements to reduce artefacts beforehand or to identify artefacts better [44] and correct
them are necessary to investigate motor behavior in movements including the whole body (as in sports:
for example, motor learning or differentiating high from low performance in movement execution).
One example to identify artefact sources was given in Study 3 when using the gyroscope to identify
artefacts generated by rapid head movements.
Known artefact sources are the EMG activity and sweating artefacts. The latter cannot be filtered
out when movement frequency is in the same range (as seen in one subject of Study 4). Other sources
of artefacts may rely on small movements of the electrode cables relative to the cap which were
still possible; and the translational head movement during rowing in an electromagnetically noisy
environment (the room was not shielded) may have generated small currents in the cables, as in a
generator (according to Faraday’s law). However, in both cases, the active electrodes should be less
vulnerable to this artefact sources. Furthermore, for the second case, artefacts should be larger when
movement speed increases, which was not observed.
To investigate further possible sources of motion artefacts, ref. [45] used a phantom head to
simulate motion artefacts in EEG data and found that artefacts increased with movement frequency
as well as with movement amplitude, that is, in general with the acceleration of the phantom head.
“We speculate that the major source of such artefacts is micro-movement of the recording electrodes in
relation to the scalp surface“ [45]. Their data showed that artefacts strongly increased when the head
acceleration was larger than 1.5 g. Based on these results, additional measures of head acceleration using
a triaxial acceleration sensor (Move II, Movisens GmbH, Karlsruhe/Germany, www.movisens.com)
attached to the Emotiv headset were analysed. These revealed values between 0.85 g in low-intensive
rowing (75 W, 20 strokes/min) and 2.5 g in high-intensive rowing (360 W, 30 strokes/min). That is,
the lower quality of VEPs in Study 4 at the rowing conditions with higher intensity may partly depend
on such micro-movements of the electrodes independently of whether passive or active electrodes
are used, because the main advantage of active electrodes is that these are less susceptible to cable
sway artefacts.
Another pitfall with a physiological origin might be that different neuronal activities are
superimposed, which hinders the detection of relevant activities. Ref. [23] observed that the amplitude
of the motor potential correlates very high (r = 0.93) with force output in an isometric elbow flexion
task and reported values of up to 8 µV/150 N. In rowing, these values (assuming a physiological source)
are considerably higher (about 100 µV and 1000 N in Study 4). In contrast to these efferent activities,
probably generated from the pyramidal cells in the primary motor cortex [46,47], other motor-related
activities (originating from the premotor cortex or the SMA) are very small. For example, in two of
our own visuomotor tracking studies, the effects related to motor learning were below 1 µV [12,13].
That is, if generally the activities related to motor learning or motor programming (e.g., in rowing the
perception and adaptation of within-crew differences of rowing technique [27]) are in this amplitude
range, these will be difficult to detect when the activity related to force execution is much higher.
This hypothesis could be tested comparing rowing with other movement activities with a high force
output, such as cycling on a stationary bike, which has the advantage that artefacts due to head
movements and the related electrode movements could be minimised.
As a general recommendation for future ERP studies in an intensive-movement paradigm, cyclic
movements where sub-movements (within one cycle) can be identified are advantageous. Movement

Sensors 2020, 20, 5618

kinematics and dynamics should be kept constant and can be controlled by providing feedback
continuously about key performance factors (force, power, movement speed). Alternatively, after some
training sessions to gain experience, participants should be able to control these factors intrinsically.
For tasks (e.g., cognitive tests) not directly related to the movement itself, it has to be considered that
movement intensity should be kept at the same level during the test. Furthermore, the test performance
may decrease due to non-attention when the participant fatigues because intensity is too high.
7. Conclusions
The aim of the present set of four pilot studies was to examine if and to what extend of movement
intensity ERPs could be measured in moving subjects. The two main questions were as follows.
(i) Can ERPs not related to the movement be measured, i.e., to investigate cognitive processes in
ecological settings? (ii) Can movement-related ERPs be measured to investigate neuronal processes
e.g., associated with motor learning and motor control? Meanwhile, several other studies showed that
ERPs related to cognitive processing can be measured when subjects are moving with lower intensity.
The present study used a rowing task—a very athletic movement pattern with extensive head and
body accelerations—that can be performed from a lower to a very high intensity. ERP signal quality
(respectively the deterioration of the ERP) was assessed by comparing ERPs generated during resting
and rowing. A salient visual checkerboard stimulation was used, which has the advantage of reliably
evoking neuronal responses in the visual cortex (VEP) of healthy subjects. Additionally, in studies
one to three, a P300 was measured which is easily detectable in most individuals. The results of all
studies revealed that ERPs can be measured during rowing when the stimulation is not synchronised
to the movement pattern, even when movement intensity (force and speed) was increased in study
four, although the signal quality (SNR) decreased. This is a promising result for the investigation
of cognitive or attentional processes (e.g., cycling in public traffic) in moving subjects. However,
investigating higher cognitive functions (e.g., modulating N400 effects in language processing [48])
will require probably much higher sample sizes and an enlarged stimulus material than in typical
laboratory settings.
In contrast, the second aim was not reached—that is, to measure movement-related neuronal
activity in sufficient quality. Although we tried to implement technical improvements based on
the results of the preceding studies, signal quality remained poor, and further research is required.
Comparing the equipment used in the four studies, a wireless headset combined with active electrodes
is recommended because it reduces artefacts generated by cable movements and allows full mobility.

Appendix A
Description of the computation of the SNR in the BrainVision Analyzer User Manual
(Software Version 2.1.1):
The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a measure of the quality of the EEG signal. Since there is no
exact information available on either the signal or the noise in the EEG, their average total powers
must be estimated statistically.
The average noise power of the EEG is first calculated for each channel. It is assumed that
averaging eliminates the noise. For this reason, each EEG value in the original dataset is assigned the
average value corresponding to its time position. Then, the square of the difference between the EEG
value and the assigned average value is used as an estimated value for the noise power for each point.

The average noise power of each EEG channel is determined by calculating the sum of the
estimated values for each point across all the data points of the channel in the original dataset and
dividing the result by the number of points minus 1.
In order to ascertain the average power of the signal in the EEG, you first calculate the total power
of a channel of the EEG. The total power is obtained by calculating the mean of the squares for all data
points of the channel before averaging.
It can be assumed that the signal and noise are uncorrelated. Consequently, the average power of
the signal is equal to the difference between the average total power and the average noise power.
The SNR is calculated from the quotient of the average signal power and the average noise power.
