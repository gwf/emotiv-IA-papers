Systems, datasets are stored in the Dali File System as tabular
records, where each record corresponds to a row and the
computation is implicitly parallel.
1) Architecture: HPCC Systems includes the Thor and
Roxie [4] clusters, as well as common middleware components. It also includes an external communications layer and
client interfaces that provide both end-user services and system
management tools. The auxiliary components support monitoring and facilitate loading and storing of ﬁle system data
from external sources. Fig. 1 illustrates the overall software
architecture of the HPCC Systems environment. It includes
system conﬁgurations to support both high-performance online
query applications using indexed data ﬁles (Roxie) and parallel
batch data processing (Thor) as shown in Fig. 2.
The computing engine Thor has a master-slave architecture
as shown in Fig 3. Each physical Thor node is capable
to run multiple processes to offer ﬂexible conﬁguration. A
Roxie cluster is capable of high-performance online processing
that can efﬁciently execute multiple queries in parallel. It
is similar in its function to Hadoop with HBase and Hive
capabilities added. Both Thor and Roxie clusters utilize the
same programming language ECL to implement applications,
which can lead to higher programmer productivity.

B. KMeans Clustering Algorithm
Machine learning algorithms can be roughly categorized
into two types based on their requirement for training data:
supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Unsupervised
learning is comprised of machine learning algorithms that do
not require labeled training data. Within the unsupervised category, KMeans is one of the most popular clustering algorithms
and is extensively used in the academia and industry to develop
scientiﬁc and industrial applications [6]. KMeans has been
widely used in many different ﬁelds, including education [7],
agriculture [8], fraud detection [9], public transportation [10],
IoT management [11].
KMeans groups an unlabeled dataset of p observations into
a predeﬁned K number of clusters, so that the resulting
clusters have high intra-cluster similarity. If centroids are
m1 , m2 , ...mk , and partitions are c1 , c2 , ...ck , then one can
calculate the inertia of KMeans as:
K 

Fig. 4. Dataﬂow Graph of HPCC Systems

To initiate the clustering process, the KMeans algorithm
takes the number of clusters K and the initial position of the
centroids (the center of each cluster) as model parameters. The
initial centroids can be randomly chosen or identiﬁed using
optimization methods to ﬁnd better initial centroids, such as
what is done in K-means++ [12].
After initialization, the KMeans model starts an iterative
process which keeps updating the position of the centroids and
their associations with the observations. There are two major
steps in the iterative process: assignment step and update step.
With a set of k centroids (μ), the assignment steps ﬁrst
calculates the distances from each observation to each centroid
via Euclidean Distance [1]. All observations p are assigned to
their nearest centroid as described by [13]. The observations
assigned to the same centroids are regarded as a cluster (see
equation 2).

in ECL-Watch as shown in Fig. 4, where edges represent the
data traversal across these activities. The graph is displayed
for the user via the ECL-Watch interface.

3) Performance Monitor: In HPCC Systems, as a side
effect, the ECL compiler will generate a full execution plan
rendered as a visual dataﬂow graph, accessible through the
ECL-Watch management web tool after an ECL program is
submitted . This visual dataﬂow graph plays an important
role to help optimize the Big Data applications on the HPCC
Systems platform.
In HPCC Systems, you can gain a better understanding of
the use of resources and the activities such as those take the
longest by leveraging the detailed timing information (see Fig.
5) in ECL-Watch. In addition to accessing the visual execution
plans, ECL-Watch provides this timing information to direct
the optimization work to those areas that can provide the
biggest amount of beneﬁt with the least amount of effort. Our
work utilizes the built-in ECL distributed computing jobs and
the dataﬂow graph in ECL-watch to optimize Big Data jobs
in HPCC Systems.

The next step is the update step. The centroids are updated
or repositioned by calculating the new mean of the assigned
observations, which is the mean of the least squared Euclidean
distance (see equation 3).

observations remain at the assigned centroids and therefore the
centroids would not be updated anymore.
In practice, a maximum number of iterations and a converge
rate or tolerance are deﬁned to avoid an indeﬁnite number
of iterations and unnecessary computations. In this case, the
KMeans algorithm will stop iterating once it reaches the
maximum number of iterations or the movement distance of
each center is smaller than the tolerance.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II
provides the related works on the scalable KMeans algorithm.
In Section III, we demonstrate our approach to implementing
a massively scalable parallel KMeans algorithm on the HPCC
Systems platform. Section IV introduces the experimental environment and experiment results. Section V is the conclusion

instead of parallelizing KMeans in Hadoop Mapredcue framework.
IV. A PPROACH
To maximize the parallelization and minimize the inter-node
communication, our key approach to implementing a highly
scalable KMeans on HPCC Systems uses data parallelism. We
also show how features of HPCC Systems can be leveraged
during speciﬁc training phases by allowing it to train different
models concurrently on very large datasets on commodity
hardware.
1) Data Parallelism Method: The KMeans algorithm
groups p observations into K clusters by iteratively updating
the centers until convergence.
At each iteration, the computation performs two types of
distance calculations: the distance between each observation
to each center and the distance movement of each center
compared to the last iteration. The computation cost of these
two types of distance calculation are O(nkd) and O(kd)
respectively, where n is the number of observations, k is the
number of cluster and d is the dimensions of the clustering
space.
In general, the distance calculations between each observation and each center are more expensive than the distance
calculations for the movement of the centers. For Big Data applications in particular, the distance calculation between each
observation and each center is signiﬁcantly more expensive
due to the number of observations n being much bigger than
k and d.
Based on above analysis, our algorithm design aims to

use Data
Parallelism to maximize the parallelization of the
distance computations between observations and centroids and
minimize the inter-node communication as much as possible.

III. R ELATED W ORKS
Most of the traditional clustering [1] [14] [15] algorithms
are designed for centralized computation environments. As
data sizes become larger, traditional clustering methods are
challenged. To meet this challenge, parallel and distributed
clustering algorithms have been implemented, such as [16]
[17] [18]. In this session, we introduce some of the parallel
and distributed KMeans implementations described in the
literature.
One type of parallel Kmeans is an approximation of the
original KMeans. For example, [19] introduces a distributed
KMeans clustering algorithm based on distributed coreset
construction to approximate the original KMeans. [20] is also
an approximation solution which further proceed the work of
[19]. It proposed a distributed Principal component analysis
[21] algorithm to cluster the data in a projected space. Other
variances of parallel KMeans have been published as well
such as the parallel fuzzy KMeans [22] and privacy preserving
parallel KMeans [23].
Another type of parallel KMeans pursue the exact result
as the original KMeans. Our work belongs to this category.
some works in this category utilize the traditional CPU-based
computers such as [16] [24] [17]. Some works take avantage of
the invention of Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) and the use of
GPUs in general computing problems (GPGPU). For example,
[25] [26] [27] [28] utilize the shared-memory computing
structure and high performance GPUs to implement parallel
KMeans.
In addition, scalable implementations of KMeans are available using High Performance Computing (HPC). For example,
[29] implements high performance KMeans using Message
Passing Interface (MPI) in an HPC distributed computing
environment. Other research such as [30] [31] shows scalable
implementations based on different distributed frameworks and
platforms.
In this paper, we present a massively scalable parallel
KMeans implementation to cluster very large datasets on
the HPCC Systems platform. There are some works focused
on implementing the KMeans algorithm to cluster massive
datasets such as [32] [33]. [34] is very close to our work

Our implementation of the KMeans algorithm calculates all
the distances locally via embarrassing parallelism. Most of
the assignment and update steps are also executed in parallel,
except the global update of the centers. The pseudocode of

As we can see from the pseudocode, the observations are
ﬁrst evenly distributed to each node. Then the centers are
broadcast to each node so that each node has a full copy
of all the centers. This step initiates the data parallelism and
allows the following steps to be locally calculated without
any communication cost, until the global update of the centers.
Note that in Step 4, the observations closest to the same center
are grouped as a cluster or a group. In other words, they are all
members of the same cluster. In Step 5, the value of centers are
locally updated by summing up the values of the local cluster
members. Since the members of each cluster can be located
in different nodes, the local value of each center needs to sum
up and update globally as shown in Step 7 for the accurate
ﬁnal result to go into the next iteration if not converged.

In HPCC Systems, datasets are stored in the Dali File
System as records, where each record corresponds to a row.
The computation on HPCC Systems is not only implicitly
parallel but also allows users to explicitly control the data
distribution and customize the distribution methods, such as
broadcasting or gathering.

HPCC Systems enables the execution of a large number
of models simultaneously on different datasets, leveraging the
Myriad Interface and computing framework of HPCC Systems.
The Myriad Interface allows a user to perform multiple independent machine learning activities within a single interface
invocation [36]. The pseudocode of the massively Scalable
Parallel KMeans algorithm on HPCC Systems platform is as
shown in Algorithm 2.

To implement the presented KMeans, we utilize both the
implicit and explicit parallelism on HPCC Systems. For example, to distribute the observations evenly on each node
and broadcast the centers, we use explicit distribution. As a
result of this explicit distribution, the closest center of each
observation can be calculated and assigned locally and the
values of each center can be partially updated locally, as well.
The ﬁnal step is to globally update the value of each center
by gathering the local value of each center.

The model inputs of Algorithm2 are different from
Algorithm1: different groups of observations and different
groups of centers instead of a single group of observations
and a single group of centers. With the help of the machine
learning dataframe of HPCC Systems, we are able to map
datasets with its centers in different groups.
3) Combining Data Parallelism and Model Parallelism:
The implemented KMeans algorithm adopts both data parallelism and model parallelism to enable KMeans calculations
on massive datasets and also with a large count of hyperparameters. In this section, we introduce the methods that we
use to realize this hybrid parallelism in HPCC Systems.

2) Notes on Model Parallelism in HPCC Systems: In addition to the scalability to support clustering of massive datasets,
the presented work also enables model parallelism, that is,
the ability to run massive number of models simultaneously,
leveraging the programming model of HPCC Systems. Model
parallelism is when each replica trains over the same or
different data but uses different part of the model [35]. Model
parallelism also allows for large number of models to run
efﬁciently in parallel to save modeling time.

HPCC Systems is a Big Data processing platform with
implicit parallel computing. It also allows users to control the

data distribution method explicitly via the Distribute
function
by specifying the methods in its expression. This is the key
function to realize data parallelism. Further more, the machine
learning library of HPCC Systems provide core dataframes
such as the ’AnyField’ dataframe, which are essential to realize
the myriad interface or model parallelism.
Thus, in HPCC Systems the hybrid parallelism can be
realized by utilizing the ﬂexible data distribution control and
Myriad Interface. As seen in the base dataframe 1, each data
record is assigned a model identiﬁer(wi) and an observation

identiﬁer(id). Based on these two identiﬁers, the Distribute
function can distribute the data based on the wi and id of
each record, allowing data and model parallelism in HPCC
Systems.

Model parallelism is essential for Big Data because the
training process of Big Data applications usually takes hours or
even days. Imagine needing to run a model on 10,000 different
datasets with 10,000 different hyperparameters. This would
need a total of 100,000,000 models to run sequentially.

Fig. 7. Single Node Conﬁguration Runs Show Out of Memory Compared to
Runtimes on Various-Sized Clusters (Time in Seconds, Iris dataset)

V. E XPERIMENT E NVIRONMENT AND R ESULTS

conﬁguration runs out of memory when the data size
increases to 7,500,000 records as we can see in Fig. 7.
2) As the data sizes increase, the runtime of the single node
and 4 nodes conﬁgurations increase rapidly. In contrast,
the 20, 25 and 400 nodes conﬁgurations show good
scalability with much less run time and lower run time
increase rate as show in Fig. 6.
If we remove single and four-node conﬁgurations from the
graph, the results are as shown in Fig. 8. We can see that
all nodes scale reasonably well and 400 nodes eventually
outperform other clusters when the data is large enough.

To evaluate the performance of the Scalable Parallel
KMeans on HPCC Systems platform, experiments are conducted on various clusters with different number of nodes. The
version of HPCC Systems for performance evaluation is 6.4.0.
The size of different clusters are 1 node, 4 nodes, 20 nodes, 25
nodes and 400 nodes, each of which has 2 x Intel(R) Xeon(R),
2.10GHz, 8 cores, 8GB memory, 140GB Micron 5100 SSD
and 5Gbps network adapters.
Our experimental data is the public Iris ﬂower dataset [37],
which is widely used in the ﬁelds of data mining, machine
learning, and clustering. The original Iris dataset has 150
records and ﬁve attributes. To evaluate the accuracy and
scalability of the presented work, the original Iris dataset
is replicated to increase the data volume. As a result, the
experimental data sizes range from 150 records to 600,000,000
records. We also apply our method to a second test dataset,
the public CoverType dataset, which is obtained from [38]. In
the CoverType dataset each record represents the cartographic
data for one plot of Rocky Mountain forest. The dataset has
54 attributes and 500 million records.

Fig. 8. KMeans Runtime on Larger Cluster, Iris dataset

To further evaluate the performance of our method, we
conduct experiments on massive datasets, as shown in Fig.
9. The record count ranges from 15,000,000 to 600,000,000.
The testing clusters have 4, 20 and 400 nodes respectively.
Fig. 10 shows that the 400-node cluster conﬁguration has
the best performance for all massive datasets. As data sizes
increase, the 400-node cluster conﬁguration has outstanding
performance as compared to the smaller cluster conﬁgurations,
with a lower run time increase rate as shown in Fig. 9.
We validate the accuracy of our approach by comparing
the results of clustering experimental data to the KMeans
implementation in scikit-learn [39]. The comparison shows
that the output of the methods is the same.
To further demonstrate the scalabiliy of the presented work,
another set of experiments are conducted with the CoverType
dataset with higher dimensions. We randomly sampled 5,000
records as base dataset and test the scalability as the same
manner as testing Iris dataset. The result also shows impressive
scalability as seen in Fig. 11.

Fig. 6. KMeans Experimental results, Iris dataset

The performance of the KMeans implementation is shown
in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. From the results we can see that:
1) The single node conﬁguration shows better performance
only when the data size is less than 150,000 records.
When the data size is too small, other conﬁgurations’
performance is heavily affect by the communication
overhead. However, when the data size is larger than
150,000 records, all of the conﬁgurations outperform
the single node conﬁguration. Moreover, the single node

In future work we will ﬁrst explore optimization of the
positions of the initial centroids. The current implementation
does not consider optimal starting positions. Secondly, we will
study the performance on additional types of datasets and on
additional sizes of clusters.

VI. C ONCLUSIONS
To tackle the challenge of clustering big datasets we present
a massively scalable parallel KMeans method that leverages
the distributed computing environment of the HPCC Systems
platform. Our key contribution is to leverage data parallelism
in the distributed environment and an efﬁcient method for
global update of KMeans centroids. We also call out the
model parallelism available in HPCC Systems. We report
the performance of the implementation on a large range of
dataset sizes on several clusters with different node counts. The
experimental results show that massive datasets that cannot
be processed on a single node environment can be processed
effectively in parallel using a distributed cluster. The results
show signiﬁcant speedup and scalability up to a cluster of size
400 nodes on a dataset of 600,000,000 records.

Abstract—Efficient post disaster management is
imperative to deal with the havoc a disaster creates.
Providing the disaster response agencies with the
necessary tools and advanced technologies could
accelerate the process of rescuing people in affected
areas and providing them with the necessary assistance.
Social media provides NGOs, individuals, etc., a
platform to reach out to people in other parts,
expressing the needs of the affected people. Using social
media data, the disaster response agencies could gather
all the immediate needs of the people. The solution
proposed makes use of satellite imagery and social
media data to assist the disaster response agencies. The
system is capable of tracing usable roads in flooded
areas and distinguishes areas based on the extent of
damage using satellite imagery, and analyzing areas
where people could be stranded and identifying items of
need using social media data. Tracing of usable roads
has been carried out using maximum number of
connected pixels concept. Distinguishing areas based on
extent of damage is carried by comparing pre and post
disaster satellite images. For analyzing items of need
and identifying locations of stranded people, Twitter
data was filtered based on certain keywords. It’s an allin-one solution, which could be used by response
agencies to gather real time information about the onground situation.

Abstract - Big data applications have become an
integral part of many intelligent systems, enabling
better business decision making, by extracting useful
information from historical data. This involves a large
amount of computational tasks and algorithms. In such
scenarios, the time taken by the processing become an
important concern, and needs to be optimized.
Apache Spark is a high speed big data analytics engine,
best known for its fast computation speeds, due to the
use of in-memory data structures and its efficient
schedulers. Further optimization to enhance the speed
of Spark jobs will be valuable. In this paper, the
efficiencies of the four standard schedulers of Apache
Spark i.e., Standalone Scheduler, Mesos, YARN(Yet
Another Resource Negotiator) and the recently
introduced Kubernetes Scheduler are compared. The
speeds of these schedulers are compared for jobs of
different sizes, and the best alternative is identified.
Index Terms - Apache Spark, Kubernetes, YARN,
Mesos, Big Data, Schedulers

Abstract—Traditionally wired keyboard and mouse were used as
inputting devices to the computer system. These models had
many drawbacks like hardware bulkiness and inefficiency due to
delay. In this paper the new proposed system will input data
using hand recognition and motion analysis. Webcam is used as
the primary device to capture the hand gesture. These images are
preprocessed to remove noise and for bit reduction. After the
image preprocessing feature extraction and segmentation are
done. CNN algorithms are used for object detection by
identifying the features of the hand. For the system to identify the
gesture, a number of images are used for training the system.
This process is known as Features training. Once the features
and the gestures are recognized, it is mapped to a particular
function of the mouse and keyboard. 

Abstract--India is a land of agriculture. More than 70%
of the population is involved directly or indirectly in crop
production activities. This sector contributes to the Indian
economy a great deal. It contributes over 17% of the total
Gross Domestic Product (GDP). With the introduction of
newer seed varieties, new methods of agriculture, and the
use of efficient fertilizers, crop production has increased. But
without using the smarter methods, the agricultural domain
still remains in the backlogs. The conventional method
involves a lot of human instincts which at times fail. And
thus there is a need for a smarter way of crop production
using Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning
techniques. The proposed system is a smart agriculture
management system (SAMS) which is automated to help
farmers to increase the crop production. The system also
helps in reduction of resource wastage by adopting a
technique called precision agriculture. The system uses
different sensors for data acquisition to measure various
environmental factors which are required for crop
production. The data obtained from these sensors is
visualized in the form of graphs.

Abstract—Image processing has made huge progress in
recent times and has captured the attention of the
international research community in recent times. In this
survey paper the winning Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) architectures of the popular ImageNet Large Scale
Visual Recognition Competition (ILSVRC) competition
along with the innovations they introduced are discussed
in detail. CNNs to the likes of the ZFNet, Inception V1,
V2, V3 and V4 versions, ResNet versions, Inception
ResNet versions, VGG versions are all covered. Also
object detection is looked at as a preeminent task and
popular models like RCNN, Fast RCNN, Faster RCNN
and the YOLO versions along with their award winning
architectures are discussed. Text classification is another
major practice that is followed before making business
decisions. In this survey paper section III explains the text
classification techniques. preprocessing techniques such as
removing stop words, stemming, lemmatization. Two
variants of vectorization method such as vectorizationdelta, vectorization-center. paper also explains the
hyperparameter tuning for optimization of support vector
machine(SVM),
Logistic
regression(LR),
random
forest(RF) and Boosted Regression Tree (BRT). Explored
fine tuning parameter which enhance the performance of
machine learning models.

Abstract— Time series data refers to data points that follow a
chronological sequence or ordering. Modelling and analysis of
such data is generally done to extract significant statistics and
also to utilize the past historic data in order to predict
future points. In this paper, three popular time series
forecasting methods, namely Holt Winters, ARIMA and LSTMs,
are applied on CPU data and their results are compared. LSTM
is found to be more suited for predicting CPU usage followed
by ARIMA. LSTM performs better due to the fact that CPU
usage is unstable and has fluctuations even though it is
seasonal in nature. By performing such an analysis, it is
possible to identify patterns which help in predicting the usage
of future resources for future demand which in turn enables
optimization of resource management.
Keywords— Time Series Forecasting, Holt Winters, ARIMA,
LSTM, CPU Usage

Abstract—Noninvasive brain-computer interface (BCI) uses
data from electroencephalographic (EEG) sensors to train a
model using machine learning and pattern detection
algorithms to recognize certain patterns. These patterns
correspond to a command to an actuator like wheels of a
wheelchair, keyboard or mouse. Virtual reality is used to make
a virtual environment (VE) where the users can control virtual
objects. BCI generated commands can be used to control the
virtual objects with a suitable interface. Unity 3D software
provides the interface and the VE. The noninvasive nature of
input collection makes the input prone to noise and error. The
user needs considerable amount of training to learn to control
the wheelchair efficiently. This training is done in a VE where
the user controls a virtual wheelchair. The accuracy of
wheelchair control before and after training in the VE is
compared. It is observed that the user can control the physical
wheelchair with better accuracy after training in the VE.
Keywords—Brain-computer interface, virtual reality, Emotiv
BCI, Unity 3D, electrical wheelchair.

Abstract-Machine learning algorithms are nothing
but programs in computes that try to forecast the
decisions based on data driven assignment. In
diagnosis of cancer the goal is to trained algorithm of
machine learning that awards the appearance levels
from cancer patient, can precisely predict what type
and harshness of cancer they have. Breast cancer is
the most delicate and deadly among all of the diseases
in medicine. In this paper breast cancer classification
is implemented using Find-S and Candidate
elimination algorithm. These algorithms are used for
the breast cancer detection. Navie Bayes Classifier is
used for classification of breast cancer.

$EVWUDFW²Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) is a next generation
of wireless communication technology for efficient spectrum
utilization. A cognitive Radio (CR) is able to recognize the idle
spectrum. It solves the problem of spectrum scarcity in CRN.
Due to intermittent channel usage by Primary Users (PUs), it is
difficult to perform routing task in CRN. We are proposing a
solution for optimal channel selection and routing in Cognitive
Radio Network. Due to uncertainty in the number of active
users, Monte Carlo method is performed for probabilistic
outcome. During spectrum access process, Reinforcement
Learning (RL) is applied to select best frequency band for
routing. From the Simulation results, it is observed that the
proposed routing protocol outperform in terms of throughput,
packet delivery ratio, delay, dropping ratio & jitter compared
to the routing protocol without machine learning assisted
routing decision.

Abstract—In our day-to-day life we all extensively use location

based services to ¿nd out where we are located on this planet. This
can be done with the help of a GPS receiver. There are several top
notch companies vying against one another to become Master in a
a ¿eld of global positioning. A good GPS receiver must be able to
obtain quick location ¿xes. This project proposes a solution to
reduce TTFF (Time to First Fix) and obtain quick position ¿xes.
It also provides a platform to ensure proper functioning of the
GNSS solution and to perform system level testing. This project
involves the development of two tools- a command line application
(RVT) and a graphical use interface (RSDT) to ensure that the
GNSS(Global Navigation Satellite System) solution provides
quick and accurate position ¿xes. Both tools are developed using
Visual Studio 2012 and is coded in C++ language.
Keywords—Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), TTFF, RVT,

$EVWUDFW² Data security is a critical aspect in this digital world.
Data security algorithms are designed to suit specific applications.
Electronic Health Records (EHR) are the digital documents that
contain the digital data of the patients. The data includes personal
information of the patient along with the medical and treatment
histories. The radiology images and medical information is also
contained in the digital form in the EHRs. This data is usually
stored in the cloud servers because of the data storage issues. The
common practice is that the data is divided into multiple segments
and stored in different cloud servers. The issue of reconstruction
using searchable metrics is the problem that is addressed in this
paper using a novel hybrid algorithm. The personal data of the
patient is preserved using the k-Nearest Neighbor classification
algorithm to secure the data. The proposed method is novel and
works in different stages. The results are analyzed and the future
scope discussed.
Index Terms—Data security, Electronic Health Records
(EHR), Cloud servers, Encryption.

Abstract— Today 2D X-Ray Images are an integral part of
immediate medical centers and hospitals. They play an
important role in diagnosis and treatment planning in
orthopedics. This technique is globally available and is
considered as fast and inexpensive in contrast to more
advanced 3D imaging methods like CT (Computerised
Tomography) Scan and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
Scan. The doctors use these methods to take photographs of the
patient’s body by placing a photographic film behind the body,
with the X-Ray machine turned on. These rays take longer to
pass through the bones in comparison to the skin that is why
bones appear much lighter. The musculoskeletal analysis is by
nature 3D, therefore, accurate assessment of a patient’s
anatomy is widely dependent upon a surgeon’s ability to
analyze the 2D images and make assumptions from the data
available. To overcome the limitations of the surgeons
understanding and for effective planning of surgical
involvement.The goal of this project is the 3D reconstruction of
images from 2D X-Ray images. Thus, in this paper,we have
proposed a approach using machine learning for conversion
which is independent of the experiment setup. First, Bone
extraction from the image was done. Secondly, the 3D image
has been obtained using stl conversion. At last the data are
validated using patient data.

$EVWUDFW² Image classification has become easier with
deep learning and availability of larger datasets and
computational resources. The Convolutional neural network is
the most popular and widely used image classification
technique in the recent days. In this paper image classification
is performed on Indian food dataset using different transfer
learning techniques. The food plays important role in human’s
life as it provides us different nutrients and hence it is
necessary for every individual to keep a watch on their eating
habits. Therefore, food classification is a quintessential thing
for a healthier life style. Unlike the traditional methods of
building a model from the scratch, pre trained models are used
in this project which saves the computation time and cost and
also has given better results. The Indian food dataset of 20
classes with 500 images in each class is used for training and
validating. The models used are IncceptionV3, VGG16,
VGG19 and ResNet. After experimentation it was found that
Google InceptionV3 outperformed other models with an
accuracy of 87.9% and loss rate of 0.5893.

Abstract²We all know that in an environment which is
highly polluted. Latest survey report by World Health
Organization says 9 out of 10 people are affected by air
pollution and it also reveals that 7 million people die every year
due to air pollution which is affecting human health leading to
respiratory infections and diseases such as lung cancer, heart
problems and stroke. The presence of various toxic
elements(pollutants) in the air such as CO2, SO2, NO2, CO,
Particulate Matter(PM), Lead and Mercury, Ammonia, pongs
from Garbage (Solid waste), Sewage and industrial processes
has made our lives very miserable. We have very few
researchers contributing to solid waste garbage monitoring
and hence this research paper focuses on one of the
contributors of Air Pollution i, e solid waste garbage which is
being produced in higher rates in crowded cities. It is one of
the challenges we are facing on daily basis. The research paper
aims at providing a cloud based solution to monitor and
process solid waste garbage odor in crowded cities. The
proposed architecture helps in collecting the data from
garbage locations through sensors and processes the data
collected using AWS Kinesis. AWS Kinesis is one of the AWS
Services which helps us to know the quantity of various
pollutants in the solid waste garbage when they are burnt
contributing to air pollution.

Abstract— With the drastic growth in the addition of smart
objects into the Internet, it has led to many challenges like
standardizing the infrastructure, ensuring communication
security and keeping user credential private. As these devices
are having less resources it is necessity to have a lighter
encryption and authentication schemes to ensure data integrity
and user privacy. This work concentrates on evaluating the
faster hashing function used for elliptic curve digital signature
algorithm (ECDSA) that enables user authentication.
Traditionally, SHA hash functions are used in various public
key cryptography and applications. But SHA has 80 different
iterations that consumes smart device’s energy. Thus a lighter
hash function called BLAKE2 based hashing is used to
compare the time efficiency of ECDSA. BLAKE2 uses 8 rounds
of permutations and combinations to produce the
message digest of 256/512bits. This reduction in computation
has attracted researchers to use BLAKE2 hashing functions
for various applications. Thence this study concentrates on
comparison of the time efficiency under ECDSA based digital
signature for different message sizes and hashing functions.
Through various experiments conducted on different operating
systems, BLAKE2 has shown better computational efficiency
than SHA family of hashing functions for ECDSA based
scheme on different operating system.

Abstract—An earthquake is a natural disaster known on
account of the devastating effect it has on naturally occurring
structures and manmade structures such as buildings,
bungalows and residential locations to name a few.
Earthquakes are measured using seismometers, that detect the
vibrations due to seismic waves travelling through the earth’s
crust. In this work, the damage that is caused by an
earthquake was classified into damage grades, ranging in
values from one to five. A previously acquired data set was
used, wherein a series of parameters were taken into
consideration to predict the damage grade of a given building,
which is associated with a Unique Identification String. The
prediction was done using a survey of existing machine
learning classifier algorithms. The machine learning
algorithms used in this work were Logistic Regression, Naive
Bayes Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and K-Nearest
Neighbors. Based on an evaluation of a set of attributes, the
most appropriate algorithm was considered. A detailed
analysis was done on the predicted attribute by the given
algorithm, followed by data analysis that provided details that
could help mitigate the impact of an earthquake in future.

casualties ward-by-ward in a district are taken into account.
This enables distribution of relief forces proportionately
ward-wise and its prioritization based on the extent of
damage.

Keywords—predictive analysis, Logistic Regression, KNearest Neighbors, Random Forest Classifier, Naive Bayes
Classifier, Machine Learning.

The prediction of earthquake damage was done using
Fuzzy Analysis [5]. It used a parameter called the Seismic
Damage Index as a measure of the damage. Other impact
factors and modified index were considered to calculate the
average damage index.

Models of this kind can help save as many lives as
quickly as possible and turn out to be an efficient and costeffective solution. It can be further improved by the
inclusion of distribution of resources like food, clothes,
medical, monetary supplies based on the extent of human
casualties and the damage incurred by the various structures.
II. LITERATURE SURVEY
Damage prediction due to earthquakes and other natural
calamities is a field of predictive analysis that is gaining a
lot of traction in recent times. A lot of research is being
done in this field, as a result of which manifold approaches
to predict damage on account of earthquakes have been
worked upon and developed.

I. INTRODUCTION
An earthquake is a calamitous occurrence that is
detrimental to human interest and has an undesirable impact
on the environment. Earthquakes have always caused
incalculable damage to structures and properties and caused
the deaths of millions of people throughout the world. In
order to minimize the impact of such an event, several
national, international and transnational organizations take
various disaster detection and prevention measures. Time
and quantity of the organization’s resources are limiting
factors, and organization managers face several difficulties
when it comes to the distribution of the resources.

Another perspective to Earthquake damage prediction
was done using Artificial Neural Networks [12]. This
approach dealt with predicting seismic damage done to
multi storied buildings by combining Geographic
Information Systems and Artificial Neural Networks. A
value known as peak acceleration value was utilized to
perform the desired computation. Earthquake intensity was
another measure that was considered in this given
hypothesis.
A second neural network approach to damage prediction
dealt with the use of NNARX model which is an improved
version of the NARX type of Artificial Neural networks
[13]. The input and output parameters dealt with real-time
data. Although, this model was implemented in order to
predict floods, it can be utilized to predict damage due to
other natural disasters on retrieval of relevant data. The
study was done with respect to the city of Kuala Lumpur in
particular.

Leveraging the power of machine learning is a viable
option to predict the degree of damage that is done to
buildings post an earthquake. It can help identify safe and
unsafe buildings which helps to predict damage prone areas
and thus avoiding death and injuries resulting from the
aftershock of an earthquake, while simultaneously making
rescue efforts efficient.
This is done by classifying these structures on a damage
grade scale based on various factors like its age, foundation,
number of floors, material used and several other
parameters. Then the number of families and the probable

Damage prediction was also performed as a two stage
process [14]. The first step involved a simple linear
regression model, and a neural networks based model in the

second step. The model was used to predict damage due to
typhoons. The model enabled the prediction of the number
of damage distribution poles and lines from the weather
forecasts of a typhoon. The prediction was done in every
district of the Kagoshima Prefecture.

number of floors in the building recorded pre and post the
earthquake, age of the building in years, plinth area of the
building (in square feet), height of the building before and
after the earthquake (in feet).
Some of the non structural string factors considered are:
surface condition of the land on which the building was
built, type of foundation used in the building, type of roof
used in the building, type of the ground floor used in the
building, type of construction used in other floors (except
ground floor and roof), position of the building, building
plan configuration, actual condition of the building after the
earthquake.

The approaches mentioned above, dealt with earthquake
(or other natural disasters) damage prediction. There are,
however, few similar approaches to predict an earthquake
itself, or its attributes like the magnitude of the earthquake,
time of the earthquake etc. Earthquake prediction was done
using Data Analytics, with the help of a map reduce model
that was used to locate places with maximum tremors [1]. It
was also done with the help of Artificial Neural networks
[2], and a Back propagation neural network [3]. The latter
was used to determine the magnitude of an earthquake,
while the former dealt with the impact of an earthquake. A
final approach used weighted factor coefficients to
determine the probability of an earthquake [4].

The non-structural boolean value i.e. true-false value
factors are: whether the building was used for any secondary
purpose such as agricultural, hotel, rental, institutional,
school, industrial, health post, government office, police
station; whether the building superstructure type used
materials such as adobe - mud, mud mortar – stone, cement
mortar – stone, mud mortar – brick, timber, bamboo, RC
(non-engineered), RC (engineered).

III. DATA DESCRIPTION
As shown in the below diagram, the process of obtaining
and defining the data is mainly composed of three essential
steps: Data Sourcing, Damage State determination and
determining the State Variables.

The above mentioned variables contributed to the
necessary parameters that were considered as the attributes
for the respective tables in the dataset.
IV. METHODOLOGY
This covers the technique and flow of events that were
used to perform the prediction process. The prediction
methodology itself is composed of three integral steps: data
preprocessing, model selection and the final prediction
process.

Fig. 1. Flow diagram of the data description step

A. Data Source
The dataset has been fetched from [9]. The dataset
includes 4 files, namely the train dataset (used to train the
machine learning model), the test dataset (used to test the
trained machine learning mode), the file with data about
ownership and use case of the building and the file that
contains data with respect to the structure and materials of
the buildings. The dataset was found to have a total of
1,038,900 records, with the number of records in the test
dataset being 421,175, while that of the train dataset was
617,725. The training data and the test data percentages has
been observed to be 59.46% and 40.54% (approximated to
60% and 40% respectively).

Fig. 2. Flow diagram of the methodology step

A. Preprocessing
In the dataset, a building was uniquely identified by 4
attributes: Building Identification, District Identification,
Municipality Identification, Ward Identification. These
attributes were added to the training data for identifying the
building damage grade.

The extent of damage caused by the earthquake to the
buildings was classified from Grade 1 (least damage) to
Grade 5 (maximum damage) based on the survey studies
and evaluation conducted by appropriate agencies. The
primary task was to grade the extent of damage that would
likely be caused by an Earthquake (irrespective of the
magnitude). This was done considering the definition of
magnitude by the United States Geological Survey [10].

Many attributes in the files related to the building
structure and ownership details of the buildings had string
data which were converted to their vectorized representation
using Label Encoding technique. E.g. the ownership status
in the file with building ownership details is comprised of 3
categories i.e. public, private, others which were converted
to 0,1,2 integer data values [11].

B. State Variables
There were many quantifiable variables that accounted
for the extent of damage caused by the Earthquake. The two
main category of variables are structural variables and nonstructural variables. The non-structural variables can be
further divided into string factors and boolean factors.

There were 33,417 entries in the attribute pertaining to
whether building repairs on earthquake affected buildings
had started or not, that were found to be blank. Based on the
assumption that since there was no formally documented
record of the commencement of the repairs, the blank values
were assumed to be ‘not repaired’. Such filling was done on
the basis of the worst case scenarios possible to get optimal
results.

Some of the structural variables are: area of the building
assessed, number of families in the building (in square feet),

B. Model Selection
For any classification problem, a plenitude of machine
learning algorithms are available and thus to choose the best
among them, it is necessary to evaluate them on the same
data based on a suitable parameter.

government office, whether the building has secondary use
as a health post, whether the building has secondary use as a
police station.
V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The library that has been used to plot the below figures is
an open source Python library [8].

Here we chose F1 score with ‘weighted’ average, as
calculated in accordance with the content mentioned in the
Hackerearth website [7], as our evaluation metric. The F1
score is a weighted average of precision and recall as
mentioned below:

F1

2 * precision * recall
precision  recall

precision

(1)

TP
TP  FP

(2)

(3)

TP  FN

The graphs in Fig 3, Fig 4 and Fig 5 compare the number
of affected buildings (count) for a particular Damage Grade
to their corresponding foundation type, roof type and ground
floor type respectively. The corresponding tables Table II,
Table III and Table IV depict the ratio of number of
buildings of Damage Grade 5 to Damage Grade 1 for a
corresponding foundation type, roof type and ground floor
type respectively. The ratios indicate the likelihood of
buildings with the given material’s ability to sustain damage
against earthquakes. The ratios are considered here instead
of directly comparing the number of affected buildings as
the former can take into account the variation observed
among the Damage Grades in each case, irrespective of the
number of affected buildings.

Here, TP refers to True Positive, i.e. When the model rightly
predicts a positive result.
FP refers to False Positive i.e. When the model wrongly
predicts a positive result
FN refers to False Negative i.e. When the model wrongly
predicts a negative result.
On running the predefined classification algorithms on
the preprocessed data, the following F1 results were
obtained, as simulated by the Hackerearth platform

C. Prediction
The models developed by the individual algorithms were
trained on the training dataset and then test data was used
for final prediction of damage grades and for evaluation.
Since on evaluation, Random Forest Classifier algorithm
was found to possess the highest F1 score, the model was
considered for the prediction process.

building foundation for damage grade 1 and damage grade 5 respectively

The feature importance method was used to obtain the
importance of the features in our model [15]. Out of all the
features that were considered in the initial model, the least
important features were dropped, thus producing a more
accurate prediction of the damage grade. The threshold
value for a feature to be relevant to our model was set to be
0.000200, i.e. any parameter with feature importance less
than this value would be dropped from our dataset.

On dropping the following Boolean attributes from the
dataset we found an increase in the model score from

use as an institution, whether the building has other
geotechnical risks, whether the building has secondary use
as a school, whether the building has secondary use as a

ratio 7.678 from Table II indicating high likelihood of
damage. Additionally, it even has the most count among
affected buildings of Damage Grade 1 and Damage Grade 5.
The foundation type Reinforced Concrete has the least ratio
of 0.0358 from Table II, indicating the least amount of
damage and the highest sustainability among the materials
used. It is also the least frequent among the Damage Grade
buildings. Foundation types ‘Bamboo / Timber’ and
‘Cement Stone / Brick’ with ratios of 0.3274 and 0.535 from
Table II respectively can also be considered as cheaper
alternatives to Reinforced Concrete.

The material used in the ground floor is indicative of the
material that should be used in the subsequent floors above
as well. In Fig 5, it can be observed that for ground floor
type ‘Mud’, the ratio is 6.0950, the highest from Table IV,
implying that it is more susceptible to a higher grade of
damage. The ratio of ground floor type ‘Reinforced
concrete’ from Table IV is the least i.e. 0.1223, depicting
again that it holds up well against earthquake damage.
Meanwhile the ratio for the commonly used ground floor
type ‘Brick /Stone’ is 4.704, implying that it is also prone to
damage at the time of an earthquake. The ground floor type
‘Timber’ is comparatively less susceptible to damage, with a
ratio of 1.655.

In Fig 4, it can be observed that the buildings having the
roof type ‘Bamboo/Timber – Heavy roof’ has the highest
ratio of 5.967 from Table III depicting the futility of its use
against earthquakes. It also has the most building count
among both, Damage Grade 1 and Damage Grade 5 graphs.
‘Bamboo/Timber – Light Roof’ is likely to resist damage
more than its heavier counterpart, with a ratio of 4.603 from
Table III. RCC/ RB/ RBC or Reinforced Cement Concrete /
Reinforced Brick / Reinforced Brick Concrete has the least
ratio of 0.0919 from Table III, indicating it to be a good roof
top material to sustain the impact of earthquake. It even has
the least building count among Damage Grade 5 buildings.

Thus, from the results obtained from the analysis of the
above plotted bar graphs, it can be safely concluded that
Reinforced Concrete is a material that can be used in the
construction of the building foundation, the building
rooftop, as well as the building ground floor. Reinforced
concrete is a known material in the field of building
construction on account of its ability to withstand high
tensile stress, particularly when reinforced with steel. This
premise is observed in accordance with [6]. It can be
reinforced with various materials ranging from Steel to a
few other polymers.

VI. CONCLUSION
This work presents that the Random Forest Classifier
algorithm has the highest accuracy in predicting the damage
due to earthquakes, based on the F1 score calculated for
each of the four algorithms previously mentioned in this
work. K-Nearest Neighbors has been observed to be the
second most preferred algorithm for earthquake damage
prediction. On analysis of the materials that help curb
damage to buildings during an earthquake, the work
concludes that Reinforced Concrete is the material most
suited to the cause. Earthquakes are well known to excite
electromagnetic pulse, that cause tremors under the Earth’s
crust. These electromagnetic pulses are shielded effectively
by Reinforced Concrete. Reinforced concrete has a low
tensile strength, and hence Steel bars are used, which are
embedded in the concrete sets. This provides Reinforced
Concrete with immense ability to withstand natural
calamities such as Earthquakes. This fact justifies the reason
for the widespread presence of Reinforced Concrete among
the buildings with Earthquake Damage grade 1, and its
minimal presence in buildings with Earthquake Damage
grade 5. The applications of this work can be further
extended to predict damage caused by Earthquakes in areas
for which a similar and relevant dataset can be obtained.

Abstract--Cardiovascular disease has increased rapidly in the
past few decades. It has become a leading cause of death
globally. Heart disease has affected the global heterogeneous
population irrespective of age and gender. According to World
Health Organization, an estimated 17.3 million people died
from cardiovascular diseases in 2008, representing 30% of all
global deaths. The accurate and timely prediction of these
diseases has become a challenge for medical organizations. A
mere assumption of absence or presence of disease is an
approach used by many hospitals to give prediction results.
The predictions of the heart disease are dependent mainly on
the prominent factors involved and their effect weightage.
Finding out the patterns and extracting knowledge from those
patterns is the major task at hand. Data mining techniques
have proven to be a good means for this knowledge discovery.
This study makes use of the prominent features of two data
mining techniques, namely, K-Means Clustering and Decision
Tree. These methods, one being unsupervised learning and the
other supervised learning, use very different approaches to
predict the results. The positive factors of both the techniques
have been used to build a Hybrid Classifier. The aim is to
provide an algorithm which gives the best accuracy and
performance for the Heart disease identification system.

The WSN routing protocols can be coarsely divided
based on network structure into flat and hierarchical routing
algorithms. Hierarchical routing has node to node route will
be established inside network while identifying route for
nodes in a group wise manner logically. LEACH is CH
algorithm which assumes communication connectivity
directly between CHs and BS using single hop. Contrary to
LEACH, PEGASIS adopts multi-hops to achieve the same
[9]. The network includes routing protocol with data
aggregation at CH so as to send aggregated data from CH to
BS (thus avoiding direct communication between individual
nodes) so as to prolong network like span [6-9]. Authors
have anticipated variation of LEACH namely VLEACH and
MODLEACH in context of energy efficient LEACH [10].

Abstract—WSN is a network wherein energy constrained
sensors and Base Station (BS) are spatially distributed. Each
sensors consists of limited power supply in terms of battery
and hence, information sensed must be transferred to the BS
by consuming optimal energy, henceforth prolonging the
operational period of network. This paper mainly focuses on
designing energy proficient algorithm for routing called Bioinspired antcuckoo optimized relay based energy-efficient data
aggregation (BACREED-LEACH) for network of WSN. In the
anticipated work, BS is not involved in cluster formation and
the work is carried out in 2 phases. The first phase involves
identification of number of clusters, the CHs (CH), cluster
membership and the relay node(RN). The second phase, intra
cluster communication, data aggregation at CH, followed by
transmission of aggregated data from CH to BS via RN. The
intra cluster communication prevents loss of energy of nodes
which are far away from the CH node. The RN prevents loss of
energy of CH nodes by forwarding the data from CHs to BS. In
the anticipated work, Ant Colony optimization (ACO)
algorithm is used in first iteration for identifying number of
CH and selection of CHs, followed by use Cuckoo Search for
intra cluster communication as part of second phase. From
second iteration onwards, ACO is used only for identifying
number of clusters followed by cluster formation Cuckoo
search followed by second phase. The experiment conducted in
Spyder-py3 tool. The performance of anticipated work is
evaluated in terms of network life time, average energy
consumption, and average throughput. The anticipated work
outperformed the results obtained Ant Cuckoo optimized using
energy-efficient data aggregation (ACEED LEACH), Bioinspired ant-cuckoo
optimized energy-efficient
data
aggregation (BACEED-LEACH), Ant optimized using EnergyEfficient Data aggregation (AEED LEACH), and Genetic
Algorithm data Aggregation (GADA-LEACH).

Clustering promotes distributed network, improves easy
network management and helps in carrying out local
decisions [6-7]. WSN routing problems possibly optimized
by implementing through bio-inspired algorithms [8-10]. In
[14] authors have combined ACO and Cuckoo Search (CS)
with LEACH to make efficient utilization of energy. Initially
the Base Station (BS) is responsible for Cluster Head (CH)
selection followed by cluster formation. Within each cluster
the CH receives sensed data directly from individual cluster
members. From second iteration onwards ACO decides
number of CH and followed by cluster formation using CS.
The current anticipated work is an extension of [14]. The
anticipated work designed involves two different bioinspired techniques namely ACO & CS along with an
identification of RN to optimize communication between CH
and BS to increase the life span of conventional LEACH
routing algorithm. The anticipated algorithm is named as
Bio-inspired Ant-Cuckoo Relay based optimized EnergyEfficient Data aggregation [BACREED-LEACH]. The
authors have attempted to improve work by introducing (i)
intra cluster communication using CS and (ii) RN for
communication between CH’s and BS. Further in the
anticipated work CH selection is independent of BS.

Keywords—WSN, Cuckoo Search, Ant Colony Optimization,
Genetic Algorithm, network performance measures

I. INTRODUCTION
WSN with distributed autonomous sensing devices
combined of bio-inspired techniques has become a vibrant,
futuristic primary and extensively spread from past two
decades application trends in research area [1-2], which is
widely used in different real-time applications including
farming, battlefield surveillance, and house security to many
more domains [3-5]. WSN renders and is applicable for
multi- disciplinary field by its nature, but faces many
technical hitches [6-7]. Normally sensors are placed in
terrain regions and as they are embedded with small amount
of power supply, there is a need to sense data, consuming
energy efficiently [2-4].

The role of bio-inspired algorithms is briefed in section
II, in addition three more WSN work based on ACO,
ACO+CS and GA algorithms are briefed. The anticipated
BACREED-LEACH is described in Section III. Section IV
discusses results of anticipated work, followed by
conclusions and further enhancements.

II. LITERATURE SURVEY
Bio-inspired evolutionary algorithms are meta-heuristic
population-based optimization algorithms inspired by
behavior of birds, animals, insect, genes etc. Bio- inspired
algorithm such as Ant colony, Genetic Algorithm [GA],
Particle Swarm Optimization [PSO], , Cuckoo Search
optimization, Bat optimization, Artificial Bee colony (ABC)
and many more evolutionary algorithms are getting more
eminence in the field of WSN as well as in other fields [1125]. In [2, 25] GA has been applied based algorithm to
optimal route best route between CH and BS. Further,2GA
has been adapted for choosing CH selection in WSN [1517,27]. PSO principle’s is been introduced for basic
operations of WSN [13-14]. ACO was primarily extensively
used for cluster design and selection of CH [17] and applied
for data aggregation in [18]. In addition many bio- inspired
techniques have been applied by many researchers for
hierarchical WSN routing which includes Gravitational
Search [19], Firefly [20], Artificial Bee Colony [21], Local
Centroid Bat [22] Big Bang Crunch[24], Flower Pollination
[23], Cuckoo Search [25], Adaptive Particle Swarm
Optimization [13], Ant Colony optimization [17-18]
algorithms for CH selection, deciding number of clusters and
cluster formation. Literature survey reveals that bio-inspired
based computing has improved WSN lifetime.

Fig. 1. Formation of cluster in GA

The second phase, sensing and transmission of
aggregated data takes places between CH and BS via RN.
Depending on average energy remaining in network the
transmission of packet takes place else once again cluster
formation is done using GA until the WSN nodes are alive.
The performance of GADA- LEACH proved to better than
LEACH, LEACH-C in terms of throughput, and number of
alive nodes.
ACO featured AntNet based protocol for routing was first
discussed and used in 1997 based on the behavior of real ants
[18-28]. In 2009 researchers gained interest and introduced
another bio-inspired technique Cuckoo Search optimization
algorithm (CS). CS algorithm is applicable for problems with
multimodal nature [28]. In [28] CS is applied for solving
localization in WSN. An emotional chaotic CS is applied in
solving with a key criteria based on more than one objective
using CS algorithm.

GADA-LEACH [27] is GA based WSN with GA used
for selection of both selection of CH and cluster formation
for LEACH algorithm. GA involves selection, crossover and
mutation operation for cluster formation. In addition to GA
authors have introduced RN to increase the lifespan of CH by
acting as a mediator between all CH and BS. GADALEACH [27] is GA based WSN with GA used for selection
of both selection of CH and cluster formation for LEACH
algorithm. GA involves selection, crossover and mutation
operation for cluster formation. In addition to GA authors
have introduced RN to increase the lifespan of CH by acting
as a mediator between all CH and BS.

In [11] authors have anticipated two different algorithms:
(i) AEED LEACH to optimize energy efficiency through
routing applying ACO technique and (ii) ACEED LEACH
using combination of ACO and CS for improving LEACH
performance. Both the algorithm work in two phases: In
phase I grouping of sensors into clusters through selection of
CH, & identification of cluster members and in phase II data
aggregation and transmission of packets to BS is done. For
AEED LEACH, authors have used Eq. 2 with probabilistic
rule to select the next hop node by Ant and Eq. 3 and 4 are
used to form clusters. The decision to retain or drop node are
fully probability based with computational valued of eq. 5-7
in both AEED and ACEED. The decision is influenced by
neighbor Ant nodes which cause similar nodes more
probably placed together. The chances are more of dropping
when similar nodes are placed with higher density nearby.
The Fig . 2 gives a pictorial representation of computation
performed in AEED LEACH protocol

Fitness Function = [(0.3 * F1) + (0.35 * F2) + (0.35 * F3)] (1)
where = Energy of all nodes of CHs, = Euclidian
Distance of CH with its associated nodes Number of nodes in
cluster = Euclidian Distance of BS from all CH ‘s.
Best chromosomes (minimum fitness function) are
selected using Roulette wheel followed by crossover and
mutation operations. It works in two different phases with
LEACH protocol. To start with the initial network
parameters are set, followed by cluster selection of CH by
GA using minimum fitness function (eq. 1) in first phase.
The cluster formation is shown in Fig . 1,

represents next level’s trail factor. After each round and
before beginning of next round all sensors will compute their
energy level and transmit. Based on the current residual

next two rounds or dropped. In ACEED LEACH CS and
ACO for improving the lifespan of LEACH by CH selection.
Initially the BS is responsible for CH selection followed by
cluster formation using CS eq 8. From second iteration
onwards ACO decides number of CH using eq 2, followed
by cluster formation using CS eq.8. The working process of
ACEED LEACH involves two different phases as in
LEACH: with initial round to form clusters and later for
sensing, aggregation and transmission of data to BS. The
steps are as depicted in Fig . 3. The formation of new clusters
is decided based on soft and hard threshold value, if sensors
node value falls below hard and soft value then clusters
formation is done, else if energy only falls below soft then
same clusters will be continued until it falls below hard
threshold. In eq 5.,

The designed algorithm functions in two phases: Cluster
Formation and Data Sensing phases. First phase is a cluster
formation which includes deciding number of cluster, CH
selection, members of clusters, formation of communication
path between CH and its corresponding cluster members,
identification of RN to communicate between CHs & BS. In
sensing phase, CH collects sensed data from all its nodes in a
cluster through intra communication. Once, data at CH is
aggregate and forwarded to BS via RNs. The anticipated
work BACEED LEACH is depicted in Fig . 4. The two
main reason for achieving better performance are
introduction of intra cluster communication and the RN
which is not in [14]. The RN will be identified in Cluster
Formation phase to conserve energy of CH by avoiding long
distance communication to BS. The RN is selected based on
the energy level and minimum distance to the BS. Further
the RN neither be CH nor belongs to any cluster. The
previous RN will not be considered in next CHs selection
and likewise, previous iteration CHs will not be considered
in selection of next iteration RN.

The BACEED LEACH works as follows. To start with
the initial network and energy of node is set. In the first
iteration, as part of first phase, ACO is used for cluster
formation (using eq. 2-4) which includes selection of number
of clusters, CH and members of cluster. RN is identified.
Second phase, involves, the formation of intra
communication within clusters, followed by sensing phase
and sending the aggregated data from CH to BS via RN. For
further iterations, ACO is applied only to decide number of
clusters using eq. 1 and cluster formation is carried out using
CS using eq. 8. The intra communication of clusters is built
based on principle of CS, a search space computation using
Levy angle and random walk of eq. 9. In eq. 9, best route
function is used to identify best energy leveled among n
nodes considered, nest is number of nodes, rand fun to select
least distance to BS, bad route function considers maximum
distance to BS. In Sensing Phase, CH will collect sensed data
from its cluster members via intra communication paths. The
data will be aggregated and forwarded to BS via RN. The
decision is made either to retain or drop WSN nodes using
eq. (5), (6) & (7). The formation of new clusters is decided
based on soft and hard threshold value, if sensors node value
falls below hard and soft value then clusters formation is
done, else if energy only falls below soft then same clusters
will be continued until it falls below hard threshold. The
process continues till the network nodes expire.

III. ANTICIPATED WORK
In this paper, authors are proposing an improved LEACH
protocol based on two bio-inspired algorithms namely ACO
and CS. Earlier to this work; authors have carried out
LEACH improvement using ACO and CS [14]. The current
work is an extension of [14] with slight changes so as to
further optimize energy. There are three main incremental
changes in the current work: (1) the BS is not responsible for
CH selection in the first iteration (2) introducing intra cluster
communication between CH and cluster members and (3)
introducing RN between CHs and BS. Following are the
assumptions made for simulating the anticipated work. The
placement of BS will assumed to known by all the nodes
present in the network. Normally BS will be assumed to
available outside the network and consist of higher
computational capability when compared to other sensors.
The sensors are assumed to have energy constrains when
compared to BS, whereas BS will not have any energy
constraints. The nodes considered are capable of transmitting
and receiving data to and from BS and are not provided with
GPS/GPRS. The nodes are capable of performing small
amount of computation in it. The simulation setup is
considered similar to LEACH protocol. Assumption is made

protocols but slightly poor compared to BACREED LEACH,
which indicates the introduction of RN definitely improved
the performance of anticipated work. The performance of
LEACH was poor among all the 6 protocols. The
performance of ACEED LEACH is also better when
compared to GADA LEACH.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Experimental simulations are briefed in this section
which has been conducted in Spyder-Py-3 for anticipated
BACREED- LEACH protocol. The simulation results of
anticipated work are compared with BACEED-LEACH
(anticipated work without RN), GADA-LEACH, AEED
LEACH, ACEED LEACH and LEACH. Simulation network
parameters for BACREED-LEACH, BACEED-LEACH,
AEED LEACH and ACEED LEACH are described in
Table1 and GADA LEACH network parameters in Table 1
and Table 2.

NLS is evaluated using number of CH in each round as
shown in Fig . 5. The number of CH nodes for 2500 rounds
are considered, for 6 different protocols mentioned earlier.
Comparatively number of clusters formed in anticipated
protocol is more which proves that lifetime is extended
compared to other protocols. Accordingly, nearly 2-3%
improvement is shown compared protocol developed without
RN and nearly 5-8% to our earlier algorithm ACEED
LEACH. The first and last node death of considered 100
nodes for 1000 rounds is indicated as shown in Fig . 6. Both
Fig . 5 and 6 depicts that network life time of anticipated
BACREED LEACH protocol is better than other compared
methods. The performance of BACEED LEACH (without
RN) also proved to better than other protocols but slightly
poor compared to BACREED LEACH, which indicates the
introduction of RN definitely improved the performance of
anticipated work. The performance of LEACH was poor
among all the 6 protocols. The performance of ACEED
LEACH is also better when compared to GADA LEACH.

The performance of anticipated work is evaluated in
terms of (1) throughput, (2) energy consumption and (3)
network life span for (a) number of CH and (b) all nodes.

A. Network Lifetime
Network life span (NLS) is evaluated using number of
CH in each round as shown in Fig. 5. The number of CH
nodes for 2500 rounds are considered, for 6 different
protocols mentioned earlier. Comparatively number of
clusters formed in anticipated protocol is more which proves
that NLS is extended compared to other protocols.
Accordingly, nearly 2-3% improvement is shown compared
protocol developed without RN and nearly 5-8% to our
earlier algorithm ACEED LEACH. The first and last node
death of considered 100 nodes for 1000 rounds is indicated
as shown in Fig. 6. Both Fig. 5. and Fig.6. depicts that NLS
of anticipated BACREED LEACH protocol is better than
other compared methods. The performance of BACEED
LEACH (without RN) also proved to be better than other

B. Throughput
Fig . 7 shows the amount of packets sent from CH to the
BS in each round for anticipated algorithm. The total
packets sent to BS from the network computes a throughput
of a network. The results in Fig . 7 infer that throughput is
more in case of BACREED-LEACH. The performance of
BACEED LEACH also proved to better than other protocols
but slightly poor compared to BACREED LEACH, which
indicates the importance of RN. The performance of
LEACH was poor among all the 6 protocols with a
maximum of just 20 packets compared to 50 packets by
anticipated work. The performance of ACEED LEACH is
also better when compared to GADA LEACH.

V. CONCLUSIONS
A hybrid algorithm comprising of two bio inspired
algorithms: ACO and Cuckoo has been anticipated for
designing energy efficient routing algorithm (BACREEDLEACH) based on LEACH. The designed algorithm does
not require any prior information for forming clusters,
instead forms dynamic network by deciding number of
clusters, identification of cluster member and CH using 2
bio-inspired algorithms: ACO and CS. ACO decides the
number of CH and CS aims for cluster formation (CH
selection and intra cluster communication) . In addition RN
has been introduced to further minimize energy
consumption. The anticipated work outperforms the results
of BACEED, AEED-LEACH, ACEED LEACH and GADALEACH. The RN concept and intra cluster communication in
BACREED has undeniably improved Network life time,
average throughput, and average energy consumption. It was
also observed that ACEED LEACH proved to better than
LEACH, AEED LEACH for all the performance criteria
have tested. GADA was better than AEED LEACH and
LEACH. ACO alone in AEED did not prove to be better
when compared to ACO and CS in ACEED LEACH. In
our work, among the various bio-inspired algorithms
adopted for LEACH improvement, it was observed that
AEED LEACH showed less improvement over LEACH and
BACREED LEACH showed markable improvement over
LEACH. As part of our research future work, we would like
to extend work by surveying still more bio-inspired
algorithms for network design with multi-hop and multilayer, for energy efficient routing and to increase reliability
of BS

The energy consumed in a network for every activity
evaluates to power dissipated by the network. Fig . 8 depict
that energy consumption by nodes with respect to iterations.
The plot in Fig . 8 clearly depict the low energy consumption
of anticipated work with the compared works. GADA proved
to better than both AEED and LEACH. In terms of energy
consumption BACREED-LEACH is far better in comparison
to other algorithms.

Abstract—India has always been a high agricultural value
country. Agriculture and its industries are one of the
country's leading sources of life and economy. The prediction
of crops can lead to a positive response that can help farmers
improve yields and reduce losses. Natural chemicals like
Nitrogen(N), Phosphorus(P), Potassium(K), pH along with
soil type (clay soil, black soil, red soil, silt soil ,etc.,) and
average rainfall dataset are used to predict yield. This project
concentrates on balancing macro nutrients (NPK) which is
very important requirement for the crop growth. Different
doses of these nutrients will be considered foryield prediction
of various regions of Karnataka. Since, macro nutrients play
major role, by varying the amount of nutrients supplied for
crops and sharing this knowledge to farmers will help them to
increase crop yield. This proposed work will help farmers to
identify the right amount of nutrients supply to particular
crops like maize, rice and wheat. Farmers are losing their
yield by having lack of knowledge about nutrients
requirement for particular crops, this paper concentrates on
rice, maize and wheat crop for various regions of Karnataka
for prediction. Right quantity of nutrients supply will help
farmers to increase their yield.

Abstract— Medical Diagnosis is a vast field of
knowledge and most part of the world relies on the
expertise of doctors to lead them to the correct
diagnosis and results. The paper represents a
software application hosted on Amazon EC2 using
AWS. It is designed to deal with clinical diagnosis of a
patient in a uniform and robust manner using the
expertise built on real life clinical datasets and rules
provided to it. Software approaches an expert system
using decision tree algorithm and multi-classification
neural net model to conclude to a disease diagnosis.
The paper emphasizes on Pyrexia of Unknown Origin
aka Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO) as initial
symptom use case to demonstrate the application and
it can be generalized for other initial symptoms as per
the requirement.

Abstract— Today IoT is one of the most widely adopted
technologies and is constantly evolving with the explosion of
devices in various sectors such as Industrial, Consumer and
Enterprises. The use cases and benefits to connect various
devices are almost endless. However, one of the key aspects to
successful enabling of IoT system is to ensure Security of the
connected devices as well the networks involved in connecting
these devices. Raspberry Pi is a proven low power platform that
can be used to create IoT devices. In this paper, a Zonal
Architecture is presented to simplify the IoT eco-system.
Further, an attempt is made to provide a quick enablement of
security features using Bouncy castle library on Raspberry Pi
platform and provide a detailed report on the performance of
different crypto algorithms for several use cases/operations such
as Key generation, Hash generation, encryption/decryption and
Signature/verification.
Keywords—Raspberry Pi, Bouncy
Cryptography, IoT, Zonal Architecture

Abstract²Communication between human brain and
computer system is provided by Brain Computer Interfaces
(BCI). BCI was basically developed to help the disabled to lead
a better life. But with the advancement in technology and
neuroscience devices, there is a slight change in the research
directions so as to make fictions into reality. Music related
BCI’s are one such area of research which is emerging in
recent days. This paper provides a narrowed view of research
papers based on audio signal processing and brain signal
processing. In audio signal processing the reviewed papers are
related to Western music and Indian Music. In brain signal
processing area, BCI’s developed for western music such as
brain signals controlled music player, music composition,
music evaluation, changes in brain signals when listening to
different music, musical interfaces etc. are considered. Later
paper provides details regarding Indian classical music and its
effects on brain waves. The vision of this study is to highlight
the survey of BCIs focusing on music and then narrowing the
view towards Indian music in conclusion.

Abstract— Insomnia is a widely prevalent sleep disorder that
has an adverse effect on the lifestyle of millions across the world.
This paper proposes a novel probabilistic approach to identify
insomnia. The proposed technique makes use of the positive
predictive values of the Insomnia Severity Index and Athens
Insomnia Scale to provide a stochastic measure of the existence
of insomnia in a college student. A machine learning model for
prediction of these levels on the basis of the Depression, Anxiety
and Stress levels and their Social Adjustment level has been
developed. The dataset was created with 158 samples collected
from students by conducting online surveys based on
standardizes tests. A neural network model was developed to
predict the probability of insomnia. The results predicted by the
neural network were compared with their actual values, giving
a RMSE value of 0.13, which is deemed viable. The important
contributions of this paper are creation of a new dataset,
analysis and a probabilistic modelling of insomnia scores which
should provide a significant improvement to the current classbased approach of classification.
Keywords— Insomnia. Probabilistic Modelling. Indian
College Students. Artificial Neural Network. Survey-based
testing.

crying sounds in different contexts such as hunger,
sleepiness, pain and so on. Nowadays, increasing penetration
of Smart phones and their sensing, computing and
communication facilities have led to their use for monitoring
different kinds of sound patterns daily routine and remote
monitoring assistance [3] [14]. Prior works are often
restricted to recognition of patterns of crying sounds for
early diagnosis and treatment of new-borns. Some of the cry
sound detection methods were developed for cloud
computing platform where an user’s device sends the audio
to a centralized cloud for per- forming recognition task. The
user-cloud computing demands higher bandwidth utilization
costs and power consumption due to the continuous
transmission of the recorded audio from a place of
monitoring. Few of the past projects focused on automatic
detection of baby cries under different background sound
environments or controlled settings.
In this paper, we present deep learning based effective
baby cry sound detection (BCSD) method under different
kinds of background sounds in indoor home environments.
The BCSD methods are based on the mel-frequency cepstral
coefficients and machine learning classifiers such as onedimensional convolutional neural networks, feed-forward
neural networks, and multi-class support vectors machines.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II
summarizes the cry sound detection and analysis methods.
Section III presents three baby cry sound recognition
methods. Section IV presents the evaluation results of three
methods. Eventually, conclusions are drawn in Section IV.

Abstract— Effective automatic baby cry sound detection
plays a significant role in many applications of smart baby
condition monitoring. The paper presents deep learning based
effective baby cry sound detection (BCSD) method under
different kinds of background sounds in indoor environments.
We investigated the functioning of the three BCSD approaches
by making use of mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC)
and machine learning classifiers like one-dimensional
convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN), feed-forward neural
networks (FFNNs), and multi-class support vectors machines
(MC-SVM). We created the baby crying sounds for both
training and testing of three models. In this study, we looked
i n t o the results of three methods under different frame
lengths including 100 milliseconds, 250 milliseconds and 500
milliseconds. Evaluation results showed that the 1D-CNN with
frame length of 500 MS provides promising results as compared
to that of the frame lengths 100 milliseconds and 250
milliseconds. For frame length of 500 milliseconds, the 1DCNN-based, FFNN-based and SVM-based BCSD method had
F1-score of 98.86%, 98.46% and 97.97%, respectively for
detecting cry sounds. The 1D-CNN based BCSD method had
class-wise F1-score of above 98%. Results showed that three
BCSD methods have promising results for the same test sound
database including air-conditioner, fan, speech and music
sounds.
Keywords—Cry sound recognition, audio classification, feed
forward neural networks, 1D Convolutional neural networks and

INTRODUCTION

Cry is the essential sign of life in everybody’s life which
is seen shortly after a baby’s live birth.[1]- [5].
The cry is a multimodal and complex action with a lot of in
formation. [1]. A detailed acoustic analysis was also carried
out to measure and compare signals of the acoustic
characteristics of child cry and have demonstrated the
diagnostic possible of cry signals for pathological conditions
[1]. Furthermore, some of the researchers have studied on the
use of cry signals for identifying the systemic problems such
as cleft lip and invisible defects. In addition with
aforementioned cry pathological analysis, baby cry sound
recognition enables timely notification and allows parents to
remotely monitor when their baby is crying. Thus, an
automated recognition of crying sound patterns has become
a most popular research topic in developing smart baby
monitoring systems and analysing various patterns of

A. Related Works
In this section, we briefly summarize the cry sound
recognition and analysis methods. In [1], Y. Kheddache and
C. Tadj (2019) proposed a method to identify the diseases in
new-borns using advanced acoustic features of cry signals.
The method classifies the signals into the healthy and
pathological cry classes using the MFCC and probabilistic
neural network (PPN) classifier. The method had preteen cry
detection rate of 88.17% and full-term cry detection rate
of 82%. In [2], C. Y. Chang, et al. (2017) presented infant
cry classification method using the MFCC, as pitch,
harmonic-to-noise ratio, spectral centroid, flux, roll off, and
flatness and histogram of oriented gradients(HOG) was

frame of 50 milliseconds and 400 milliseconds for detecting
silence and extracting features from non-silence frame,
respectively. The audio frame of 25 milliseconds was
chosen
for

extraction.
The system detects streams and cries from digital devices su
ch as television and music players in urban environments th
at categorize indoor (office and home), outdoor, people inter
action, huge human meetings, machinery and audio frame
and tested for signal-to-noise ratio(SNRs) ranging from -15
dB to 40 dB. The method had a DR of 93.16% and FAR of
4.76% for a SNR values
of 20 dB and a SNR of 10
dB. In [4], H. F. Alaie et al. (2015) presented a noninvasive health care system by performing the acoustic
analysis of cry signals to quantitatively isolate and measure
those cries and distinguish between healthy and ill newborn
babies. The system consists of mono-channel, preemphasizes, segmentation of recorded cry signals, static and
dynamic MFCC feature extraction, Gaussian mixture modeluniversal background model (GMM-UBM) and a score-level
fusion. Results showed that the boosting mixture learning
(BML) based procedure has lower error rates than the
Bayesian method or the maximum a posteriori probability
(MAP) adaptation method. In [5], M. M. Jam, et al., (2013)
presented automated wavelet-based cry recognition system
for noticed children with hearing loss from normal infants
based on Mel filter-bank discrete wavelet coefficients
(MFDWCs), principle components analysis (PCA), neural
network (NN) classifier. Results showed that MFCCs and
LPCs based methods had correction rates of 91.5 % and
86.5% of respectively. In [6], R. Torres, et al. (2017)
investigate hand crafted baby cry (HCBC) features for baby
cry sound recognition and compared with the MFCCs and a
state-of-the-art CNN classifier. Results showed that HCBC
features is better than the CNN in terms of less computation
and memory space. In [7], S. Tejaswini, et al. (2016)
presented a method to classify healthy, hunger, pain, and
discomfort cries. The method consists of Preprocessing,
silence removal, wavelet transform, MFCC and SVM linear
kernel classifier. Results showed that the identification
accuracy was 93.09%, 90.27% and 71.29% respectively for
food-discomfort, pain-hunger and discomfort-pain. In [8], Y.
Lavner, et al. (2016) two machine-learning algorithms for
automatic baby cry recognition in audio recordings are
investigated: the logistic regression (LR) classifier with
MFCC, pitch and formants; and the CNN with log Mel-filter
banks. The CNN classifier shows preferable results as
differentiate to the LR classifier under various types of
domestic sounds, such as people talking and door opening. In
[9], R. Sahak, et al. (2012) investigated asphyxiated infant cry
recognition based on the MFCC, orthogonal least square
(OLS), and SVM classifier. Results showed that the OLSSVM method yields comparable accuracy of 92.5% as
compared to the DS-SVM method. In [11], J. O. Garcia,
et al. (2003) presented an automatic screening system with
the objective of classifying two types of cries: normal and
pathological cries of deaf babies based on the feature MFCC
and feed-forward neural network (FNN) classifier. The
method had the accuracy of 97.43%. In [12], M. Petroni, et
al. (1995) presented infant cry vocalization category (angry,
pain, fear) with the help of artificial neural networks such as
feed-forward neural networks (FNN), recurrent neural

networks (RNN), cascade correlation neural network and
time-delay neural networks (TDNNs).

CRY SOUND RECOGNITION METHOD

In this study, we present three cry sound recognition
methods based on the MFCC features and 3 machine classifiers such as, FFNN, 1D-CNN and multi-class SVM. The
performance of the three cry sound detection methods are
evaluated under different background sounds encountered
in indoor home environments. The block diagram of ML
based cry sound recognition method is shown in the above
mentioned diagram, cconsisting of four steps: preprocessing, extraction of features, cry models,
identification. Each cry sound detection steps is explained
in the further subsection.
.
A. Preprocessing
Practically, cry sound signals which are recorded are
commonly corrupted with low-frequency noise
components such as micro- phone artifacts, recording
instrument biasing and power-line interference which are
generated by the sensors movements and electromagnetic
(EM) since the audio sensor is exposed tothe environments.
Therefore, the audio recorded signal is sent between a High
Pass Filter (HPF) with 60 Hz threshold frequency. Next, the
signal is split up into frames with three frame lengths such
as 100 milliseconds, 250 milliseconds and 500 milliseconds
which are considered for performance evaluation. The
intensity of the cry sound varies due to the stochastic nature
of cry sound production and the area of the sound observing
zone which is time fluctuating from acoustic sensors the
source of sound. In practice the sound origin location can
be unknown. Although the function is not sensitive to the
amplitude rate, the normalization of amplitude is
performed on the zero-mean audio formed signal to limit
changes in the sensitivity of microphone.
B. MFCC Feature Extraction
In this study, we use the MFCC features for recognizing
the cry sounds signals. Each of the frame, we extract
MFCC features for the cry, fan and air-conditioner, music,
and speech signals. The feature origin is described below as
described in [13]:

frequencies which equilibrium the spectrum, as in
general high frequencies have

betters the SNR ratio. Pre-emphasis filter is

N represents training specimens number and feature vector

substitute the dot products xi and x, influenced by showing
the data into a linearly separable higher dimensional space.
The decision function is defined as:

They are input, output and hidden layer. The input for the
corresponding layer is obtained from its preceding layer.
The obtained input is evaluated and translated which is
given as input to the immediate layer. Each layer has weight
of its own. Fig. 2 represents the block diagram of the feed
forwarded neural network forward network. Non-linear

people’s view.

coefficients are calculated using

Nevertheless, the ReLU activation function can be utilised
for quick intersection of models. The ReLU is defined as f
(x) = max(0, x), which is simpler than the activation
function tanh or sigmoid because it needs a linear operator

3) 1D-CNN Classifier for Cry Sound Recognition: The
1D-CNN based cry sound recognition block diagram is
illustrated in Fig. 3. Table III summarizes 1D-CNN
architecture specifications. In this work, a study was
conducted to choose optimal no. of layers and parameters
were altered to obtain better performance. In this study, the
proposed 1D-CNN architecture contains of four
convolutions, one drop out, two maxpooling, two fully
connected layers and one flatten. The filter shifts for
convolution and maxpooling are defined as one and two
respectively. The maxpooling process minimizes the feature
maps size and holds crucial and substantial audio feature
functions. Two-Dimensional output is converted by flatten
layer into One-Dimensional output.

(iii) Description of Machine learning Classifiers
The investigation, we measure is the performance of 3
machine learning classifiers such as FFNN, 1D-CNN and
MC- SVM under numerous audio frames of size 100
milliseconds, 250 milliseconds, 500 milliseconds for
automatically recognizing four classes. In further subsections,
we briefly describe the machine learning classifiers and
specifications used for classification of four classes of sound.

To restrict the model overfitting, before each dense layer,
a dropout layer is used. In the final stage of process, the
neurons are interlinked using FC layer in the last layers.

III. Results and Discussion
In this research, four sound classes such as cry, fan and airconditioner, speech, and music are considered which can be
encountered in indoor environments. We calculated the
performance of three machine learning classifier based cry
sound recognition methods using MFCC feature.
A. Validation Sound Database
There are no much freely-available cry sound
databases in the literature. In the past published works, the
cry sound databases were created for performance
evaluation but not available for public access. Since the
major objective of this paper was to evaluate the ML based
baby crying sound detection methods performance under
different indoor background sounds, we created the sound
database including cry,

C. Performance Comparison
The comparison results of this study are summarized in
Tables VI and VII for three methods with different lengths.
We investigated the performance of three cry sound
recognition methods under different frame lengths including
100 ms, 250 ms and 500 ms. Evaluation results showed that
class- wise accuracy for the 1D-CNN is better than that of
the other classifiers for all frame lengths. For frame length
of 500 ms, the 1D-CNN-based, FFNN-based and SVMbased BCSD method had F1-score of 98.86%, 98.46% and
97.97%, respectively for detecting cry sounds.
IV. CONCLUSION
In our paper, we presented and discussed the results of
three cry sound recognition methods using the MFCC and
ML classifiers such as multi-class support vectors machines,
fully connected feed-forward neural networks, and onedimensional convolutional neural networks for indoor cry
sound monitoring applications. Evaluation results showed
that the 1D-CNN with frame length of 500 ms provides
promising results as compared to that of the frame lengths
100 ms and 250 ms. The 1D-CNN based based method had
class-wise F1-score of above 98%. Our preliminary results
demonstrated that the CNN based cry sound recognition has
a great potential applications in cry sound pattern analysis.
In future directions, we attempt to implement our methods
on real-time hardware for edge computing applications.

described in Table V. We used EVISTR digital voice
recorder and H1n Handy recorder for recording audio
signals under various home con- dictions. The signals are
converted to digital signals at sa mpling rate of 44.1
kHz and resolution of 16-bit. In addition to audio signals,
we also collected audio from the public multimedia
websites (freesound.org, soundsnap.com, pond5.com,
GTZAN library, and YouTube). The audio total duration is
around 8 hours. For training and test purposes, the audio
recorded signal is resampled to 16 kHz.

online experience is vital to attract bright students to the universities. To attract prospective students, the universities need
to have an engaging brand presence online because it is a wellknown fact that younger generations use their phones more as
compared to the older ones [3]. Social media inﬂuences the
younger generation, and hence, branding colleges/universities
on social media can help students in choosing their best-suited
universities.
Social media provides a platform that empowers individuals
to interact with one another by both sharing and consuming
information. Curiosity and attentiveness towards social media
from different domains have been increasing very steeply from
research as well as application perspectives. Social media gain

by providing a thorough comparative analysis of IndianUSA universities branding on the trending social media
platform Instagram.
We have considered the translation of sentences present in
different languages to English and we are using description and comments of posts as Instagram data to perform
sentimental analysis.
II. R ELATED W ORKS

Fig. 1: Rise of Instagram to 1 billion(image credit to statista)
Instagram has a wide range of users of all ages. However,
it is more popular with the younger generation.
Nearly two out of every three adults whose age lies between
18 and 29 use Instagram. According to [10], ”Users spend
about 53 minutes per day on Instagram”.
Instagram collects a considerable amount of data, and it
is perceived as a fantastic social knowledge platform. According to [10], Instagram has around 41 billion videos and
images shared since its inception, and 95 million images and
videos are shared on Instagram on a daily basis. Instagram
is primarily an image-prosperous application, but it is also
gaining substantial popularity for other enthralling features
it has. These features include adding a description, textual
comments, location, followers, tags, etc. next to the uploaded
photos or images. The textual data added to the uploaded
images describe the feelings and emotions of the uploader
attached to the images. The emotions attached to these textual
content is viewed as the most efﬁcient and capable approach
to interpreting the intentions of written communication.
In our study, we are making use of textual data such as the
descriptions and comments of posts on Instagram to investigate
the impact they have on the equity of university branding.
The emotions expressed through the textual contents can be
positive, negative, or neutral. We are focusing on positive and
negative emotions. As far as emotions are concerned, Psychologist Ekman [11] through his paper provides evidence that
emotions are common to all cultures, age groups, genders, and
population groups. This discovery becomes very crucial for
performing analytics on the emotions expressed by different
users through their posts on Instagram. Our contribution is as
follows:
• We scrapped the Instagram data using the popular and
endorsed hashtags of Indian and the United States colleges/universities.
• We performed Sentimental Analysis using Text-Blob
library on the Instagram data to assess the sentiments
associated with the texts.
• Our proposed study extends the Shreya Desai et al. study

Yanjia Sun et al. [12] in their study, analyzed the CEOs
facial emotions to detect the achievement of the ﬁrm as well
as its future development. They used the modeling technique
called Regional Hidden Markov Model(RHMM) to label the
salient points on the face. They classiﬁed emotions into six
categories, namely fear, surprise, disgust, happiness, anger, and
sadness. These emotion types are pre-deﬁned with 41 facial
features. The salient points describe the emotion type based on
their location on the face using RHMM. Unfortunately, they
have not considered the medical condition on the human face,
which can actuate speciﬁc salient points.
Hasan et al. [13] in their research work conducted sentimental analysis on twitter data using techniques based on Machine
Learning. They conducted this study to compare politics
reviews on twitter data using sentiment analysis techniques.
This study also concludes that the analysis using TextBlob is
the best approach for sentiment analysis.
Shreya Desai et al. [14] in their research work conducted
analytics on Social Media (Instagram) content to understand
education branding of the United States. They performed a
sentimental analysis on social media content using TextBlob.
Social media contents can be in different languages and
TextBlob, when used for sentiment calculation, provides a
correct result when dealt with English statements. Hence the
translation of different language becomes an essential factor
while performing sentimental analysis. However, no consideration has been made regarding the translation of different
languages.
III. F RAMEWORK
Our framework outlines the process followed for conducting
this study. We have considered the popular slang names as
well as the ofﬁcial names of the Indian and United States
colleges/universities as the hashtags. We have performed
our study to conduct a thorough comparative analysis of
India-USA universities branding on Instagram. Instagram data
for 100 Indian and United States colleges/universities each
has been scrapped using Phantombuster Instagram API. We
cleaned the scrapped data to assemble only the description and
comment text data for every post/image associated with the
colleges/universities on Instagram. We stored the scrapped data
in two different CSV ﬁles according to the Indian and USA
universities, respectively. We performed sentimental analysis
using TextBlob library to analyze the sentiment behind the
text data by calculating the polarity and subjectivity. Figure
2 describes the workﬂow of our study. The following subsections explain the concepts used in our study.

Fig. 2: Work Flow Diagram
A. Data Collection
The Instagram accounts of 100 Indian and USA colleges/universities each are analyzed to collect the endorsed and
popular hashtags for these universities. Most of the students
use the endorsed hashtags of their colleges/universities while
posting any images or videos related to their college/university.
Most of the colleges/universities have personalized and
approved ofﬁcial hashtags. These hashtags have been used
to scrap the recent posts' descriptions and comments which
are related to the corresponding colleges/universities from
Instagram. We have used Phantombuster API to scrap the posts

descriptions and comments from Instagram. The usage of the
endorsed and approved hashtags of the colleges/universities
determine their activities on social media. The number of posts
differs in length for different universities depending on their
social media activity. We have collected 100 posts for each
university to ensure uniformity.
When these posts have been scrapped using the hashtags,
we get large amount of data ranging from post Url, proﬁle Url,
Username, full name, like count, published Date, Description,
Query, number of likes, image URL, etc. From the scrapped
data, the post URLs have been used to scrap the comments

141

2019 4th International Conference on Computational Systems and Information Technology for Sustainable Solution (CSITSS)

related to these posts using Phantombuster Instagram API. Our
work is based on sentimental analysis, which focuses on the
textual content. Therefore, the scrapped data has been cleaned
to assemble only descriptions and comments related to the
posts.
B. Data Pre-processing
In this step, we removed the noisy data, which can affect our
result. During data collection process, we observed that many
description and comment texts were duplicated and contained
emojis. First, we removed the duplicate texts following which,
we decoded the emojis to the ofﬁcial statement that conveys its
the real meaning. The sentences were in different languages,
we translated them to English because the TextBlob analysis
gives a correct result with English sentences for calculation
of polarity and subjectivity. Python libraries like Google
trans, Goslate: Free Google Translate APIs have been used
to translate the sentences into the English language. These
translation APIs can automatically detect the language of the
sentence and convert them to the desired language.
C. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
NLP is concerned with helping the computers in interpreting, understanding, manipulating, and analyzing a large
amount of natural human languages. It is a way through which
the computers can understand and extract useful meaning from
human languages in a smart way. The main aim of NLP is to
make the computers capable and intelligent enough to deal
with human languages. It deals with different algorithms to
automatically analyze and represent human language. Some
of the popular NLP applications are Google's powerful search
engine, and more recently, Alexa, which is Amazon's voice
assistant. NLP is powerful enough to teach machines the
ability to deal with complex tasks such as dialog generation
and machine translation [15]. There are different NLP capabilities which include machine translation, content categorization,
contextual extraction, speech-to-text conversion, sentimental
analysis, document summarization, topic discovery and modeling, text-to-speech conversion, etc. The overall goal of the
NLP tasks is to take raw language as an input and use different
algorithms and linguistics to customize and translate the text
to the required results [16].
D. Sentimental Analysis
Sentimental analysis is a signiﬁcant way to determine the
sentiments behind the textual content, which can be negative,
neutral, or positive. Normally it is also referred to as opinion
mining. It is an approach to NLP that helps in identifying
the emotions behind a body of text [17]. The ability of
sentimental analysis to withdraw perception from social data
is being universally accepted by different institutions across
the world. Sentimental analysis is instrumental in analyzing
public opinion behind speciﬁc topics on social media. Ahead
of the 2012 presidential election, the Obama led government
used sentimental analysis to determine public thoughts and
opinions for announcing the blueprint of the policies and

communicating the messages during the campaign [18]. There
are different python based NLP libraries such as Natural
Language Toolkit(NLTK), SpaCy, TextBlob, Stanford Core
Library, Gensim, etc. We have chosen the TextBlob Library
for performing Sentimental Analysis. There are many NLP
tasks which are performed using Text-Blob, namely, N-grams,
part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, lemmatization,
tokenization words inﬂection, and sentiment analysis [19].
Sentiment analysis provides positive and negative polarity
classes, and in addition to these classes, it also provides
subjectivity and objectivity score for the sentences. We have
considered the TextBlob library to determine the subjectivity
and polarity of the descriptions and comments related to the
posts. TextBlob analysis is considered to be the best sentiment
analyzer for calculating the polarity and subjectivity as of
now [13]. The sentiment function of TextBlob provides a
tuple of the form sentiment(polarity, subjectivity). Subjectivity
represents a value which lies in the range of [0.0, 1.0] and the
subjective sentences generally signify personal belief, viewpoint, judgment, or emotion. However, objective sentences
stick to the facts. Polarity also represents a value which lies in
the range of [-1.0, 1.0] where positive value deﬁnes positive
sentiment, and negative value deﬁnes negative sentiment [20],
[21].
E. Performing TextBlob Analysis on the scrapped data
TextBlob is based upon NLTK and is used for processing
the textual data, which is very easy to use [22]. The summary
of the TextBlob Analysis is given in Table I.
We performed TextBlob analysis on the ﬁles containing
the scrapped data from Instagram. We divided the polarity
emotion into negative and positive emotion count for the whole
ﬁle. Based on the count, the positive and negative sentiment
emotion percentage is calculated using Equation (1).
EP =

PE /NE
× 100
TE

(1)

In Equation (1), Emotion Percentage(EP ) represents the
percentage of negative or positive emotion. Negative
Emotion(NE ) and Positive Emotion(PE ) are the total negative
and positive emotion count, respectively, in the complete
ﬁle. Total Emotion(TE ) is the count of total negative and
positive emotion in the complete ﬁle. Equation (1) is the
conventional approach we have used to calculate the negative
and positive emotion percentage for each college/university.
TextBlob analysis, when performed on the ﬁles that contain
the scrapped data, provides a negative and positive emotion
percentage in the range of 0 - 100 for each college/university.
IV. R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSIONS
In the present day, social media is not only being used
for entertainment but is also being adopted as a platform for
marketing, education, etc., because of which, the universities
are trying to develop an intense cognizance of social media
platforms and build a great network to reach out to as many

individuals as possible. The colleges/universities share their
current events, participations as well as their collaborations
on social media where individuals can share their different
opinions. These opinions have been analyzed using the concept
of sentimental analysis for 100 Indian and USA universities following which we calculated the emotion percentage,
namely, negative and positive for each university.
Figure 3 and Figure 4 display the top 10 Indian and USA
colleges/universities, respectively, having the highest positive
reviews in their description and comment section amongst 100
colleges/universities. In case of Indian colleges/universities, as
shown in Figure 3, out of 10 colleges, none of the colleges

have their ranking under 10 while 7 colleges/universities have
their ranking above 50 and 3 colleges/universities have their
ranking between 10 and 50. However, in the case of the
USA colleges/universities, as shown in ﬁgure 4, there are 5
colleges/universities which have their ranking between 10 and
50 while 5 colleges/universities have their ranking above 50
and even in this case, not even a single college/university is
able to make its way in top 10 colleges/universities with highest positive emotion. Table II shows the analysis comparison
between Figure 3 and Figure 4 based on positive emotion.
The result is strictly based on the descriptions and comments scraped from Instagram for each university and the

emotions expressed through these textual contents. During the
analysis of Figure 3, we discovered that the top 10 Indian
colleges/universities shown in the ﬁgure are not in the top
colleges/universities(according to the National Institute Ranking Framework) of India. In fact, many colleges/universities
are ranked above 50. Only three colleges/universities i.e., IIT
Indore, ISM Dhanbad and College Of Engineering Pune have
their ranking under 50.
The analysis of Figure 4, which displays the top 10 colleges/universities of USA having the most positive reviews
along with their ranking based on Forbes Top Colleges, also
reveals that these top 10 colleges/universities, shown in Figure
4, are not among the excellent colleges/universities of USA.
However, the number of top colleges/universities of USA
showing positive emotions in the ﬁgure are more compared
to that of Indian colleges/universities. A small ratio of the
comparison can be deduced from Table II.
The positive emotion analysis comparison led us to believe that in both cases, i.e., in the case of Indian and the
United States colleges/universities, the academically inclined
colleges/universities abstain from motivating their students to
post positive content on Instagram whereas the academically
low ranking universities are making great efforts to succeed via
promoting their universities through social media (Instagram)
and are able to maintain their positive image on social media
platforms like Instagram. This also means that they are successful in motivating their students to post positive content on
Instagram and are also being very particular about the positive
effect of marketing. Table II completely describes this fact
because not even a single college/university has made its way

into the top 10 college/university having the highest positive
emotion percentage on Instagram.
We also plotted the top 10 Indian and the United States
colleges/universities with the most negative reviews to have
a better analysis. Figure 6 and Figure 7 display the top 10
Indian and the United States colleges/universities, respectively,
which have the highest negative reviews amongst 100 colleges/universities. In the case of Indian colleges/universities,
shown in Figure 6, six out of ten colleges have their ranking
under 50 while 4 colleges/universities have their ranking above
50. However, in the case of United States colleges/universities,
as shown in ﬁgure 7, there are 4 colleges/universities which
have their ranking under 50 while 6 universities have their
ranking above 50. Table III shows the analysis comparison
between Figure 6 and Figure 7 based on negative emotion.
During our analysis of Figure 6, we discovered a mindboggling fact that IIT Madras which has been ranked 1 by
NIRF(National Institute Of Ranking Framework) is among
the top 10 colleges/universities having the highest negative reviews as shown in ﬁgure 6. Additionally, 6 top colleges/universities(having rank under 50 by NIRF) are among
the highest negative reviews. It shows that academically sound
universities have a considerable amount of adverse impact on
their marketing strategies.
The analysis of ﬁgure 7 also reveals that some of the top colleges/universities of USA are among the colleges/universities
having the highest number of negative reviews. However, the
number of college/universities, in this case, are less compared
to that of Indian college/universities as shown in ﬁgure 6
which concludes that the colleges/universities of United States
are more active towards their branding on social media as
compared to Indian colleges/universities.
We analyzed the overall comparison between the Indian
and the United States universities branding on social media and discovered that the Indian colleges/universities are
less active towards their social image. While conducting our
study, we also observed that there are still numerous Indian
colleges/universities which abstain from having an ofﬁcial
Instagram account. On the other hand, most of the colleges/universities of USA have their ofﬁcial Instagram account
where they are able to showcase their achievements, activities
in the ﬁeld of research, sports, fun activities, their participation
in competitions as well as their collaborations and associations.
Most of the bright students are migrating from India to the
USA to pursue their education. Figure 5 shows the number
of Indian students pursuing their education in the USA. The
branding of colleges/universities on social media has a great

role in attracting the students because the students are more
inclined towards social media, and keep track of the different
activities on social media. The universities of USA have
successfully been able to communicate their achievements to
the students through social media, and hence, most of the
Indian students are migrating to the United States to pursue
their education. As far as the Indian colleges/universities are
concerned, they provide high quality education, but they lack
in their branding and marketing skills.
According to our perception, if the Indian institutes brand
themselves on social media and are able to communicate
their capability in terms of their achievements in the ﬁeld

of research, sports, etc. not only would they be successful
in attracting the Indian students(those who are migrating
abroad) but also in attracting the international students. An
additional source of attraction for international students can
be the cost of education, which is quite cheaper as compared
to other countries. According to [23], India is considered to
be the least expensive country among the top 15 countries
for international students because the government of India
provides a considerable amount of funds for the education
streams. Once the Indian institutes showcase and channel
their achievements effectively on social media, they could be
successful in obtaining funds from different funding agencies

145

2019 4th International Conference on Computational Systems and Information Technology for Sustainable Solution (CSITSS)

who can ﬁnance their mission.
With the arrival of social media, we ﬁrmly believe that
every college/university should have an ofﬁcial account on
social media through which they can share their participations,
different activities in the ﬁeld of research, sports, academics,
fun activities, their achievements etc., because everybody is
more inﬂuenced by social media in the present day. It can
also play a crucial role in helping the students to choose their
best-suited colleges/universities.
However, some good initiatives are being taken by the
Indian government to connect the students and the colleges/universities through social media. According to [24],
Human Resource Development Ministry(MHRD) of India has
issued instructions to all higher educational institutions to
connect the social media(Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter)
accounts of all the students to the social media accounts of the
higher educational institutions as well as to that of MHRD's
accounts. The letter issued by MHRD also states that each
institute has been asked to appoint a social media coordinator
who will be responsible for handling the social media accounts
and publicizing the achievements of the colleges/universities.
This move by the government can immensely help the institutions to grow and build a new perception among the students,
which will be beneﬁcial to the institutes as well as the students.
V. C ONCLUSION
Our work illustrates a thorough comparative analysis of the
Indian and USA colleges/universities branding on Instagram.
We conducted the analysis on the comments and descriptions
which we scrapped from Instagram using the hashtags. The
sentimental analysis conducted on these contents provides
positive and negative emotion percentage present in it. These
emotion percentage might have a positive or negative impact on the decisions made by the students in choosing the
colleges/universities for their studies. The positive emotion
present in the comments or descriptions can inspire the students to choose that particular university while the negative
emotion can have an unpleasant impression of the university
on the student's mind. Our work provides an insight into the
branding's effect and approaches of the colleges/universities
on Instagram. It motivates them to have a constructive approach towards their branding on social media. According
to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to analyze the
colleges/universities branding and its inﬂuence on the younger
generation through the contents(comments and descriptions of
the posts) of Instagram by having a comparative investigation
on India-USA universities branding. To enhance our study,
we have thought of considering all the different social media
platforms, and then compare the university branding across
different platforms and provide the ranking as well based on
the different social media platforms(For this study, we have
considered only Instagram as a social media platform).

Abstract— Human facial emotion recognition has been
studied for decades as facial expression confers added
impact in recognizing human emotions and improves
communication. Recently, emotion recognition through
facial images has become an active research area with the
evolution of deep learning in computer vision. This paper
presents work on emotion recognition through facial images
using layer based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
The proposed method for emotion recognition is named as
DPIIER (Deep learning Pose Illumination Invariant Emotion
Recognition). In this work, we have used 15 layers for
constructing CNN that learns from CMU Multi-PIE facial
expression dataset images, to recognize and classify five basic
emotions: Neutral, Anger, Happy, Surprise and Disgust. The
uniqueness of DPIIER lies in the size of input images with
different pose and illumination variations. We have used
32x32 small size images for training and testing of emotion
recognition and the developed algorithm is pose and
illumination invariant. To test the robustness of the
algorithm, III-fold cross validation has been performed and
the average accuracy achieved is 96.55% by using CNN
based algorithm on Graphical Processing Unit (GPU). The
processing time for training and testing are 4 min and 110200 m sec respectively. The cross dataset validation is
performed using different datasets JAFFE, CK+ and KDEF.

common attacks we tried on the proposed model.

Abstract—Cryptography has decidedly been in the ﬁeld of
research for decades with the motif of enhancing the security of
information exchange. This paper exhibits a variation in the
implementation of a classical cipher technique, the Playfair
cipher. The motive is to make the ciphertext produced less
vulnerable to attacks; we have tested the same with a common
attack, the brute-force attack. The proposed model is also
statistically analyzed for vulnerability against the performance
of the classical encryption technique.
Keywords - Cryptography, ciphers, cryptanalysis, attacks,
brute-force, hill climbing, Fibonacci sequence, golden ratio,
generator, vulnerability, plaintext, ciphertext

2. The Playfair cipher

The Playfair cipher [2], [3] or the Wheatstone cipher
was invented by Charles Wheatstone in 1854 but is well
known by the name Playfair since Lord Playfair was at the
forefront of the promotion of the cipher.
The cipher technique belongs to the family of symmetric
cipher which dominantly uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. The key in this case is a word or a
phrase.
1. Introduction
The cipher technique also uses a matrix formed with the
elements in the alphabet set of the language of the original

Figure 2. Matrix formed with key phrase ‘HELLO WORLD’ as per Playfair
cipher

Figure 4. Frequency (in percent) of occurrence of monograms in Deutsch
[7]

The matrix, as mentioned, is a 5x5 matrix with 25 letters
from the alphabet (Fig. 2). ‘Q’ is opted out1 since the
frequency of usage of ‘Q’ is pretty less (0.095%).
The plaintext is rewritten to lose the blank spaces and
‘X’ is inserted in between repeated characters (Fig. 1). The
augmented plaintext is then arranged into pairs and padded
with ‘Z’ at the end when necessary, to have a pair.

If both the letters in the digram are in the same column, substitute each letter with the letter below them, with
wraparound.
SM would substitute to TN
If the letters in the digram are in different columns and
different rows, substitute each letter with a letter in their
row (horizontally) such that a rectangle is formed with the
4 letters.
ET would substitute to WN
thus, following the procedure mentioned above, the ciphertext is as follows

assumed inputs

3. Related Work
Several modiﬁcations to the Playfair cipher have been
proposed over the years. While few notable changes include
modiﬁcations in building the matrix, others portray a change
in the method of encryption of the plaintext.
Table 1 shows an overview of some of the different
proposals.

Figure 3. A histogram showing the relative frequency of occurrences of
the letters in English alphabet [4], [5], [6]

In Fig. 1 , padding with ‘Z’ is not necessary since
the number of characters is even and thus satisﬁes the
requirements of a digram.
The substitution is carried out as follows
If both the letters in the digram are in the same row,
substitute each letter with the letter to their right, with
wraparound2 .
LE would substitute to OL
Figure 6. Timeline showing a few modiﬁcations made on Playfair cipher

1. The Playfair cipher was predominantly used during the World Wars.
The frequency of occurrence of ‘Q’ as a monogram in other languages
are much lesser than that in English language and it has been ever since
the mode of opting out ‘Q’ in the cipher table. Another approach to make
matrix in the cipher technique involves keeping ‘Q’ and keeping ‘I’ and
‘J’ together in the same cell. This approach is practiced less.
2. Wraparound is a situation when the letter that is to be enciphered is
at the either end columns of the matrix, in this case the letter is ciphered
based on the mathematical modulo operation

4. The proposed variation
The procedure of grouping of the augmented plaintext
into digrams remain the same as that in the classical Playfair
cipher. The proposed model uses a 6x6 matrix instead of a

and the special character underscore ( ‘_’ ).
The decimal digit set is
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
The underscore ( ‘_’ ) is a fairly frequently used special character, not far behind the comma ( ‘,’ ), the most

The golden ratio, resembled by the greek symbol
Phi(φ), is practically the most irrational number. The
beauty lies in the fact that φ can be represented using itself
as shown in equation 3. It is a recurring fraction.

4.1. The Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence [12] is one where a term is the
sum of its preceding 2 terms, the ﬁrst two terms being 0
and 1.
A sequence is an ordered list of numbers and a series is
the sum of the terms in the sequence.
The Fibonacci sequence is one with the ﬁxed generators
0 and 1.
The sequence is as follows :

The relationship between the golden ratio and the
Fibonacci sequence is not unknown to us, the golden ratio
is the limit of the ratio of a term in Fibonacci sequence to
the one preceding it as in equation 5.

lim n → ∞

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233
The mathematical formula to generate the series is

F (n)
=φ
F (n − 1)

(5)

A small part of this concept has been used to modify
the encryption technique in the existing Playfair cipher.

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) , F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1; n ≥ 2

5.1.1. Encryption . The rules are as follows :
1. Select a prime number(represented by the greek symbol Nu, ν ) under 36 (since 36 is the maximum number of
cells in the 6x6 cipher table).

4.2. The Golden Ratio
In mathematics, two numbers are said to be in the
golden ratio [13] if their ratio (larger to smaller) is equal

8. Keep only the sign (+ or -) from the resulting series.
The ﬁrst two terms, 0 and 1 have no sign since they are the
generators. here,
˜ ˜ - + - - - , ˜ is used to represent no sign
9. Arranging the series of signs :
1. Arrange the sign series, as obtained, along with the
augmented and padded plaintext repetitively until it matches
the length of the plaintext and group into pairs as necessary.
2. Scan throughout the sign series thus formed and
consider where there is no sign, as represented by ’˜’.
Alternatively, change pairs of ’˜’ to ’+’ and ’-’ starting with
the ﬁrst pair being changed to ’+’.
3. The plaintext now has a sign assigned to every character and has been grouped into pairs. If in the digram, the
signs are opposite, i.e one is ’+’ and the other is ’-’, only
the position of the signs are interchanged.
10. The digraph substitution is performed as follows:
a. if the associated sign is ‘+’, trace forward with
wraparound.
b. if the associated sign is ‘-’, trace backward with
wraparound.

2. Select a keyword or a keyphrase. The symmetric key
(represented by K) for the cipher technique is the prime
number appended to the keyword or the keyphrase and then
reduced to its distinct characters.
3. Construction of the matrix :
a. The cells of the matrix are ﬁrst ﬁlled with the characters of the key(K) in row major order starting with the ﬁrst
row.
b. The remaining empty cells of the matrix are ﬁrst ﬁlled
alternately with the remaining elements from the decimal
digit set and the special character underscore (‘_’) in its
(matrix) alternate positions.
c. The remaining cells of the matrix are then ﬁlled with
the remaining elements from the alphabet set. In this case
also, ‘Q’ is opted out due to the same reason as in Playfair
cipher.
We could, however, include ’Q’ and consider ’I’ and
’J’ to exist together in one cell; performance will not vary
noticeably.
4. Augment, pad and rewrite the plaintext as necessary
as per Playfair cipher.
5. Generate the ﬁrst ν terms in the Fibonacci sequence
and keep only the distinct prime numbers.
6. Calculate the ratio of one term to its preceding
term among the remaining terms of the sequence. It is
represented by the Greek symbol Rho, ρ.

ρ=

F (n)
F (n − 1)

5.1.2. Decryption . The decryption procedure requires the
listener (one to whom the message is sent) to have prior
knowledge about the chosen key phrase and the chosen
prime number.
With the help of the key combination and the skill set
to construct the required matrix and generate the list of
symbols with the golden ratio and Fibonacci sequence, the
following rules are used to decrypt the message.
1. Rewrite the ciphertext devoid of spaces and arrange
as digrams.
2. Arranging the series of signs :
a. Arrange the sign series, as obtained after constructing
the table as in Table 2, along with the ciphertext repetitively
until it matches the length of the ciphertext and group into
pairs as necessary.
b. Scan throughout the sign series thus formed and
consider where there is no sign, as represented by ’˜’.
Alternatively, change pairs of ’˜’ to ’+’ and ’-’ starting with
the ﬁrst pair being changed to ’-’.
c. If in the digrams the signs are the opposite to one
another, i.e. one is ’+’ and the other is a ’-’, do not change
the signs; in all other cases, change ’-’ to ’+’ and vice versa.
3. The digraph substitution is performed as follows:
a. if the associated sign is ’+’, trace forward with
wraparound.
b. if the associated sign is ’-’, trace backward with
wraparound.

7. Calculate the offset, the difference of ρ from φ. It is

Figure 9. Assumed inputs for the proposed model

Playfair cipher can be easily broken if sufﬁcient text is
available. Obtaining the key is comparatively easy if both
the plaintext and the cipheretext are known.
When only the cipher text is known, the primary attempt
to crack the code is a brute-force [14] approach. In this case,
the frequency of occurrence of digrams in the cipher text is
tallied against the frequency of occurrence of digrams in
the assumed language. One thing to note is that a digram
and its reverse (e.g. XY and YX) will always decrypt to the
same letter pattern (e.g. RP and PR). Identifying repetition in
digrams and their near about reversed patterns and matching
them against a list of known plaintext words is a probable
beginning for the construction of the key.
Another approach to crack a Playfair cipher is the hill
climbing [15] method where a random combination of the
letters of the alphabet set is assumed to be the cipher
table. The substitutions in the cipher are then performed
to come up with a possible plaintext. A few minor changes
are then made to the square to fork a child combination.
The substitutions are again performed on the ciphertext,
following the same rules, to come up with a better candidate
for the plaintext. The two candidates are then dueled for a
better match for the plaintext and the corresponding square
combination is then updated as the parent square.
In the Playfair cipher, a plaintext digram always enciphers to the same ciphertext digram and this is a major
drawback of the technique.

Keep only the prime numbers from the terms.

The signs are assigned to the terms as per Table 2.

- - ˜˜

Since in the digrams DE, EA and YZ the signs are
opposite, we interchange the position of the signs and obtain
the following. Also, the pairs of ‘˜’ have been changed to
pairs of ‘+’ and ‘-‘ alternatively, starting with a pair of ‘+’.
HI DE TH ED EA DB OD YZ
++ +- -- -+-++
+As per the substitution rule,
H I becomes B T
D E becomes 1 3
T H becomes I S
E D becomes 3 2
E A becomes 4 1
D B becomes 2 H
O D becomes P 1
Y Z becomes Z Y
Hence,
the ciphertext is BT13IS32412HP1ZY.

6.2. Analysis of the proposed model
At the very ﬁrst sight of the proposed changes, the newer
model has a combination of a word or a phrase along with
a number as compared to the single element in the key for
the classical Playfair cipher.

157

2019 4th International Conference on Computational Systems and Information Technology for Sustainable Solution (CSITSS)

This combination has a prime number and this itself
increases the strength of the cipher technique.
Cipher techniques are nowadays implemented in the
social media and the keyword need not be a combination of
letters only. The keyword which is a combination of only
letters of the alphabet set in the classical approach is now
upgraded to bear the same properties as that of an identiﬁer
in a few programming language, i.e. it can have decimal
digits and an underscore ( ‘_’ ) as well.
This increases the maximum number of elements of the
matrix to 36 which is assumed to be a 6x6 matrix for
simplicity of computation.
The classical approach has 625 possible diagrams on
each substitution out of which one is the true one with
a probability of 0.0016. The proposed approach has 1296
choices for each diagram and there are 12 prime numbers
under 36 (considering 1 as prime) as follows,
1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31
Hence, in the proposed model, the probability of guess1
ing a correct combination during an attack is 12
times lessers
than getting a correct combination in the classical approach.
A combination in this discussion is a choice of key word or
a key phrase. In both the approaches, even if the choice1 for
the key word or the key phrase is same, the proposed model
has a prime number attached to it during the formation of the
matrix and thus the chances decrease by 12 for brute-force
attack where the approach is guessing a key word.
In the proposed model the same digram in the plaintext does not always encipher to the same digram in the
ciphertext. This is due to the pseudo-random2 sign series
as generated in Table 2. Hence, chosen-ciphertext attack
approach would not generate the correct plaintext and cannot
be easily cracked.
The statistics shown in Figures 14 and 15 are as tested
on passcode.org.

1,556,964.

The Playfair Cipher is easily breakable when sufﬁcient
ciphertext is available since a digram always enciphers to
the same pair of characters. This problem has been solved
where the user chooses a prime number, almost randomly.
The proposed model is less vulnerable to attacks than the
classical Playfair Cipher. Brute force attacks on the proposed
model will take more time than that on the Playfair Cipher.
Further research and inclusion of modern cyptographic techniques on this proposed model with strengthen the algorithm
and portray for practical usage.

1. In both the approaches, a key word selected in either, having the same
length, has equal probability of being chosen, essentially because they are
selected from the same alphabet set.
2. This is not completely random since there is a limitation to the choice
of the prime number and the sign series does repeat after certain length.

Abstract— Edge-Cloud-of-Things (ECoT) is a model that
facilitates the communicating nodes with the necessary
resources for the data transmissions. The data transmitted in
ECoT is done through the nearby IoT devices over the
network. This data gets forwarded from edge devices to the
heterogeneously distributed edge servers or cloud servers.
Therefore, there is a need to ensure privacy of this data along
the transmission path. We propose an ElGamal-based PrivacyPreserving Scheme (EPPS) for Edge-Cloud-of-Things to ensure
data privacy. ElGamal encryption method is an asymmetric
key cryptography based on Diffie-Hellman key exchange, in
which the same data results in different ciphertext for each
encryption. Due to the nature of this encryption, the privacy is
believed to be increased compared to the other techniques.

Abstract—Click fraud refers to the practice of generating
random clicks on a link in order to extract illegitimate revenue
from the advertisers. We present a generalized model for
modeling temporal click fraud data in the form of probability
or learning based anomaly detection and time series modeling
with time scales like minutes and hours. The proposed approach consists of seven stages: Pre-processing, data smoothing, fraudulent pattern identiﬁcation, homogenizing variance,
normalizing auto-correlation, developing the AR and MA models and ﬁne tuning along with evaluation of the models. The
objective of the proposed work is to ﬁrst, model multi-timescale time series data on AR/MA by relying only on time and
the label without the need of too many attributes and secondly,
to model different time scales separately on Auto-regression
(AR) and Moving Average (MA) models. Then, we evaluate the
models by tuning forecasting errors and also by minimizing
Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information
Criteria (BIC) to obtain a best ﬁt model for all time scale
data. Through our experiments we also demonstrated that the
Probability based model approach is better as compared to the
Learning based probabilistic estimator model.

the advertiser for pay per click, or the third party websites,
which host these ads. Thus, it becomes imperative here to
distinguish between clicks made for genuine reasons, and
clicks made by scripts or sources that are fraudulent, and
have a motive of beneﬁting a particular party by wrong
means [4], [5]. The Ad network architecture consists of
following components: An Advertiser, Publisher, the Ad
Network, and the clickers (more details are presented in
[4]).
Fraudulent behavior forecasting becomes signiﬁcant in
the modern era, just because of the tremendous amount of
data available in order to ﬁnd out the odd observation. In our
case, the goal is to ﬁnd out the probability of a click being
fraudulent. This can be done by checking the pattern in
which these ads are clicked, so as to validate the legitimacy
of the clicks, and an informative block of data can be
provided to the organizations. These organizations can then
manage complex scenarios by having better insights through
which they can tweak their existing algorithms to prepare
their system better to tackle new and modern attacks in this
domain. This forecasting of fraudulent behavior can help the
ad network and the advertisers in optimizing their businesses
and efﬁciently managing their resources. For an ad network,
knowing the number of valid clicks on the ads in advance
would help them manage their resources efﬁciently. On the
other hand, crucial knowledge on forecasted demand would
help the advertisers to understand the market sentiment on
the basis of their product demand and to alter production to
meet hiked demand or to avoid extra cost when it dips.
The challenges in fraud behavior forecasting are based
on the basic premise of detecting fraudulent clicks effectively. The two signiﬁcant challenges are detailed as follows
: (1) Due to the presence of a broad base of the user group,
and approx. 1.8 billion records in the dataset [4], [6], it
was a computationally intensive task in terms of scalability
to go through a massive chunk of data, and processing it
to achieve experimental results [7]. (2) Since the heuristics
available to distinguish a fraud click from a valid click are
limited, and a botnet could easily impersonate an actual user
and click an ad, effectively classifying clicks as genuine or
fake is logically complex and there is no barrier deﬁned as
a trust based access to authenticate these clicks [8].

Contribution summary: We present a generalized model
for modeling temporal click fraud data. The summary of our
contributions in this work are as follows:
1) Extension of Box-Jenkins [9], [10] and Boroojeni et
al. methodology [11] for modelling of ad clicking
activity forecasting to show the future possible
fraudulent behavior.
2) In our proposed approach, we model multi-timescale seasonality to forecast the fraudulent behavior
in terms of minutes and hours interval.
3) Our proposed approach can be considered as an
extension of Seasonal Auto-regressive Integrated
Moving (SARIMA) model [12].
4) AIC, BIC, and residual errors are used to ﬁne tune
the model.

By evaluating a plethora of related works we arrive at the
conclusion that our work is the very ﬁrst attempt of a multitime-scale time series analysis for click fraud forecasting
using binary labeled imbalanced dataset.

3. Proposed Approach
In an ad network, the click dataset is a collection of
temporal data on a mobile platform. Here temporal data is
a continuous log of click actions performed on certain ads
over a duration. In order to plot this kind of time series
data as a function of its past values, we assume that there
exists a pattern which is recurrent in nature. We assume a
pattern, which we model in order to generate a function,
to identify the fraudulent behavior of clicks using multitime-scaled based prediction. In this section, we propose a
methodology to identify a best time series-based model that
statistically understands the click pattern behavior promptly.
The quality of the ad click time series data is judged based
on the model’s accuracy used to estimate and forecast future
fraudulent click behavior in Ad networks. This kind of
modeling will help the ad networks to take future security measures against possible click fraud activities in their
network. In the proposed approach, we utilize the AIC/BIC
as one of the metric to ﬁgure out a model that represents
the close estimation time series of the observed Ad click
data, to evaluate the process of identifying the best model.
Including AIC/BIC, the proposed approach also takes into
account certain residual time series errors, called forecasting
errors. These errors are used to measure the quality of the
best model whose residual time series is non-deterministic
and checks whether the model accurately ﬁts the observed
data.
In the proposed approach as shown in Figure 1:

2. Related Work
It has been observed that the advent of competition in
the costs set by ad-network is directly proportional to the
increase in revenues. This also suggests that the stability
of prices at the equilibrium level depends on the quality of
the stability of ad networks [13]. There has been a constant
increase in the frauds that are targeted against mobile ads
over the past decade, hitting the Mobile ad industry by huge
costs, which are of the order of billions of dollars, as per a
2013 report [14].
Statistical Models: In [15], various statistical models
were evaluated to identify Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
involved in fraudulent clicks. In [16], statistical models were
used to identify and ﬂag an activity on a Domain Network
Server based on recurring patterns in an interval. In [17],
Feature extraction is done for an app on Android platform
to perform Machine Learning to identify suspicious ads.
In [18], the probability of click fraud is determined based
on Bayesian calculations which are used to set a baseline
to identify genuine users. In [19], reverse ad technique is
applied to separate bot clicks from human clicks. In [20], the
research addresses the problem of zero-access malware by
training a learning model which distinguishes suspicious and
non-suspicious IPs. In [21], non-dynamic wavelets of data
were analyzed using Time domain Analysis to gauge the
pattern of click frauds. In [22], wrapper approach has been
suggested to identify best features for a signiﬁcant improvement in accuracy of the click fraud detection model. In [23],
a simulation of 8 botnets was done to distinguish between
bot and human clicks using machine-induced decision tree.
Other models for Fraud Detection: In [24], focus was
given on revealing crowd frauds in internet advertising using
crowd fraud features. [25], [26] incorporated the concept
of bipartite graph propagation to automate the process of
identifying search engine based click frauds, while [27]
incorporated the same technique in mobile ad fraud. A
graph-based automated mechanism that reﬂects fraudulent
telephone numbers was proposed by the author with the aid
of HITS principle in [28]. In [29], Gaussian distributions
was selected as a parameter to detect click frauds. In [30],
Poisson mixture model is used to detect the abnormalities.

We perform pre-analysis on the data and then
based on pre-analysis, we categorize the data into
6 datasets, each indexed with click time.
Then, we prepare the time series data representing
ads clicks into two variants: time series data based
on (i) learning approach and (ii) probabilistic modeling. In the proposed approach, further steps are
performed on these two variants of time series ads
click data.
Assuming a high probability of positive click behavior (too many download clicks observed with
respect to each attribute) we perform fraudulent
pattern detection to set a prediction threshold value.
To model the time series, we check the homogeneity property of the data to verify the normality and
homogeneity of variance. If it does not hold true,
then we transform the time series to make its variance homogeneous and to balance the normality.
Data Stationary Criteria: (i) We plot the ACF and
PACF plots on different time scales to check the
stationarity property. Here minutes and hours are
the time scales and this step is followed to identify a
non-stationary pattern of the time series data. Gen-

erally, time scales are just like seasonal cycles, calculated weekly, daily, and annually. Here, we considered minutes and hours as our seasonal cycles,
because the time span considered for data collection
was set for four days, which is of a shorter order
than days or weeks. (ii) In order to cross verify the

observations drawn from the ACF and PACF plots,
we apply Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) [31]
and Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS)
[32] tests or Rolling Mean (RM) plots and Rolling
Standard Deviation (RSTD) plots. These statistical
tests are performed to cross validate the stationarity

To train and test the logistic regression model we select
the training and testing data randomly using K-fold cross
validation method. The predicted probability values of each
row is considered as our label to model time series indexed
by click _time. The model accuracy was found to be 96%.

the click _time was considered in minutes and seconds, and
the two time series data are represented by equation 2 and

property of time series data. (iii) In order to remove
non-stationary data in time series, we apply dereferencing and logarithmic transformation on the data.
This step is performed repeatedly until the time
series satisﬁes the tests mentioned above.
Next, we model the AR and MA model using the
transformed time series data based on ACF, PACF,
ADF, KPSS, RM, and RSTD behavior.
Finally, the model is selected and evaluated for the
forecasting of fraudulent and non-fraudulent click
behavior by trying different values of AIC/BIC and
minimizing the residual errors.

3.1. Pre-processing

(1)
Before using the dataset for time series analysis, we
need to pre-process the data. The main challenges in the
dataset were to tackle imbalanced data and to handle the
existence of binary labels. In our experiment, the time series
data should consist of a time-indexed label where the label
should have certain frequency in the values indexed by time.
The accuracy of time series model forecasting also gets
affected by the above considerations. For our experiment,
we have used real-time dataset provided by Kaggle [6]. The
dataset contains 184,903,890 real-time ad click observations
collected on a mobile platform. Though, having an extensive
and a large dataset acts as an excellent source for information analysis, it’s skewed nature towards a particular label
would hamper the accuracy. Hence, based on the IP address
of click and app id, the dataset is divided into six classes
as described in [4]. Among these 6 classes, we chose one
of them for our experiment which consists of 25,974 rows
of click observations. For our experiment, we used an Intel
i7- 8750H CPU at 2.2 GHz, 6 cores with 32 GB RAM,
Jupyter NoteBook Python 3.7. Model train-test-validation
ratio was 80:20. (Detailed information about the dataset and
pre-analysis results are reported in [4])

3.2.2. Probabilistic-based (PB) Modeling. Using equation

The probability of being fraudulent, which includes the
combined impact of all attributes against the output label is
calculated, i.e. P (all) as shown in equation 6.
P (all) = P (is_attributed|ip, app, device, os, channel)
P (ip, app, device, os, channel, is_attributed)

P (ip, app, device, os, channel)

3.2. Data Smoothing
In this section, we describe further steps taken for the
pre-processing of data using smoothing based on the learning and probabilistic models [33] to satisfy homogeneity and
stationarity properties. Due to the binary nature of output
column, we merge various attributes to give us a probability
value, which is considered along with the timestamp in
order to form a time-probability pair using the 2 methods
deﬁned in the subsection. Attributes are eliminated by taking
into account their impact value on the label. In remaining
sections, we examine time series with learning-based output
values and probabilistic-based output values.

We chose the ﬁnal label to be indexed by time using
equation 7 and 8, where we calculate the shortest distance
with LR_P _val and ati where at is any of the attributes

say homogeneity property holds along with the time series
after applying box-cox transformations.

3.5. Time Scales and Stationarity Check
We have considered two-time scales: minutes and hours,
for LBPE and PB model time series. In order to check
the stationarity property, we use ACF and PACF plots on
seasonal data, as it is mandatory for the time series to satisfy
the Wide Sense Stationary (WSS) property [11]. We do this
to verify stationarity of data. In ACF, if in the ﬁrst few lags,
the spikes fall off or decline suddenly exactly at or near
non-seasonal or seasonal cycles, then it means that the data
is stationary. If not, transformation is mandatory to satisfy
the stationarity of the time series. (Due to page limitations,
we have reported lag values form the plots) Table 5 shows
the ACF and PACF lag values.
An obvious way to cross-validate our drawn observation
is to plot RM and RSTD on time series data. If the RM and
RSTD remains constant over time, it indicates stationary
data. Another approach (which we followed) is to perform
the ADF [31] and KPSS [32] tests together on the time
series. These tests are the statistical methods used to check
whether the time series data is stationary or not. ADF test
makes a null hypothesis on the data as it is non-stationary
prior to performing the test where as KPSS test is opposite
of ADF. In ADF test results into ADF statistics value, Pvalue, and critical values. If ADS statistics value is more
negative than the signiﬁcant level values given in table 4
and the P-value is less than the α = 0.05, then it indicates
that the time series is stationary. Otherwise, transformation
is mandatory. In KPSS test results into KPSS statistics value,
P-value, and critical values. If KPSS statistics value is less
than the critical values and the P-value is greater than α =
0.05, then the series is stationary. Otherwise, transformation
is mandatory. There are 4 possible conclusions that can
be derived depending upon different permutations of ADF
and KPSS test results being stationary or non-stationary
as shown in table 2. Table 3 and 4 shows the results of
stationary property check before and after transformation.

3.3. Fraudulent Pattern
Figure 2 shows the probability of a particular observation
being fraudulent on the basis of attributes like channel,
os, ip, app, and device. For plotting the graph, top 20
observations were taken into account, ranked on the basis of
their click counts. In Figure 2, for the top ﬁrst observation,
each color-coded vertical line represents a unique attribute’s
probability of being fraudulent. Likewise, the remaining 19
observations are represented in the same fashion. Based on
the graph, we notice that for most of the top 20 observations,
the average probability of being fraudulent is 0.8. Therefore,
in our work, we take 0.8 as the standard threshold value
above which any given observation is considered as fraud.
There is no industry standard to set the threshold, but we
are hypothesizing the value based on our dataset and results.

3.4. Homogeneity Property

3.6. AR/MA Model’s Construction, Fine-Tuning
and Evaluation

Before initiating work on the AR/MA model, it is important to check whether our data is ready i.e. whether
the homogeneity property holds true. If the property is not
satisﬁed, then we need to apply logarithmic transformations
on data using Box-Cox transformation method [34]. In order
to check the homogeneity, we use statistical hypothesis test
i.e. T-Test [35], [36], [37], [38]. The T-Test adds to the
table, criteria like normality and variance. To satisfy the
T-Test, time series data should have a normal distribution
and a non-varying mean. If not, we need to apply the
transformation until T-Test criteria are satisﬁed. To check
the normality we use the Shapiro-walk [39] and to check
the variance we use Levene variance test [40], where the
results hold the normality and non-varying variance property
if the resulting values after the test are greater than the preset
probability threshold of 0.05. By looking at table 1, we can

Finally, using the transformed time series from the previous step and by observing the ACF and PACF values, we can
estimate the order parameters for AR/MA model. Table 5 of
ACF and PACF illustrates that ACF exhibits a sine wave and
PACF exhibits an exponentially declining wave at lags. In
order to select the best ﬁt models from the set of evaluation
parameters, we use AIC, BIC and forecasting errors. AIC
measures the relative quality of model for a given set of
data, BIC helps to select a model from a ﬁnite set of models,
forecasting errors are the differences between the observed
and expected value which is the value of unpredictability.
Like forecasting errors, we have used scale-dependent errors
like Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error

stationarity property is not satisﬁed, some transformation
techniques are applied. Then by using ACF and PACF plots,
for each time series, we identify the AR and MA terms, and
then we validate our identiﬁed models by checking the least
forecasting errors, AIC and BIC. The error data turns out
to be very minimal, suggesting some white noise. In the
end, our approach produced various models, by minimizing
forecasting errors, AIC and BIC, which we have considered
as a metric to choose the best models, and also showed that
the PB model approach is better as compared to the LBPE
model.

(RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and others like Mean
Error (ME). Table 6 shows the set of models that are chosen
based on the measures mentioned above, after ﬁne-tuning
the model. We presented 2 approaches in the data smoothing
stage: LBPE, and PB modelling. The results obtained in
table 6 clearly suggest that on comparing both approaches
in terms of hours and minutes separately, the PB modelling
approach gives better results than the LBPE approach. This
is evident from the fact that the error values along with the
AIC and BIC obtained by applying the PB model are much
smaller than those obtained by applying the LBPE, which
concludes that the PB model has an edge over the LBPE
model.

4. Conclusion
In this paper, we presented a generalized multi-timescale time series model to forecast click fraud behavior in
terms of minutes and hours. Our proposed approach also
allows us to forecast the behavior in terms of seconds, and
even a smaller timescale could be examined. This is the
very ﬁrst attempt that has been made in this regard, which
deals with forecasting click fraud behavior using AR and
MA time series modelling. In the proposed approach, a raw
dataset with multiple attributes is taken, through which the
probability of being fraud was calculated by applying LBPE
and PB modelling. Using this information, the fraudulent
pattern is identiﬁed, and a threshold value is set in order to
classify the data as fraudulent or not. Next, homogeneity
property of the data is evaluated. If this property is not
satisﬁed, the variance is homogenized, and the normality
is balanced by applying the box-cox transformation to the
data. The data is tailored to account for 2 different timescales
– minutes and hours, and then stationarity of the data is
veriﬁed using ACF, PACF and statistical models. If the

Abstract— Credit cards, while convenient and attractive,
are susceptible to frauds, leading to data and privacy breaches.
Identifying fraudulent transactions in a cost effective and
timely manner is a challenge for companies supplying these
cards. Machine learning models provide an easy method to
quickly identify anomalies in credit card transactions. In this
paper, three models, Random Forest (Learning Trees), Long
Short Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Networks on
HPCC Systems distributed computing platform have been used
to classify a series of transactions as ‘Fraudulent’ or ‘Non
fraudulent’. Although all three models give outstanding
results, Random Forests (Learning Trees) and Convolutional
Neural Networks perform the best, with 0.99 precision, recall
and F1 score.

Another way fraudsters obtain the 16-digit credit card
number is through online data breaches like those suffered by
Target, the PlayStation Network, Home Depot and several
others in recent years. The numbers stolen from those sites
often end up on “carding” shops, where people go to buy
stolen credit card numbers. According to Kerbson Security,
the card numbers sold on Rescator, a card-buying site, go for
a median price of about $27 per card. This makes it easy for
fraudsters to buy hundreds of cards at a time.

Although only one in 1000 transactions are instances of
credit card fraud, they have still resulted in huge financial
losses owing to the large values of transaction. In 1999, 10
million out of the 12 billion transactions (one out of every
1200 transactions) that took place were fraudulent. It was
also reported that 4 out of every 10,000 monthly active
accounts were fraudulent. Since then, due to the developing
technology and increases attention towards this criminal
activity, the rates of fraud have stayed the same, if not
decreased [2].

If the transaction is proved to be fraudulent, the financial
institutions are obliged to compensate the consumers. So, it
is of utmost importance for the financial institutions to
reduce the illegitimate use of credit cards

I. INTRODUCTION
The emergence of credit cards and their improved
functionalities has not only given people comfort and
convenience, it has also paved way for many malicious
characters as it is the easiest way to make huge money in a
short period of time.

Different approaches have been used to identify
fraudulent transactions. One such promising approach is the
use of Machine Learning. A machine learning algorithm can
be applied to identify fraudulent transactions. Many
algorithms have been explored such as K-Nearest
Neighbours, Bayesian algorithm, Support Vector Machines
etc. The objective of this paper is to perform a
comprehensive review of the use of Random Forests (a.k.a
Learning Trees in the HPCC platform), Long Short Term
Memory and Convolutional Neural Network to classify a
series of transactions as fraudulent or not.

Credit card fraud refers to illegal means of obtaining
account information to perform unauthorized transactions on
the compromised account.
It is a form of an identity theft where personal
information of an individual is obtained through illegal
means. Personal information may include name, date of
birth, address, Social Security number, credit card numbers,
PINs and more. This information provides fraudsters the
means to make illegal transactions.
According to the United States Federal Trade
Commission, while the rate of identity theft had been holding
steady during the mid-2000s, it increased by 21 percent in
2008 [1].

HPCC Systems, an open source platform developed by
Lexis Nexis Risk Solutions, has been used to set up a cluster,
distribute the data and perform all the operations parallelly
for a faster and a more effective computation. HPCC
Systems provide high-performance, parallel processing and
delivery for applications using big data.

There are several ways in which fraudsters can commit
credit card fraud. Phishing is a conventional strategy to get
credit card numbers. Fraudsters get in touch with the victims
through emails, messaging services, fake websites or phone
calls, convince them that they are representatives of their
respective banks and trick them into giving sensitive
information.

II. LITERATURE REVIEW
The idea of using machine learning models to identify
fraud in credit card transactions was first introduced to the

172

2019 4th International Conference on Computational Systems and Information Technology for Sustainable Solution (CSITSS)

world in 2011, by Siddhartha Bhattacharyya et. al [3].
Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Decision
Trees were used to identify fraud. It was concluded that
decision trees gave the best results followed by logistic
regression.

C. Determining the appropriate evaluation metrics
Given that more than 99% of the dataset is a negative
class (non-fraudulent), even if an algorithm predicts that all
transactions are negative, its accuracy will still be 0.99 which
creates an illusion of a good result but in actuality, it is not.

In 2014, Suman, et.al. [4] explored the use of
unsupervised learning to distinguish between legitimate and
fraudulent transactions and compared it with the supervised
models such as Neural Networks, Bayesian Networks and
Decision Trees

IV. DATASET
It is common to come across large and highly
imbalanced datasets when dealing with real world problems.
Credit card fraud detection is one of them, as the number of
fraudulent transactions is miniscule compared to nonfraudulent ones.

J. Esmaily and R. Moradinezhad in their paper published
in 2015 [5], used an amalgamation of Neural Networks and
decision trees to classify a credit card transaction as fraud or
not. A layer of decision tree was followed by two perceptron
layers for classification of the transaction. Very low false
positive rates were achieved through this method.

The dataset used in this paper [9] contains transactions
carried out by European credit cardholders in 2013 over a
period of two days. As shown in figures 1 and 2, of the
284,807 transactions, 492 are fraudulent. The dataset is
highly unbalanced as the positive class (frauds) account for a
mere 0.172% of all transactions [9].

In the same year, Masoumeh Zareapoor and Pourya
Shamsolmoali [6] explored the use of Naïve Bayes, Support
Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors and an ensemble
bagging classifier to detect fraud. It was concluded that the
ensemble bagging classifier performed the best.
Another significant research paper was published in
2016, by Sorournejad, Zojaji, Atani, & Monadjemi [7],
which went into the depths of types of credit card fraud.
Bayesian Networks, Artificial Neural Networks and Decision
Trees were used as fraud detection techniques. The paper
provides a detailed insight into the advantages and
disadvantage of use of each model.
In 2019, after a detailed research on the previous works
on this topic, Yashvi Jain et al. [8] performed an extensive
review and comparative study on the use of Support Vector
Machine, Artificial Neural Networks, Bayesian Network, KNearest Neighbour, Hidden Markov Model, Fuzzy Logic
Based System and Decision Trees. The inference was that
although ANNs give a better accuracy and false alarm rate,
the best trade-off between inexpensive computation and
accuracy is given by the use of Decision Trees.

HPCC Systems platform has been used to handle huge
amount of data and to perform operations on a distributed
system for faster computations.
III. CHALLENGES IN CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
A. Before Non availability of real dataset
One of the biggest challenges of detection of fraudulent
transactions is to find an effective dataset. Neither the data is
freely available, nor can it be scraped from a secondary
source, owing to the fact that companies are not keen on
revealing sensitive customer transactional data.

As seen in figure 3, the dataset is a time series, with Xaxis representing the number of seconds elapsed since the
first transaction (‘Time’ column) and Y- axis representing
the respective transaction amount (‘Amount’ column).

B. Highly imbalanced dataset
In a real-life scenario, less than 0.04% of the transactions
are fraudulent [2]. Hence, any dataset will always be highly
skewed. Special attention is required to handle and train such
data.

Majority of the dataset contains numerical input variables
which are the result of Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

173

2019 4th International Conference on Computational Systems and Information Technology for Sustainable Solution (CSITSS)

transformation. As mentioned in the third section, due to
confidentiality issues, more background information and
original data could not be provided. Features V1, V2, ... V28
are the principal components. The only features which have
not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'.
Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in
case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

class, i.e., the class which has been predicted the most will
be the ultimate classification.
As seen in figure 6, the decision trees are trained on the
training set. The testing set is then classified based on a
voting system.
The main principle behind this algorithm is the wisdom of
crowds. A large number of trees working as a whole will
always outperform a single tree. This is because trees cover
each other’s mistakes and only under rare conditions do
majority of the trees make the same mistake. This accounts
for the high accuracies obtained by this model. Another
advantage of random forests is that they are less prone to
overfitting as compared to the other models.

An example of dataset is shown in figure 4, where a part
of the first five samples are depicted.

Figure 4.

Description of Dataset

V. VARIOUS TECHNIQUES
A.

Learning Trees (Random Forests)

An understanding of the concept of decision tree is a
prerequisite to fully grasp the concept of random forests.
Decision tree is a tree-like structure where each internal
node tests one of the input features, each branch is the
outcome of that test and each leaf node is one of the class
labels. A decision tree is trained to test the input features at
each node such that it travels to the correct class label. This
is clearly illustrated on a sample Decision Tree in figure 5.

Figure 6.

B.

Voting system in Random Forests [10]

Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning
model which is generally used for image recognition or
classification. It accepts a 2D array of the image, processes
it and trains itself. Of late, 1D CNNs are now being used
univariate or 1D Convolutional Neural Networks are being
used to classify time series and text segments.
1D CNNs specialize in finding patterns in shorter
segments of data where the locality of the features in that
segment is not of relevance.
Hence, 1D CNNs are an interesting approach to Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and for the analysis of signal
sampled over a fixed length of time.
Figure 5.

Decision Tree

Once the decision tree has learnt the tests, an input will
now travel down the tree through a unique path and finally
land in a classification.
Learning Trees, like the name implies, is a collection of
decision trees, that operates as an ensemble. Each tree
randomly picks a subset of the features from the input and
classifies it. A voting system is then used to predict the final

Figure 7.

1 dimensional Convolutional Neural Network [11]

In a 2D CNN, a smaller 2-dimensional feature detector
iterates through the 2D input to extract features. Similarly,
in a 1D CNN, a feature detector which covers the entire
individual input and a specified number of such inputs in the
series is covered at a time by the feature detector. This can
be clearly seen in figure 7, where, for a series of nine inputs,
two inputs are covered at a time by the feature detector.
C.

Figure 8.

Long Short Term Memory [12]

As seen in Figure 8, LSTM essentially has two inputs.
Xt, which is the current input and ht-1, which is the previous
output and one output ht. The memory cell is controlled by
the forget valve (gate) and new memory valve (gate).
Forget gate is a neural network with the sigmoid
activation function which is multiplied with the previous
memory to decide how much of the previous memory is to
be remembered. New memory gate is a neural network
which is similar to the forget gate except this decides wo
what extent the new memory should influence the old
memory.
The new memory itself is calculated by a third neural
network, which is followed by a ‘tanh’ activation function.
The output of this neural network is element wise multiplied
with the new memory gate’s output and added to the output
of the element wise product of the forget gate and the old
memory.
Finally, to generate the output of the LSTM node, a
fourth neural network is used to determine how much the
new memory should influence the output and is multiplied
with the tanh activation of the new memory to generate the
output.

Long Short Term Memory

With the recent advancements in machine learning and
data science, it has been observed that Long Short Term
Memory (LSTM) algorithm is a powerful tool for sequence
classification.
LSTM is a variant of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
RNN is an artificial neural network (ANN) where the output
of the current sample is a function of the current input and
the previous outputs. This enables the RNN to
store/remember the previous inputs, and hence is perceived
to have memory.
However, RNNs suffer from the problems of vanishing
and exploding gradient. Hence, LSTM was introduced to
compensate for the disabilities of RNNs.
In LSTM, a memory is included. The cell has the current
memory of the node which can be written into, read and
erased just like a computer memory, with the only
difference being that this cell is analogous.

VI. PLATFORM USED
LexisNexis, an industry leader in data content, data
aggregation, and information services independently
developed and implemented a solution for data-intensive
computing called HPCC (High-Performance Computing
Cluster) Systems.

window will be classified as fraudulent or not and if any of
the window is fraudulent, then the series will be classified as
fraudulent.

Figure 9.

C.
Over-sampling
Over-sampling is the process of adding more instances of
the minority class to the dataset to avoid imbalance. Either
the same instances of the minority classes can be added
again to the dataset or slight changes can be made by adding
noise to each sample before adding it to the dataset.
Motivation to over-sample: With the dataset being highly
skewed, over-sampling is a must for good results. In this
paper, direct over-sampling and over-sampling by adding
noise is done to increase the number of instances of the
minority (fraudulent) class.

Cluster [13]

HPCC Systems platform utilizes commodity clusters of
hardware running the Linux operating system similar to the
cluster depicted in Figure 9. Custom system software and
middleware components were developed and layered on the
base Linux operating system to provide the execution
environment and distributed filesystem support required for
data-intensive computing.

All these steps have been summarized in figure 10.

As there was a need for a new computing paradigm to
address the growing volumes of data, the design approach of
HPCC also includes the definition of a new high-level
language for parallel data processing called ECL (Enterprise
Data Control Language).
VII. PRE-PROCESSING
A.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique which uses
feature eliminations and feature extractions to reduce the
number of variables. The crux of PCA lies in reducing the
dimensionality of the dataset, without compromising on the
accuracy. This ensures there is independence among each
variable without losing information.
Motivation to perform PCA: PCA is performed on this
dataset not only to reduce dimensionality, but to also make
the data less interpretable, so that the confidentiality of
sensitive transactional data is not compromised.

Figure 10.

Pre-Processing

VIII. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
B.
Reconstructing the dataset using a sliding window
The dataset has been re-constructed. A sliding window of
fixed size, which pans through the whole dataset, has been
used to incorporate the previous inputs’ features into the
current input feature for each sample. This has been done by
ensuring that all the data points covered by the sliding
window at each sample is included in its input feature.
Motivation to reconstruct dataset: The ultimate aim of
this model is, given a series of transactions, to classify it as
fraudulent or not. Hence, the models are trained to predict
windows to be fraudulent or not. Any given series of
transactions will be broken down into these windows, each

Figure 11 shows the system architecture. The dataset is
first uploaded to ECL watch, a portal provided by HPCC
Systems. It is then received into a DATASET by a defined
RECORD structure programmatically. This is done to
ensure that the data is sprayed to all the nodes in the cluster.
Next, the data is pre-processed using the techniques
described in the previous section. The dataset is then split
into training and testing data. The training data is fed to the
model for training. Predictions are made on the test data and
then an evaluation is done.
Hyper-tuning is then done by fine tuning the parameters
of the model for better results.

CONCLUSION

As seen in Table 2, the LSTM model gives the least
precision and recall, but is still a good result. CNN and
Learning Trees both produce outstanding results, with
Learning Trees out-performing CNN by a slight margin.
Each sample in the dataset has very few time steps and
hence temporal locality doesn’t have great significance. This
is one of the reasons why LSTM, which gives utmost
importance to the temporal sequence, produces the least
results among the three. 1D CNN on the other hand
specializes in the classification of such shorter sequences
where temporal locality is of less importance. So 1D CNN
performs outstandingly. However, Random Forests also
gives exceptional results, which is marginally better than 1D
CNN owing to the following two reasons. One, Learning
Trees have the least tendency among other models to overfit
the data. This is much needed when training a dataset
having over 280,000 samples. Second, ensemble learning
suppresses the false negatives to a great extent.
To conclude, both Learning Trees and 1D CNN give
good results, with Learning Trees have a slight edge.

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

Since the dataset is highly skewed, if a suitable evaluation
metric isn’t chosen, an illusion of good performance will be
created.
In this paper, precision, recall and F1 scores have been
chosen as the evaluation metrics.
To calculate the above metrics, the number of True
Positives, False Positives, True Negatives and False
Negatives are required.

descriptive sentences stored in the databases. Another
implementation was the class of natural language interface
to database (NLIDB). In the modern class of NLIDB
systems, the input is represented as a parsing tree. The
training pool consists of a pair of parsing trees: the first
tree i.e. Natural Language Tree (NLT) for the sentence in
natural language, the second tree i.e. Structured Query
Tree (SQT) is for the sentence in SQL. There is a
knowledge base to store the relationships between the
nodes of NLT and SQT. In this system, the mapping
between the natural language and the database is used at
the syntactic level and machine learning algorithms are
applied to extract shared semantic relationships [3].
However, if the input contains words that are present in
some description stored in the database, then the
extraction of data requires training of data present in the
descriptive columns followed by feeding the input
sentence into the trained model and extracting the
description. However, even though the method is feasible,
it does result in incorrect mappings due to training errors.
In addition to this, as the data grows larger, the training
becomes harder and the system becomes more prone to
errors.
Another system which was proposed for converting
natural language to SQL was to make use of
reinforcement learning [4]. In this system, user queries are
fed continuously and output depends upon the reward of
the previous outputs. However, this method is time
consuming and requires constant user interaction.
Hence in order to address these drawbacks which
occur for descriptive columns, this paper proposes a
system for identifying clauses that are required to map the
input query with the descriptive columns. The proposed
system makes use of Elasticsearch as it is capable of
performing full-text search functionality. Elasticsearch is
widely used for big-data as it effectively stores optimized
indexes of query terms which is used for full-text search
[5]. Elasticsearch stores data in the form of documents
hence it is schema-less [5]. An index contains multiple
documents and is analogous to a database in RDBMS.
Elasticsearch offers support for NLP as it introduces the
concept of analyzers which is discussed in this paper. It
also provides support for many other languages like
Hindi, German, French etc. [6].

Abstract—In the present day, data is captured in large
amounts in the form of numbers, text, images etc. The data
captured is either very simple to extract any useful
information or it is very complex such that it takes a lot of
time to generate information. In addition to this, data is
being stored either in relational databases like MySQL,
PostgreSQL or in document-oriented databases like
MongoDB, Cassandra. The extraction of data from these
databases requires some special knowledge of writing
queries that are designed for that particular database.
Hence there is a need for a system which extracts
information from an input natural language query and
convert it into a query which can be understood by the
database in a fast and an efficient way. This paper proposes
a way to create such a system by making use of
Elasticsearch which is used for extracting data from
descriptive columns. This paper is mainly focused on
creating optimized SQL queries from natural language
inputs using Elasticsearch where the extraction of data
happens by means of searching through keywords present
in input query throughout all the descriptive columns.
Keywords—Natural Language Query, SQL Query,
Natural language processing, Elasticsearch, Stop Analyzers,
Language Analyzers.

I. INTRODUCTION
Many applications in the present day make use of data
from databases in order to extract useful information.
Retrieving data from databases requires knowledge of
syntax of the queries of that database. As the syntax is not
known to everyone, hence there is a need for converting
natural language input query into SQL query. There are
various systems which have been proposed for generating
SQL queries from natural language.
A review of the systems which have already been
proposed indicates that there are several systems which
provide similar solutions. One of the first implementations
is Quepy[1] which makes use of a probabilistic context
free grammar (PCFG) [2]. However, the system is fixed to
a set of input queries which are to be used by the user. In
addition to this, the system does not handle those queries
where the input contains words present in some
description stored in the database in the form of a
sentence. Hence useful data is lost which is present in

request body for performing a search across multiple
columns is as follows -

II. PROPOSED SYSTEM
The proposed system is designed for extracting
information from descriptive columns. Descriptive columns
generally contain information in the form of sentences.
These sentences generally describe the specific data to a
greater context. The data from the database is converted to
a .csv file by making use of Apache Commons CSV API[7].
This API is used for writing into a .csv file. The column
names of the tables in the database is being added as the
heading of columns in .csv file. This .csv file is being fed
into the Elasticsearch so that the data is stored as an index.
This is done with the help of Bulk API [8] of Elasticsearch.
In Python, this is supported by the ‘Helpers’ [9] module in
the Elasticsearch Python plugin which is a collection of
functions which abstracts the specifics of the Bulk API. The
Bulk API is necessary for indexing large amounts of data.
The advantage of using Bulk API is that it indexes data in
chunks rather than indexing data one-by-one. A natural
language sentence is passed as the input for our system. The
input query generally contains few keywords which should
be mapped to specific descriptions in descriptive columns.
The input sentences are being made to pass through these
steps in order to retrieve the necessary information:

{
“query”: {
“multi_match”: {
“query”: input query,
“fields”:[list of descriptive column
names];
}
}
}
In this JSON request body, the ‘input query’ is the query
which is processed from analyzers mentioned above. ‘fields’
contain the list of column names through which the input
query has to be searched.
Ex: If input query is: List all products which are mountain
bikes.
Analyzer output is: list all product which mountain bike
Hence the request body is:
{
“query”: {
“multi_match”: {
“query”:“list all product which
mountain bike”,
“fields”: [‘CustomerDescription’,
‘ProductDescription’];
}
}
}

A. Analyzers
The input sentence is made to pass through analyzers which
are built within Elasticsearch. Analyzers are a set of rules
which are used to change the text to a given format which
can be used for further processing. There are different types
of analyzers, the default being the standard analyzer.
Analyzer can also be created according to the needs of the
application. The proposed system make use of “Stop”
analyzer [10] and “English language” analyzer [6].

In this example, the input query is being searched across
‘CustomerDescription’ and ‘ProductDescription’ fields of the
index.

1) Stop Analyzer - The Stop analyzer breaks text into
terms whenever it encounters a character which is not a
letter and lower-cases all the terms. It adds support for
removing stop words. It defaults to using the English stop
words. If there are additional words which are to be
removed then a custom Stop analyzer can also be built
and used.
Ex: Input query: List the customers with mountain bikes.
Stop analyzer output: list customers mountain bikes
Notice that ‘the’ and ‘with’ terms are removed.

The JSON response obtained from Elastic search contains a
field called ‘_source’ which has the description along with its
field name. These two pieces of information is important for
generating the required SQL condition for the retrieval of
useful information. In addition to this, the response body also
contains a relevance score which is denoted by ‘_score’
which is used for understanding how relevant a document is
with respect to the input query. The practical scoring
function [12] is a function which calculates the relevance
score and measures how relevant a given input query is
related to the specific document. The practical scoring
function which is mentioned in Lucene can be described as
follows -

2) English Language Analyzer - The English language
analyzer is an analyzer which converts every word in the
sentence to its root word. This analyzer is used when
there are many documents in the index which has some
words in different tenses. This analyzer brings every
word to its root form and then the sentence can be used
for further processing. In addition to this, it removes all
the stop-words present in the sentence.
Ex: Input query: List all products which are mountain
bikes.
English language analyzer: list all product which
mountain bike
Notice that ‘products’ is being changed to its stem word
‘product’ and ‘bikes’ is changed to ‘bike’.

Where t is the term in the input query.
q is Cosine – similarity of query vectors.
coord(q,d) is a score factor based on how many of the
query terms are found in the specified document.
queryNorm(q) is a normalizing factor used to make
scores between queries comparable.
tf(t in d) is defined as the number of times term t
appears in the currently scored document d.
idf(t) stands for Inverse Document Frequency.
t.getBoost() is a search time boost of term t in the
query q.
norm(t,d) encapsulates a few (indexing time) boost
and length factors.

B. Searching through multiple columns
Elasticsearch provides the necessary functionality to
search against multiple columns. The ‘multi_match’ keyword
[11] is used to search for data from multiple columns. The

180

2019 4th International Conference on Computational Systems and Information Technology for Sustainable Solution (CSITSS)

According to the equation (1), the practical scoring function
depends on frequency of terms in the input query present in a
specific document ‘d’ [13]. Hence if a specific description is
present in many documents, then the score of the description
is increased. Therefore, with growing data the relevance of
commonly occurring descriptions increases which is correct.
Hence, more data must be provided so as to produce better
search results. In addition to this, a specific threshold must be
set for relevance scoring. Values above this threshold must
only be considered for extraction of fieldname-value pairs.
To retrieve maximum results from the input query, multiple
requests can be sent to the Elasticsearch server, each of them
containing multiple fields. Hence, useful ‘WHERE’ clauses
are being retrieved from the descriptive columns.
C. Generating suitable fieldname-value pair in WHERE
clause
Once the fieldname and value is being retrieved from the
input query, a SQL-like statement containing fieldnamevalue pairs is generated as follows WHERE fieldname 1 = value 1 AND fieldname 2 = value2
AND.… fieldname N = value N ;
This statement is later appended to those SQL outputs
obtained by other techniques which do not look towards the
descriptive columns. If no fieldname-value pairs are
generated then it does not append any result to SQL outputs
obtained by other techniques and the output remains
unaffected.

TABLE I.

Experimental Setup
Sl.no

The proposed system is implemented on the database whose
schema is shown in fig (2). The database contains 6 tables.
The database contains data of customers, the products they
have bought and the sales details of each product. The tables
‘t_cstmrs’ contains customer data, ‘t_prds’ contains product
data, ‘t_saldtls’ contains sales data, ‘t_ggrphy’ contains the
geographical location of the customers, ‘t_prdcat’ contains
product-category data and ‘t_prdsubcat’ contains productsubcategory data. The descriptive column present in our
database is the ‘Description’ column in ‘t_prds’ table which
contains description of the products. The input query is
made to search through this column for extracting
information from descriptive sentences by using the above
methods. The flowchart in fig (1) clearly shows the flow of
the processes in the proposed system.
Ⅲ. RESULT AND ANALYSIS
The proposed system was implemented and tested for
various natural language input queries. Out of 50 natural
language input queries that were tested, all of the queries are
mapped to correct description. In addition to this, if an input
query is given which is not corresponding to any documents
of the index, then it will return nothing. It is also observed
that the result returned by the Elasticsearch server takes time
in the order of microseconds hence the retrieval of
information is fast.
Some results that are obtained after implementing the
proposed system is shown in table Ι.
Ⅳ. CONCLUSION
The proposed system architecture gives good results as it
identifies the descriptive columns based on the given input
query. The accuracy of the proposed system is near 100%
with an error percentage of below 1%. The error percentage
can be minimised by setting an appropriate threshold for the
practical scoring function. The proposed system is accurate
and scalable to big amounts of data and it provides fast and
efficient output. The major advantage of this approach is
that there is no explicit training required to identify the
appropriate description. In addition to this, the proposed
system can also be easily integrated with other natural
language to SQL systems which do not handle descriptive
columns. Further, the proposed system can be extended to
other languages as Elasticsearch provides support to other
languages.

data values which isn’t understood by the machine. For
example, let a database maintained by a pet store, have an
entry with ‘pet name’ as ‘Tim’ with a ‘description’ as ‘This is
a fun-loving, black coloured dog, which is 6 months old and
has not yet been vaccinated’. A natural language query asking
for the name of a ‘6-month-old dog, dark in colour’ would be
impossible to convert to the right SQL query, without
understanding the context.

Abstract—There has been an exponential growth in the
amount of data produced daily in recent years, owing to the
widespread use of technology. Ease of access to this data is of
utmost importance in this day and age. Although in the past, use
of structured query languages to query the data stored in the
hard-drive was satisfactory, use of natural language to access the
data is more desired. This paper talks about mapping partial
data values to its corresponding data values and attributes in the
schema to enrich the natural language query. Machine learning
algorithm, Long Short Term Memory, preceded by an
Embedding layer has been used on the HPCC Systems platform.
The resulting model gives an accuracy of 99.6%, while its
implementation with the experimental setup gives an accuracy
of 92%.

In this paper, a machine learning algorithm, Long Short
Term Memory, preceded by an Embedding layer has been
used, to map a partial data value to its corresponding data
value and attribute. The goal of the model is, given a string,
return the corresponding data value and attribute, if present in
the schema, otherwise return null. This model can hence be
used to enrich the natural language query and thereby aid in
the precise conversion of the natural language to SQL query.

I. INTRODUCTION

High-Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC), an open
source platform developed by LexisNexis Risk Solutions, has
been used to set up a cluster, distribute the data and perform
all the operations parallelly for a faster and a more effective
computation. HPCC Systems provide high-performance,
parallel processing and delivery for applications using big
data.

Data is any collection of information, in the form of text or
numbers, which has been translated into a format that can be
processed by a computer. Collection of data has revolutionized
almost every field in the recent past. Detection of cancerous
tumours, prediction of stocks, deciding which crop to be
grown on a given land and identifying fraud in credit card
transactions are some of the wonders that have been made
possible with the collection of data.

II. LITERATURE REVIEW
The concept of converting a natural language query to an
SQL query was first introduced in 1992, by Nikolaus Ott et al
[1] where natural language queries were mapped to an SQL+
language, an augmented SQL language.

With great importance being given to ‘big data’ in this
millennial, the storage and the ease of access to this data
becomes crucial. One of the popular methods to store and
access data is the use of Structured Query Language (SQL).
SQL is a domain-specific programming language, designed to
manage structured data held in relational databases. SQL
provides multiple statements to query, manipulate and store
the data in a structured manner.

A concrete method for conversion was introduced by
Alessandra Giordani et al [2] in the year 2012. Linguistic
dependencies and meta-data were used to build sets of
WHERE and SELECT and combine them to form a set of SQL
queries. The right query was found to be within the first five
output queries 88% of the time.

Only professionals, having experience in this field could
access and manipulate big data. But now, with technology
decreasing the gap between individuals and data, an easier
access to this data is deemed necessary. Hence, models are
being built to make natural language an interface between
humans and the data stored in computers.

In 2014, Prasun Kanti Ghosh et al [3] explored the use of
morphological analysis, lexical analysis, syntactic analysis
and semantic analysis to generate an SQL query from a natural
language query. In the same year, K. Javubar et al [4] used
morphological, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic analysis

One of the main hurdles of converting a natural language
to an SQL query is that the natural language will have partial

along with discourse integration to convert natural language to
SQL queries for semantic knowledge extraction from web
sources.
In 2018, Amit Pargut et al [5], used various Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as Tokenization,
Parts of Speech Tagging, Stemming and Lemmatization to get
the statement in the desired form to convert the natural
language query to a MySQL query. A decent accuracy of 82%
was achieved.
The Long Short Term Memory model used in this paper,
was introduced in 1997 by Sepp Hochreiter et al [6]. It is a
variant of Recurrent Neural Networks having an internal
memory cell in each node
One common area where all the above stated techniques
fail to convert a natural language query to an SQL query is
when, instead of the entire data value present in the schema is
to be mentioned in the natural language input, only a part of it
is mentioned or implied. The objective of this paper is to
provide a solution to this model by using a machine learning
algorithm to identify and solve such failure cases.

Word Embeddings [7]

C. Long Short Term Memory
With the recent advancements in machine learning and data
science, it has been observed that Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) algorithm is a powerful tool for sequence
classification.

III. CONCEPTS
A. Structured Query Language

LSTM is a variant of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
RNN is an artificial neural network (ANN) where the output
of the current sample is a function of the current input and the
previous outputs. This enables the RNN to store/remember
the previous inputs, and hence is perceived to have memory.

Structured Query Language (SQL) is an ANSI/ISO
standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.
It is a domain-specific programming language and is designed
to manage structured data held in relational databases.

However, RNNs suffer from the problems of vanishing and
exploding gradient. Hence, LSTM was introduced to
compensate for the disabilities of RNNs.

SQL, although classified as a declarative language, has a
few procedural elements as well. Some of the features of SQL
are as follows.
1. Can create databases
2. Can insert, update and delete records in
databases
3. Can execute queries against databases
4. Can retrieve required data from databases
5. Can create stored procedures

In LSTM, a memory is included. The cell has the current
memory of the node which can be written into, read and
erased just like a computer memory, with the only difference
being that this cell is analogous.

B. Embedding Layer
A word embedding is a class of approaches for representing
words using a dense vector representation. The use of an
embedding layer is an improvement over the naïve way of
encoding the unique words present in the vocabulary into
large vectors.
In an embedding, words are represented by dense vectors
where a vector represents the projection of the word into a
continuous vector space. The positions of the vectors for
each word is learnt based on its surrounding words in the
given corpus.
The use of embedding layer before the LSTM model
hence gives context to the input samples. This can be clearly
seen in figure 1, where the male-female relationship, and the
verb tense relationships have been recognized while
projecting the words.

Figure 2.

Long Short Term Memory [8]

2019 4th International Conference on Computational Systems and Information Technology for Sustainable Solution (CSITSS)

As seen in Figure 1, LSTM essentially has two inputs. X t,
which is the current input and h t-1, which is the previous
output and one output h t. The memory cell is controlled by
the forget valve (gate) and new memory valve (gate).

V. DATASET EXTRACTION
The major hurdle faced while training a machine learning
model for this problem statement is the unavailability of a
suitable dataset. To overcome this, a dataset is created based
on the given schema.

Forget gate is a neural network with the sigmoid activation
function which is multiplied with the previous memory to
decide how much of the previous memory is to be
remembered. New memory gate is a neural network which is
similar to the forget gate except this decides wo what extent
the new memory should influence the old memory.

The schema along with the markers for columns which
need a partial search (ex: Description, Experience etc) is taken
as an input. The marked columns of the schema are then
converted to a CSV file using the Apache Common CSV
library. This is used as a dataset for the algorithm.

The new memory itself is calculated by a third neural
network, which is followed by a ‘tanh’ activation function.
The output of this neural network is element wise multiplied
with the new memory gate’s output and added to the output
of the element wise product of the forget gate and the old
memory.

VI. PRE-PROCESSING
A. Obtaining unique values and reconstruction of dataset
The data extracted is a set of columns of the input schema.
To format this into a dataset, the first step is to obtain the
unique values of each column (which forms the temporary
feature matrix) and the target value for each sample shall be
the data value and the corresponding attribute (column name)
separated by a place-holder value. This is done in order to
avoid an expensive search after prediction to determine the
attribute the partial data value belongs to.

Finally, to generate the output of the LSTM node, a fourth
neural network is used to determine how much the new
memory should influence the output and is multiplied with
the tanh activation of the new memory to generate the output.
IV. PLATFORM USED

B. Tokenization of dataset
The machine learning algorithm being used takes integers
as inputs. Therefore, the strings in the feature matrix are split
into words, and each word in the entire dataset is assigned a
unique integer. The training samples now contain variable
number of integers.

LexisNexis, an industry leader in data content, data
aggregation, and information services independently
developed and implemented a solution for data-intensive
computing called HPCC Systems (High-Performance
Computing Cluster) Systems.

C. Label Encoding and One-hot encoding
The target vector still consists of strings having the data
value and its corresponding attribute appended to it. A label
encoder is first used to converting these strings into unique
integer labels. The labels are then one hot encoded, i.e. each
integer value is represented as a binary vector.
This format is more suitable to input to the Long Short
Term memory mode.

Figure 3.

D.Random sampling
Iterating through each sample, we randomly choose a
variable number of tokens/integers (the range of which is
calculated based on the length of the sample) for a fixed
number of times (based on the number of samples) and
appended to the dataset along with its target value. Note,
while randomly chosen tokens must be in the same order as
seen in the original sample.

Cluster [9].

HPCC Systems platform utilizes commodity clusters of
hardware running the Linux operating system similar to the
cluster depicted in Figure 2. Custom system software and
middleware components were developed and layered on the
base Linux operating system to provide the execution
environment and distributed filesystem support required for
data-intensive computing.

E. Padding and truncation
Since each sample now contains variable number of
tokens, it is padded with trailing zeros. The length of each
sample is then truncated to the 75th quartile of the lengths.
This is done to ensure that all samples have a fixed number of
features/tokens without much of it being the padded zeros.

As there was a need for a new computing paradigm to
address the growing volumes of data, the design approach of
HPCC Systems also includes the definition of a new highlevel language for parallel data processing called ECL
(Enterprise Data Control Language).

All these steps have been summarized in Figure 4

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

Figure 5 shows the system architecture. The dataset is
first extracted from the input schema as mentioned in
section V. The dataset is then transformed into a suitable
format and pre-processed as mentioned in section VI.
Figure 5. System Architecture

The dataset is then randomly split into training and test
data (a low train-test split ratio is recommended).
IX.

The training data is given as the input to the embedding
layer to learn and project the words into a suitable vector
space. This is followed by an LSTM model and an output
dense layer.

RESULTS

The dataset used is the ‘Description’ column of the
database described in the previous section. It has over 60,000
data values, each being a string of sentences describing a
product. The model gives a test accuracy of 99.6%. That is,
given a partial data value (description), it is mapped to the
right data value 99.6% of the time.
To demonstrate the integration of this model and its usage,
the algorithm discussed in this paper was integrated with a
natural language to SQL query conversion model built for
this purpose. 50 input queries were formulated which tested
the partial searching capability of the model. Out of the 50,
46 queries were correctly mapped to the correct data value,
attribute and hence, SQL query. Table 1 shows some of the
input queries and its output.

Predictions are made on the test data and then an
evaluation is done. Hyper-tuning is then done by fine tuning
the parameters of the model for better results.
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
VIII.
The proposed system is implemented on the database
whose schema is shown in figure (2). The database contains 6
tables. The database contains data of customers, the products
they have bought and the sales details of each product. The
tables ‘t_cstmrs’ contains data of customer, ‘t_prds’ contains
product data, ‘t_saldtls’ contains sales data, ‘t_ggrphy’
contains the geographical location of the customers, ‘t_prdcat’
contains data of product-category and ‘t_prdsubcat’ contains
data of product-subcategory. The descriptive column present
in our database is the ‘Description’ column in ‘t_prds’ table
which contains description of the products.

X.

CONCLUSION

Use of Embedding layer helps understand the context and
hence infer the meaning of the input and map it to its implied
data value. The Long Short Term Memory model identifies
the patterns in the series of words in the dataset and can
hence successfully map the input strings to the correct data
values if present. Hence the model gives outstanding results,
can understand the context as well as the patterns in the
specified columns.

$EVWUDFW²With thousands of books across hundreds of
disciplines present in a library, manual allocation of books is
both time consuming, human intensive, as well as inefficient in
terms of monetary costs. The presence of manual labour while
providing employment to a section of society tends to slow down
the process of lending in addition to increasing the probability
of errors. The proposed research work attempts at automating
the library book management system there by reducing latency
and long queues as well as the potential of making mistakes in
the distribution of books. Recent advancements of deep neural
networks have improved textual recognition in natural scenes.
The system proposed employs a neural network model for text
detection and recognition, having the potential to reduce and
even eliminate manual labour performed by the staff. This
paper attempts to investigate neural networks for the
application of library management by proposing our own
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and text matching
algorithms. This task further introduces challenges such as
getting the exact name of the book as well as dealing with
distorted images and varied backgrounds. The system thus
developed performs very well with book covers producing
results over 60% in accuracy against current models that
provide about 40% thereby making the system achieve state of
the art performance on book cover information retrieval.

Abstract— In this paper, we propose to explain the
application of automated ground vehicles as delivery robots.
This system is developed and designed with the intended
application being delivery of items within large campuses
and buildings. The system proposed in this paper uses
Google maps and direction API for getting the navigation
data, but the same can be implemented without using third
party application if the map of the intended area of usage is
available. Donkey and carrot algorithm has been developed
and used for navigation using the data obtained from the
used API. To get the data on to the unmanned ground
vehicle, a server is set up on the onboard microcontroller
which gets the data from the cloud, on which further
processing is done.

I. INTRODUCTION
Ashumansocietyisprogressingtowardsmoresophisticated
methods of improving life standards, it is still not in a very
able state to protect its community from the detrimental
effectsofcriminalactivities.AccordingtotheUnitedNations’
2030 agenda for sustainable development, “There can be no
sustainable development without peace and no peace without
sustainable development” [1]. This statement is in itself a
complete summary of how important it is in today’s world
to prevent crime and promote peace. Crime can be as small
as a roadside theft or as dangerous as a homicide, and
very often most crimes arise from multiple causes such as
a troubled childhood, influenceof delinquentpeers,poverty,
unemployment, drug abuse etc. [2].
The depictions in [3] encompasses research that affirmsa
declineincrimewithanincreaseinpoliceforce.However,in
countries like India with a much lower police to population

ratio than the United Nations’ standard [4], it is of greater use
to identify methods to effectively distribute police force among
districts based on each district’s susceptibility to be affected
by crime. The regions that have high chances of vulnerability
to crimes can be termed as “Crime Hotspots” [5].
The main goal of this work is inclined towards using data
science as a means of promoting social good by providing a
methodology to alleviate the effect of crime. This is done by
laying foundations to a system that would help the police force
to judiciously distribute their resources among regions based
on the individual regions’ chances of being prone to crime on a
particular day, in a particular month, at a particular hour. We
have used a variant of the OSEMN(Obtain, Scrub, Explore,
Model, Interpret) framework [6] in order to perform accurate
data analysis and create efﬁcient models of computation. The
entire code for this research is written in python and the
pandas, seaborn, sklearn packages have been used extensively
for obtaining results.
In the remainder of this paper, Section II discusses related
work in the domain, Section III describes the problem in
consideration, Section IV delineates the methodology used,
Section V unearths the ﬁndings and results and ﬁnally Section
VI summarizes the work and emphasises its scope in Indian
context.
II. R ELATED W ORK
The use of computer science as a discipline in unearthing
patterns in crime has been explored many times before and has
resulted in signiﬁcant amount of work being performed on the
same. While works such as that by Ashokan et. al. [7] focus
on a speciﬁc type of crime, several other works concentrate on
crime as a singular entity. Data sets such as the Chicago crime
data set(used in our work) are well maintained and updated
frequently, providing researchers access to data that can help
deﬁne and solve pervasive problems related to maintaining
peace and order.
Sathyadevan et. al. [8] collected data related to crime from
sources such as the web, social media and news sites to gener-

ate an unstructured dataset, and analysis was performed using
MongoDB as a database. Supervised and apriori algorithms
were used to predict regions with high crime probability.
Almanie et. al. [9] performed extensive exploratory data
analysis to unearth patterns of two different crime datasets of
both Denver and Los Angeles. Apriori algorithms were later
used to predict future crime locations. The varied nature of
these predictions on either dataset were discussed. Das et. al.
[10] discussed the geo-statistical spatial clustering technique
to identify criminal hotspots in the context of Indian crime
data. The paper performed forecasting techniques to predict
crime hotspots for the next year given past data. Yu et. al.
[11] performed the task of crime hotspot mapping with special
focus to bruglary. The paper used machine learning algorithms
and deep learning approaches on different training samples
to converge to a best possible solution, with neural network
giving the best possible accuracy of about 88%. Shekhar et. al.
[12] produced an interesting spatio-temporal analysis of crime
and provided basis for an approach to using crime data to
mitigate the effects of crime in the indian context. The paper
based its work on Kolar, a small town in the Indian state of
Karnataka and identiﬁed criminal activity in the town using
geo-spatial mapping.
But in the end, the dichotomy of most crime related data
mining works performed classify the computed results into two
classes which indicate whether a particular crime is going to
occur or not. Even though a few applications manage to get
this done with satisfactory accuracies, minimal work has been
done in classifying the hotspots into multiple classes based on
the odds of occurrence of crimes at a particular hotspot given
a particular space in time.
Our work aims at performing such a division into multiple
classes and will help prioritize the hotspots and aid in judicious
distribution and use of staff which is of utmost concern in a
country like India where the police force is much less than
sufﬁcient. In a nutshell, our work aims to greatly help out the
precincts with shortage of working staff.
III. P ROBLEM D ESCRIPTION
The scope of this work is to analyze crime data and identify
crime hotspots or regions of heightened criminal activity in a
given month, on a given day, at a given hour. The original
dataset used in this paper is the Chicago Crime Dataset
presented in the City of Chicago Data Portal [13]. The dataset
consists of all crime records in the city of Chicago from 2001
to present. The dataset is updated on a daily basis. In this work,
we have used the data from the years 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018
and 2019 (records till 05/05/19). We describe methods to preprocess the data, compress it to reshape the dataset into a better
suited form for our analysis, prepare the training and test data
explicitly and ﬁnally we train machine learning algorithms
to classify entries as crime hotspots based on the intensity
of crimes in those regions in the past during a speciﬁc time
point. A time point according to our work is a one-dimensional
vector that is organized of the values of month, day and hour
(1). Our proposed algorithms use these time points to classify

each of the districts in the dataset as low crime rate, medium
crime rate or high crime rate areas for each speciﬁc time point.

The problem is essentially a supervised multi-class classiﬁcation problem having class imbalance [14]. The next section
will shed some light on the implementation details and the
theory behind our work.
IV. M ETHODOLOGY
In this work, we have employed a data science process that
closely derives from the OSEMN framework as followed in
[15] in order to beget the best possible analysis and results
from the data. The OSEMN framework is a popular data
science process that follows the step-wise methodology of
Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model and Interpret. We have used
the Obtain, Scrub, Explore and Model aspects of OSEMN as
in Fig. 1.
A. Obtain Data
The original training dataset for our project has been obtained from the City of Chicago Data Portal and consists of
11,46,382 entries and 22 features. The main features are Date,
Block, Primary Type, Location, Arrest, District and Year. Out
of the 22 features, 2 are of boolean, 7 are of ﬂoat, 3 are of
integer and 10 are of string data types. This dataset contains
the records of all the crimes that were reported as ﬁrst-hand
accounts in Chicago from 2015 to 2019 (till May). Apart from
this, data from 2012 to 2014 were used to create one of the
testing samples.
B. Scrub Data
This section has further been divided into subsections for
ease of understanding.
a) Getting rid of missing values: Missing values in a
dataset is a common factor leading to poor model performance.
As we had a relatively clean dataset, there were not too many
missing values in concern. The missing information accounted
for only a small portion of the complete data and therefore,
entries with missing data were removed and 98.55% of the
data was retained.

b) Feature Engineering: First it was important to
process the “Date” feature into a form suitable for writing
python code. After this processing, we feature engineered [16]
the separate features of “M onth”, “Day” and “Hour”, since
the “Date” feature in our original dataset was a combination
of the month of the crime, the day of the crime and the time
of the crime. This was achieved by using the apply() function
of the pandas package [17] and python’s datetime module [18].
data[Date] ← changeT oDatetime(data[Date])
data[M onth] ← data[Date].extractM onth()
data[Day] ← data[Date].extractDay()
data[Hour] ← data[Date].extractHour()
c) Compressing the dataset: The dataset was then
compressed and reshaped into a new dataset. This new dataset
has been named as crimeDat in all further discussions in this
work. crimeDat was the ﬁnal dataset that was used in our
work. Following is the pseudocode for creating crimeDat.
In the code, data is our dataset before compression and
reshaping.
cols ← [M onth, Day, District, Hour]
crimeDat ← data.groupby(cols)
crimeDat ← crimeDat.aggregateByCrimeCount()
crimeDat ← crimeDat.descSort(by = District )

Fig. 2. Distribution of Crimes

within 0.75 standard deviations of the mean of the distribution,
crimeDat[Alarm] got 1(Medium alarm). Anything less than
these were classiﬁed as 0(Low alarm) and anything more
than these were classiﬁed as 2(High alarm). The following
pseudocode describes how the target labels are set.

if crimeDat[CrimeCount] ≤ 14 then
crimeDat[Alarm] ← 0
end if
if crimeDat[CrimeCount] ≥ 15 and ≤ 33 then
crimeDat[Alarm] ← 1
end if
if crimeDat[CrimeCount] ≥ 34 then
crimeDat[Alarm] ← 2
end if

At this point, crimeDat has 44,361 entries and 5 features
(M onth, Day, District, Hour, CrimeCount). The ﬁrst 5
entries of crimeDat are given in Table I.
C. Explore
A new target feature crimeDat[Alarm] was then
engineered for the crimeDat dataset . The target feature had
the values 0, 1 or 2 based on the alarm rate of a particular
entry.
Labelling a particular entry as 0(Low alarm), 1(Medium
alarm) or 2(High alarm) is a process that would be subjectively
different from approach to approach. In our approach, we have
plotted a histogram as in Fig. 2 that shows the distribution
of the values in crimeDat[CrimeCount]. The distribution
bears a close resemblance to the normal distribution. We used
this distribution to come up with an intuitive classiﬁcation of
entries that are within crimeDat. We classiﬁed all entries
such that for values in crimeDat[CrimeCount] that occur

Fig. 3 describes the correlation matrix [19] between the
features in crimeDat and the following conclusions can be
drawn of it :
• Almost all the features have no correlation with each
other. This is good as certain machine learning algorithms
are affected adversely by multi-collinearity.
• The feature Hour has the greatest positive correlation
with the target feature Alarm.
Fig. 4 describes the class imbalance involved in our problem. A class imbalance occurs in a classiﬁcation algorithm
when the number of samples of each class type is signiﬁcantly
different for each class. In our problem, the number of
samples classiﬁed as “medium”(crimeDat[Alarm]=1) is way
more than those classiﬁed as “low”(crimeDat[Alarm]=0)
and “high”(crimeDat[Alarm]=2). Datasets with class imbalance are usually more complex to make accurate classiﬁcations
and often lead to the “Accuracy Paradox” [20].
D. Model
With the creation of the crimeDat dataset for classiﬁcation,
the next task is to use this dataset to make our classiﬁcations.

machine learning algorithm applied to our dataset. Also, let a
be a possible value for the crimeDat[Alarm].

If we keep algo and ti constant, we can afﬁrm that a is
dependent on d. Therefore, it is inferred that a (Alarm Rate)
→
−
at a given time point ti is dependent on d or the district in
question. Therefore, not all districts need the same amount of
police force for patrolling at a given time point. The next step
embodied the use machine learning algorithms to effectively
classify [21] a particular district according to its vulnerability
to crime at a particular time point. The scope of the work
discussed here, deal with machine learning algorithms such
as Gradient Boosting Tree(GBT) [22], Random Forest(RF)
[23], Decision Tree(DT) [24], K Nearest Neighbour(knn) [25],
Support Vector Machine(SVM) [26], Logistic Regression(LR)
[27] and Naive Bayes(NB) [28]. It was observed that tree
based algorithms gave signiﬁcant leverage over non-tree based
models owing to the imbalanced nature of the dataset.

V. E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS
The most important aspect of a machine learning problem is
evaluating a model’s performance. In accordance to the “No
Free Lunch” theorem [29], having to compare multiple ML
models over several parameters or evaluation metrics is an
inevitable process. In our supervised classiﬁcation problem,
the metrics used were accuracy, precision, recall f1 score and
unweighted average recall (UAR) to evaluate model performance [30].

In the modelling step, we ﬁrst mathematically derive a proof
for afﬁrming that “The degree of criminal presence at a given
time point (month, day and hour) is dependent on the district
or region in question”. The proof is as follows :

Let t be a time point vector as in (1). A vertical stack of

In (6), (7), (8), (9) and (10), the terms that have been used
have the meanings as follows :
• T P : True Positives (It refers to the number of positive
samples that have been correctly identiﬁed as positive)
• F P : False Positives (It refers to the number of negative
samples that have been incorrectly identiﬁed as positive)
• T N : True Negatives (It refers to the number of negative
samples that have been correctly identiﬁed as negative)
• F N : False Negatives (It refers to the number of positive
samples that have been incorrectly identiﬁed as negative)

Here, A is the “Alarm” vector or our target feature here and

districts in Chicago).

P recision : Describes the likeliness of a sample being
in class X if it has been predicted as belonging to class
X
Recall : Describes the likeliness of the model to correctly
classify a sample as belonging to class X if it actually
belongs to class X
F 1 : It is a measure that describes a relation between
P recision and Recall. Higher the F1 score for a class,
the better the model performs in classifying that particular
class.
U AR : Unweighted Average Recall (It is the average of
the individual recall values of each class that is to be
classiﬁed)
Ri : Recall value for ith class

The models have been trained on 75% of the crimeDat
dataset and then tested across 3 different samples of data.
• Sample 1 : 25% of crimeDat (With class imbalance)
• Sample 2 : 25% of crimeDat (Without class imbalance
- Achieved by oversampling)
• Sample 3 : All crime records from years 2012 to 2014

The results were achieved by using k=5 for KNN, “multinomial” logistic regression for LR, “linear” kernel for SVM,
gaussian NB and 1000 trees for both RF and GBT algorithms.
From Table II,it is evident that the best performing model
is different for all the 3 samples taken for testing. Apart
from the accuracies, Table II also highlights the F1 scores
and the UARs of each model. The averaging method for F1
scores across all the models is macroaveraging. This is done
so because macroaveraging provides a sense of the model’s
effectiveness on the minor classes in the dataset [31]. In this
case, the minor samples are those classiﬁed as “high alarm”
and it is more important that these high alarm regions are well
classiﬁed in order to maintain citizen safety. The GBT has the
highest accuracy in sample 1, while the random forest tree(RF)
tops sample 2. The KNN ranks highest in accuracy in sample
3. However, since our dataset is imbalanced, using accuracy
as the only metric to make a valid conclusion on model
performance is not conclusive. Therefore, the macroaveraged
F1 scores and UARs have been taken into consideration. The
highest F1 scores across sample 1, sample 2 and sample 3 are
obtained by GBT, RF and knn respectively, again. The higher
macroaveraged F1 scores indicates that the given model is able
to recognize the presence of minority classes in the dataset and
also classify them reasonably. Higher values of UARs indicates
the ability of a model to identify samples as belonging to their
particular classes. On comparison across the UAR metric, it is
observed that GBT, RF and GBT perform best across samples
1,2 and 3 respectively. Therefore, it can be afﬁrmed that the
top 3 models in this research are GBT, RF and knn. The
worst performance is obtained from Support Vector Machines
(SVM) as the UAR score for SVM is null. This is so because
the SVM model did not recognize the presence of the “high
alarm” minority class and did not make any such predictions.

This is a very dangerous situation as any model aimed at
answering the questions within the scope of this work should
be able to predict high crime regions in order to aid in keeping
citizens safe. A more dangerous situation that can arise is when
regions that have a high alarm rate (crimDat[Alarm] = 2) are
classiﬁed as regions with low crime rate (crimDat[Alarm]
= 0). Such a misclassiﬁcation would lead to much less
police force being deployed in a district that requires much
more force to curb the crime rate at a given time. Regions
with high crime rate (crimDat[Alarm] = 2) being classiﬁed
as moderately alarming regions (crimDat[Alarm] = 1) is
a comparatively less dangerous misclassiﬁcation. Therefore,
this research also tries to ﬁnd models that will reduce the
percentage of misclassiﬁcations of “high alarm” regions as
“low alarm” regions. Table III summarizes the percentages of
samples that are 2, but wrongly classiﬁed as 0. As observed,
GBT performs amazingly well across all 3 samples with very
low misclassiﬁcation percentages of 0.04%, 0.02% and 0%.
It is therefore necessary to use a computing model for our
deﬁned problem that is able to
• Achieve a high accuracy among all the 3 classes (low,
medium and high)
• Achieve a high macroaveraged F1 score to showcase
better precision-recall relation and thus achieve the ability
to identify all three classes without any bias.
• Obtain a low percentage of samples that are “high alarm”
regions , but wrongly classiﬁed as “low alarm” regions.
The GBT achieves all the above points with much more
effectiveness as compared to the other models used in this
work.
VI. C ONCLUSION
Prevention of criminal activity is among the top most
priorities of the world in the building of a well connected,
halcyon community where people are protected from all kinds
of mental and physical harm. This paper provides a means
of preventing crime by providing a possible solution to the
common problem of “lack of police force” in regions with
regular criminal activity. This paper provides a new outlook
in the way how crime related data has been explored in the
research world by proposing a way to judiciously use existing
police force to alleviate the impact of crime. The methodology
delineated in the paper gives an example of how the quantity of
police force needed at a particular district is directly dependent
on the instance of time as criminal unrest varies from district to
district with respect to a particular time point. The dataset used
in our research is a record of the crimes that have occurred in
Chicago. However, the presence of publicly available crime
data(of similar features) of the crimes in India could help
implement the solution proposed in the paper in the Indian
context. This would be of huge help to the Indian police system
as it would enable in the judicious usage of existing resources
to tackle crime, especially as India has a seemingly large
deﬁcit of police force to tackle the country’s crime related
issues. The use of machine learning techniques provides yet
another deep insight into the ﬁeld and offers yet another

Abstract— Privacy has become a prime importance in this
digital era. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) gets
collected in various firms such as educational institutions,
government organizations, hospitals etc.. The collected data is
often published and utilized for the purpose of analysis,
research, decision making, advertisement or for the purpose of
business. It is the duty of the data curator to store and to publish
the data safely. A person who is having accessibility to the data
that is published must not be able to identify or learn any new
personal or sensitive information of an individual. Statistical
Disclosure Control(SDC) is a suite of anonymization techniques.
The aim of SDC is post processing the data containing sensitive
or personal information and effectively protect the privacy of
the participating data subject. However these techniques leads
to “information loss “, i.e., any analysis or research carried on
such a data might not give a appropriate result. This paper aims
to discuss various metrics available to assess the information loss
in the processed data and an attempt has been made to propose
our technique for measuring the loss.
Keywords— Anonymization, Information Loss, Privacy
Preserving Data Publishing, Loss Metric, Identity Disclosure, PII,
Utility, SDC.

where color code modification & Boolean operation is applied
to the binary mask of each pixel of the leaf image[7]. He
suggested the technique for identifying plant leaf illness in
which H histograms and color channels are altered [8-9] Pang
et al suggested the technique for computerized assessment of
crop leaf disease pictures by incorporating local limit and
increasing seed area [10]. Distinct intelligent systems have
been developed to diagnose corn plant for computerized
identification of corn diseases [11-12]. While high
competence is achieved by the deep learning tactics, it
generally generates a model of big size. In addition, studies
involving traditional machine learning methods are generally
complicated or based on outdated feature extraction [13-16],
and costly camera photography is required[17].

Abstract—In the agricultural sector, identification of plant
diseases is extremely crucial as they hamper robustness and
health of the plant which play a vital role in agricultural
productivity. These problems are common in plants, if proper
prevention methods are not taken it might seriously affect the
cultivation. The current method of detecting disease is done by
an expert's opinion and physical analysis, which is timeconsuming and costly in the real world. Hence, computer-based
detection has become a necessity. This paper comprises of an
overview of image segmentation using K-means clustering and
HSV dependent classification for recognizing infected part of
the leaf and feature extraction using GLCM. The efficiency of
the proposed methodology is able to detect and classify the plant
diseases successfully with an accuracy of 98% when processed
by Random Forest classifier.

The above experimental studies shows that there are
various automated processes available to identify plant
diseases using classifiers like SVM and Naive Bayes, but the
proposed approach uses HSV value alteration technique for
fully automated image segmentation process and Random
Forest for Image classification which is less cumbersome,
easy to apply and has enhanced the accuracy.

I. INTRODUCTION
Agriculture is the backbone of the economy in various
countries. The agricultural productivity is dependent on
various factors. Advancement in agricultural sector is two to
four times more effective in raising the revenue among the
poorest people compared to any other sectors. If proper
identification and prevention methods are not followed in
early stage of cultivation, it can lead to crop failure and
downfall of the economy in any country. For accurate advice
on plant diseases, finding farm specialists in rural areas is a
very difficult task[1]. This needs continuous monitoring of
specialists, however, which in big farms could be exorbitantly
costly and time consuming [2]. Due to these challenges faced
by farmers, Image processing techniques can provide insights
into recognition and treatment of plant disease at early stages
before spreading [3]. In most cases disease symptoms are seen
on the leaves, fruit and stem. the leaf is considered for plant
disease detection. This paper throws light on various
techniques used for image segmentation and classification of
plant diseases.

PROPOSED METHOD

The proposed methodology contains five major steps that
are represented in Fig-1

Fig. 1. Proposed methodolgy for plant disease detection

A. Image aquisition
Pictures of different leaves are photographed using a
camera or comparative gadgets. Leaves affected with diseases
such as Bacterial Spot, Early Blight, Late blight are used in
the dataset. Size and resolution of the images play a crucial
role in the efficiency of the proposed methodology.

LITERATURE REVIEW

In [2], The approach developed over image processing is
quick and efficient for grading of plant diseases. Otsu method
was used for segmentation of leaf image [4-6]. The disease
spot area is then segmented by the Sobel operator for edge
detection. In final step, infected area is recognized by
calculating the quotient of diseased spot. K-mean is then used
to cluster grape leaf diseases and through next step infected
part is identified using Neural Networks, the diseased part is
recognized.

B. Image Processing
The required image was obtained by transforming the
original image (i.e. the image size has been converted to
256X256 pixels). Unwanted noise from the image is removed.
The BGR format is converted to gray scale as well as HSV

format for applying the proposed method. Smoothening of
image is also done using smoothing filter.
C. Image Segmentation
The segmentation of images is the method of splitting a
picture into several components or sections. The foreground is
isolated from the background or densely packed areas of
pixels, depending on color or shape similarities. In the
proposed method image segmentation is done using either KMean clustering or using HSV value Alteration. Both of these
approaches lead to equivalent results.
1) K-Means: The K-means clustering algorithm
performs segmentation by minimizing the sum of squares of
distances between the image intensities and the cluster
centroids. In the present work, K-means clustering is used for
segmenting an image into diseased part and healthy part.
Initially each pixel is considered as a cluster, then the distance
between two nearby clusters are minimized by combining
them [18-19]. This process is repeated unless different color
K number of clusters are formed, this helps to differentiate
diseased part of the leaf.

2) Hue Saturation Value Alteration: When BGR image
is converted to HSV format it contains 3 elements known as
H-Hue corresponds to the value component (Base pigment)
hence just by selecting a range of Hue, any color can be
selected.(0 to 360), S-Saturation is the amount of color (depth
of pigment) ranges from 0-100% and V- value is basically the
brightness of color (0-100%). Fig-2 explains the
representation of HSV format. The RBG format can be
converted to HSV using (1-7). All the leaves have colors in
green range hence HSV upper value and lower value
identification is done only once as depicted in Fig-3(a). Lower
boundaries of HSV are 0,61,68 respectively and upper
boundaries are 30,255,255 respectively. Using these values
defected part of any leaf Fig-3(c) is extracted. The pixels have
HSV values in the declared range are masked and converted
into Black and White format Fig-3(d).

2) Decision Tree: Decision Tree is a major technique
used in data mining to classify large amounts of data and
extract data with similar patterns. Dataset is broken down into
smaller subsets addition to that decision tree is developed
resulting in a final result consisting of decision tree and leaf
nodes. Classification of large number of data and extracting
features having similar patterns using decision tree yields
extraordinary results

D. Feature extraction
Extracting characteristics of an image is known as feature
extraction. Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) is
used for extracting the feature set. GLCM is the statistical
method of exploring texture, which considers the spatial
bonding of pixels [20]. Each pixel map produces a cooccurrence matrix for the infected portion of the picture.
During creation of GLCMs, a set of offsets describing pixel
relations of different direction and distance is specified. Five
characteristics include contrast, dissimilarity, homogeneity,
second moment angularity, energy and correlation are
extracted in the suggested technique. Let

3) K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN): Similar and dissimilar
data are classified to more than one class using KNN
classification technique. N dimensional numeric attributes
are used to depict the train set. A point in N dimensional space
represents respective values in the dataset [21]. A KNN
classifier classifies the dataset by looking at the pattern in
training set that are closest to the unknown samples. How
close these samples are defined by Euclidean distance. By
making use of the features that were inherited in the feature
extraction step, the image is classified into a specific class.

total number of distinct gray levels in the quantized image.
GLCM features like Energy, Contrast Features, Dissimilarity,
Homogeneity, ASM are extracted using (8-12)

4) Support Vector Machine (SVM): Support vector
machine algorithm finds a hyperplane that distinctly
classifies the data points. The hyperplane is an N-dimensional
space (the number of features -N) which helps to classify the
values. There are various methods to find a hyperplane in
order to separate two data points but we need to find an
optimal hyperplane which has a maximum margin (there
should be a maximum distance between two points of both
the classes). Maximizing the distance(margin) provides
reinforcement so that dataset can be classified with more
confidence percentage. SVM can be used to transform
features into much higher dimensions.

E. Classification
After feature extraction the next step is using the data and
classifying different types of diseases. Classification is the
process of grouping data based on similarities. Here
classification is used to classify the diseases that the leaves
are having. Machine learns how to identify the proper name
of a diseased leaf. Various types of models are available but
in this proposed methodology either of the following models
can be used and respective outcome can be achieved.

RESULTS

The dataset consists of different leaves having different
diseases like pepper bell and tomato with bacterial spot,
potato and tomato with early blight and late blight. It also
contains normal images of these leaves. Fig-4 shows the
original images of leaves followed by the segmented images
and black and white formatted images. The segmented
images are used for feature extraction. Five features are
extracted using GLCM and are stored in dataset. Total 8000
images were used for training the model and the testing set
contains overall of 100 images wherein 25 healthy images of
leaf and 25 images of each disease (Early Blight, Late Blight
and Bacterial spot) is present. The classification's efficiency
is evaluated by comparing the predicted type and original
type. In the proposed methodology, for classification
purposes the dataset was tested with Random Forest,
Decision Tree, KNN and SVM classifiers. Random Forest
proved to be yielding maximum accuracy of 98%. Table-2
represents the confusion matrix of random forest. Only One
of the leaves infected with bacterial spot was identified as
Late Blight and one of the leaves infected with Late Blight
was identified as Early Blight. Fig-6 represents the accuracy
of Random forest on all diseases. Other reliable approaches
are Decision Tree , KNN and SVM which yields acceptable
accuracies of 94%, 92%, 90% respectively. which are
reflected in Table-3,4,5 respectively in the form of confusion
matrix. Table-1 and Fig-5 reflects the result of all the

1) Random Forest: Random Forest is one of the efficient
machine learning classification method. Large number of
datasets can be classified using this technique. Random forest
is a group of decision trees, Where N training samples are
selected randomly and each tree is trained using these N
samples with replacement.
Random Forest pseudocode:
1. “K” features from “m” are selected randomly.
(k<<m)
2. Using the best split point node “d” is calculated
among the given “K” features
3. Using the best split, the daughter nodes are splitted.
4. Unless “I” number of nodes are reached repeat 1 to
3 steps
5. To create “n” number of trees, steps 1 to 4 are
repeated.

proposed approaches with respective accuracies. According
to the results it is proved that Random Forest classifier has
enhanced the plant disease detection process as compared to
approaches used in [22].

CONCLUSION

This paper presents different methodologies of
automated computerized disease detection in plants, which
can be done using image segmentation and classification
methods. The algorithms were tested on three diseases
namely Early Blight, Late Blight and Bacterial Spot.
Recognition of the diseases is the main purpose of the
proposed approach. HSV alteration method proved to be
very efficient for identifying the diseased part from the leaf,
adding to which GLCM also improved the accuracy by
extracting texture features. Hence by evaluating the results,
the proposed approach yields accurate detection of plant
leaf diseases with minimum computational complexity.

An brief summary of the various evaluation metrics present
in the HPCC Systems Production ML Bundles, organized
bundle-wise, is presented in Table I.

The design of the metrics implemented, that help users
monitor models more closely, are presented here. They include intrinsic and extrinsic measures of the performance of
clustering models, tests that aid in feature selection, and a few
popular benchmarks that are commonly found in literature.
A. Balanced F-Score
The F-Score, is a statistical measure of a tests accuracy.
It is calculated as the weighted harmonic mean of the tests
precision and recall. When both the precision and the recall
are assigned equal weights, this score is called the balanced Fscore. An F-Score of 1 indicates perfect precision and recall.
An F-Score of 0 indicates the worst possible precision and
recall. The F score can provide a more realistic measure of a
tests performance by using both precision and recall.
1) Proposed Implementation: Since both the precision and
recall per class are readily available by the use of the AccuracyByClass measure present in the ML Core bundle, the Balanced F-Score may be directly implemented into this function

in Algorithm 1.

Silhouette analysis is a way to measure a points closeness
to its own cluster as well as its separation from other clusters
[1]. It provides an easy way to ﬁnd the optimum value for k
during k-means clustering [2].
Silhouette values lie in the range of (-1, 1). A value of +1
indicates that the sample point is far away from its neighboring
cluster and very close to the cluster it is assigned. Similarly, a
value of -1 indicates that the point is closer to its neighboring
cluster than to the cluster it is assigned.
1) Computation: The Silhouette score for each individual
sample is calculated as follows. If a is the average of the
distances of the sample from all other samples in its assigned
cluster, and b is the average of the distances of the sample
from all points assigned to the closest cluster to the sample,
not assigned to it (Here, the closest cluster is the one that
essentially produces the smallest b value). Once these values
are computed, the coefﬁcient is given by (1)
Si =

B. Hamming Loss
Hamming loss is a simple measure that is used to conveniently evaluate multi-label classiﬁcation models. It is given
by the fraction of labels that are incorrectly classiﬁed, among
all the labels.
a) Proposed implementation: Since the error count is
readily available in the Accuracy measure present in the
ML Core bundle, the Hamming Loss can be obtained as

bi − ai
max(bi , ai )

(1)

2) Proposed implementation: The proposed implementation takes as input the labels produced by the clustering
algorithm and the positions (co-ordinates / features) of the
samples. It returns the average silhouette coefﬁcient of all the
samples present per cluster, per work item. The implementation involves the creation of two variations. The ﬁrst variation
produces the silhouette score for each individual point, and the

218

2019 4th International Conference on Computational Systems and Information Technology for Sustainable Solution (CSITSS)

second variation gives the average of these scores to produce
one score for all the points. The algorithm to produce the
Silhouette score per point is detailed in Algorithm 3.
Algorithm 3 Algorithm to produce Silhouette score for each
point
Input: labels : labels assigned to the points
Input: points : co-ordinates / features of the points
Output: Silhouette score per point, per work-item.

that belong to the same cluster}

that belong to the different clusters}

D. Chi Squared Feature Selection Test
The Chi squared test is a statistical hypothesis test where
the sampling distribution assumes the form of a χ2 distribution
when the null hypothesis assumed is correct [3]. In the context
of feature selection, it may be used to establish the degree of
dependence of two categorical variables by analysing the null
hypothesis that they are independent of each other. Hence, it
can be used to determine whether a classiﬁer is dependent on a
certain feature. This test can only be used when both variables
are categorical.
1) Contingency Table: The contingency table represents the
number of samples present in the data for each combination
of sample category and feature category. To start with the chi2
test, a contingency table of the data is ﬁrst constructed.
2) Chi square value and Null hypothesis testing: In the
Chi squared test, we ﬁrst assume the null hypothesis that the
two variables are independent. We then proceed to construct
a contingency table that supports this claim, based off of the
sums of rows and columns of our existing contingency table
[4]. We then calculate the chi square value from (2)
 (ei − oi )2
χ2 =
(2)
ei
i
For a large population, the probability distribution of this value
for a random sampling (small subset) of the population is
known to approximately follow a χ2 distribution, and hence
the name of the coefﬁcient. A large value of χ2 indicates that
it is less probable that the sample is not an outlier and is a
good representation of the population.

Hence, when the null hypothesis that the sample is independent of a feature produces a large χ2 value, it indicates
that there is a low probability that the null hypothesis is true
and hence null hypothesis is rejected and the dependence of
the two variables is established. A lower χ2 value indicates
that it is more probable that the null hypothesis is true. It
is not known for certain, however the null hypothesis cannot
be rejected and the dependence of the variables cannot be
established.
3) Proposed implementation: The implementation consists
of two separate functionalities. The ﬁrst part creates a contingency table of the data, and the second ﬁnds the chi2 values.
a) Contingency table: The contingency table function
takes two different DiscreteField datasets and returns a contingency table for each combination of feature and classiﬁer,
per work item. Though a contingency table can be formed
between any two categorical variables, the function names its
parameters features and samples for convenience.
Algorithm 4 Algorithm to produce contingency table
Input: features : Independent data
Input: samples : Dependent data
Output: Contingency table per combination of classiﬁer and
feature, per work-item
1: comb ← JOIN samples, f eatures
2: grouped ← GROUP comb by samples, features
3: contingency ← COUNT grouped per group
4: return contingency
b) Chi Squared Test: The chi squared feature test implementation takes the independent (features) and dependent
(samples) data as parameters, and returns the chi squared
coefﬁcient value and the number of degrees of freedom for
each combination of classiﬁer and feature.
Equation (2) is used to calculate the chi square coefﬁcient
value from the expected and actual values, in Line 16 of
Algorithm 5.
Equation (3) is used to compute the entries of the expected
contingency table mentioned at Line 9 of Algorithm 5.

E. Adjusted Rand Index
The rand index in data clustering is a statistical measure of
similarity between two data clustering result [5] [6]. The rand
index however, does not necessarily produce a lower score
for a random labelling of data. The Adjusted Rand Index is
the corrected-for-chance version of the rand index, that uses
the expected rand index value to correct the score. Adjusted
Rand Index can assume values between -1 and 1. A value of

1 indicates perfectly matching clustering results, and a lower
value indicates mismatched clustering results.
As an evaluation metric, the Adjusted Rand Index may be
used to compare the values produced by a clustering algorithm
to the actual values (ground truth), making ARI an extrinsic
evaluation method.
1) Computation: The Adjusted Rand Index is calculated
from the contingency table of the data as shown in (5), where
nij is the element on the ith row and j th column, ai is the
sum of the ith row, bj is the sum of the j th column, and n is
the number of samples.

2) Proposed Implementation: The implementation takes as
parameters the two different labelling / clustering results, and
returns the Adjusted Rand Score per work-item. It involves
ﬁnding the required sums from the contingency table of the
data and combining them to form the ARI as per (5). The
algorithm to ﬁnd the ARI from the contingency table of the
data is detailed in Algorithm 6.
F. Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve
The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve is a
graphical plot that indicates the ability of a binary classiﬁer
to differentiate between two classes [7]. The curve is created
by plotting the True Positive Rate (TPR) vs the False Positive
Rate (FPR) of the classiﬁer its threshold is varied from 0 to 1.
(When a classiﬁer produces scores indicating the probability
that a sample belongs to a particular class, the probability

threshold is the probability above which a sample must be
scored so that the sample is classiﬁed as positive.)
The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a measure of
the classiﬁer’s ability to distinguish between classes. When
using normalized units, this area is also numerically equal to
the probability that a random positive sample is scored higher
than a random negative sample [8].
The AUC is an evaluation measure for binomial classiﬁcation. It can, however, be extended to evaluate multi-class
classiﬁers, by evaluating them in a one vs. all fashion or a
one vs. one fashion.
1) Proposed Implementation: The implementation takes as
parameters the actual labels of the dependent data and the
predicted scores (per point, per class) produced by the classiﬁer. The implementation supports multi-class classiﬁcation
by arranging the classes in a one vs. all fashion. The AUC is
obtained as the probability that a random positive sample is
scored higher than a random negative sample. The algorithm
to obtain the AUC from the data provided is detailed in
Algorithm 7.
IV. T ESTING
To test the evaluation metrics implemented, the results of
these functions were compared with the results produced by
their corresponding implementations in the popular python
machine learning library, Scikit-Learn [9]. The tests include
various criteria such as multiple work-item, multiple classiﬁers, etc. To conduct the tests, randomised data was generated
and fed to both implementations1 . Testing indicates that the
results produced by this implementation matches those produced by sklearn to a high degree of precision. The results of
these tests are presented here.

B. Adjusted Rand Index
The test produces two sets of 1000 random labelling per
work-item, for 10 work-items. These two sets of labels are
used as input for ARI. Test results are presented in Table III.
It is seen that the ARI values are close to 0, as is characteristic
of ARI for random labelling.
C. Area Under ROC Curve
The test produces 1000 samples with 3 different classiﬁers
and 4 different classes, per work-item for 2 work-items. Test
results are displayed in Table IV. It is seen that the AUC values
are close to 0.5, as expected of a random classiﬁcation.
D. Chi squared feature test
The test produces a dependent (classiﬁer) variable set of
1000 samples with 3 classiﬁers and 4 classes per work-item,
for 2 work-items, and a similar independent (feature) variable

used as input to the chi squared feature test. Test results are
presented in Table V.
V. V ISUALISATIONS
To demonstrate the use of these evaluation metrics, a few
data visualisations performed on the results of analysis of real
world datasets are presented.
A. Silhouette score
The Silhouette score can be used to ﬁnd the inherent quality
of the clustering results without the use of ground truth values.
Hence, the score can be used to ﬁnd the optimal value of K
in K-Means clustering by selecting the model which has the
highest average silhouette score. Fig. 1 shows the silhouette
score of the clustering result as the K value changes from K=2
to K=5.

Abstract— HPCC Systems is an open source big data
processing platform used to provide big data solutions. Big
data processing applications such as image processing, audio
processing often make use of mathematical computations,
however currently there is little provision for execution of
extensive mathematical computations on HPCC systems
platform. Gnu Octave is an opensource programming
language for numerical computations, to enable HPCC
Systems to use the power of Octave this paper proposes design
and implementation of an Octave plugin. Octave plugin gives
HPCC Systems a new dimension for its mathematical
computation ability, especially the simplicity of Octave
enhances its numerical computation power. The Octave
plugin is implemented and tested by executing an use case of
fuzzy inference system for traffic control. The results
demonstrate the successful integration of Octave plugin with
HPCC Systems.

Abstract—Deep neural networks are finding their way into most
of the fields in today’s world. One such field is predicting the
click through rate for online advertising. Multiple deep neural
network based models for click through rate prediction have
been proposed in the last few years. Model assessment is crucial
in solving any real world problem. With this paper, we shed
some light on the recent deep learning models which have been
outperforming traditional models lately. Two benchmark
datasets were used: namely Criteo and Avazu dataset.
Comprehensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate the
superiority of some of the models over others. Most studies
include pre-setting the hyper parameters for optimum
performance. In this study, the models learn the hyper
parameters to further improve the results and maximize the
predictive accuracy. Key findings include how inclusion of
feature dependency in the model can be beneficial when data
present has higher number of features. Factors influencing
model selection such as no pre-training or feature engineering
required might not be the best options when aiming for
performance. Finally, this study concludes how hyper
parameters affect chosen deep model’s performance.

Abstract—As Internet technology has become a part of the
lifestyle of the common man, research efforts are extensively
made in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
Information Retrieval. Studying regional languages for
developing the system to store, retrieve, extract the
information from the database has gained lots of prominence
nowadays. Case studies show that Ontological Information
Retrieval has many advantages over keyword-based approach.
In this paper we have focused on the general architecture of
ontology-based Information Retrieval used for Kannada.

Abstract— Classification and in-depth analysis of these
various forms of distraction can allow for intelligent alert
systems. Before creating an artificial intelligence system, it is
imperative to understand the various parameters that are
interplaying in the current environment. Based on how these
factors influence the behavior of a driver, the corrective
measures should be suggested to the driver. (At later stages,
such changes may be incorporated into the vehicle itself.)
