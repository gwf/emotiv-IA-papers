Abstract: The aim of this paper is to develop a brain–computer interface (BCI) system that can control a robotic
arm using EEG signals generated by facial expressions. The EEG signals are acquired using a neurosignal acquisition
headset. The robotic arm consists of a 3-D printed prosthetic hand that is attached to a forearm and elbow made of
craft wood. The arm is designed to make four moves. Each move is controlled by one facial expression. Hence, four
diﬀerent EEG signals are used in this work. The performance of the BCI robotic arm is evaluated by testing it on 10
subjects. Initially 14 electrodes were used to collect the EEG signals, and the accuracy of the system is around 95%. We
have further analyzed the minimum requirement for the number of electrodes for the system to function properly. Seven
(instead of 14) electrodes in the parietal, temporal, and frontal regions are suﬃcient for the system to function properly.
The accuracy of the system with 7 electrodes is around 95%.
Key words: Brain–computer interface, electroenchephalograpy signal, facial expressions, robotic arm

1. Introduction
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a noninvasive method to record the electrical activity of the brain. EEG is
widely used in the diagnosis of neurological disorders [1] and development of brain–computer interfaces (BCIs)
[2–5]. BCIs translate the EEG signal into useful commands that can control output devices [6]. One of the
many uses of BCIs is to enable disabled people to perform their daily activities without being dependent on
other individuals. Diﬀerent components of a BCI system are shown in Figure 1.
An EEG signal can be decomposed into four frequency components, namely beta, alpha, theta, and delta
waves [7,8]. Beta waves have relatively low amplitude and their frequency ranges from 12.5 to 30 Hz. These
waves appear when people are engaged in conversation. Alpha waves are slower than beta waves but have higher
amplitude than beta waves. The frequency of alpha waves ranges from 7.5 to 12.5 Hz. These waves occur when
people are listening to music, watching TV, or meditating. The frequency of theta waves ranges from 4 to 7.5
Hz. This state represents the presleep or semiawake state also known as the hypnoidal state. Delta waves have
the highest amplitude and the slowest frequency, ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 Hz. This brainwave is associated with
dreamless sleep. It is important for restoration of health and of the immune system. There are two more types
of brainwaves, known as gamma and mu waves. The frequency of gamma waves range from 25 to 100 Hz. It
represents an excited mental state and is advantageous for learning. Mu waves have the same frequency as alpha
waves (7.5 to 12.5 Hz), but, unlike alpha waves, these are found at the sensori motor cortex. They represent
the resting state of motor neurons. These waves play an important role in the function of the human brain.

One of the most interesting parts of BCI development is that these devices can be controlled by human
thoughts. It may be very useful for people who lose the ability to use their muscles because of total or partial
paralysis of their entire motor system due to stroke, traumatic brain injury, or cerebral palsy. These patients
are fully conscious and alert, but are unable to use their muscles. Hence they can use the power of their brains
along with the required interface and output devices to perform an action, e.g., wheel chair control or prosthetic
arm control. In order to control a device using thoughts, some training is needed. For example, the subject
may visualize closing his or her hand. The signals of this thought (hand-closing) will be collected; features will
be extracted and then programmed into the BCI system. Later, when the subject thinks of closing his or her
hand, the robotic hand will close automatically [5].
2. Overview
This section will give a brief overview of the hardware devices and software needed to design and develop a
BCI-based system to control a prosthetic/robotic arm.
2.1. Data acquisition
The EEG signal is acquired from the brain using a wireless Emotiv EPOC headset [9,10] that receives EEG
signals via electrodes placed on the human scalp (San Francisco, CA, USA). The Emotiv EPOC headset has
14 electrodes plus 2 reference electrodes that are located at positions AF3, AF4, F3, F4, F7, F8, FC5, FC6,
P7, P8, T7, T8, O1, and O2 based on the international 10–20 system [11,12] of electrode placement. Here AF
stands for anterior frontal, F stands for frontal, FC stands for fronto-central, P stands for parietal, and O stands
for occipital. Two reference electrodes (CMS/DRL) are placed on P3/P4 as shown in Figure 2. The EEG data
are acquired at a sampling rate of 128 Hz.
The Emotiv software development kit is provided by the Emotiv systems. This software package contains
Emotiv Control Panel, EmoComposer, Emokey, and TestBench. The Emotiv Control Panel displays the
mapping of the headset setup and the signal strength of each channel. It has three built-in suites: Expressiv
Suite, Aﬀectiv Suite, and Cognitiv Suite. The Expressiv Suite can detect facial expressions based on the user’s

EEG signals. It uses an animated face to display the user’s current expression. It can recognize 12 types of
expressions and allows users to adjust the sensitivity of the signals. The interface of Expressiv Suite is shown in
Figure 3. The Aﬀectiv Suite reads the user’s emotional state and the Cognitiv Suite reads conscious thoughts
for movements and activity.

Figure 3. Interface of the Expressiv Suite.

2.1.1. EmoKey
The EmoKey is a program that allows the user to define keystrokes for sampled EEG signals. This program is
connected to either Emotiv Control Panel or EmoComposer. An EPOC user can generate a keystroke(s) for a
specific signal(s). Hence it is possible to use EmoKey to navigate and operate a device using these keystrokes.
709

NISAR et al./Turk J Elec Eng & Comp Sci

After defining the keystroke, the user can save the key mapping for future use.
2.1.2. TestBench
The TestBench displays a graph of real-time raw EEG signals. The raw EEG signals can be recorded and saved
for future playback by using the TestBench. This program also allows the user to observe the magnitude of fast
Fourier transform and delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands.
2.2. Output devices
2.2.1. Arduino UNO
The Arduino UNO 2015a [13] is an electronic board with a built-in microcontroller that is based on the
ATmega328. It is a tool for making devices that can be easily designed and programmed by the users, as
shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4. Arduino UNO.

2.2.2. InMoov Robot
Gaël Langevin is a French sculptor and model maker who had no real robotic engineering experience. He
started a personal project to create a life-size humanoid robot called InMoov in January 2012 [14]. The InMoov
robot shown in Figure 5 was designed with open source 3D software and can be printed using any 12 ×
12 × 12 cm 3D printer. Those 3D part files (.stl) are open source and they are downloadable from Gaël’s
website (InMoov.blogspot.com). Gaël came up with the idea to incorporate servos and an Arduino to yield a
programmable robotic hand. The hand can be controlled by using a keyboard and is able to move at many
speeds. In 8 months, Gaël’s project went from a simple hand to a torso, arms, and head. This robot has a
moving capability just like a human being. The fingers are able to move, the hand is able to twist, and the
elbow is able to flex and extend [15].
2.2.3. Robotic arm
In this paper, the hand part of the robotic arm is printed by a 3D printer based on the design of the InMoov
robot. After printing and assembly, the forearm and elbow parts are built using craft wood. Five servo motors
(TowerPro SG90, Taiwan) are attached to the forearm wooden board and bound to each finger of the printed

hand part with fishing string. After that, the forearm and elbow are connected by a metal gear servo motor
(RDS 3115). Lastly, the 6V battery holder and the Arduino board are attached to the elbow part. Figure 6

3. Methodology
3.1. Design of the BCI system
The main objective of this research is to design a simple BCI-based robotic arm that is able to make four moves
(flex and extend the elbow, make and release a fist) using EEG signals. To realize this project, a device that
collects EEG signals as the input and converts the signals into mechanical output is necessary. The designed
system consists of five steps, as shown in Figure 7. The first step is to acquire the brain signal for a specific
thought/activity from a user by using the EPOC headset and Emotiv software. The robotic arm is designed to
have four moves and so four diﬀerent EEG signals generated using four diﬀerent facial expressions are used in
this work. The system is designed using the Expressiv suite provided by the Emotiv software. Since the EEG
signals from diﬀerent users may be diﬀerent, it is necessary to create a profile for every subject/user.

3.2. Signal processing and EEG feature extraction
For this project, Expressiv Suite is chosen to control the robotic arm. In order to enable the robotic arm to
perform four motions, four EEG signals are required using diﬀerent facial expressions, as shown in Table 1. For
every user, a profile is maintained so that the EEG signals are sampled and trained. To sample these signals,
click on the “Training” button on the right-hand side of the software interface, select the expression to train,
then click on “Start Training” and make the expression for 8 s. After that, click on the “Sensitivity” bar and
adjust the sensitivity of the signals until the accuracy is better. Save and update the user profile after training
and sensitivity adjustments.
The Emokey allows the user to define keystrokes for each EEG signal. These keystrokes will be sent as
input to the Arduino microcontroller. The keystrokes are assigned for every expression and related movements,
as shown in Table 1. In order to send commands from a personal computer to an Arduino microcontroller, an
interface program is developed in MATLAB. The Arduino microcontroller will be programmed so that it can
make the robotic arm move as described by the keystrokes from the computer. The flow chart of the complete
system is shown in Figure 8.

3.3. Interface program
The keystroke information stores the EEG signature of the specific movements; this information is transferred
to the robotic arm to perform a motion. This is done via an interface developed in MATLAB. An application
with at least four buttons (for four types of arm response) is created and each button is assigned a specific
hot-key. The hot-keys are defined by EmoKey. The flow of the interactive program to send the keystrokes
from the computer to the Arduino microcontroller is shown in Figure 9. This interface sends input from the
computer to the microcontroller of the robotic arm.
3.4. Arduino microcontroller
The robotic arm is driven by several servo motors that are controlled by the Arduino UNO R3 electronic board.
The responses of the servo motors are listed in Table 1. This microcontroller is programmed so that it can read
input from the computer and give output to all motors as shown in Figure 9.
3.5. Experimental procedure
3.5.1. Experiment 1: analysis of the performance of the system
The BCI system is tested on ten subjects to evaluate the sensitivity and accuracy of the system. Due to the
malfunction of one of the electrodes (AF3) of the EPOC headset, all the subjects were tested with thirteen
electrodes only. Thus, the term “full set of electrodes” refers to thirteen electrodes instead of fourteen. The
flow of the experiment is as follows:
• Wear the Emotive EPOC headset.
• Create a user profile for each subject using the Emotiv control panel.
• Select Expressiv Suite from the control panel and train the subject. “Neutral” signal, followed by “Raise
Brow,” “Left Smirk,” “Right Smirk,” and “Look Left or Right.” The subjects were advised to remain
calm during the whole process.
• The subjects control the robotic arm and repeat each motion ten times.
• The data are recorded and analyzed.
3.5.2. Reduction of electrodes
The above experiment is performed using the full set of electrodes in the headset. The EEG data used to
control the robotic arm are obtained from facial expressions. The control of the robotic arm involves the motor
region of the brain and therefore we tried to decrease the number of electrodes used for the system based on
the hypothesis that electrodes in the frontal and motor region will be more important [16].

Figure 8. Flowchart of the BCI system.

We performed an analysis to find the minimum number of electrodes that are required by this BCI system
without any degradation in the performance. The electrodes were removed one by one and the accuracy of the
system was evaluated. With each electrode removed, the system was tested ten times for each move and the
data were recorded to determine the accuracy. If the accuracy of the system is above 85%, we can assume
that the electrode can be safely removed as it may not be essential for the proper functioning of the system.
However, if the accuracy falls below 85%, then that electrode is considered important for the system. Later,

the removed electrode was put back and another electrode was removed for testing purposes. This step was
repeated until all electrodes had been tested.
3.5.3. Experiment 2: performance of the system with reduced electrodes
In order to test the accuracy of the system, the same test as in experiment 1 was performed in the same subjects
with the reduced number of electrodes.
4. Results and discussion
The BCI-based robotic arm is tested on ten subjects. Each subject is tested ten times for each action; as there
are four actions, the total number of trials for each subject is forty. In order to determine the accuracy of the
system, first we need to define some metrics to measure the performance of the system [5]. These metrics are
true positive (TP), false negative (FN), true negative (TN), and false positive (FP). The definitions of these
performance metrics are given in Table 2.
The term “correct input” means the correct expression that is required to make the robotic arm to
perform the desired move. To find out the value of TP or FN of an action, we need to refer to the result when
the subject is doing a correct expression ten times. On the other hand, to find out the value of TN and FP
of an action, we refer to the results generated by the other three actions, which result from the rest of the
thirty trials. After the outcomes are defined, we can determine the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the
system. The sensitivity is also known as TP rate; it refers to the measure of positives that are correctly defined.

The specificity, also known as TN rate, refers to the measure of the proportion of negatives that are correctly
defined. Lastly, the accuracy defines the overall performance of the BCI system. The formulae of sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy are given in Eqs. (1) to (3).

Table 3 shows the performance of Subject 1. Table 4 and Figure 10 show a graph of the performance of all
subjects. The minimum accuracy achieved is 0.85 for Elbow Extension by subject 10. There are some possible
factors that may aﬀect the accuracy, for example the emotion of the subject. Some subjects feel nervous when
they cannot move the arm correctly and some subjects feel irritated because each experiment takes more than
30 min. However, when we look at the average accuracy in Figure 11, we can observe that all average accuracies
are above 0.92 and the average overall accuracy of ten subjects is 0.95. Hence, we may conclude that the
performance of the BCI-based robotic arm is good.

4.1. Determining the minimum number of electrodes required
In the previous experiment, ten subjects were tested to control the robotic arm. After the experimental results
were found satisfactory, we proceeded to determine the minimum number of electrodes that are required for
the system to work eﬃciently. One electrode is removed at a time from the EPOC and the performance of the
system is observed. This step is repeated until all electrodes are tested. The results of the electrode removal are
shown in Figure 12. When the accuracy of the BCI system falls below 85% by the removal of an electrode, that
electrode is labeled an important electrode. However, if the accuracy of the system remains above 85%, even

after the removal of an electrode, then that electrode is not considered important and can be safely removed
from the system. Hence, six electrodes are considered safe to remove; these are F3, FC5, F4, FC6, O2, and O1.
The remaining 8 electrodes are considered important for the proper functioning of the system; these are P7,
P8, T7, T8, F7, F8, AF4, and AF3, located in the parietal, frontal, and temporal regions. Figure 13 gives a

Finally, the performance of the BCI system is tested with 7 electrodes on the same subjects following the same
experimental procedure. The accuracy of the system is given in Table 5 and Figure 14. We can observe that
the lowest accuracy achieved is 83.3%. The average accuracies are above 90%, while overall average accuracy
is 95%, as shown in Figure 15. Figure 16 compares the results of Experiment 1 and Experiment 2; the average
diﬀerence is only 0.316% and so the performance of the system using seven electrodes is considered satisfactory.

In this experiment, instead of using facial expressions to control the BCI system, we have used the power
of the human mind to control the robot [17]. Hence, the robotic arm is controlled using the thought process.
The Cognitiv Suite of the Emotiv control panel can be used to acquire the user’s conscious thoughts and intents
to control the robot. The cognitive suite provides a graphical user interface for training. In this project, we
have used Push and Pull cognitive states for training the cognitive activity to make and release a fist. This
method was tested on two subjects with two moves only, but could not achieve very good results. The average
accuracy achieved was around 50%. One of the reasons for the poor performance was that the subjects chosen
found it diﬃcult to use the thought process. Hence we may conclude that some subjects may need longer time
to train themselves.

5. Conclusion and recommendations
In this paper, a BCI-based robotic arm that can be controlled by EEG signals generated from facial expressions
is designed and developed successfully. An Emotiv EPOC headset was used to collect the EEG signals generated
by facial expressions using the built-in Expressiv suite for feature extraction. The proposed robotic arm is able
to make four moves (make and release a fist, extend and flex the elbow) using EEG signals resulting from left
smirk, right smirk, raise brow, and look left or right. The EEG signals were trained using Expressiv Suite,
which is provided by Emotiv software.
The robotic arm consists of three parts: hand, forearm, and elbow. The hand part has many joints. It
was printed using a 3D printer and based on the hand design from the InMoov project. In order to reduce the
cost of this project, the forearm and elbow part were built using wooden board. Six servo motors were attached
on the forearm part to make the robotic arm move, while the power supply and Arduino board were attached
to the elbow part.
The complete system was tested on ten subjects to determine its performance. The overall accuracy of
the system is around 95%. We further investigated the minimum number of electrodes required by this system

to have the same level of performance. It was concluded that the system performs equally well with only seven
electrodes. The simplified system was tested on the same subjects and the overall accuracy of the system is
around 95%. The robotic arm created in this project is controlled by facial expressions, which may not be a
very ideal method. The ideal way to control the artificial limbs is using thought or imagination without making
any physical movement. To enhance this system into an ideal system, deeper research on cognitive neuroscience
is necessary.
