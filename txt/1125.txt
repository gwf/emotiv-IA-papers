In this paper, a hybrid electroencephalography–functional near-infrared spectroscopy
(EEG–fNIRS) scheme to decode eight active brain commands from the frontal brain
region for brain–computer interface is presented. A total of eight commands are decoded
by fNIRS, as positioned on the prefrontal cortex, and by EEG, around the frontal, parietal, and visual cortices. Mental arithmetic, mental counting, mental rotation, and word
formation tasks are decoded with fNIRS, in which the selected features for classification
and command generation are the peak, minimum, and mean ΔHbO values within a 2-s
moving window. In the case of EEG, two eyeblinks, three eyeblinks, and eye movement
in the up/down and left/right directions are used for four-command generation. The
features in this case are the number of peaks and the mean of the EEG signal during
1 s window. We tested the generated commands on a quadcopter in an open space.
An average accuracy of 75.6% was achieved with fNIRS for four-command decoding
and 86% with EEG for another four-command decoding. The testing results show the
possibility of controlling a quadcopter online and in real-time using eight commands from
the prefrontal and frontal cortices via the proposed hybrid EEG–fNIRS interface.

INTRODUCTION
Brain–computer interface (BCI) or brain–machine interface (BMI) is a method of communication
between brain and hardware by means of signals generated from the brain without the involvement
of muscles and peripheral nervous system (Naseer and Hong, 2015b; Schroeder and Chestek, 2016).
Although prosthetic devices utilize muscles or peripheral nerve signals (Ravindra and Castellini,
2014; Chadwell et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016), brain signals are equally viable for provision of direct
neural signals for interface purposes (Waldert et al., 2009; Quandt et al., 2012; Kao et al., 2014). A
BCI, specifically, is an artificial intelligence system that can recognize a certain set of patterns generated by brain. The BCI promises as a platform to improve the quality of life of individuals with severe
motor disabilities (Muller-Putz et al., 2015). The BCI procedure when acquiring control commands
from the brain consists of five steps: signal acquisition, signal enhancement, feature extraction, classification, and control-interfacing (Nicolas-Alonso and Gomez-Gil, 2012).
The complicated surgical procedures performed for microelectrode implantation and establishment of BCI have been outstandingly successful in achieving control of robotic and prosthetic arms

by means of neuronal-signal acquisition (Hochberg et al., 2006,
2012). These methods, however, are far from perfect options for
BCI purposes, as they are all invasive and incur significant risks
(Jerbi et al., 2011; Schultz and Kuiken, 2011; Rak et al., 2012;
Ortiz-Rosario and Adeli, 2013).
The alternative non-invasive methods measure brain activities via either detection of electrophysiological signals (Li et al.,
2010; Bai et al., 2015; Weyand et al., 2015) or determination of
hemodynamic response (Bhutta et al., 2014; Ruiz et al., 2014;
Hong et al., 2015; Naseer and Hong, 2015a; Weyand et al., 2015).
Electrophysiological activity is generated by the neuronal firings
prompted in the performance of brain tasks (Guntekin and Basar,
2016). The hemodynamic response is the increase of hemoglobin
as a result of the neuronal firing that occurs when the brain
performs an activity (Ferrari and Quaresima, 2012; Boas et al.,
2014). The leading non-invasive BCI modalities in terms of cost
and portability are electroencephalography (EEG) and functional
near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) (von Luhmann et al., 2015;
Lin and Hsieh, 2016). The selection criterion for each modality
is task dependent.
Electroencephalography has applications for active-, passive-,
and reactive-type BCIs (Turnip et al., 2011; Zander and Kothe,
2011; Turnip and Hong, 2012; Urgen et al., 2013; Yoo et al.,
2014). It is most widely employed with reactive-type tasks in the
performance of which the brain output is generated in reaction
to external stimulation. Commands are generated by detection of
steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) and P300-based
activations (Li et al., 2010, 2013; Turnip and Hong, 2012; Cao
et al., 2014; Bai et al., 2015). fNIRS-based BCIs, meanwhile, are
most commonly of the active type, which obtains brain activity
output via user intentionality, independent of external events.
For the purposes of fNIRS-based active BCIs, mostly mental
(e.g., math, counting, etc.) and motor-related tasks (e.g., motor
imagery) are selected (Naseer et al., 2014; Hong et al., 2015;
Hong and Naseer, 2016). Although recent studies have shown
the importance of fNIRS-based BCI for reactive and passive tasks
(Hu et al., 2012; Santosa et al., 2014; Bhutta et al., 2015; Khan
and Hong, 2015), active-type tasks are primarily used to increase
the number of commands for this modality. The active-type
BCI is preferred over the reactive BCI, as it allows a person to
communicate with a machine at will. For both EEG and fNIRS,
the drawback of increasing the number of active commands is
the decrease in accuracy for BCI (Vuckovic and Sepulveda, 2012;
Naseer and Hong, 2015a).
As a means of compensating for the accuracy reduction
problem is the use of a single-brain signal acquisition modality,
the hybrid BCI concept was proposed (Pfurtscheller et al., 2010).
The design of a hybrid BCI entails the combination of either two
modalities (at least one of which is a brain signal acquisition
modality) or different brain signals (e.g., SSVEP and P300). The
EEG–fNIRS-based hybrid BCI has been reported to enhance
classification accuracy (Fazli et al., 2012; Putze et al., 2014; Tomita
et al., 2014) and increase the number of commands (Khan et al.,
2014). Classification accuracy can be improved by simultaneously decoding EEG and fNIRS signals for the same activity and
combining the features. The number of active commands can be
increased by decoding brain activities from different brain regions

Frontiers in Neurorobotics | www.frontiersin.org

(e.g., motor tasks for EEG and mental tasks for fNIRS). However,
for these cases, the reported window size using fNIRS for optimal
classification is around 10 s (Tomita et al., 2014). The problem
of window size reduction and others relevant to real-time/online
BCI applications require further research. Table 1 summarizes
the most recent work (Kim et al., 2014; Bai et al., 2015; Combaz
and Van Hulle, 2015; Hortal et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2015; Naseer
and Hong, 2015a; Ramli et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2015) in terms of
command number, accuracy, and window size as those parameters relate to robotic-control applications.
In the present BCI research, we decoded eight active commands using signals from the frontal and prefrontal cortices.
Four tasks (mental math, mental counting, word formation, and
mental rotation) were decoded using fNIRS, and four eye movement signals (up/down eye movement, left/right eye movement,
twice or three times eyeblinks) were decoded using EEG. In the
fNIRS classification and generation of commands, a 0- to 2-s
window was used, whereas in the case of EEG, a 1-s window was
used. The commands thus generated were used to update a quadcopter’s movement coordinates (six movements and start/stop).
Revealing the obtained results briefly, the signal mean, peak, and
minimum-value features obtained using oxyhemoglobin data in
0–2 s window provided 76.5% accurate classification. For EEG,
signal peak and number of peaks achieved 86% accurate results.
The testing of the drone in an arena showed the possibility of
quadcopter control using eight-brain commands from the frontal
cortex. To the authors’ best knowledge, this is the first fNIRS study
to decode and classify brain activity in 0–2 s window. Also, this
is the first study to decode four commands from the prefrontal
cortex using fNIRS. Moreover, this work shows the first hybrid
EEG–fNIRS-based decoding of eight active commands from the
frontal and prefrontal cortices.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects

A total of 10 healthy adults were recruited (all right-handed
males; mean age: 28.5 ± 4.8). Right-handers had been sought
in order to minimize any variations in the electrophysiological
and hemodynamic responses due to the hemispheric dominance
difference. None of the selected participants had participated in
any previous brain signal acquisition experiment, and none had a
history of any psychiatric, neurological, or visual disorder. All of
them had normal or corrected to normal vision, and all provided
a written consent after having been informed in detail about the
experimental procedure. Experiments with fNIRS and EEG were
approved by the Institutional Review Board of Pusan National
University, and they were conducted in accordance with the ethical standards encoded in the latest Declaration of Helsinki.

Electrode/Optode Placement

The frequency domain system ISS Imagent (ISS Inc., USA)
was used for the signal acquisition. A total of eight sources
and two detectors, making a combination of 16 channels, were
positioned around the prefrontal cortex. The FPz location was
positioned between the two detectors. The Emotiv EEG headset
(Emotiv Epoc, USA) was used to acquire the EEG signals. The

electrodes/optodes were positioned on the head according to the
International 10–20 system (Jurcak et al., 2007). The electrode
and optode placement is illustrated in Figure 1.

Training Session

For the training session, the subjects were seated in a comfortable chair and told to relax. A computer monitor was set up
approximately 70 cm in front of the subjects. The session began
with a resting period of 2 min to establish a data baseline. After
the resting period, the screen cued the participants to perform
one of eight specific tasks. The tasks were as follows:

Experimental Procedure

The experimental procedure consisted of two sessions: training
and testing. The subjects were trained to perform eight tasks
detected simultaneously by EEG and fNIRS, after which the
recorded brain activities were tested using real-time/online
analysis.

• Mental counting: counting backward from a displayed number;
• Mental arithmetic: subtraction of two-digit numbers
from three-digit numbers in pseudo random order (e.g.,
233 − 52 = ?, ? − 23 = ?);
• Mental rotation: visualization of the clockwise rotation of a
displayed stationary object (i.e., a cube);
• Word formation: formation of five scrambled words (e.g.,
“lloonab”), the first letter of which is shown as a cue (e.g., “B”);
• Two eyeblinks: blinking twice within 1 s window;
• Three eyeblinks: blinking thrice within 1 s window;
• Up/down eye movement: movement of both eyes in the up or
down direction within 1 s window;
• Left/right eye movement: movement of both eyes in the left or
right direction.
The mental tasks were recorded mainly using fNIRS, as
the previous work (Weyand et al., 2015) has shown its utility
for high-accuracy detection of the above-noted tasks. The eye
movement tasks were recorded principally using EEG, as the
Emotiv EEG head set, as noted earlier, is commercially available
as a system for detection of various facial movements and motor
signals. The training session was divided into two parts: mental
task training and eye movement training. In the first part, the
subjects were trained for mental arithmetic, counting, rotation,
as well as word formation tasks. Each task consisted of five 10-s
trials separated by a 20-s resting session. In the second part of
the training session, the subjects were instructed to move their
eyes according to the cue given. Each trial in this case was 5 s in
duration, and the resting period was 10 s. Details on the experimental paradigm and data recording sequence are provided in
Figure 2.

Testing Session

As part of the testing session, the training data were used to test
the movement of a quadcopter (Parrot AR drone 2.0, Parrot SA.,
France). Specifically, the eight commands recorded during the
training session were used to navigate the quadcopter in an open
arena. The data were translated into commands and the subjects
were asked to move the quadcopter in a rectangular path.

Signal Acquisition and Processing

The data for both modalities (EEG and fNIRS) were independently
processed and filtered to acquire the desired output signals. In
both cases, band-pass filtering was used to remove physiological
noise from the acquired signals.

Hybrid EEG–fNIRS-Based Control

Channel Selection

Several channels were activated for both EEG and fNIRS. Proper
channel selection is essential to the high-accuracy generation
of commands. Previous work has employed t-value-based
approaches (Hong and Nguyen, 2014; Hong and Santosa, 2016),
bundled-optode-based approaches (Nguyen and Hong, 2016;
Nguyen et al., 2016), and channel-averaging approaches (Khan
and Hong, 2015; Naseer and Hong, 2015a). Other studies
alternatively have employed their own algorithms, for instance,
independent component analysis, etc. (Hu et al., 2010; Kamran
and Hong, 2013; Santosa et al., 2013). We used the following
criteria for selection of fNIRS and EEG channels.

fNIRS Channel Selection

FIGURE 2 | Experimental paradigm of a training session (per subject).
After the initial 2-min rest, each functional near-infrared spectroscopy
recording block consists of five 10-s activations and five 20-s rests, while
each electroencephalography block consists of five 15-s tasks and five 10-s
rests. The total duration of the experiment is 17 min.

For fNIRS channel selection, we calculated the peak (max) value
of ΔHbO in the baseline and in the first trials of the mental arithmetic, mental counting, mental rotation, and word formation
tasks, respectively. If the difference between the max value of the
trial and the baseline value was positive, the channel was selected
for classification; if neutral or negative (equal to or less than zero),
it was discarded.

acquire the data. The modified Beer-Lambert law (Baker et al.,
2014; Bhatt et al., 2016) was utilized to convert the data into
concentrated changes of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin (ΔHbO
and ΔHbR):
A(t ; λ) = ln

I in (λ)
= α(λ) × c(λ) × l × d(λ) + η,
I out (t ; λ)

EEG Channel Selection

In case of EEG, we measured the power spectrum for each
channel. The selected channels were those in which the signal
power corresponding to the eyeblink and movement tasks was
significant. Mostly the channels near the frontal brain region were
active in this case.

Feature Extraction and Classification

In order to generate commands, we first extracted the relevant
features for classification. We selected signal peak and signal
mean as features as, according to the literature (Khan and Hong,
2015), they provide better performance for fNIRS-based BCI
systems. Also, in consideration of a recently reported possibility of an initial fNIRS signal dip (Hong and Naseer, 2016; Zafar
and Hong, 2017), we added a minimum (min) signal value as
a feature. We also investigated the possibility of minimizing the
time for command generation by means of 0–1, 0–1.5, and 0–2 s
windows.
For EEG signals, following channel selection we selected
the signal mean and number of peaks as features for command
generation. In this case, we used a moving window of 1 s to extract
the relevant feature values.
For both modalities, MATLAB®-based functions were used
to calculate the features of the mean, peak, min, and number of
peaks. For offline processing, the extracted features were rescaled
between 0 and 1 by the equation

where A is the absorbance of light (optical density), Iin is the
incident intensity of light, Iout is the detected intensity of light, α
is the specific extinction coefficient in µM−1 cm−1, c is the absorber
concentration in micromolars, l is the distance between the source
and the detector in centimeters, d is the differential path-length
factor, and η is the loss of light due to scattering.
The data were first preprocessed to remove physiological
noises related to respiration, cardiac, and low-frequency drift
signals. In order to minimize the physiological noise due to
heart pulsation (1–1.5 Hz for adults), respiration (approximately
0.4 Hz for adults), and eye movement (0.3–1 Hz), the signals
were low-pass filtered using a fourth-order Butterworth filter at a
cutoff frequency of 0.15 Hz. The low-frequency drift signals were
minimized from the data using a high-pass filter with a cutoff
frequency of 0.033 Hz (Kamran and Hong, 2014; Bhutta et al.,
2015; Hong and Santosa, 2016).

filtering between 8 and 12 Hz, 12 and 28 Hz, 0.5 and 4 Hz, and
4 and 8 Hz, respectively, enabled isolation of the electrodes corresponding to the eye movement activities (Lotte et al., 2007;

we found it to be faster than support vector machine (Khan and

by Wi-Fi communication. The quadcopter has navigated using
the transmitted commands. Figure 3 provides a block diagram
of the BCI scheme for quadcopter control.

RESULTS
Figure 4 plots Subject 2’s ΔHbO values for all 16 channels and
four activities. It can be seen that not all of the channels were
active when performing a brain activity. However, for all four
of the mental tasks, the activation pattern appears in the same
channels.
The plots in Figure 4 serve to emphasize the necessity of
selecting proper channels for distinguishing of brain activities. As per our channel-selection criterion, we subtracted the
max value in the baseline from the max value of the first trial.
Accordingly, channels 4, 9, and 10 were selected for Subject
2, whereas channel 8 was not, due to having a higher value of
baseline. We intended to identify different brain channels for
different activities; therefore, as per our criterion, the subtraction of the first trial for each activity can identify different
channels. However, in this case, for all subjects selected, the
common channels were activated as corresponding to the
mental tasks.
As various windows sizes have been used for detection of fNIRS
features in different studies (Utsugi et al., 2008; Luu and Chau,
2009; Power et al., 2010; Naseer and Hong, 2013; Schudlo et al.,
2013; Schudlo and Chau, 2015; Weyand and Chau, 2015; Weyand
et al., 2015; Naseer et al., 2016a,b), we intended to minimize the
window size applicable to BCI applications. We therefore selected
0–0.5, 0–1, 0–1.5, and 0–2 s windows for feature acquisition
and investigated both hemodynamic and initial dip features to
acquire the best window size for reduced computation time. The
signals of Subject 2 as averaged over all of the trials in the reduced
window are plotted in Figure 5.
In the case of EEG, we examined the power spectrum in
order to identify the activated channels. The F3, F4, O1, and O2

Control Scheme for Quadcopter

For control of the quadcopter, we formulated eight commands for
classification: up/down movements, clockwise/counterclockwise
rotations, forward/backward movements, and start/stop. After
classification, we updated the quadcopter’s movement coordinates

regions were most active. We selected the channel showing the
highest power corresponding to the eye movement task. Figure 6
plots the normalized power spectrum of the selected channel for
Subject 2.
The accuracies obtained for fNIRS are shown in Table 2. The
accuracies achieved using EEG for the selected channels are
shown in Table 3.
For real-time/online testing, we associated each activity with
quadcopter movement. The associated activity for each is shown
in Figure 7.
We associated opposite movements with EEG/fNIRS activities; for example, if forward movement was associated with EEG
signals, backward movement was associated with fNIRS signals.
This was done to ensure safety from the quadcopter and anyone in the area. This scheme has benefits in any case, as, if a
command is misclassified/misinterpreted, a command with the
second modality can be generated to countermove the misclassified movement. As per Figure 7, when EEG was used for one
motion, fNIRS was used for its counter motion. This selection
reflected EEG’s demonstratively higher accuracy for most of the
subjects.
We have tested the movement of the quadcopter in an arena.
The subjects were asked to move the quadcopter in a rectangular
path. They were asked to land the quadcopter near to the takeoff
position. After take off, the subjects were informed to move the
drone almost 3 m in forward direction, then 2 m to the left. The
subjects had to increase the height by almost 0.5 m when reaching

Frontiers in Neurorobotics | www.frontiersin.org

the left corner. After increasing the height, the subjects were to
move the quadcopter backward 3 m and then 2 m to the right
to reach the takeoff spot. After reaching the final position, the
subjects were asked to land the drone. The path followed by the
drone from Subject 2 is shown in Figure 8.
Since the drone requires quick response commands to maneuver, it can be clearly seen that the path was not properly followed.
The subject had to adjust the path to the desired path to reach the
final position. This is due to the delay in command generation
and transmission to the drone for movement control. Further
improvement can be made by incorporating an adaptive control
algorithm to the drone’s control and reduction of window size to
stabilize the trajectory followed by the drone.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we decoded eight active brain commands using
hybrid EEG–fNIRS for BCI. The generated commands were
tested using a quadcopter. To the best of the authors’ knowledge,
there are only two previous studies that have tested their BCI
schemes for control of a quadcopter in 3D space (LaFleur et al.,
2013; Kim et al., 2014). Our work has an advantage over both
studies, as we were able to control the quadcopter with a greater
number of active commands. LaFleur et al. (2013) controlled the
height and rotation of a quadcopter using motor imageries for
the left, right, and both hands. However, in this case, the quadcopter was given a fixed forward speed. Therefore, this work did

not give full quadcopter control to the user for navigation. Also,
as it is impossible for some subjects to perform motor imagery
(Vidaurre and Blankertz, 2010), their scheme is suited only to a
specific set of users who can in fact perform it. Kim et al. (2014)
integrated EEG with an eye tracker for generation of eight commands. Although their eye tracking was effective, an LED-based
flash light was used to monitor the eye movement. As such, with
the illuminating LED enhancing the contrast between the pupil
and iris, it would be difficult to maintain quadcopter-controlling
concentration for any significant span of time. In our case, there
are no such drawbacks, as the necessary mental and eye movement commands are easy to generate. Also, our scheme yields
more freedom to the user for drone control. It also includes a
measure—specifically EEG/fNIRS integration—for avoidance
of any miss-directional movement. A given EEG command has
been matched with an opposing fNIRS command (see Figure 7).
Thus, in the event that an EEG command is incorrectly classified
and the quadcopter follows a wrong direction, fNIRS signals can
be used to counteract that command.
Our proposed scheme for fNIRS classification incorporates
features for both hemodynamics and initial dips. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work to generate commands in a

was used. Although the reported optimal window size, which is
to say, the size allowing for the highest classification accuracy,
is 2–7 s (Naseer and Hong, 2013), the 0–2 s window size, albeit
causing a decrease in accuracy, is still usable for BCI. Also, we
used the mean, min, and peak values of ΔHbO for classification.

Further investigation of feature selection and the use of adaptive
algorithms will improve the results in both window size and
classification.
Another advantage of the proposed scheme is its decoding
of all four fNIRS activities from the prefrontal cortex. In previous research (Naseer and Hong, 2015a), four choices have been
decoded using fNIRS in a 2–7 s window. However, in this case,
only two classes were decoded from the prefrontal cortex, the
other two commands having been generated using data from
the motor cortex. Our proposed work is more advantageous for
more users, as those suffering from locked-in syndrome cannot
properly perform motor tasks. Another advantage of our work is
the reduced command-generation time using fNIRS. This enables
patients who are partially locked-in (with minor eye movements)
to use eight commands in controlling a robot in online/real-time
scenarios.
A previous fNIRS study (Hong and Santosa, 2016) proposed
channel selection based on a t-value criterion. It classified four
sound categories from the auditory cortex using the channels’

highest t-values. In our approach, we used the baseline as a reference for selection of channels. For classification, we selected, for
four prefrontal activities, the common channels yielding a positive value after taking the difference between the peak value and
the baseline. The drawback here is that only a limited number of
channels can be selected. The algorithm can be further improved
by adding the “difference of mean” for channel selection. In the
comparison of our approach with t-value-based channel selection
(see Table 4), most of the selected channels were common. It can
be seen that the t-value-based scheme can identify more active
channels. However, channel detection time also is an important
factor for real-time applications, and our proposed scheme can
identify the activated channels much quicker than the previous
schemes. Thus, our method allows much room for further development in terms of command generation and real-time control.
A limitation of this method is the acquisition of activities using
eye movement tasks. Although the use of eye movement for robot
control has already been demonstrated to be effective (Ma et al.,
2015), eye movements are related to motor activity, and so, it is
difficult for motor-disabled patients to generate four EEG-based
commands. The selection of different active tasks for EEG can
improve the results. Another, fNIRS-related limitation of the
proposed method is the variation in hemodynamic responses in
subjects due to trial-to-trial variability (Hu et al., 2013). Granted,
the proposed features (peak, mean, and min ΔHbO) might not
yield the best performance for each subject in the 0–2 s window.
However, this problem is not insoluble, and certainly, it will be
addressed in further investigations into feature selection. Also,
the use of adaptive algorithms promises improvement in fNIRS
command generation time.

by combining electroencephalography and functional nearinfrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for a BCI. Four EEG commands
were generated by eye movements (two and three blinks as
well as left/right and up/down movements), using the number
of peaks and the mean value as features. In the case of fNIRS,
we chose mental counting, mental arithmetic, mental rotation,
and word formation tasks for the purpose of activity decoding.
We selected a 0–2 s window to generate the commands using
fNIRS signals. The signal mean, peak, and minimum values were
used as features for incorporation of hemodynamic signals and
initial dip features in the classifier. The obtained 76.5% accuracy
indicates the possibility of classifying the activities in reduced
windows. We tested the generated commands in a real-time
scenario using a quadcopter. The movement coordinates of the
quadcopter were updated using the hybrid EEG–fNIRS-based
commands. The performed experiments served to demonstrate

CONCLUSION
In this study, we investigated the possibility of decoding
eight commands from the frontal and prefrontal cortices
