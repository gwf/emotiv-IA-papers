unexplored. Reflection and debates about neurotechnology for human enhancement
are limited and remain predominantly with neurotech engineers, science-fiction
enthusiasts and a small circle of academics in the field of neuroethics. It is well
known, and described as the Collingridge dilemma, that at an early stage of development, changes can easily be enacted, but the need for changes can hardly be foreseen. Once the technology is entrenched, opportunities and risks start to materialize,
and the need to adapt and change is clearly visible. However, carrying out these
changes at such a late stage, in turn, becomes very difficult, tremendously expensive,
and sometimes practically impossible. In this manuscript, we compile and categorize

neurotechnologies, with the aim to find out, if these real or diegetic prototypes could
be used to better understand the paths these applications are forging. In particular,
we will investigate what kind of tools, motivations, and normative goals underpin
experimental implementations by neurohackers, speculative designers and artists.

It is shown that social closeness between teacher and student are of

user then experiences sensations that are similar to physical reactions

Hertrich's work is closely related to research done by David Eagleman
that uses a haptic vest to input information into the back of the
wearer (Novich & Eagleman, 2015). The research explores the possible information streams that our brains can learn to understand and
feel as an additional sense. In a TED talk, Eagleman hypothesizes
about how this could be used to get a feeling for multi measurement

we might understand (Eagleman, 2015).

5 | MOTIVATIONS
For each of the described categories (Med+, Enhancement, Speculative) different motivations, goals and normalization levels can be distinguished. The Med + category for both invasive and noninvasive
technologies is marked by motivations to overcome mental or physical
disabilities (Emmerson, 2018), for pain relief (Kapural et al., 2010), or,
in fact, unraveling the mystery of consciousness (or unconsciousness)
(Guger et al., 2017). But Med + devices can also work beyond the
conventional medical uses—a cochlear implant can function as an aid
to hear sounds, not within the usual human accesible frequency range,
and the research put into a retinal prosthesis may well serve as a base
for bionic eyes. The noninvasive devices in this category have also
been first conceptualized from a medical or therapeutical standpoint,
but hold the potential or actually can be used for other purposes.
On the border between Med + and Enhancement, we find health

tracking, self-optimization or self-monitoring as the driving forces.

– Influence liquid (Smigielska &

smart watches to track and self-optimize their selves, these activities

– Tracking and influencing of
dreams (DreamLab, 2018)
– Increase sleep for athletes (Abeln,
Kleinert, Strüder, & Schneider,
2014)
– Self-tracking (Swan, 2013)

Similarly to how users around the world are currently using apps and
could (in the near future) also be done via invasive or noninvasive
neurotechnology. These activities are mainly motivated by self-control
and self-improvement (Wexler, 2017) or self-actualization, and are
mostly embedded in a competitive market economy environment.
The Enhancement category is defined by practical reasons, identity or self-esteem factors, but also the motivation to change how
life is experienced. Practical reasons are defined by goals that range
from the general enhancement of human abilities and intelligence

engineering, biology and risk assessment, he
carried out risk assessment and public perception studies in various fields, such as GMcrops, nanotechnology, converging technologies, synthetic biology
and neurotechnology. He published over 35 peer review papers
and three edited books. In addition to the scientific work, he supports the democratization of science and technology, engages in a
number of public dialog activities and finds inspiration in the collaboration between art and science. He initiated and co-curated
the BIOFICTION Science Art Film Festival (2011, 2014, and
