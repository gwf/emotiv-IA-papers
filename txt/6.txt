Abstract. Electroencephalogram (EEG) techniques are traditionally
used in the medical ﬁeld. Recent research work focuses on applying these
techniques to daily life with wireless and relatively low-price EEG devices
available in the market. As a result, applications such as neurofeedback
training, neuromarketing, emotion, stress, mental workload recognition,
etc. using EEG techniques on healthy adults have been developed. Since
the EEG measures and records electrical activity in the brain, it is possible
for it to reﬂect a person’s brain states. In this paper, we describe a novel
brain computer interface called CogniMeter integrated with proposed realtime emotion, mental workload, and stress recognition algorithms. With
this system, we can assess human emotions, mental workload, and stress in
real time. This work can be applied as a human study tool in many ﬁelds.
For example, the wellbeing of users within a system or workers in industry
can be monitored to improve their protection from overly stressful workload conditions. In research, brain state monitoring can be applied in simulation scenarios during human factor study experiments. In marketing,
a person’s emotional response toward products or advertisements can be
studied using EEG-based brain states monitoring.

Introduction

With an increasing number of wearable devices (Apple Watch, Fitbit, and Jowbone) becoming available in the commercial market, it becomes popular to use
such wearable devices and mobile phones to monitor our daily physiological
states based on number of walking steps, heart rate, calories consumed, and
sleep pattern. All signals read by these wearable devices come either from the
muscle activities or movement of the user. This however, limits the ability of
these devices to monitor people’s mental states. A brain computer interface is
more suitable for such analysis since Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are

directly captured from brain activity. A number of EEG-based methods and corresponding applications have been designed and implemented in order to recognize the user’s brain states [1–3]. However, most of the contemporary works
neither process EEG data in real time nor provide intuitive visualization tools
for data analysis and decision making.
The EEG-based visualization of brain states can provide additional insights
for human factor study experiments. In experimental design and analysis, the
visualization tool can enable researchers to directly observe the relationship
between task variables and subject’s states. In [40], an EEG-based brain states
monitoring system is proposed to monitor emotion, mental workload and stress
in real time simultaneously. The stress level is inferred from emotion and workload recognition. In this paper, we describe a new version of the brain states
monitoring system CogniMeter integrated with updated mental workload and
stress recognition algorithms.
This paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 introduces related work on EEG
visualization tools and EEG-based emotion, mental workload and stress recognition algorithms. Section 3 presents the methodology used to implement these
algorithms. Section 4 introduces the structure of the proposed visualization system and details of the visualization tools used to monitor brain states from EEG
signals. Section 5 gives the conclusion.

2.1

Related Work
Visualization Tools

There are a number of tools for analysis and visualization of EEG data such as
EEGLab [4], Brainstorm [5], and ELAN [6]. These systems provide graphic user
interfaces which enable users to interactively process high-density EEG data.
For intuitive observation of brain activity, the amplitudes of EEG signals can
be mapped to a 2-D or 3-D model of the scalp according to the EEG channel
positions. These visualization tools are able to process EEG data epochs using
spectral analysis or independent component analysis [4]. In [7], a blobby model
is implemented for EEG signal visualization onto a 3D head model.
Because EEG signals are non-stationary and high-dimensional, machine
learning methods can be used for eﬃcient real-time analysis of brain activity
with speciﬁc tasks [8]. In this way, visualization tools can provide further interpretation of mental states from EEG data instead of showing only amplitudes of
diﬀerent channels. In [9], an EEG-based workload gauge is implemented and the
workload level is monitored when subjects are doing cognitive and operational
Air Traﬃc Controller’s (ATC) tasks. It is critical to reliably measure the brain
states and performance of the controllers/pilots when the mode of automation
is changed or when new tasks appear. During simulation of the ATC task, the
workload gauge is updated with the recognized level of workload (three workload
levels). Other gauges depict dynamic changes in EEG signals and show spectrum
powers in the form of brain maps simultaneously. In [8], an EEG-based mental
text entry system Hex-o-Spell is proposed. By imagining left/right hand movement, the user can generate diﬀerent brain patterns. These patterns are used to

110

control visual text input. The visualization tools include a text dial, an arrow,
and a bar. The arrow’s orientaion and the graphic bar’s length are controlled by
the brain states.
2.2

Emotion

Emotions can be deﬁned from a dimensional perspective where arousal, valence,
and dominance dimensions are considered [10]. In the dimensional model, the
arousal dimension ranges from not aroused to excited, the valence dimension
ranges from negative to positive, and the dominance dimension ranges from being
controlled to being in control. The dimensional model is preferable for emotion
recognition because it allows the location of discrete emotions in the dimensional
space. Even feelings that cannot be described in words can be located using the
dimensional model [11]. Emotions can be induced by diﬀerent kinds of stimuli
such as audio, visual and combined ones [12]. Diﬀerent algorithms have been
proposed for EEG-based emotion recognition. [3] extracted power features from
EEG data and used Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classiﬁer. 82.37 %
accuracy for distinguishing four emotions was achieved with 32 channels. In
[13], Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) as a feature extraction method and
SVM as a classiﬁer were applied and a mean accuracy of 62.07 % was obtained
with 16 channels. However, all these accuracies were achieved for oﬀ-line emotion
recognition only. As the EEG signal is nonlinear and chaotic, traditional features
may be hard to capture the nonlinear property of EEG. The fractal dimension
(FD) can reﬂect changes of the EEG signal during diﬀerent mental tasks in real
time [15]. In [16], FD, statistical and Higher Order Crossings (HOC) features
were used for real-time EEG-based emotion recognition.
2.3

Mental Workload

Mental workload is described as a noticeable relationship between the human
cognitive capacity and the eﬀort required to process a particular function [17].
There are mainly three broad categories for workload deﬁnition: physiological,
subjective, and cognitive workloads [18]. In this research, we are interested in
cognitive workload which indicates the capability of a person to complete a task
with some amount of mental eﬀort. Performance in the task ascertains the cognitive workload [19]. In [8], mental workload is evaluated in online EEG monitoring during a security surveillance task. By comparing the mental workload index
with the error rate of the subjects, the correlation coeﬃcient is approximately
0.7, which indicates that when the workload increases, people have a tendency
to make more errors. The signiﬁcant positive correlation between workload and
theta band power has been proven in [20–22]. In experiment [20], it is shown
that the EEG theta band power increases when the workload is induced with
a mental arithmetic task. In [21], the driver’s mental workload is signiﬁcantly
correlated with theta band power and alpha band power. In diﬀerent driving
tasks, the frontal theta activity shows signiﬁcant increase when working memory load increases. In another experiment studying the workload and fatigue in

CogniMeter: EEG-Based Brain States Monitoring

111

aircraft pilots [22], increased EEG theta band power and decreased alpha band
power was observed during high mental workload as compared with low mental
workload conditions. Additionally, in [22] it is shown that when the pilots have
high mental workload and mental fatigue, their EEG theta band power, as well
as delta and alpha band power increases.
2.4

Stress

Stress is a human state which is caused by a number of reasons, including high
mental workload, emotions, or environmental inﬂuences. The stress can be measured and assessed from physiological variables including EEG [1,2,23,24], blood
pressure [25], heart rate variability [26], and skin conductance level [27]. EEG can
be used to detect human stress levels. In work [25], the experiment shows that the
stress is positively correlated with beta EEG power at the anterior temporal lobe.
In [2], higher order spectra features are used for stress recognition. The SVM
with RBF kernel is chosen as a classiﬁer and the accuracy calculated with 5-fold
cross validation for recognition of two stress states is 79.2 %. In [23], features
such as Gaussian mixtures of EEG spectrogram, fractal dimension and magnitude square coherence estimation are used in the stress recognition algorithm.
The classiﬁcation of two levels of mental stress is done by k-Nearest Neighbor
(k-NN) and SVM classiﬁers, and the best accuracy is 90 %. However, neither [2]
nor [23] used a standard stressor to induce stress in the experiments. In [1], a
Stroop color-word test is used to induce stress. The discrete cosine transform is
applied to reduce the data size and extract features from the frequency domain.
Classiﬁcation is implemented with an artiﬁcial neural network, linear discriminant analysis and k-NN. The best classiﬁcation result for two stress states is
72 % with k-NN. In [24], the band power of theta, alpha, and beta are used as
features in logistic regression and are fed into the k-NN classiﬁer. The results
show a median accuracy of 73.96 % for the recognition of relaxed and stressed
states.

Fractal Dimension Feature. FD measures the complexity and irregularity of
a time series [29]. It can be used as an index for characterizing the complexities
of EEG signals. For a regular signal, the fractal dimension value is low. If the
signal becomes irregular, the fractal dimension value increases accordingly. Wang
and Sourina [30] proposed to use Higuchi fractal dimension to recognize diﬀerent
arithmetic mental tasks from EEG. It is also used in EEG-based serious games
to identify attention levels [31]. In this paper, the Higuchi algorithm is used
to calculate FD features from EEG data. The idea of Higuchi algorithm is as
follows.
Let X (1) , X (2) , . . . , X (N ) be a ﬁnite set of time series samples. Then, the
newly constructed time series is

dimH =

Thus, the composed FD feature vector is

Statistical Feature. Statistical features are simple and widely used in EEGbased brain states recognition. For example, statistical features were used
in EEG-based emotion recognition algorithms [32,33]. Six statistical features
including mean μX , standard deviation σX , mean of absolute values of the ﬁrst
diﬀerences δX , mean of absolute values of the ﬁrst diﬀerences of normalized
signals δX , mean of absolute values of the second diﬀerences γX , and mean of
the second diﬀerences of the normalized signals γX are extracted from EEG for
emotion recognition. The equations are listed as follows:

Data Processing

In the current version of CogniMeter, we use subject-dependent algorithms. The
subject-dependent algorithms consist of two parts: calibration algorithm and
real-time brain state recognition algorithm. The overall diagram of calibration
and real-time emotion, mental workload and stress recognition algorithms is
shown in Fig. 2. The emotion, mental workload and stress calibration algorithms
follow the same pipeline but with diﬀerent features. Diﬀerent stimuli are used
to induce brain states as well. First, the EEG data are labeled with classes such
as levels of valence, mental workload or stress for emotion, workload or stress
recognition correspondingly. Then, the EEG data are ﬁltered, the corresponding features are extracted and the classiﬁer is trained. After that, for real-time

114

X. Hou et al.

recognition of valence, mental workload or stress levels, raw EEG data is ﬁltered
and the corresponding features are extracted using a 4 s sliding window with
3 s of overlap. Then, the data is input into the classiﬁer with the pre-trained
model acquired during calibration. After that, the classiﬁer assigns the recognized valence, mental workload or stress level to each 4 second of EEG data.

Emotion Recognition. In this paper, the valence recognition algorithm proposed in work [39] is integrated into the CogniMeter system. Emotions can be
evoked by audio or visual stimuli such as IADS [34] and IAPS [35]. The algorithm calibration procedure is described in Sect. 4.1. The algorithm is tested on
10 subjects from DEAP database which is a publicly available aﬀective database.
Fractal dimension is used as the feature and thresholds are employed to classify
the brain states for up to four levels of valence, ranging from very unpleasant to
very pleasant. 12 channels (AF3, F3, F7, T7, P3, P7, AF4, F4, F8, T8, P4, P8)
are used and the weighted average voting strategy is applied to make the ﬁnal
decision about the current valence level. As shown in Table 1, the best accuracy
is 79.31 % and the mean accuracy is 49.4 % for four levels valence recognition.
In the calibration phase, two EEG datasets labeled with very pleasant and very
unpleasant emotion are selected based on the questionnaire. Then, raw EEG
data from the selected 12 channels are ﬁltered with a 2–42 Hz bandpass ﬁlter,
and features are extracted by subtracting the FD values of 6 right-hemispheric
channels from the 6 left-hemispheric channels:
ΔF D = F Dlef t − F Dright , ∀lef t ∈ LH, ∀right ∈ RH

(12)

where a sliding window of size 512 and step size 1 (move forward 1 sample point
at each step) is used to calculate the FD values.

CogniMeter: EEG-Based Brain States Monitoring

115

In the next step, the simple moving average (SMA) function with nonoverlapping window of size of 128 is applied to ΔF D and the obtained
average ΔF D is used as features. To decide the threshold, the maximal and minimal average ΔF D values are obtained and the range between max ΔF D and
min ΔF D is equally divided. As 12 channels are used in the proposed algorithm,
36 channel pairs are obtained (ΔF DAF 3−AF 4 , ΔF DAF 3−F 4 , . . . , ΔF DF P 1−F P 2 ,
ΔF DP 7−P 8 ) which leads to 36 sets of thresholds. In the real-time recognition
phase, the average ΔF D is calculated from each channel pair and compared with
the corresponding set of thresholds. The ﬁnal valence level is determined by the
weighted average vote strategy based on 36 valence results from each channel pair
as follows. Deﬁne C(x) as the function that counts the votes for each valence level,
where argument x ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} is the valence level, 1 denotes the most unpleasant,
2 denotes unpleasant, 3 denotes pleasant, and 4 denotes the most pleasant. C(x)
4
gives the vote counts of valence level x and x=1 C(x) = 36. The ﬁnal valence
level L is determined as:
4
xC(x)
(13)
L = x=1
4
x=1 C(x)
where rounded L value can be used.

Mental Workload Recognition. Mental workload recognition algorithm proposed in [38] is integrated into the CogniMeter system. Since the mental workload is closely related to multitasking, SIMKAP simultaneous capacity test is
used to induce 4 levels of mental workload to calibrate the algorithm. The algorithm calibration procedure is described in Sect. 4.1. The algorithm was tested
on the EEG database of 12 subjects with diﬀerent feature combinations and
classiﬁers used. In Table 2, it is shown, that for all feature combinations, the

116

X. Hou et al.

average accuracy of SVM classiﬁer is 9.56 % higher than k-NN classiﬁer based
on mental workload EEG data. By combining statistical and FD features of 14
channels and using SVM classiﬁer, the best accuracy is 90.39 % for 2 levels mental workload recognition and 80.09 % for 4 levels mental workload recognition.
Thus, in CogniMeter System, for mental workload recognition algorithm, we use
statistical and FD features and SVM classiﬁer. Parameters used for the SVM
classiﬁer are: polynomial kernel with penalty parameter C = 1, degree d = 5,
gamma g = 1, coeﬃcient r = 1. The feature vector deﬁned for mental workload
recognition is described as follows

Stress Recognition. Stress recognition algorithm proposed in [37] is integrated
in the CogniMeter System. For calibration, the Stroop Color Word Test [36] is
adapted to elicit diﬀerent levels of stress. The calibration procedure is described
in Sect. 4.1. The algorithm was tested on the EEG database of 9 subjects where
diﬀerent levels of stress were induced using a Stroop color-word test.
The comparison results shown in Table 3 also shows that the feature combination and classiﬁer setting of stress recognition is very similar to mental workload recognition. By combining fractal dimension and statistical features with
SVM as the classiﬁer, four levels of stress can be recognized with an average
accuracy of 67.06 %, three levels of stress can be recognized with an accuracy of
75.22 %, and two levels of stress can be recognized with an accuracy of 85.71 %.
For SVM classiﬁer, the polynomial kernel is chosen with penalty parameter

Visual Monitoring

Based on the emotion, workload and stress recognition algorithms described, we
propose a real-time EEG-based brain states visual monitoring system named
CogniMeter which is implemented to visualize the recognized brain states like
emotion, workload, and stress levels. The overall pipeline of CogniMeter is illustrated in Fig. 3. It includes two parts: recognition and visualization.
In the recognition part, the raw EEG data stream is obtained from the EEG
device as input. Then, the EEG data is passed through the bandpass ﬁlter (2–
42 Hz). After that, diﬀerent features are extracted from the ﬁltered EEG data.
For emotion recognition, the FD feature is used. For workload and stress recognition, statistical and FD features extracted from EEG data are used. These
extracted features are compared with thresholds (emotion recognition) or fed
into the pre-trained SVM classiﬁer models (stress and workload recognition).
Finally, emotion, workload and stress are recognized in real time.
In the visualization part, a Node.js server is created to receive the recognized
emotion, workload and stress states. These recognized brain states are sent by
each recognition program through TCP sockets. Then, a web browser connects
to the server and renders three meters showing emotion, stress and workload in
real time.

The two advantages of this framework are the independence of recognition
programs and ﬂexibility for use in various applications. When a new algorithm
is proposed or a new EEG device is used, they can be easily integrated to the
visual monitoring system with a TCP connection. If the monitoring system is
deployed in diﬀerent applications like driver’s model study, air traﬃc control
or maritime human factor study, the visualization tools can be easily changed
according to simulation scenarios. The users can monitor a subject’s brain states
even from their tablet PC or smart phones.

Calibration Interface

As the proposed real-time EEG-based brain state recognition algorithms are subject dependent, calibration is required before real-time recognition. Each algorithm has its own calibration interface and calibration procedure.
The emotion calibration interface is shown in Fig. 4. The stimuli to evoke certain emotions can be audio, visual, or both. In our calibration, sound clips from
IADS database [34] targeted at evoking diﬀerent valence levels are chosen and
played one after another to the subjects. EEG data is recorded at the same time
as when the subjects are listening to the sound clips. After each sound clip which
lasts 60 s, the subject completes a prompted questionnaire (shown in Fig. 4a) to
evaluate and describe his/her current emotion and feelings in words. After the
recording is complete, the thresholds are trained based on the recorded EEG
data and given emotional labels and are saved for future use. Figure 4b, shows
the training of positive (happy) and negative (sad) emotions. When the “Go
to Emotion Recognition” button is clicked, the program starts real-time emotion recognition based on the trained thresholds and sends recognized emotional
states to the server.
The interface for mental workload calibration is shown in Fig. 5. SIMKAP
simultaneous capacity test is used to invoke diﬀerent workload levels. In low
mental workload condition, subjects are required to complete item matching for
diﬀerent types of items including numbers, letters and shapes. For high mental workload condition, subjects are required perform multitasking as shown
in Fig. 5a. It combines item matching and auditory questions such as telephone book search, schedule checking and answering arithmetic questions at the
required time. After completing each workload level which lasts 60 s, the subject
ﬁlls a prompted questionnaire to evaluate his/her mental workload level on the
scale from 1 to 9 and also attempts to describe their feelings in words, as shown
in Fig. 5b. Figure 5c shows labels of the recorded EEG data trained as three levels
of workload: no task condition (Relaxed), item matching (Engrossed), and multitasking (Nervous). By clicking the “Start Recognition” button, the recognized
mental workload states are sent to the server in real time.
The interface for stress calibration is shown in Fig. 6. Stroop color-word test,
often used as a reliable psychological stressor, is applied to induce diﬀerent levels
of stress. The test has been shown to be one of the most eﬀective methods for
researching human psychophysiological reactions in a stressful environment. In
the Stroop color-word test, the subjects are given a list of color words in matching
or non-matching colors as shown in Fig. 6a. In the congruent task, the word’s font
color matches with the word’s meaning, e.g. the word “yellow” in a “yellow” font,
and subjects are tasked to identify the word’s font color. For the incongruent
task, the word’s font color and the word’s meaning are diﬀerent, e.g. the word
“yellow” but in a “blue” font, and subjects are required to correctly identify
the word’s font color. Due to the mismatch in font color and word meaning,
the incongruent session is more stressful than congruent section. For the more
stressful task, the subject can be required to make the response within a limited
time (1.5 s). In such a situation, even higher stress levels can be elicited. After

completing each Stroop color-word test, the subject is required to ﬁll a prompted
questionnaire to evaluate his/her stress level on a scale of 1 to 9 and describe
their feeling in words, as shown in Fig. 6b. Figure 6c shows the labels of the
recorded EEG data as ﬁve stress levels: no task condition (Relaxed), congruent
task (Normal), incongruent task (Engrossed), congruent task with time limit
(Stressful), and incongruent task with time limit (Anxious). By clicking “Start
Recognition”, the recognized stress level is sent to the server in real-time.

Visual Meters and Monitoring Report

In the CogniMeter system, the recognized emotion, workload and stress levels
are visualized as meters shown in Fig. 7. These visualization meters are developed based on JustGage [41] using JavaScript. These three meters display the
current emotion, workload or stress level with changing positional angular bars
and gradient colors (from green to red) in real time. A green colored bar on the
workload/stress meter indicates a low workload/stress level, while a red colored
bar represents a high workload/stress level. For the emotion meter, if the subject’s state is positive, the color of the bar will be green. Otherwise, it will be
red. Besides color representation, there is a word in the center of each meter to
describe current workload, emotion, and stress states. The words are updated at
the bottom of the meter and correspond to the meter colors. For workload/stress,
“High” corresponds to red color, “Low” corresponds to green color and “Mid”
corresponds to yellow color. For emotion, “Pos” corresponds to positive emotions
(green) while “Neg” corresponds to negative emotions (red).

level of stress. (Color ﬁgure online)

When the brain states monitoring is complete, a report appears on the screen.
It is developed using HTML5 JavaScript charting library CanvasJS [42] and is
generated to summarize the distribution of emotion, workload and stress states
monitored. For example, Fig. 8 shows the distribution of mental workload in
three levels (Low, Medium, and High), distribution of two emotions (positive and
negative), and distribution of stress in ﬁve levels (Low, Medium low, Medium,
Medium High, and High). The report can help researchers perform better analysis of the changes in a subject’s brain state during experiments.

Conclusion

In this paper, a novel CogniMerter system is proposed and implemented. It
allows monitoring of users real-time emotion, mental workload and stress using
a head mounted EEG device. Visual meters and report generation provide the
possibility to directly observe the relationship between the users emotions, mental workload, stress, and his/her task performance. This can help researchers to
propose new hypotheses and reﬁne their experimental procedures. We extracted
diﬀerent feature combinations and used SVM classiﬁer for real-time emotion,

mental workload and stress recognition. To monitor brain states in real-time,
dynamic meters are proposed and implemented. The CogniMeter system is used
as a novel user study method in diﬀerent simulation scenarios such as air traﬃc
control and maritime training.
