his paper introduces the idea of drawing upon the cognitive neuroscience literature to inform IS research
(herein termed “NeuroIS”). Recent advances in cognitive neuroscience are uncovering the neural bases of
cognitive, emotional, and social processes, and they offer new insights into the complex interplay between IT
and information processing, decision making, and behavior among people, organizations, and markets.
The paper reviews the emerging cognitive neuroscience literature to propose a set of seven opportunities
that IS researchers can use to inform IS phenomena, namely (1) localizing the neural correlates of IS constructs,
(2) capturing hidden mental processes, (3) complementing existing sources of IS data with brain data, (4) identifying antecedents of IS constructs, (5) testing consequences of IS constructs, (6) inferring the temporal ordering
among IS constructs, and (7) challenging assumptions and enhancing IS theories.
The paper proposes a framework for exploring the potential of cognitive neuroscience for IS research and
offers examples of potentially fertile intersections of cognitive neuroscience and IS research in the domains of
design science and human-computer interaction. This is followed by an example NeuroIS study in the context
of e-commerce adoption using fMRI, which spawns interesting new insights. The challenges of using functional neuroimaging tools are also discussed. The paper concludes that there is considerable potential for using
cognitive neuroscience theories and functional brain imaging tools in IS research to enhance IS theories.

Introduction

further advance our knowledge of the complex interplay of IT and information processing, decision making, and behavior. The purpose of this commentary is
to introduce cognitive neuroscience theories, methods,
and tools to IS researchers and encourage them to consider taking advantage of their potential by answering
two questions: How can the cognitive neuroscience literature inform IS research? How can IS researchers
use brain imaging tools to complement their existing
sources of data?
Given the potential of cognitive neuroscience to
revolutionize the social sciences (Economist 2005),
we argue that IS researchers can also benefit from
by drawing upon the theories, methods, and tools
offered by cognitive neuroscience. There is a rich
literature on how people process information (e.g.,
Ferstl et al. 2005), make economic and social decisions
(Hsu et al. 2005), deal with uncertainty and ambiguity (Krain et al. 2006), respond to rewards (McClure
et al. 2004a), make purchases (Deppe et al. 2005), predict the behavior of others (McCabe et al. 2001), trust

To understand the complex and elusive issues concerning the interplay of IT with information processing, decision making, and behavior in individuals,
groups, organizations, and markets, IS research has
long drawn upon leading reference literatures. Over
the past decade, cognitive neuroscience has generated many advances in the basic understanding of
information processing, decision making, and behavior by directly and objectively measuring the brain
activity that underlies various decision-making, cognitive, emotional, and social processes. Economists, psychologists, marketers, and other social scientists are
teaming up with cognitive neuroscientists, and many
novel insights are emerging as a result of directly asking the brain, not the person, and opening the brain’s
“black box” (e.g., Camerer et al. 2004, Glimcher and
Rustichini 2004, Lee et al. 2007, Phan et al. 2002). We
propose that the cognitive neuroscience literature can
also offer new cutting-edge foundations and serve as
a reference discipline for IS research that could help

and cooperate (King-Casas et al. 2005), make calculations (McClure et al. 2004b), and act upon emotional
and cognitive stimuli (Ioannides et al. 2000). Since a
deeper understanding of the underlying brain activity
involved in mental processes can enhance our understanding of how IT can facilitate information processing, decision making, and behavior, many of the rapid
advances in cognitive neuroscience could help inform
IS research by establishing a novel and relatively distinct foundation of literature, theories, methods, and
tools that has the potential to accelerate the progress
of IS research. Currently, IS researchers are beginning
to explore the potential of cognitive neuroscience for
IS research (e.g., Dimoka et al. 2007, Dimoka 2010,
Moore et al. 2005, Randolph et al. 2006). Nonetheless,
we propose that IS research could benefit by leveraging the rapidly evolving cognitive neuroscience literature in the social sciences to enrich IS theories concerning the interplay of IT with human information
processing, decision making, and behavior.
IS researchers typically collect data from surveys, field and lab experiments, interviews, secondary sources, and simulated models. While these
data sources have certainly advanced IS research—by
directly asking the brain, not the person—brain imaging tools might offer objective and unbiased measurement of decision-making, cognitive, emotional, and
social processes. Since functional brain imaging tools
are becoming more accurate, accessible, and affordable, IS research can complement existing data sources
with brain data, particularly for measuring mental
processes that people might be unable or unwilling
to self-report. Given that self-reported data could be
susceptible to multiple measurement biases (e.g., subjectivity, social desirability, common methods), complementing existing sources of IS data with functional
brain imaging data would help triangulate different
measurement methods and data sources, and thereby
strengthen the robustness of empirical IS studies.
Therefore, the cognitive neuroscience literature and
functional brain imaging tools applied to IS research
(termed “NeuroIS”) are proposed to spawn seven
opportunities for IS research (Table 1): (1) localize the
brain areas associated with IS constructs, (2) capture
hidden processes, (3) complement existing sources of
data, (4) identify antecedents of IS constructs, (5) test
consequences, (6) infer causality, and (7) challenge IS
assumptions.
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 offers
examples of how neuroeconomics and neuromarketing have informed economics and marketing theories,
provides an overview of brain anatomy and functionality, identifies several mental processes that relate
to IS research, and offers a review of their associated brain areas. Section 3 elaborates on the proposed
seven opportunities of cognitive neuroscience for IS
research (Table 1) and offers examples in the context

The Proposed Opportunities for IS Research

(1) Localize the various brain areas associated with IS constructs (neural
correlates of IS constructs) and link them to the cognitive
neuroscience literature to map IS constructs into specific brain areas,
learn about the functionality of these brain areas, and better
understand the nature and dimensionality of IS constructs.
(2) Capture hidden (automatic or unconscious) mental processes
(e.g., habits, ethics, deep emotions) that are difficult or even
impossible to measure with existing measurement methods and tools.
(3) Complement existing sources of data with brain imaging data that can
provide objective responses that are not subject to measurement
biases (e.g., subjectivity bias, social desirability bias, common method
bias).
(4) Identify antecedents of IS constructs by examining how brain areas are
activated in response to IT stimuli (e.g., designs, systems, websites)
that intend to enhance certain outcomes (use behavior, productivity).
(5) Test consequences of IS constructs by showing whether, how, and
why brain activation that is associated with certain IS constructs can
predict certain behaviors (e.g., system use, online purchasing).
(6) Infer causal relationships among IS constructs by examining the
temporal order of brain activations (timing of brain activity) stimulated
by a common IT stimulus that activates two or more IS constructs.
(7) Challenge IS assumptions by identifying differences between existing
IS relationships and the brain’s underlying functionality, thus helping
to build IS theories that correspond to the brain’s functionality.

of e-commerce, design science, and human-computer
interaction. Section 4 outlines the general structure
and steps of a NeuroIS study and offers an example
NeuroIS study that examines the technology acceptance constructs in the context of e-commerce. Section 5 discusses the opportunities and implications of
taking advantage of cognitive neuroscience literature
and brain imaging tools in IS research.

Literature Review

2.1.

Example Studies from Neuroeconomics,
Neuromarketing, and NeuroIS
The ability to link brain activity to human behavior has highlighted the potential of cognitive neuroscience for the social sciences. Economics and
psychology pioneered this trend, followed by marketing, and many interesting findings are emerging
in these respective disciplines from functional brain
imaging studies. Also, Glimcher and Rustichini (2004)
argue that neuroeconomics, psychology, and neuromarketing are converging to provide a unified theory
of human behavior by integrating economics, psychology, and marketing under the umbrella of cognitive neuroscience in the social sciences. Table 2 briefly
reviews some representative examples of research
findings in neuroeconomics and neuromarketing, and
it also cites some emerging work in NeuroIS.

Example Studies from Neuroeconomics, Neuromarketing, and NeuroIS
What is neuroeconomics?

Neuroeconomics is the application of cognitive neuroscience to economic behavior using functional brain imaging tools. Neuroeconomics develops models
of economic behavior that are based on measurement of brain activations that underlie human processes, behavior, and decision making in experimental
games where subjects are given different tasks and payoffs (e.g., Rustichini 2005). For a detailed review of the neuroeconomics literature, please see
Camerer et al. (2004).
Example neuroeconomics studies
Cognitive and emotional aspects of decision making: Bhatt and Camerer (2005) showed that decision-making processes have both cognitive and emotional
aspects, and subjects whose brain activity displayed good cooperation between the limbic system (emotional area) and the prefrontal cortex (cognitive
area) were the best performers in experimental games.
Decision making under uncertainty and ambiguity: Hsu and Camerer (2004) showed that a brain area (insular cortex) that is activated in response to adverse
bodily states, such as pain, is activated when subjects have to choose among ambiguous gambles. Yet this area is not activated when the subjects
choose between certain or even uncertain gambles. These results help explain why people loathe ambiguous situations and prefer gambles with
unambiguous probabilities.
Anticipation of gains and losses: The neuroeconomics literature showed that different neural mechanisms govern the anticipation of gains and losses.
Functional brain imaging studies showed that the human brain processes information about gains and losses in different areas. For example, Kuhnen and
Knutson (2005) showed that the prospect of a $5 gain activated a different brain area compared to the prospect of a $5 loss. These findings are
consistent with prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979), which proposes that people weigh gains and losses differently.
Evaluating payoffs and outcomes: Smith et al. (2002) show attitudes about payoffs and beliefs on expected outcomes to interact behaviorally and neurally,
challenging an economic assumption that payoffs and outcomes are independent.
What is neuromarketing?
Neuromarketing is the application of cognitive neuroscience theories and functional brain imaging tools to marketing. By understanding how the human brain
activates in response to marketing and advertising stimuli (Zaltman 2003), neuromarketing aims to build superior models to understand consumer
behavior and market products (Lee et al. 2007). For a comprehensive review of the neuromarketing literature, please see Lee et al. (2007).
Example neuromarketing studies
Consumer behavior: Deppe et al. (2005) showed that a person’s first brand choice activates an area associated with social decision making, while the second
brand choice activates an area associated with cognitive processes. These findings imply impulse versus planned behavior. McClure et al. (2004b)
showed that immediate versus delayed rewards activate distinct brain areas, implying a battle of intertemporal trade-offs between impulse and planned
purchases.
Consumer preferences: McClure et al. (2004c) tried to explain the consumers’ preference for Coke over Pepsi. Using functional brain imaging (fMRI) tools,
the authors show activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (a brain area implicated in cognitive information processing) when notifying subjects
that they are drinking Coke. However, no such activation was observed when subjects were notified that they are drinking Pepsi. The authors explained
these results by implying that the Coke’s preference was due to cognitive information biasing preference choice.
Purchase choice: Braeutigam et al. (2004) used magneto-encephalogram brain imaging technique (MEG) to identify differences in brain activation between
predictable and unpredictable choices. The authors showed that different brain regions are activated in response to choice predictability, with
unpredictable choices eliciting brain activations in regions associated with silent vocalization and judgment of immediate versus delayed rewards.
Brand advertising: Ioannides et al. (2000) identified the brain areas related to brand advertising stimuli. Young (2002) showed with brain data the role of
advertising in brand development, awareness, and attention, while Rossiter et al. (2001) showed that visual images that created fast brain activation in
the prefrontal cortex spawned strong brand recognition.
Emerging NeuroIS studies
In IS research, there have been some recent attempts to use cognitive neuroscience theories and tools. Moore et al. (2005) and Randolph et al. (2006) used
EEG to study brain-computer interaction for handicapped patients. Dimoka and Davis (2008) identified where the TAM constructs reside in the brain.
Dimoka et al. (2009) found differences in brain activity among women and men when they interacted with recommendation agents whose avatars varied
in their race and gender. Adomavicius et al. (2009) contrasted various combinatorial auctions interfaces by examining the activation in the brain’s
“cognitive overload” areas. Finally, Dimoka (2010) showed that trust and distrust span distinct brain areas using fMRI.
In the IT industry, Microsoft uses EEG for task classification and activity recognition (http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=6609). Similarly, Emotiv
(http://www.emotiv.com) uses EEG-based headsets to observe brain activity of video game users.

functionality of the brain areas that underlie decisionmaking, cognitive, emotional, and social processes.
Figure 1 shows some key brain areas that are activated in response to mental processes.1 The prefrontal
cortex is the anterior (front) part of the brain and is
often associated with cognitive and social processes,
such as problem solving, thinking, calculation, and
goals. The key areas of the prefrontal cortex are the
dorsolateral (upper outer), ventromedial (lower middle), medial (middle), and orbitofrontal (above the
eyes) cortices.
The limbic system consists of the interior parts of
the brain that are often associated with emotional processes and feelings (Lautin 2001). Key limbic areas
include the cingulate cortex, caudate nucleus, nucleus
accumbens, and amygdala. Despite the classic distinction between the prefrontal cortex being associated
with cognition and the limbic system with emotions,
the mechanisms of emotion and cognition are intertwined (Pessoa 2008), and emotional and cognitive
processes often interact extensively (Phelps 2006). For
instance, the prefrontal areas support the cognitive
regulation of emotions (Ochsner et al. 2002). Thus,
the division between the “thinking” and “emotional”
brain might be too simplistic, and understanding cognition does require the study of emotions.

Brain activation is associated with increased blood flow in a brain
area in response to any human activity, such as visual, motor, sensory, or mental processes. Brain activation is measured by functional brain imaging tools such as fMRI that capture changes in
blood supply (hemodynamic response) to brain neurons that need
oxygen to function.

Review of Cognitive Neuroscience Literature
Related to Constructs of Interest to
IS Research
The past decade has witnessed major advances in
decision making, information processing, and behavior resulting from the cross-disciplinary collaborations between brain scientists, psychologists, and
economists. The literature has focused on localizing
the neural correlates of mental processes, and our
review (Online Appendix 1)2 focuses on constructs
that might be relevant to IS researchers. As summarized in Table 3, these mental processes are herein
grouped in four categories (decision making, cognitive, emotional, and social) to reflect the variety
of processes examined in the cognitive neuroscience
literature. This review is not exhaustive, and our
proposed categorization simply aims to capture the
breadth of mental processes that may be of interest to
IS researchers.

can take advantage of the emerging literature on cognitive neuroscience and how to use functional brain
imaging tools to better understand IS phenomena.

Opportunity 1: Localizing Neural Correlates of
IS Constructs
A fundamental task for cognitive neuroscience is to
localize mental processes onto the brain by linking
a mental process into one or more brain areas. Neuroimaging data capture brain activity when a subject performs a mental or behavioral task, thereby
essentially mapping mental processes to specific brain
areas (Figure 1). Because the cognitive neuroscience
literature has already identified the neural correlates
of many mental processes and created maps of the
brain (Table 3), IS researchers can learn about the
functionality of the brain areas associated with IS constructs by localizing their neural correlates and drawing upon knowledge of their functional roles. In other

words, IS researchers can shed light on the nature of
IS constructs by mapping them into brain areas with
existing functional or neurological connotations from
the cognitive neuroscience literature.
While a simple interpretation is a “one-to-one”
mapping between a brain area and a mental process,
there is a more complex “many-to-many” relationship
between brain areas and mental processes. In general,
a certain process might activate more than one brain
area, while a brain area might be activated by more
than one process (Price and Friston 2005). Thus, activation in a brain area does not necessarily entail that
a mental process is involved (a phenomenon called
reverse inference). Some studies, alas, tried to incorrectly imply the existence of a mental process when a

692

Dimoka, Pavlou, and Davis: NeuroIS: The Potential of Cognitive Neuroscience for IS Research

certain brain area was activated (Miller 2008). This is
because reverse inference is “not deductively valid”
(Poldrack 2006, p. 59), even if it can still provide
some information, such as proposing hypotheses in
an exploratory sense and disconfirming theory-driven
hypotheses (e.g., Caccioppo et al. 2008). Since there
is no one-to-one mapping between mental processes
and brain areas, each IS construct could map into
several brain areas that jointly underlie the construct.
Such mapping can shed light on the nature of the IS
construct and whether its neural correlates have specific connotations depending on their exact localization, thus helping guide their conceptualization. For
example, the prefrontal cortex is often associated with
more cognitive processes, while the limbic system is
typically associated with more emotional processes
(Figure 1). Such localization can also shed light on
the dimensionality of IS constructs by inferring which
brain areas are associated with an IS construct. If an IS
construct spans several brain areas with distinct functional attributions, this might imply a set of distinct
dimensions, suggesting a multidimensional nature. In
contrast, if two allegedly distinct IS constructs activate
the exact same brain areas, this might imply a commonality that has not been formally theorized in the
IS literature. Summarizing Opportunity 1, the localization of the neural correlates of IS constructs with
neuroimaging data can shed light on their nature,
conceptualization, and dimensionality.
Opportunity 2: Capturing Hidden Processes with
Brain Imaging Data
Functional brain imaging tools can capture hidden
(unconscious or automatic) processes that cannot be
easily or reliably measured with self-reported data
because subjects might not be able or willing to
express them verbally or behaviorally. Self-reports to
sensitive issues (e.g., ethics) might be subject to social
desirability bias, while responses to automatic or
unconscious processes (e.g., habits) might be difficult
or impossible to measure. Neuroimaging studies can
be designed to trigger unconscious processes, such as
hidden or automatic processes, that are not open to
introspection and self-reporting. For example, Haynes
et al. (2007) identified the neural correlates of hidden intentions in the brain by triggering different
behavioral intentions. Rees et al. (2002) showed that
there are distinct neural correlates for conscious and
unconscious visual stimuli. Studies can use masked
stimuli that are not consciously observed but might
still trigger brain activity. Naccache and Dehaene
(2001) used briefly presented words that subjects
were not consciously aware of (masked semantic
priming), which spawned measurable brain activity. Lau and Passingham (2007) showed activity in
the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in response to

Information Systems Research 22(4), pp. 687–702, © 2011 INFORMS

unconscious priming, challenging the literature that
assumed that conscious priming only activates the
prefrontal cortex. Neuroimaging studies might thus
open many opportunities for IS researchers to examine unconscious, hidden, and automatic constructs
that could not be easily measured before.
Opportunity 3: Complementing Existing
Data Sources with Brain Data
Brain imaging data can complement existing sources
of IS data, especially when extant sources of data are
difficult to obtain, biased, questionable, or potentially
unreliable. For example, self-reported data might suffer
from subjectivity bias, social desirability bias, common
method bias, and demand effects. Mast and Zaltman
(2005) thus posed the question: “But if questionnaires,
verbal reports and interviews all fail to predict behavior,
what other methods are there we could use instead?”
While brain data might be more costly and difficult to
get compared to verbal self-reports, they have some
attractive properties because they are direct and objective and do not suffer from the same biases as selfreported data. For example, research on emotions has
suffered due to the subjectivity involved in reliably measuring emotions with self-reports (LeDoux 2003). In fact,
Dimoka (2010) showed that the emotional (but not the
cognitive) brain areas associated with trust and distrust
to be weakly correlated with their corresponding selfreported measures of trust and distrust. Knutson et al.
(2007) showed the brain measures of preference and
value to predict purchasing activity above and beyond
self-reported measures. Thus, cognitive neuroscience
can help integrate research on emotional and cognitive processes (LeDoux 2003). While we do not question existing sources of IS data, brain data could be a
complementary source of IS data, thereby offering IS
researchers another useful tool in their repository to triangulate across various data sources. According to Yoon
et al. (2009, p. 19), “Researchers should seek convergent
validity by linking fMRI data to other behavioral measures.” Accordingly, we believe that such convergence
would enhance IS research.
Opportunity 4: Identifying Antecedents of
IS Constructs
Brain imaging tools can test whether and how IT
stimuli—such as IT designs, systems, and prototypes—spawn brain activation in areas mapped by
IS constructs. For example, whether an IT artifact
increases a system’s usefulness can be objectively
tested by showing activation in the brain’s utility
areas. For example, IS research has shown a weak link
between intentions to use a system and actual usage
(Straub et al. 1995). Besides, information overload and
cognitive effort (which can be reduced by effective
IT designs) are typically difficult to measure with

Dimoka, Pavlou, and Davis: NeuroIS: The Potential of Cognitive Neuroscience for IS Research
Information Systems Research 22(4), pp. 687–702, © 2011 INFORMS

self-reports (Johnson and Payne 1985). Brain imaging data also require fewer subjects than most studies
because they use replication and produce more data
per subject (Desmond and Glover 2002). Hence, in
cases where only a small set of users can test potential antecedents of IS constructs, brain imaging tools
can be useful complements. Therefore, brain imaging data can offer a complementary means to identify
and test antecedents of IS constructs by measuring
activation in selected brain areas in response to IT
stimuli.
Opportunity 5: Testing Consequences of
IS Constructs
NeuroIS can examine whether brain activations help
predict certain important outcomes, such as decisions
(system adoption) and behaviors (system use). In contrast to self-reports of behavioral intentions that could
be subject to common method bias, brain data represent an objective source of measurement. While there
is not a perfect relationship between brain activity
and behavior because they share a probabilistic relationship, studies have shown that brain data might be
good predictors of behavior compared to self-reports,
by offering different information that helps explain
additional variance not captured by self-reports. For
example, activation in the caudate nucleus predicts
if a person might act cooperatively in the future
(Delgado et al. 2005), and activation in the insular
cortex can predict whether a person might reject an
offer (Sanfey et al. 2003). Dimoka (2010) showed that
brain activations associated with trust and distrust
better predict price premiums than the corresponding self-reported measures of trust and distrust. Thus,
brain data can also be used for prediction, especially
in cases where other measures are weak predictors.
Also, brain data might be a potential alternative for
IS researchers who do not rely on self-reported measures, such as IS economists and design scientists.
Opportunity 6: Inferring Temporal Ordering
Among IS Constructs
Functional brain imaging tools, such as fMRI have
good temporal resolution (< 1 sec) that can determine
the temporal order of brain activations associated
with IS constructs. For example, Cohen et al. (1997)
studied the temporal dynamics of working memory to
show how different brain areas can have both a complementary and a distinct role during memory tasks.
Brass et al. (2005) studied the temporal order of the
prefrontal and parietal cortices to show that the prefrontal cortex precedes parietal activation in cognitive
control processes.
Neuroimaging studies can use a common IT stimulus (to spawn activation in several brain areas),
and they can measure the temporal ordering of the

693

resulting brain activations. Since one of the three
key prerequisites of causality is temporal precedence
(Zheng and Pavlou 2010), brain data can reveal temporal precedence among IS constructs, helping capture their temporal ordering and dynamics and potentially infer causal relationships. Despite the ability to
infer temporal precedence with neuroimaging tools,
it is important to note that brain data are based on
correlation analysis that does not guarantee causality.
However, tools such as transcranial magnetic stimulation that noninvasively suppresses certain brain areas
can help infer causality by showing that a certain
function cannot be undertaken when certain brain
areas are temporarily disrupted (Miller 2008).
Opportunity 7: Challenging IS Assumptions and
Enhancing IS Theories
In terms of theory development, brain imaging data
might question existing IS theories and assumptions
that do not correspond to the brain’s circuitry. For
example, Smith et al. (2002) questioned a well-known
economic assumption about the independence of payoffs and outcomes. Yoon et al. (2006) challenged the
literature that people make semantic judgments about
people and products in the same fashion, by showing
distinct brain activations when subjects make judgments for people and products. Hedgcock and Rao
(2009) extended theory on trade-off aversion by showing that trade-off choice sets are associated with higher
negative emotions. Dimoka (2010) showed that trust
and distrust are independent constructs with clearly
distinct neural correlates, thus refuting theories that
viewed trust and distrust lying along a continuum. In
sum, NeuroIS studies can shed light on whether IS
theories are consistent with the brain’s functionality,
calling for questioning IS assumptions and strengthening of IS theories, helping build superior IS theories
that correspond to the brain’s functionality.3
Application of Research Opportunities to
IS Research
Drawing upon these opportunities, we discuss how
the cognitive neuroscience literature and functional
brain imaging tools can help enhance research on
design science and HCI (Table 4). Other opportunities for NeuroIS research are discussed in Online
Appendix 2. These opportunities capture various levels of analysis, such as the individual (technology
3

We should acknowledge that not all IS theories might be amenable
to brain imaging studies. For example, IS theories at the organizational or strategy level might be less suitable relative to individualor group-level theories. Also, given the constrained fMRI setting,
it might not be possible to examine tasks that require excessive
motor movement. Moreover, given the constraints of fMRI studies
because of cost and time constraints, there might be a limit to the
number of constructs.

Application of NeuroIS Opportunities to Design Science and Human-Computer Interaction

1. Localizing Neural Correlates of Usability: The user’s evaluation of the usability of IT artifacts may be associated with neural correlates in the brain that
could be objectively captured by brain imaging tools. Usability metrics, such as effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction, could be localized in the
brain. Moreover, other success outcomes, such as cognitive overload and situational awareness, could be localized. Since the neural correlates of cognitive
overload have been identified in the cognitive neuroscience literature, Lee et al. (2005) examined the impact of three design features on cognitive workload
when coping with emergency situations in process control systems. Different types of learning can also be localized. For example, the literature focused on
mental and motor learning (Nyberg et al. 2006). Also, McCrickard et al. (2003) introduced a human information processing model for testing the
effectiveness of different notification systems on user interruptions, attention, and goals. Finally, Oulasvirta and Saariluoma (2006) examined the role of
user interface features for coping with task interruptions in various task environments. Having localized the neural correlates of usability and other
measures of system success, the corresponding brain activations can become the means for assessing the performance of IT designs and help guide the
design of future IT systems.
2. Capturing Hidden Processes: Design science and the HCI literature emphasize conscious evaluation of IT designs, and they rarely examine hidden
(e.g., unconscious, automatic, habitual) processes, which may also shape the success of IT designs. Also, emotional processes have largely been outside
the toolkit of HCI researchers and design scientists; brain imaging tools can capture emotional processes, such as affect, interest, and satisfaction, which
have been largely overlooked by design scientists that rely solely on cognitive responses but may help design superior IT systems.
3. Complementing Existing Sources of Data: Brain data can complement traditional usability studies that have relied on task analysis, focus groups, and
surveys/experiments. Many design scientists do not rely on users’ self-reported measures since these measures may be subject to measurement biases,
such as subjectivity or social desirability bias. Brain imaging tools can overcome these limitations of self-reported measurement by enabling a direct and
unbiased measurement of brain activity. Since HCI researchers often rely on behavioral metrics for evaluating IT designs (Minnery and Fine 2009), brain
measures could offer an additional complementary means for assessing IT designs.
4. IT Designs as Antecedents of Usability/System Success: Having found the neural correlates of system success or usability, design scientists can attempt
to develop and test IT artifacts that can spawn activation in these brain areas. Research on HCI is increasingly drawing upon cognitive neuroscience
concepts to evaluate the design of IT artifacts (e.g., algorithms, designs, interfaces, languages) (e.g., Minnery and Fine 2009). Also, functional brain
imaging tools can examine whether IT designs can activate the “usability” brain areas, helping obtain an objective assessment of whether IT designs
facilitate their desired effects. For example, Spink et al. (2002) designed a multitasking model of online information search in the brain to advance the
design of information retrieval tools. Moreover, having identified the brain areas associated with emotional rewards and processes, HCI researchers and
design scientists could test whether IT designs are visually pleasing to users by observing their brain activations.
5. Testing Consequences of IT Artifacts: The brain activations associated with IT artifacts can be tested on their ability to predict favorable consequences,
such as use, productivity, satisfaction, and other user behaviors. Besides, the cognitive neuroscience literature has identified major differences when users
interact with computers versus humans. McCabe et al. (2001) show a significant activation in the brain only when subjects played a cooperative game with
a human, but no activation when engaging with computer. Rilling et al. (2004) showed stronger brain activations when people played against humans than
computers, distinguishing whether a subject played against a human or a computer. Rilling et al. also showed that participants rejected unfair offers from
humans more frequently than from computers, and they cooperated with humans more frequently. These findings can have implications for design
scientists to create “human-like” IT interfaces using brain activations as a measure of a more human-like IT interface.
6. Inferring Temporal Ordering Among Brain Areas: To better understand the design of IT artifacts, it may be useful to examine the timing of brain
activations. For example, if a proposed IT design is claimed to achieve usability by being visually appealing, then brain activations should first be observed
temporally in the brain area associated with visual appeal. The temporal ordering of the brain activations can also test hypotheses about the process by
which IT designs affect various outcomes, such as reducing cognitive effort or achieving aesthetic design.
7. Enhancing Design Science and HCI Theories: The ultimate benefit of brain imaging studies would be to advance methods for developing, refining, and
testing IT artifacts. The ultimate challenge would be to show that brain imaging studies can offer insights beyond what behavioral studies or existing
computational models can offer. Design science and the HCI literature can take advantage of brain imaging tools to advance the design, usability, and
performance of IT artifacts by having a more direct and objective relationship between the human brain and the focal IT artifact.

adoption and use), group (virtual teams), organizational
(information processing), market (e-commerce), and societal (cross-cultural studies) levels. While the respondent in brain imaging studies is always the individual, brain imaging tools are not constrained by
the individual level, but they may extend to other
levels of analysis by relying on “hyper-scanning”
(King-Casas et al. 2005) to simultaneously scan several individuals that are part of a certain group, key
respondents to examine organizational or interorganizational phenomena (e.g., IS managers), consumers
to examine market phenomena, or users from various
cultures to examine cross-cultural differences. This is
equivalent to interviews, experiments, or surveys that
collect data from individuals as key respondents to

make inferences about phenomena at higher levels of
analysis.
We hope that the proposed example opportunities
(Table 4 and Online Appendix 2) serve as a starting
blueprint for IS researchers to explore other areas. For
example, the literature on IT labor can draw upon the
extensive cognitive neuroscience literature on rewards
that has identified the brain areas responsible for the
magnitude (Hsu et al. 2005), predictability (Knutson
et al. 2001), and timing of rewards (McClure et al.
2004a) to devise appropriate compensation schemes
for IT professionals. The IS strategy literature can
also benefit by drawing upon the knowledge of how
people evaluate the magnitude and probability of
gains and losses to examine how IT executives make
IT investments, administer portfolios of IS projects,

and manage the risks of IT projects. For example,
Lo and Repin (2002) examined brain data of 10 professional foreign exchange traders during a simulated
market exercise while managing actual currency contracts of over $1,000,000. Such realistic studies with
real-life participants in various contexts suggest that
the cognitive neuroscience literature and functional
brain imaging tools can shed light on multiple areas
of IS research beyond those proposed in this paper.

Example NeuroIS Study on
Technology Adoption and
Use in E-commerce

A relatively simple NeuroIS example study is presented to illustrate how functional brain imaging tools
(i.e., fMRI) can be used to inform the technology
adoption and use in e-commerce.
4.1.

Experimental Protocol, Data Analysis,
and Results
We experimentally manipulated two websites—a real
commercial website (Website 1) and a fictitious one
(Website 2)—to differ in their functionality (usefulness) and user friendliness (ease of use). Six subjects
(four male and two female) between 20 and 33 years
old (mean = 24) were recruited to participate in the
experiment.
The protocol had three stages (before, during, and
after the fMRI session). First, before the fMRI session,
the subjects were asked to browse each website for 15
minutes, aiming to purchase a certain digital camera.
We manipulated the degree of perceived usefulness and ease of use by varying the number of products, search capabilities, product descriptions, and
customer and expert reviews that describe Website 1
as a high-quality and easy-to-use website and Website 2 as a low quality, difficult-to-use website. Manipulation checks showed Website 1 to be significantly
Figure 2

higher (p < 0001) than Website 2 in terms of perceived
usefulness and ease of use.
During the fMRI session, the stimuli were presented on a computerized digital projection screen
placed in front of the subjects through a mirror system. The subjects were randomly shown one of the
two websites for three seconds, followed by an also
randomly shown measurement item on perceived
usefulness, ease of use, or intentions to purchase.
The measurement items were randomly intermixed
to precisely target the corresponding constructs without causing halo or carry over effects. The website
image aimed at directing the subjects to each website (the IT stimulus), while the measurement items
were used to induce brain activation specifically for
each of the focal constructs. After five seconds, the
subjects were shown the anchors of a 3-point Likerttype scale below the measurement item, and were
asked to select one of them (1 = Disagree; 2 = Neutral;
3 = Agree) by clicking the button of a custom-made
fiberoptic device. After the subjects clicked on their
choice, the next randomly selected website image and
measurement item appeared (Figure 2). Ten measurement items were used based on Davis (1989), adapted
for the study’s e-commerce context (Pavlou 2003) for
each of the three constructs and the two websites for
a total of 60 (3 × 2 × 10) measurement items. Using a
3-Tesla fMRI scanner, brain data for the entire brain
were acquired in a continuous time-series fashion at
5 mm-thick brain slices.
After the fMRI session, subjects were asked to
respond to the exact same measurement items of
the three constructs on a traditional 7-point Likerttype paper format. This step tested whether the subjects’ responses during the fMRI session differed from
their responses in the traditional paper format (Phan
et al. 2004).
The analysis of the fMRI data was performed with
the SPM2 freeware following standard procedures

(Online Appendix 3). To localize the neural correlates of each construct and minimize confounds due
to visual stimuli, hand movement, and other sources
of noise, we contrasted the brain activations for each
construct relative to a control task for each website.
All brain activations were captured when the subjects
were processing each measurement item (before posting their response). For each construct, the resulting
statistical parametric maps display the z-value of each
voxel (3D pixel) (p < 0005 threshold). Then, we correlated each subjects’ level of brain activation (z-scores)
for each construct with the subjects’ responses to each
construct’s self-reported measurement items (during
the fMRI session), aiming to test whether each subject’s level of agreement with the measurement items
for each construct is associated with a higher level of
brain activation.
The results are graphically shown in Figure 3
using a color-coded significance bar and discussed in
Table 5.
4.2.

Implications for Technology Adoption and
Use in E-commerce
The study of the technology adoption and use constructs in the e-commerce context with brain data
illustrates many of the proposed seven opportunities
for the potential of cognitive neuroscience for IS
research.
First, identifying the neural correlates of the TAM
constructs informs their nature and dimensionality.
Perceived usefulness is associated with brain areas
associated with utility (caudate nucleus and anterior
cingulate cortex) and potential for loss (insular corFigure 3

tex). The caudate nucleus is innervated by dopamine
neurons that are activated when one enjoys a large
reward (McClure et al. 2004a), while the anterior cingulate cortex is the “executive” branch of the limbic
system that is activated in the anticipation of rewards
for decision making (Delgado et al. 2005). This implies
that high levels of perceived usefulness may actually be a multidimensional construct with at least two
dimensions, one associated with the magnitude of the
reward and one with the anticipation of the expected
reward. In contrast, the low level of usefulness corresponds to a distinct brain area associated with loss,
implying fear of negative utility. Perceived ease of use
is mapped on the DLPFC, a brain area linked to cognitive effort and working memory. The activation in a
single brain area supports the view of perceived ease
of use in the TAM literature as a unidimensional construct.
Second, this study shows how neuroimaging studies can identify hidden processes that might be difficult to capture with self-reported studies. Perceived
usefulness is associated with brain areas in the limbic system (caudate nucleus, anterior cingulate cortex, insular cortex) that are associated with rewards,
utility, and loss (e.g., Delgado et al. 2005). While usefulness has been viewed as a purely cognitive construct in the literature (Davis 1989), its neural correlates imply links to the “emotional” brain, such as the
anterior cingulate cortex that is considered an “interface” area for integrating emotional tasks with cognitive demands (Phan et al. 2002). This suggests that

Results for Perceived Usefulness, Ease of Use, and Intentions

Perceived usefulness: Perceived usefulness for Website 1 (behavioral data:  = 2092, 3 = Strongly Agree) activated the caudate nucleus (z-value = 1089,
p < 0005) and the anterior cingulate cortex (z-value = 2019, p < 0005). Usefulness for Website 2 ( = 1056, 1 = Strongly Disagree) activated the insular
cortex (z-value = 2093, p < 0001). The caudate nucleus is activated by the magnitude of an anticipated reward (Hsu et al. 2005), while the anterior cingulate
cortex is activated by the anticipation of a reward (Bush et al. 2002). The insular cortex is activated by intense emotions and fear of loss (Wicker et al.
2003). The level of brain activation in the anterior cingulate (r = 00691 p < 00001) and caudate nucleus (r = 00591 p < 00001) was highly correlated with the
self-reported responses to the self-reported measurement items of perceived usefulness for the two websites. The level of brain activation in the insular
cortex was negatively correlated (r = −00571 p < 0001) with the subjects’ self-reported responses to the perceived usefulness items. Finally, the
self-reported responses to the perceived usefulness items during and after the fMRI session are highly correlated (r = 00921 p < 00001).
Perceived ease of use: Perceived ease of use significantly (p < 0005) activated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for both websites. The DLPFC is
associated with cognitive effort (Rypma and D’Esposito 1999), working memory (Braver et al. 1997), and problem solving (Stuss et al. 2000). The level of
DLPFC activation for Website 1 (z-level = 3001, p < 0001) is significantly (p < 0001) higher than that of Website 2 (z-level = 2036, p < 0005), which is
consistent with the self-reported responses for Website 1 ( = 2090) versus Website 2 ( = 2035) (p < 0005). The level of brain activation in the DLPFC was
significantly correlated (r = 00581 p < 0001) with the self-reported responses to the measurement items of perceived ease of use. Furthermore, the
self-reported responses on perceived ease of use during and after the fMRI session were also highly correlated (r = 00901 p < 00001).
Intentions: Intentions to purchase from Website 1 ( = 2098) activated the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) (z-value = 2063, p < 0001), while intentions
to purchase from Website 2 ( = 1003) activated the left putamen (z-value = 1085, p < 0005). The VLPFC relates to intentions (Dove et al. 2008), while the
left putamen is activated when a person realizes an error in her reward prediction (McClure et al. 2003). The self-reported responses during and after the
fMRI session were also highly correlated (r = 00931 p < 00001).

neural correlates of perceived usefulness are not in the
brain’s purely cognitive areas (i.e., prefrontal cortex),
as one might expect based on cognitive instrumental theorizing in the TAM literature. The localization
of intentions in the VLPFC and left putamen could
suggest that behavioral intentions might also have
an emotional element that has been largely ignored
by the intentions literature (e.g., TAM, TRA, TPB). In
contrast to the literature that has focused on the cognitive component of behavioral intentions, this functional brain imaging study implies that intentions
might also have a “hidden” emotional component.
Third, in terms of complementing existing data
sources with brain imaging data, the results show
that the self-reported responses to the TAM constructs
are significantly correlated with the level of brain
activations that are induced by the underlying IT
stimuli (the two manipulated websites that differ in
their functionality and user friendliness). This suggests that the measurement items for the TAM constructs closely correspond to brain activations associated with utility (usefulness), cognitive effort (ease
of use), and cognitive intentions (intentions to purchase), implying the validity of the TAM scales (Davis
1989). These results are consistent with Lieberman
et al. (2009), who posit that it is possible to have very
high brain-behavior correlations. Still, the finding that
distinct areas of the brain are activated for low versus high level of perceived usefulness and intentions
might imply that these two constructs might not
be necessarily linear and continuous. These findings
could challenge the underlying assumption in the IS
literature that the measurement of perceived usefulness and intentions is linear and continuous, implying that brain data might call for new measurement

scales that better correspond to the brain’s functionality, which seems to exhibit potential nonlinearities
and discontinuities.
Fourth, this study shows the possibility of examining antecedents of perceived usefulness and ease
of use. The manipulation of two websites that differ
on their usefulness and ease of use acted as the IT
stimulus to activate the brain areas that are associated with the TAM constructs. These findings could
have implications for identifying additional, less obvious antecedents of the TAM constructs, such as new IT
systems and prototypes. The neural correlates of the
two TAM constructs—usefulness and ease of use—can
test the utility and user friendliness of different IT systems, and they could be particularly useful for design
science and HCI research.
Opportunities 5 and 6 (consequences and temporal order of IS constructs) were not examined in this
study. In terms of challenging the IS literature (Opportunity 7), while usefulness is theorized to correspond
to higher-order executive goals (Davis 1989), there is
no brain activation in the prefrontal cortex that is
responsible for cognitive goal attainment (NewmanNorlund et al. 2007).
Instead, the neural correlates of usefulness point
out the limbic system, a more emotional part of the
brain that is related to rewards and utility. While
the anterior cingulate cortex is the most “executive”
part of the limbic system that is often viewed as
a “hub” that integrates the emotional and cognitive
brain areas, it is interesting to show that usefulness
resides in the limbic system and does not have neural
correlates in the prefrontal cortex. This finding is in
line with the cognitive neuroscience literature that
has established the superordinate role of emotions
for regulating cognitive mechanisms of executive control (e.g., Hsu et al. 2005, Pessoa 2008). Perhaps the

Dimoka, Pavlou, and Davis: NeuroIS: The Potential of Cognitive Neuroscience for IS Research

698

Information Systems Research 22(4), pp. 687–702, © 2011 INFORMS

study’s particular context of website use (versus system use in a classical organizational context) is more
hedonic than utilitarian in nature, and it thus triggers the less cognitive parts of the brain. Moreover,
because using a website for purchasing implies immediate rewards, the perceived usefulness for website
use for purchasing might be related to more emotional brain areas, such as the limbic system (McClure
et al. 2004a). Perhaps system use in classic organizational environments would be associated with less
immediate rewards, and it might activate more cognitive brain areas, such as the lateral prefrontal cortex
(McClure et al. 2004a). While future research is still
needed to examine the neural correlates of perceived
usefulness and intentions in the context of utilitarian
system use in classical organizational environments,
before making solid conclusions about the neural correlates of perceived usefulness and intentions, these
neuroimaging results point out some interesting findings that might challenge the IS literature about the
underlying nature of these two constructs.
Similarly, while ease of use is theorized as a lowerlevel goal in the goal hierarchy (Davis 1989), it is still
linked to the brain’s executive control processing center (DLPFC), which is associated with working memory, problem solving, and executive goals. Besides,
there is no significant activation observed in areas
associated with any emotional (e.g., anger, frustration) or unconscious (e.g., habit, automaticity) processes. These findings might imply that, at least for
the present context, perceived ease of use is a higherorder goal that is conscious and cognitive. While this
study did not examine the temporal dynamics of perceived ease of use and usefulness to draw inferences
about their temporal ordering, given that emotional
processes typically precede cognitive ones (Pessoa
2008), it would be interesting to show whether ease
of use actually precedes usefulness (or vice versa).
In summary, while more studies are needed to
make definite conclusions about the nature, relationships, and role of the TAM constructs, these findings
underscore the potential of NeuroIS to question and
extend IS theories.

General Discussion

5.1. Current Challenges in Cognitive Neuroscience
Despite the proposed potential of cognitive neuroscience for IS research, please note that it is not the
panacea to all IS research problems, and that brain
imaging data are not unequivocally superior to existing IS data. Indeed, there are several challenges and
inherent limitations of brain imaging tools that are
subject of discussion and active research in the cognitive neuroscience literature (e.g., Logothetis 2008,
Miller 2008).

Cost and Accessibility: The most common criticism
of brain imaging tools, particularly fMRI, is their
cost and accessibility. This is because the typical cost
of using an fMRI scanner (including miscellaneous
costs) is about $200 to $500/hour. However, given the
accuracy of brain data, the required number of subjects is small (Desmond and Glover 2002), and 10 to
15 subjects are typically needed for a study. Since one
to two subjects can be scanned in one hour, the total
cost of an fMRI study is manageable. However, as
Camerer et al. (2004) explain, judgment of cost is a
subjective issue that is best answered by the entity
paying for the research relative to its potential value.
In terms of the analysis of imaging data, the standard SPM software is free, and a standard computer
can address most issues of data storage and processing. In terms of accessibility, many universities and
hospitals now have fMRI scanners and other brain
imaging tools that are available for research. Finally,
another limitation is the constrained environment of
the fMRI scanner where subjects have limited movement. This is why it is recommended to replicate
the fMRI study in a traditional setting to compare
the behavioral responses (Yoon et al. 2009). Evidence
suggests that subjects respond similarly within and
outside the fMRI scanner (Dimoka 2010, Phan et al.
2004), as our results also attest, implying external
validity.
Interpretation of Results: There is also active research
on the interpretation of brain imaging results
(Logothetis 2008), particularly in terms of localizing
brain activity in response to mental processes.
First, a naive interpretation is a one-to-one mapping
between a brain area and a mental process; simply
put, there is a many-to-many correspondence between
brain areas and mental processes, and inferring that
activity in a brain area necessitates the existence of a
certain process (termed reverse inference) could be
problematic (Poldrack 2006). Region-of-interest analysis is one mechanism used to address this problem
(Poldrack 2007). Future IS research could explore the
many-to-many correspondence between brain activity
and IS constructs, aiming to develop a taxonomy of
the neural correlates of IS constructs, similar to what
we have in Table 3.
Second, the literature has generally adopted a modular view of brain activity by focusing on localized
blood flows. However, because a mental process is
often associated with several brain areas, the objective is to capture the networked nature of the brain’s
functionality by modeling the pattern of co-activation
among brain networks (e.g., Aron 2008). For example,
diffusion spectrum imaging (Hagmann et al. 2008)
can help examine the interconnectivity and temporal
sequences among brain areas. Moreover, pattern classification methods can identify patterns of brain areas

Dimoka, Pavlou, and Davis: NeuroIS: The Potential of Cognitive Neuroscience for IS Research
Information Systems Research 22(4), pp. 687–702, © 2011 INFORMS

that predict a certain mental process (Kriegeskorte
et al. 2006). Finally, clustering methods were also proposed to identify functionally connected brain areas
(Stanberry et al. 2008). Nonetheless, today’s brain
imaging tools that focus on physical processes associated with blood flow are still far away from fully
capturing all complex phenomena associated with
conscious and unconscious cognition.
Third, each brain imaging tool has its own spatial and temporal resolution that determines its precision and sensitivity; moreover, brain imaging tools
have additional idiosyncrasies, such as PET that
uses radioactive markers. However, the resolution of
these tools is continuously enhanced by advances in
imaging technology. For example, there are currently
9-Tesla fMRI scanners cleared for human use that
promise superb resolution.
Individual Variation and Plasticity: To account for
cortical differences across people, the brain images
must be normalized to a template brain (Online
Appendix 3). Besides structural differences, the
brain’s functionality and organization are similar
across people, and the goal is to derive generalizable
inferences about the aggregate population by modeling various sources of intersubject variability as confounds (Holmes and Friston 1998). Accordingly, while
the analysis of brain data starts at the individual
level and concludes with aggregate results, because
a group-level analysis requires spatial smoothing that
reduces spatial resolution (Price and Friston 2005),
there is active research on modeling and accounting
for intersubject variability (e.g., Mechelli et al. 2002)
to enhance the generalizability of group-level analysis (e.g., Thirion et al. 2007), at least across healthy
subjects.
While brain functionality is similar across normal, right-handed subjects, brain injury might cause
plasticity (reorganization of the brain’s functionality, neural pathways, and organization). This might
result in different functionality across people because
healthy brain areas assume the function of injured
areas (termed degeneracy) (Price and Friston 2005).
Therefore, most studies generalize findings across
healthy—and not injured—subjects.
Manipulation and Ethics: Cognitive neuroscience
and specifically neuromarketing have been attacked
for their alleged potential to manipulate people
in responding to advertising and products. While
brain imaging tools help better understand consumer
behavior, they can only observe brain activity, not
manipulate behavior. Still, brain imaging tools must
be governed by strict guidelines that govern ethical
research (Farah 2002), and IS researchers must always
follow strict rules for ethical research, irrespective of
the tools at their discretion.

699

5.2.

Can We Afford to Treat the Human Brain
as a “Black Box”?
Despite these challenges, we argue that IS researchers
cannot treat the brain as a “black box,” and propose that cognitive neuroscience can enhance IS
research from a descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive
perspective.
Implications for Enhancing the
Descriptive Power of IS Theories
Rich knowledge of the underlying brain activity can
guide theory selection and test competing theories.
For example, if two competing theories on the process by which an IT stimulus (e.g., a trust-building
seal) influences a certain behavior (purchasing) suggest different mediating variables (e.g., trust, risk, or
both), a NeuroIS study can identify which of these
two variables is the most likely mediator based on
brain activations. Since the brain areas related to trust
(caudate nucleus) and risk (nucleus accumbens) have
been identified in the cognitive neuroscience literature, a NeuroIS study can help identify whether the
trust-building seal activates the caudate nucleus or
the nucleus accumbens (or both), plus their level of
activation. In doing so, a NeuroIS study can identify
the most appropriate mediator(s) that maximize the
model’s descriptive power.
Brain imaging tools can help capture variables that
might have been difficult to capture, thus helping
include missing variables and mitigating omitted variable bias. For instance, if a trust-building seal activates
other areas beyond the caudate nucleus or nucleus
accumbens, it might be an indication that other mediators might exist. Also, if a given area of brain activation implies the existence of a given variable, the
cognitive neuroscience literature might help identify
such a variable to enhance a model’s descriptive
power. For example, if a trust-building seal spawns
brain activation in the insular cortex (associated with
fear of loss or ambiguity), this finding might imply
that the subjects either believe that the seal could be
fraudulent or they might be confused about the seal.
In terms of variable selection, brain imaging tools
can also help guide if a variable should exist in
a model; if the expected brain activation associated
with a certain variable is not observed, this variable might be excluded from the model. For example, if a trust-building stimulus does not activate the
nucleus accumbens, risk may be excluded. Furthermore, if there is no caudate nucleus activation, this
could imply that trust is not engendered. However, if
both activations are observed, their timing can shed
light on whether trust precedes risk, implying that the
seal first builds trust, which is then used to reduce
risk perceptions and encourage a trusting behavior.

Dimoka, Pavlou, and Davis: NeuroIS: The Potential of Cognitive Neuroscience for IS Research

While many constructs that could be of interest to
IS research have already been examined in the cognitive neuroscience literature (Table 3), many IS-specific
constructs that have a particular meaning in the IS
literature (e.g., computer self-efficacy, Internet anxiety) would probably require new brain imaging studies to identify their brain localization. In doing so,
IS researchers could start contributing to the rapidly
growing cognitive neuroscience literature by adding
IS constructs to the existing body of existing mental
processes.
Finally, brain imaging tools can help with measurement issues (Bernheim 2008). For example, several
latent variables that cannot be measured objectively
due to measurement biases, such as trust, utility, and
cognitive overload, can be measured more reliably
with brain data, enabling a new wave of IS research.
Implications for Enhancing the Predictive
Power of IS Theories
Since the accurate prediction of behavior is very important for IS research, from a predictive standpoint,
can brain activation better predict behavior than the
underlying IT stimuli? Since brain data are objective and do not suffer from measurement biases, they
might be more reliable and stable predictors than perceptual data (Bernheim 2008). For example, brain data
might be able to better predict the success of an IT
prototype compared to self-reports, plus a smaller
sample size might be enough. Since brain activations
can be quantified with continuous statistical measures
(z-scores), they can be used in predictive regressiontype models, either to compare across various brain
activations to compare brain activations along with
other potential variables. This can test whether the
brain data can better predict human behavior than
existing behavioral predictors.
Implications for Enhancing the Prescriptive/Design
Power of IS Theories
NeuroIS can also help IS researchers design better
IT systems and tools, such as designing useful and
user friendly systems that facilitate adoption, use, and
enhanced productivity. Rather than relying on perceptual evaluations of IT artifacts, the brain areas associated with the desired effects can be used as an
objective dependent variable in which the IT artifacts
will be designed to affect. For example, the areas associated with perceived usefulness (caudate nucleus and
anterior cingulate cortex) and ease of use (DLPFC) can
be used as the basis for designing superior IT systems:
the systems would facilitate technology adoption and
use by enhancing the magnitude and probability of
the utility derived by the system and reducing the
system’s cognitive overload. In e-commerce, the areas
linked to intentions to purchase (e.g., VLPFC) can be

Information Systems Research 22(4), pp. 687–702, © 2011 INFORMS

used as dependent variables for designing superior
websites that aim to encourage consumers to purchase
online. In sum, IS research can rely on brain data to
design IT systems that facilitate favorable behaviors
by people, organizations, and markets.
5.3. Conclusion
Despite the potential of cognitive neuroscience for the
social sciences, IS researchers might choose to ignore
its potential for IS research. However, IS research
has long drawn upon leading reference disciplines
to inform IS phenomena, and ignoring the cognitive
neuroscience discipline IS could be a disservice to the
field. This paper’s basic premise is that the cognitive
neuroscience literature and brain imaging tools can
open up new research directions that could accelerate
our progress toward understanding the increasingly
complex interplay between IT and information processing, decision-making, and behavior by offering a
novel complementary scientific foundation. After all,
a new scientific tool is most useful when it is complemented by existing theories, methodologies, and data
(Caccioppo et al. 2008). We hope that the cognitive
neuroscience literature and brain imaging tools would
trigger a revolution in IS research to fundamentally
strengthen the IS discipline and help spawn novel and
cutting-edge conceptual foundations for enhancing IS
theories. Simply put, it is hard to believe that a better understanding of the brain’s functionality will not
lead to superior IS theories.
