Abstract— In this paper we present a system that uses the
human ability to control a video game on a mobile device
using electroencephalographic (EEG) Mu rhythms. The signals
were obtained using a specially designed electrode cap and
equipment, and sent through a Bluetooth connection to a PC
that processes it in real time. The signal was then mapped onto
two control signals and sent through wireless connection to a
mobile gaming device BreakOut− . We have also investigated
the human’s ability to play the video game by manipulating
neuronal motor cortex activity in the presence of a visual
feedback environment. The participants played the video game
by using their thoughts only with up to 80% accuracy over
controlling the target.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology [1], [2], [3],
[4], [5] is a new and fast evolving field that seeks direct
interaction between the human neural system and machines,
aiming to augment human capabilities by enabling people
(especially disabled) to communicate and control devices by
mere “thinking” or expressing intent.
The increasing success of BCI systems is partially due to
a better understanding of the dynamics of brain oscillations
that generate EEG signals. In the brain, networks of neurons
form feedback loops responsible for the oscillatory activity
recorded in the EEG. Normally the frequency of such oscillations becomes slower with increased synchronization. Sensorimotor activity such as motor movements or motor imagery
(e.g. imagining hand/feet movement) changes the oscillatory
patterns resulting in amplitude suppression (Event Related
Desynchronization - ERD) or amplitude enhancement (Event
Related Synchronization - ERS) on the Rolandic mu rhythm
(7-13 Hz) and the central beta rhythms above 13 Hz.
A second reason for the increased interest in BCI is the
improved resolution and lower cost of recording equipment.
Current research [6], [7] aims at developing systems that use
dry electrodes instead of the cumbersome golden or Ag/AgCl
electrodes, that require gel, glue and skin preparation. This
technology, together with making the devices more mobile,
will allow BCI systems to be viable for gaming. The Emotiv
gaming device [8], recently announced, is believed to use
electrophysiological and physical (a gyroscope) signals for
control. This system has not been described in the academic
literature.

Third, old generation EEG-based BCI had a limited communication capacity and it looked very unlikely to be suitable
for control [4]. Based on signal acquisition methods, BCI can
be categorized by whether it uses non-invasive (e.g. EEG) or
invasive (e.g. intracortical) techniques. Progress on the signal
processing and the classification algorithms has increased the
communication capacity to a point that real applications are
now feasible.
A key to the success of any BCI system is the extraction of
a set of optimum features that reduce the high dimensionality
of a multi-channel EEG signal. These features are then
used to train a classifier that takes the signals features
and produces either a real-valued quantity or a discrete
classification [9]. When many channels are used Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) [10] can decompose the multichannel signal into a reduced number of features that preserve the maximum explained variance. Other techniques
such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [11] and
Maximum Signal Fraction Analysis (SFA) [12] has also
been used in BCI systems. In each technique the resulting
features optimize a different cost function and have different
properties. ICA maximizes the information carried by the
signals and maximum SFA optimizes the signal to noise ratio.
Early evaluation of classification techniques for EEG signals
[13] showed that Tree-based Neural Networks (TBNN) and
tree-based radial basis function networks (TB-RBF) can
classify hypnograms with similar accuracy to clinical experts.
More recently, a taxonomy of the feature extraction and classification techniques used in BCI was documented in [14]. A
251

further review of numerous techniques used for classification
of EEG signals [9] showed that Support Vector Machines as
well as combination of classifiers are particularly efficient
for synchronous BCI. Other studies showed that classifier
performance depends on factors such as, the experimental
set-up, the montage and the user task [15].
One of the difficulties encountered in such reviews is that
it is hard to compare the classifiers unless classifiers are
tested with the same context, feature extraction methods and
experimental protocols. In order to overcome this problem
a number of research groups use BCI frameworks such as
BCI2000 [16] that provide a structured approach for testing
feature selection and classification techniques. Even then the
comparison for online BCI is hard since the computational
requirements become an issue. For this reason most classifiers used in real time scenarios are relatively simple, and are
always run in a computer with a fast CPU, not on mobile
devices.
After the features have been extracted the classification
algorithm generate control signals based on the signal features. These commands may be continuous or discrete. They
should be as independent as possible, for example horizontal
movement should not depend on vertical movement [4].
The success of a classification algorithm is determined by
the appropriateness of its selection of signal features and
much research has been done to determine the most effective
features in the brain signals [17], [18]. These algorithms may
adapt to each user on three levels. First, when a user uses
the BCI for the first time, the algorithm adapts to the user’s
signal features. Second, brain signals may be changed based
on the different factors such as, time of day, hormonal levels,
immediate environment, and illness. To keep the algorithm
adapted to the condition, periodic online adjustments are
needed to reduce the impact of those spontaneous variations.
The third level of adaptation engages the adaptive capabilities
of the brain [19], where the brain modifies or remap the
signal’s features to improve BCI operation [20], [21].
This paper reports on the implementation of a wireless BCI
system used to play a simple game on a mobile device. The
paper is organized so that, Section II throws light on the basic
methodology to conduct BCI for video game experiments
and a brief description of EEG data recording and analysis
necessary to control the video game. Section III describes
the distributed architecture of our BCI-Video game platform.
This paper concludes in section V.
II. E VALUATION
A. Participants
The EEG brain signals data were recorded from four
male subjects at the University of Sydney. The selected
participants were between 20-40 years old with no experience
using the game, and only little experience using BCI systems.
B. EEG Data Recording
Participants were fitted with a head-mounted EEG cap
as shown in Figure 1. Signals were acquired from three

electrode sites C3, C4 & Cz according to the international
10/20 system. A unipolar signal (as shown in Figure 2) was
recorded using the left ear as a reference and the right ear
as the ground. EEG activity was recorded at a sampling rate
of 256 Hz using a bandpass filter of 0.1-100 Hz and an
amplification ranging from 10,000 to 20,000 (depending on
the subject’s baseline mu power).
C. Subject Training to control the Video Game
Participants sat in a comfortable chair with armrests, and
asked to look straight ahead at a computer monitor that displayed a high-resolution BreakOut− video game, as shown in
Figure 1. To familiarize participants with the control scheme
of the video game an initial training period was conducted,

2008 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG'08)

where subjects were asked to explore the game by pressing
the keys on the keyboard to move the BreakOut− paddle
to left or right. At the end of the initial training period,
participants started their control of the BreakOut− game,
subjects were instructed not to touch the keyboard, but to
attempt to move the BreakOut− paddle to the right or left
by imagining right/left hand movement. The participant’s
data were recorded upon the completion of their session.
Muscle artifact were not removed from the signal, so it was
important that the subjects move the least possible. In BCI
applications targeted to locked-in patients muscle artifact
should be removed.
The classification task is done through the linear classifier
included in BCI2000, this classifier does not learn from the
data and does not adapt, as other classifiers do [9], [15]. The
classifier produces a control signal, the cursor is moved on
the screen by a linear function of this control signal. This
approach was evaluated by [22] defining ∆V as the cursor
movement, a defined number of control signals of past trials
is used to compute the mean a, the inverse of the standard
deviation is set as the gain b, and S is the control signal, the
function that we use to determine each cursor movement is
∆V = b (S – a).
Right and left movements were controlled by using a
differential Mu over both brain hemispheres as the bases
for the classification, that is the Mu power difference over
electrode locations C4, C3 (C4 – C3). Figure 2(b) shows
a decrease in power around 10 Hz at C3 during right hand
imagery movement, the bottom figure on other hand shows a
power decrease around the same frequency level at 10 Hz at
C4 during left hand imagery movement. This conforms with
the expected behavior of the Mu rhythmic activity during
hand imagery movement at this frequency level.
III. A D ISTRIBUTED A RCHITECTURE D ESIGN
Distributed applications commonly require the sharing of
computation and storage between their components. In this
project, we have used a distributed architecture for playing
video games with the brain signals. While mobility has been
added by introducing a wireless EEG acquisition machine
and wireless application device, performance is kept the same
as previous BCI solutions. This has been done by keeping the
entire computational intensive tasks (e.g. machine learning
and signal processing) on the stationary base computer like
laptop. Our distributed architecture is illustrated in Figure 3.
A. Bluetooth Connection
The EEG signals are acquired by the Penso system [7] that
allows for wet or dry electrodes to be used (we used wet
electrodes for this study). The Penso recording equipment
is connected to a Tablet PC through a Bluetooth interface.
The BluesenseAD was selected as a Bluetooth [23], [24],
[25], [26] transceiver for its compliance with the safety
standards required in medical applications, it has 8 analog
to digital channels, it is able to sample data at 4000 Hz for a
single active channel to 150 Hz for an 8 activated channels,
and has low power consumption. Bluesense packets have

TABLE I
B LUESENSE AD PACKET S TRUCTURE
Start flagPacket numberCommandPayloadChecksumEnd flag
0xFC
1 byte
2 byte X bytes 2 bytes 0xFD

a similar structure to the AT commands (which are often
used to establish modem connections). Table-I shows the
format of the packet, where Start and End flag determine
the boundary of the packet so there is no limitation in
the length of the packet. Packet number is used to detect
packet loss and each side should pick a separate number
and increase it consecutively. The Command field describes
which command has been sent or received and based on the
command, each side can decide what has to do next. Payload
could be any data such as sampled data or further information
related to the requested command. Checksum is calculated
over the entire packet except the Start Flag, End flag and of
course Checksum field.
After the sampled data is transferred over an established
Bluetooth connection to the tablet PC, BCI2000 is used
for signal processing and classification to produce a control
signal, which is then sent wirelessly to the PDA.
B. Signal Acquisition and Processing
BCI2000 [27] provides a flexible general-purpose platform
that facilitates the evaluation, comparison, and combination
of brain signals, translation algorithms, applications, and
operating protocols. BCI2000 can reduce the time, effort,
and expense of testing new designs and also provide a
standardized data format for offline analysis [16]. As shown
in Figure (3-1), EEG signals were recorded with the BCI2000
as the platform for signal acquisition and processing. Signals
were read into a base-computer that determined the near realtime level of differential mu power and relayed it to a second
computer running the video game as described in the sectionIII-D. The following are the BCI2000’s modules [16] used
towards the video game application:
1) Source Module: The recording system we used [7] has
a Bluetooth transceiver that allows 25 meters of operating
range, a data rate of up to 115,200 bit/s in 8 channels sampled
at 12 bits with a maximum frequency threshold of 4 KHz. We
also used a different version of the same system with a data
acquisition module connected to National Instruments DAQ
card-1200, a different BCI2000 driver was implemented for
this amplifier, both systems had similar performances. The
source module digitizes and stores brain signals and passes
them to the signal processing module. It consists of a data
acquisition and a data storage component. We extended the
module with a driver specific to our Bluetooth device. Data
storage, stores the acquired brain signals in a standardized
data file format.
2) Signal Processing Module: The signal processing module converts the raw signals from the brain into meaningful signals responsible to control an external device or
application. This conversion has two components: feature
extraction and feature translation. Features were derived

from a signal of window length of 0.5s using an autoregressive [28], [29] filter of order (16) which enabled us to
estimate the spectral amplitude values of the signal, 11 bins
of equal size for frequencies between 0 Hz and 31.5 Hz
were obtained. A subset of these evaluations that correspond
to a selected frequency levels then were passed into the
linear classification algorithm; the linear classifier computes
a projection of the high dimensional signal feature space onto
a low dimensional classification space. In other words, each
dimension of the classification space can be represented as a
linear combination of the signal features. The output of the
linear classifier is then normalized with respect to mean and
variance to produce the control signal which is then used to
determine the cursor movement. The filters in BCI2000 [27]
are completely independent, hence, they can be combined or
interchanged without any system alteration.
C. Client/Server Application Module
BCI2000 provides a way to directly communicate with an
external device through UDP. However UDP is not reliable
and does not provide an ease of communication towards
the Real-time Java Mobile applications. In lieu. of that,
a gaming server application has been created using Java
NetBeans IDE 6.0 technology running under the WindowsXP environment on the host HP-Compaq TC 4400 tablet
PC having 1.0 GB of RAM and Intel dual core 1.8 GHz
of processing speed. The NetBeans IDE is an Open-Source
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for software development, which provides all the necessary tools needed to
create professional cross-platform desktop, enterprise, Web
and mobile applications. The client side Java Mobile gaming application ‘Breakout− ’, has been created and can run
dually on desktop PC under SUN-Microsystems’s emulator
environment or on mobile devices such as PDAs and mobile
phones. The client/server application module sent through
254

the performance measure statistics of the participants while
playing the ‘Breakout− ’ using the brain signals, which are
further analyzed in the section-IV of this paper.
1) User Application Module: The user application module
receives control signals from signal processing and uses
them to drive an application. This module is augmented with
connector component which enables BCI2000 to transmit all
the control signals over user defined IP address and UDP
port to the gaming server that manages the game running on
the mobile device.
2) Operator Module: The operator module defines the
system parameters (e.g., the trial length in a specific application or a specific signal processing variable). In addition,
operator can display information (e.g., a text message or a
signal graph) sent to it from any other module. This allows a
user to view real-time information about online events (e.g.,
display of unprocessed brain signals).
D. BreakOut− Video Game
We have adapted the popular BreakOut game to a simpler
version, more appropriate for the BCI task. Bricks have been
removed to reduce the nondeterministic matter of ball landing
point but still it had a kind of strategy and it might result
in failure due to the bouncing ball. In a beginners mode, a
green bar at the bottom has been added to indicate the landing
point of the Ball, so the user should not think about anything
else except moving the bar to the target. In an expert mode
this green bar is eliminated. In Figure 4 the picture of the
new Breakout layout is depicted running within the emulator.
The game was tested using an HTC phone running Windows
Mobile 5, and a HP PDA hx2400.
The output of signal processing module sends device
commands that can be used to control any device. For
this project we developed the Java game as a prototype
application for PDA. The wi-fi has been used as a wireless

be ported on any mobile (PDA) device.

connection between PDA and the Tablet PC. TCP or UDP
can be used as a protocol to exchange data between PDA
and PC. Since some Java-enabled PDAs do not support UDP,
both TCP and UDP have been developed.
The main advantage of this architecture is keeping the
gaming device mobile while having sufficient computational
power for machine learning or classification algorithms. We
substituted wireless connection instead of the wires used to
go from EEG electrodes to computer which has provided
more freedom for EEG cap wearer. This architecture takes
us one step closer to wearable BCI system.
IV. R ESULTS
Table-II shows, the four participant’s statistics, the EEG
control-level across all the participants not varied too widely
over the first 3-4 sessions. Every participant achieved above
random measure of control i.e. (> 50% for everyone with the
max 89% of accuracy): there was no significant change in the
accuracy across all the four sessions. Table-II also indicates
that, for this relatively small number of participants, high
accuracy (> 90%) ususally takes several weeks or months to
develop and that subjects vary greatly in their learning rates.
This is consistent with the hypothesis that subjects learned to
produce diffrent levels of power over each brain-hemisphere
and, thus, produce ‘low’ mu very quickly and were able to
maintain that level of control from the first to the last training
session. One participant was able to maintain a control level
higher than his initial baseline threshold for 77% of the time
during the first training session period. This level of control
improved to 100% on the second and fourth training session
and maintained at 80% for the remainder of the experiment.
V. C ONCLUSIONS
In this study we have developed a distributed framework
for controlling the BreakOut− video game through brain

signals. The participants learn to control their mu rhythms,
especially when this learning involves controlling mu levels
over the sensorimotor cortex in each hemisphere. They are
able to maintain that level of control across 5-6 training
sessions. The distributed architecture of our gaming environment has two positive effects on the whole learning process.
Firstly, the brain data can be transmitted without the ribbon
cable, allowing our participants to sit in a comfortable natural
posture and concentrate on the video game control without
any position specific distractions. Secondly, having data
processed on the PC separate to the video game console gives
low delays in the control signals, whereas the computation
power of signal processing and feature extraction becomes
exponentially higher.
This study has raised a number of open questions for future
work. Firstly the adequacy of number of trials that are needed
to map the brain signals to produce similar versus different
levels of mu across each hemisphere. In a similar way we
could also answer the question of whether or not there are
limits to the level of Mu control that can be produced?
Secondly, do previous experiences such as video games or
sports-manship affect the control levels. Unfortunately, the
sample size presented in this paper was too small to allow
analysis/out of scope of this paper.
The video game environment also plays a vital role in motor learning and control process, hence should be examined
more thoroughly to determine whether better visualization
of the signal could improve training. We are in the process
of developing a 3D-Virtual Reality (VR) environment which
might help people learn to manipulate mu power by using
complex forms of visual feedback. Perhaps instead of a
BreakOut− Video game environment, other 3D VR environments would affect learning differently. Using the control
steering of a 4-dimensional robot on a terrain might allow
subjects to relate better to the task since it would be in a
similar context to an activity they commonly perform-namely
driving a car. Since the robot’s steering is dynamically linked
to the relative output of the participant’s mu rhythms and
is updated in real time, the subject receives the necessary
frequent interactions and feedback for efficient learning.
The distributed nature of our specially designed video
gaming environment may be used to maintain a level of
active engagement, frequent interactions, visually strong
feedback, and connections to real-world contexts in order to
enhance the learning [21], [30]. On the other hand, the lack
of distributiveness in BCI architectures allows only limited
visual richness, in which participants receive simple graphical representation of their mu-rhythm output as feedback.
The robotic-car like scenario, or any VR environment, would
provide an environment that is more interactive, realistic
and motivationally engaging and have enough visual cues
activity, so that the subject can easily get involved and
engaged in the task. This is only achievable through a high
processing distributed architecture like the one proposed in
this study whereas active engagement is missing from the
traditional experiments of mu training and might be a reason
