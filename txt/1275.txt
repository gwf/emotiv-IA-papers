Everyday environmental conditions impact human health. One mechanism underlying this relationship is the
experience of stress. Through systematic review of published literature, we explore how stress has been
measured in real-time non-laboratory studies of stress responses to deliberate exposure to outdoor environments. The types of exposures evaluated in this review include: nature viewing, outdoor walks, outdoor exercise
and gardening. We characterize study design, modalities of stress measurements, and statistical estimates of
eﬀect and signiﬁcance. Heart rate, blood pressure, and self-report measures provide the most convincing
evidence that spending time in outdoor environments, particularly those with green space, may reduce the
experience of stress, and ultimately improve health. More work is needed to understand eﬀects of in situ
modiﬁcations to outdoor environments on residents’ stress response.

1. Introduction
Stress is the body’s physiologic response to real or perceived
external threats which can be in reaction to, or modiﬁed by, environmental exposures (McEwen and Gianaros, 2010; McEwen and Stellar,
1993). The physiologic changes that accompany stress can be protective, preparing the body to respond to danger or hazards (McEwen,
1998) and can lead to adaption over time (McEwen and Gianaros,
2010). When experienced chronically and in the absence of adequate
support and coping mechanisms (McEwen and Gianaros, 2010) however, stress can lead to a wide array of health harms.
Though complex social and economic factors broadly explain the
relationship between neighborhood physical environments and health,
very limited evaluation of biologic and psychological outcomes has
been conducted in real-world settings. It is the goal of this review to
assess the extent of research that has explicitly measured physiological
and psychological stress response to the physical environments in
which people live, work, and play, rather than to laboratory stimuli.
The lack of in situ studies may be due to the complexity of stress as
a physiologic state. The stress response is a product of two interrelated
biologic systems: the sympathetic-adrenomedullary (SAM) system and
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system. These systems work together to achieve allostasis, or the body’s ability to
maintain stability through change (Gunnar and Quevedo, 2007;

⁎

McEwen, 1998). In response to an acute stressor, the SAM system
releases hormones like epinephrine and norepinephrine, leading to
rapid availability of metabolic resources that increase heart rate, blood
ﬂow, as well as ampliﬁed vigilance and focused attention. This is the
“ﬁght-or-ﬂight” response. The experience of acute stress also activates
the HPA system, leading to the release of cortisol, which relates to
glycemic and vascular control.
In research, physiologic stress is measured through markers of SAM
and HPA system activation. Heart rate, a common marker of the SAM
system, changes in response to the neurohormones norepinephrine and
epinephrine. Cortisol, a marker of HPA system activation, exhibits a
diurnal pattern that includes a steep rise after waking, followed by a
drop over the next several hours, and decline until bedtime.
Stress is also commonly represented by an index measure called
allostatic load (AL). AL reﬂects the cumulative, multisystem impact of
repeated stress (Juster et al., 2010; Seeman et al., 2010). AL is
operationalized by combining markers such as norepinephrine, cortisol,
and interleukin-6 with metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes such as
blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol, and glycosylated hemoglobin
(HbA1c), that reﬂect wear and tear on the body over time (Beckie, 2012).
AL may be related to presence or absence of green space or vegetated
land cover in the neighborhood environment (Egorov et al., 2017).
Exposure to chronic stress has been associated with alterations in
stress markers, and in turn, indicators of poor health. For example,

conducting and reporting this systematic review. The primary question
that we addressed is: How is stress measured in real-time nonlaboratory studies of exposures to outdoor environments? To address
this question we searched biomedical and social science databases in
October 2016, including: Web of Science, PubMed, PsychINFO,
Cochrane, and Medline. We did not restrict searches by date of
publication and saved all references using Endnote X7 reference
manager.
We submitted a standard Boolean search phrase, with syntax
tailored to each database. In Web of Science we submitted the following
search phrase: (green space*” OR “greenspace” OR “green exercise” OR
“green landscape*” OR “natural space” OR “sounds of nature” OR
“nature sound*” OR “natural environment*” OR “natural landscape”
OR “urban nature” OR “nearby nature” OR “nature view*” OR “tree
cover” OR “exposure to nature” OR “outdoor nature” OR “natural
space” OR “nature contact” OR “contact with natur*” OR “outdoor
environment*” OR greening OR greenness OR neighborhood OR
neighborhood* OR park OR “vacant lot*” OR gardening OR “urban
environment*” OR “urban forest” OR “urban ﬁeld settings” OR “viewing nature” OR “forest walking” OR “forest environment*” OR shinrin
OR “forest recreation” OR “forest bathing”) AND (stress OR “environmental stressor*” OR “blood pressure” OR neuro* OR endocrine OR
physiologic* OR psychophysiologic* OR allostatic).
We sought to identify studies that measured biologic indicators
linked to the physiologic stress response, as well as self-reported
psychological indicators relating to mood, anxiety, distress, perceived
stress, restoration, cognitive function, and attention. We considered
studies that measured these responses to exposure to any outdoor
environments. While most environments involved parks, nature, green
space, or forest, we did not select these studies exclusively. We included
studies in which stress was the primary outcome of interest. We
therefore did not include studies in which stress was measured and
used as a mediator (covariate) to another health outcome.
Fig. 1 illustrates our study selection process. The initial searches
identiﬁed 10,519 references. The three authors used consensus to
determine study inclusion criteria and speciﬁc inclusion decisions. We
ﬁrst excluded non-human-based studies, and papers not available in
English, leaving 3311 studies. We then removed non-original research
articles such as reviews, and studies that tested stress response to
laboratory stimuli, such as on-screen images, or indoor environments
(3080 remained). We excluded 2973 duplicate records. Each author
then independently reviewed the remaining papers to determine
eligibility. Papers with author disagreement were resolved through
discussion and the development of consensus. Based on this review, we

stress is associated with deviations from the normal cortisol diurnal
pattern (Do et al., 2011; Hajat et al., 2015; Karb et al., 2012; Miller et al.,
2007). These deviations occur more prevalently in deprived neighborhoods (Roe et al., 2013), or among populations with low education or
minority race/ethnicity status (Karlamangla et al., 2013), and have been
linked to negative health outcomes including cardiovascular disease
mortality (Kumari et al., 2011), depression and anxiety disorders (Doane
et al., 2013), type 2 diabetes (Hackett et al., 2014), memory impairment
(Lupien et al., 1998), and immunosuppression (Cacioppo et al., 2002).
Similarly, high AL in adolescents is associated with poor mental health,
increased incidence of asthma, and poor health outcomes later in life
(Bahreinian et al., 2013; Evans et al., 2007; Jackson et al., 2010). Among
elderly populations, AL has been associated with cardiovascular disease,
physical decline, cognitive function and depression (Juster et al., 2010;
Seeman et al., 2001, 1997).
A growing number of studies measure stress and related indicators
as a means to understand the relationship between neighborhood
environments and human health. This line of inquiry is important, as
changes in physiologic stress may be detected prior to the onset of
disease. However, only a subset of these studies measure real time
stress response (using pre- and post-measurement) to physical environment exposure. The relationship between health outcomes and
features of neighborhood environments such as disorder, pedestrian
and other transportation infrastructure, or green space, often uses
residential location as a proxy for exposure. This does not capture the
nuance of exposures that people may experience as they leave their
homes and traverse various time-activity zones throughout the day.
Using a home address as an estimate of exposure to neighborhood
conditions has been shown to bias exposure estimates and calculations
of risk (Culyba et al., 2018).
Real-time measurement may also permit evaluation of the nuances
in stress responses to environmental stimuli. Some markers of stress
exhibit immediate response to external stimuli and there is value in
measuring this short-term response as it occurs, as opposed to occasional measurements in laboratory settings. In addition, only a sample of
these studies measure stress response to actual physical environments,
as opposed to simulated laboratory environments. The purpose of this
review is to systematically review characteristics of studies evaluating the
stress response to physical, or outdoor, environmental exposures.
2. Methods
We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al., 2009) when

et al., 2014), or treatment location (South et al., 2015) was randomized.
Most studies collected data at varying times during the experiment.
For example, physiological measures were often collected before and
after the environment exposure. In some cases measurements were
taken during the exposure, and/or after a period following the
exposure. Thirteen studies conducted continuous monitoring of physiological indicators such as heart rate, heart rate variability, blood
pressure, or emotional experience (Aspinall et al., 2015; Gathright
et al., 2006; Horiuchi et al., 2014; Joung et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2014;
Park et al., 2008; Song et al., 2014, 2015a, 2015b, 2013b; South et al.,
2015; Tsunetsugu et al., 2013, 2007). Ten studies used an accelerometer to record energy expenditure (Lee et al., 2011, 2014; Lee, 2010;
Li et al., 2008; Ochiai et al., 2015; Park et al., 2008, 2009; Song et al.,
2014, 2015a, 2013b).

excluded 64 additional studies that calculated environmental exposures
using spatial databases given participants’ residential addresses rather
than measuring explicit and deliberate exposure to outdoor environments.
From each study we recorded research aims, study design, location,
years, unit(s) of analysis, sample size, population demographics,
environmental exposure, stress outcome(s), measurement procedure
and instruments, inclusion of a stress task, and covariates in statistical
models. In addition, we recorded eﬀect direction and p-value. Many
studies conducted repeated measures of stress indicators in two or
more environments (e.g. treatment and control locations). These
studies reported statistical diﬀerences for stress measures by time,
location, and often time × environment. In this case, we report eﬀect
direction and p-value for diﬀerence comparisons between measurements taken directly before and after experimental (outdoor) exposures, and if available between outdoor environment locations and
control locations.
3. Results

3.2. Environmental exposure settings

Our search identiﬁed 43 papers that met our inclusion criteria
(Table 1).

Studies employed one of four types of environmental exposures:
nature viewing, outdoor walk, outdoor exercise or gardening. Table 1
describes experimental exposure and settings. More than half of the
studies (n = 25) involved an outdoor walk as the mechanism of
environmental exposure (Aspinall et al., 2015; Gidlow et al., 2016;
Gladwell et al., 2016; Grazuleviciene et al., 2016; Hartig et al., 2003,
1991; Hawkins et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2014; Li et al., 2011; Morita
et al., 2011; Ochiai et al., 2015; Ohtsuka et al., 1998; Park et al., 2010,
2009; Roe and Aspinall, 2011; Song et al., 2014, 2015a, 2015b, 2013b;
South et al., 2015; Teas et al., 2007; Toda et al., 2013; Tsunetsugu
et al., 2007; Tyrväinen et al., 2014; Yamaguchi et al., 2006).
Participants were asked to walk a certain distance or amount of time
outside, mostly one time, but in some cases repeated times.
Eleven studies collected measures of stress response to viewing
landscapes (Beil and Hanes, 2013; Horiuchi et al., 2014; Joung et al.,
2015; Kjellgren and Buhrkall, 2010; Lee et al., 2009, 2011; Li et al.,
2008; Matsunaga et al., 2011; Park et al., 2008; Song et al., 2013a;
Tsunetsugu et al., 2013). Nature viewing involved passive exposure to
environments. Participants may have been asked to sit or lie down and
view an outdoor setting in both a built and natural location. The
practice of shinrin-yoku involved nature viewing, though often in
combination with walking. One study (Park et al., 2009) asked
participants to both view landscapes and complete an outdoor walk
on the same day.
Two studies tested the eﬀects of outdoor exercise, included biking
and strength exercises (Calogiuri et al., 2016) and tree climbing
(Gathright et al., 2006) on stress response. The remaining ﬁve studies
involved some form of outdoor gardening (Detweiler et al., 2015; Lee,
2010; Ottosson and Grahn, 2005; Park et al., 2009; Rodiek, 2002; van
den Berg and Custers, 2011).
Seventeen of the studies were conducted in both natural and built
environments, with the natural environment serving as the treatment,
and built or urban environment serving as the control condition (Gidlow
et al., 2016; Gladwell et al., 2016; Grazuleviciene et al., 2016; Hartig
et al., 2003, 1991; Joung et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2009, 2011, 2014; Li
et al., 2011; Park et al., 2008, 2010, 2009; Roe and Aspinall, 2011;
Tsunetsugu et al., 2013; Tyrväinen et al., 2014; Yamaguchi et al., 2006).
Twelve studies were conducted solely in forested or rural settings
(Gathright et al., 2006; Hawkins et al., 2011; Horiuchi et al., 2014; Li
et al., 2008; Morita et al., 2011; Ochiai et al., 2015; Ohtsuka et al., 1998;
Song et al., 2015b, 2013a; Toda et al., 2013; Tsunetsugu et al., 2007; van
den Berg and Custers, 2011). Thirteen studies were conducted in urban
settings, although often in a range of settings from highly built to highly
natural park settings (Aspinall et al., 2015; Beil and Hanes, 2013;

3.1. Location and study design
Twenty-three of the 43 studies (Gathright et al., 2006; Horiuchi
et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2009, 2011, 2014; Li et al., 2008, 2011;
Matsunaga et al., 2011; Morita et al., 2011; Ochiai et al., 2015; Ohtsuka
et al., 1998; Park et al., 2008, 2010, 2009; Song et al., 2014, 2015a,
2015b, 2013a, 2013b; Toda et al., 2013; Tsunetsugu et al., 2013, 2007;
Yamaguchi et al., 2006) were conducted in Japan, including early
studies of physiological response to shinrin-yoku or “forest bathing.”
Seven of the remaining studies were conducted in the US (Beil and
Hanes, 2013; Detweiler et al., 2015; Hartig et al., 2003, 1991; Rodiek,
2002; South et al., 2015; Teas et al., 2007), ﬁve in the UK (Aspinall
et al., 2015; Gidlow et al., 2016; Gladwell et al., 2016; Hawkins et al.,
2011; Roe and Aspinall, 2011), two in South Korea (Joung et al., 2015;
Lee, 2010), two in Sweden (Kjellgren and Buhrkall, 2010; Ottosson and
Grahn, 2005), and one each in Finland (Tyrväinen et al., 2014),
Norway (Calogiuri et al., 2016), Netherlands (van den Berg and
Custers, 2011), and Lithuania (Grazuleviciene et al., 2016).
All studies employed experimental study designs comparing prepost exposure measures (Table 1). Twenty-four studies used a withinsubjects design, in which all participants were exposed to each
treatment condition or environment (Beil and Hanes, 2013;
Gathright et al., 2006; Gidlow et al., 2016; Gladwell et al., 2016;
Hartig et al., 2003; Horiuchi et al., 2014; Joung et al., 2015; Lee et al.,
2011, 2014; Li et al., 2008, 2011; Matsunaga et al., 2011; Ochiai et al.,
2015; Park et al., 2010; Roe and Aspinall, 2011; Song et al., 2014,
2015a, 2015b, 2013a, 2013b; Teas et al., 2007; Toda et al., 2013;
Tsunetsugu et al., 2007; Tyrväinen et al., 2014). Eighteen studies used
a between-subjects study design in which participants were divided in
to groups, for example a treatment and control group, and each group
was exposed to diﬀerent conditions (Aspinall et al., 2015; Calogiuri
et al., 2016; Detweiler et al., 2015; Grazuleviciene et al., 2016; Hartig
et al., 1991; Hawkins et al., 2011; Kjellgren and Buhrkall, 2010; Lee
et al., 2009; Lee, 2010; Morita et al., 2011; Ohtsuka et al., 1998;
Ottosson and Grahn, 2005; Park et al., 2008, 2009; Rodiek, 2002;
Tsunetsugu et al., 2013; van den Berg and Custers, 2011; Yamaguchi
et al., 2006). One study used a comparison group pre-post design
(South et al., 2015).
Twenty-four of the 43 studies included a randomized study
component in which either the sample (Kjellgren and Buhrkall, 2010;
Toda et al., 2013), study group assignment (Calogiuri et al., 2016;
Detweiler et al., 2015; Gladwell et al., 2016; Grazuleviciene et al., 2016;

Anthropometric measurement of CVS
Blood pressure
Amount of pressure in arteries during contraction
(systolic) and relaxation (diastolic) of the heart
Heart rate
Number of times the heart beats per minute
Heart rate variability
Beat-to-beat interval variability of heart rate

3.3. Exposure procedures and timing
The amount of time that participants were exposed to treatment
and/or control environments ranged from 6 min to 4 h 41 min (see
Table 1). Most exposures ranged from 12 to 60 min. In some cases
these exposures were repeated, for example, for 7 consecutive days
(Grazuleviciene et al., 2016), or for 3 weeks (weekdays only) (Detweiler
et al., 2015).

3.4. Stress tasks
The purpose of a stress task is to isolate the eﬀect of treatment by
inducing stress or mental fatigue to obtain a uniform state between
participants before treatment. Four studies induced stress in participants prior to environmental exposures. van den Berg and Custers
(2011) asked participants to complete a Stroop task that tests reaction
time using word-color recognition. This study collected stress measurements before and after the stress task, and after experimental activity.
Hartig et al. (1991) and Hartig et al. (2003) used the Stroop task
followed by a binary classiﬁcation task to induce cognitive fatigue prior
to the environmental exposure. In the case of Hartig et al. (2003), only
half of treatment and control participants completed the Stroop task
prior to environmental exposure. Kjellgren and Buhrkall (2010)
measured stress before and after an induced stress task (Syllogism III), and after exposure to either natural or simulated natural environments.

3.5. Stress measurements
Our review identiﬁed seven modes of stress outcome measurements, including anthropometric measurements of the cardiovascular
system (CVS), saliva, blood, urine, actigraph, electroencephalography,
and self-report. Each mode of measurement involved one or more
stress outcomes, which are deﬁned in Table 2A. The number of times
each stress outcome was employed, listed by modality of measurement
and classiﬁed by physical exposure setting, is shown in Table 2B. We
did not conduct a meta-analysis of study ﬁndings because of the varied
nature of study procedures and reporting of results, and inadequate
number of studies for each stress measurement.

3.5.1. Anthropometric
Thirty-one of the 42 studies included anthropometric measurements of the cardiovascular system, including blood pressure (BP),
heart rate (HR), and heart rate variability (HRV) (Calogiuri et al., 2016;
Gathright et al., 2006; Gidlow et al., 2016; Gladwell et al., 2016;
Grazuleviciene et al., 2016; Hartig et al., 2003, 1991; Hawkins et al.,
2011; Horiuchi et al., 2014; Kjellgren and Buhrkall, 2010; Lee et al.,
2009, 2011, 2014; Lee, 2010; Li et al., 2011; Matsunaga et al., 2011;
Ochiai et al., 2015; Ohtsuka et al., 1998; Ottosson and Grahn, 2005;
Park et al., 2008, 2010, 2009; Song et al., 2014, 2015a, 2015b, 2013a,
2013b; South et al., 2015; Toda et al., 2013; Tsunetsugu et al., 2013,
2007). Twenty-two studies measured BP (Calogiuri et al., 2016;
Gladwell et al., 2016; Grazuleviciene et al., 2016; Hartig et al., 2003,
1991; Hawkins et al., 2011; Horiuchi et al., 2014; Kjellgren and
Buhrkall, 2010; Lee et al., 2009, 2011, 2014; Li et al., 2011; Ochiai
et al., 2015; Ohtsuka et al., 1998; Ottosson and Grahn, 2005; Park
et al., 2008, 2010, 2009; Song et al., 2013a; Toda et al., 2013;
Tsunetsugu et al., 2013, 2007). Most measured resting BP, however
three studies measured BP continuously using ambulatory monitors,
shown in Table 3.

Twenty-three studies monitored HR (Gathright et al., 2006; Gidlow
et al., 2016; Gladwell et al., 2016; Grazuleviciene et al., 2016; Hartig
et al., 1991; Kjellgren and Buhrkall, 2010; Lee et al., 2009, 2011, 2014;
Ochiai et al., 2015; Ohtsuka et al., 1998; Ottosson and Grahn, 2005;
Park et al., 2008, 2010, 2009; Song et al., 2014, 2015a, 2015b, 2013a,
2013b; South et al., 2015; Toda et al., 2013; Tsunetsugu et al., 2013).
Thirteen of these studies took stationary measurement of HR while
participants were seated or resting, before and after exposure
(Grazuleviciene et al., 2016; Hartig et al., 1991; Kjellgren and
Buhrkall, 2010; Lee et al., 2009; Ochiai et al., 2015; Ohtsuka et al.,
1998; Ottosson and Grahn, 2005; Park et al., 2008, 2010, 2009; Song
et al., 2013a; Toda et al., 2013; Tsunetsugu et al., 2007). The remaining
nine studies measured ambulatory HR using the technologies de144

Buhrkall, 2010; Lee et al., 2009, 2011; Ohtsuka et al., 1998; Ottosson
and Grahn, 2005; Park et al., 2010, 2009; Song et al., 2013a; Toda
et al., 2013; Tsunetsugu et al., 2013, 2007). Six studies found no
statistical diﬀerence (Hartig et al., 2003, 1991; Horiuchi et al., 2014;
Lee et al., 2011, 2014; Park et al., 2008), and two studies did not report
diﬀerences (Gladwell et al., 2016; Ochiai et al., 2015). Results from
comparisons of HR were mixed. Fourteen of the 23 studies that
measured HR found that it was signiﬁcantly lower in green environments compared to in control environments using pre-post comparisons (Lee et al., 2009, 2011, 2014; Ochiai et al., 2015; Ohtsuka et al.,
1998; Ottosson and Grahn, 2005; Park et al., 2008, 2010, 2009; Song
et al., 2014, 2015a, 2015b, 2013b; South et al., 2015). The remaining
studies found no diﬀerence (Gladwell et al., 2016; Grazuleviciene et al.,
2016; Hartig et al., 1991; Kjellgren and Buhrkall, 2010; Ohtsuka et al.,
1998; Tsunetsugu et al., 2007), or no comparison was made.
Three of the 17 studies that measured HRV found no statistical
diﬀerence in any HRV indicators (Gidlow et al., 2016; Horiuchi et al.,
2014; Tsunetsugu et al., 2007). Signiﬁcant ﬁndings of HF component
were in a positive direction (Lee et al., 2011, 2014; Lee, 2010;
Matsunaga et al., 2011; Park et al., 2008, 2010, 2009; Song et al.,

scribed in Table 3 (Gathright et al., 2006; Gidlow et al., 2016; Gladwell
et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2011; Song et al., 2014, 2015a, 2015b, 2013b;
South et al., 2015).
Seventeen studies measured HRV (Gathright et al., 2006; Gidlow
et al., 2016; Gladwell et al., 2016; Horiuchi et al., 2014; Lee et al.,
2011, 2014; Lee, 2010; Matsunaga et al., 2011; Park et al., 2008, 2010,
2009; Song et al., 2014, 2015a, 2015b, 2013b; Tsunetsugu et al., 2013,
2007). HRV was measured for its low frequency (LF) component, high
frequency (HF) component, low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF)
ratio, interbeat interval (IBI), RR interval, root mean squared of
successive diﬀerences (rMSSD), standard deviation of normal-tonormal intervals (SDNN), Poincare plot (SD1), and total power (TP).
Thirteen studies monitored HRV continuously during exposure
(Gathright et al., 2006; Gidlow et al., 2016; Gladwell et al., 2016; Lee
et al., 2011, 2014; Park et al., 2008, 2010, 2009; Song et al., 2014,
2015a, 2015b, 2013b; Tsunetsugu et al., 2007). Table 3 shows that
nearly all of these studies used portable ECG monitors.
Fourteen studies found that BP was signiﬁcantly lower in “green”
environments compared to control environments (Calogiuri et al.,
2016; Grazuleviciene et al., 2016; Hawkins et al., 2011; Kjellgren and

M.C. Kondo et al.

signiﬁcant decrease between post-stress task and post-treatment concentrations.
Seven studies measured stress response other than cortisol using
saliva. Four studies measured alpha amylase (Beil and Hanes, 2013;
Horiuchi et al., 2014; Teas et al., 2007; Yamaguchi et al., 2006). None
of the studies found signiﬁcant diﬀerences. Two studies measured
immunoglobulin A (Park et al., 2010; Tsunetsugu et al., 2007). One of
these studies (Park et al., 2010) did not report results and the other
(Tsunetsugu et al., 2007) found no statistical diﬀerence. Toda et al.
(2013) measured chromogranin A and found a signiﬁcant increase.

3.5.3. Blood
Six studies measured stress response using blood markers
(Calogiuri et al., 2016; Horiuchi et al., 2014; Joung et al., 2015; Li
et al., 2008, 2011; Ohtsuka et al., 1998). All but two studies took prepost measurements; Horiuchi et al. (2014) took a single measurement,
and Joung et al. (2015) took continuous measurements.
Joung et al. (2015) was the only study to use a non-invasive
technology to take blood measurements, involving continuous measurement of total hemoglobin during exposure using a NIRS (nearinfrared spectroscopy) tissue oxygenation monitor (PocketNIRS Duo).
They found signiﬁcant negative eﬀect on total Hb.
All others assessed the impact of exposures using a single or series
of blood samples. A single study (Calogiuri et al., 2016) measured
cortisol concentrations in serum. This study found no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences when comparing concentrations after exercise sessions in
outdoor and indoor environments.
Li et al. (2011) measured blood glucose following walking in a
forest versus built urban area and found no diﬀerence. Another study
(Ohtsuka et al., 1998) compared pre-post exposure (to forest walking)
measures of blood glucose and found a signiﬁcant negative diﬀerence.
Three studies compared various measures of hemoglobin in blood
samples. Two studies measured oxygenated hemoglobin from blood
samples (Horiuchi et al., 2014; Joung et al., 2015). Horiuchi et al.
(2014) measured oxygenated hemoglobin following viewing the forest
and viewing a sheet and found a signiﬁcant negative association. Joung
et al. (2015) also found a signiﬁcant negative diﬀerence between
oxygenated hemoglobin concentrations after viewing natural compared
to urban areas. Another study (Ohtsuka et al., 1998) found a signiﬁcant
negative diﬀerence between pre-post measurements of glycated hemoglobin A1c in a sub-sample of participants, with at least one month
between samples.
In addition to glucose, Li et al. (2011) measured total cholesterol,
triglycerides, insulin, Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate (DHEA-S), Nterminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and C-reactive
protein (CRP) and found no diﬀerence in these measures, with the
exception of signiﬁcant increase in DHEA-S. An earlier study (Li et al.,
2008) measured change in NK activity, progesterone and estradiol, and
found signiﬁcant positive diﬀerence in NK activity and progesterone
and no diﬀerence in estradiol.

2014, 2015a, 2015b, 2013b; Tsunetsugu et al., 2013, 2007). Only three
of 11 studies that measured LF component found signiﬁcant (positive)
diﬀerences (Lee et al., 2011; Matsunaga et al., 2011; Park et al., 2008).
Out of the 13 studies that measured LF/HF component, ﬁve studies
found no diﬀerence (Horiuchi et al., 2014; Song et al., 2014, 2015b,
2013b; Tsunetsugu et al., 2007), three found signiﬁcant negative
diﬀerence (Lee et al., 2014; Song et al., 2015b; Tsunetsugu et al.,
2013) and ﬁve found signiﬁcant positive diﬀerence (Lee et al., 2011;
Matsunaga et al., 2011; Park et al., 2008, 2010, 2009).
Studies measuring HRV found no diﬀerence in RR interval (Gidlow
et al., 2016; Gladwell et al., 2016), two studies found no diﬀerence in
SDNN (Gidlow et al., 2016; Lee, 2010) and one found signiﬁcant
positive diﬀerence (Gladwell et al., 2016). Only one study (Gladwell
et al., 2016) used Poincare plot and found signiﬁcant positive diﬀerence. Lee (2010) measured Total Power and found no diﬀerence. Two
studies (Gathright et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2011) measured IBI and both
found signiﬁcant positive diﬀerence.
3.5.2. Saliva
Twenty-ﬁve studies used saliva as a measurement modality.
Eighteen studies measured cortisol concentrations in saliva (Beil and
Hanes, 2013; Calogiuri et al., 2016; Detweiler et al., 2015; Gathright
et al., 2006; Gidlow et al., 2016; Grazuleviciene et al., 2016; Lee et al.,
2009, 2011; Lee, 2010; Ochiai et al., 2015; Park et al., 2008, 2010;
Rodiek, 2002; Teas et al., 2007; Toda et al., 2013; Tsunetsugu et al.,
2007; Tyrväinen et al., 2014; van den Berg and Custers, 2011). None of
the studies measured diurnal cortisol concentration. In general,
cortisol saliva samples were taken before and after outdoor exposures,
though some studies also collected samples during the exposure
(Gathright et al., 2006; van den Berg and Custers, 2011). Saliva
samples were either collected using laboratory-provided swabs or
storage tubes, and sent to laboratories for analysis.
Seven of the 18 studies found no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between pre
and post measurements (Beil and Hanes, 2013; Detweiler et al., 2015;
Gidlow et al., 2016; Grazuleviciene et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2011; Teas
et al., 2007; Tyrväinen et al., 2014). Eleven of the remaining 13 studies
found a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in cortisol concentrations
(Calogiuri et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2009; Lee, 2010; Ochiai et al.,
2015; Park et al., 2008, 2010; Rodiek, 2002; Teas et al., 2007;
Tsunetsugu et al., 2007; van den Berg and Custers, 2011). Kjellgren
and Buhrkall (2010) compared cortisol concentrations before stress
task, after stress task and after treatment exposures, and found a

3.5.4. Urine
Two studies (Li et al., 2008, 2011) measured stress markers in
urine, including adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine. One found a
signiﬁcant decrease in adrenaline and noradrenaline (Li et al., 2008).
The other found no diﬀerence in adrenaline and signiﬁcant decreases
in noradrenaline and dopamine (Li et al., 2011).
3.5.5. Actigraph
Two studies measured sleep quality and quantity using actigraph. Li
et al. (2011) monitored participants’ sleep duration before and after
experimental exposure using an Actiwatch (R) piezo-electric accelerometer. This study found no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in sleep duration in
response to forest or urban/built exposures.
One study (Morita et al., 2011) assessed sleep depth, number of
awakenings, sleep quality, alertness on waking, and diﬃculty falling
146

M.C. Kondo et al.

Other measures used included the Inventory of Personal Reactions
(ZIPERS) to record positive aﬀect, attentiveness, anger/aggression,
fear arousal, and sadness. Two studies (Hartig et al., 2003, 1991) used
ZIPERS in combination with the Overall Happiness Scale in both
studies. In addition, Lee et al. (2014) used the Emotional State Test,
Rodiek (2002) used the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Positive and
Negative Aﬀect Rating Scale, and Teas et al. (2007) used the Positive
Aﬀect Scale in combination with the Negative Aﬀect Scale. Two studies
used an unnamed 13-point scale to measure subjective “comfortableuncomfortable” and “calm-roused” feelings (Park et al., 2010;
Tsunetsugu et al., 2007). Roe and Aspinall (2011) used the
University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology (UWIST)
Mood Adjective Checklist (MACL) to assess mood (including perceived
stress).
In general, studies found statistically signiﬁcant positive eﬀects on
positive emotions and negative eﬀects on negative emotions, though
measures varied and results were not entirely consistent.
Other common aﬀective states measured were anxiety, attention,
restoration, perceived stress, and sleep quality. Two studies measured
anxiety using instruments independent from POMS or PANAS, including the Hospital Anxiety Depress Scale (Lee et al., 2014), and the
Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Rodiek, 2002). Lee et al.
(2014) found a signiﬁcant negative eﬀect of outdoor exposure on
anxiety while Rodiek (2002) found no eﬀect. Four studies measured
perceived stress, each using diﬀerent measures including a one-item,
0–10 rating scale (Beil and Hanes, 2013), the Perceived Stress Scale
(Hawkins et al., 2011), University of Wales Institute of Science and
Technology (UWIST) Mood Adjective Checklist (MACL) (Roe and
Aspinall, 2011) and the Stress-VAS Scale in combination with a “SE
– stress and energy” scale (Kjellgren and Buhrkall, 2010). Three of
these studies found a signiﬁcant negative eﬀect of outdoor exposure on
perceived stress, while one study (Kjellgren and Buhrkall, 2010) found
no eﬀect.
Two studies used the Perceived Restorativeness Scale (Calogiuri
et al., 2016; Tyrväinen et al., 2014), two studies used the Restoration
Outcome Scale (Gidlow et al., 2016; Tyrväinen et al., 2014), while
another study (Hartig et al., 1991) used an instrument developed by
Kaplan and Talbot (1983) to measure restoration in response to
outdoor exposures. All reported signiﬁcant positive inﬂuence of outdoor exposures on restoration. In addition, Morita et al. (2011)
measured sleep quality before and after forest walking using a selfreport survey instrument and found a signiﬁcant positive (improved)
diﬀerence.
In general, improvement in self-report stress measures were paired
with mixed results (including increase, decrease or no diﬀerence
detected) of physiological stress measurements. With exception,
Calogiuri et al. (2016) found improvements in mood and restoration
along with improvements in blood pressure and cortisol measurements; Hawkins et al. (2011) found decrease in both perceived stress
and blood pressure; Joung et al. (2015) found that an improvement in
mood was accompanied by a decrease in total and oxygenated
hemoglobin; and Ochiai et al. (2015) found that improvement in mood
was paired with decrease in heart rate and cortisol concentration.

a questionnaire. In addition, for a subset of participants, this study
assessed actual sleep time, sleep eﬃciency, immobile minutes, and
sleep latency three days prior and two days following experimental
exposure using a wrist actigraph (Actiwatch-64). This study found
signiﬁcant improvements after forest exposures to actual sleep time,
time of immobile sleep, sleep depth, and sleep quality.

3.5.6. Self-report
There were 30 studies of self-report of aﬀective states or cognitive
function relating to changes in stress from environment exposures.
Table 4 shows the self-report scales used in the selected studies, and
number of times each scale was used. Mood was assessed in 25 studies
primarily using two instruments, the Positive and Negative Aﬀect
Schedule (PANAS) (Watson et al., 1988), or the Personal Mood State
Tests (POMS) (McNair et al., 1992). Eleven studies used the POMS
survey (Gathright et al., 2006; Gidlow et al., 2016; Horiuchi et al.,
2014; Joung et al., 2015; Li et al., 2008; Ochiai et al., 2015; Song et al.,
2014, 2015a, 2015b, 2013b; Tsunetsugu et al., 2013). POMS poses 65
questions that identify six mood-states (vitality, depression, tension–
anxiety, anger–hate, fatigue, and confusion) also using a 5-point scale
(deﬁnitely negative to deﬁnitely positive). Three studies
(Grazuleviciene et al., 2016; Tyrväinen et al., 2014; van den Berg and
Custers, 2011) used the PANAS, which asks participants to rate their
current feelings using 10 positive and 10 negative mood words, using a
5-point scale (1 = Very slightly or not at all, 2 = A little, 3 = Moderately,
4 = Quite a bit, 5 = Extremely). Average scores are used to represent
positive or negative mood.

3.5.7. Electroencephalography
Aspinall et al. (2015) was the only study to use mobile electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor emotional experience while participants experienced the study (walking). Whilst participants walked
through diﬀerent urban environmental settings, they wore an Emotiv
EPOC wireless EEG headset, and accompanying software translated
EEG signals in to four emotional states. Positive emotions were
indicators of stress recovery. The study found that participants had
higher meditation levels when walking in an urban park – indicative of
possible stress recovery

post and treatment-control components, sampling of participants from
a variety of socio-demographic backgrounds, and randomization, are
required to improve generalizability of results.
While we did not exclusively seek studies testing stress response to
natural environments, most studies in this review measured the eﬀects
of nature exposure on stress response in general, rather than on the
eﬀects of routine, residential, environments on stress. Less than a
quarter of the studies were conducted solely in urban settings. While
some of these studies tested stress response to built settings, with one
exception the built location was a commercial or transportation setting.
Only one study (South et al., 2015) assessed stress response of
participants in their own residential neighborhood with a population
known to suﬀer health inequalities. Low-resource neighborhood environments could pose risk to health. In addition, it should be noted
that these studies were conducted primarily in the global North, and
studies conducted in a wider range of settings and locations is
warranted.
There are many challenges to use of human health sensors
necessary to monitor real-time stress responses in non-laboratory
environments. This technology is relatively new and has yet to be
extensively and rigorously tested to establish its accuracy and reliability
for health research. These sensors typically produce frequent measurements (e.g. every minute) that generate a large amount of data that is
very time consuming to manage and analyze. It may be challenging for
participants to follow a research protocol that involves wearing a
conspicuous device, ensure the functionality of the device, and/or
incorporate activities or behaviors that require time and eﬀort beyond
regular daily tasks. This could explain, in part, the typically small
sample sizes in the studies that used these devices to capture stress
responses. This could limit the feasibility of running larger experiments, such as randomized controlled trials, that would be necessary to
establish causal mechanisms between outdoor exposure, stress, and
health.
Exposure to stress has been proposed as one of the ways that
environmental and neighborhood conditions “get under the skin” and
lead to poor health and associated health disparities (Baum et al., 1999;
Brenner et al., 2013; Brunner, 1997; Cohen et al., 2007; Diez Roux and
Mair, 2010; Dowd et al., 2009; Evans and Kim, 2013; Hill et al., 2005;
Kristenson et al., 2004; Seeman et al., 2010). Conditions such as blight,
segregation, poor social cohesion, and violence combine with personal
experiences like job insecurity and discrimination to produce a range of
persistent stressors (Bird et al., 2010; Merkin et al., 2009; Schulz et al.,
2012). These cumulative stressors may lead to permanent biologic
changes and the development of illnesses like cardiovascular disease
and diabetes (McEwen and Stellar, 1993; Saban et al., 2014; Seeman
et al., 1997).
Research that increases our understanding of every day exposure
to stress and stressors could lead to interventions that reduce health
disparities (Dowd et al., 2009). A more nuanced and dynamic understanding of ways that low-resource neighborhood environments aﬀect
acute and chronic stress is needed. The studies reviewed have taken a
closer step toward measuring ways that micro-environments relate to
human health, which will improve our ability to identify the nuanced,
and perhaps, dose-response relationship between environmental exposures and stress (Shanahan et al., 2015). Further development of
methodological approaches, for example use of time-activity monitoring across space and time, could help characterize the complex matrix
of social and physical circumstances, both indoors and outdoors, that
contribute to or mitigate stress. Additionally, given the potential
beneﬁts of exposure to natural spaces on stress, interventions paired
with research are needed most in those neighborhoods that lack close
proximity to such spaces.

4. Discussion
Our systematic review found 43 studies of physiological and
psychological stress response to exposure to outdoor environments.
Nearly half of the studies were conducted in Japan, and the rest were
conducted in Europe and the US. All studies employed an experimental
research design and approximately half included a randomized study
design component, however sample sizes for more than half of the
studies were small (< 20).
A variety of methods were used to evaluate stress, the most
common being anthropometric measurements of the CVS and selfreport. Only a few studies used blood, actigraph and EEG as modalities
of stress outcome measurement. These studies had small sample sizes,
and generated mixed results from which no generalizations can be
made.
Studies that used HR, BP and self-report provide the most convincing support for the hypothesis that spending time in outdoor
environments reduces the experience of stress and improves health.
However, within each of these measurement strategies, there were
substantial variations in ﬁndings. For example, some studies of HR
demonstrated that “green” environmental exposures are associated
with HR reduction. Very few studies of HRV, however, garnered
similarly signiﬁcant relationships between lower HRV and outdoor
exposures. As biomarkers, coarser and more sensitive measurements
like HR can have multiple contributory factors. On the other hand,
there is a body of evidence to support the relative speciﬁcity of HRV as
a metric for both exposure to a stressor and the integrated appraisal of
that stressor in light of previous exposures (Thayer et al., 2012).
Cortisol is another example of a biomarker that demonstrates mixed
eﬀects, the interpretation of which is complicated by known individual
variations and lack of evidence for the speciﬁcity of cortisol levels as
measurement of stress to a targeted exposure. While the majority of
studies using salivary cortisol measurements showed signiﬁcant ﬁndings, these results must be interpreted with caution given the lack of
reported relationship to the diurnal pattern of cortisol levels within the
body.
The hypothesis behind many studies that evaluate the relationship
between stress and physical environments is that exposure to the
outdoors, particularly green or natural spaces, can lead to stress
reduction. This, in turn, is hypothesized to carry long-term health
beneﬁts. There are several mechanisms through which this hypothesis
may bear out. For example, exposure to green space has been
associated with attention restoration and cognitive function (Berman
et al., 2008; Kuo, 2001), which may reduce stress. Additionally,
spending time outside may increase social contact, both planned and
unexpected (Maas et al., 2009), which may reduce stress. Finally,
people are often physically active while being outside (Lee and
Maheswaran, 2011), which may reduce stress and improve health.
It should be noted that all the studies in this review primarily
measured markers of acute stress, or immediate physiologic changes
that occurred in response to exposure to the outdoor environment.
None of the studies attempted to measure the diurnal pattern of
cortisol or AL, which are generally accepted to be makers of chronic
stress. AL is comprised of markers from multiple physiologic systems
and many of the studies in this review measured more than one of these
AL markers. It could be that the requirements of measurement do not
lend well to ambulatory monitoring and in situ measurement of stress
response. It is also likely that measurements of chronic stress will not
change based on one short-term exposure to the outdoor environment.
Only about half of the studies we reviewed included any randomization component. Bias could occur due to non-random sampling,
assignment to study groups, order of experimental exposure, or
treatment location. In addition, not all studies collected baseline
measurements prior to environmental exposure, and in this case no
estimate of change in stress induced by the environmental exposure
can be gained. Improvements in study design, such as inclusion of pre-
