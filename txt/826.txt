Abstract
Online shopping environments are becoming more interactive as technology advances. As a
result, it is necessary to explore marketing theories and neuro scientific explanations to why
this is the case. A reviewed approach of consumer engagement to online interactive shopping
environments is considered in this chapter. The online interactive elements of traditional
fashion websites that are considered includes; social media, browsing and videos.
Measurements of consumer engagement are reviewed via marketing consumer engagement
theories (CE) and a cognitive neuroscience technique using an Electroencephalogram (EEG) (A
non-invasive procedure measuring the brain’s electrical activity). ASOS.com, the U.K. top
fashion online pure player, is used as a preliminary research study, the results demonstrate that
engagement is significantly different in social media, video and browsing tasks, browsing for
jackets elicited more engagement. Originality of this research stems from the novel way to look
at engagement and the ability to combine traditional and non-traditional marketing methods
thus addressing emerging fields of the future such as virtual shopping.

Keywords: Online Interactivity, Consumer Engagement, EEG.

1 Introduction
Retail consumers are increasingly browsing and purchasing fashion items online.
Store based retailers have prioritised internet retailing as a growth channel to which
90% of store based retailers in the UK have transactional websites (Euromonitor
2011).In the consumer market of 2015, total online sales of fashion products were
£42.5 billion (Inc VAT) (Mintel 2016a). These consumers tend to shop on a computer
(89%) or smartphone (41%) (Mintel 2016a). A majority of retailers are becoming
internet only specialists with no physical store presence also known as pure-play
internet retailers (Euro Monitor International 2011). A leading UK fashion pureplay
retailer is that of ASOS.com who have brought in a revenue of £7M in 2016 (Statista
2017) and consists of 8 million consumers in over 200 countries (Mintel 2014). In fact
Snap Chat (a user generated social media channel) is being constantly used by ASOS
as they post from it several times per week for young consumers aged 16-24 (Mintel

2016b). Those that use these channels are millennials who are the keenest shoppers in
this generation as most use six or more retailers per year to shop in online and in store
(52%) (Mintel 2016b). This goes to show that “Kids are getting older younger” with
the current technological age in 2017 being generation Z born in the years 1991-2002
(Euromonitor International 2014). With that 70% of these shoppers are females
(Skorupa 2012).
User Generated trends in social media: Twitter, Whatsapp, Facebook, Snapchat,
Instagram and blogs evidences the current succession in web 3.0 (social, semantic,
sentient and mobile web), progression to web 4.0 (integration of intelligent systems)
and an end goal to create a Virtual Reality (VR) metaverse (everything 2D in web 1.0,
2.0 ,3.0 and 4.0 will be streamlined in 3D via VR)(KPMG2017). That being said,
Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality (AR) projects which are forecasted to be used
in the future with £650M worth of hardware sales in 2016, currently have a high
commercial focus on video games (Mintel 2016a, Deloitte Global 2017). A recent
study showed that 58% of digital consumers think that shopping with technology
would be more fun with 30% of the sample forecasting fitting rooms with interactive
mirrors for the future and only 10% forecasting VR shopping for the future (Mintel
2016b). An example of this would be the augmented reality app Pokemon Go which
included Pokestops in retailer New Look likewise North Face used virtual reality for
outdoor activities to promote their outdoor gear (Mintel 2016b). Due to the demand in
consumer expenditure online in particular, consumer testing via biometric methods in
both the online retail and VR domains is necessary as most research currently
assessing consumer behaviour comes from surveys (Klienschmit et al., 2012).
For retailers to keep up with changing demands of the consumer and technology, it is
necessary to investigate what constitutes as an interactive in order to sustain a
competitive advantage. With this in mind the chapter is structured with a mentioning
of online interactive environments with a focus on videos, social media and browsing
content of websites. Once this is reviewed, measuring consumer behaviour to these
interactive environments is considered. Engagement is the behaviour that has been
chosen to be measured due to the strong support in marketing and neuroscience
journals evidenced in sections 3 and 4.Finally in section 5 all of this is put together in
a preliminary study using these three interactive environments (from ASOS.com) and
measuring electrical brain responses to this stimuli. Its further suggested that this
technique can be used in the newly emerging platform of virtual reality shopping.

2 Online Interactivity
2.1 Introduction
As interactive environments have evolved with time, an extended breadth of choice
for the consumer has emerged in the form of desktops, laptops, mobile apps, apple
watches or a combination of all of these which leads to the question, do consumers
want online interactive environments? Only if the interactivity pays off (Steckel et al.,
2005). The fact that we are unable to touch and see physical features of products
online gives us many choices of product to choose from. Having all this of choice is
desirable, but, consumers have limited cognitive resources and may be unable to

process this abundance of information (Habul & Trifts 2000). Therefore, interactive
decision aids can help combat this problem to which consumers can make better
decisions with less effort (Habul & Trifts 2000). Benefits to online interactivity
includes having more access to information, customisation of product and content,
and availability of tools to help the information acquisition process (Steckel et al.,
2005, Haubul & Trifts 2000) and includes four features; reciprocity, responsiveness,
nonverbal information and speed of response (Yoo et al., 2015). Online interactivity is
influenced by web atmospherics constituting to the conscious designing of web
environments to create positive reactions in consumers (Daily 2004, Manganari et al.,
2008) and influences users engagement with the website by expanding their
perceptual bandwidth such as psychological arousal on cognitive functioning
(Kahnerman 1973, Xu & Sundar 2014). Manganari et al.,, 2009) devise an “Online
Store Environment Presentation Framework” in which they split their research into
four components; virtual layout and design, virtual atmospherics, virtual theatrics and
virtual social presence. The rest of this section follows this structure to which virtual
social presence, virtual theatrics and virtual atmospherics are explained corresponding
to relevant theories on the topic. Then multi sensory and virtual reality environments
are reviewed.
2.2 Virtual Social Presence
Virtual social presence is a way that consumers can communicate with friends, family
or the general public when online. Common themes of this include electronic word of
mouth and virtual communities (Manganari et al., 2009). Morandin (2013) makes
sense of virtual communities by expressing it as “A way in which consumers find
meaning in their lives through joint experience with a brand with friends in a brand
community”. Virtual communities enable members to post articles, reviews and
product recommendations with feedback from other members (Gearhart and Zhang
2014). Product recommendations through virtual communities allows the provision of
consumer trust (Hsaio et al., 2010). Websites of “Facebook.com” and “Twitter.com”
provide a free public forum in which users can connect with friends and share
information such as blogs, videos, photos, links and audio files.
Electronic Word of Mouth (e-WOM) includes any positive or negative statement
made by consumers about a product or company which is made available to a mass
community via the internet (Henning-Thurau et al., 2004), taking the form of
discussion forums, text-based comments, video reviews, product reviews and social
networking sites (SNS) (King et al 2014, Yoo et al., 2015). Compared to word of
mouth (WOM), e-WOM takes place in computer mediated environments, whereas
WOM occurs in face-face communication and does not contain this electronic
element (Kin et al., 2014). eWOM systems are very influential, in fact, it is reported
that 61% of consumers check online forums, consumer blogs and other sources for
online customer reviews before they purchase products, simply because consumers
trust consumer produced information (Yoo et al., 2015). However the lack of faceface in e-WOM interaction raises concern in that anonymity encourages unethical
behaviour (Steckel et al 2005, Kiesler and Sproull 1992). Negative comments online
otherwise known as negative word of mouth (NWOM) has a stronger impact on a
consumers judgement, consumers trust and purchase intention compared to a website

with positive comments, in females this effect is higher than males (Zhang et al.,
2014, Yoo et al., 2015).
2.3 Virtual Theatrics
Virtual theatrics is a way in which retailers make their brand look like a ‘theatre’
through the use of images, video’s, graphics and animation (Managari et al., 2008).
Fiore and Kelly (2007) demonstrate how a demo video is striking and engaging
compared to a static image. Visual merchandising incorporates images, music,
products, colour and animation which in turn influences whether or not a customer
will enter a store or a website (Ha et al., 2007).
Pure-play retailers such as ASOS.com have catwalk videos to present their product as
they do not have a physical store presence. However, Kawaf & Tagg (2017) report
that the novelty of catwalk videos is warring off as consumers are wanting content
that is ‘closer to real life’. That being said, mall haul videos (vlogs); short videos
where influential individuals promote fashion products and express opinion is video
content ‘close to real life’. eWOM has become very influential in shaping consumer’s
attitudes and decisions especially from vlogs as it satisfies social and self monitoring
needs (Harnish & Bridges 2016). This demonstrates how videos are becoming a form
of social media.
2.4 Virtual Atmospherics
The term atmospherics is used in academic fields to represent “the design of shopping
environments to provoke emotional effects in the buyer that enhance his purchase
intention” (Kotler, 1973, p. 50). Navigation systems are links on a website that
enables the user to find information through links to other pages, search facilities,
directories or sitemaps. (Nielsen 1996). Webster and Ahuja (2006) demonstrate how
some websites have failed in aiding navigational support as they get disorientated.
Kluge et al., (2013) distinguished differences between a conventional online shopping
homepage design with luxury shopping homepages. According to them, homepages
are important as they are the first point of contact for users to which their initial
impression is formed influencing their decision making process of whether or not to
continue using the website. Luxury homepages differ to that of conventional
homepages as they incorporate financial, functional, individual and social dimensions
all entwined to represent the multi-sensory experience online. Websites that use an
unstructured design, monotonous colours, or messy presentation of products can lead
consumers to feel confused and angry (Koo & Ju 2010, Okonkwo 2010).
2.5 Multi-sensory Shopping Experiences
Fiore and Kelly (2007) implement the use of sound as an atmospheric cue operating
online. They found that larger organisations tend to integrate sound into their websites
as it ignites memory of the interface rather than the visual representation of a physical
store. Gorn et al., (2004) found for each dimension of colour, cool colours tended to
relax consumers more, when an expensive item was presented in front of a cool
background, this increased the likelihood of purchasing the product. Touch in the
context of shopping can be defined as any physical contact between a shopper and a
product. Touching the product enables the consumer to assess the products properties
and the more frequent the touch, the more engaged the consumer is with that product

(Peck and Childers 2003, Zhang et al., 2014).Shopper density refers to the physical
density in a given space (Zhang et al., 2014). Theories on over crowding report that
confined spaces with a high frequency of shoppers tend to provoke a negative
emotional response. The widely accepted idea is that perceived crowding negatively
affects shopping satisfaction as it leads to invasion of personal space (Metha 2013,
Zhang et al., 2014). Wade et al., (2012) suggested that shoppers need room when
shopping to prevent ‘butt brushing’ and to allow them to navigate their way around
the shop freely.
2.6 Virtual Shopping Environments
Augmented, virtual and mixed reality are becoming in demand as the technology
progresses and augmented reality has been researched academically with regards to
consumer engagement (Huang & Huang 2017). In Virtual Reality (VR) and
traditional online shopping, males are more focused on practical characteristics with
rational thinking whereas females are more focused on the entertainment and
emotional catharsis (Zhao et al., 2017).
Virtual avatars which are computer created beings also known as second life can also
be described using virtual liminoid theory which suggests with the use of augmented
reality technology (ARIT), consumers transition from a physical context through to
virtual context via clothes fitting in AR. This state from real to virtual self triggers a
psychological state which promotes the decoration of an avatar and this state is a form
of engagement described as immersion or flow (Huang & Huang 2017, Jung &
Pavlowski 2014). Haptic imagery being a 3D visiotactile stimuli has been used with
AR to stimulate a real sense of touch (Huang & Huang 2017). Neuro-imaging studies
using fMRI scans reveals in real life humans who create versions of themselves in
AR or use virtually created clothes on themselves feel as though that is their real body
in AR otherwise known as a sense of body ownership (Kelley et al., 2002, Kircher et
al., 2000, Turk et al 1991). Thus, the concept of embodied cognition to which a sense
of ‘real to virtual self’ is created of AR online shopping is through the body’s online
experience and self (Zhao et al., 2017).In fact, self related interactive information is a
trigger for the brain area responsible for the perception of self (Bargh 1982, Huang &
Huang 2017).
When comparing interfaces, it was found that a 2D interface enabled consumers to
spend longer searching and engaging with it compared to a 3D interface, as a 2D
interface is highly interactive (Mazursky and Vinitzky 2005). However, one would
think that a 3D interface is more interactive due to novelty. To test this, some
websites are introducing 3D interfaces as a virtual atmospheric cue for consumers.
Wu et al., (2013) Creates a 3D mock shop in virtual reality and found that those who
shopped in a store based on trends of fashion spent more money than those that
shopped in the colour/visual stores. Those who shopped in the colour stores
experienced more pleasure/ purchase intention than those who shopped in the trendlead stores. Immersive 3D store environments are seen to simulate products more
closely than a 2D virtual store environment due to a richer presentation of the product
and a greater level of interactivity (Jiang & Benbasat 2007). However, the threat is
that consumers who are more functional when shopping will perceive vivid
presentation to be less useful as content will be deemed as ambiguous (Hoch &

Deighton 1989). Consumers who shop for fun rather than function are less likely to
discriminate against ambiguous information (Gilovich et al., 2015). Wu et al (2015)
suggest that in a 3D virtual environment retailers shouldn’t focus on designing a
merely functional environment in 3D but a clear environment focusing on lifestyle
rather than merchandise. Virtual shopping tasks have also been performed to help
those with disabilities. Negut et al., (2016) found that stroke patients did not complete
their task efficiently in a virtual shopping task and lacked a cognitive strategy in
planning compared to controls.
2.7 Summary
This section reflects the importance of social media, browsing and videos for online
interactivity. A trend that can be seen is the rise of social media and how it is having
an impact with video content especially as users are increasingly generating their own
content on these sites. As multi-sensory online environments and virtual reality
shopping environments are in their developing stages, it makes sense to incorporate
online interactive elements. Increasing interactivity can also keep customers engaged,
this is discussed in detail below.

3 Engagement
3.1 Introduction
Engagement has been commonly used in psychology, marketing, sociology, political
science, organisational behaviour and education (Goodman 2012, Csikszentmihalyi
1997, Achterberg et al., 2003, Resnick 2001, Saks 2006). The definition of
engagement seems to vary to different academics, some focus on the psychological
aspects of engagement whilst others stress a behavioural focus. Brodie et al., (2011, p.
260) define this as a “psychological state which occurs by virtue of interactive, cocreative experiences with a focal agent (brand)...ultimately leading to loyalty”
(Dessart et al., 2016, Brodie et al., 2011). Brodie et al (2011) in their working
definition suggests that consumer engagement is a multi-dimensional concept
consisting of cognitive, behavioural and emotional dimensions. In neuroscience,
Berka et al (2007) suggests that engagement reflects information gathering, visual
attention and attention allocation. Other scholars characterise user engagement as a
subset of ‘flow’ (mentioned in more detail below) but in a more passive state, as user
control, attention, curiosity and intrinsic interest is absent in this construct (Chapman
et al., 1999).
In contrast to these common factors contributing to what engagement is, some
definitions neglect the importance of motivation. Burns & Fairclough (2015) define
engagement as a psychological state in which intrinsic motivation causes selective
attention at a psychological level, engagement has been operationalised through
indicators of attentional and emotional processes, often overlooking motivational
factors (Arapakis et al., 2014). In marketing, there are varying definitions to consumer
engagement, however, these definitions are focused mainly on brand relationship
rather than focus on the consumer (Mollen & Wilson 2010, Hollebeek et al., 2011,
Brodie et al., 2013). Also, little attention is given to consumer engagement as a
psychological, cognitive and interactive component to consumer behaviour (Bowden

et al., 2009, Brodie et al., 2013, Patterson et al., 2013). This section describes
marketing theories of consumer engagement, categorising them into cognitive,
emotional and behavioural components. Engagement is then displayed and
categorised into other forms such as involvement, flow, participation etc.
3.2 Measuring engagement via CE theory
The origins of CE stems was discovered three decades ago in Norway (Gronroos
2010, Gummesson 1994). Since then, recent developments of CE were rooted in
“service-dominant (S-D) logic” which views CE in the light of relationship marketing
(RM) to create, sustain and enhance close relationships with their consumers (Mende
et al., 2013, Vargo & Lusch 2004, Vargo & Lusch 2008). The actual term of
“consumer/customer engagement” only transpired in the academic marketing in the
last 5 years (Brodie et al., 2011).This section focuses on CE as a multi-dimensional
concept. Where the majority of research scholars lends focus to CE as unidimensional either focusing on emotion (Catteeuw et al., (2007), Roberts &
Davenport (2002), cognition (Blumenfield & Meece 1988, Guthrie & Cox 2001) and
behavioural (Balsano 2005, Saczynski et al., 2006) as constructs existing on their own
only a handful of studies view emotional, cognitive and behavioural aspects of
engagement occurring together, being multi-dimensional (Brodie et al., 2011, Macey
& Sneider 2008).
Figure 1 is adapted from Hollebeek et al., (2014) which visually depicts from their
framework the multi-faceted nature of consumer engagement. Here we have just
drawn out the cognitive, emotional and behavioural aspects of this.

CE is suggested to extend beyond ‘involvement’ in that is not just the ‘mere existence
of cognition’ is more interactive, experiential and adds value to the consumer
(Brodie et al., 2011).Flow can be described as intrinsic enjoyment, loss of selfconsciousness and complete absorption to which an individual becomes extremely
engrossed towards shopping online (Csikszentmihalyi 1988, Higgins 2006). Novak &
Hoffman (2003) found that increased flow creates greater expectations with future
computer technology. Telepresence which is a milder version of flow to which the
real and virtual world become blended is reported to be shaped by the media
advertisements or videos (Javornik 2016). The concept of flow, overlaps with fluency
theory in that although both involve low effort and high involvement,, fluency
contains ease of processing information or remembering something, which in turn
puts the ‘mind at ease’ (Higgins 2006, Winkielman & Cacioppo, 2001). Immersion as
an engagement concept is now applied to the virtual world related to sensory
experiences such as increasing screen size, sound quality, graphical fidelity or 3D
screen capabilities.O’ Brien & Toms (2010) developed a scale to measure user
engagement. In this scale there were ten attributes of engagement with some of the
key attributes being aesthetics, focused attention, challenge, control, feedback,
motivation, novelty and perceived time. Out of all of these outcome measures,
focused attention was the highest attribute involved in engagement accounting for
29.73% of the sample.

(Zaichowsky 1985) and flow (Csikzentmihalyi 1988) are the most reported subsets of
engagement in marketing literature to date.
3.3 Summary
CE theories demonstrate that a multi dimensional approach to engagement,
encompassing all cognitive, behavioural and emotional concepts provide a strong base
of what engagement is rather than defining engagement as one-dimensional. From
marketing literature, engagement has many forms and the most reported form is that
of flow and involvement. However, these forms are not exhaustive, other forms such
as telepresence or absorption are also an example of how complex engagement can
be. Most of these forms of engagement were measured using likert or semantic
differential scales on surveys. The section below looks at how engagement can be
measured in the brain.

4 EEG Engagement
4.1 Introduction
This section flows differently to the above in that engagement theories are reviewed
from neuroscientific and electrical engineering literature rather than just marketing
literature. This paves way for a comparison of engagement from two different fields.
Self-report measures of engagement rely on subject’s awareness of their own mental
processes which are often distorted by cognitive bias’s such as demand characteristics
or social desirability bias (Fedricks et al., 2004).Likewise other biometric tools such
as heart rate variability or galvanic skin responses are more suited to measuring
behaviour such as emotion or arousal rather than engagement, concluding EEG to be
a sufficient tool to measure engagement.This section is divided up in looking at the
parts of the brain associated with engagement rather than just defining engagement.
Then studies looking specifically into engagement areas of the brain closely related to
shopping or media is reported. It must be noted that limited neuroscientific literature
report findings with engagement and online interactivity, this is where our novelty of
the preliminary study in section 5 comes in.
4.1.1
Anatomical Explanations of Engagement in the brain
Engagement occurs mainly in the front of the brain otherwise known as the prefrontal
cortex. The prefrontal cortex is believed to play a role in affective behaviour and
judgement, lesions to this area result in impairment of executive functions such as
decision making, organisation and planning (Afifi & Bergman 2005). Neuro-imaging
studies have shown higher engagement level processes to be associated in the frontal
part of the brain involved in emotion and cognition and the temporal part of the brain
involved in accessing memories with the general consensus being, the more engaged a
consumer is, the more likely they are to draw from memories (Fugate 2007).
Davidson’s model of motivation proposes that the brain is divided into both the
approach (left side of brain) and withdrawal (right side of brain) (Davidson 1998).
The levels of FAA (Frontal Alpha Asymmetry) is considered as a consistent index of
approach activation (Engel & Fries 2010, Schmeichel et al., 2010). FAA is merely the
difference of cortical activation of the alpha band (8-10 Hz) frequency band emitted

from the brain in the frontal cortex between the left and right hemispheres of the brain
(Briesemeister et al., 2013). Traditionally emotion is the common way of measuring
consumer behaviour using the emotional valence system, however the FAA proves
that information processing also a motivational component of engagement can be
measured instead (Arapakis et al., 2017). As well as approach behaviours there are
also withdrawal/avoidance behaviours (Davidson 1998).
With emotion recognition in the brain, a negative scenario would expect a negative
emotion/ negative result. However, in the context of information interaction, people
who consume both positive or negative information could be equally as engaged but
engaged in a negative way (Arapakis et al., 2017). This therefore leads researchers to
conclude that future research on user engagement should apply to an
approach/avoidance model of motivation rather than the more commonly used bifactoral model of emotions (Arapakis et al., 2017). The brain default network lends
support for activation when participants are not focused in tasks demanding attention
which can constitute to disengagement or mind wandering/boredom (Greicius et al.,
2003). A study looking at neural engagement during social approach motivation
provides evidence in the brain via fMRI scanning to approach-avoidance paradigms
connected towards a motivational component for engagement (Wu et al., 2015). The
nucleus accubens (NAcc) is a key node in the brain related to reward processing and
this triggers approach behaviour (Knutson & Cooper 2005). The behavioural
activation system (BAS) in the brain is an area that generates positive affect resulting
in approach behaviour (Kennis et al., 2013, Wu et al., 2015).

The above image (Fig 2.) summarises from the relevant literature cited above which
parts of the brain is associated with engagement. From the diagram it is clear that
mainly the front and back part of the brain is activated when looking at interactive
media.
4.1.2

Measuring Engagement with EEG

An EEG is a technique for recording and analysing electrical activity of the brain. In
order to record signals adequately, electrodes are placed in pairs on the scalp to which
each pair transmits a signal to of of several recording channels of the EEG. The signal
has a difference in voltage between the pair. The rhythmic fluctuation of this potential

difference is depicted as oscillations on a line graph (Fine 2008). These oscillations
measures frequencies of electrical currents to which are represented by waves and
their length each given the name of a Greek letter (Casson et al. 2010, Cohen 2014).
• Delta: Activity at less than 4 Hz.
• Theta: Activity between 4 and 8 Hz.
• Alpha: Activity between 8 and 13 Hz.
• Beta: Activity between 13 and 30 Hz.
• Gamma: Activity over 30 Hz.
Electrode positions are determined using 10–20 system which are named distances
between electrodes (Casson 2010).
Measuring consumer engagement through self-reported measures or through
observation doesn’t facilitate the focus of a shorter temporal scope in real time to
track an engaged task through physiological metrics. Self-report measures rely on
subject’s awareness of their own mental processes which are often distorted by
cognitive bias’s such as demand characteristics or social desirability bias (Fedricks et
al., 2004).Thus objectively Measuring engagement with EEG provides the insight into
cognitive/emotional processes (Martinez- Penaranda et al., 2013). Measuring
computer-mediated media (such as watching videos on YouTube), is more passive
and therefore suggested to be measured via electrophysiological techniques (Arapakis
et al 2017).Previous studies measuring engagement via EEG with passive media (TV
adverts, social media channels etc.) have limited operationalisation of user
engagement. For example, audiovisual media providing sensory information through
images and sounds can also have physical attributes such as homepage visuals,
attractive characters etc. that elicits automatic and emotional responses that is rarely
measured (IIlan et al., 2004).
A study measuring mental workload in online shopping comparing Augmented
Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) found that males have a higher mental
workload for expensive products in VR than females (Zhao et al., 2017). Studies of
left-brain activity demonstrates how complete absorption when shopping online even
with limitations of online interfaces, consumers are so intrinsically involved with this
experience that they do not seem to care about external factors around them
(Demangeot & Broderick 2007). The term engagement can also represent the
eagerness to fulfil a goal (Parsons et al., 2015). However, little research has been
conducted using an EEG for consumer engagement and brain behaviour relationships
(Fugate 2007). Neuro-imaging studies have shown higher engagement level processes
to be associated in the frontal part of the brain involved in emotion and cognition and
the temporal part of the brain involved in accessing memories with the general
consensus being, the more engaged a consumer is, the more likely they are to draw
from memories (Fugate 2007). Few studies, although not wholly grounded in
marketing theory, have investigated the positive relationships with consumer
engagement concepts such as flow, novelty and enjoyment using an EEG (Wang and
Hsu 2014, Leger et al., 2014, Yilmaz et al., 2014).An EEG study exemplifying the
importance of a two-way interaction between biology and our social environment,
with mind as a concept for understanding the bidirectional influence between brain
and behaviour (Howard-Jones et al., 2015). There is a body of research that examines

EEG responses to like/dislike analysis without considering a holistic perspective of
consumer behaviour (Yilmaz et al. 2014) One study looks at high emotional value and
low emotional value of luxury products when alone and then when in a group. Using
emotion and attention (Pozharliev et al., 2015). Explained above in section 2 was the
importance of a multidimensional view to engagement, incorporating emotion,
cognition and behavioural aspects (Brodie et al., 2011). Romano’s pyramid of
engagement complements this by providing a physiological explanation for this.
Attention is used first to choose important information, eliminating unnecessary
stimuli. Emotion then produces physiological changes in the body such as changes in
heart rate, respiration, muscle tone and temperature. Then action regulator occurs
before an action takes place and attends to automatic mechanisms deciding what to
store into memory and transform into actions, this all happens the frontal lobe
(Romano 2013). Too much or too little information of causes boredom and
disengagement and in turn avoidance (Parsons et al., 2015). Below is a table

The table above displays a detailed review of engagement and how they are measured
with an EEG. Engagement is measured on different locations of the brain with
corresponding algorithms. For instance, Pope et al., (1995) looks at the temporal,
frontal and occipital lobes and measures engagement using the algorithm Beta/ (Alpha
+ Theta). Mcmahan (2015), Pope et al., (1995) Freeman et al., (1999) and Rabbi et al.,
(2012) commonly use the algorithm Beta/ (Alpha + Theta) to measure engagement
which demonstrates a good chance of reliability if using these in future work. From
the the table above, Mc Mahan (2015), Pope et al., (1995) and Arapakis et al., (2017).
are the most suited papers of measuring engagement to via EEG for our study. The
reason for this is due to the study using media to measure engagement are very
closely matched to the CE engagement constructs stated above in section 3. However
between these three studies different measurements are obtained thus a careful
decision needs to be made when choosing an algorithm to measure engagement.
4.2 Summary
This section concludes EEG engagement measurement. In section 3, CE engagement
was measured using scales on surveys, with EEG, engagement is measured using
algorithms at different sites on the head. Section 3 reported flow and involvement to
be popular forms of engagement whereas this section demonstrates how the front and
back part of the brain with algorithm Beta/ (Alpha + Theta) is popular when
measuring engagement in the brain.

5 Preliminary Study
5.1 Introduction
Adding all of the information from sections 1,3 and 4 constitutes to a design and a
few results of a preliminary study. The main aim is to explore the impact of consumer
engagement on interactive features in online fashion shopping environments (Social
media, browsing and video’s) measuring brain responses. The study has been
designed to collect responses with female millennial consumers only 10 initial
participants were analysed. Purposive sampling was used involving participants that
are available to the researcher (Bryman 2011). Female fashion consumers who shop
online were be investigated (Mintel 2014). ASOS.com was the website under
investigation.
The study involved the participant visiting ASOS Instagram, looking at images only,
interacting in likes, follows and sharing. Then the participant searches for a ‘Jacket’
via ASOS website. Finally the participant watches the catwalk video of their preferred
jacket. The idea is to see out of the three levels of interactivity, which engages a
consumer, the most or at which level of engagement (See Fig 1).

Fig 4 Experiment setup
The experiment measured 12 sites of engagement on the scalp. See fig 4.
A high quality EEG traditionally used for medical conditions is used due to its high
quality data signals. The device is called the actiCHamp housing up to 160 channels
and has the highest sampling frequency of 100KHz. Oscillatory patterns of activity in
the EEG range from and widths (alpha, beta, theta, delta and gamma) (Ohme &
Matukin 2012). Engagement algorithms Beta / Alpha + Theta on all locations,
Theta/Alpha on frontal midline and parietal and Theta on frontal locations measured
engagement in the brain.
5.2 Findings
Pilots consisted of 10 EEG results. EEG analysis was conducted in MatLab and twoway ANOVA was generated as a parametric test to see a difference between the 3
stimuli (social media, browsing and videos: Instagram and Youtube).

Fig. 5. Initial findings of 10 participants
ANOVA provides a statistical test of whether or not the means of several groups are
equal, and therefore generalizes the t-test to more than two groups. ANOVAs are
useful for comparing (testing) three or more means (groups or variables)
for statistical significance. A significant result was found between catwalk and
browsing. The ANOVA reveals higher engagement for browsing than watching the
vide catwalk at real time. (Lower level of theta activity proves to be a higher level of
engagement). However, there are many factors to consider as only first 10
participants were used so it is not a significant sample size. Also focusing on one
retailer (ASOS.com) doesn’t mean each level of interactivity is engaging or not
engaging.
5.3 Summary
The preliminary study is very basic and is mentioned to demonstrate how online
interactivity can be measured from the engagement concepts that are reported above.
Although results are by no means conclusive, it does show that EEG engagement can
be measured providing significant results when looking at different interactivity
online.

Conclusion

From the literature presented above, three levels of interactivity virtual social
presence, virtual theatrics and virtual atmospherics prove to be relevant in today’s
generation and therefore useful in measuring consumer responses. Engagement has
been looked at by two perspectives, marketing and neuroscience which hasn’t been
viewed in this way before. It can be seen that engagement is difficult to measure for
both disciplines. The review provides evidence that there are techniques that enable
engagement to be measured in marketing via surveys using likert and semantic
differential scales. In neuroscience engagement can be measured by looking at the
front and back of the brain and algorithms using electrical bandwidths alpha, beta
and theta can be used. The preliminary study proved that the concept using EEG for
measuring engagement to online interactive aspects of ASOS worked and a
significant difference between browsing and catwalks was found. Fashion retailers
are actively searching for the latest technology innovations that can improve the
shopping experience. John Lewis for example is using a company called JLAB to use
Instagram as a social checkout by allowing consumers to buy products through its
Instagram feed (Mintel 2016b). This shows how pivitol social media, browsing and
videos are when it comes to future technological developments for retail. In the case

of AR and VR shopping environments for the future, It is likely that more pure-play
retailers will utilise real world retail spaces to support their virtual stores
(Euromonitor International 2011). VR shopping environments at this stage are only
in their developing stages, thus the need for a VR retail environment is a
consideration for the future. “The biggest challenge is not only how expensive it is to
produce content but how difficult it is to produce truly engaging content. There’s a
big learning curve” (Euromonitor 2016).
