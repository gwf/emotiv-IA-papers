Abstract—This study proposes the use of radial visual stimuli
design to obtain increased steady state visual evoked potential
(SSVEP) responses that can be utilised in brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Visual stimuli designs based on chip on board
(COB) LEDs were used in this study to compare the influences
of the radial with horizontal and concentric patterns in SSVEP.
Circular rings with diameters 70 mm, 90 mm, 110 mm, and 130
mm with green COB LEDs were used for radial and concentric
patterns while green strip COB LED of 18 mm width and length
16 cm was used for horizontal pattern. The visual flicker and
the concentric patterns were generated and controlled precisely
by a 32-bit microcontroller platform. The SSVEP frequencies
used were 7, 8, 9 and 10 Hz for a period of 30 seconds for
each horizontal, radial and concentric circle visual stimulus.
The study analysed the EEG recording from five participants
comprising of five trials from each frequency and three different
stimuli designs to identify the most responsive visual stimulus for
evoking SSVEP. Furthermore, we also compared the influence of
ring diameters in radial visual stimulus to identify the maximal
response and minimal visual fatigue. The results indicated that
radial stimulus gave significantly better response than concentric
circles or horizontal stimuli for all the participants. Also 130 mm
radial stimulus gave the highest response and viewing comfort.

sensors placed at various positions around the head based on
the requirement of the study or application. BCI applications
are generally developed using EEG signals based on P300
potential or steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) as
these give higher success rates. However motor imagery based
BCI is yet another possible approach [9]–[12].
Figure 1 shows an example of EEG data acquisition,
wireless data transfer and data processing in a BCI based
application control system. The data can be recorded using
wireless Emotiv EPOC+, which wirelessly transmits the data
to the computer using proprietary protocol with real time
monitoring of packet loss and connection quality. The raw
EEG recordings are processed and classified for controlling
external applications or other non-muscular communication
systems.
In this paper, radial stimulus were studied along with
horizontal and concentric designs for SSVEP based BCI
application with the aim of increasing the response. SSVEP
is a repetitive sinusoidal like signal generated in the brain
when the user focuses on a flickering light which flashes
continuously at a constant frequency [10], [11], [13]–[15].

RAIN waves recorded from the scalp using non-invasive
methods with electroencephalography (EEG) is a standard tool used in various mental health related diagnosis
[1]–[3]. It is also becoming a more popular method in
multi-disciplinary studies combining neuroscience, psychology, computer science and engineering for various applications
[4], [5]. EEG based brain-computer interface (BCI) is a type of
human-machine communication system utilising brain signals
to control external applications or devices. BCI research is
widely explored in recent decades and such technologies
can assist people with disabilities to provide communication
capabilities to relay their intentions to external world through
a non-muscular medium [5]–[8].
EEG based BCI is popular due its low cost, portability
and high temporal resolution. The data is collected using

Fig. 1. Basic BCI control system

SSVEP can be evoked using a visual stimulus based on
programmed flashes on LCD screen or using LEDs, flashing
with precise frequency as per requirement. SSVEP based
BCI systems are widely used due to the high information

transfer rate, little training and the suitability for practical
BCI applications. In spite of all these advantages, SSVEP
is not always comfortable for prolonged usage due to visual
fatigue for the user [16]. Previous studies have explored
the effect of colour and orientation of the visual stimulus
for improving the responses in SSVEP designs and also to
reduce the visual fatigue [9], [14], [16], [17]. The horizontal
LED array design has been shown to give improved response
over vertical and single LED [9].In this proposed study, we
used chip-on-board (COB) LED visual stimulus in SSVEP
elicitation as it improves the LED lighting quality and has
uniform light distribution [18]. The proposed radial visual
stimulus was designed using a single ring of green COB LED’s
with diameters of 70, 90, 110 and 130 mm as this was the
sizes available in the market. Green colour was chosen based
on results of previous study [14]. The concentric stimulus
was designed using green COB radial LED rings but with
progressive motion as explained in Section II. The horizontal
stimulus was designed using green COB LED strip of 18 mm
wide and 160 mm long.
The frequencies used in this study were 7, 8, 9 and 10
Hz as the lower frequencies gave better response [14]. The
frequencies were generated by a 32 bit microcontroller platform with LED’s driven by MOSFETs for constant brightness.
The complete system was powered by a 5 V direct current
(DC) source from a battery pack in order to avoid any line
interferences from the mains supply. The EEG responses from
all three visual stimuli were compared and analysed to identify
the visual stimulus design that has the highest performance
and reduced visual fatigue. The experiment also investigated
the influence of ring diameters in radial visual stimulus, for
evoking SSVEP response and also comfort level for the user.

II. MATERIAL AND METHODS
A. Experimental Setup
To explore the influences of radial, concentric and horizontal
stimuli on SSVEP, five participants(It is a pilot study and hence
only five participants) with perfect or corrected vision were
chosen in the age group of 24 to 45 (two males and three
females). The participants were seated 60 cm from the visual
stimulus which was placed at eye level. The participants did
not have any prior experience with BCI. Written consents were
obtained from all the participants after briefing them on the
objectives and requirements of the them. The study received
ethical approval from Faculty of Sciences Ethics Committee
at University of Kent. EEG was recorded using Emotiv EPOC
research edition with 14 electrodes, though only a single active
electrode located at O2 was used for this study. The visual
stimulus was programmed with the desired frequency to evoke
the SSVEP for a period of 30 seconds for each trial. The EEG
headset was prepared with all electrodes fitted with saline

soaked felts and positioned on participants head and good
contact was verified using Emotiv test bench software. The
recording process started with horizontal stimulus at 7 Hz
recorded for a period of 30 seconds followed by 7 Hz 70
- 130 mm radials and 7 Hz concentric circles each with the
same durations. This was repeated for five trials with a total
data collection period of 150 seconds. Recording break of one
minute was given between each 30 second recording session to
allow any previous stimuli influences to subside. The process
was repeated for all the other frequencies.

B. Visual Stimulus Design
This study used visual stimulus based on COB green LEDs
consisting of four circular rings with diameters of 70 mm, 90
mm, 110 mm and 130 mm, and one horizontal LED strip of
18 mm width and 160 mm length shown in Figure 2. Each
LED ring was individually controlled from the microcontroller
and driven by a high current MOSFET. The concentric circle
stimulus consisted of four circular LED rings flashing at the
desired frequency in a sequence of ON and OFF fashion to
produce the desired frequency. It starts with the 70 mm ring
in active high state for the desired ON period and changes to
active low followed by the 90 mm ring going active for the
same period of time as the 70 mm. This progression continues
to the 130 mm ring then repeats from 70 mm again. This entire
process produces a concentric visual stimulus in an expanding
fashion.
The LED ON/OFF timing control was designed using a
32 bit ARM Cortex M4 Teensy development board which
operates at 72 MHz and can generate frequencies precisely.
The block diagram of the schematic is shown in Figure 3. To
maintain the optimum brightness throughout the experiments,
high current MOSFETs were used for all individual LED rings
and horizontal LED strip. The complete system was powered
using a 5V DC battery pack with 5000 mA current capacity
to ensure the steady supply of power to the visual stimulus.
The visual stimulus frequencies programmed for the flickers
were 7, 8, 9 and 10 Hz with an accuracy of 0.05 Hz. The
precision of the flicker frequencies were confirmed with a
digital oscilloscope at the LED terminals.

C. EEG Data Acquisition and Processing
The EEG data was recorded using Emotiv EPOC research
edition with 14 data channels and with two reference electrodes and the layout is shown in Fig 4. In this study, only
the data from electrode O2 was used to analyse the responses
of all three visual stimulus. It is generally known that SSVEP
is maximal in occipital region and hence the chosen electrode
location [19]. The EEG data was recorded using Emotiv test
bench software for 30 seconds at 128 Hz sampling frequency
and the data was stored in the European Data Format (EDF).
Each participant had five trials for each frequency and stimulus
type. The total number of trials for each participant is as shown
in Table 1. The total recording time for all the visual stimuli
for each participant is 60 minutes (120 trials each lasting 30
seconds). The actual experimental time was slightly longer
giving time for breaks and setup. The EDF format EEG data
from channel O2 was converted to MATLAB format for offline
analysis using EEGLAB [20].

Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis
tests as normality was not assumed. The analysis was performed on maximal FFT amplitudes of EEG data from all
radial sizes, concentric circles and horizontal orientation for
all four frequencies from five participants.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
As mentioned, three different visual stimuli performances
were tested for SSVEP responses; (a) radial COB LED stimulus with sizes from 70, 90, 110 and 130mm, (b) concentric
circular patterns in expanding fashion, and (c) horizontal COB
LED stimulus. All the mentioned visual stimuli were analysed
for four frequencies 7, 8, 9, and 10 Hz.
The analysis compared data for identifying the most responsive stimulus from all three stimuli designs. Each set of
data had 150 amplitude FFT values for each frequency for
one participant. Each participant had six sets which included
70 mm, 90 mm, 110 mm, 130 mm, concentric circles and
horizontal stimuli. Figures 5 to 9 shows the box plots for the
obtained maximal FFT amplitudes for 7 Hz stimulus from five
participants for different radial sizes, concentric circles and
horizontal stimuli. The central line shows the median value
while the edges of the box are the 25th and 75th percentiles
with the whiskers extending to the most extreme values.
The Kruskal-Wallis tests, χ2 (df = 5, N = 150) showed
significant differences between stimuli for all five participants:

The 30 second recording was filtered with band-pass filter
of 2Hz bandwidth with centre frequency as the stimulus
frequency and data segmented into one second EEG segments.
The five trials for each stimulus had 150 segments of one
second data which was analysed using Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) and the maximum FFT amplitudes from each segment
were stored for statistical analysis.

The mean ranks for all different visual stimuli for five
subjects is shown in Table II. From these tables, it can be
observed that 130 mm radial stimulus gave better performance
compared with concentric and horizontal stimulus. The least
performance was from the horizontal or 70 mm radial stimuli
for all participants.
For further analysis of the SSVEP reponses, different
sizes of radial stimuli, concentric circles and horizontal
stimulus, data from all five participant were combined for
each stimulus type. For each stimulus, 750 FFT amplitude
values were used from five participants in Kruskal-Wallis
test(150 values from each participant). Figure 10 shows the
box plot representation of all stimuli from five participants.
The highest SSVEP response was for 130 mm radial stimulus
followed by 110 mm, 90 mm, 70 mm, concentric circles and
horizontal stimulus, confirming the values obtained in Table
II and boxplots in Figures 5-9.

Fig. 10. Analysis of different sized radial, concentric circles and horizontal
stimuli performances from all five participants

Analyses for other frequencies (8, 9, and 10 Hz) were
performed using the same procedure for all the participant
data. For each stimulus type, 750 FFT amplitudes values
were used from all five participants for performing the
Kruskal-Wallis test. Figures 11 to 13 show the box plots for
frequencies 8, 9 and 10 Hz. The mean ranks for all different
visual stimuli for five subjects and frequencies 8, 9, and 10
Hz are shown from Table III to Table V. The results showed
the 130 mm radial stimulus exhibited better performance than
concentric and horizontal visual stimuli, and horizontal being
the least responsive stimulus.
Fig. 9. Maximal FFT amplitude values from fifth participant

The Kruskal-Wallis tests, χ2 (df = 5, N = 750) showed
significant differences between stimuli for all five participants

for 8, 9 and 10 Hz for the three different visual stimuli;
8 Hz : H = 911.021, p = 6.81e−196
9 Hz : H = 1.48e+03 , p = 9.29e−320
10 Hz : H = 696.99, p = 1.56e−149
The lowest response was from the horizontal stimulus
when compared with radial and concentric circles. In the
radial ring comparison 130 mm had the highest performance
and 70 mm responses were the lowest in all frequency ranges.

In the frequency analysis, 7 Hz showed the highest response
as compared to 8, 9 and 10 Hz. Figure 14 shows the analysis
of 750 FFT amplitude values for 130 mm stimulus for four
frequencies. Table VI shows the mean rank for the analysis.

In visual stimulus, comfortability analysis for the participants, a scale of one to ten (ten being the most comfortable)
was used for comparing the stimulus comfort with reduced
visual fatigue. The response is shown as a bar chart in Fig
15. Even though only five participants completed the questionnaire, all participants responded 130 mm radial stimulus
as the most comfortable flicker as compared to other visual
stimuli.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this study, we investigated the influence of three different
green COB LED visual stimuli to evoke SSVEP responses
in brain. Comparisons were made between radial, concentric
circles and horizontal stimuli that flashed at frequencies 7, 8,
9, and 10 Hz. From the analysis of data from five participants,
radial stimulus exhibited the highest response for SSVEP
in all participants followed by the concentric circles and
horizontal stimuli. For the radial stimulus, the ring diameter
analysis for all the participants revealed that 130 mm had the
highest response followed by 110, 90 and 70 mm. The 70
mm radial gave better performance when compared with the
horizontal stimulus.
Furthermore, the participants observed radial stimulus was
better for viewing comfort as compared to concentric circles
and horizontal stimuli. In addition, the 130 mm radial stimulus
was more comfortable for viewing than 70 mm radial stimulus.
Therefore, it is suggested that 130 mm radial stimulus is used
to evoke SSVEP for BCI applications due to maximal response
and better viewing comfort. Future research could explore the
influence of various random and static patterns based on COB
LEDs in evoking SSVEP responses in real time.
