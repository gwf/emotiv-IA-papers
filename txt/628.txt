ABSTRACT: Whalley, Mavros and Furniss explore questions of agency, control
and interaction, as well as the embodied nature of musical performance in relation
to the use of human-computer interaction through the work Clasp Together (beta)
for small ensemble and live electronics. The underlying concept of the piece
focuses on direct mapping of a human neural network (embodied by a performer
within the ensemble) to an artificial neural network running on a computer. With
our commentary, we contextualize the work within the field of Music
Neuroscience. Specifically, we point at precedents in EEG-based musical practice
as well as ongoing research in the field. We hope to more clearly situate Clasp
Together (beta) in the broad area of Brain Computer Musical Interfaces and
discuss the challenges and opportunities that these technologies offer for
composers.

KEYWORDS: EEG, composition, cognition, live electronics, performance.

WHALLEY, Mavros, and Furniss describe a musical composition where one performer’s brainwaves
are tracked. The article documents the process of composing a new piece including realtime
measurement and sonification of brain activity. For this composition, Whalley makes use of the
Neurogranular Sampler (NGS), developed by Eduardo Miranda and John Matthias (Miranda &
Matthias, 2009). The documentation makes it easy to follow the process of this particular piece coming
to fruition from a concept to a specific implementation and performance. As a piece of research, it is
rigorous in the sense that it is easy and transparent to follow the steps involved in the development of
the piece, which can help enable artists to avoid the issues identified by the authors and come up with
solutions that better adapt to their own artistic purposes.
The work however, does not pose a significant advance in the broad field of Brain Computer
Musical Interfaces (BCMIs). A look at Whalley’s list of works reveals that Clasp Together (beta) is his
first and (as of the publication date of this commentary) only composition that utilizes EEG signals
(Whalley, 2014). This gives context to the initial struggles, assumptions, and solutions documented in
the original article, but one that risks to be repeated by others if not placed in the context of the history
of biosignals in the arts.

BRAINWAVES AND THE ARTS
The Electroencephalogram (EEG) monitors the electrical activity caused by the firing of cortical
neurons across the brain’s surface. To contextualize the work by Whalley et al., we will first give an
account of the relationship between the science of brain wave monitoring and its relationship to artistic
endeavors, from a historical perspective:
“Perhaps within the next hundred years, science will perfect a process of thought transference
from composer to listener. The composer will sit alone on the concert stage and merely think
his idealized conception of his music. Instead of recordings of actual music sound, recordings
will carry the brainwaves of the composer directly to the mind of the listener.” (Scott, 1949.

The desire for direct brain access to musical (and other artistic) content through a medium that
overrides the manual translation of ideas has been described and conceptualized by artists over time.
Even before Scott’s projection that such a device would one day become possible through the aid of
computers, in 1919 German poet Rainer Maria Rilke wrote an essay entitled Primal Sound, in which he
pointed out the similarities between the shape of the coronal suture of human skulls and the grooves
carved in early phonograph wax cylinders. In the author’s own words:
“The coronal suture of the skull has — let us assume — a certain similarity to the closely
wavy line which the needle of a phonograph engraves on the receiving, rotating cylinder of
the apparatus. What if one changed the needle and directed it on its return journey along
translation of a sound, but existed of itself naturally — well, to put it plainly, along the
coronal suture, for example. What would happen? A sound would necessarily result, a series
of sounds, music.… Feelings — which? Incredulity, timidity, fear, awe — which of all the
feelings here possible prevents me from suggesting a name for the primal sound which would
then make its appearance in the world…” (Rilke, 1978)
The poetic image painted by Rilke is captivating, yet for the contemporary reader it is easy to question
the meaningful relationship between the characteristics of the coronal suture of the skull and their link
to feelings and music. In a similar way, Scott’s projections are not currently achievable, in the sense
that an imagined sound or compositional work can not currently be rendered entirely based on the
analysis of brain activity without mapping strategies and/or additional interventions that breach the
path of direct composer-listener interaction.
Technology has now advanced to a point where there has been significant progress in the field
of Brain Computer Interfaces that are beginning to make possible the translation of subjective states to
information that can be used for the real-time control of musical devices. Novel signal analysis
methods and the proliferation of accessible and affordable consumer devices bring this ideal closer to
artistic practitioners, yet we remain at a state where the direct rendering of a fully formed composition
by brain interaction alone is not yet feasible. This current limitation has led artists and researchers to
employ a myriad of approaches when creating works that use the EEG for musical activity.

MUSICAL PRECEDENTS
Composers’ interest in the potential of brain music has a rich and long history, dating back a half
century. Alvin Lucier’s pioneering work with alpha waves in his 1964 piece Music for Solo Performer
(Holmes, 2002) is largely considered the first composition to effectively use EEG signals. Richard
Teitelbaum and David Rosenboom also explored biofeedback in the 1960s, resulting in Rosenboom’s
(now Dean of Music at the California Institute for the Arts) seminal book, Biofeedback and the Arts,
Results of Early Experiments (Rosenboom, 1976). In the digital era, Knapp and Lusted created musical
instruments that exploited the EEG (Knapp & Lusted, 1988, 1996; Lusted & Knapp, 1990; Sobolewski,
O’Mullane, Knapp, & Reilly, 2007). Miranda, whose Neurogranular Sampler (NGS) platform was used
in Clasp Together (beta), has a large body of musical work using EEG over the last ten years. This
history is documented in a special edition of the CEC’s eContact! Journal, Biotechnological
Performance Practice (Brouse, 2012; Ortiz, 2012).
Music Neuroscience is a large field of research which encompasses different goals such as:
understanding more about the brain using music as a case study, understanding more about the human
activity of music making, music perception, the role of memory in music performance, brain plasticity
in learning to play a musical instrument, and the way in which musical training can aid in the
acquisition of language and cognitive skills (Rosenboom, 2014). Such diverse areas of inquiry continue
to expand the possibilities of the use of EEG signals for artistic purposes.
In our work, for example, we rely on the use of P300 Event Related Potentials (ERPs) –
generalizable brain signals that signify the moment when an event emerges in the consciousness of
individuals (for recent work in this area see Bowman, Filetti, Alsufyani, Janssen, & Su, 2014; Spencer,
2005). As these signals are thought to represent an act of cognition, they reveal internal subjective
states of attention, bringing to the surface the materiality of cognitive processes, and as such, this has
political and sociological meaning in that the materiality of conscious thought is foregrounded
(Grierson, Kiefer, & Yee-King, 2011; Grierson & Kiefer, 2011; Grierson, 2008).
A strong plea is made for the humanitarian application of biological feedback technology. It is
in this context that Rosenboom put forth a call for artists and socially concerned scientists to pursue the
study of biofeedback as a means of opening up “the astounding ability to consciously experience and

bring under self-control many of the hitherto unconscious neural processes on which mental life is
founded.” (Blum, 1989, p. 86)

BRAIN INTERFACES TODAY
Clasp Together (Beta) falls into the area of research that focuses on the establishment of Brain
Computer Music Interfaces (BCMIs) for real-time music performance practice, where data monitored
from the human Electroencephalogram (EEG) is used in real-time to control musical processes.
The technical implementation of the piece calls for the Emotiv EPOC EEG headset, an
affordable consumer device for EEG measurement. The authors give an account of the advantages of
using this particular platform, namely: its affordability, portability, wireless connection and relative
ease of use as opposed to the intricate wiring of a traditional EEG system. This is an important
consideration as traditional EEG systems from the medical field are not well suited for stage
performance, requiring the participation of trained EEG researchers. The authors also provide two
accounts of related EEG-driven artistic works: Neuro-Knitting (Guljajeva, Canet, & Mealla, 2013) and
Brain Music (Paile, 2011). These works are good examples of recent explorations that make specific
use of the Emotiv EPOC in artistic contexts but are not representative of the state of the art research in
BCMIs. As such, the article does not broach the research field of BCMI but instead describes the
practical applications and challenges posed by the use of a specific device, within the compositional
context of a specific work. The article thus presents documentation of an evocative use of a consumer
brain-computer interface in contemporary musical practice.
The authors employed the pre-defined states as categorized by the Expressiv Suite software
provided with the EPOC headset. Because this is a proprietary “black box”, there is no indication of the
actual EEG analysis algorithms used (Lang, 2012). Several strategies have been employed to
communicate to the audience when a musical event is being controlled by the EEG signal in contrast to
fully notated musical passages and random or autonomous events generated by the NGS, although,
how the acknowledgment of these events by the audience relates to the compositional ideas is not
covered in detail.

CONCLUSION
The advent of affordable devices is allowing for the artistic exploration of EEG signals by a larger
community of practitioners. Yet, EEG analysis methodology does not have a current presence on the
musical composition curriculum at universities. Composers are not and cannot be expected to know
about the latest developments in this field. This outlines the need for more generalized devices and
analysis algorithms available for the artistic community at large and its proper documentation. Due to
the complex nature of the field there is the need for a bridge that conveys the knowledge gathered by
the dedicated researchers working on BCMIs and the wider interactive arts community (for recent work
on this area see Grierson & Kiefer (2014) and Miranda & Castet (2014).
Our commentary is on the published research paper and not on the musical work. In between
the two come technique (both musical and scientific) and method allowing composers and researchers
alike to benefit from this fascinating field’s long history. We respect the composer’s decisions in an
artistic context and admire the ambition that led to Clasp Together (beta). The article provides a good
account of the ideas, concepts and practical steps on the composition of a musical work. As such, the
reader is able to follow the challenges of dealing with novel technologies in artistic decision-making. It
provides valuable information for artists interested in using real-time EEG monitoring for musical
composition and performance.
Our commentary outlines current developments in BCI research and hope they will be of
interest to the wider musical research community. EEG monitoring in real-time for artistic purposes is
an increasingly active area of research, one whose potential is only limited by our current analysis
algorithms and the relationship between their results and the artistic uses that composers can imagine.
