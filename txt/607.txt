Abstract: Aim: The aim is to estimate the parameters of MCI by
evaluating the EEG and P-300 component of subjects. The
controlled healthy and MCI patients selected for this analysis.
The aim is to reveal the worsening cognition in the patients and
diagnose the disease at an early stage. Method: EEG recording &
P-300 measurement of 30 subjects is performed. Considering all
the possibilities and artefacts 1024-point Quantitative EEG
selected to perform the analysis. Results: The parameters of
EEG and P-300 analysis revealed the difference between
Controlled healthy and MCI group patients. Power, relative
power, symmetry, coherence, phase cross spectrum, correlation
were differentiated using QEEG analysis. Conclusion: The study
on MCI patients discovered that the mass posterior sluggish
rhythm of frequency bands dropped the alpha and beta behavior
whereas the occipital movement of the alpha and beta band in
the usual aging is increasing. The P-300 component used to
classify MCI and Controlled healthy people.

The Fig.1 shows the curve of worsening cognition with
respect to time. Time can be in months, days or years. It
shows three major cases control healthy class i.e. normal
humans, Mild cognitive impairment i.e. normal people
suffering from memory loss that means person may or may
not suffer from dementia. The threshold value shows that
below which there is Age Related Cognitive Impairment
(ARCI), means old age person may or may not suffer from
dementia. The moderate value shows that the person may
suffer from early stage dementia which can be detected and
cured. But in severe case Alzheimer disease (AD) can occur.
AD is a progressive disease which can be reverted back and
cannot be cured.

I. INTRODUCTION
The experimental arrangement of the Mild Cognitive
Impairment (MCI) is related to the memory mutilation which
cannot be compared to the definition of dementia. The MCI
can be called as pre-stage of dementia and Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). MCI is the alteration between normal ageing
and dementia. According to the research studies of ‘Semeion
Research center of Sciences of Communication’, Rome, Italy
the conversion rate of patients from MCI to AD is 6 to 40%
and from normal aging (Controlled Healthy) to AD ranges
from only 0.18% to 3.9% [2]. Pointing to this reason, the
patients or persons suffering from MCI are considered for
analysis. In order to plan the favorable remedial solution, it is
necessary to make an early diagnosis of MCI in elderly
patients which may result into developed AD [1-4].
To reveal the analysis of MCI, AD and other neurological
disorders, EEG analysis with all its frequency rhythms used
for classifying the patients and providing correct solutions to
minimize the effects of neurological disorders.
Neurophysiology, and in particular electroencephalography
(EEG), provides the appropriate means in the biomarkers
study of dementias [4, 24].

Fig 1. Classification of patients
The features of Control healthy and MCI patients are
considered for analysis.
The curve of worsening cognition with respect to time is
shown in Fig. 1. It shows three major cases control healthy
class i.e. normal humans, Mild cognitive impairment i.e.
normal people suffering from memory loss that means person
may or may not suffer from dementia. The threshold value
shows that below which there is ARCI, means old age person
may or may not suffer from dementia. The moderate value
shows that the person may suffer from early stage dementia
which can be detected and cured. But in severe case
Alzheimer disease (AD) can occur.
Therefore, for early diagnosis of dementia (MCI) it is
necessary to perform the laboratory tests, mental state
examinations, functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) etc. But these techniques are costly and require
experience clinicians.

Implementation of EEG signals and P-300 Component to Estimate Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)
The evaluation time of these techniques is very long.
Hence, effectiveness of the early diagnosis of the disease may
worsen if proper analysis tool is not used.
To
overcome
these
limitations,
appropriate
neurophysiologic techniques like EEG and MEG that are
appropriate to detain the macroscopic spatial temporal
dynamics of the electromagnetic fields of the brain are used.
Also, quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) is used as
a tool for assisting physicians to choose exact amount of EEG
data for analysis [1, 4]. This is required since EEG is
recorded for many hours or also overnight i.e. sleep EEG.
Since the EEG signal replicate practical alteration in the
cerebral cortex, it can be used to analyze neuronal
degeneration and practical impairment before actual tissue
loss can be detected by fMRI [1-4, 15, 19].
By comparing the Z-score values, statistical analysis of
EEG signals and QEEG; MCI patients and normal aged
controlled healthy person can be differentiated. The different
EEG rhythms, different states and brain regions gives the
appropriate knowledge of MCI.
Zhu B. et.al. has described the Lempel-Zev degree analysis
technique which is used to calculate the EEG parameters of
MCI patients. The brain functional characteristics and
symptoms are investigated in this paper [1].
The EEG analysis performed during meditation process is
explained in the paper. The SPECT scan technique can used
to differentiate between the patients practicing meditation
and those who do not [2].
The multiple EEG biomarkers for predicting progression
of Alzheimer’s disease at MCI stage explained by authors
shows the results of large database of neurosciences. The
neurophysiological toolbox utility is also shown by analysing
MCI patients [3].
The early detection of MCI using QEEG technique
considering the EEG rhythms is covered by Norsiah Fouzan.
The power spectral density approach is carried out to show
the difference between MCI and healthy [4].
Andras Howarth et.al critically reviews the EEG as a
biomarker of Alzheimer’s disease. The dynamical systems
theory (DST) are surveyed and also sleep studies are
performed. The synaptic neurotransmission as a potential
biomarker also enlightened [6].
Irene Sturm et.al. evaluated EEG recordings of nine
samples who submissively listened to stimuli from various
sound categories around simple tone series which examined
multivariate analysis. EEG outcrop was then employed to
determine the Cortico-Acoustic Correlation (CACor), a
measure of management between EEG signal and stimulus
[7].
In [19], EEG spectral analysis is carried out of the subjects
during MUSLIM prayer. In this technique stress is also
considered in addition to the cognition. The cognition is
compared before and after performing the Muslim
methodology of the prayer. The statistical analysis of EEG
with ANOVA explains how these techniques can be used in
biomedical engineering.
The solution approaches used in analysis of EEG are
shown in Table-I.

II. METHODOLOGY
This part explains the technique of EEG recording,
database used for analysis, various EEG frequency bands,
and QEEG analysis.
A. Database used
EEG capturing carried in a special guard room of
Shantiniketan hospital, Nagpur. EEG signals were recorded
as per the international standard of ‘10-20 electrode system’
from 24 channels using RMS-24 India machine with 1024
points sampling frequency for bipolar montages as shown in
Figure-2 and 3. These electrodes are FP1-F7, F7-T3, T3-T5,
T5-O1, FZ-CZ, CZ-PZ, FP2-F4, F4-C4, C4-P4, P4-O2,
FP1-F3, F3-C3, C3-P3, P3-O1, FP2-F8, F8-T4, T4-T6,
T6-O2 [16, 18].

Electroencephalography accounts electrical movement of
brain and brain impression using electrodes placed on the
scalp. Computing electrical actions from the brain is useful
since it imitates how the many dissimilar neurons in the brain
network communicate with each other via electrical
impulses.
The standard 10-20 electrode placement system and its
three-dimensional view which clearly shows the practical
electrode placement on the scalp after applying the gel as
shown in Fig. 2 and 3.
The mini state mental examination was also carried out to
properly differentiate between controlled healthy and MCI
patients. The cognition and dementia patients were not
considered i.e. only two groups were formed controlled
healthy and MCI.

To deal with EEG signals and to extract useful information
and features that help in early dementia diagnosis, an EEG
signal is illustrated in conditions of its rhythm’s activity in
the stated work. Medical EEG wave forms amplitude that is
typically between 10 and 100 v and at a frequency range of
1Hz to 100Hz. EEG is categorized into the following five
rhythms according to their frequency bands as follows:
Delta
: 1–3 Hz (20 v to 200 v)
Theta
: 4 – 7 Hz (5 v to 10 v)

1. Z Score
Z score is calculated as the divergence between mean
values of the samples taken (all patients) and the patient’s
entity score i.e. spectral values of all electrodes divided by the
standard deviation of the all

specific electrodes on the scalp for detecting the electrical
impulses. As per the analysis carried out, alpha and beta
waves are outweighed and a fast component of EEG.
Z score provides the data analysis of QEEG; whether there is
an increase or decrease of theta, Delta or alpha activity for
particular sets of electrodes. For e.g. excessive theta activity
at Fz. The absolute power, relative power, coherence,
frequency etc. are analyzed calculating the Z scores.
2. Multivariate Analysis
In this analysis, the groups of electrodes are formed
according to the clinical or research convenience.
For e.g. Left Lateral – F7, T3, T5; Right Central – T4, C4
and so on. Depending on this several variables like mean,
cumulative frequency etc. are obtained.
The multivariate analysis, Positive, negative and Zero Z
-scores are obtained.
3. Absolute power
The definite power in the EEG of the patient and is the
data which is measured in microvolt square.

D. EEG Signal Acquisition
The EEG of the patients has been recorded in a specialized
clinical unit state with the 10–20 system of the international
federation, which is adopted by the American EEG Society,
while resting with eyes comfortably closed, as shown in
Fig.3.
EEG device encloses a lowpass, high pass, and notch
filters. The usual frequency values for lowpass filter (LPF)
(i.e., 3 dB) are 0.15, 0.28, 1.7, and 5.4 Hz, and the upper
cutoff frequency values are, 15, 30, 70, or 300Hz. Typically,
the frequency for EEG recording for MCI range is from
0.3Hz to 70Hz, and the notch filter is 50Hz or 60Hz. The
sampling frequency is selected as 128Hz, 173Hz, or even
256Hz, 1024 and it is selected based on the application with a
12bit or 16bit A/D converter digitalizing the signal to be
more correct [16,17,33].
 24 electrodes (according to the 10-20 International
System for electrode assignment)
 The subjects i.e. patients are to be classified under
Control Healthy (CT) and MCI
 Sampling frequency of 256 and 1024 samples per
second on (RMS-EEG 24 channel), with sweep time
of 30 mm/s and SNR 7.5 µV/mm is taken.
 300 seconds signal duration is taken into picture.

4. Frequency Ratios
The values of alpha, theta, delta, beta etc.
5. Relative Power
The power percentage in any group of frequency
contrasted to total power in EEG database of the patients.
6. Coherence
Interhemispheric and Intrahemispheric coherence
measures the degree of similarity of EEG signals between
two regions.

Table II. EEG Analysis sample details
Clinical
Condition

7. Mean Frequency
The average of EEG frequency within the frequency
bands.
C. Statistical terms related to QEEG
As per the doctor’s certification, standard alpha frequency
less than 8 Hz is an abnormal frequency; condition is that
patient must be fully alert. Alpha frequency occurs in
posterior region of the brain. The lowering of alpha
frequency cannot specify the disorder but can be considered
in many cognition disorders. Therefore, Z score analysis is
performed for all EEG electrodes. The occipital region of
alpha (Oz-O2) with high value of alpha band is used for
analysis in the current study. When the EEG signal is
expressed in terms of frequency in coordination with various
frequency bands, frequency components are obtained using
period analysis. Power spectral density (PSD) demonstrate
the might of dissimilarity i.e. energy as a function of
frequency. The power spectral density is computed b
performing the Fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis using
autocorrelation function and then transforming it into
corresponding digital value of EEG [12-14]. Considering
these details, QEEG calculates different brainwaves from
different electrode positions of 10-20 electrode placement
system. QEEG determined the electrical impulse signal in
. This is proportional to the power of the signal on the

Table-II shows the samples collected i.e. the number of
patients those undergone EEG analysis. The eyes closed
analysis was carried out for entire work since eyes closed
provide artefact free data.
E. Event Related Potential
P300 ERP randomness in usual subjects is a complicated
factor in scientific event-related possible studies because it
restricts analytical applicability. The present study is
conducted to decide whether classification of P300 (P3A and
P3B) mechanism using source examination methods can
decrease discrepancy in P300 parameters. The EEG of some
patients suffering from MCI is coming out be normal after
some time/ days. The mild cognitive impairment, dementia
parameters should not change with respect to time, therefore,
a technique is to be employed for same. Hence P-300 will be
carried out and compared with EEG.P-300 is an event related
potential module obtained in the procedure of result making.

It is consider being an event managed potential, as its
incidence not only relates to the physical attributes of a
stimulus, but to a person’s reaction to it. This process is
carried out on RMS-24 channel EEG machine with P-300
stimulus installed as shown in Fig.4 [18].

B. Probability Distribution
EEG digitized signal values of a(ti) is compared to one of
the stochastic process and is distinguished by the histogram
analysis considering stationarity. The continuous EEG is
replaced by a string of numbers a(t i) which represents signal
amplitude at chronological sample moments. When ‘n’

When the brain identifies a person or a sound, it produces
a scrupulous type of electric wave which is called a P-300.
Sensors are placed to the head of a person with hearing aids
and are seated before a computer. The sensor monitors a
electrical action in the brain and register P-300 waves which
are created only if the subject has some association with the
stimulus. Therefore, P-300 is an event related potential
whereas EEG is not. This test is done to classify the patients
into normal, MCI (mild cognitive impairment) and
established dementia.
In this analysis statistical analysis of EEG including
Z-score and nonparametric technique and P-300 component
of EEG are used to classify the controlled healthy and MCI
patients.
III. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Implementation Flowchart
EEG signals are time varying signals with respect to
voltage. In clinical and research field quantitative analysis of
EEG is focused due to the requirement of digital signal
processing. Therefore, EEG signal should be processed with
respect to time as a random variable and voltage. This will
provide random set of discrete signals. This is obtained by
process of sampling, quantizing and analog to digital
conversion.
The sampling of EEG signal is done by keeping the
statistical properties unchanged. The EEG signal is sampled
at regular intervals of δt, thus changing the continuous signal
into set of impulses known as discrete signals. This is
performed by appropriate analysis of sampling theorem.
Most of the EEGs are sampled at the sampling frequency of
256 to 2048 Hz amplitude levels. The implementation
flowchart is shown in Fig.5

theorem), the relative frequency of occurrence with ‘a’ point
is obtained. i.e. n/N. where N is the total number of sample
variables in discrete form of EEG signal. The set of values
p(a(ti)) is the signal probability distribution considering the
mean and moments. The mean or average of the sample
function is given by:

The nth central moments can be defined from the above
equation. The first moment E[x(ti)] is called as the mean and
the second central moment is called variance of a(ti). The
third central moment is calculated form the skewness factor
β1. The fourth moment ‘kurtosis’ is derived from the fourth
central moment and then Z score hypothesis is formed
depending upon the samples taken.
C. Correlation Function and Spectra
The successive values of an EEG signal which results into
a stochastic process are not necessarily independent. To
calculate the degree of interdependence joint probability
distribution is is found for successive discrete values. The
covariance and autocorrelation is from the sampled values of
EEG are calculated using the
following expectation

This time average is called autocorrelation function. The
Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function is
calculated and it is called as power density spectrum. The
windowing technique is applied and close relationship is
calculated to obtain the variance.
The EEG signals are realized as random processes and
these signals are characterized by corresponding probability
distribution and its moments by autocorrelation function.
The average zero-crossing rate is used to calculate the
moments of the power spectral density.
D. Power Spectral Analysis
EEG signal is defined in terms of frequency by
establishing the frequency bands of EEG rhythms of alpha,
beta, delta and theta. The period analysis technique is used to
obtain the information of the frequency components of the
EEG signal. The appropriate method to obtain the analysis of
signal is Fourier analysis.
E. Selection of EEG signals
The 256 and 1024 sampling period artifact free EEG data
was collected form RMS 24 channel EEG machine to set up
the data file for further analysis. Then, Fourier transform
technique applied to convert the signal into frequency
domain. In filter processing, the EEG data under 0.45 Hz and
over 50 Hz is removed or excluded. Using the Inverse fast
Fourier transform) to process data by the inverse transform.
And at last Z score statistical analysis is done.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
The appropriate distribution of the EEG amplitude is
examined by observing the topographical maps. The
distribution of delta, theta, beta and alpha is flat enough all
over the cortex. Alpha is highest at the occipital region and is
present at the posterior portions of the head.
The Z scores are calculated for finding out the abnormalities
and to provide correct analysis of absolute power, relative
power, and coherence and mean frequency.
The statistical table provides the Z-score values that give the
information about raw scores and reference group average
values.
The Z-score analysis provides a suggestion of the kind of
the disorder while magnitude provides the harshness of the
disorder.
Odd examination that clusters jointly may be analytic of a
localized irregularity of cortical functions. That means
enlarged value of theta value of absolute and relative power
linked with asymmetries in the similar region may be an
suggestion of localized area dysfunction.
Regional abnormalities can be associated with dementia,
depression or stress. Understanding of the position of the
abnormality with reference to the MCI patient and in
correlation with the EEG signal; QEEG is necessary to
perform.
A. QEEG Analysis
The QEEG analysis is done for Female patient in the group
of MCI (z scores shown later) form 30 samples with age of 68
years. The EEG analysis was performed on RMS-24 channel

machine as shown in the figure. The bipolar montages are
selected according to the 10-20 electrode system with linked
years.
The qEEG study were abnormal from normal and showed
dysregulation in bilateral frontal lobes especially in the right
frontal lobe, bilateral temporal lobes especially in the left
temporal lobe, bilateral parietal lobes especially in the right
parietal lobe and bilateral occipital lobes especially in the
right occipital lobe.
LORETA (8Hz.) showed deregulation in the right better
temporal gyrus, right inferior parietal lobule, right posterior
insula and right fusiform gyrus.
The frontal lobes are occupied in executive functioning,
abstract thinking, expressive language, sequential planning,
mood control and social skills.
The temporal lobes are concerned in acoustic analysis of
brain activities, short-term memory, and accessible speech on
the left and features identification on the right.
The parietal lobes are implicated in visual-spatial
information processing, short-term memory, executive
attention, accessible speech on the left and empathy control
and awareness of emotional expression in others on the right
(e.g., prosody).
The occipital lobes are involved in the visual processing of
colour, form, movement, visual perception and spatial
processing.
The posterior insular cortex is involved in autonomic
system regulation and representation of the physiological
state of the body. This is involved in analysing the colour
information, body and face identification, word detection,
and within-category identification. To the extent there is
difference from normal electrical prototypes in these
structures, then sub-optimal execution is predictable.
The Linked Ears power spectral investigation were
abnormal from usual with extreme power in bilateral frontal
regions especially in the right frontal region over a broad
frequency range, excessive power was present in bilateral
temporal regions especially in the left temporal region from 1
- 3 Hz, extreme power was present in bilateral parietal
regions especially in the right parietal region over a wide
frequency range and excessive power was also present in
bilateral occipital regions especially in the right occipital
region from 1 - 4 Hz.
EEG amplitude irregularity, consistency and EEG phase
were unusual from normal, especially in frontal, temporal,
parietal and occipital regions. Elevated coherence was there
in frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital regions which
point out compact functional differentiation. Reduced
coherence was present in frontal, temporal, parietal and
occipital regions which indicate reduced practical
connectivity. Both circumstances are regularly associated to
reduced speed and effectiveness of information processing.
The Fig.6 shows surface neurofeedback recommendation.
These are the values obtained by the clinical evaluation of the
patient by comparing the reference values of the database
results. The delta, theta frequencies are obtained in the polar
and central regions of the electrodes.

A 68-year old male patient with fluctuating memory
complaints and mild extra pyramidal signs that started a
couple of years ago. Clinically, AD was suspected as cause of
his symptoms. His EEG (24 channels; source derivation) was
moderately severely abnormal with an evident slowing of the
background rhythm (peak frequency 6.3 Hz, only theta-delta
activity at the posterior EEG channels.

The limitation of the existing study is that, the database
considered is small. At least 100-150 patient database is to be
collected and this will be included in the future work.
V. CONCLUSION
This part of the paper discusses about the different
parameters that are evaluated for the two groups controlled
healthy and MCI
 EEG can be used as a way of analyzing of pre-stage
Alzheimer disease i.e. MCI. Different deviations are
created in the EEG signals. If the EEG signals are
slowed down, compact difficulty, Perturbations in
synchrony actions are some of the irregularities
found.
 EEG signals of patients affected by pre-Alzheimer’s
disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and controlled
healthy samples were examined and processed by
concerning a time-frequency analysis.
 The analyzed datasets have often been small and
additional studies are needed to confirm those
promising results. However, the above results can be
used to classify and analyze the EEG as a useful
clinical evaluation tool in the discrimination of
established dementia.
 EEG-based detection of the progress of dementia and
classification of its severity are highly desirable
viewing methods in medical practice due to its less
cost and convenient features make it a promising
technique.
 EEG can then be of help in a specific differential
diagnosis to make one of the diagnoses a more or
less likely cause of the patient’s symptoms.

The finding of the proposed explains about choosing the
proper quantity of EEG which can be used to study the
different Neuro-physiological diseases. The statistical
analysis of the EEG shows the comparison between the
reference values and calculated values of the patients. Also,
Event related potential P-300 helps in analyzing the neuro
test more correctly, since electrode placement, time required
for test is easy as compared to EEG analysis.

The inspection on Mild cognitive impairment collection of
samples exposed the mass posterior sluggish frequency
rhythms of EEG dropping the beta and alpha behavior
whereas the occipital movement of the alpha and beta band in
the controlled healthy group is rising. The results illustrated
the allotment of delta and theta power analysis or slow
cerebral measure for both controlled healthy and the MCI. A
decrease of delta at the sub-frontal areas for the standard and
middle regions is related to the cognitive rejection at the
hippocampal area. Investigation of EEG exposed statistically
noteworthy changes of slowing the EEG movement of the
MCI group. There is a boost in delta and theta at the posterior
and left temporal region of the brain (T6, T5) and prefrontal
lobe (F7, F8) of the brain amongst the MCI over the
controlled normal aging group and increase in Beta 1 and
Beta 2 over the temporal areas among MCI group. Also, there
is a noteworthy reduction in alpha rhythm frequency at the
central region (C3, Cz, C4) and posterior region.
In early stages of the disease, relative theta power
increases together with a decrease in relative beta power and
slowing of the peak frequency. In later stages, further
slowing occurs reflected by additional decreases in relative
alpha power and increases in relative delta power.
