Abstract—Non-invasive Brain Computer Interface like
Electroencephalography (EEG) which directly taps neurological
signals, is being widely explored these days to connect paralytic
patients/elderly with the external environment. However, in India the
research is confined to laboratory settings and is not reaching the
mass for rehabilitation purposes. An attempt has been made in this
paper to analyze real time acquired EEG signal using cost effective
and portable headset unit EMOTIV. Signal processing of real time
acquired EEG is done using EEGLAB in MATLAB and EDF
Browser application software platforms. Independent Component
Analysis algorithm of EEGLAB is explored to identify deliberate eye
blink in the attained neural signal. Time Frequency transforms and
Data statistics obtained using EEGLAB along with component
activation results of EDF browser clearly indicate voluntary eye blink
in AF3 channel. The spectral analysis indicates dominant frequency
component at 1.536000Hz representing the delta wave component of
EEG during voluntary eye blink action. An algorithm is further
designed to generate an active high signal based on thoughtful eye
blink that can be used for plethora of control applications for
rehabilitation.

ONVENTIONALLY, Brain Computer Interface (BCI)
technology mainly focuses on invasive and non-invasive
methodology where the latter is ahead due to simple design
and ease to use. A brain computer interface needs some brain
signal as an input for its functionality. So far, various EEG
signals such as Virtual Evoked Potentials (VEPs), Slow
Cortical Potentials (SCPs), P300, and sensorimotor rhythms,
have been explored for controlling BCI functionality. Both
transient VEPs (TVEPs) and steady-state VEPs (SSVEPs))
have been used immensely for BCI control [1]-[7]. Although
efficiencies of these systems are acceptable but have failed to
comply with problems like maintaining continuous permanent
attention to external stimuli and regular control. Another
feature of EEG i.e. slow cortical potentials can be used for
BCI technology. Even with some considerable research
involving SCPs in past [8]-[12], they are not so favorite
among current BCI researchers. The reason behind this

approach is low transmission rate and involvement of long
tedious training and testing sessions. Other option for BCI
control is P300. BCIs based on visual P300 evoked potentials
comprising matrices of numbers, letters and other commands
have also been broadly surveyed [13]-[15]. Sensorimotor
rhythms have also been researched extensively for BCI
control. Wadsworth [16], Berlin [17] and Graz [18] employ
sensorimotor rhythms in their BCIs, as control signals.
Disadvantages of these technologies are lower bit rate and
requirement of multichannel EEG recording for good
performance. Most of the methods involving BCI control
using these brain signals involve certain significant
drawbacks. Hence we use a simple and easy to implement
method for generating brain signals for BCI control, i.e neural
potentials generated from deliberate eye blink.
Only countable research work has been done on eye blink
detection and its use as a trigger for control applications.
Pander et al. uses EOG signals and detection function
generator for eye blink detection with moderate results on
various eye blink parameters [19]. Udayashankar et al.
designed an eye blink based control unit using face tracking
with the help of HAAR cascade classifier (trained) and
template matching technique [20]. Sammaiah et al. provided a
system using cornea-retinal potentials [21]. Panning et al.
presented an algorithm for eye blink detection using color
based approach in facial images [22]. Jiang-Wei et al.
provided a multi-oriented Gabor response analysis of eye
images [23]. These responses were analyzed to detect eye
blink. Most of the work referred above involved modalities
other than EEG for eye blink detection. However, Chambayal
et al. developed an algorithm to detect eye blink from EEG
signals using LABVIEW platform [24] and Rihana et al. used
BioRadio portable device to acquire EEG signals and
Probabilistic Neural Network for signal classification [25].
Both these techniques used conventional methods for
detection of eye blink neural responses and efficiencies of
their systems are quite moderate.
Lot of researchers explored controlling of various
mechanical and electrical devices using BCI, but very few of
them are non-invasive. The most suitable non-invasive option
for interfacing a brain and computer is EEG. However, to
acquire EEG signal in research institutes is quite a difficult
process and require trained staff. For these reasons, our work
involves the use of commercially manufactured EEG
acquisition device, the Emotiv EPOC. There are several other
headsets present commercially for EEG acquisition but
because of higher bit rate and better resolution, Emotiv Epoch
is best suitable for our studies. A comparative study of various

The motive of this research is to explore the methodology and

In this work, an EEG-based BCI for the rehabilitative
control is developed by analyzing neural responses of the
human subject corresponding to distinct actions. The
functional work flow of the developed BCI is shown in Fig. 1.
It consists of signal acquisition, signal processing and
algorithm development.

corresponding to any activity present in the channel data [27].
This provides a basis for locating voluntary eye blinks and
other subject actions. Different ICA decomposition algorithms
available in EEGLAB toolbox are runica.m (selects neural
components having super-gaussian activity distribution) and
jader.m (utilizes fourth order moment to identify the neural
activity in response to certain deliberate action). In this work,
runica.m is implemented for 10s length input EEG data in
order to extract their time-frequency transforms and data
statistics. Furthermore, spectral analysis is done to extract the
frequency component of the EEG signal at voluntary eye
blink.
C. Algorithm Development
An algorithm is further designed to decode an active high
signal based on thoughtful eye blinking that can be used for
EEG based BCI for controlling applications for rehabilitation.
Fig. 2 illustrates the designed algorithm to use EEG as a
trigger that can also be used to develop a prosthetic device
controlled by human neural signals. The recorded EEG signal
(.edf) is imported to MATLAB workspace in order to obtain
its absolute/maximum value. Then the corresponding mean is
calculated from the band pass filtered signal to extract its
threshold value. Now, signal filtered at each point is compared
with the threshold obtained via K-NN algorithm, and divide
and conquer method. If it is found larger than the threshold
value, the selected action’s neural response can be used as a
trigger for control applications.

EEG signal

A. Signal Acquisition
Real time EEG dataset is acquired from subject’s scalp
using cost effective and portable EEG Neuro-headset unit
EMOTIV. It is capable of acquiring neural signals generated
in response to distinct actions of subject using its 14-assembly
electrode sensors (AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8,
FC6, F4, F8, AF4 with 2 reference electrodes P3 and P4). The
acquired EEG signal is transmitted to laptop through the
wireless Bluetooth dongle. The EEG dataset is recorded at a
sampling frequency of 128Hz and is saved as .edf (European
data format) file. EEG dataset is recorded for single subject’s
deliberate eye-blink action.
B. Signal Processing
Signal processing of real time acquired EEG is done using
EEGLAB v 13.0.1 in MATLAB workspace and EDF Browser
application software platforms. Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) algorithm of EEGLAB is explored to identify
deliberate eye blink in the attained neural signals through
scalp channels. The ICA decomposition of signals leads to the
extraction of maximally temporally independent EEG signals

blink action is plotted in Fig. 3 using EDF Browser. The signal
is filtered using butter-worth high pass filter and the
corresponding power spectrum using Fast Fourier transform is
plotted in Fig. 4. The spectral analysis indicates the dominant
frequency component at 1.536000Hz representing the delta
wave component during deliberate eye blink action. This also
interprets that the intensity of action corresponds to standard
frequency range of the EEG signal.
Thus, component activation results of EDF Browser clearly
indicate forced eye blink in AF3 channel.

baseline mean power spectrum. As clear from component
time-frequency plot, the power increases in the upper panel
during the frequency range 0-4Hz thus, represents the delta
wave component during eye blink action. The lower image
represents the Inter-Trial coherence (ITC) at all frequencies
and the lower most part corresponds to the ERP’s (event
related potentials) that clearly indicates component activation
prior to 4ms due to the appearance of oscillatory activity in the
ERP. This is reflected in the spectrogram with brighter color
bars.

the component activation using super Gaussian activity
distribution. Component time-frequency plot during eye blink
is depicted in Fig. 6. It represents the time-frequency
decomposition of component activation and is an index of
changes in the spectral content of the dataset in response to
some voluntary action. The upper left part corresponds to the

In order to determine the degree of synchronization between
component activations, component phase coherence plot
during eye blink is plotted in Fig. 7. Clusters (highlighted area
with red circle) of high correlation are noted again around 4ms
representing the component activation (eye blink) region.
Component activation scroll plot during eye blink is shown in
Fig. 8. It is important to scroll EEG activation data to
completely interpret the neural responses for certain subject
actions. While scrolling, component ‘1’ (red circle) appears to
account primarily for eye blink action. The activity spectrum
of different data channels is plotted in Fig. 9. Different colored
traces in channel spectra correspond to the activity spectrum
of individual data channels. The results verify component

activation in different spectra plots during deliberate eye blink.
This identified component activation is further utilized to
design an algorithm (Fig. 2) to generate an active high during
eye blinking. This reflects the use of EEG as a trigger that can
also be used to develop EEG-based BCI for the rehabilitative
control applications.

IV. CONCLUSION

Fig. 7 Component phase coherence plot during eye blink

An efficient, cost-effective and portable EEG based BCI
using EMOTIV EEG neuro-headset is implemented in this
research. An independent component decomposition using
EEGLAB toolbox is employed to identify the component
activation in the acquired neural signals during deliberate eye
blink. Different spectral analysis techniques viz. power
spectrum, time-frequency plot and phase coherence plot have
been efficiently explored in order to accurately recognize the
dominant frequency component corresponding to single and
double eye blink action of human subject. This leads to the
development of an algorithm to use EEG as a trigger for
various control applications for rehabilitation. The future work
may include development of a prosthetic device which can be
externally used as a medical tool to assist complete or partial
paralyzed patients and also patients suffering from voluntary
motor disorder such as speech loss or amputation.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT
This research has been made possible owing to the
encouragement and support provided by our institute ‘Manav
Rachna International University’ and the platform that has
been provided to work as a team.
