Eye movements and brain oscillations to
symbolic safety signs with different
comprehensibility
Yohana Siswandari1 and Shuping Xiong1,2*

Abstract
Background: The aim of this study was to investigate eye movements and brain oscillations to symbolic safety
signs with different comprehensibility.
Methods: Forty-two young adults participated in this study, and ten traffic symbols consisting of easy-to-comprehend
and hard-to-comprehend signs were used as stimuli. During the sign comprehension test, real-time eye movements
and spontaneous brain activity [electroencephalogram (EEG) data] were simultaneously recorded.
Results: The comprehensibility level of symbolic traffic signs significantly affects eye movements and EEG spectral
power. The harder to comprehend the sign is, the slower the blink rate, the larger the pupil diameter, and the longer
the time to first fixation. Noticeable differences on EEG spectral power between easy-to-comprehend and hard-tocomprehend signs are observed in the prefrontal and visual cortex of the human brain.
Conclusions: Sign comprehensibility has significant effects on real-time nonintrusive eye movements and brain
oscillations. These findings demonstrate the potential to integrate physiological measures from eye movements and
brain oscillations with existing evaluation methods in assessing the comprehensibility of symbolic safety signs.

Background
Safety signs have been widely used to deliver warning
messages to their intended users, in order to prevent
dangerous situations. The safety sign comprehension
process itself can be regarded as a part of the “communications–human information processing” or C-HIP
model (Fig. 1) established by Wogalter et al. [1]. This
model is a framework which describes the stages involved as information flows from a source to a receiver,
who will process the information, and subsequently produces behavior. Basing on a communication theory, this
model developed three conceptual stages: source, channel, and receiver. Each stage of the C-HIP model allows
information to be carried out to the next stage, or it can

produce a “bottleneck” which will block the flow that
will affect the end of the process, which is behavioral
compliance. In order to get the “receiver” to react accordingly to a specific message or information, the
whole procedure should be completed in a correct manner. A “bottleneck” or misunderstanding that occurs
during one or more stages in this C-HIP model would
result in the original message or information being perceived wrongly, which will lead to unintended behavior
of the information receiver. The first stage, source, is the
origin or initial transmitter of the risk information,
which can be a person(s) or an organized entity (e.g.,
government). The second stage, channel, consists of two
basic dimensions. One concerns the media in which the
information is shown (e.g., posters, brochures, and labels). Whereas the second dimension concerns the sensory modality used by the receiver to capture this
information. The receiver stage is further broken down
into substages: attention switch and maintenance,

comprehension, beliefs and attitudes, and motivation to
carry out the compliance behavior (Fig. 1).
Out of all the substages in receiver stage, comprehension can be regarded as the most substantial since the
correct information flow from this substage plays a big
role in transmitting the intended information to the receiver. The faulty design of safety signs could lead to increased potential risks or hazards in public places. For
example, a study by Gazmarian et al. [2] with 2659 hospital patients showed that 54 % patients with low health
literacy could not understand instructions to take medication on an empty stomach, and 48 % did not understand to take medication every 6 h. Another study by
Kirmizioglu and Tuydes-Yaman [3] reported that one
major factor affecting safe driving is the comprehensibility of traffic signs by drivers. The results of these studies
have affirmed the fact that safety sign comprehension is
of utmost importance. Therefore, comprehensibility of
safety signs should be ensured prior to being implemented in various public places.
Various evaluation methods have been developed in
the past to measure the comprehensibility of the safety
sign [4–10]; most of them rely on the guessability score
and sometimes cognitive sign features. ISO 9186-1 specifies a method for testing the comprehensibility of
graphical symbols and uses the guessability score (GS)
from open-ended responses as a measure of the degree
to which a graphical symbol communicates its intended
message to recipients [8]. In ISO 9186-1, each openended response needs be assigned to fully correct, partially correct, or wrong to assess the comprehensibility
in terms of GS, as a standard in pictorial comprehension
test. However, there is unavoidable subjectivity of the
scoring method for evaluating the participants’ openended responses in the process of obtaining GS, especially for “partially correct” answers [11]. More importantly, this evaluation method involves questions which
require the users to give their opinions or ratings on the
tested stimuli after they have “experienced” the stimuli.

However, these opinions may be distorted by memory
and consciousness effects [12].
Previous studies showed that changes in various physiological processes and states covary with changes in cognitive load elicited by stimuli or objects of attention [13, 14].
There are several advantages of utilizing physiological
measures to infer cognitive load: (1) these measures are
relatively unobtrusive, (2) these measures do not require
overt performance, and (3) most of physiological measures
are continuously recorded; they provide us the chance to
present measures that respond relatively quickly to phasic
shifts in cognitive process [15]. Relating to the aforementioned C-HIP model, some physiological measures seem
to correspond with certain stages. Eye tracking data and
measures were investigated in this study since people use
their visual modality (stage 2: channel) to capture information conveyed by safety signs. Moreover, eye tracking
has been used as an effective tool in a wide variety of studies since it serves as a “mirror” to understanding human
attention and behavior when engaged in a specific activity
[16, 17]. Brain activity was also investigated since it is
closely linked with comprehension in the receiver stage
and it provides a “window” into the human mind [17–21].
The primary purpose of the current study was to investigate eye movements and brain oscillations to symbolic safety signs with different comprehensibility. The
findings of this study could provide preliminary evidences on integrating potential physiological measures
from eye movements and brain oscillations with existing
evaluation methods in assessing the comprehensibility of
the symbolic safety signs.

Methods
Participants

Forty-two young Korean adults (24 males: 21.2 ± 1.44 years
old; 18 females: 20.2 ± 1.31 years old) participated in this
study. Each participant provided written informed consent
on a protocol approved by the university institutional review board (IRB No.14-17-01-A). The selection criteria
are that they should have normal or corrected-to-normal
vision, have no colorblindness and red-green deficiencies,
and are right-handed. Additionally, participants were
instructed not to consume any drinks containing alcohol
or caffeine 24 h before their scheduled experiment time,
to decrease the likelihood of participants being intoxicated
during the experiment.
Experimental stimuli

Ten symbolic traffic signs (Fig. 2) were used as stimuli in
this study. Among those signs, five widely used road signs
(S1—do not turn right; S4—do not turn left; S7—U-turn
is prohibited; S9—do not go straight; S10—turn right)
were hypothesized to be easy to comprehend, and the
other five new road signs in UK (S2—no vehicle carrying

explosives; S3—headphone users may be lost in music;
S5—tourist area; S6—caution texter; S8—risk of grounding) were hypothesized to be hard to comprehend.
Experimental procedure

After a practice session to familiarize the participant
with the setup and experimental procedure, comprehension tests were conducted for ten traffic symbols and the
order of the displayed symbols was randomized. During
the comprehension test, investigated signs were displayed using Tobii studio software (Tobii Technology),
and the participant was asked to guess its actual meaning in an open-ended test [10, 22, 23]. Each participant
was given a chance to look at the sign for 10 s, and after
that, a new screen would prompt the question “What
does the sign mean?” and participants had to give their
answers verbally in Korean and ended it with “kkeut” (a
Korean term for “ended”). During the 10-s period of sign
comprehension, each participant’s real-time physiological data of eye movements and brain activity were
simultaneously captured with Tobii X2-60 eye tracker
and Emotiv EPOC neuroheadset, respectively (Fig. 3a).
The internationally standardized 10-20 system is
employed to record the spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG), prioritizing on six channels (Fig. 3b) which
were hypothesized to be linked with cognitive load (F3,
F4), visual stimuli processing (O1, O2), and auditory
stimuli processing (T7, T8; used as the baseline). For
best performance, distance from the participant’s eyes

should be approximately 60–65 cm, and his/her gaze
angle should not exceed 36° when the participant was
located around 65 cm from the eye tracker. To comply
with the angle requirement, an adjustable chair was used
for the participant. All participants were told not to
make unnecessary body movements and not to look
away from the screen during the 10-s viewing time, in
order to ensure the quality of physiological data
recording.
The EEG and eye tracker started to record each participant’s data right after stimuli onset, and stopped after
10 s had ended for each sign. No physiological data was
recorded when participants were giving their answers
verbally. This procedure was repeated for ten signs. The
whole session was recorded by a video camera and also
an android-based voice-recorder app, Easy Voice Recorder Pro. The whole experiment lasted for approximately 1 h.
Data processing and statistical analysis

To calculate the guessability score of each sign, a scoring
procedure was carried out as follows. Two judges independently assessed the accuracy of the responses given
by the participants. Correct understanding of the actual
meaning of the sign symbol (over 80 % understood) was
given one point, getting very close to the actual meaning
(understood 66–80 %) was given 0.75 points, and getting
close to the actual meaning (understood 50–65 %) was
given 0.5 points. Giving the opposite answer to the

actual meaning caused a one-point deduction, and zero
points were awarded for any other answer [24]. Analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to see whether
there was significant difference in the comprehensibility
among signs. A Bonferroni post hoc test was conducted
to group the signs based on their comprehensibility.
Signs with a guessability score of at least 85 % were
regarded as easy-to-comprehend signs, ie., good signs
(ANSI Z535.3 [25]), and signs with a guessability score
below 40 % were regarded as hard-to-comprehend signs
(bad signs).
Three eye-movement measurements from eye tracking
data were investigated: blink rate, pupil diameter, and
time to first fixation. For each measurement of a particular participant, the result was averaged across different
signs within the same comprehension group (good or
bad signs). Pupil diameters for good and bad signs were
investigated for 0.5–1s time interval after stimulus onset.
The 0.5–1 s was chosen as the observed time interval
since the pupil can react to stimuli in 0.2 s, with the response peaking in 0.5–1 s after stimuli onset [26, 27].
Power spectral analysis was conducted to analyze EEG
data [18]. First, raw data from six investigated channels
for each sign was extracted using an interactive Matlab
toolbox for EEG signal processing (EEGLAB). Fast Fourier transform (FFT) was then applied to transform the
raw data to a frequency spectrum, resulting in frequency
(Hz) on the x-axis and power (μV2/s) on the y-axis.
After that, the FFT-ed data was divided into different
bands according to the natural frequencies of the brain:
delta (0.5–3 Hz), theta (3.5–7 Hz), alpha (8–13 Hz), and
gamma (30–70 Hz) [28]. For each participant, the average power of each frequency band across signs which
belong to the same comprehension group was calculated
for each channel. Therefore, the EEG data of each

participant for further statistical analysis was the averaged delta, theta, alpha, and gamma signal power for the
two groups of signs with different comprehensibility, for
each investigated channel. To examine the hemispheric
lateralization during sign comprehension, the right (R)
hemisphere vs. left (L) hemisphere power asymmetry indices for each frequency band were computed for three
homologous sites (F4–F3, O2–O1, T8–T7), using the
formula of (R − L)/(R + L) [29]. Laterality itself was described as qualitatively different functions from homologues areas in the left and right hemispheres [30].
Paired t tests were conducted to check whether different comprehensibility levels (easy-to-comprehend and
hard-to-comprehend) of the tested signs affect eye tracking and EEG measures. An additional one-sample t test
was performed on inter-hemispheric power asymmetry
indices to check the significance of the hemispheric
lateralization. SAS JMP 10 was used for statistical analyses at a significance level of 0.05.

Results
Guessability score

The descriptive statistics of guessability scores for ten
traffic signs are shown in Table 1. ANOVA results
showed that the guessability score differed significantly
among different signs [F(9,41) = 321.09, p < 0.001], and
Bonferroni post hoc grouping analysis showed two different groups (A for easy-to-comprehend signs; B for
hard-to-comprehend signs) in terms of comprehensibility. Five signs (signs 1, 4, 7, 9, 10) were classified as
easy-to-comprehend signs (good signs), while the other
five signs (signs 2, 3, 5, 6, 8) were classified as hard-tocomprehend signs (bad signs). The guessability scores
for good signs were all higher than 97 % (higher than
the recommended 85 % score by ANSI Z535.3), and the

Blink rate

Differences in blink rates elicited by signs with different
comprehensibility levels are shown in Fig. 4. It revealed
that signs which were hard to comprehend (bad signs)
elicited a significantly less number of blinks (18.0 blinks/
min for bad signs vs. 33.6 blinks/min for good signs; p <
0.0001) compared to signs which were easy to comprehend (good signs).
Pupil diameter

Significant differences in pupil diameters between the
bad and good signs (p < 0.0001) were observed (Fig. 5).
Bad signs elicited larger pupil diameters (an average of
2.9 mm), compared to the good signs (an average of
2.6 mm).

EEG measures

Figure 7 provides a typical example of experimental results on the gamma frequency band from power spectral
analysis. Summarized results (Table 2) showed that even
though there is no significant difference between the
good and bad signs for delta band in all investigated
channels, theta power is significantly and consistently
higher for the good signs in both channel F3 (p = 0.002)
and channel F4 (p < 0.001), which were located on the
prefrontal cortex of human brain. With respect to the
alpha band, spectral analysis results showed the good
signs have significantly higher power than bad signs in
all channels except channels T7 (p = 0.407) and T8 (p
= 0.472). For the gamma band, the good signs have a
significantly lower power than bad signs in channels

hemispheric differences are limited to the alpha and
theta bands for the F4–F3 site pairing and the alpha
band for the T8–T7 site pairing. Additionally, regardless
of the frequency bands, the power asymmetry indices for
the O2–O1 site pairing were always much larger than
the other two site pairings (F4–F3, T8–T7).

Overall results for the investigated physiological measures are summarized in Table 2, which showed that 13
out of a total of 27 investigated physiological measures
evoked significant changes when the participants were
exposed to signs with different levels of comprehensibility (good and bad signs).

Discussion
In the past few decades, a large body of safety sign research has examined how sign characteristics (such as
color, shape, symbol, incongruent information) and receiver personal factors (such as age, gender, belief, perception of risk, stress) impact warning effectiveness [31].
These studies provide basic principles and guidelines for
the design and implementation of more effective safety
signs; however, the present study takes a further step by
investigating the underlying human attention and

cognitive processes that affect sign comprehension.
This is the first study, to our knowledge, to investigate safety sign comprehensibility by utilizing physiological measures from eye tracking and spontaneous
brain activity data. Real-time nonintrusive monitoring
of human eye movements and brain oscillations during sign comprehension can provide us detailed and
objective information on human attention and cognitive processes [17, 32].
In this study, we set a short period of time (10 s) and
ask participants to look at each displayed sign and pay
close attention to it, no matter if it is easy to comprehend or hard to comprehend. The participants should
always stay focused on each sign for 10 s during the
process of comprehension. Analysis on the temporal
variation data of eye tracking showed that there is no

significant change on eye movements, especially pupil
diameter with the time (see Fig. 9 for typical examples)
when a sign is displayed in the 10-s period. Therefore,
the physiological differences should be largely affected
by the different sign stimuli, and the confounding effects
from the different actions of participants on comprehending two groups of signs (such as ceasing to pay attention to easy-to-comprehend signs during the later
stage of the 10-s period but continuing to pay attention
to hard-to-comprehend signs during whole 10-s period)
should be minimal.
The results of this study demonstrated that the physiological measures of eye movements and the brain’s natural oscillations were able to reflect the changes from
different comprehensibility levels of traffic symbols. The
first and most prominent indicator found in this study

bands. The significant differences between the right and left hemispheres are marked as asterisks

was the blink rate, which was inversely related with
comprehension difficulty. This result is consistent with
previous studies. Holland and Tarlow [33] stated that
blink occurs at the moment of cognitive change. For example, in some cases when participants were concentrating on finding an answer to a specific problem, they
tend not to blink, and when they found the answer, blink
occurs. Telford and Thompson [34] and Broadbent [35]
reported that participants tend to suspend blinking while
something interesting catches their attention and when
information in memory is being operated on. In the case
of safety sign comprehension, participants tend to perform less number of blinks while being exposed to a
hard-to-comprehend sign, since they had to concentrate
and focus their attention to the displayed sign in order
to guess the actual meaning of the sign correctly. In
addition, when compared to a normal blink rate of
24.36 blinks/min obtained from Cardona et al. [36], a

decreased blink rate (18.0 blinks/min) was observed
when participants were trying to comprehend a bad sign,
suggesting that more cognitive load was required during
this task. On the contrary, when participants were exposed to an easy-to-comprehend sign, it was expected
that they would spend less cognitive load to guess the
meaning of the sign, thus allowing faster blinks
(33.6 blinks/min) when they set their attention loose.
In terms of pupil diameter, results showed that the increasing cognitive load was accompanied by an increasing pupil diameter within the time interval of 0.5–1 s
following stimuli onset, resulting in larger pupil diameters for signs with low comprehensibility, in comparison
with signs with high comprehensibility. This result is in
line with previous studies which reported that pupil dilation is positively associated with increasing cognitive
load [37–39]. Different comprehensibility levels of signs
were also found to significantly affect time to first

fixation. Results from our study suggested that participants had difficulties fixating their gaze on one part of
the pictogram when exposed to signs with a low comprehensibility level, resulting in a longer time to first fixation. This result should be reasonable and can be
supported by findings from previous studies [40, 41]. Salience could be another factor that affects time to first
fixation [42, 43]. Pictograms used in the good signs
probably contain a more prominent aspect that can be
easily detected by the viewers compared with the pictograms used in the bad signs.
With regard to EEG signal, alpha, theta, delta, and
gamma oscillations were examined in this study since
they have been reported to govern cognitive processes
[28]. Significant alpha, theta, and gamma power differences between good and bad signs were found in channels F3 and F4, which were parts of the prefrontal cortex
of the brain. These results were reasonable, since the association between functions of the prefrontal cortex and
various cognitive behaviors including orchestration of
thoughts and actions and access to working memory
had been acknowledged in many previous studies
[44–49]. Miller and Cohen [48] reported that the

Page 9 of 12

prefrontal cortex plays a very important role in cognitive performance. They stated that representative
areas in the prefrontal cortex can function as attentional templates by providing top-down signals to
other parts of the brain which will guide the flow of
activities needed to perform a cognitive task. More
specifically, alpha power was observed to be higher
for easy-to-comprehend signs in this study; this result
was in line with a previous study by Klimesch [18]
which suggested that an overall decrease in alpha
power indicated an increasing cognitive load in general. According to Klimesch’s study in 1996 [50],
alpha power was blocked or attenuated by attention
and mental effort, which also explains the results obtained in the current study. Our study showed
9.9~13 % decreases of alpha power in both the prefrontal and visual lobes. Similar tendencies were also
observed in a study with Alzheimer patients [50],
where upper alpha power showed about 26 % decrease for tasks which require higher mental effort.
Interestingly, about 9 % increase was also reported in
the lower alpha power for tasks with higher mental
effort. This finding is also noteworthy for future research, since dichotomy in the alpha frequency range
could have led scientists to discover a more interesting nature of cognitive processes while encoding
visual stimuli. Higher theta power was found for
easy-to-comprehend signs since these signs can be
encoded better compared to the bad signs [51, 52].
This result is also supported by a comprehensive
study of brain oscillation from Klimesch [50], which
suggested that theta oscillation is linked to an encoding process of new information. Lower gamma power
in the prefrontal cortex (channels F3 and F4) was
found for easy-to-comprehend signs; this could be explained by increasing gamma oscillations being possibly associated with the cognitive processing of
attended stimuli [53]. In the current study, the
gamma power in the prefrontal cortex showed
10.2~11.7 % increases, when participants were exposed with hard-to-comprehend signs. A similar pattern was also reported by Başar-Eroglu et al. [54],
who investigated the visual perception of ambiguous
patterns and reported 40~50 % increases in human
frontal gamma activity, in comparison to spontaneous
EEG recordings. The differences on the amount of
changes in their study and our current study might
be due to different cognitive tasks administered and
the participants in the experiments. Many previous
studies have showed that brain oscillations are correlated with multiple functions and are highly
dependent on tasks, sensation, and individuals [28].
Aside from investigating channels in the prefrontal
cortex, the present study also investigated the visual

Siswandari and Xiong Journal of Physiological Anthropology (2015) 34:42

cortex of the human brain, represented by channels
O1 and O2, since visual stimuli was utilized to capture the participant’s attention during the experiment.
Higher alpha and gamma power was observed for
easy-to-comprehend signs in both channels O1 and
O2. Since overall decrease in alpha power indicated
increasing demands of attention, alertness, and task
load in general [18], the hard-to-comprehend signs
could be associated with reduced alpha power. As to
the gamma frequency band, higher gamma power was
observed in channels O1 and O2 for the good signs
since the occipital lobe is closely linked with visual
saliency [55] and good signs likely evoke a higher visual saliency than the bad signs. However, it is also
worthy to note that the increased gamma power observed in the visual cortex for the good signs in the
current study might also be caused by other factors,
such as stimulus properties or interindividual differences, which are often the causes of diverse findings
in brain oscillation-related studies [50].
It was hypothesized in our study that differences between signs with different comprehensibility levels
would exist only in specific brain regions related to visual stimuli processing and cognitive performance.
Therefore, to prove this hypothesis, additional analysis
was done for channels T7 and T8 located on the auditory cortex, which were supposed to be related with
auditory stimuli processing [56]. The result showed no
significant difference between the two groups of signs.
This finding supported our hypothesis that spatial analysis focusing on brain regions related to attention, cognitive, and visual stimuli processing was an efficient
approach to analyze brain oscillatory phenomena when
comprehending the symbolic signs.
In coherence to cognitive processing of visual stimuli,
laterality is one aspect that often draws interests. In this
study, the brain oscillations in the delta, theta, alpha,
and gamma tend to be more prominent in the right
hemisphere of the visual cortex (O1 and O2). This result
is relevant when compared to the previous studies,
which mentioned that the right hemisphere of the human brain is specialized for information related to perception of a global shape, while the left hemisphere is
specialized to process more detailed information, for example, when two or more modalities were involved [57].
Another study by Goldberg and Costa [58] also mentioned that the right hemisphere has a greater ability to
process novel stimuli. It is noteworthy to mention that
the tasks administered in the current study were
stimulus-driven (bottom-up) and the obtained laterality
pattern may differ when (1) instruction-driven tasks
(top-down) are also incorporated into the experiment
and (2) two or more modalities are incorporated into
the experiment [59].

There are several limitations inherent in the current
study. Firstly, the significant results obtained for several
physiological measures investigated in this study were
elicited by signs which had been proven to be very different in terms of comprehensibility level (easy to comprehend vs. hard to comprehend). Whether or not the
significant measures found in this study can reflect human attention and cognitive processes elicited by signs
whose comprehensibility levels are in between is definitely worthy of further investigation. Secondly, the stimuli used in the present study were traffic signs, and they
were tested with young participants; whether the findings from this study can be generalizable to other types
of safety signs and other populations should be studied
in the future. Thirdly, a simple two-group comparison
(easy-to-comprehend vs. hard-to-comprehend signs) is
used in this study to provide some preliminary evidences
that signs of different comprehensibility could induce
some changes on simultaneously recorded physiological
data. A further study with the addition of a control condition of “no sign” could be conducted to compare with
sign conditions so that the effect of displaying sign stimuli on human physiological differences can also be examined. The last, but not least, advanced analysis
techniques should be developed to link eye movement
to the ongoing EEG for giving more information about
what regions of the brain are activated while people engage in sign comprehension.

Conclusions
This study investigated eye movements and brain oscillations to symbolic traffic signs with different comprehensibility. Results showed that the comprehensibility level
of traffic signs significantly affects eye movements and
EEG spectral power. The harder to comprehend the sign
is, the slower the blink rate, the larger the pupil diameter, and the longer the time to first fixation. Noticeable
differences on EEG spectral power between easy-tocomprehend and hard-to-comprehend signs can be
observed in the prefrontal and visual cortexes of the human brain.
Taken together, these findings demonstrate the potential to integrate physiological measures from eye movements and brain oscillations with existing evaluation
methods in assessing the comprehensibility of the symbolic safety signs. Real-time nonintrusive monitoring of
human attention and the brain’s spontaneous electrical
activity may enable researchers a deeper and advanced
understanding the underlying cognitive processes that
affect sign comprehension.
