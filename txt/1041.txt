Abstract. In a previous study (unpublished), Emotiv headset was validated for capturing event-related potentials (ERPs)
from normal subjects. In the present follow-up study, the signal quality of Emotiv headset was tested by the accuracy rate of
discriminating Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) patients from the normal subjects. ERPs of 22 MDD patients and 15
normal subjects were induced by an auditory oddball task and the amplitude of N1, N2 and P3 of ERP components were
specifically analyzed. The features of ERPs were statistically investigated. It is found that Emotiv headset is capable of
discriminating the abnormal N1, N2 and P3 components in MDD patients. Relief-F algorithm was applied to all features for
feature selection. The selected features were then input to a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier with leave-one-out
cross-validation to characterize the ERP features of MDD. 127 possible combinations out of the selected 7 ERP features were
classified using LDA. The best classification accuracy was achieved to be 89.66%. These results suggest that MDD patients
are identifiable from normal subjects by ERPs measured by Emotiv headset.

1. Introduction
Depression, characterized by having deficits in motivation, concentration and executive functions, is
one of the most common mental disorders. Traditionally, the clinical diagnosis of depression is mainly
based on subjective symptomatology. With the emergence of novel technologies detecting weak biosignals, measurable data could be generated as supporting evidence for diagnosis of Major Depressive

Disorder (MDD).
Event-related potentials (ERPs) are a time locked measure of brain electrical activity. Due to its
objectivity, this measure is well suited to study brain activities and has been applied to subjects
suffered from depression for decades. ERPs is an additive signal from several overlapping components
and subcomponents like N400, Contingent Negative Variation (CNV), mismatch negativity(MMN),
N1, N2 and P3. Many studies have focused on amplitudes, latencies and topographic distributions of
these components [1, 2], especially the N1, N2 and P3 in depressed patients. It is well known that the
characteristics of ERPs represent a distinct pattern of cognitive mechanisms that rely on pre-attentive,
executive and affective processes. To be specific, N1 subcomponent, occurring at around 100 ms poststimulus, is involved in perception or initial sensory processing and also linked to early selective
attention; the N2, occurring at nearly 200 ms post-stimulus, is affected by executive mechanisms; and
the P3, occurring in the range of 270-550 ms, is regarded as an index of allocation of processing
resources, orientation of attention to salient or novel stimuli, memory recall and response modulation.
The amplitudes of N1 and N2 have been proposed as important features associated with depression.
However, there were controversial findings in previous studies. Several studies have reported N1
reductions in depressed subjects [3], but more studies have failed to find distinctive N1 differences
between the depressed patients and the normal controls [4, 5]. Some studies found increased N2
amplitude [6], and others reported no difference [7, 8] or even reduced N2 in depressed subjects [9].
P3 measure, which is used to investigate cognitive deficits in depressed patients, has achieved much
consistent findings, including reduced P300 amplitude and abnormal P300 latency [9].
As to Emotiv system, although comparative studies have reported its poorer fidelity compared with
laboratory EEG recording systems like ANT [10] and Neuroscan [11], it still could provide valuable
information on EEG data. And supporting arguments have been given by a number of researchers who
have successfully applied this system to assess cognitive processes [12-17].
The current study aimed to explore the potential utilization of the Emotiv headset on clinical MDD
patients. To our knowledge, this would be the first report of how Emotiv headset performs on patients.
2. Methods
2.1. Subjects
Participants were all right-handed, literate and without auditory and/or visual impairments. Normal
subjects were recruited from Guilin University of Electronic Technology. Only those who met the
following criteria were designated as the control group: 1) scored less than 10 on Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI, 13 items); 2) no personal or familial history of psychiatric disorders, including
claustrophobia; 4) no history of drug or substance abuse; 5) no history of taking any tranquilizers or
antidepressants; and/or 6) no consumption of coffee or alcohol in the last 24 hours. In sum, fifteen
participants were selected to be the control (7 men and 8 women, aged from 23 to 27 years (25.3±1.1)).
Sixty-six outpatients from Guilin Social Welfare Hospital who received consistent diagnoses of
depression from two professional Psychiatrists based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM-IV) participated in data acquisition. However, twelve of them were in comorbid with
schizophrenia, thirty recrudescent patients had not gone through drug washout period when data
acquisition was performed, one was left-handed, and one’s behavioral response data were missing due
to an operational error, leaving only 22 qualified for the depression group. To match with the control,
15 out of 22 were selected to represent the depression group (7 men and 8 women, aged from 17 to 42

S919

years (30.1±8.0)).
This study was approved by the regional ethics committee of Guilin University of Electronic
Technology and Guilin Social Welfare Hospital. Written approvals were collected from all
participants. Data were anonymized before data analysis.
2.2. Task and procedure
Monotonous stimuli were designed using GoldWave software (www.goldwave.ca/). They were
50ms-long sine waves with frequencies of 500 Hz (standard stimulus, number of appearances = 190)
and 1,000 Hz (standard stimulus, number of appearances = 30). These tones were broadcasted
binaurally in a pseudo-random order. Adjacent appearances of target stimulus were avoided. The interstimulus interval was randomly generated within a range of 800ms to 1,200 ms. To be well prepared,
the subject was instructed to adjust himself to his most comfortable position and put his fingertips on
the basic positions for touch typing. For performing the experiment, the subject was told to make
responses only to the target stimulus by pressing the SPACE button and silently counting the total
appearances of the target stimulus. The procedure was initiated with a practicing session. The subject
was permitted to enter the experimental session only when his response accuracy exceeded 85%.
Every trial started with a visual fixation cross followed by a stimulus tone and ended with a full black
screen. The experimental session lasted for about six minutes.
2.3. Data recording
A research edition of wireless Emotiv EPOC headset (www.emotiv.com) was used.
Electrophysiological data were acquired from 10 channels: F7, F3, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, F4, and F8.
These sensors were placed according to the International 10/20 placement. Electrical resistance was
reduced by saline liquid. Data were online referenced at CMS/DRL, sampled at 128 Hz, bandpass
filtered from 0.2 to 45 Hz, and notched filtered at 50 Hz and 60 Hz.
Behavioral information was recorded synchronously with brain signal data, from which response
accuracy and RT measures were derived. Specifically, response accuracy was determined by the ratio
of the number of correct responses over the number of total target stimuli; RT referred to the time
interval between the target stimulating event and the corresponding response event.
2.4. Data processing
Data were processed under MATLAB environment with the help of functions from EEGLAB
toolbox (http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/) [18]. EOG artifact was reduced using a combined method of
extended informax-ICA (without PCA) and Multiple Artifact Rejection Algorithm (MARA) [19]. Data
were then epoched from -200 ms to 1000 ms and baseline was corrected by referring to pre-stimulus
interval. For epoch rejection, an amplitude threshold of ±75 uv was configured. Across epochs
survived the amplitude screening, and with qualified key-press responses, data were averaged.
For each participant and each component of interest, N1, N2 and P3, individual peak amplitudes and
corresponding latencies across the following three intervals: 70 – 170 ms, 180 – 270 ms and 280 – 550
ms, were extracted from the averaged ERP.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was taken for statistical analyses with alpha value of P < 0.05 as the
significant difference level.

2.5. Feature selection and classification
Liu and Motoda [20] introduced the algorithm of Relief-F for feature selection by which, initiative
instance was randomly chosen and made comparisons with its nearest neighbor, after repetitive
calculations and comparisons, the weights of the relevance among instances were conducted. This
method has become one of the most useful strategies in feature selection. In the present study, the
features consisted of RTs, response accuracy, amplitudes and latencies of N1, N2 and P3 at all ten
electrodes, 62 pieces in total. To eliminate the effect of randomness on initial instance, Relief-F was
run for 20 times and each time on resembled half instances from each group, and the number of the
most important features was estimated according to dataset redundancy criteria. Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA) is a common classification technique. Using all the possible combinations of the
selected features, the classification accuracy of LDA with leave-one-out cross-validation was
calculated.
3. Results and discussion
The control and the depressed group were configured with similar gender ratio. But ages were
significantly different. Thus, the possible effects of gender and age on both behavioral and ERP
measures were also carefully examined by repeat ANOVA tests.
3.1. Behavioral performance
ANOVAs performed on RT between the control and the depressed group (Table 1) showed a
significant difference (F(1,28) = 4.67, p = 0.03). Depressed patients responded to stimuli much slower
than the normal subjects. Response accuracy data were lower in the depressed group in general, but
there was no statistical difference by ANOVA test (F(1,28) = 2.31, p = 0.14). Neither gender nor age
exerted any effect on RT and response accuracy in the control or depressed group.
3.2. Latency and amplitude of ERP component N1, N2 and P3
In N1, the depressed group had shorter latencies than the control group. Repeat ANOVAs revealed a
significant difference at the electrode F3 (F(1,28) = 7.00, P = 0.01), F4 (F(1,28) = 5.35, P = 0.02) and
O1 (F(1,28) = 4.78, P = 0.03), and a tendency of difference at F8 (F(1,28) = 4.15, P = 0.05), but not at
the other six electrodes. Regarding amplitudes of N1, the depressed group generally had lower N1
amplitudes than the control. Significant difference was shown at F4 (F(1,28) = 5.82, P = 0.02), O1
(F(1,28) = 4.90, P = 0.03) and O2 (F(1,28) = 4.72, P = 0.03).
In N2, the latencies of depressed group were not different from the control group by one way
ANOVA. The absolute N2 amplitudes in depressed group were generally higher. However,

S921

statistically significant differences were only seen at electrodes F3 (F(1,28) = 4.88, P = 0.03) and F4
(F(1,28) = 5.80, P = 0.02).
In P3, the depressed group took longer average latencies than the control group at all electrodes, but
statistically significant differences were only presented at F7 (F(1,28) = 6.59, P = 0.01), T7 (F(1,28) =
7.41, P = 0.01), P8 (F(1,28) = 4.27, P = 0.04), O1 (F(1,28) = 7.02, P = 0.01), and O2 (F(1,28) = 7.30, P
= 0.01). Likewise, the depressed group showed increased amplitudes at all electrodes, especially at the
electrodes F4 (F(1,28) = 4.36, P = 0.04), T8 (F(1,28) = 9.77, P = 0.00), P7 (F(1,28) = 10.31, P = 0.00),
P8 (F(1,28) = 7.04, P = 0.01), O1 (F(1,28) = 10.66, P = 0.00), and O2 (F(1,28) = 9.66, P = 0.00).
Gender and age had no significant effects on latencies and amplitudes of N1, N2 or P3.
3.3. Selection and classification of typical features of MDD
Based on the principle of least redundancies, seven features were selected from the 62 features
sorted by Relief-F and shown as follows: 1) amplitude of N1 at electrode F4, 2) amplitude of N2 at F4,
3) amplitude of P3 at O1, 4) latency of N1 at F3, 5) latency of N2 at T7, 6) latency of P3 at T7, and 7)
RT. All the possible combinations based on the above 7 features were tested for classification
accuracies using LDA classifier with leave-one-out cross-validation method. And the results ranged
from the highest classification accuracy of 89.66% with 1 combination, 86.21% with 14 combinations,
and 82.76% with 9 combinations to the lowest 10.34%.
3.4. Discussion
The present study was characterized by the abnormal features of ERPs in depressed patients that
may be applicable for clinical diagnosis as measurable evidence. It is also shown that Emotiv headset
was able to discriminate the abnormal EPRs of MDD patients from the normal subjects. Thus there
would be commercial value to exploit Emotiv headset as a household medical device.
The Emotiv EPOC headset had been scrutinized on normal subjects for its capability in detecting
electrophysiological signals [11, 21]. In the present study, the Emotiv headset was applied to
depressed subjects. Behavioral data indicated that patients with depression took more time to response.

These findings were consistent with the depression symptoms that typically showed patients’ difficulty
in concentration and their indecisiveness. Therefore, the RT was considered as an important
behavioral component for defining the character of depression. In analysis of electrophysiological
signals, prolonged latencies were found in depressed group in ERP components N2 and P3 (Figure 1).
Our findings on latencies were supported by other studies. Urretavizcaya, et al. [9] declared that
latencies in N1, N2 and P3 were all significantly longer in depressed patients than those in the normal
subjects. Reduced amplitudes of N1 and increased amplitudes of N2 and P3 were also revealed in
depressed group (Figure 1). It had been reported that the impairments in selective attention was in
association with weakened N1 in depressed patients [3]. Sur and Sinha [22] also mentioned a negative
relationship between N2 amplitude and persistence score, implicating higher N2 amplitude versus a
lower persistence score. Our results based on data from Emotiv system reached a consensus on these
two findings; however they failed to replicate observations from Urretavizcaya, et al. [9] who had
declared an association between decreased P3 amplitude and major depression.
Among many classification methods, such as support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, naïve
Bayesian algorithms [23, 24], LDA was chosen for the merits of its simple application and of having
been well characterized in other discriminant studies [25]. LDA in current study explicitly attempted
to model the difference between the normal and depressive subjects with the percentage of
classification accuracy to indicate the degree of difference. The classification results showed that the
combination of (1, 3) respectively corresponding to the amplitude of N1 at F4 and amplitude of P3 at
O1 was a very important factor because it not only achieved the highest classification accuracy
(89.66%), but also was presented in 9 out of 15 combinations counted by over 85% classification
accuracy. The combination of (2, 3) also occurred frequently with 8 occurrences in 15 combination
models. Interestingly, feature 1 and feature 2 both happened at frontal F4, which was reported strongly
associated with depression [26]. The site of O1 locates in occipital hindbrain. It is very interesting that
64 combinations above 68.97% comprised feature 3, indicating that the site of O1 may reflect certain
electrophysiological changes relating to depression.
To sum up, the LDA study suggests some significance and implications: 1. The ERPs in MDD
patients display some typical differences from the normal subjects and 7 features are highlighted. 2.
The normal and depressed ERPs captured by Emotiv headset can be analyzed and discriminated using
LDA method. 3. LDA illustrates 15 models of feature combinations with high classification accuracies
in which the abnormal ERP features in MDD patients can be identified by a more precise and accurate
method. Hopefully, the LDA study on data collected by Emotiv headset has implications for
developing some MDD diagnostic products.
