Abstract
This study represents an experimental research based on the electrophysiological evaluation of perceived
complexity in streetscapes. Two physical measurements of perceived complexity, based on RMS contrast
statistics and fractal information, were compared to human judgmental responses issued from brainwaves
using Epoc Emotiv neuroheadset. The results indicated that frequency bands showed significant results
in alpha and beta power bands in occipital and frontal electrodes, respectively. The higher the degree of
familiarity with the streetscape image, the higher the degree of relaxation reflected by the increase of alpha
power. Alpha power increased in dark streetscape images. RMS contrast statistics as well as fractal dimension
values showed a positive correlation with beta band power associated with arousal and attention.
Keywords: perceived complexity; cognitive appraisal; RMS contrast statistics; fractal dimension; electrophysiological responses

1. Introduction
Electrophysiological analysis became recently
popular as a tool of Kansei/affective studies. It has
been used together with other techniques in different
research fields such as architecture, urban environment
studies and environmental psychology.
Different studies investigated the effects of
the degree of complexity of a stimulus on the
electrophysiological responses of participants.
Berlyne and McDonnell (1965) argued that complex
and incongruous visual stimuli produce a long
desynchronization of alpha activity. They emphasized
that arousal positively correlates with the degree
of surprise and novelty in visual stimuli. In the
studies conducted by Christie and colleague (1972),
slideshows containing different numbers of items
(2, 4, 8, 16 and 32) were presented to participants.
Their findings highlighted a negative correlation of
alpha activity with the number of items and a positive
correlation with the level of relaxation. The study of
Matsumoto et al. (2002) focused on the prediction
of emotional changes induced by urban spaces using
data obtained from psychological rating (SD method)

and brainwave measurement. In a development of the
previous study, Matsumoto et al. (2004) developed
a sensitivity analysis system based on VTR and CG
images to grasp the emotional changes induced by
urban spaces in terms of four dimensions of meaning
extracted from the relationship between psychological
quantities and brainwave values.
In this paper, the physiological responses of
participants related to perceived complexity were
examined using electrophysiological analysis EEG in
order to explore any significant relationship between
the intrinsic responses of participants and the visual
structure of the streetscape images.
2. Aims of the Study
The aim of this study was to:
¡ Examine the brain oscillations of participants
while watching different streetscape images with
different complexity levels.
¡ Explore the physiological responses of
participants related to perceived complexity using
electrophysiological analysis.
¡ Investigate the relationship between perceived
complexity and arousal.
Because of time limits, six channels were selected
for data acquisition and processing (F3, F4, P7, P8, O1
and O2). The analysis was carried out with Alpha and
Beta frequencies. Power bands were calculated with
fast-Fourier transform.
3. Physiological and Behavioral Methods
In this study, the aim of physiological signal
measurement is to reflect brain activity and to

identify cognitive and emotional states of human
subjects towards urban streetscapes with different
degrees of complexity. In physiological measurement,
participants are monitored by physiological sensors
that require contact with the human body through
electrolyte sensors (e.g. electroencephalography EEG,
electrocardiography ECG), while others are standoff
sensors (e.g. eye tracking devices).
3.1 The Brain
The brain is the main part of the central nervous
system. Anatomically, it can be divided into three parts,
which are: hindbrain, midbrain and forebrain (Nykopp
2001). Functionally, the brain is divided into three
parts:
¡ The first part is called large brain (forebrain or
cerebrum). It controls higher mental activities such
as analytical thinking and language.
¡ The second part is called brainstem. It is responsible
for the visual and auditory functions.
¡ The third part is the cerebellum. It handles the
motor control and the movement of the limbs and
the body.
The human brain is categorized into four different
lobes, that is to say: frontal, temporal, parietal and
occipital (Fig.1.).

Fig.1. Brain Lobes

The frontal lobe controls complex cognitive actions,
language programs, executive functions, emotions and
behavioral control.
The temporal lobe is used for storing visual memory,
processing language and other audio related functions.
The parietal lobe processes and receives sensory
information by connecting all senses.
The occipital lobe processes all visual information
tasks sent from the eye. It plays also a role in object
recognition.
3.2 Types of Signals
There exist five major brainwave forms distinguished
by their different frequency ranges. These frequency
bands (from low to high frequencies) are called alpha,
theta, beta, delta and gamma.
Delta wave is a large amplitude brainwave with low
frequency, which lies within the range of 0.5~4 Hz. This
wave is associated with deep sleep in normal individuals.

586 JAABE vol.14 no.3 September 2015

Theta wave lies within the range of 4~7.5 Hz. It is
associated with creative thinking and deep meditation.
Alpha wave is a rhythmic oscillation that occurs
between 8~13 Hz. This wave has higher amplitude
compared to other wave types. It is best seen in a
relaxed position with closed eyes.
Beta wave consists of an irregular wave that occurs
at the frequency of 13 to 50 Hz. It can be found in
frontal and central regions of the brain when a person
is involved in mental or physical activities.
Gamma wave has very low amplitude with a rhythmic
activity that occurs to sensory stimuli. It lies within the
range of 30 Hz and higher frequencies.
3.3 Electrophysiological Analysis Process
The process of EEG analysis consists of the
following steps:
¡ Removal of baseline.
¡ Filtering the signal by applying a band-pass filter
(high and low).
¡ Rejecting artifacts such as eye blinks, eye
movements, horizontal eye movements, and muscle
activity.
¡ Analysis of the filtered EEG data.
¡ Classification of the obtained data.
4. Method
4.1 Data Collection
Because of research feasibility, this study could
not cover a large number of cities in both Algeria and
Japan. To avoid generalization of the concepts that
will issue from this research, the authors based the
collection of streetscape images on the idea of selecting
two cities from each country in which the collection
will be carried out. All images were taken during the
summer in two phases. The first phase was carried out
in Algeria between the 17th and 19th of June 2010.
The second phase was carried out in Japan between
the 4th and 5th of August 2010. A total number of 80
pictures were shot in daytime and nighttime. However,
6 pictures were cancelled because of their inadequacy.
Therefore, the dataset was composed of 74 streetscape
images. 37 images were shot in Al-Kantara and Batna
cities. The other 37 images were taken in the cities
of Kyoto and Tokyo (Fig.2.). Within the dataset, 40
images were taken during daylight hours and 34 images
at nighttime using a digital camera Nikon D300S with
Nikkor lens system AF-S DX 35mm f/1.8G. All images
were shot from the right side of each street to avoid
heterogeneity in the vision fields.
The camera was fixed on a tripod in order to avoid
artifacts caused by camera shaking (Fig.3.). ISO
sensitivity was set to 200. Shutter speed and aperture
were set manually for each image, depending on light
conditions, and exposure was set to 0EV. The aim was
to measure perception within the real conditions that
pedestrians encounter in their daily life.
Image files were recorded in uncompressed color
NEF format (Nikon's raw file designation). The size

of the RAW images was 4288 × 2848 pixels and
image quality was 14 bits/pixel. For the ranking
and electrophysiological experiments as well as the
estimation of perceived complexity α, described in the
next sections, images were presented to participants
in a 30" display (model Dell UltraSharp 3008WFP,
color temperature: 6500k, luminance: 120 cd/m2). The
display's highest resolution was 2560×1600 pixels,
which prevented the exhibition of images in RAW size.
Therefore, images were pre-processed by decimation.
This process consisted in low-pass filtering followed
by down sampling of the images by a factor of 2. In
this way, the size of the pre-processed images became
2144×1424 pixels, which can be exhibited on the
display. Finally, decimated images were converted to 8
bit integer arrays so that their pixel's luminance varies
within the range [0, 255].

complexity. Then, they were asked to sort images
inside each group in an increasing order of complexity.
After gathering the ranked data, it was necessary
to represent the divisions among simple, ordinary
and complex categories. These divisions could be
identified by including two more imaginary items, with
additional ranking positions that represent two axes
of separation within the dataset. For example, if the
simple group contained 10 streetscapes, the division
between simple and ordinary categories occupied the
11th position in the ranking. The ranking positions
"i" (where i=1,2,….,76) were scaled down to c-scores
"c(i)".

4.2.1.1 Image Preprocessing
To analyze fractal information in streetscapes,
images in the dataset were transformed into binary
bitmap files (*.bmp) using Sobel algorithm in order to
detect their edges. The process was based on detecting
white edges on a black background.
4.2.1.2 Estimation of Fractal Dimension Db
A key feature of any fractal object is its fractal
dimension, denoted as "D". It measures the degree
of irregularity and fragmentation. It can be measured
according to various methods that depend on the
research problem. However, all these methods
are based on a power law that generates scaleinvariant properties (Taylor et al. 2008). The boxcounting method is one of the most commonly used
mathematical approaches to determine the approximate
fractal dimension of an image because it can measure
images that are not entirely self-similar.
In this study, a large grid was placed over each
streetscape image. Each square in the grid was checked
to determine the existence of white pixels (Fig.4.).
Then, boxes that contain white pixels were recorded. In
the following step, a grid of smaller scale was placed
over the same streetscape image and the same process
was applied in order to search for possible white pixels
(details) in the boxes of the grid. Finally, a comparison
was made between the number of boxes with details in
the first grid and the number of boxes with details in
the second grid. This comparison was made by plotting
a log-log diagram for each grid size. Repeating this
process over multiple grids of different scales produced
a log-log linear correlation between the number of
counted boxes and the associated sizes of the grid. This
study used Benoit 1.3© software, which is based on
the box counting method.
In Benoit software, fractal dimension is defined
as the exponent "D" in the relationship (Kacha et al.
2013a):

Where N(d) is the number of boxes of linear size d,

4.2.2 Contrast Statistics of Streetscape Images
Human capacity to discern information includes
the ability to perceive differences in luminance within
a field of vision. This creates different patterns of
contrast that provide visual information to the viewer.
The definition of image contrast depends on its
application. Various methods of contrast measurement
emerged from each application, that is to say: simple
contrast, Weber contrast, Michelson contrast and RMS
(root-mean-square) contrast.
RMS contrast is defined as the standard deviation of
pixel intensities, commonly applied for non-periodic
targets (noise, textures and images) (Frazor and
Geisler, 2006; Bex et al. 2009). It does not depend on
spatial frequency content neither on spatial distribution
of contrast within an image. It is considered by Levien
(2003) in his study on contrast in natural images, as the
most reliable indicator of visible images. It represents
the most commonly used measure to quantify image
details in image processing systems as well as a
good predictor of the subjective/apparent contrasts of
compound grating images and random noise patterns
(Moulden et al. 1990).
4.2.2.1 Image Preprocessing
Images were transformed from color scales to
grayscale and resampled to 1072 × 712 pixels because

4.3 Electrophysiological Analysis EEG
4.3.1 Participants
Six right-handed participants from the department
of architecture of Nagoya Institute of Technology
voluntarily took part in this experiment. Participants
were three males and three females, all being
approximately the same age (Mean = 23.16 years,
Stand. Dev. = 0.75 years). They all had normal or
corrected-to-normal vision.
4.3.2 Procedure
The experiment was conducted in Japan between
the 23rd of May and 3rd of June 2013. The time of
the experiment was from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm and
from 15:00 pm to 19:00 pm. The order of the picture
flow was the same for all participants. Images were
presented in the same display used in the previous
experiment (model Dell UltraSharpTM 3008WFP 760).
The distance between each participant and the display
was about 100 cm (Fig.6.). To avoid artifacts and
noises in the recording data, participants were asked to
follow the following guidelines during the experiment:
¡ Try to not blink, nor move your eyes or any other
part of your body.
¡ Try to stay relaxed and do not tense up.
¡ Keep your eyes open.

4.3.3 Hardware
This study used the Research Edition of Emotiv
Epoc neuroheadset, which is a non-invasive high
resolution, neuro-signal acquisition and processing
wireless neuroheadset. It contains 14 channels (plus
CMS/DRL references, P3/P4 locations). Channel
names, based on the International 10-20 locations
are: AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6,
F4, F8, AF4 (Fig.10.). The headset connects to the
computer via Bluetooth using a USB dongle (Fig.8.).

4.3.4 Software
The software used with the Emotiv Epoc
neuroheadset was TestBench v1.5.1.2. It records,
processes the data received from the headset, provides
a real-time display of the data and allows the user to
see the EEG data coming in from each sensor. The
program can also display a Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) of any incoming channel and can display the
Delta, Theta, Alpha, and Beta bands (Fig.9.).
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is usually used in
the treatment of signals in order to convert time into
frequencies.

5. Results
5.1 Analysis of Significant Differences among All
Channels for Time Variable
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) in the variable
time (1: daytime, 2: Nighttime) showed a significant
difference at the p<0.05 level for alpha band power in
the right occipital area (O2 channel) F(1,14) = 6.32,
P = 0.02. The alpha band power was larger in the
nighttime compared to the daytime (Fig.11.), which
means that participants showed a more relaxed state
for nighttime streetscape images than for daytime
streetscape images.

Fig.9. FFT Measurements in TestBench Software

4.3.5 Data Acquisition and Processing
EEG signals were recorded for ten seconds per
streetscape image, using only six electrodes from
frontal, parietal and occipital brain lobes, that is to say:
F3, F4, P7, P8, O1 and O3 (the selected channels are
surrounded by a circle in Fig.10.). These signals were
sampled at 250 Hz. After recording the data from all
participants, the data was divided into 16 portions;
each portion represented the obtained signal from
each participant looking into a streetscape image.
Then, power bands were calculated using fast-Fourier
transform (256 points) using Hanning window from
the TestBench software. The analysis was carried out
with alpha (7-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) frequencies.
The analysis was carried out based on the average
of the whole time portions (ten seconds) for each
streetscape image.

5.2 Analysis of Significant Differences among All
Channels for Country Variable
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) in the variable
country (1: Algeria, 2: Japan) showed a significant
difference at the p<0.05 level for alpha band power
in the left occipital area (O1 channel) F(1,14) = 6.5, P
= 0.02. The alpha band power was larger in Japanese
streetscapes compared to Algerian streetscapes
(Fig.12.). This means that participants showed a

relaxed state towards Japanese streetscape images
compared to Algerian streetscape images. This is due to
the familiarity of Japanese participants with Japanese
streetscapes. Algerian streetscapes represented a new
environment for them, which attracted their attention.
5.3 Linear Regression Analysis for Perceived
Complexity "α"
A linear model was performed using the forward
stepwise method. The model explained 49.6% of
accuracy. The predictor importance showed significant
results only with the beta band power of the right
frontal area (F4=0.59), the right occipital area (O2 =
0.37) and the left occipital area (O1 = 0.04).

Dimension "Db"
Linear model was performed using the forward
stepwise method. The model explained 44% of
accuracy. The predictor importance showed significant
results only with the beta band power for the left
frontal area (F3 = 0.57), the right occipital area (O2
= 0.27) and with the alpha band power for the left
occipital area (O1 = 0.17).
5.5 Arousal Beta/Alpha Ratio
Beta waves are linked to an alert state, whereas
alpha waves are linked to a relax state. The beta/alpha
is a ratio that indicates the arousal state of a participant
(Oude Bos 2006). By examining the arousal state, only
one significant difference for country variable was
found at the p<0.05 level in the left occipital area (O1
channel) F(1,14) = 13.82, P = 0.002. The ratio band
power was larger for Japanese streetscapes compared
to Algerian streetscapes (Fig.13.). This means that
participants showed a relaxed state for Japanese
streetscape images compared to Algerian streetscape
images. Fig.14. shows the relationship between arousal
and perceived complexity issued from both RMS
contrast statistics and fractal dimension.
A principal axis factor analysis (PAF) with Varimax
(orthogonal) rotation of the ratio of band power of six
channels of the 16-streetscape images was conducted

on the gathered data from the six participants. An
examination of the Kaiser-Meyer Olkin measure of
sampling adequacy indicated that the sample was
factorable (KMO = 0.65, above of 0.6).
The results of Varimax rotation of the solution are
shown in Table 1. The analysis yielded a two-factor
solution. Four channels from the frontal and the
occipital areas (F3, F4, O1 and O2) were merged into
the same factor and explained 45.54% from the total
of variance, contrary to the parietal area channels (P7
and P8), which explained 19.80% of the variability.
The resulting factor scoring and factor matrix were
classified using cluster analysis (ward method)
(Fig.15.).

6. Conclusion
The aim of this study was to explore the
physiological responses of participants related to
perceived complexity using electrophysiological
analysis.
The experiment was conducted with six participants.
The number of streetscape images in the slideshow
was 16, carefully selected from each group of
complexity (simple, ordinary, complex). The recording
of electrophysiological data was done using EPOC
Emotiv neuroheadset (research edition). The recording
and processing software of EEG data collected from
the headset was TestBench v1.5.1.2.
Because of time limits, six channels were selected
for data acquisition and processing. These channels
were:
¡ F3 and F4 from the frontal brain lobe, which
controls complex cognitive actions, emotions and
behavioral control.
¡ P7 and P8 from the parietal brain lobe, which
controls sensory information.
¡ O1 and O2 from the occipital brain lobe, which
controls visual information.
The analysis was carried out with Alpha and Beta
frequencies. Power bands were calculated with fastFourier transform.
The electrophysiological analysis helped in obtaining
the following results:
¡ Alpha and Beta band powers showed significant
results in the occipital and frontal electrodes,
respectively.
¡ Alpha power increased with the degree of
familiarity of the participant with the streetscape
stimuli. The higher the degree of familiarity, the
higher the degree of relaxation reflected by the
increase of Alpha power.
¡ Alpha power increased in dark streetscape images
(e.g. Nighttime streetscape images).
¡ Because of the association of Beta waves with
arousal and attention, perceived complexity
and fractal dimension values showed a positive
correlation with Beta band power in the frontal
lobe.

The positive correlation between familiarity and
relaxation as well as among contrast, fractal dimension
and Beta band power associated with arousal and
attention reflect the main outlines for future studies
on this subject. In terms of research limitations, the
authors believe that future experiments should include
more participants who are unfamiliar with Algerian
and Japanese streetscapes. Increasing the number of
sessions within the experiments is also recommended.
