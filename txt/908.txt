Abstract—Brain-computer interface (BCI) is currently
developed as an alternative technology with a potential to
restore lost motor function in patients with neurological injuries.
In this paper, we describe an integrated system of a non-invasive
electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI with a non-invasive
functional electrical stimulation (FES). This system enables the
direct brain control of upper limbs to achieve motor
rehabilitation. The EEG signals based on steady-state visual
evoked potential (SSVEP) were used in the BCI. The classifier of
linear discriminant analysis was applied to deal with the
frequency domain characteristics and recognize intentions. The
identified intentions were transformed into instructions to
trigger FES which was controlled with iterative learning control
method to stimulate the relevant muscles of upper limbs for
motor recovery. Results show that the integration of BCI with
an upper-extremity FES is feasible with an average accuracy of
about 73.9% over five able-bodied subjects.

ANY neurological injuries, such as Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy,
brain stroke and spinal cord injury, can lead to lose the ability
to move one’s arm for affected subjects with severe or
complete paralysis. However, the current biomedical
treatments and traditional physiotherapy can provide only a
limited degree of motor function rehabilitation [1]-[3].
Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a relatively alternative
technology with a potential to substitute, augment or restore
lost motor function for patients who suffer from destructive
neurological conditions [4]-[6]. It enables people to control
peripheral environment through using his thoughts or brain’s
electrical activity. Currently, there are many BCI applications
in different areas such as computer cursor control [7], [8],
remote environmental control [9], biometric authentication
[10] and emotion prediction [11]. Most remarkably, BCIs

were applied to control limb prosthetic devices [12], [13], and
such BCI controlled prostheses indicate a feasible
neurological rehabilitation technology for motor function
recovery.
Generally, the BCI control is achieved by acquiring signals
associated with a motor action, processing the signals in
real-time, and subsequently interpreting them into commands.
This procedure has been successfully used to control robotic
arms and functional electrical stimulation (FES) devices [14].
Pfurtscheller’s group [14], [15] was the first one to integrate a
non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI with a
non-invasive FES to control hand grasping for completing a
task of grasping an object and moving it to another place.
Their research was based on motor imagery. Here signals
were acquired during imagined motor responses. Whereas,
this EEG signal processing technology has some deficiencies
such as fewer recognizable motor types or states, lower
recognition rate, longer training time and bigger individual
difference. Moreover, the parameters of FES were fixed.
In this paper, we proposed an integrate BCI-FES system
for implementing upper limbs rehabilitation. To improve the
control performance of FES, a decision and control strategy
was used to produce the required stimulation parameters to
make the upper limb follow the pre-planned trajectory. Dou H
[16], [17] et al. adopted iterative learning control (ILC) into
FES system for the first time. C. T. Freeman [18] et al.
designed an upper extremity motor rehabilitation platform by
applying FES with ILC. We combined ILC with PD feedback
as the control strategy to obtain optimal stimulating control
sequence of the FES. To minimize the need for training prior
to using a BCI, we adopted SSVEP-based EEG signals as the
input of BCI. The robustness of the SSVEP signals can be a
suitable method for a system that integrates a BCI with FES.
The overall works of this paper are organized as follows.
The overall system framework of BCI-FES is proposed in
section II. A detailed SSVEP-based brain computer interface
algorithm and the specified BCI controlled functional
electrical stimulation experiment are given in section III. The
FES based on iterative learning control is presented in section
IV. Finally, some results and conclusions of the integrate
BCI-FES system are drawn and some future work are
proposed.
II. OVERALL SYSTEM FRAMEWORK
The theme of our study is to combine a non-invasive
SSVEP-based BCI with a non-invasive FES for the upper
limbs motor rehabilitation. The structural diagram of the
overall system is shown in Fig. 1. Since the study shows a

2244

validation experiments, it was aimed to able-bodied subjects
who are normally healthy without history of neurological
damage. Five male subjects aged from 23 to 27 were
recruited in this research. All subjects can endure limited
electrical stimulation and provided their informed consent
forms before participating in the experiments.

represents fast speed motor mode, 15 HZ square represents
medium speed motor mode, and 12 HZ square corresponds to
slow speed motor mode. Moreover, the square with no
flickering at the center corresponds to idle state. The
experiment included two phases: the first phase was used to
train SSVEP-based BCI and the second phase was BCI-FES
experiment. We designed 8 runs in every phase. Every run
has 4 trials, including 3 trials of flashing square and 1 trial
with no flickering square, totally 32 trials. In every trial, once
a yellow arrow appeared at the top of red square, the subject
was instructed to focus their attention on the indicated
flashing square. The duration of the flashing square was set to
7 s. The interval time of trials was set to 4 s, so that the
subjects could change their focus to the next indicated target.
In the experiment, the participants should be focused. The
subjects sat in a comfortable seat facing the computer screen
and kept the distance about 40 cm (see in Fig. 3).

III. SSVEP BASED BCI-FES
A. Visual Stimulus
How to determine the visual clues is the extremely
important problem needed to be solved firstly in
SSVEP-based BCI. The visual stimulus can be presented by
using liquid crystal display (LCD)/ cathode ray tube (CRT)
monitors. Because of the stimuli frequencies on the computer
monitor could be limited by the monitor refresh rate, we can’t
select flashing frequency casually. For our monitor with 60
HZ refresh rate in design of visual flashing stimuli, 6.67 HZ,
7.5 HZ, 10 HZ, 12 HZ, 15 HZ and 20 HZ are usually used.
But, the stimulus frequencies affected the system
performance. What’s more, the amplitude of harmonic
frequency could be larger than that of the fundamental
response frequency in SSVEP. As a result, the system cannot
recognize the fundamental frequency and harmonic
frequency, such as 10 HZ and 20 HZ. Therefore, in our
experiment, we choose three stimulus frequencies, 20 HZ, 15
HZ and 12 HZ. According to the three frequencies, we
designed three stimulators which flashed between black and
red color. The shape and the distribution of the stimulator are
shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2. The distribution of three visual stimulators. The shape of the
stimulator is square. It flashes between black and red. The square at the
top center represents 20 HZ flickering frequency. The left square
represents 15 HZ flickering frequency, the right square represents 12 HZ
flickering frequency.

B. Experimental Protocol of BCI-FES
These three flashing square were mapped to different speed
motor modes of upper limb. Respectively, 20 HZ square

Fig. 3. The integrated BCI-FES system. The used EEG acquisition
device was EPOC headset. The FES device was MotionStim8. The
visual stimulator was provided by computer screen.

As shown in Fig. 3, we added FES device on the basis of
the first phase. The stimulating control sequences of FES for
three modes were provided by section IV. The stimulating
electrodes of the FES were positioned at the relevant muscles
and stimulate the muscles to execute motors with different
speed modes. When the subject focused on one of the three
squares, the intention of the individual was recognized by the
BCI algorithm. This intention was transformed into advanced
command and this command triggered the FES to generate
the optimal pulse width sequence of relevant mode to
implement motor.
C. BCI Algorithm
The key technology in a BCI system is EEG processing
algorithm. Generally, we regarded it as a pattern recognition
task. The EEG processing algorithm included signal
acquisition, signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and
classifier design.
1) Signal Acquisition: To minimize the preparation time
and workload, we adopted a consumable and high-fidelity
EEG device, the Emotiv EPOC EEG heasdset. It has 14 data
collecting channel and 2 reference electrodes (see in Fig. 3).
The distributions of electrodes are placed on the scalp roughly
according to the international 10-20 system. The headset is
connected to the computer using a Bluetooth interface and
does not need a separate amplifier unit which decreases the
cost and increase mobility for the user. The electrodes can
sample signals at the rate of 128HZ.

2245

2) Signal Preprocessing: The preprocessing includes
temporal filtering and spatial filtering. The raw EEG signals
were filtered above 2 HZ, with a fifth order Butterworth filter.
We adopted the method of common spatial patterns (CSP) as
our spatial filtering. Generally, the idea of CSP algorithm is to
design a linear combination of the channels that lead to new
temporal signals whose variances are optimal for the
discrimination of two class signals. Let A denote the
single-trial EEG data, the dimensionality of A is N × M ,
where N is channel numbers and M is sample number of
every channel. The normalized covariance matrix of A can
be computed from
AAT
(1)
C=
.
tr ( AAT )
Where T represents the transpose operator and tr (•) is the
trace of a matrix. The covariance matrix of each class is
calculated as C1 and C2 . The sum spatial covariance matrix
Rsum is factorized into the result of eigenvectors and
eigenvalues.

Rsum = C1 + C2 = U λU T

(3)

The C1 and C2 are transformed by whitening matrix as

S1 = PC1PT , S2 = PC2 PT .

(4)

The S1 and S2 possess common eigenvectors, for example,
if

S1 = Bλ1BT

D. Evaluation of BCI Algorithm
Traditionally, we consider classification accuracy
important when evaluating the performance of a BCI. In
other word, an ideal SSVEP-based BCI should be sensitive to
real SSVEP response. Information transfer rate (ITR) is also a
very important index to evaluate the performance of a BCI.
The formula is given as
1− p
). (9)
ITR = log 2 N + p log 2 p + (1 − p ) log 2 (
N −1
Where N represents the number of identifiable class (i.e., the
number of flickering square at different frequencies in our
experiment); p is the classification accuracy. The unit of ITR
is usually given in bits per minute (bpm).

(2)

The eigenvalues are sorted in descending order in λ . Then the
whitening matrix is formed as

P = λ −1U T .

each LDA was the logistic function of all the inputs,
indicating the likelihood that the corresponding flashing
square was being attended. A voting scheme was used, such
as if the majority of the three LDA outputs agree on one
flashing square, a decision was obtained indicating that
square was being focused.

IV. ILC BASED FES
A. Neuromuscular Model
The aim of FES based on iterative learning control is to
find an optimal pulse width (PW) sequence to stimulate the
muscle pair via the stimulator in order to drive the
musculoskeletal segment to track the desired joint angle and
angular velocity. For the purpose of simulation studies, a
neuromuscular dynamic model was provided in this paper.
This skeletal dynamic model which consists of a pair of FES
agonist-antagonist muscles was proposed by Abbas J. J. et al.
[19]. The detailed skeletal dynamics are formulated as
2

Then

S 2 = Bλ2 BT

(6)

λ1 + λ2 = I

(7)

where I is the identity matrix. Because the sum of two
corresponding eigenvalues is always one, the eigenvector
with largest eigenvalue for S1 has smallest eigenvalue for S2
and vice-versa. Taking out the first k columns and the last k
columns of B as B1 , we can construct the optimal spatial
projection matrix as

W = B1T P.

(8)
In our study, the filter dimension was setting 2. Then, the data
of 14 channels was projected to two-dimensional space.
3) Feature Extraction: For SSVEP response, we focused
on the frequency domain of signals. We extracted the power
spectrum in our interesting frequency band, respectively
19.75-20.25 HZ for 20 HZ flashing frequency, 14.75-15.25
HZ for 15 HZ flashing frequency, 11.75-12.25 HZ for 12 HZ
flashing frequency. For a single-trial data (7 s length), we
applied a 0.1 s sliding window to extract features. The length
of window is 0.5 s.
4) Classifier Design: For each class of SSVEP
corresponding to every flashing frequency, we designed a
linear discrimination analysis (LDA) classifier. The output of

B. Control Strategy
From the usual observation, the most human limb
movements are repetitive. The control strategy of FES can
utilize this repeatability to improve the control performance
of the FES system. ILC is especially suitable for task which is
to be executed repeatedly. In our study, we integrated the ILC
with a PD feedback as the control strategy. The block diagram
of the control strategy was shown in Fig. 5. The ILC
feedforward controller is used for the performance

The simulation results of slow mode, medium mode, and
fast mode are shown in Fig. 6 respectively. It can be easily
seen that the angular errors and angular velocity errors
decrease monotonously with the increase of iteration numbers.
It suggested that the ILC with PD feedback algorithm was
convergent. The mean squared errors (MSE) of angular error
for slow mode, medium mode and fast mode are 0.0020,
0.0034 and 0.00041 respectively. Therefore, the control
strategy of ILC with PD feedback controller can track the
desired trajectory with different speed effectively.

The experiment condition consists of extern skeletal
supporter with angle sensor, Advantech PCI-1716 data
acquisition card, and MotionStim8 FES stimulator. In
experiment procedure, the subjects executed slow, medium,
and fast speed motor mode respectively. The angle sensor
recorded the relevant data as the desired trajectory. The
stimulating frequency and intensity of FES were fixed to 125
HZ and 20 mA, respectively. In order to ensure the security
for the individuals, the pulse width is limited by (20).

cross line shows the given desired trajectory to be iteratively
tracked, while the red solid lines show the trajectories in
various ILC iterations. Accordingly, the control sequences of
FES in various iterations were shown in the bottom plot. The
optimal control sequence was selected according to the
minimum error in various ILC iterations. From the Fig. 7, the
error of iteration number 9 is the minimum value. The optimal
tracking trajectory and control sequence can be acquired for

A. Offline BCI Training Results
A method of 10-fold cross validation was used to obtain
an optimal LDA classifier. Because of each LDA was a
one-versus-the-rest discriminator, we can get three LDA
classifier for each subject. The average accuracy results and
the average ITR of the five subjects were presented in Table
III. The average accuracy of three LDA classifiers is achieved
more than 73%. The average ITR of five subjects was
27.54±5.78 bits/min. The effectiveness of the EEG
processing algorithm and the availability of the BCI system
were fully verified. Furthermore, the performance of the
trained LDA1 was generally better than other classifiers.
That’s a reason that the flashing square of 20 HZ can induce
SSVEP response preferably and more stably. Based on S3 and
S5, they had little worse performance for LDA3 when gazing
12HZ flashing square, respectively 73.17% and 74.55%. The
corresponding frequency band of SSVEP (11.75-12.25 HZ)
was overlapped with alpha band (8-13 HZ). Some subjects
with stronger alpha wave may lead to worse performance in
recognizing 12 HZ flashing square of this SSVEP-based BCI.

B. Online BCI-FES Experimental Results
As stated in the previous section, the outputs of
SSVEP-based BCI were transformed to commands by a
voting decision. According to the commands, the ILC-based
FES generated the optimal pulse width sequence of relevant
speed mode to implement more precise motor. In this
BCI-FES experiment, the subjects gazed the flashing red
square with relevant flickering frequency according to the

instruction of the yellow arrow appeared at the top of it. In
online experiment, subjects were instructed to perform three
speed modes of motions, respectively slow mode, medium
mode, and fast mode. In each mode, the subject performed
arm up and down repeatedly. Similarly, we computed the
performance of online identification and motors
implementation for five subjects (see Table IV).

The performance obtained in online BCI-FES demonstrate
that the integrate system is feasible. In the process of practical
experiments, various interference factors including
environmental factor and loose electrode of EPOC headset
can affect the recognition rate of online BCI. These factors
led to the decrease of performance of online experiment. The
performance of S4 is worse than others. This may be caused
by not focusing his attention on the flashing squares.
Moreover, the instability of EEG signals also directly affects
the recognition rate of SSVEP response. Thereby, it will
affect the performance of BCI-FES system. For BCI, the
individual variations are an inevitable problem. We should try
to reduce these variations.

In this paper, an integrated system of a non-invasive
electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI with a non-invasive
functional electrical stimulation (FES) was developed. The
core technology of BCI used a SSVEP response elicited by
stimulation of flashing red square. These advanced
commands are generated by SSVEP-based BCI which detects
three frequencies, 20 HZ, 15 HZ, 12 HZ, when the subjects
are focusing their attention on the flickering square. To
improve the control performance of FES, an integrated
iterative learning control (ILC) with PD feedback was used to
produce the optimal stimulating sequence to make the upper
limb track the pre-planned trajectory. The simulation and
experimental results show that the integrate ILC+PD control
strategy can tracking a desired trajectory at a certain precision.
The performance of this system is robust, achieving
accuracies of over 70% in a group of five individuals.
