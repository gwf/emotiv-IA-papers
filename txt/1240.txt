Abstract. This paper proposes a portable brain-computer interface paradigm and builds a portable braincomputer interface device suitable for brain-controlled wheelchairs.According to the characteristics of Emotiv EPOC equipment and its collected EEG,the hardware system of brain-controlled wheelchair was
developed,and a real-time detection system of brain-controlled technology was built,which is used to collect
EEG signals in real time to realize the wheelchair's motion control.Experimental results show that the
accuracy of EEG control can meet the engineering application requirements.

1 Introduction
Brain Computer Interface (BCI),also known as direct
neural Interface or brain-machine interface[1],is an
important research field of biomedical engineering in
recent years.By extracting specific bioelectrical signals
from the brain and decoding them effectively according
to the existing theories of cognitive neuroscience,it
establishes a direct connection channel between human
or animal brains(or the culture of brain cells)and the
external instruments or devices to control their
movements[2].
It has been a dream of human beings since ancient
times to communicate with the outside world directly
with the signals of mind activity and realize the control
of the surrounding environment.Since the first recording
of the EEG by Hans Berger in 1929[3],it has been
speculated that it might be used for communication and
control, allowing the brain to act directly on the outside
world without the usual medium - peripheral nerves and
limb.However,due to the limitations of the overall
technological level at that time and the lack of
understanding of the brain's thinking mechanism,little
progress has been made in this area.With the
improvement of people's understanding of the function
of nervous system and the development of computer
technology,the research of BCI technology shows an
obvious upward trend,especially the two BCI
international conferences held in 1999 and 2002,which
have pointed out the direction for the development of
BCI technology[4].At present,BCI technology has
attracted the attention of many scientific and
technological workers in the world and is a new research
hotspot in biomedical engineering,computer technology
and communication[5].
This paper mainly will investigate a human-machine
interaction mode with friendly interface,propose a
portable brain-machine interface paradigm,and build a
aCorresponding

portable brain-machine interface device suitable for
brain-controlled wheelchairs.Secondly,the hardware
development of the brain-controlled wheelchair will be
carried out,the real-time detection system of the braincontrolled technology is set up,the adaptive coordinated
control system of the motor is constructed,and the
corresponding control strategy is also studied.Finally,the
experiment for testing E-motiv EPOC and brain
electrical signal characteristics,the experiment for brain
control wheelchair is done so as to obtain good control
ability,respectively.

3 Hardware design on brain control
wheelchair
3.1 EEG recorder
As you know,the EEG signal is composed of Beta
wave,Gamma wave,Alpha wave,Theta wave and Delta
wave[6].In general, electroencephalogram (EEG)
recording of radio signals is performed by EEG medical
grade headset as shown in Figure2(a).For brain control
wheelchair,a wireless portable EPOC headset of Emotiv
company is presented to collect EEG signals as shown in
Figure2(b).Emotiv's EPOC is a wireless portable EEG
device with 14 channels,high spatial resolution,dense
record array,high quality,raw EEG data,designed in line
with actual needs,and is the most credible and costeffective wireless mobile EEG device on the market at
present.It measures electrical activity in the brain
through electrodes placed on the scalp,collecting
electrical potential from the activity of nerve cells,these
low potentials,which are then amplified and converted to
graphics.

Figure3.Arduino UNO board

3.4 Actuator
To execute the command,two brushless motors are
used.They are controlled by two motor controllers
ZD6716V3,so as to control the speed and the rotation
direction of the motors as shown in Figure4.In each
motor,there is a Hall sensor, providing a speed signal
feedback from the motors,to know concretely the speed
of each one.

3.2 Processing of EEG data
To process the raw EEG data provided by the EPOC,a
commercial laptop is used to run under Windows8 64 bit
with a processor Intel®Core™ i5-3230M,a memory of
4096 DDR3 RAM (1 600MHz) and a graphic card AMD
Radeon™
HD7670M
Graphics(2GB
dedicated
memory).During all the experiment it should be paid
attention that all the application running on the computer
use less than 50% of the processor and memory
capacity.So it is sure that no slow in the EEG processing
will occur.

3.5 Design result
Once all the components are assembled,the hardware
design result is shown in Figure5.

3.3 Arduino UNO
For this application,Arduino UNO is chosen as the
microcontroller as shown in Figure3.The microcontroller
will act as an interface between the computer
communicating by USB and the motor controller of the
wheelchair.Arduino UNO is simple,easy to use and
economical.At 16 MHz clock speed,it is much faster
than the system needs and meets the use
requirements.And its sticker price is even less than $8[7].

4.1 Schedule design of software part
The user's EEG is recorded by the EEG EPOC
headset,and the original signal is filtered and amplified
by the proprietary software,which provided by the EEG
EPOC headset.Then the special software carries on the
pattern recognition to the EEG signal,detects the user's
movement thought.Once the EEG is decrypted,the
results will be sent through the API to the personal
software.The software was developed to collect
corresponding instructions according to the decrypted
EEG.The command is then sent to the wheelchair via
Arduino.The brain control software flow chart as shown
in Figure6.

4.3 Command
Once the EEG signal has been decrypted by the
EmoEngine,the decrypted data are available through the
EmoEngine
Application
Programming
Interface(API).An informatics program is designed using
the EmoEngine data through the API to issue commands
for the wheelchair.The interest of such program is to
expand dramatically the capacity of the EPOC,there is
no more constraint induced by a proprietary
program,everything is possible,it just need to be coded.
Every data of the EPOC can be used at the same time
and personal algorithm or filter can be developed to
issue proper commands.With a personal program the
process is also entirely under control and fully
understandable.
4.4 Design results and analysis
The operation of the software part and the relations
between the different programs are resumed as shown in
figure8.

Figure6.The brain control software flow chart

4.2 Processing of raw EEG input
The data collected by the EPOC are transferred by an
encrypted channel.After a proprietary software call
EmoEngine is provided with the EPOC to process and
decrypt the raw EEG data.The EmoEngine also provides
the battery level of the EPOC,the contact quality of each
electrode,the quality of the wireless signal,the gyro data
on two axis.For researcher version of EmoEngine,it’s
also possible to visualize the raw EEG data and record
them.Emotiv also provide some software to visualize and
use the data such as the Control Panel to visualize the
processed data,EmoKey to link the processed EEG data
with a key stroke.
But the more important for the project is the C++
Application Programming Interface (API) provided by
EmoEngine to develop personal application,as shown in
Figure7.The EmoEngine decrypt the EEG data and make
the processed data accessible for every application
running on the computer through the API.To help the
development of new application,Emotiv provides
examples using C++,Java,NET,and Mat Lab language.

Figure8.Functional diagram of personal software

Using directly the EmoEngine information through
the API,the software is really effective and
reactive.Between the reception of the user action by
EmoEngine and transmitting the command to the motor
controller,it takes less than 50 ms.

circuit requesting the more change of direction,it is just
67% slower than the time of reference established with
the joystick.

Before controlling the wheelchair, we have to determine
which EEG data is the more reliable. The users is
comfortably seated on a chair, his feet lay on the floor
and his hand on the armrests, as shown in Figure9. He is
asked during all the experiment to move as little as
possible. The helmet is carefully placed on his head
following the instruction of the EPOC manual. This is
really critical to have reliable and repeatable results,
therefore a special attention is also paid to this step.

6 Conclusions
The results show that the portable brain-computer
interface designed in this paper is a simple and effective
brain-computer interface device,and the accuracy of
EEG control can meet the engineering application
requirements.At the same time, the system has a high
cost performance and costs about $500,which is suitable
for industrial development.

To see if clench, smirk left/right are suitable to
control the system, the graphic power versus time are
plotted for two experiments (20 s) and for each action, it
is appropriate for user 1 and 2 to grasp the threshold of
0.015, but for user 3, the detection ability is good, but it
is constant, so the threshold of 0.003 is more appropriate.

The experimental results show the control mode
using accelerometer is much easier to use.Note that the
number of off-track and shock for all control modes and
circuit are close to zero.The design is completely
validated by the results of this experiment,the user has a
good control of the wheelchair and the speed is
satisfactory.For the slowest mode control and for the
