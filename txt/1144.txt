Consumers frequently make decisions about how much they are willing to pay (WTP)
for specific products and services, but little is known about the neural mechanisms
underlying such calculations. In this study, we were interested in testing whether
specific brain activation—the asymmetry in engagement of the prefrontal cortex—would
be related to consumer choice. Subjects saw products and subsequently decided
how much they were willing to pay for each product, while undergoing neuroimaging
using electroencephalography. Our results demonstrate that prefrontal asymmetry in
the gamma frequency band, and a trend in the beta frequency band that was
recorded during product viewing was significantly related to subsequent WTP responses.
Frontal asymmetry in the alpha band was not related to WTP decisions. Besides
suggesting separate neuropsychological mechanisms of consumer choice, we find that
one specific measure—the prefrontal gamma asymmetry—was most strongly related to
WTP responses, and was most coupled to the actual decision phase. These findings
are discussed in light of the psychology of WTP calculations, and in relation to the
recent emergence of consumer neuroscience and neuromarketing.

INTRODUCTION
How do we decide how much we are willing to pay for a product? What are the basic mechanisms
underlying such computations? In economics and the consumer sciences, one central concept
in this regard is the Willingness To Pay (WTP), defined as the maximum amount of resources
that a consumer is willing to give up in exchange for an object or service being sold (O’Brien
and Viramontes, 1994; Homburg et al., 2005). Research has linked WTP to the evaluation to
subsequent consumer motivation and real consumption choice in as diverse consumer choices as
health services (Olsen and Smith, 2001), organic and healthy food products (Misra et al., 1991),
country of origin effects (Loureiro and Umberger, 2003), and products that are either seen as
environmentally friendly or otherwise ethically sound (Ozanne and Vlosky, 1997; Vlosky et al.,
1999; De Pelsmacker et al., 2005).
Despite the study of WTP in such a variety of situations, little is known about the underlying
neural or psychological processes of these calculations. Recent calls for an improved understanding
of the basic mental mechanisms underlying WTP calculations have proposed to include
neurobiological explorations of how the brain calculates values and instigates choice behavior.

frequency, our results show that gamma frequency and beta
frequency can have equal or even stronger relationship to choice
behavior.

Still, in spite of the rapidly expanding research fields of
neuroeconomics (Rolls, 2000; Camerer et al., 2005, 2016;
Kenning and Plassmann, 2005; Rustichini, 2005; Kable and
Glimcher, 2009; Wilhelms and Reyna, 2014; Levy and Glimcher,
2016), neuromarketing or consumer neuroscience (Ariely and
Berns, 2010; Fisher et al., 2010; Plassmann et al., 2012, 2015;
Smidts et al., 2014; Ramsøy, 2015; Hsu, 2017; Lee et al.,
2017). In these multidisciplinary efforts, any exact understanding
of the neural or psychological mechanisms underlying WTP
calculations is still woefully lacking (Plassmann et al., 2012). In
a study by Plassmann et al. (2007) it was found that activation
in both the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and
the right dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) demonstrated a significant
relationship to subjects’ WTP. However, as the researchers noted,
the exact role of the OFC and dlPFC in the calculation of WTP
could not be determined. Notably, the authors speculated that
based on the different connectivity that the two brain regions
have, the multisensory nature of OFC could point to a role in
the immediate valuation of items (Rolls, 2000, 2004), while the
dlPFC could be more involved in the execution of choice behavior
(Petrides and Pandya, 1999). More recent accounts also support a
dissociation between value calculation and choice execution (and
choice conflict) between the OFC and regions such as the ACC
and dlPFC (Plassmann et al., 2010; Rushworth et al., 2012).
The study reported here was set up to explore the possible
role of prefrontal hemispheric differences in computing WTP.
The notion that the computation of WTP may rely on a
diverse contribution from the two hemispheres is rooted in a
growing body of work demonstrating a prefrontal asymmetry
in relationship to approach and avoidance behaviors. The
main findings emerging from this research are that approach
behaviors are related to a relative stronger engagement of
the left PFC compared to the right PFC (Pizzagalli et al.,
2005), and that such effects are mainly due to motivation
and not valence (Harmon-Jones and Allen, 1998). The lefthemispheric dominance for approach behaviors has also been
suggested in studies of consumer choice (Ravaja et al., 2012),
as well as advertising (Ohme et al., 2009, 2010). However,
there is still conflicting evidence with regard to the hemispheric
asymmetry model (Spielberg et al., 2008), and studies on
the inverse effect of stronger relative engagement of the
right compared to left PFC in avoidance behavior has been
less consistent (Harmon-Jones and Allen, 1998). Interestingly,
in the Plassmann et al. study we cited above (Plassmann
et al., 2007), although the subjects were not explicitly tested
for prefrontal asymmetry, the increased activations in the
vmPFC and dlPFC were exclusively located in the right
hemisphere.
In the present study, by asking subjects to watch images
of different products while prefrontal asymmetry was assessed
using electroencephalography (EEG), we find that a prefrontal
laterality index obtained during passive product viewing is highly
related to subsequent WTP reports. Notably, while prior EEG
studies have focused on prefrontal asymmetry effects using alpha

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sixteen women (age range 19–51, mean/std = 27.1/8.2, all right
handed) were recruited using both online (www.forsoegsperson.
dk and www.videnskab.dk) and direct recruitment procedures.
The study reported here was part of a larger cohort study on
compulsive consumption (n = 63), but for the present study
we only included subjects who did not meet diagnostic criteria
for compulsive consumption, or the preclinical compensatory
consumption stage, as assessed by the Compulsive Buying
Scale (Faber and O’Guinn, 1992). All subjects read and
signed an informed consent, and were initially informed
and trained with the experimental procedure. The study was
approved by the local ethics committee (at Copenhagen Business
School) and abided to the regulations of the Declaration of
Helsinki.

Experimental Design
Subjects were placed in front of a screen running with a 1,920 ×
1,200 pixel screen resolution, and were placed at an approximate
distance of 60 cm from the screen. During the test, subjects first
saw a fixation cross for 3 s, followed by an image of a product
from one of four categories; bags, clothes, women’s shoes, and
fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG). The individual product
was shown for 3 s, after which asked to report how much they
would like to pay for the product, using an on-screen visual
analog scale ranging from zero to 2,000 Danish Kroner (≈$330).
The experimental design is illustrated in Figure 1. In total, each
participant was exposed to 40 trials, 10 trials in each product
category (bags, clothes, FMCG, shoes). To increase the external
validity of the test, subjects were instructed that the choices
from two of the subjects from the cohort would be randomly
selected and given 1,500 DKK each, and that five of each subject’s
choices would be randomly selected, and the product receiving
the highest bid of those five would be realized. Should the highest
bid not amount to 1,500 DKK, they would be paid the remaining
amount in cash. This meant that subjects were motivated to
optimize their product choices, which allowed us to better
estimate the actual WTP, instead of subjective estimates of WTP.
While this approach allowed the opportunity for participants to
employ certain decision strategies such as selecting the minimally
possible difference in price to signify preference (e.g., 2 DKK for
the preferred item, relative to 1 DKK for non-preferred items)
and retain the remaining amount in cash, no such strategy was
found in the WTP choices made. In total, 640 observations were
made (16 participants, 40 WTP decisions each).
Since the WTP scores were not normally distributed
(Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Lilliefors test D = 0.276, p < 0.01), we
chose to log transform the WTO score to achieve normal
distribution of the WTP data, thus providing a logWTP score
(producing a normal distribution of KSL test D = 0.071,
p = 0.201), which we used in all analyses.

FIGURE 1 | Experimental design. Subjects first saw a fixation cross for 3 s, followed by a product with accompanying brand information for 3 s. The product image
was accompanied by the brand name of the product. Finally, subjects chose the amount of money (Danish kroner) they were willing to pay for the product using a
visual analog scale, and in a self-paced manner.

Neuroimaging

For each electrode alpha, beta and gamma frequencies were
included in the analysis. The prefrontal asymmetry index (PAI)
was calculated by subtracting the values from the AF4 (right
prefrontal) electrode from the AF3 (left prefrontal) electrode, and
divided by the sum of the two electrodes. This is illustrated by the
following formula:

Neural responses were recorded using a wireless 14 channel
headset (Emotiv EPOC Inc.) with a sampling rate of 128 Hz
(bandwidth = 0.2–43 Hz, digital notch filters at 50 and 60 Hz,
and with built-in digital 5th order Sinc filter) and electrodes
positioned at AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6,
F4, F8, AF4 (the 10–20 system, see Figure 2). The headset
was connected to a PC running Windows 7 and transmitted
data wirelessly to a USB receiver module. Stimulus presentation
and data collection for behavioral responses and neuroimaging
data was performed using Attention Tool 4.5 (iMotions, www.
imotionsglobal.com).
Offline data processing was carried out using the EEGLAB
toolbox in Matlab. Baseline correction was performed on the
entire recording to minimize potential drifts of electrodes.
To avoid influence of bad channels affecting the analysis,
the quality of each electrode was evaluated during the whole
recording. Channel quality was provided for each sample with
the Attention Tool 4.5 software with a categorization between 1
and 4 corresponding to no connection (poor) to good contact,
respectively. In the analysis we declared an electrode as bad if
the channel quality did not fulfill a criterion of having minimum
95% good channel quality during the whole recording. Bad
channels were rejected from further analysis. In this study, we
observed an average signal quality of 84.42 ± 0.20 st.dev percent,
with some channels providing 100% average signal quality (AF3,
F7, T7, and F8) while other channels produced the lowest
average signal quality, and with large variation across individuals
(average ± st.dev: O1 = 46.92 ± 49.91%, O2 = 41.06 ± 49.19%).
The channels of most interest for this study produced signal
quality well above acceptable levels (F3 = 82.40 ± 38.08%,
F4 = 94.13 ± 23.50%). Only participants with valid data for the
F3 and F4 electrodes were used in the study.
Power spectra were calculated on each electrode using
windows of 50 samples (i.e., 390 ms) with a 80% overlap
and a frequency resolution of 1 Hz. The power spectra were
reduced to frequency bands in accordance with the alpha, beta,
and gamma frequency bands, defined as alpha [8–13 Hz], beta
[13–25 Hz], and gamma [25–40 Hz]. Each band was calculated as
a summation of the total power within the band.

This means that for gamma (PAIγ ) and beta (PAIβ ) frequencies,
more positive values would be indicative of stronger engagement
of the left PFC, and that more negative values would be
related to relative stronger engagement of the right PFC. The
frontal asymmetry was corrected for overall brain engagement by
dividing the F3/F4 ratio on the sum of both channels (F3+F4).
The alpha frequency has been linked to inhibitory brain function
and is thus assumed to be negatively related to neural activation
levels (Başar et al., 2001; Palva and Palva, 2007). The alpha
measure (PAIα ) has an inverse sign to that of gamma and
beta; thus, more negative values would be indicative of relative
stronger engagement of the left PFC.
We first ran a mixed model with logWTP as the dependent
variable, with the prefrontal asymmetry for each frequency
(PAIα , PAIβ, and PAIγ ) for the aggregate response of the 3 s
product viewing time as independent variables, and with subject
as random factor. To increase the specificity of the prefrontal
activation, all alpha, beta, and gamma electrode values (F7, F3,
FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, and F8) were modeled
as regressors of no interest. This was imposed to increase the
specificity of the frontal asymmetry measure.
Following this, we tested whether the inclusion of product
type would improve the overall explanatory value of the
model. To this end, we ran a new mixed model analysis
with logWTP as the dependent variable, and with product
category (FMCG, clothing, shoes, bags), prefrontal asymmetry
(PAIα , PAIβ , and PAIγ ) and the category∗ PAI interactions as
independent variables, again with subject as random factor.
To record and correct for the degrees of freedom used in
denominator of each test, we use the term “Degrees of Freedom

FIGURE 2 | EEG setup and data types. The electrodes were positioned bilaterally according to the 10/20 system (A) at 14 specific locations (highlighted in green).
From the raw EEG data, Fourier transformation provided alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands, which allowed analysis of prefrontal asymmetry over time in these
three different frequency domains, as exemplified by data from a single subject (B). The (B) plot was achieved by running the PAI analysis on the frequency bands
from 10 to 40 with an increment of 1 Hz (y-axis), and over time with a range from 100 to 3,000 ms with increments of 100 ms (x-axis). The heat map indexes the
prefrontal asymmetry normalized as z-scores. Yellow to red colors denote positive PAI score, while cyan to blue colors denote low PAI scores. Black lines indicate

WTP. The overall model was significant (R2 = 0.267,
RMSE = 0.999, F = 5.37, p = 0.0013). As Table 1 shows,
only PAIγ showed a statistically significant effect, while PAIβ
was trend significant, and PAIα did not produce a significant
result.
Looking at the individual effects, and as shown in Figure 3,
(PAIγ R2 = 0.270, RMSE = 0.996, estimate = 0.161, t = 2.92,
p = 0.0038) was positively related to WTP, i.e., more positive
values were related to higher WTP. Similarly, PAIβ , although
not reaching statistical significance, showed a trend for a
positive relationship to WTP (R2 = 0.273, RMSE = 0.993,
estimate = 0.161, t = 1.67, p = 0.0967), which means that
stronger engagement of the left PFC in beta frequency band was
related to higher WTP. Finally, PAI value in the alpha range
(R2 = 0.276, RMSE = 0.992, estimate = −0.085, t = −1.07,
p = 0.2858) was negatively related to WTP, but did not produce
a significant result. Although not significant, this result lends
support to the frontal asymmetry and WTP, as more negative
PAIα values (i.e., stronger relative engagement of the left PFC,
due to the inverse aspect of the alpha frequency relative to brain
activity) were related to higher WTP scores.
When analyzing PAIα , PAIβ , and PAIγ independently, the
relationship was significantly for PAIβ and PAIγ only (alpha:
t = −1.07, p = 0.286; beta: t = 2.11, p = 0.036; gamma:
t = 3.55, p = 0.0004). Further analyses into the relationship
between the three asymmetry scores demonstrated the following
interrelationships: correlation between alpha and beta: r = 0.286,
p < 0.0001; alpha and gamma: r = −0.132, p = 0.0009; beta and
gamma: r = 0.202, p < 0.0001). In effect, this suggests that we find
a positive relationship between PAIα and PAIβ , and between PAIβ
and PAIγ , while we find a negative relationship between PAIα and
PAIγ .

for the Denominator” (DFDen). The DFDen is calculated using
the Kenward–Roger first order approximation (Kenward and
Roger, 1997), and shows the denominator degrees of freedom for
the effect test (the degrees of freedom for error).
We were interested in testing whether the relationship
between prefrontal asymmetry and WTP would be modulated
by stimulus duration (and, consequently, the time to decision).
We therefore ran a mixed model analysis with logWTP (hereafter
WTP) as the dependent variable, and with time, prefrontal
asymmetry (PAIα , PAIβ , and PAIγ ) and the time∗ PAI interactions
as independent variables, and with subject as random factor.
Finally, to test for other types of EEG responses related
to WTP, we tested the relationship between all electrodes
in the alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands, and their
relationship to WTP, using a mixed model where logWTP was
the dependent variable, each electrode alpha, beta, and gamma
values were used as independent variables, subject was used as
a random factor, and product category as a regressor of no
interest.

RESULTS
Products received an average WTP of 202.25 Danish Kroner
(DKK), but also demonstrated a large variance (STD = 339.36;
range = 0:1627.9 DKK). There was a significant difference
between the four product categories in logWTP score
(R2 = 0.452, F = 41.1, p < 0.0001) that was driven by a
lower logWTP for FMCG (4.51 ± 0.01) than the other product
categories (bags = 6.33 ± 0.01; clothing = 6.03 ± 0.01;
shoes = 5.98 ± 0.01).
In our first mixed model analysis, we tested the effect of
prefrontal asymmetry during product viewing on subsequent

In the second analysis, the main effect of product category
and interactions with the PAI scores were included in the
mixed model analysis. The overall model was highly significant
(R2 = 0.641, F = 19.15, p < 0.0001). As shown in Table 2,
only the category∗ PAI interactions were significantly related
to subsequent WTP. Notably, when category was included in
the analysis, PAIβ showed neither a significant main effect or
interaction with category, while PAIγ showed both a main effect
and interaction effect with category. Looking further into this
interaction effect, we find that PAIγ is significantly positively
related to logWTP for bags (t = 2.38, p = 0.018) and shoes
(t = 1.66, p = 0.845), and that for FMCG there is a significant
negative relationship (t = −2.80, p = 0.006), while clothing did
not show a significant relationship (t = −0.19, p = 0.845).
A control analysis was run to test the added value of
neuroimaging data on product category in explaining WTP. We
first ran a mixed model with product category alone, which
yielded a significant model (R2 = 0.452, F = 79.04, p < 0.0001).
We then included the full model with EEG scores but without
interaction effects, and found that the overall explanatory value
of the model increased (R2 = 0.641, F = 19.15, p < 0.0001),
suggesting that the addition of EEG provided an increase in
explanatory power of WTP. To test whether neuroscience data
provided a significantly improved explanatory power, we ran a
Chow F-test (Chow, 1960) on the pseudo-R values, which yielded
a significant result (F = 1.73, p = 0.0464), suggesting that there
was a significant additional explanatory value of adding the EEG
data to the model.

Our final analysis tested whether the relationship between
prefrontal asymmetry and WTP would be modulated over time.
Our mixed model analysis testing the interaction between time
and PAI scores for each frequency demonstrated a significant
explanatory effect (R2 = 0.299, p < 0.0001) with significant
interaction effects only for the gamma frequency (PAIγ , see
Table 3). As shown in Figure 4, the relationship between PAIγ
and WTP was higher for longer stimulus durations, i.e., the closer
subjects were to making the actual decision. To test whether the
relationship between PAIγ and WTP was significant already at
stimulus onset, we ran a post-hoc mixed model analysis with WTP
as the dependent variable, and with PAIγ during the first second
as the independent variable and with subject as random factor.
This showed that even during the first second of product viewing,
PAIγ was significantly related to WTP (R2 = 0.309, F = 41.2, p <
0.001). This explanatory value was better than 2 s into product
viewing (R2 = 0.292, F =9 5.2, p < 0.001), but less than the third
second of product viewing (R2 = 0.315, F = 390.5, p < 0.001).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we have found that brain responses during product
viewing are significantly related to the variation in consumers’
subsequent willingness to pay for the same products. At the
time that subjects viewed products, measurements of prefrontal
asymmetry in brain activation accounted for 27.5% of the
variation in subsequent WTP. Taking product category, which
explained ∼45% of the variation in WTP, into account, improved
the model’s explanatory value to 64.1% of the variation in WTP.
These results provide novel insights into the basic
psychological processes underlying WTP calculations and
consumer choice. First, we find that WTP is mainly explained
by prefrontal asymmetry in the gamma frequency band, and
tentatively in the beta band. Second, prefrontal asymmetry in
the gamma oscillation band showed an improved explanatory
relationship with WTP responses the closer a subject is to
making the actual decision, yet the model is still significant
during the first second of product viewing. Both these effects
have significant implications for our understanding of the

we discuss the extent to which these EEG measures of brain
activation can be used as predictive value of consumer choice as
scalable, commercial applications.
Before any further discussion of the results, three issues
should be noted. First, this study had a sample size of only 16
participants, a relatively small sample, in which the power of the
statistics is relatively low. Further replication is needed to ensure
the replicability and external validity of this study.
Second, the current study only tested women, as part of
a larger study on compulsive buying behaviors in women.
Although this study only tested healthy, non-compulsive
consumers, the results do not yet warrant a gender-free
interpretation. Thus, more studies on frontal asymmetry and
consumer choice should include both women and men, and
explore potential differences in asymmetric responses.
Third, in this study, we employed the Emotiv EPOC lowcost EEG system. One question could be raised about potentially
lower data quality of this headset. To this end, we show that the
signal quality is acceptable for the purpose of this study. This
corresponds with prior studies demonstrating that this headset
produces acceptable data quality and that it reproduces brain
responses (both event-related potentials and frequency based
responses) comparable to what has been found in studies with
higher-resolution systems (Badcock et al., 2013; Grummett et al.,
2014; Christopher et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015), including
emotional processing (Harmon-Jones et al., 2010; Khushaba
et al., 2013), and even in mobile settings (Allison et al., 2010;
Debener et al., 2012). This said, further support from these
findings is needed from studies using high-resolution EEG and
other neuroimaging approaches.

band and WTP decisions, even when this frequency was studied
in isolation. This finding is significant, as it may suggest a
specific nuance in the way that alpha band asymmetry should
be interpreted in light of particular types of decision-making,
and our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms
underlying the mental calculations necessary for reaching a final
decision on what to pay for a specific product.
Alpha oscillations are classically related to activation decrease
or inhibition of neural activation, even as an “idling rhythm” of
the brain (Coan and Allen, 2003; Roche, 2004; Sauseng et al.,
2005; Händel et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2017; van Diepen and
Mazaheri, 2017). However, recent reports have also implied a
more complex functional role of the alpha band, such as divergent
thinking (Benedek et al., 2011), tonic alertness (Sadaghiani et al.,
2010), and mirror neuron function (Oberman et al., 2005).
Notably, Sabate et al. (2012) reported a dual nature of alpha
oscillations with respect to attention, in that alpha was both
related to attentional boosting of selected task calculations while
decreasing the computation of other potentially interfering tasks.
In the present context of prefrontal asymmetry, prior studies
have linked changes in prefrontal alpha band asymmetry to
approach behaviors, including reward expectancy and decision
making (Miller and Tomarken, 2001), and individual traits such
as reward sensitivity (Pizzagalli et al., 2005) and obesity (Ochner
et al., 2009). Taken together, this suggests that the change in PAIα
may be related to multiple roles throughout the period of product
viewing, including approach behavior and attentional gating,
but not necessarily something that is crucial for making valuebased decisions that manifest as WTP decisions. Notably, as PAIα
was not affected by product viewing time, it is possible that
frontal asymmetry in the alpha frequency band is not involved
in the calculations of here-and-now calculations of product
value, neither at the immediate evaluation level, or during
choice execution. Our findings thus challenges and nuances
research on frontal alpha asymmetry and approach behavior by
demonstrating that it is not related to particular choice behaviors,
and by suggesting that further studies are needed to delineate
the link between the neurobiology of approach behavior and
consumer choice.
A novel finding was that prefrontal asymmetry in the gamma
range, and tentatively in the beta range, was significantly related
to WTP choices. Prefrontal asymmetry in the beta range (PAIβ )

Effects of Separate Activity Types
The present results provide novel insights into the mechanisms
of prefrontal asymmetry and their relevance to consumer
choice. Prefrontal EEG asymmetry, typically reported in the
alpha-band range (PAIα ), has been related to cognitive and
emotional processes (Harmon-Jones and Allen, 1998; Pizzagalli
et al., 2005; Ohme et al., 2009, 2010; Ravaja et al., 2012). Our
results contradict these findings by showing that there was no
significant relationship between frontal asymmetry in the alpha

FIGURE 4 | Interactions between time and gamma on relationship to WTP. Relationship between prefrontal gamma laterality (PAIγ ) and time demonstrates that the
laterality effect is strongest at the end of product viewing time, and smallest during the first period of product viewing. The plot shows the interrelationship between
time from stimulus onset, PAIγ , and logWTP, and how the relationship between PAIγ and logWTP changes with time. In particular, note that at the time of stimulus
onset (time is low) the PAIγ is only weakly positively related to logWTP, while at higher time score (stimulus has been displayed for longer time, and the participant is
closer to making a choice) the relationship between PAIγ and logWTP is dramatically more positive. Dots denote actual data points, where black dots represent single
data points, and gray dots represent multiple converging data points.

decision making. For example, by using local field potential
EEG in monkeys while they performed a comparison decision
task, Haegens et al. (2011) found that beta oscillations during
a evaluation and comparison phase were related to subsequent
choice behavior. This may suggest a role for beta oscillations
in comparing choice options, and that prefrontal asymmetries
in this frequency band are related to value-based consumer
choices. However, the observed effects in our own data showed
unexpected features such as an inverse prefrontal asymmetry
effect and no effect of viewing time. Interestingly, PAIβ did
not change with higher proximity to the choice execution. This
is at odds with recent studies that have linked beta to the
decision to move (Jo et al., 2016). Also, a recent study by
Boksem and Smidts (2015) showed that general beta synchrony
was predictive of consumer preference and subsequent choice,
suggesting a general frontal beta engagement in consumer choice.
However, such research has pointed to beta being more related
to a meta-cognitive aspect of decision-making (Chand et al.,
2016), and for frontal theta, see Wokke et al. (2017). As the
aim of the present study was to study the asymmetric frontal
engagement of the brain, it is not an appropriate model for
studying general beta-related activity related to the time of

was only trend significant and thus brings a low explanatory
value in relating to WTP, yet provides interesting and significant
trends that should be explored further. To our knowledge, this is
also the first demonstration of in PAIβ in value-based decisionmaking. Previous studies have demonstrated a link between beta
frequency and subjective preference, such as Boksem and Smidts
(2015), in which frontal beta during movie trailers were found to
be significantly correlated with subsequent individual preference
judgments. However, here, as in other studies of beta and choice
(Polanía et al., 2014; Chand et al., 2016; Jo et al., 2016), no
frontal beta asymmetry was reported, and was not part of the
aims of the study. In this study, PAIβ demonstrated a negative
relationship with WTP. This suggests that stronger left vs. right
prefrontal asymmetry is related to a lower subsequent willingness
to pay for a product. Despite the relative small size of this effect,
this finding is unexpected and warrants further studies. Beta
band activation in general has been linked to somatosensory
and somatomotor functions (Cebolla et al., 2009; Ritter et al.,
2009), language processing (Spironelli and Angrilli, 2010; Wang
et al., 2012; Weiss and Mueller, 2012), and in complex decisionmaking and every-day behavior (Davis et al., 2011). Notably,
beta oscillations have recently been implicated in perceptual

choice. Consequently, more studies are needed to understand the
function of prefrontal beta oscillations with respect to consumer
choice.
A substantial prefrontal asymmetry effect was found in the
gamma oscillation band (PAIγ ). Gamma synchrony is thought
to represent a specific kind of activation, and is believed to play
an important role in the synchronization within functional units,
integrating proximate or distant functional units, and can do so
in a time-locked or phase-locked manner (Başar et al., 1999).
Gamma activation has been shown to relate to a number of
cognitive processes, including object recognition (Schadow et al.,
2009; Castelhano et al., 2014; Ahlfors et al., 2015), memory types
(Başar et al., 1999, 2001; Nyhus and Curran, 2010; Roux and
Uhlhaas, 2014; Heusser et al., 2016; Després et al., 2017), and
conscious processing (Aru and Bachmann, 2009; Doesburg et al.,
2009; Luo et al., 2009; Steinmann et al., 2014; Cabral-Calderin
et al., 2015; Tu et al., 2016). Most notably, gamma has been linked
to the functional coupling—or binding—of brain regions that
ensures integration and appropriate processing of information
(Klimesch et al., 2010; Ehm et al., 2011; Schneider et al., 2011).
This may suggest that the observed effects of PAIγ on WTP may
be related to a specific kind of value computation and possibly
the link to choice execution. Notably, in a study by Ravaja et al.
(2012), frontal asymmetry was found to predict consumer choice
in the face of changes in price and brand provided. However, as
this asymmetry was focused on alpha, we believe that our study
is the first demonstration of a role for frontal asymmetric gamma
oscillations in consumer choice. Moreover, as this study was for
a particular type of value computation—the specific monetary
valuation of products. Thus, these findings show that, besides
not confirming the traditional asymmetry index in the alpha
range, gamma is strongly related to consumption behavior, thus
suggesting specific psychological mechanisms (for gamma and to
some extent beta) in WTP calculations.
An exploratory whole-brain analysis was conducted to test for
other types of EEG responses related to WTP, and the results are
shown in Table 4.

Frontal Asymmetry and Product Category
Not surprisingly, since we tested products such as FMCG
products and luxury goods, WTP was significantly affected by
product category. However, a notable observation was that the
explanatory power of frontal asymmetry in different frequency
bands were affected when product category was used as a
regressor in the analysis. First, asymmetry in the beta frequency
was unaffected by product category, and the main effect of this
frequency became insignificant (not even a trend) when product
category was included as a covariate in the regression model. This
suggests that asymmetry in the beta range is possibly even less
important in WTP evaluations and choice, and caution should
be emphasized when interpreting even the main effect for beta
frequency asymmetry.
Conversely, frontal asymmetry in the gamma range was
significantly influenced by product category. Bags and shoes
showed a significant positive relationship to WTP, in that
higher asymmetry scores (stronger left than right asymmetric
engagement) were associated with a higher willingness to pay

consumer choice, our results also answers calls for neuroimaging
measures that assess and predict of consumer response and
choice (Butler, 2008; Garcia and Saad, 2008; Murphy et al.,
2008; Senior and Lee, 2008; Wilson et al., 2008; Ariely and
Berns, 2010; Fisher et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2017). Indeed, great
strides are currently made in the application of neuroimaging
tools and neuroscience insights in understanding, measuring
and affecting consumer choice. As the demand for measures
of subconscious emotional and cognitive responses is currently
peaking, and substantially higher than other research approaches
(http://www.greenbookblog.org/2017/06/27/the-top-20-mostin-demand-supplier-types-at-iiex-na-2017/) it is crucial that
such measures being used are thoroughly documented, validated
and applied to the relevant contexts. Here, it is likely that
the indexing of prefrontal asymmetry responses may hold
predictive powers of consumer choice in similar as well as
other contexts. Even so, studies have recently demonstrated that
even in a relatively small sample, brain responses can predict
not only individual choice, but even market effects, such as
music hits, twitter feeds, TV ratings, and box office movie sales
(Berns and Moore, 2012; Dmochowski et al., 2014; Boksem and
Smidts, 2015), further supporting the idea that neuroscience
can provide substantial added value to consumer research, both
academically and commercially. This warrants further studies,
and a few notable questions should be addressed in future
research:

FMCG products. That is, the higher the asymmetry (denoting a
stronger left than right engagement) the lower the WTP.
Taken together, this suggests that emotional responses during
product viewing show a product-specific relationship to what we
are willing to pay for a product. With fashion items and products
associated with “conspicuous consumption” (Kastanakis and
Balabanis, 2014; Wang and Griskevicius, 2014), it may be less of
a surprise that more positive emotional responses are related to
a higher price point for the product (and thus possibly a lower
price sensitivity). Conversely, for everyday FMCG products,
higher asymmetry scores were related to a lower willingness to
pay, suggesting that these products have a very different price
sensitivity. However, as this study did not actively look for these
types of responses, further research need to study these effects
more specifically, as well as address the nature of the WTP-PAI
relationship, and to the extent it is linear or show more complex
non-linear properties. Research should also be conducted on
groups who have different levels of interest for the products
tested. In this study, we cannot rule out that the strong positive
relationship between frontal asymmetry and WTP for bags and
shoes is driven by our selection of women who were recruited
for testing these types of products. Thus, additional studies on
different consumer segments and varying product interests are
needed.

Frontal Asymmetry and Proximity to
Decision-Making

- What are the relationship between PAI and WTP when the
duration between assessment and choice is prolonged, as in
when there are hours, days, and even weeks and months
between the PAI assessment and consumer choice?
- What is the relationship between frontal asymmetry in
different frequency bands (alpha, beta, gamma), and how do
they relate to different types of value based decision-making?
- Which brain structures are most involved in the separate effects
found for prefrontal alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations? Do
they represent separate mechanisms of choice in, brain regions
such as the OFC, dlPFC, and ACC?
- Does the effect of time on PAIγ indicate separate neural
mechanisms, such as OFC during the early face and dlPFC
during the late phase? Is the PAIγ a carrier of information from
the product evaluation point to the choice execution?
- What is the temporal unfolding of frontal asymmetry, as
measured by other types of EEG analyses, such as EventRelated Potentials (ERPs)?
- What is the predictive value of frontal asymmetry on larger
market effects? Is frontal asymmetry more related to individual
choice, or does it also signify coherent human responses at a
cultural level?

The assertion of a specific and independent role of prefrontal
gamma asymmetry is further corroborated by our final analysis,
in which we tested the interactions between PAI scores in
all three frequency bands and product viewing time. Here,
our data showed that the relationship between PAIγ and
WTP was significantly modulated by time. In particular, the
closer to the actual decision, the stronger the relationship. No
such effect was found for the PAIα or PAIβ , which possibly
implies a role for frontal asymmetry in the beta frequency
range in more stable value calculations, and a dissociation
from choice execution. This finding is closely related to recent
studies demonstrating a role of the dlPFC in planning and
executing the actual choice, while other regions such as the
OFC and ACC are more related to the initial valuation of
the choice options (Petrides and Pandya, 1999; Rolls, 2000,
2004; Plassmann et al., 2007, 2010; Rushworth et al., 2012).
Future studies should seek to combine imaging techniques,
such as simultaneous fMRI and EEG (Moosmann et al., 2008;
Rosa et al., 2010), to reveal the specific morphological and
neuropsychological nature of the different oscillations and their
roles over time.

Prefrontal Asymmetry and Consumer
Engagement, Motivation, and Choice

ETHICS STATEMENT

The present finding is among the first to demonstrate a significant
relationship between brain activity and willingness to pay in
consumer choice. Indeed, in contrast to a study on the brain
basis of WTP using fMRI (Plassmann et al., 2007), our approach
demonstrates the added value of EEG as an imaging modality
for assessing consumer preference and choice. In addition
to the insights gained from this on the basic mechanisms of
