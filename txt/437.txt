Abstract - This research aimed to measure the mental
workload of data entry processing tasks in the e-commerce
industry based on mental workload value. It was to
determine the factors influencing mental workload mainly
induced by the data entry process. The experiments without
work instruction and with two types of work instruction
were conducted to diagnose the mental workload. The
measurement of the initial mental workload condition of data
entry employees was conducted in the laboratory. Then, the
Electroencephalogram (EEG) measurement using sensors
from Emotiv was performed every 30 minutes, and the data
of EEG measurements (focus, engagement, and stress) were
collected using the laptop. Meanwhile, pulse measurement
(heart rate) was measured before and after the work. Raw
National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load
Index (NASA-TLX) and reaction time measurement were
conducted after the work. Through these experiments, the
researchers identify that mental effort and fatigue are the
significant determinants of mental workload value in the
data entry process of the e-commerce industry. In respect of
the results of work performance analysis, it is recommended
that the placement of work instruction should be near the
employee. Then, the task demand (minimum completion
target) should be adjusted according to each employee’s
capacity.

INTRODUCTION

In this vast development of the e-commerce industry
by understanding the benefits and opportunities, companies,
traders, and individuals are so eager to be involved in online
trading since the Industry 4.0. Furthermore, e-commerce
in Indonesia needs to establish a strategic action plan to

take advantage of opportunities of demographic bonus,
improve middle income, and broaden the scope of business
(Aribawa, 2016). The Ministry of Industry of the Republic
of Indonesia has developed infrastructures to support the
economic activities in digital systems such as e-commerce
business. It anticipates the needs and development of market
trends. E-commerce for Small Medium Enterprise (SMEs)
is also developed so that it will be applied in many sectors
in Indonesia (Julisar & Miranda, 2013). Nevertheless, it
is still important to improve the quality of the workforce
as well. Thus, it can meet the technological advancement
and achieve the efficient and effective mechanism of
e-commerce business process.
Based on a recent study by Borghouts, Brumby,
and Cox (2017), data entry is one of the main activities
conducted by office workers on a daily basis, with the
assumption of eight working hours a day. The data entry
task is very important for several companies because it
is a relatively straightforward task. The errors and the
consequences can range from mildly annoying to very
severe (Borghouts, Soboczenski, Cairns, & Brumby, 2015),
by requiring additional information (Wiseman, Borghouts,
Grgic, Brumby, & Cox, 2015) or using alternative input
technology affecting the data entry processing (Oladimeji,
Thimbleby, & Cox, 2011). The researchers confirm this by
using several previous research statements that the data
entry task is very suitable and chosen to develop in this
study. Then, acknowledging this long working hour of data
entry activity in an e-commerce company, the researcher
recognizes the high risk of error during the process. The
errors in data entry will affect the data quality with common
errors such as cognitive-related mistakes (Barchard &
Verenikina, 2013). Works involving computers affect the
mental activity or health of the workers. It can result in
the risk of mental fatigue in the workplace experienced by
the workers (Cheng, Lee, Shu, & Hsu, 2007). Thus, it is
assumed that there is a cognitive factor that may induce the
(mental) stress in the workplace.

This research is based on the pre-interview results
with four workers. They have many years of experience as
an office worker in conducting data entry in an e-commerce
company. With this interview results, the researcher obtains
several factors inducing stress. Those are deadlines, the
high amount of data, workplace noises, and verbal work
instructions which are not allowed to be written down. Thus,
stress due to work is a consequence of high work pressure
that may impact workers physically (an increase of heart
rate), psychically (frustration and anxiety), and behaviorally
(errors in activity). These will negatively affect the work
performance causing the gap between the realtime output of
articles completed by the worker and the expected output.
There are varieties of sources of labor stress. One is the
individual’s mental workload condition (Nachreiner, 1999).
The researchers also find several studies that
prove there are correlations between workers’ cognitive
condition, their physical condition, and their performance
(Mehta, 2016; Hollnagel, 1997). Thus, the measurement of
mental workload is essential to measure the task demand
of the workers in their activity and to predict the driving
performance and the impact on the physical health of
workers (Cain, 2007). However, the measurement of mental
workload cannot be done directly (Matthews, ReinermanJones, Barber, & Abich, 2015).
The proper criterion to improve work performance
is the mental effort of the employee during work. Some
researchers state that the higher the employee’s mental
effort is, the more achievable the desired/expected work
performance is (Brouwer, Hogervorst, Holewijn, & Van
Erp, 2014). The high mental effort is associated with high
mental workload (Hogervorst, Brouwer, & Van Erp, 2014).
Thus, the work performance is closely related to mental
workload.
Furthermore, for measuring mental workload, there
are three important key categories. Those are subjective
measurement, performance results, and psychophysiological
measurements (Galy, Cariou, & Mélan, 2012). In this study,
the researchers will accommodate all of the categories.
In this research, the researchers apply four
methods to measure the mental workload, including
Electroencephalogram (EEG), Heart Rate (HR), raw
National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load
Index (NASA-TLX), and reaction time. Moreover, there are
two methods to measure the work performance, including
error counts and completed articles after certain treatments
are applied. Previous researchers have demonstrated that
EEG signals are sensitive to cognitive (Knoll, Wang, Chen,
Xu, Ruiz, Epps, & Zarjam, 2011). The load changes in
various tasks in the EEG signal are confirmed to be related
to mental workload measurement (Berka et al., 2007). The
signal is well measured using affordable brain-sensing
technology, Emotiv (Mcmahan, Parberry, & Parsons, 2015).
The continuous (spontaneous) EEG signal is composed of
oscillations in various frequencies. Those are assumed to
reflect information representation and transfer within and
across neuronal assemblies (Klimesch, Schack, & Sauseng,
2005).
The main aim of this research is to measure the
mental workload of data entry processing tasks in the
e-commerce industry based on mental workload value
by testing several hyphoteses. There are mental fatigue
on mental workload, mental effort on mental workload,
mental workload on physical workload, mental workload
on work performance, noise level on work performance,
task demand on work performance, task difficulty on
68

work performance, interaction of three factors on work
performance, and work instruction on work performance. It
is also to improve their performance by finding the factors
affecting work performance.

II. METHODS
As a scientific justification for the participation
selection, the researcher selects four undergraduate students
to become the participants in this research. Their age is
between 20-23 years. They must fulfill several criteria.
They do not have any hearing and vision problems, and
they have experience in working as a data entry employee
in an e-commerce company for at least 1 to 2 years. For
standard equipment to do the task, the researcher provides
computers for all subjects. The computers’ specification is
a 17-inch LCD monitor, standard keyboard, a standard twobutton mouse with a scroll button, CPU Intel Core i5 with
4 GB of RAM, and Windows 7 OS with Microsoft Office
2003 installed.
This research is conducted in Industrial Engineering
Laboratory at Krida Wacana Christian University. The
measurement of the initial mental workload condition of
data entry employees is conducted in this laboratory. The
environment and working conditions are set like the real
working environment for doing the task. Furthermore, the
simulation includes the various noise level produced by coworker’s chatter and similar articles (products or apparatus
of industrial equipment). It is related to the real e-commerce
industry to provide real difficulties as close as possible. All
subjects are assigned to complete at least 30 articles (a term
in the e-commerce industry; product data/specification)
out of 50 sets in 2 hours. During two hours of working
(experiments), the EEG measurement using sensors from
Emotiv (Figure 1) is performed in every 30 minutes. The
data of measurements (focus, engagement, and stress)
are collected using a laptop with a Bluetooth connection.
Meanwhile, the pulse measurement (heart rate) is measured
before and after the work. Raw NASA-TLX measurement
and reaction time measurement are conducted after the
work because it relies on a multidimensional construct. It
is to derive an overall workload score based on a weighted
average of ratings on six subscales. Those are mental
demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance,
effort, and frustration level. Particularly, the reaction time
measurement is repeated 20 times. The results from these
measurements are the initial value of work performance,
mental workload, and the factors affecting mental workload
value.
The experiment for system improvement is
performed after obtaining the initial value of mental
workload. Before the experiment is conducted, the subjects
are required to meet the following prerequisites. The
subjects are medically not having any vision or hearing
impairment, and they are not taking any drugs/treatments
in the last 24 hours (Mercado, Reinerman-Jones, Barber,
& Leis, 2014). All these requirements are essential to
prevent any intervention in neuron signal capture during
psychophysiology measurements using the EEG device.

The subjects are assigned to input the articles into
a Microsoft Excel file. It is designed similarly on how
employees in the e-commerce company upload the data
to the website. There are ten columns to be filled. Those
are brand, name, short_desc, specification, netto_weight,
dimension_length, dimension_width, dimension_height,
dimension_unit, and volume_unit. The subjects are required
to conduct this experiment for two hours with several
treatment variables. First, the working environment with
82-87 dB represents a low level of noise, and 102-107 dB
is a high level of noise. Second, the task is to complete at
least 5 or 10 articles (as task demand). Third, task difficulty
is represented by brochures with complete information
(low difficulty) and incomplete information in which the
subjects need to search the information using the Internet
(high difficulty).
Each session is conducted for 15 minutes. It is with
three times replication and two different types of work
instructions. The temperature of the room is between 25280C with adequate light provision. The examples of
work instruction treatment of this experiment are shown in
Figures 2 and 3 using the EEG measurement sensor.

table is 70 cm x 74 cm x 75 cm, while the working chair is
62 cm x 61 cm x 95 cm. After the experiment is performed,
the researcher obtains the end value of work performance,
mental workload measurement, and the factors affecting
work performance. Thus, the research workflow diagram is
presented in Figure 4.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Based on the subjects’ work performance in the
initial condition, the researcher proposes that there is a
significant interdependence between work performance
and mental workload value. Free variables used are derived
from the value of the effort (EF) dimension of the NASATLX questionnaire. It mentions that the cognitive variance
affecting work performance is a mental effort (Mercado et
al., 2014). From the measurement, the results of raw NASATLX is between 68-74, Cardiovascular Load (CVL) is
between 33-50%, and reaction time measurement is between
372-429. The researcher also measures EEG data. The
average measurement data of focus is 46%, the engagement
is 70%, and stress is 51%, as shown in Table 1. Based on this
result, the subjects are ready to do the experiments.

In the initial condition of the data entry process, the
researchers find a significant influence of physical workload
on mental workload value. The results of pulse measurement
using EEG reveal that mental fatigue and mental effort
are significantly correlated to the heart rate. It represents
mental workload (F = 5,719, 7,037; p < 0,05). This finding
reinforces the results of subjective measurement conducted
by the subjects. It finds that mental effort and mental fatigue
significantly affect the mental workload.
Next, this research analyzes that task demand
is the sole factor. It is significantly affecting the work
performance as noise level (NL), task difficulty (TDif),
task demand (TDem), and their correlations (see Table 2) in
both different work instruction conditions. In this research,
the researcher does not gather much evidence to prove the
significance of noise level towards the data entry process.
After doing the experiments, this study obtains that there
is also no interaction between noise level, task demand,
and task difficulty that affect work performance. It is due
to the tendency of linear data patterns in the result. Thus,
the significant factor affecting the data entry process can be
explained by several statistical tests. The researcher conducts
the paired t-test to identify the influence of different work
instruction treatments on work performance. The researcher
obtains the result, as shown in Table 3. The Mean is 1,177,

S.Dev is 2,72, Standard Error Mean is 0,278, and the 95%
confidence interval of the difference for lower and upper
are 0,626 and 1,729 consecutively. The result of the paired
test in Table 3 shows that the influence of different work
instruction is affecting work performance.
The researcher conducts the discussion by analyzing
the tests, experiments, and measurements. After doing all
the steps, the researcher shows the initial condition of the
mental workload of the data entry process. In this initial
condition, the mental fatigue and mental effort notably
determine the value of mental workload. This result is in
accordance with the results of Käthner, Wriessnegger,
Müller-Putz, Kübler, and Halder (2014).
Moreover, these results show that the mental workload
experienced by the subjects also affects the physical
workload as expressed in Mazloum, Kumashiro, Izumi, and
Higuchi (2008). They agreed that mental workload was an
influence on the individual’s physic and psychophysiology.
Ultimately, the mental workload experienced by the subject
remarkably determines work performance. Therefore, the
results also support the argument of Young, Brookhuis,
Wickens, and Hancock (2015). The purpose of studying
the mental workload of the employee is to understand its
association with the employee’s work performance. The
treatment (work instruction) and the influence (noise level,
task demand, and task difficulty) are shown in Figure 5.
Furthermore, the researcher obtains more hypotheses
related to several work performance measurements,
treatments, and their interactions. It is shown in Table 4.
The hypotheses of H1, H2, H3, H4, H6, and H9 are rejected.
Meanwhile, H5, H6, and H8 are accepted.
With several experiment conditions, the researcher
concludes that only task demand significantly affects the
work performance of the subjects. This result is similar
to previous research that the task demand is a factor
influencing work performance (Mazloum et al., 2008). On
the other hand, task difficulty (Causse, Fabre, Giraudet,

Gonzalez, & Peysakhovich, 2015) is not proven to affect
work performance during the data entry process. This
research has yet to succeed in revealing the correlation
between task difficulty and work performance during the
data entry process based on the hypothesis in Table 4.
However, the researcher obtains other factors. This work
is also unable to identify the correlation between noise
level and work performance (Mallick, Badruddin, Haleem,
Siddique, & Tandur, 2007). These three factors affecting
work performance presumed to interact with each other
in turn, are not establishing a significant interaction. So,
this factor should be eliminated from factors affecting
work performance, especially for data entry processing in
e-commerce.
The choice of work instruction proposed as a system
improvement is based on the evaluation of the subject’s
mental fatigue and mental effort during the experiment.
Those two factors are determined to be the indicator
of work performance improvement. The treatments
proposed as system improvement measures are to place
the work instruction near the employee (on the table) and
to adjust the minimum target of article completion based
on the manager’s judgment/expectation towards certain
employees. The results are contradicted with the statement
that work instruction put on the wall in the middle of the
room can reduce the employee’s mental workload (Bosch,
Könemann, De Cock, & Van Rhijn, 2017). For this
condition, the researcher assumes that this distinct result
is due to the difference in work instruction visualization.
In this research, the subjects use a print-out document
attached to the wall, whereas the other researchers utilize a
projector to show the work instruction. Thus, as a result of
the difficulty in viewing the work instruction with too small
font and the necessity to move from a chair to see the work
instruction, this condition will cause another stress factor to
the employee. Furthermore, this condition is categorized as
independent of the data entry activity.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
By using several types of measurement and various
conditions in doing the data entry process, the researchers
conclude that the employee’s mental workload in the initial
condition is high during the data entry process without
treatment. This condition is based on the facts gathered by
subjective measurement exhibiting a high mental workload
value and reinforced by psychophysiological measurement.
The measurement is stating that the data entry employee
experiences mental fatigue when doing the task. The results
of work performance analysis in initial condition (without
treatment) show that undocumented work instruction can
increase the risk of error during data entry.
Next, in this study, the researchers identify that
mental effort and fatigue are the significant determinants
of mental workload value in the data entry process of the
e-commerce industry. Thus, the researchers recommend
that the placement of work instruction should be near the
employee. The task demand (minimum completion target)
should be adjusted according to each employee’s capacity.
In the company, the researchers suggest this employee’s
capacity can be evaluated from the weekly performance
data reports.
The experiment with a near-real job description
approach has proven the relation between the mental
workload values in this experiment to the mental workload
values in the real data entry process. In addition, the noise
level is found to be insignificant to work performance. The
work instruction and task demand significantly influence
work performance. The researchers’ priority is to suggest
a system improvement in the data entry process of the
e-commerce industry in regards to the mental workload
value of the employees.
Furthermore, there are some courses of action that
can be considered for further research improvement. First,
several ergonomic factors can be added as this research has
disregarded it. The factors are ergonomics of keyboard and
mouse, chair height, and physical features of employees.
Thus, future researchers may consider the relationship
between the ergonomics factor to the measurement of
mental workload for a more accurate result. Second,
this research is constrained by the working time of the
subjects. The result may be affected by hurriedness, level
of seriousness/concentration, and stamina (compared
to the real employee in with real work demand) or other
72

measurements of psychological factors (daily habits,
working habits, or dietary habits). Third, the application of
machine learning using fast computational algorithms such
as clustering and classification can be a very interesting
topic. In the future, this method will be applicable to predict
the mental workload using real-time measurement sensors
by comparing several ages of the employee during their
work in a real condition (direct measurement).
