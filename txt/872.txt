In the high stakes world of International sport even the smallest change in performance can make the
difference between success and failure, leading sports professionals to become increasingly interested
in the potential beneﬁts of neuroimaging. Here we describe evidence from EEG studies that either identify neural signals associated with expertise in sport, or employ neurofeedback to improve performance.
Evidence for the validity of neurofeedback as a technique for enhancing sports performance remains
limited. By contrast, progress in characterizing the neural correlates of sporting behavior is clear: frequency domain studies link expert performance to changes in alpha rhythms, whilst time-domain studies
link expertise in response evaluation and motor output with modulations of P300 effects and readiness
potentials. Despite early promise, however, ﬁndings have had relatively little impact for sports professionals, at least in part because there has been a mismatch between lab tasks and real sporting activity.
After selectively reviewing existing ﬁndings and outlining limitations, we highlight developments in
mobile EEG technology that offer new opportunities for sports neuroscience.

investigation of sports performance into big business. Athletes
are now supported by a range of specialist coaches and trainers,
all aiming to stimulate changes in performance that can make
the difference between winning and losing. Consequently, sports
professionals have become interested in brain imaging, both as a
route to a better understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying sporting behavior, and as a means to develop new methods
to enhance performance. Equally, cognitive neuroscientists have

become increasingly interested in sporting behavior, at least in
part because elite sport provides an ideal model for understanding expertise – both in its acquisition and execution. In practice,
however, reﬂection on what is required to be successful at the
highest level in sport reveals a multifaceted picture of optimal performance. As well as possessing physical prowess, elite athletes
must develop a range of sport speciﬁc cognitive skills and exhibit
superior integration across the domains of perception, cognition
and action (Yarrow et al., 2009). In this context, the emerging ﬁeld
of sports neuroscience seeks to produce greater understanding of
brain-behavior links, ultimately aiming to inform sporting practice
and enhance performance.
Cognitive neuroscience employs a range of brain imaging methods to investigate links between brain and behavior, but many are
simply impractical for studying sporting behavior, particularly outside of the laboratory (e.g., functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging,
single cell electrophysiology and Magneto-encephalography). By
contrast, techniques that allow brain stimulation (e.g., Transcranial
Magnetic Stimulation) offer genuine potential to enhance realworld sports performance (for a review see Yarrow et al., 2009).
Although brain stimulation techniques can be used to directly
induce changes in brain function independent of agency, the longterm consequences of brain stimulation remain unknown (Davis
and Van Koningsbruggen, 2013). Moreover, in competitive contexts, the use of brain stimulation techniques raises serious ethical
issues that have yet to be fully addressed by sports practitioners
(Banissy and Muggleton, 2013; see Davis, 2013, for discussion of
‘neurodoping’). Fortunately, however, one brain imaging methodology avoids the practical and ethical concerns discussed above,
namely EEG (the Electroencephalogram).
EEG is one of the oldest methods for assessing the relationship
between brain and behavior, and provides a direct real-time measure of neural activity. EEG is recorded using electrodes placed
at speciﬁc locations across the scalp (e.g., frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital etc.); hence it is relatively inexpensive and easy to
apply (see Fig. 1 for a schematic recording set up). Importantly,
although EEG provides limited spatial resolution about the origins

equipment and the solid line illustrates the connection to the power supply.

of neural activity, it has exceedingly high temporal resolution –
making it ideal for tracking the rapid execution of sensory, cognitive
and motor processes inherent to sporting behavior. Indeed, from a
historical perspective, researchers have long appreciated that EEG
methods are highly suited to identifying the neural mechanisms
critical for sports performance (e.g., Crews and Landers, 1993;
Hatﬁeld et al., 1984; Salazar et al., 1990). Similarly, EEG has long
been used to inﬂuence behavior, via neurofeedback training, which
facilitates recognition and modiﬁcation of mental states associated
with particular patterns of cortical arousal and concomitant behavioral outcomes (e.g., Kamiya, 1962, 1968; Lubar and Shouse, 1976;
Landers et al., 1991).
Here we provide a selective overview of evidence to date,
derived from studies investigating a range of sporting behavior,
including the use of EEG as a neurofeedback technique. As we show,
the evidence base at this stage remains limited, and we highlight
methodological, terminological and analytic concerns. Moreover,
for the most part, existing studies largely reﬂect laboratory-based
investigations, with only a small number employing EEG during
real-world sporting behavior. As a result, current ﬁndings fail to
capture the complexity of the neural mechanisms implicated in
active sports performance. Critically, however, as we highlight
toward the end of the review, recent developments in mobile EEG
technology provide an unprecedented opportunity to circumvent
many of the issues inherent in existing work. Moving out of the lab
and into the world will undoubtedly create new challenges that
must be addressed, but the application of mobile EEG for assessing
sports performance clearly has the potential to revolutionize the
neuroscience of sporting behavior.

2. EEG in the frequency domain: alpha activity and neural
efﬁciency
EEG research within the sporting context has largely focused
on alpha rhythms (8–12 Hz). Alpha rhythms are clearly visible in
raw EEG as a distinct set of deﬂections (oscillations) in the ongoing
brainwaves; importantly alpha is easily distinguished from other
rhythms (e.g., Theta at 4–7 Hz, and Beta at 15–30 Hz). Alpha is the
most dominant frequency in the EEG of adults and has also been
the most extensively studied in the wider literature (for a review
see Başar, 2012). Historically, no clear agreement has been reached
regarding the functional meaning of EEG alpha wave activity or
even which measures best characterize it. The physiological basis
of alpha signals (including anatomical and topographical factors)
means that measurement of alpha activity can involve tracking
changes in the amplitude, frequency or phase of underlying oscillations. As a result, reported indices of alpha may, for example, reﬂect
changes in individual spectral alpha peak frequency, or changes in
power within an individually determined alpha range (for detailed
discussion see Bazanova and Vernon, 2013). Given advances in the
measurement of alpha, it is perhaps unsurprising that since the
original discovery of alpha rhythms by Hans Berger (1929), claims
regarding the functional role of alpha oscillations have changed
substantially. While early work associated alpha with cortical idling
or disengagement from cognitive processing (e.g., see Adrian and
Matthews, 1934), a wealth of contemporary research now supports
the view that alpha plays an active role in cognitive processing (e.g.,
see Cooper et al., 2003; Klimesch et al., 2007).
Today it is generally agreed that alpha oscillations operate to
actively inhibit unnecessary or conﬂicting processing in the cortex,
and are often described as a mechanism for increasing signal-tonoise ratios or controlling task irrelevant processing (Klimesch
et al., 2000; Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, 1999). Consequently,
alpha activity can be detected at multiple locations across the
scalp, in response to a wide array of task demands; from this

J.L. Park et al. / Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 52 (2015) 117–130

perspective alpha reﬂects a change in processing that can be
observed for a range of different functions. Support for this view
comes from ﬁndings showing that distinct sub-bands of alpha are
associated with multiple operations, many of which are highly
relevant to sport, including global arousal and attentional processes (Klimesch, 1999; Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, 1999; Thut
et al., 2006), elaboration of sensorimotor or semantic information
(Klimesch et al., 1996, 1997, 1998; Klimesch, 1999), maintenance in
working memory (Jensen and Tesche, 2002; Tuladhar et al., 2007),
volitional inhibition of motor programmes (Hummel et al., 2002),
and motor learning (Jancke et al., 2006; Koeneke et al., 2006). Before
providing further details of the evidence relating to sport, we ﬁrst
introduce key terminology employed within the EEG literature. We
will then summarize EEG research ﬁndings and related methodologies that have measured cognitive and motor skill behaviors and
can be interpreted within theoretical models of expertise and skill
acquisition.
Analytically, levels of alpha in the sports literature are typically
characterized by decomposing the raw EEG signal into constituent
frequency components using the Fourier transform to provide a
“power spectrum” (see Fig. 2). In essence, spectral power reﬂects
the square of the average peak-to-peak magnitude over a speciﬁed time period or epoch. Increases or decreases in spectral
power in speciﬁc frequency bands are established relative to a predeﬁned baseline. For example, resting state alpha (e.g., recorded
eyes-closed, while inactive) is often used to provide a baseline
from which changes in alpha power can be measured (e.g., eyesopen, during task performance). Because alpha is always present
in raw EEG to some degree, the choice of baseline has signiﬁcant
impact on the pattern of brain activity reported. Changes in power
also have speciﬁc terms within the EEG literature: Event-Related
Desynchronization (ERD) is used to refer to a reduction in spectral
power relative to baseline, while Event-Related Synchronization
(ERS) describes an increase in spectral power relative to baseline (Pfurtscheller, 1992). Functionally, alpha ERD is described as
reﬂecting the release of cortical inhibition, while alpha ERS signals
the presence of inhibition. The concepts of inhibition and neural
efﬁciency are pervasive in the sports EEG literature, and are consistent with several models of skill learning that have been highly
inﬂuential in the ﬁeld of sports science.
In a seminal theoretical paper, Fitts and Posner (1967) identiﬁed three distinct stages of skill acquisition (an early cognitive
stage, an intermediate associative stage and a ﬁnal autonomous
stage) that reﬂect increasing efﬁciency of execution. The initial cognitive stage is characterized by effortful processing, supporting the
conscious regulation of movement. The second associative stage is
characterized by more efﬁcient processing of task relevant sensory
information and greater efﬁciency in the execution of movement,
while the ﬁnal autonomous stage captures the transfer from conscious regulation of movement to automaticity. Whilst Fitts and
Posner offer a speciﬁcally cognitive account of expertise, alternative physiological models also exist within the sports literature. For
example, expertise related changes in movement efﬁciency (i.e.,
when coordinating and controlling joints and muscle function in
motor skills) have been explored and evaluated relative to Bernstein’s notion of ‘freezing’ and ‘degrees of freedom’ in movement
(Bernstein, 1967).
From a physiological perspective, expertise requires efﬁciency
in motor output programming. Initially inefﬁcient movement solutions display a ﬁxing (freezing) of joints and an increased activation
of muscle groups relative to task requirements. With practice and
time the restriction in degrees of freedom develops, resulting in a
greater efﬁciency in movement, accomplished by a release of joint
restrictions and superior muscle functioning (e.g., Anderson and
Sidaway, 1994; Sparrow, 1992). Furthermore, with relevant experience and exposure, expertise results in coordination and control,

allowing resistance to develop against intervening factors such as
anxiety and competition pressure (Collins et al., 2001). This ability to self-regulate cognition, emotion and movement behavior is
relevant to successful sports performance and appears important
for an effective transition to the automatic level of performance
(Singer, 2002). In summary, theoretical models of motor learning
and skill acquisition help examine expertise with reference to both
cognitive and physiological levels of explanation.
As we highlight below, however, existing EEG studies of sports
performance have largely focused on cognitive explanations of
expertise. In line with Fitts and Posner’s (1967) model, a wealth
of behavioral evidence has associated peak performance (related
to the ﬁnal stage) with the subjective feeling of automaticity (e.g.,

120

Cohn, 1991; Anderson et al., 2014). Links between behavioral and
neural markers of efﬁciency were ﬁrst described in the ﬁeld of cognition (Del Percio et al., 2011a), where higher levels of intelligence
and superior performance have been associated with reduced
cortical activation (Neubauer et al., 1995; Grabner et al., 2006;
Neubauer et al., 2004). Consistent with this view, in the following
section we review studies employing simple lab based tasks that
contrast expert and novice athletes, demonstrating that increasing neural efﬁciency also underpins the development of sporting
expertise.
2.1. Expert vs. novice performance
Studies comparing expert and novice performance have demonstrated that changes in alpha over speciﬁc regions of the scalp, are
associated with skilled cognitive-motor performance in athletes:
as such, alpha is thought to index changes in the neural response
linked to training and the acquisition of expertise. Differences
in eyes-closed resting state alpha rhythms have been observed
between elite and amateur karate athletes and non-athletes, with
an increase in parietal and occipital low-frequency (8–10.5 Hz)
alpha for elite compared to amateur athletes and non-athletes;
a result that was subsequently replicated with a group of rhythmic gymnasts (Babiloni et al., 2010). Whilst only a single condition
was employed in these initial studies, with no baseline measure of
alpha, similar results were found in a follow up study that directly
compared eyes-open to eyes-closed conditions. In this case, compared to non-athletes, karate athletes exhibited reduced alpha ERD
over frontal and central locations – a signiﬁcant reduction of reactivity in the alpha band to eyes opening (Del Percio et al., 2011b).
Although these neural differences were measured in simple lab
based settings rather than during sporting behavior, they nonetheless provide tentative evidence of greater neural efﬁciency in elite
athletes.
While these basic differences between athletes and non-athletes
could suggest functional changes in alpha levels as a result of
intensive training, based on published ﬁndings reported to date
it is not possible to isolate a single cause driving the observed
changes. For example, it is highly likely that athlete and non-athlete
groups differ systematically in a number of important respects,
many of which can inﬂuence brain activity, ranging from personality type (Tran et al., 2001) to levels of fatigue and drowsiness
(Borghini et al., 2014). Such variability matters, because genetic,
anatomical, physiological and psychological factors have all been
shown to inﬂuence the power and prevalence of baseline levels
of alpha in the EEG of individuals (for a review see Bazanova and
Vernon, 2013). As such, observed differences in baseline (or activity related) alpha levels could be explained in terms of heritable
genetic characteristics that are predictive of athletic competence,
rather than tracking level of expertise as a function of intensive
training.
Notwithstanding concerns about potential confounding variables when comparing different groups of participants, the use of
simple lab based tasks also limits the interpretability of the results
with reference to sporting behavior. Demonstrations of reductions
in cortical activation using tasks more closely aligned with sport
speciﬁc skills are, therefore, essential to elucidate neural factors
underpinning development of expertise as a function of training.
One approach is to measure alpha activity during the observation
of sports speciﬁc actions. For example, compared to non-athletes,
when viewing videos of real competition performances, rhythmic
gymnasts have been shown to make more accurate ‘judgments
of quality’ (compared to coaches ratings) and to exhibit lower
levels of alpha ERD. Moreover, in rhythmic gymnasts, high frequency alpha (10–12 Hz) ERD was greater in magnitude for videos
associated with high judgment error than for those associated with

low judgment error (Babiloni et al., 2009). In this case, based on
source reconstruction analyses the changes in alpha associated
with expertise and performance were linked to different neural
pathways (although the actual location of recorded changes in
alpha were not reported). The gymnasts’ greater experience and
expertise is thought to underpin their ability to make judgments of
quality, with a sub-band of alpha speciﬁcally tracking the accuracy
of observations of sporting behavior.
An alternative to the observation of sporting behavior has been
the use of basic motor tasks to directly compare levels of neural efﬁciency in athletes and non-athletes during behavior. For example,
research has shown that elite fencing and karate athletes exhibit
less of a decrease in alpha (over frontal, central, and parietal electrodes) than non-athletes for monopoladic (one-foot) standing (Del
Percio et al., 2009a). Similarly, these athletes also exhibit reduced
alpha ERD over the primary motor cortex during preparation and
execution of wrist extensions (Del Percio et al., 2010). The use of
basic motor tasks is a signiﬁcant improvement on simple lab tasks,
because they require behavior that is actually relevant to the chosen
sport. Arguably, however, the observation of real sports provides a
stronger link to the richness and complexity of sporting behavior.
Regardless, neither approach provides a direct assessment of links
between brain activity and aspects of sports expertise operative
during real performance.

2.2. EEG activity during the pre-shot period
Studies designed to measure brain activity during performance
have, to date, been limited to ‘closed sports’ (e.g., shooting, golf,
archery, etc.), where issues of equipment portability and movement
artifact are not a signiﬁcant impediment. One reason that closed
sports provide an ideal opportunity to measure active performance
is that they typically involve ﬁxed routines (e.g., target selection,
shot execution), allowing neural activity to be segmented over
time in relation to that behavior. In particular, researchers have
focused on target sports, examining neural activity present in the
seconds leading up to shot execution, known as the pre-shot period.
For example, examination of brain activity recorded pre-shot during shooting shows that experts exhibit greater alpha power over
left-temporal electrodes than novices (Hauﬂer et al., 2000, 2002).
Moreover, in skilled marksmen, this increase in left-temporal alpha
power has also been shown to be progressive over the pre-shot
period, being strongest just prior to trigger pull (Hatﬁeld et al.,
1984).
A number of studies investigating the pre-shot period in target shooting have shown that superior performance is related to
an increase in alpha power over the left-temporal region of the
scalp (for a detailed review see Janelle and Hatﬁeld, 2008). Lefttemporal cortex is typically associated with verbal-analytic and
language functions, while right-temporal cortex is associated with
visuo-spatial and integrative processing (Springer and Deutsch,
1998). Consequently, changes in alpha observed during pre-shot
routines have been interpreted as reﬂecting a reduction in interference from overthinking (evidenced by increased left-temporal
alpha), accompanied by the maintenance of visuo-spatial coordination (evidenced by right-temporal alpha being unaffected). In
line with the Fitts and Posner (1967) model of skill acquisition, it is
claimed that skilled marksmen have an enhanced ability to inhibit
verbal-analytic processes (that may be necessary in the early stages
of aiming, but ultimately interfere with performance if continued
during execution), as indexed by increases in alpha power in the left
hemisphere. However, other evidence challenges this view ﬁnding that really high levels of left-temporal alpha power and low
beta power during the pre-shot period was associated with poorer
performance in skilled archers (Salazar et al., 1990).

J.L. Park et al. / Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 52 (2015) 117–130

Evidence for performance related differences in alpha has also
been identiﬁed in another sport – during the pre-shot period in golf.
Fewer studies have been carried out with golfers to date, partially
due to the potential for head movement artifacts, but focusing on
the pre-shot activity during putting allows such artifacts to be minimized. For example, Baumeister et al. (2008) contrasted expert and
novice performance during putting toward a target from 3 meters,
over 5 sessions, each lasting for 4 minutes. Expert golfers performed
better than novices overall, and better performance was associated
with an increase in upper alpha power at parietal electrodes, along
with an increase in theta power at frontal electrodes. The increase
in frontal theta power for experts was interpreted as indexing more
focused attention, while the increase in parietal upper alpha power
was interpreted as reﬂecting better inhibition of irrelevant sensory
information.
As well as differences between expert and novice golfers during
the pre-shot period, differences in levels of alpha have also been
demonstrated in the pre-shot period for successful and unsuccessful putts (Babiloni et al., 2008). In this study, expert golfers were
required to execute 100 putts on a golf green simulator, from a
distance of 2.1 meters. To ensure that at least 30% of putts were
unsuccessful the diameter of the hole was adjusted for each participant (108 mm – standard, 80 mm, 60 mm). Results demonstrated
increases in high frequency alpha ERD (10–12 Hz) for successful
compared to unsuccessful putts over frontal and central midline
(Fz and Cz), and right sensorimotor (C4), electrodes (see Fig. 3).
Moreover, the reduction in alpha power correlated with the degree
of error on unsuccessful putts, with stronger reductions associated
with smaller degrees of error, as measured by the distance from the
hole.
Whilst the preceding study once again provides evidence for
changes in performance related alpha in a real sporting context,
concerns with the ﬁndings cannot be ignored. From the perspective
of sports practitioners, adjusting the size of the hole undoubtedly
sacriﬁces some of the ecological validity gained by recording during actual performance. Moreover, from an EEG perspective, it is
unclear why reductions in alpha power at electrodes Fz and Cz
were not present in between, at electrode FCz, which would be
expected to show a highly similar pattern. Perhaps more puzzling
still is the fact that, rather than the previously reported increase
in alpha, in this case superior performance was associated with a
reduction in alpha power. Consideration of inconsistencies in ﬁndings reviewed thus far, both across sports and between studies,
highlights the potential importance of characterizing functional
relationships across cortical regions.
In a follow-up study, Babiloni et al. (2011) employed the same
procedure reported above to investigate the functional coupling of
alpha rhythms across electrode locations in expert golfers for successful and unsuccessful putts. Results revealed intra-hemispheric
coherence in low frequency alpha (8–10 Hz) between parietal and
frontal, and parietal and central sites in both hemispheres, an
effect that was larger for successful putts. Comparable results
were found for coherence of high frequency alpha (10–12 Hz)
between frontal and parietal sites. Enhanced functional coupling
of low and high frequency alpha between parietal regions, and
temporal and occipital regions, has also been reported for elite
air pistol shooters compared to non-athletes (Del Percio et al.,
2011a). Taken together, these studies suggest that superior performance is associated with enhanced functional coherence of
alpha rhythms prior to execution, consistent with the idea that
expertise acquired over practice can elicit changes in the functional organization of the athletes’ brain. Speciﬁcally, both of the
studies outlined above link expertise with enhanced communication between visuo-spatial parietal sites and regions associated
with motor control and attentional processing. However, whether
changes in alpha coherence indicative of expertise vary as a

function of sport or speciﬁc task demands remains an open question.
3. Issues and inconsistencies
Globally, the literature to date supports the view that changes
in the alpha band are linked to differences in performance, but the
speciﬁc details of the relationship remain unclear, in part because of
inconsistencies in the direction of effects across studies. One possibility is that the cognitive effects of changes in alpha are themselves
modulated by changes in other frequency bands (e.g., Salazar et al.,
1990; see below in this section for further discussion). Alternatively, thinking of the relationship between alpha and performance
as a simple linear function, where high degrees of alpha are always

122

J.L. Park et al. / Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 52 (2015) 117–130

beneﬁcial for performance, may underestimate the complexity of
the relationship. In line with this assertion, it has been argued
that lower levels of alpha indicate increased cognitive engagement,
while medium levels index a reduction in this engagement moving
toward greater automaticity of execution, and high levels indicate
“cortical idling” which results in poorer performance (Deeny et al.,
2003).
3.1. Methodological
In addition to variation in the direction of the relationship
between alpha levels and performance outcomes, uncertainty is
also introduced by inconsistencies in the scalp location where performance related changes in alpha have been reported for target
sports. For example, in contrast to the left-temporal focus of alpha
described above, a study of commonwealth level air-pistol shooters showed an increase in occipital alpha power preceding the best
shots (Loze et al., 2001). Similarly, a study of pre-shot activity in
elite air pistol shooters and non-athletes reported lower alpha ERD
extending across frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital scalp locations for elite athletes, while an increase in the magnitude of upper
alpha ERS (10–12 Hz) over right-parietal and left-central locations
was associated with high score shots (Del Percio et al., 2009b). Contrasting aspects of the methodology employed in these two studies
highlights a number of key problems that exist in the sports EEG
literature in general, which complicates interpretation of the evidence to date.
Oscillations in the alpha range are associated with global communication and can, accordingly, be detected over the entire
surface of the cortex (Nunez, 1995; Knyazev, 2007), and research
has also demonstrated functional coupling between alpha measured at anterior and posterior locations (Srinivasan, 1999).
However, fast (or upper) alpha rhythms are predominately
generated in posterior regions, with slower (or lower) alpha
rhythms predominately observed in anterior regions (Nunez and
Katznelson, 1981). Importantly, differences in the location of
reported alpha, and as a result apparent differences in cognitive
functions associated with optimal performance in sport, are at least
in part driven by the choice of electrode locations. In practice, the
bulk of early target sports studies measured alpha from a small
number of targeted recording sites (e.g., the study described above
by Loze et al., 2001, employed 3 channels: T3, T4, Oz), whereas
some more recent studies employ larger montages more typical
of the wider EEG literature (e.g., the study described above by Del
Percio et al., 2009b, employed 56 channels). Thus, given the ubiquitous nature of alpha across the scalp, differences in the number and
location of electrodes across studies are likely to account for some
of the apparent inconsistencies in the reported location of effects.

dependent upon the baseline used as a starting point (e.g., consider
the use of eyes-closed supine versus eyes-open upright-standing
as potential baselines in relation to observation of performance).
More broadly, existing studies of sports performance typically
focus primarily, if not entirely, on alpha – ignoring the fact that
changes in speciﬁc frequency bands do not occur in isolation and
can often be reciprocal in nature. For example, a negative relationship between alpha and delta oscillations has been identiﬁed, such
that increases in alpha are accompanied by decreases in slow-wave
delta (Robinson, 1999). The presence of multiple frequencies, and
the possibility of interactions between frequencies, are generally
underappreciated or ignored within the sports literature. As such, at
this stage, it is difﬁcult to assess whether inconsistencies in ﬁndings
for target sports relate to differences in task demands or are merely
a product of differences in method, terminology or analysis strategy. In general, future work in sports should adhere more closely to
existing guidelines detailing accepted standards for recording and
analysis of EEG data in the wider literature (e.g., see Picton et al.,
1995, 2000; Sharbrough et al., 1991), and give careful consideration
to sport speciﬁc challenges raised by recording EEG data during
motion (see Thompson et al., 2008). Notwithstanding the issues
outlined above, ﬁndings to date do, overall, support the presence
of a relationship between alpha levels and optimal performance in
target sports.
Overall, the preceding sections highlight both similarities and
differences in patterns of alpha activity found across studies. While
evidence for the role of alpha in sporting expertise has consistently
been reported, it is equally clear that results are somewhat variable
(e.g., in the location and direction of changes in alpha). As already
noted (see Section 2.1) physiological, developmental and psychological factors can all inﬂuence frequency components, providing
many opportunities for confounding factors in between group comparisons. For example, groups of novices are highly likely to be more
heterogeneous in their behavior than groups of experts, potentially
resulting in neural differences regardless of factors related to expertise (cf. Chuang et al., 2013). Wide adoption of the expert/novice
paradigm, and a broader reliance on between group comparisons,
is in part driven by the main goal of cognitive neuroscience: to
identify brain-behavior links that hold for populations as a whole.
While useful in identifying basic neural mechanisms that characterize expert performance across a variety of sports, reliance on
between group contrasts also means that the literature to date has
largely failed to address the main goal of sports science: to assess
and enhance performance in individual athletes. Before returning
to the issue of person-speciﬁc assessment in the context of tailored
neurofeedback protocols, the following section ﬁrst introduces an
alternative approach to examining performance related brain activity.

3.2. Analysis and interpretation
4. EEG in the time domain: ERPs and stages of processing
Alongside concerns about variability in electrode locations used
in sports neuroscience studies, a number of wider concerns have
been raised regarding the interpretation of brain oscillation data in
general (e.g., Bazanova and Vernon, 2013; Cohen and Gulbinaite,
2014). Two speciﬁc challenges resonate strongly with work examining sports performance, namely, a lack of consistency in analysis
strategy and a failure to address the potential for multi-scale interactions between different frequencies. Lack of consistency across
studies is particularly apparent in the bandwidths used to deﬁne
alpha, with some researchers splitting frequency bands into upper
and lower portions (sometimes on a person-by-person basis, the
so-called ‘individual alpha frequency’ strategy), and others reporting data for entire bandwidths (chosen based on an a priori basis).
Another prominent source of inconsistency lies in the choice of
baseline period: reported increases or decreases in band power are

A comparatively small number of sports performance studies have examined neural activity in the time domain, mapping
changes in EEG to particular event milestones by forming
Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). ERPs reveal changes in activity
speciﬁcally associated with an event of interest (e.g., seeing a stimulus or making a response), typically characterized as modulations
in the amplitude (i.e., magnitude) of activity measured over a particular period of time, at speciﬁc locations over the scalp, when
contrasting across experimental conditions (see Luck, 2005). Time
and frequency based analyses provide complimentary insights into
the neural basis of behavior, and in principle the same EEG data
can be examined in both domains. The ﬁndings cannot always be
readily compared, however, in part because the temporal precision
employed with the two methods differs. Whilst frequency data is

J.L. Park et al. / Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 52 (2015) 117–130

typically measured over seconds, ERPs are used to track changes
in activity over tens or hundreds of milliseconds – aligning well
with the rapid timecourse of sporting activity. As a result, studies
in the time domain have largely examined two broad categories of
ERP effect relevant for sporting action; which are reviewed in turn
below.
4.1. Preparing, inhibiting and executing
A number of ERP studies have focused on well-characterized
neural correlates of movement, namely readiness potentials,
related to preparation for making a response, and motor potentials,
related to the actual execution of the response. When participants
are required to make motor responses (e.g., ﬁnger, arm or leg movements) the period preceding the execution of the movement is
associated with sustained changes in brain activity – a gradual
reduction in electrical activity is followed by a sharp spike in activity that can be measured from electrodes positioned over motor
cortex (e.g., C3 and C4). For example, compared to amateurs and
non-athletes, elite table tennis players exhibit an increase in the
amplitude of readiness potentials measured during performance
of a Posner-style attention task (Hung et al., 2004). In this study
a mixture of valid and invalid directional cues were presented to
participants, indicating the location of a subsequent target stimulus; modulations were observed in the response preceding the
target at electrodes located over sensorimotor areas for the hand
corresponding to the side of a directional cue. This ﬁnding was
interpreted as reﬂecting ‘superior reactivity’ as a function of sports
speciﬁc expertise, presumably because table tennis players use
movement cues from opponents to predict the trajectory of the
ball during play. However, use of a standardized lab based test of
attention employing abstract cues unrelated to sporting context
is clearly not equivalent to reading complex movement cues during performance, making links to sports speciﬁc skills somewhat
tentative.
Differences in movement potentials have also been reported
by studies employing simple lab tasks more closely aligned with
sports speciﬁc skills. For example, compared to non-athletes, elite
riﬂe shooters have been shown to exhibit a reduction in movement
related cortical potentials measured during self-paced ﬁnger movement (Di Russo et al., 2005). In this case, participants were required
to perform ﬂexion movements by pressing buttons on a response
pad, alternating between left and right index ﬁngers between trials.
ERPs were time locked to movement onset and revealed differences
between athletes and non-athletes in the latency and amplitude of
movement potentials only for right ﬁnger ﬂexion (the ﬁnger used
for shooting). Potentials associated with preparation and execution of voluntary movement (i.e., the Bereitshaftpotential [−1500
to −500 ms] and Negative Slope [−500 to −50 ms]) were longer
and smaller in amplitude over central left-hemisphere locations in
riﬂe-shooters than for controls. This study is notable for targeting
speciﬁc aspects of physical control thought critical for riﬂe shooting. As for many of the simple lab based tasks discussed earlier
however, no direct reference was made to sporting context, leaving
it difﬁcult to assess whether differences between athletes and nonathletes are related to expertise acquired via training or heritable
traits predictive of expertise.
Analogous to the transition from simple lab based tasks to more
realistic sporting behavior described above for frequency domain
studies, neural changes in the response of experts during the observation of sports speciﬁc actions have also been revealed with ERPs.
For example, when presented with pictures of real attacks performed by elite athletes, and asked to indicate the side of attack,
fencing and karate athletes have been shown to exhibit differences in movement related potentials compared to non-athletes
(Del Percio et al., 2008). Here, ERPs were averaged time locked to

123

the onset of the motor response and analysis focused on potentials
associated with preparation (readiness potential) and initiation of
movement (motor potential) over central locations (C3, Cz, C4)
during the −1500 to −500 ms time interval preceding response.
Results revealed a reduction in the amplitude of readiness and
motor potentials in athletes, for right movements over supplementary motor (i.e., Cz) and contralateral sensorimotor (i.e., C3)
locations for both classes of athletes compared to non-athletes, and
higher amplitude motor potentials over the ipsilateral sensorimotor location (i.e., C4) for karate than for fencing athletes. Much like
ﬁndings from studies examining changes in alpha, these ERP ﬁndings were interpreted as supporting greater neural efﬁciency as a
function of training in elite athletes, whilst highlighting that the
development of neural efﬁciency in motor preparation and execution can depend upon the side of movement and may also be sports
speciﬁc.
As the preceding review highlights, the results from ERPs studies
examining movement potentials are somewhat variable, with both
increases and decreases in the amplitude of readiness and motor
potentials associated with sporting expertise. Changes in the pattern of results across studies could, of course, merely reﬂect sport
speciﬁc differences. Regardless, the variable nature of the ﬁndings
appears to stand in opposition to broader claims that there is a
direct mapping between the development of sporting activity (as
indexed by increasing levels of expertise) and neural efﬁciency
(as indexed by reductions in brain activity). Evidence contradicting claims of a relationship between greater neural efﬁciency and
higher expertise is, however, not limited to the sporting domain;
in the wider cognitive neuroscience literature better performance
has been associated with both increases and decreases in activation
(Gray et al., 2003; Haier et al., 2004). Clearly, care must be taken
when interpreting changes in the amplitude of ERP (or power of
frequency) effects; some aspects of the signal may reﬂect inhibition, while others may simultaneously reﬂect increased activation.
In addition to varying as a function of level of expertise, whether
patterns of activation, inhibition, or both are observed may depend
upon speciﬁc task demands and the exact nature of the sport in
question (Del Percio et al., 2011b). While ﬁndings relating to movement potentials are mixed, studies examining ERP effects related
to stimulus detection and response selection have produced more
consistent results.
4.2. Detection, evaluation and selection
Consistent changes in patterns of brain activity for athletes compared to non-athletes have been reported by studies employing
Go/No-go paradigms. Used in the wider literature to investigate
aspects of response control, this procedure involves the presentation of a series of cues that signal either action (Go trials) or
inhibition (No-go trials), with ERPs recorded time-locked to the
presentation of different cue types. When examined in typical (i.e.,
non-sports) populations, increases in the amplitude of N200 (a negative deﬂection occurring ∼200 ms after stimulus onset linked to
stimulus detection) and P300 (a positive deﬂection ∼300 ms after
stimulus onset linked to stimulus evaluation) potentials are commonly found for No-go trials, and are largely thought to reﬂect
aspects of response inhibition in this context (e.g., Falkenstein et al.,
1999; Bekker et al., 2005; Oddy et al., 2005). A similar pattern of
results has also been found in between-group comparisons of athletes and non-athletes. For example, contrasts between difference
waveforms (Go minus No-go) has shown that elite fencing athletes exhibit larger N200 effects at frontal locations, and larger P300
effects at frontal and parieto-occipital locations, than are seen for
non-athletes (Di Russo et al., 2006). While supporting the view that
expertise is facilitated by better attention to task relevant stimulus features and enhanced inhibition of planned responses, once

124

again the ﬁndings come from a study employing a simple lab based
task, with four abstract geometric conﬁgurations to signal Go/Nogo activity, making no reference to real sporting behavior.
The importance of examining neural activity in sports-relevant
contexts is highlighted in a study by Nakamoto and Mori (2008).
Here a lab based Go/No-go task was employed, comparing performance of baseball players and non-athletes, while manipulating
the sports-relevance of task cues. In a baseball condition, speciﬁc spatial locations acted as a cue for response execution or
inhibition (with the intention of mimicking cues provided during batting), whereas in the remaining experimental conditions
responses were made based on arbitrary stimulus location or color
(see Fig. 4a for schematic illustration of experimental conditions).
ERPs, time locked to stimulus onset, were formed for each group,
condition and response type, and analysis focused on readiness
potentials (from −600 ms prior to response), P300 effects for Go
trials (280–500 ms) and N200 and P300 effects for No-go trials
(150–250 ms, 280–500 ms). Results revealed that for the baseball
speciﬁc condition, readiness potentials were shorter lived for the
baseball group than for the control group, providing evidence for
a domain-speciﬁc advantage in motor preparation for expert players. In addition, for baseball players, P300 effects were larger in
amplitude for No-go trials in the baseball speciﬁc and color conditions, but were more pronounced at frontal sites for the baseball
speciﬁc condition, suggesting enhanced attention to sport-relevant
cues (see Fig. 4b). Taken together, these ﬁndings were interpreted
as providing evidence for domain speciﬁc response selection and
stronger inhibition as a function of expertise.
While the preceding study speciﬁcally aimed to examine sport
speciﬁc changes in neural activity, it still failed to fully capture
the dynamic nature of real-world baseball performance. A more
realistic approach was adopted by Nakamoto and Mori (2012) in a
baseball simulation study investigating movement correction and
the rate of motor reprogramming in expert and novice players.
An electronic trackway with LED lights was used to simulate the
approach of a moving target (see Fig. 5a), and the velocity of the
target was manipulated by introducing an occasional unexpected

slow ball simulation. ERPs were formed for fast and slow ball simulations, time locked to the onset of velocity change on slow balls,
and fast ball ERPs were subtracted from slow ball ERPs to eliminate
common activations. Results revealed that when presented with
slow balls, baseball experts exhibited faster onsetting N200 potentials over central locations, along with a delay in the peak latency
of P300 potentials, and an increase in the amplitude of P300 potentials over frontal locations (see Fig. 5b). Extending the ﬁndings from
the previous study, results were interpreted as reﬂecting faster
stimulus detection and stronger inhibition of planned responses
in experts.
Overall, the ERP studies reported in the preceding section
demonstrate that it is possible to identify patterns of brain activity related to speciﬁc stages of behavior. Moreover, these neural
mechanisms have been shown to be sensitive to sporting expertise. Evidence suggests that sensory, cognitive and motor processes
underlying skilled behavior in general, can also be identiﬁed as
playing a signiﬁcant functional role in expert sporting performance. As with work carried out to date in the frequency domain,
however, ERP studies largely fail to address the complexity of realworld sporting activity. Understanding expert performance and the
development of sporting behaviors through research applications
of mobile EEG clearly presents an opportunity for paradigm change.
The ability to capture neural signals and motor behavior measures
within ecologically valid environmental conditions will form one
basis for new understanding. At the very least, measuring actual
sports performance, rather than performance on abstract laboratory tasks (as the majority of existing studies have done) is likely
to lead to signiﬁcant advances in understanding.
Our review also reveals a clear opportunity for mobile EEG to be
used to ask different kinds of questions to those traditionally asked
by cognitive neuroscientists, more aligned to issues of interest to
sports professionals. For example, from a sports perspective it is
of interest to examine longitudinal changes in EEG within individuals – both as a basis for assessing changes in performance with
practice or coaching, but also for the purpose of identifying talent.

Ultimately, effective sports neuroscience measures should allow
the selection and development of talented individuals. As noted
earlier in the introduction, mobile EEG technology has advanced
sufﬁciently to open up research in this area; before outlining these
technological developments in more detail, the following section
will provide a selective review of the evidence supporting the application of neurofeedback techniques in sport.
5. Neurofeedback
Neurofeedback is a conditioning technique employed to teach
participants to modify their own neural activity, by facilitating the
recognition of speciﬁc mind/brain states associated with particular (i.e., desired) behavioral outcomes. In a typical neurofeedback
paradigm, participants have their EEG measured continuously and
a representation of their brain activity is communicated back to
them (see Fig. 6). Frequency analysis of the EEG is commonly used
to provide a rolling estimate of the power of particular bands (e.g.,
alpha, theta), and power levels can be shown graphically, represented by auditory tones, or via some form of illustration (e.g., a
balancing scale or moving ball). Over time, participants are able
to learn how their internal mental state correlates with the neural signal, allowing voluntary control to be exerted over entry to,
and maintenance of, particular states. A number of neurofeedback
protocols have been developed, relying on different neural signals, and used in different contexts. For example, Alpha-Theta (A/T)
training is often employed to encourage relaxation and reduce anxiety, by requiring participants to raise levels of theta over levels
of alpha (e.g., see Peniston and Kulkosky, 1991; Raymond et al.,
2005) or raise levels of alpha and theta together (e.g., see Peniston
and Kulkosky, 1989). By contrast, Sensory Motor Rhythm (SMR: see
Kober et al., 2014) training is used to reduce motor interference and
enhance cognitive performance, and participants are commonly
required to raise SMR (12–15 Hz) levels whilst controlling beta
levels.
Neurofeedback was originally applied in clinical contexts (e.g.,
Lubar and Shouse, 1976), with the aim of treating various psychological disorders, including anxiety, depression, Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Attention-Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). However, the goals of neurofeedback in clinical
populations differ dramatically from those of performance
enhancement in sport, where the aim is to take normal patterns
of activation and make them optimal (Wilson and Peper, 2011).

125

Indeed, rather than being interested in changes in neural patterns
per se, the aim for sports is simply to achieve changes in performance outcomes. Initial evidence supporting the viability of
neurofeedback techniques for performance enhancement in normal populations came from work demonstrating that increasing
power in speciﬁc frequency bands led to enhanced cognitive performance (e.g., Hanslmayr et al., 2005). While the potential to use
neurofeedback for performance enhancement in sport has been
recognized for some time, progress to date has been limited by a
lack of adequately controlled studies. Historically, however, criticism of neurofeedback techniques on these grounds has not been
limited to the ﬁeld of performance enhancement in normal populations; a general lack of validity was also apparent in early work
with clinical populations.
Recently, evidence has begun to accumulate validating the
use of speciﬁc neurofeedback protocols for enhancing aspects
of cognitive function in both clinical and normal populations,
driving renewed interest in the potential of neurofeedback techniques in general (e.g., Bazanova et al., 2009; Nan et al., 2012;
for discussion and review see Gruzelier, 2013). In the context
of optimizing aspects of sporting performance, however, application of neurofeedback still awaits thorough validation. Somewhat
surprisingly, despite dramatic growth over the last decade in
the number of sports related neurofeedback studies, some of the
strongest evidence supporting the efﬁcacy of the technique still
comes from the earliest work in the ﬁeld. For example, Landers
et al. (1991) studied the effectiveness of neurofeedback training
using 24 pre-elite archers randomly split into three treatment
groups. Alpha levels were recorded whilst participants made a
series of shots, and neurofeedback was provided visually. The correct feedback group received a single session of training where
the goal was to reduce left-temporal (T3) activation; the incorrect feedback group received training to reduce right-temporal
(T4) activation, and the control group received no training. As
would be expected, based on previous ﬁndings demonstrating that
left-hemisphere alpha levels are associated with expertise (see
Section 2.2), the correct feedback group showed an improvement
in performance following training, whilst the incorrect feedback group showed poorer performance post-training, and scores
for the control group did not differ. Despite this early positive
demonstration, however, contemporary research has made limited
progress in supporting the efﬁcacy of neurofeedback in sporting
contexts.

information on current status, to facilitate modiﬁcation of mental states.

J.L. Park et al. / Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 52 (2015) 117–130

In a recent study, for example, Brown et al. (2012) employed
a standardized SMR training protocol to enhance the accuracy of
serves in 10 elite table tennis athletes and demonstrated a trend
toward greater accuracy following neurofeedback training. Unfortunately, this effect failed to reach statistical signiﬁcance, and the
authors did not employ a control group, making it difﬁcult to interpret the results. Failure to ﬁnd signiﬁcant changes in performance
measures or patterns of brain activation following neurofeedback
training is not, however, uncommon. For example, Dekker et al.
(2014) employed self-guided eyes open alpha training over 10 sessions in 12 elite gymnasts in a double-blind and placebo-controlled
study. For the treatment group neurofeedback was provided by
linking alpha power to the auditory sound quality of music played
to participants. Results failed to demonstrate either a signiﬁcant
beneﬁt of training, or differences in baseline alpha levels between
treatment and control groups post-training. One potential concern for interpreting the results of this study is that music itself
affects the cognitive and psychomotor functions involved, potentially making any additional beneﬁts of neurofeedback difﬁcult to
identify. The study does, nonetheless, highlight that validation of
neurofeedback techniques in sport is still lacking. In short, these
studies fail to provide substantial behavioral or neural evidence
that supports the validity of neurofeedback training.
One potentially critical difference between these three studies is
the level of athletes employed, with signiﬁcant results only found
for pre-elite athletes (i.e., Landers et al., 1991). Whilst improvements in performance are, in principle, more difﬁcult to observe in
elite athletes (due to their existing high levels of expertise) than
in pre-elite or amateur athletes, signiﬁcant beneﬁts of neurofeedback training have, nonetheless, been reported for elite athletes.
In a longitudinal study, Rostami et al. (2012) compared the performance of 24 elite riﬂe shooters over the course of ﬁve weeks; half
formed a treatment group, receiving 3 sessions (60 minutes) of SMR
neurofeedback training per week, while the remainder formed a
control group receiving no training. The authors found a signiﬁcant
improvement in shot results for the neurofeedback group when
assessed post-training, but no difference in the control group. Interestingly, although the two studies described that have reported
signiﬁcant improvements employed different training protocols,
they both focused on target sports – suggesting that the potential efﬁcacy of neurofeedback may partially depend on the nature
of sport speciﬁc task demands. Equally, it is plausible that the predeﬁned neurofeedback protocols employed in these studies may
align with aspects of function that are more crucial for performance
in target sports than for sports such as table tennis and gymnastics. While delineating between these potential explanations lies
beyond the scope of the current review, the preceding discussion
hints at the need to develop sports speciﬁc training protocols.
Regardless of whether standardized neurofeedback protocols
turn out to be valid only for a subset of sporting behaviors, the
studies reviewed above all attempt to characterize the beneﬁts of
neurofeedback at a population level. As noted above, however, a
more critical issue for sports practitioners is to enhance the performance of individual athletes. Elite athletes are necessarily outliers –
they have acquired a level of expertise that cannot be accounted for
by practice alone. Indeed, a large number of athletes can complete
comparable training regimes as amateurs, but only a handful will
go on to develop expertise worthy of elite status. Consequently,
one critical question from the point of view of the sports practitioner is whether patterns related to success in different sports
are trainable via the application of EEG based neurofeedback on an
individual basis. Inter-individual differences in baseline frequencies suggest that the optimal pattern of training should not only be
sport speciﬁc, but should also be individually tailored.
Despite a number of authors commenting on its necessity (e.g.,
Hammond, 2007), to our knowledge only one study published to

date has assessed the application of individually tailored neurofeedback training during performance. In a novel and technically
ambitious study, Arns et al. (2008) created personalized proﬁles for
6 amateur golfers based on EEG recorded from electrode FPz during
the execution of 80 assessment putts. Activity proﬁles were formed
by averaging EEG across the assessment putts, and then identifying
frequency bands that exhibited differences in power between successful and unsuccessful putts during a 1-second pre-shot period.
These personal proﬁles were then applied during three sessions, on
three consecutive days. During training a tone was used to indicate
when the optimal neural pattern had been achieved, providing a
signal that the putt should be executed. On each day participants
performed four sets of 80 putts that alternated between no training
and training conditions in a blocked design. Results demonstrated
the presence of signiﬁcant increases in putting accuracy for training
compared to no training blocks on day 2, but no beneﬁt of training
was observed for day 3, with performance being lower overall than
on day 2 (see Fig. 7). In principle, this study illustrates the ideal use
of neurofeedback, yoked closely to active sporting behavior – with
the aim of enhancing performance on an individual level.
Although promising, the ﬁndings reported by Arns et al. (2008)
are not deﬁnitive, at least in part because the effects of neurofeedback were variable. The poor performance and absence of beneﬁt
seen for sessions 1 and 3 could have resulted from putting taking place outdoors (compared to indoors for session 2). Arguably,
outdoor conditions are associated with greater variability (e.g., due
to changes in lighting, wind, etc.) resulting in more difﬁcult task
demands in the outdoor sessions. Regardless, a greater concern
is the fact that whilst neurofeedback measures were tailored to
each individual, performance measures were not reported individually, making it difﬁcult to assess fully links between neural proﬁles
and performance enhancement. Notwithstanding these concerns,
the current study is the ﬁrst to demonstrate that personalized EEG
proﬁles related to success can be identiﬁed in the pre-shot period
and, tentatively, that they could be used to enhance performance
in individual athletes.
It is clear from the preceding discussion that ﬁndings from
the application of neurofeedback during sporting performance
are mixed, and further work in this area is warranted before
ﬁrm conclusions about the efﬁcacy of neurofeedback can be
reached. In a recent extensive review of the wider literature on
neurofeedback, Gruzelier (2014) identiﬁed a range of methodological ﬂaws, highlighting three key criteria for demonstrating
the validity of neurofeedback (i.e., speciﬁcity of frequency band,
behavioral outcome and topographic distribution). In depth discussion of these issues and other factors inﬂuencing the efﬁciency of

J.L. Park et al. / Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 52 (2015) 117–130

neurofeedback training (for discussion see Vernon et al., 2009;
Alexeeva et al., 2012; Bazanova, 2012) lie beyond the scope of the
current review, however, it is clear that validity conditions have
not yet been fully addressed in the domain of sports neuroscience.
For example, studies have focused on demonstrating improvements in behavioral performance, without aiming to demonstrate
post-training changes in the targeted frequency. While application of neurofeedback in sports is still in its infancy, lessons can
clearly be learned from the established literature in other areas.
Ultimately, neurofeedback has great potential as a training technique to enhance performance in sports, but still requires detailed
investigation and validation. At this stage, an essential requirement
is to better characterize differences in factors across sports, and
between individuals competing at the elite level, to provide an adequate knowledge base for effective application of neurofeedback
techniques, by measuring EEG during active sports performance.

6. Toward a mobile cognition approach
Over the course of this review we have highlighted that different patterns of neural activity are observed when sports relevant
activity is examined, compared to when simple lab based tasks are
employed. Consequently, if signiﬁcant progress is to be made in
the ﬁeld of sports neuroscience, imaging data needs to be collected
whilst athletes engage in real active sporting behavior, using ecologically valid paradigms. Real-world EEG data collection creates a
number of speciﬁc requirements however, including portability of
the equipment, ease of application and the ability to effectively handle motion artifacts. From the perspective of sports practitioners, it
is critical that mobile EEG equipment and procedures do not impede
sporting activity, or lead to signiﬁcant interruptions during training. From a neuroscience perspective, data quality is paramount,
and mobile systems must be able to deal with motion artifacts
effectively, whilst closely matching the performance of a lab-based
setup. Fortunately, as we outline below, over the last decade there
have been signiﬁcant developments in mobile EEG technology that
overcome many prior limitations and promise to make real-world
recording a routine practice.
The main advance in technology facilitating the movement of
EEG from the lab into the real-world has been the development
of small lightweight battery powered ampliﬁers. Recorded data
is typically saved to a portable hard-drive for later review and
analysis off-line, but can also be transmitted wirelessly in realtime to a PC or handheld device for on-line viewing. Consumer
technology currently available on the market includes wearable
headsets designed primarily for Brain Computer Interface (BCI)
applications (e.g., Emotiv [Hong Kong, ROC]; Neurosky [San Jose,
CA, USA]). Smaller devices also exist, employing a limited number of electrodes (i.e., that can be worn on a headband or on a
belt around the waist), designed primarily for use in psychophysiological monitoring and neurofeedback applications (e.g., B-Alert
X series [Advanced Brain Monitoring, Carlsbad, CA, USA]; Neurobit
Systems [Gdynia, Poland]). These devices were primarily developed
for personal applications such as gaming and health monitoring rather than for use in research per se. Nonetheless, the rapid
development of commercial equipment has demonstrated that it
is possible to produce truly mobile EEG technology, meeting the
portability requirements of sports practitioners. However, despite
enthusiastic adoption of mobile EEG across a range of applications,
the validity of these systems for use in pure research applications
was largely unaddressed.
At this stage, work validating mobile EEG technologies for use in
pure research applications is ongoing, but initial signs are promising. The bulk of studies to date seeking to validate mobile EEG
technology have focused on P300 effects, which provide a highly

127

reliable signal, observable even at a single trial level (e.g., Debener
et al., 2002; Blankertz et al., 2011). Whilst relevant for sporting
behavior, the focus on P300 effects in validation studies is primarily
driven by the utility of P300 effects for BCI research. For example, a
recent BCI study directly compared wireless mobile and traditional
ﬁxed ampliﬁers using a simple lab based task. Results revealed a
high degree of correlation in the amplitude and topography of P300
effects across systems, suggesting that it is now possible to capture
comparable EEG data using mobile ampliﬁers (De Vos et al., 2014a).
Whilst this study is important as a test of the basic validity of the
mobile equipment, demonstrating that a known neural signal can
be accurately measured, it does not address a key requirement: the
ability to record clear signals during motion.
A clear demonstration that reliable P300 effects can be obtained
during motion has been provided by studies employing oddball
tasks (i.e., where participants are required to report infrequent
targets presented within a stream of frequent non-targets). For
example, using EEG recorded indoors whilst seated versus outdoors
whilst walking, reliable single-trial P300 effects were obtained
using an auditory oddball task (Debener et al., 2012). In this case
the wireless setup used dry electrode sensors taken from a commercial Emotiv headset, ﬁtted into an elasticated cap with a small
head mounted ampliﬁer. Importantly, these ﬁndings were replicated in a more recent study employing the same mobile equipment
while participants walked freely outdoors (De Vos et al., 2014b).
Taken together, these studies conﬁrm the validity of mobile EEG
technology for capturing P300 effects during motion. While further validation will be required to assess measurement of other
sports-relevant patterns of brain activity in the ﬁeld, current ﬁndings support the view that advances in mobile equipment now
make this a genuine possibility.
Along with advances in EEG mobile technology, progress in signal processing has also made it possible to address some of the
issues traditionally associated with capturing neural data in active
sporting contexts (for discussion see Thompson et al., 2008). In
particular, spatial ﬁltering techniques such as Independent Components Analysis (ICA) can be applied to ERP data to dissociate brain
activity from movement artifacts. In basic terms, ICA uses the correlational structure of a dataset to decompose the observed ERP
waveform into a set of statistically independent constituent components that can then be apportioned as either signal of interest,
or noise (e.g., Vigário et al., 2000). Using an ICA approach, Gramann
et al. (2010) contrasted ERPs recorded using standard equipment
during a visual oddball task with four movement conditions: performed on a treadmill, standing, slow walking, fast walking and
running. Whilst the data from the running condition was excluded
due to the presence of large mechanical artifacts caused by movement in the cabling, results evidenced comparable P3 effects across
the remaining movement conditions, demonstrating that reliable
effects can be obtained during moderate whole body movement.
Overall, the evidence to date supports the view that developments in mobile EEG technology and progress in signal processing
now make it possible to monitor brain activity during active
sports performance. Moreover, recently, mobile EEG equipment
aimed speciﬁcally at sporting applications has become commercially available that can record up to 64-channels of high resolution
EEG – providing recording capabilities that have only been found
in lab-based systems to date (Eegosports [AntNeuro, Enschede,
Netherlands]). The combination of practical and technical developments means that EEG can be recorded whilst athletes engage in
normal sporting activity (see Fig. 8), ranging from playing a round
of golf to riding a bicycle. Whilst limits do still apply (e.g., recording during swimming or high-impact sports such as running), it
is clearly possible to monitor brain activity without signiﬁcantly
impeding the execution of a range of sporting behavior. The use of
mobile EEG data in active sporting contexts is, of course, likely to

possible to obtain full scalp coverage in the ﬁeld, without impeding sporting behavior, and equipment is ﬂexible enough to be well suited for use across a range of

task pictured above, providing an illustration of data quality during performance.

reveal new technical and methodological challenges. Equally, however, mobile EEG offers new opportunities for sports, including the
ability to track the brain activity of individual elite athletes, over
extended periods of time.
7. Conclusion
Despite early recognition of the potential utility of brain imaging for sports, the application of EEG techniques to assess factors
contributing to performance is still in its infancy. A number of limitations of work carried out in the literature to date have been
highlighted over the course of this review, including a general lack
of ecological validity, critical differences in methodology, a lack of
consistency in analysis strategy, and failure to address individual
differences. Here we highlight two issues of particular concern.
First, at present, a disconnect is often apparent between the evidence provided by EEG studies, and the functional interpretation
of the ﬁndings. For example, changes in alpha are interpreted as
reﬂecting changes in a range of different mechanisms, motivated

largely by a priori descriptions of the speciﬁc sport under investigation. Secondly, neurofeedback studies largely fail to report changes
in brain activity related to training, as improvements in behavioral
performance outcomes are of primary interest from the perspective
of sports practitioners. Notwithstanding these limitations, studies
to date do provide consistent evidence of neural correlates linked
to optimal sporting performance.
In the time-domain studies link expertise in response evaluation
and motor output with modulations of P300 effects and readiness
potentials, whilst in the frequency domain changes in alpha levels
are linked to development of expertise and performance outcomes.
One problem with work in this area is that it has primarily focused
on alpha rhythms, despite evidence from the wider literature
linking changes in other frequency bands with cognitive functions highly relevant to sports performance. For example, gamma
(>30 Hz) oscillations are modulated by sensory input and have been
linked to working memory, learning and attention (Jia and Kohn,
2011), and theta oscillations have been associated with cognitive
control and response inhibition (for a recent review see Cavanagh
and Frank, 2014). Progress in unraveling brain-behavior links during complex sporting performance, requires future research to
address these gaps in the literature, and in doing so, appreciate that complex brain functions are potentially supported by the
combined action across frequency bands (Başar, 2008). Notwithstanding this requirement for future research, on the basis of the
evidence reviewed here, it is clear that EEG measures have great
potential to provide insight into the neural underpinnings of expertise and optimal performance in sport.
While ﬁndings from EEG research with athletes have had limited
impact for sports practitioners, new opportunities afforded by
mobile technology are encouraging renewed interest from the
sporting world. Whilst it has been argued that “there will be no
emerging ﬁeld of neuro-sport” (Walsh, 2014), we disagree. The
development of mobile technologies allows cognitive neuroscientists to move out of the laboratory, examining real sporting
behavior in action. We believe that mobile methods add significant value to traditional ﬁxed methods, and open sport up to
investigation. On that basis we believe sports neuroscience will
make progress. Moving EEG out of the lab and onto the training
ﬁeld has the potential to not only facilitate better understanding of brain-behavior links, but also to produce new advances in
sporting practice. From a neuroscience perspective, measurement
of performance in the ﬁeld has a number of potential advantages.
In the ﬁrst instance, the high degree of ecological validity would
provide a more stringent test of the neural efﬁciency hypothesis,
and is likely to promote discovery of additional factors implicated in
performance that are not apparent in controlled laboratory studies. In addition, combined with sound methodology, longitudinal
tracking of individuals over the course of training with mobile EEG
should facilitate better identiﬁcation of commonalities and differences related to the development of expertise across sports and
between individuals. While at this stage it is difﬁcult to predict the
full extent of applications for mobile EEG techniques in sport, it
is clear that the development of a mobile cognition approach will
help sports neuroscience to provide valuable insights into the relationship between psychological and physical aspects of real-world
sporting performance.
