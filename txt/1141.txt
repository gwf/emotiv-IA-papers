The use of neuroscience tools to study consumer behavior and the decision making
process in marketing has improved our understanding of cognitive, neuronal, and
emotional mechanisms related to marketing-relevant behavior. However, knowledge
about neuroscience tools that are used in consumer neuroscience research is scattered.
In this article, we present the results of a literature review that aims to provide an
overview of the available consumer neuroscience tools and classifies them according
to their characteristics. We analyse a total of 219 full-texts in the area of consumer
neuroscience. Our findings suggest that there are seven tools that are currently used
in consumer neuroscience research. In particular, electroencephalography (EEG) and
eye tracking (ET) are the most commonly used tools in the field. We also find that
consumer neuroscience tools are used to study consumer preferences and behaviors
in different marketing domains such as advertising, branding, online experience, pricing,
product development and product experience. Finally, we identify two ready-to-use
platforms, namely iMotions and GRAIL that can help in integrating the measurements
of different consumer neuroscience tools simultaneously. Measuring brain activity and
physiological responses on a common platform could help by (1) reducing time and costs
for experiments and (2) linking cognitive and emotional aspects with neuronal processes.
Overall, this article provides relevant input in setting directions for future research and for
business applications in consumer neuroscience. We hope that this study will provide
help to researchers and practitioners in identifying available, non-invasive and useful tools
to study consumer behavior.

1. INTRODUCTION
Concepts, methodologies and tools in marketing have remained unchanged for a
relatively long period. However, changing market structures (e.g., offline to online,
globalization, hyper-competitive environment, increasing demand) demand new
marketing methodologies and tools that are able to adapt to this new situation
(Hackley, 2009; Armstrong et al., 2018). Thus, academics and practitioners have
investigated how marketing research could benefit from the integration of methods
and tools from other disciplines. In the early 2000s, a novel approach for studying

have considered academic articles indexed by Scopus published
between 2004 and 2019, as the first “neuromarketing” article was
published in 2004 (Brammer, 2004). The first paper that uses the
term “consumer neuroscience” was published in 2008 (Hubert
and Kenning, 2008).
As shown in Figure 1, we follow a three-step process to
select the studies for this review. First, we search academic
records on Scopus, using the following query, (“neuromarketing”
OR (“consumer” AND “neuroscience”)). This query returns
all the records that mention “neuromarketing” or “consumer
neuroscience” as a keyword. Due to a high number of records
(412 records) found, we decide to screen the studies by evaluating
their abstract and conclusions. We screen the records based on
the following parameters:

consumer behavior emerged. This new approach is now known
as Consumer Neuroscience (a.k.a. Neuromarketing) and lies at
the intersection of three disciplines: marketing, psychology, and
neuroscience (Plassmann et al., 2012).
The goal of consumer neuroscience is the study of
neuropsychological mechanisms that support and lead consumer
decision making and behavior. Consumer neuroscience uses
both psychological and neuroscience methods to investigate
marketing related issues concerning buying behavior, thus
offering scientific explanation on consumer’s preferences and
behaviors (Levallois et al., 2012; Russo et al., 2015). There are
multiple consumer neuroscience tools that are used to study
consumer decision-making and behavior. Usually, consumer
neuroscience tools include devices that can measure vital
physiological functions (e.g., heartbeat, respiration rate, blood
pressure) and reflexes (e.g., gaze fixation, pupil dilatation,
face expression) (Global Harmonization Task Force, 2012).
These tools reveal information about impressions, reactions
(e.g., positive, negative) and emotional responses (e.g., positive,
negative) when exposed to marketing stimuli (Hamelin et al.,
2017). Consumer neuroscience tools also allow real-time
measurements of brain activity, such as functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG).
These tools measure the neural activity of consumers while they
perform consumption-related behavior (e.g., buying or testing a
product), or in the periods directly preceding and following such
behaviors (Plassmann et al., 2015; Montazeribarforoushi et al.,
2017).
Many studies have focussed on the benefits of neuroscience
tools in marketing (Vecchiato et al., 2011; Bercea, 2013; Hsu and
Yoon, 2015; Ramsøy, 2015; Boz et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2017;
Alvino, 2019; Songsamoe et al., 2019). Several studies also provide
an overview of the most common neuroscience tools that could
be used in consumer neuroscience tools, for instance EEG and
fMRI. However, there is lack of literature that surveys these tools
to provide guidance for practitioners and researchers. The aim of
this article is to provide an overview of the use and characteristics
of neuroscience tools employed for studying consumer behavior.
In order to achieve our aim we make use of a literature review
as explained in section 2. After selecting relevant publications we
first study the classification criteria used to categorize consumer
neuroscience tools and propose criteria to classify those
practically used tools in section 3. We then discuss the various
characteristics of the consumer neuroscience tools in section 4.
Thereafter, in section 5, we study the various applications of
consumer neuroscience tools in marketing. Section 6 describes
the benefits and potential of two novel ready-to-use platforms
that integrate different consumer neuroscience tools together.
Finally, we present the conclusions of our study in section 7.

1. We remove the records that did not focus on neuromarketing
or consumer neuroscience as a research topic.
2. We only consider records in the English language.
3. We exclude the studies that were not marketing related.
Post screening a total of 211 studies were found eligible for this
survey. Finally, we add 8 more records to the eligible studies
based on suitable studies (including books and reports) found
as a result of backward reference search. We select 219 studies
that belong to several domains where consumer neuroscience
is a research topic, for example, neuroscience, marketing,
psychology, economics and engineering in this survey. We
further evaluate the studies and group them according to
the following three categories: review, empirical (based on
experiments) and conceptual (based on interviews). In the
selected corpus we find 137 empirical research, 69 review, 9
conceptual papers, and 4 reports.
Figure 2 shows the year of publication of the selected
studies. We recorded the tools discussed by each study and
the tools employed for data collection in each empirical
study. We recorded the various characteristics (e.g., advantages,
disadvantages, cost of procurement, etc.) of the tools mentioned
in the studies. In addition, we recorded the classification
criteria used by the studies to categorize the tools, the
marketing domain of application and the type of product
or service tested. Based on the review of selected studies,
we develop insights in order to achieve the objective of
this review.

3. AN OVERVIEW OF CONSUMER
NEUROSCIENCE TOOLS
Consumer neuroscience uses neuroscience tools to study
behavior of consumers and their decision-making processes.
Traditional marketing techniques such as self-reports or
interviews mainly allow the measurement of conscious reactions
to marketing-related stimuli (e.g., advertisements, brands).
Conversely, neuroscience tools enable researchers to measure
physiological signals aroused by marketing stimuli such as music,
videos, brand logo, or websites (Schneider and Woolgar, 2015;
Alvino et al., 2018; Alvino, 2019; Muñoz-Leiva et al., 2019).

2. METHOD
We use a literature review methodology (Webster and Watson,
2002) to survey the scientific contributions and construct an
overview of the use and characteristics of neuroscience tools
used to study consumer behavior. For the literature review, we

criteria that identify, group, and properly name tools via a
standardized system.

These tools also help to understand how a consumer
experiences marketing stimuli and to identify the factors that
influence and modify consumers’ preferences. There are several
definitions and descriptions of consumer neuroscience tools
(Fugate, 2008; Fisher et al., 2010; Morin, 2011; Gang et al.,
2012; Venkatraman et al., 2015; Chapman et al., 2019; Lajante
and Ladhari, 2019; Tobon et al., 2020). In this section, we
focus on classifications of neuroscience tools as classification

Frontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

3.1. Classification of Tools
Consumer Neuroscience tools are usually categorized based on
the type of measurements. Studies (Kenning et al., 2007a; Boz
et al., 2017; Stasi et al., 2018) have broadly divided these tools into
two categories namely physiological tools and neurophysiological

3

tools. Physiological tools can measure voluntary and involuntary
reflexes such as fixating and tracking visual stimuli or movements
of the mimetic musculature of the face (facial expressions)
(Global Harmonization Task Force, 2012). Physiological tools
(or methods) include electrocardiogram (ECG), electrodermal
activity (EDA), participants’ facial muscles fEMG, eye-tracker
(ET) and voice pitch analysis (VOPAN) (Isabella et al., 2015;
Boz et al., 2017; Stasi et al., 2018). Neurophysiological tools (or
methods) measure and record brain activity to study consumer
behavior (Boz et al., 2017). Examples of neurophysiological
tools are electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission
tomography (PET), magnetoencephalogaphy (MEG), functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) (Kenning et al., 2007a,b).
Literature (Wang and Minor, 2008; Bercea, 2013; Fortunato
et al., 2014; Harris et al., 2018; Lim, 2018) shows that these tools
can also be classified based on the type of brain activity they
measure; i.e., tools that:

transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and neurotransmitters
(NTs). Neurotransmitters are chemical substances that enable the
transmission of neurological signals from one neuron to another
target neuron (Lim, 2018).
Finally, Ramsøy (2015) identifies four different types of consumer
neuroscience tools, namely:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Self-report is one of the most widely used methods of collecting
information regarding individual health status, feelings, attitudes,
and beliefs. For example, it might be important to know how
participants feel while shopping in a store or while performing
a task (Paulhus and Vazire, 2007). Behavioral measurements
reveal information about consumer behaviors, impressions, and
concern particular mental states or responses (Ramsøy, 2015).
In behavioral measurements, people are observed and recorded
when they perform a task, for instance, reaction time (RT),
which is the opposite of self-report. Physiological measurements
are useful to evaluate people’s biological responses to stimuli.
Physiological measurements are usually not under a consumer’s
voluntary control, therefore they cannot be easily influenced, in
contrast to self-reports and behavioral measurements (Ramsøy,
2015). Examples of physiological measurements are body
language, facial expression, eye movement and pupil dilatation,
palm sweating, respiration and pulse. Finally, neuroimaging
refers to different tools that are used to identify and analyse
brain activity. Ramsøy (2015) classifies as neuroimaging tools
EEG, fMRI, MRI, PET MEG, and single photon emission
tomography (SPECT).
We identify three classification criteria used in the literature
for categorizing neuroscience tools. There are some similarities
between some of the classifications, for instance, (Isabella et al.,
2015) with (Boz et al., 2017) or (Wang and Minor, 2008) with
(Bercea, 2013) and (Harris et al., 2018); we observe that those
authors chose different criteria to group consumer neuroscience
tools. As shown in Table 1, previous studies group consumer
neuroscience tools in different number of levels (2, 3, or 4)
on the base of (1) type of measurements (e.g., behavioral,
physiological, neurophysiological), (2) type of neuronal activity
(neuronal activity outside or inside the brain), (3) brain activity
recorded (e.g., metabolic or electric), (4) no brain activity, or
(5) manipulate neuronal activity. Surprisingly, some of these
classifications also describe these tools erroneously. While some
authors classify them as data collection methods (and not tools),
some other authors mistake the tools for measurements. E.g.,
some authors describe eye tracking, heart rate and electrodermal
activity (skin conductance) as tools, instead of properties of the
human body or, more precisely, changes in eye movements,
muscle contraction of the heart and electrical properties of the
skin (Wiles and Cornwell, 1991; Braithwaite et al., 2013; Ramsøy,
2015). Some authors also refer to the Implicit Association Test
as a tool, however, the IAT is a test that can be used to measure
the strength of differential association of two or more target

1. Measure the metabolic activity in the brain
2. Measure electrical activity in the brain
3. Do not measure brain activity.
Wang and Minor (2008) identifies three tools that measure
changes in chemical composition or changes in the flow
of fluids in the brain (brain imaging analysis), namely
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron
emission tomography (PET), transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS) or magnetoencephalogaphy (MEG). In contrast,
electroencephalography (EEG) and steady-state topography
(SST) measure non-hemispheric brain wave analysis and
hemispheric lateralization (brain wave analysis). Bercea (2013)
states that PET and fMRI can record metabolic brain activity
and that EEG, SST, TMS, MEG and functional near-infrared
spectroscopy (fNIRS) can record electrical brain activity.
According to Harris et al. (2018), changes in metabolic brain
processes are measured by fMRI, PET and functional transcranial
Doppler sonography (fTCS). In contrast, changes in electrical
activity are measured by various techniques including EEG,
MEG, SST, and TMS. The tools that do not record brain
activity can be considered physiological tools such as galvanic
skin response (GSR), electrocardiogram (ECG), eye tracking
(ET), facial expression recognition software (fERS), voice pitch
analysis, and implicit association tests (IAT) (Wang and Minor,
2008; Bercea, 2013; Fortunato et al., 2014; Harris et al., 2018).
Similarly, Lim (2018) classifies consumer neuroscience tools into
three categories, i.e., tools that:
1. Record outside brain activity
2. Record inside brain activity
3. Manipulate neural activity.
In the first category, we find tools such as GSR, ECG, ET,
and fERS. The second category (tools that record neural
activity) is then divided into two categories: electromagnetic and
metabolic. PET and fMRI can record metabolic brain activity,
and EEG, MEG, SST can record electrical brain activity (Lim,
2018). In the last category (manipulate neural activity), we find

concepts with an attribute (Greenwald et al., 1998; Ramsøy,
2015). Finally, Lim (2018) consider neurotransmitters (NT) as
consumer neuroscience methods. However, NTs are chemical
substances in our brain and cannot be considered a method or
a tool.
There is a difference in the number and type of tools that
authors include in each classification (see Table 1). All authors
included tools such as EEG, fMRI, MEG, PET, fERS, ET, ECG,
and GSR as consumer neuroscience tools (Wang and Minor,
2008; Bercea, 2013; Ramsøy, 2015; Boz et al., 2017; Harris et al.,
2018; Lim, 2018). However, other tools such as fNIRS, TMS, SST,
and VPA have not been mentioned in all classifications. Selfreports and reaction time are only discussed by Ramsøy (2015).
This observation suggests that some authors identify as consumer
neuroscience tools only those most commonly employed in
neuroscience studies.

studies also use self-reports, questionnaires and/or reaction times
to measure behavioral measurements. In addition, we found that
approximately 18% of the total number of studies (25 studies) use
a combination of two or more tools simultaneously.
Another important aspect to consider is the popularity of
these tools in consumer neuroscience research. The literature
suggests that several tools are in demand in the field. Some studies
claim that the majority of consumer neuroscience research
has predominantly used fMRI to measure brain activation in
response to marketing stimuli (Smidts et al., 2014; Ramsøy,
2015; Harris et al., 2018). Other studies maintain that the
most widely applied consumer neuroscience tool is eye-tracking
followed by galvanic skin response (16%), facial recognition
(11%), heart rate variability (9%), electroencephalography (6%),
and electromyography (EMG) (4%) (dos Santos et al., 2015; Boz
et al., 2017). A review of 34 neuroscience studies from 2001 to
2012 finds that fewer than 25% of the studies applied EEG, while
almost 70% applied fMRI (Solnais et al., 2013; Sung et al., 2019).
Similarly, Lim (2018) outlines that neuroimaging is the most
popular category of tools for consumer neuroscience research (33
articles; 42.3%), followed by non-neuroimaging tools (16 articles;
20.5%). In particular, (Lim, 2018) outlines that the most popular
brain recording method is fMRI and EEG is the second most
popular tool.
In the literature review we found that most consumer
neuroscience studies use EEG (both traditional and wearable).
In total, EEG was used in 83 studies (approx. 60.5%), alone
or in combination with other tools (see Figure 3). In 19 of
these studies, researchers used wearable EEG. Eye tracking is the
second-most used tool, appearing in 24 studies (approx. 17.5%
of the studies). Interestingly, fMRI was used only in 20 studies

3.2. Popularity of Tools
Even though a large number of tools are proposed for consumer
neuroscience research, it might be possible that the number of
tools that are practically used for research is much lower. In our
analysis, we did not find evidence of practical use for some of
the proposed tools. In total, we analyzed 137 empirical research
papers in consumer neuroscience research and we find that only
seven tools are used in these studies. In particular, we see that
some studies use tools that measure brain activity such as EEG
(both traditional and wearable), fMRI and fNIRS. In addition,
other studies use tools that measure physiological responses such
as ECG, ET, GSR, and fERS. Surprisingly, tools such as MEG,
SST, SPECT, PET, TMS, and VPA are not used in the studies
in our search. However, it is noteworthy that many of these

FIGURE 3 | An overview of neuroscience tools used in consumer neuroscience studies.

(approx. 14.5%). As shown in Figure 3, fERS was found in 13
studies (almost 9.5%), followed by GSR (8%), fNIRS (almost
6.6%), and ECG (approx. 5%). These results are in line with a
survey conducted by the Neuromarketing Science and Business
Association (NMSBA) in 2018. The survey provides a ranking
of the most to the least offered tools offered by neuromarketing
vendors, namely EEG, ET, fERS and GSR. fMRI shows a small
decline during the period 2014–2018 (Cherubino et al., 2019).
Overall, we identify seven tools that are used to measure
consumer brain activity or physiological responses to marketing
stimuli. Additionally, we find that many consumer neuroscience
studies also employ traditional marketing tools such as surveys,
questionnaires and self-reports. It might be possible that some
tools are listed as consumer neuroscience tools but they have
never been used before (e.g., MEG, PET, TMS, SST, SPET, VPA).
We also believe that some of these tools such as PET and TMS
should not be used in consumer neuroscience research. Whilst
these tools are very helpful for medical diagnosis and treatment of
mental diseases, they may be too invasive or have adverse effects
(e.g., pain, fainting, seizures) that could be too high to be used
in consumer neuroscience studies, thus exposing participants to
unnecessary risks (Rossi et al., 2009; Dobek et al., 2015). Similarly,
we believe that SPET and SST are not useful for consumer
neuroscience research. SPET is very similar to PET and has the
same disadvantages such as costs and high risk for the subject. In
fact, SPET requires an injection of radiopharmaceuticals which is
risky and arguably unethical. Finally, SST could not be considered
as a neuroscience tool because it is a particular application of
EEG. The available literature seems to support the view that
fMRI and eye-tracking are the most used tools in consumer
neuroscience studies. On the contrary, we find that EEG is the
most popular tool used in consumer neuroscience studies by
far, followed by eye-tracking. fMRI is only the third-most used

Frontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

tool in the field. There could be several reasons why fMRI is
considered the most popular tool. Many papers were published
4–5 years ago, and might not reflect the current situation.
Perhaps the fact that fMRI is broadly discussed in popular studies
such as (McClure et al., 2004; Plassmann and Karmarkar, 2015;
Venkatraman et al., 2015) gives the false impression that this tool
is widely used in consumer neuroscience research.

3.3. Proposed Classification of Tools
Based on the above considerations, we propose a new
classification following Isabella et al. (2015) and Ramsøy (2015)
classifications. Figure 4 shows that consumer neuroscience tools
can be divided in three categories, namely:
1. Behavioral,
2. Physiological,
3. Neurophysiological.
Behavioral tools (e.g., survey, observations, and RT) are part
of our classification as they provide important information on
behavior of consumers. These tools are also presently used in
consumer neuroscience studies. We also do not differentiate
between self-report and survey, as we believe self-report has a
different purpose in this field than in psychology. In consumer
neuroscience, self-reports are not used to assess personality but
purchasing behavior and attitude of consumers (Paulhus and
Vazire, 2007).
For both physiological and neurophysiological tools, we only
include tools that are currently used in consumer neuroscience
research. In our classification, physiological tools such as ECG,
ET, fERS, and GSR can measure the autonomous functions of
the body for which there is no direct or conscious control, such
as blood circulation, blood pressure, heart rate and sweating
(Kenning and Linzmajer, 2011). These tools allow researchers to

FIGURE 4 | Proposed classification of consumer neuroscience tools.

These potentials, whose amplitude is tiny, are then amplified,
digitized and then transmitted to a personal computer for
processing and storage. EEG measures the potential difference
(i.e., the voltage) between two electrodes (Kane et al., 2017).
Electrodes can be made of various materials. Usually, EEG
electrodes are made of metal plates and they are applied to the
scalp using a conducting electrode gel. However, there has been
an increase in the use of dry electrodes (no gel needed) in recent
years (see next subsection). The positioning of the electrodes on
the scalp has been standardized worldwide in the so called 10–20
international system (Klem et al., 1999).
Electrophysiological techniques usually have an excellent
temporal resolution but poor spatial resolution (Burle et al.,
2015). In general, EEG allows the detecting of the activity
generated in the cortex only, and not in deeper brain structures
because of the presence of the scalp’s bones, the cerebrospinal
fluid and the dura mater which act as filters for high
frequencies. However, EEG spatial resolution (about 1 cm)
can be increased using high-density EEG caps (128 electrodes
or more).
In the temporal domain, EEG can measure Event Related
Potentials (ERPs). ERPs are very small voltages generated in
the brain in response to sensory, motor or cognitive events or
stimuli (Blackwood and Muir, 1990). In the frequency domain,
an EEG signal can be analyzed in different frequency bands,
namely delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma (Rahman et al., 2015).
This analysis can be used in consumer neuroscience research
to investigate cognitive processes such as attention, arousal,
emotion, engagement, excitement, memory, reward, sensory
perception and valence (see section 5) (Vecchiato and Babiloni,

measure the autonomous functions of the body (e.g., voluntary
and involuntary body reflexes). Neurophysiological tools can
directly measure consumers’ brain activity and can be further
divided into two categories: those that measure electrical
activity (EEG), and those that measure metabolic brain activity
(fMRI and fNRIS). The characteristics of physiological and
neurophysiological tools are discussed in the next section.

4. CHARACTERISTICS OF CONSUMER
NEUROSCIENCE TOOLS
In this section, we discuss the details of the seven tools currently
used in consumer neuroscience research (identified in section 3).
We illustrate the cognitive processes which these tools can be
used to investigate, and the main advantages and disadvantages
for each tool. Secondly, we provide an estimate of average costs
of procuring the tools and the average time it takes to perform
an experiment. We also discuss the ease with which a tool
can be used in tandem with another tool; we represent this
as the integration level of a tool. Table 2 provides an aggregate
view of all the above-mentioned characteristics for each of the
neuroscience tools.

4.1. Electroencephalogram
EEG can be considered the oldest neurophysiological tools,
dating back almost a century (1924) (Murray and Antonakis,
2019). EEG is a non-invasive brain imaging method that detects
brain electrical activity using different electrodes placed on the
scalp (Berger, 1929). The electrodes measure small electrical
potentials that reflect the activity of neurons within the brain.

and Lahiri, 2016; Dulabh et al., 2018).
EEG carries a relatively low cost for the equipment and
tests. Depending on how many electrodes are used (and the
technology employed), the estimated average cost is between
ten and thirty five thousands euros per study (Lystad and
Pollard, 2009). However, EEG also requires human resources
for acquisition and analysis, as well as consumables. For setting
up a consumer neuroscience experiment, an EEG technician
and/or a data analyst to analyse data are required. A neurologist
might also be required to check the quality and the reliability
of the EEG signals. The average time for the preparation of a
single experiment is between 30 min and 1 h, depending on the
caps and the number of electrodes. The the time to set-up the
experiment and the time to execute the experiment need to be
added. EEG is characterized by a medium level of integration
with the other neuroscience tools because it can be used in
combination with various other tools, depending on the specific
EEG hardware. Compared to other neurophysiological tools,
EEG is more tolerant toward small physical movements made by
the participant during an experiment.

is pre-amplified and transmitted wirelessly to the EEG amplifier
through the base station.
Wearable EEG allows researchers to measure the same
cognitive phenomena detectable with classical EEG. Wearable
EEG is very popular in consumer neuroscience research due
to increased subject mobility. We find that wearable EEG was
used to investigate consumer behavior for e-commerce products
and to measure users’ emotional responses while watching
products prior to purchase or product placement effectiveness
(Murugappan et al., 2014; Yadava et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2018).
There are many different types of wearable EEG devices
available on the market. Compared to traditional EEG, wearable
EEG systems or headset devices are usually less expensive,
because they have a low number of EEG channels. EEG headsets
like Emotiv, OpenBCI, NeuroSky range from e500 up to a
maximum of a few thousand euros (Lystad and Pollard, 2009).
However, there are other more expensive wearable EEG devices
(e.g., Nautilus from g.tec medical engineering) that have a higher
number of electrodes and a higher performance. These devices
can cost up to tens of thousands euros. Wearable EEG systems
measure similar brain phenomena as the traditional EEG system.
Compared to classical EEG systems, wearable EEG devices allow
more liberty of movement for the subject. In addition, the average
time for the preparation of the subject is less compared to
traditional EEG (setup time of less than 5–6 min for Emotiv,
Muse, and openBCI) (Qiu et al., 2019). Wearable EEG devices

4.2. Wearable Electroencephalogram

devices. A wearable EEG device consists of a portable cap, a base
station and a pre-amplifier. The signal collected from electrodes

also have a higher level of integration compared to classical EEG
devices because they are portable. Recent studies suggest that
wearable EEG systems are capable of collecting neural signals,
the quality of which is comparable with those collected by the
traditional EEG systems in a controlled laboratory environment
(Schiff et al., 2016; Kam et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2019). However,
studies show that wearable EEG systems are more prone to
artifacts from muscle movements (Badcock et al., 2013; Ratti
et al., 2017; Qiu et al., 2019). Some studies also suggest that
the signal of wearable EEG might be delayed in comparison
to traditional EEG systems (Qiu et al., 2019). For academic
purposes, the use of more complex (thus, more expensive) EEG
systems, together with expert personnel, is highly recommended,
since it provides a higher quality and a more reliable signal.

30 min, which includes the time for the preparation of the subject
and the time to acquire the images.
In the literature, we find that fMRI is the second most
used neuroimaging tool in consumer neuroscience experiments.
In fact, fMRI scanners are easily available compared to other
neuroimaging tools. Several fMRI studies investigate many
cognitive phenomena, such as sensory perception, attention,
arousal, emotion, engagement, memory, reward and valence
(McClure et al., 2004; Deppe et al., 2005; Esmaeili et al., 2011;
Santos et al., 2012; Ruanguttamanun, 2014; Sebastian, 2014;
Koestner et al., 2016; Shen and Morris, 2016). fMRI is a suitable
tool to study consumer preferences for visual stimuli (e.g., videos,
images). However, fMRI might not be suitable if researchers
want to replicate exact “real-world circumstances,” for example
touching the product or drinking from a glass. In fact, fMRI
restricts participants’ movements considerably, as they lie in a
narrow tube (Alvino et al., 2019). Overall, fMRI may have a
restricted external validity compared to other tools (e.g., EEG).
There are some safety concerns on the use of this tool. Although
fMRI can not be not considered an invasive tool, many subjects
can suffer due to the noise of the machine (especially for fMRI
sequences), the small space (claustrophobia, vertigo, nausea) and
potential movement or heating of ferromagnetic objects in the
body (e.g., pacemakers, surgical clip). For these reasons, subjects
might not be able to complete the scan (Lystad and Pollard, 2009).
Finally, fMRI has a low level of integration with other tools, due
to the presence of magnetic fields. Thus, it can be integrated only
with devices compatible with magnetic fields.

4.3. Functional Magnetic Resonance
Imaging
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a metabolic
brain imaging method used to analyse regional, time-varying
changes in brain metabolism (Ogawa et al., 1990; Bandettini et al.,
1992; Kwong et al., 1992). fMRI measures the BOLD (Blood
Oxygenation Level Dependent) response by tracking the changes
in the blood flow indicated by the relative amounts of different
forms of haemoglobin. fMRI was introduced by Ogawa in 1990,
so it is can be considered a “younger” tool compared to EEG
(Murray and Antonakis, 2019).
fMRI can be used to produce activation maps showing which
parts of the brain are involved in a certain process. These
metabolic changes can (1) be induced by the execution of a
specific motor or cognitive task or as a result of a stimulus (taskrelated fMRI), or (2) be the result of uncontrolled processes in
the brain at rest, in absence of a stimulus or a task (restingstate fMRI) (Ogawa et al., 1990; Bandettini et al., 1992; Kwong
et al., 1992). The fMRI modality used in consumer neuroscience
research is the task-related fMRI. Thus, activation maps are
produced by comparing BOLD level contrast between active
periods (e.g., performing a task or exposed to a stimulus) and
rest periods.
fMRI is widely used due to its widespread availability, its
non-invasive nature (does not require injection of a radioisotope
or other pharmacologic agent), and good spatial resolution
(about 1 mm). In contrast, it has a poor temporal resolution
(Burle et al., 2015). fMRI allows for analysis of hemodynamic
activity in small structures and even those brain structures
that are deep in the brain, which are usually involved in
emotional responses (e.g., amygdala and accumbens). fMRI is
very expensive. In a hospital or research center setting, the typical
cost of a fMRI scan is between e500 and 800, while a fMRI
scanner costs not less than e1 million (Lystad and Pollard, 2009).
To have valuable and reliable data, an fMRI experiment requires
a psychologist or neuroscientist who sets up the fMRI task, an
MRI technician who performs the experiment, a physicist who
set ups the hardware to acquire the right brain responses and
a biomedical engineer (or the same physicist) who analyses the
data. The average time for the execution of an fMRI scan is about

Frontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

4.4. Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy
Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive,
metabolism-based brain imaging technique. It measures change
in the blood’s color when oxygen is delivered to brain tissue (only
the top few mm of cortex) (Villringer et al., 1993; Boas et al., 2004;
Burle et al., 2015). fNIRS, similarly to fMRI, is a BOLD-response
technology that measures the changes in the relative levels of
oxyhemoglobine (oxy-Hb) and deoxyhemoglobine (deoxy-Hb)
during brain activity. When a subject performs a task, brain
activity increases in those brain areas relevant to the task due to
changes in oxy- and deoxy-Hb (Ernst et al., 2013).
fNIRS is relatively easy to use as its technology supports fast
data acquisition from numerous positions (Ehlis et al., 2005;
Sitaram et al., 2009). Its temporal resolution is relatively good
(few seconds), but it seems to be lower in comparison to EEG. In
addition, fNIRS cannot be applied when the focus of the research
is the investigation of cognitive processes which rely on deeper
structures of the brain. In fact, fNRIS’s spatial resolution is very
low, making it difficult to distinguish between cortical areas that
are positioned close to each other.
We find that the use of fNIRS in consumer neuroscience
research is very recent. fNIRS is used to investigate consumer
attention, arousal, emotions, sensory perception, and valence,
especially for mobile technologies (Plichta et al., 2011; Ernst et al.,
2013; Cakir et al., 2018; Krampe et al., 2018). In general, fNIRS
is easily available for economic researchers (Shimokawa et al.,
2009; Weiskopf, 2012; Kober et al., 2014). fNIRS is a noise-free
neuroimaging tool, and thus it can be very useful in studies in

To have more reliable results, ET should be used in combination
with other tools.

which auditory stimuli play an important role (unlike fMRI)
(Plichta et al., 2011). The low sensitivity of motion artifacts also
creates strong potential for fNIRS and its application in real world
scenarios (Nambu et al., 2009; Lloyd-Fox et al., 2010; Kober et al.,
2014).
fNIRS equipment is portable and inexpensive compared to
other blood-flow measurement technologies, such as fMRI.
fNRIS’s price is around e10.000, but it can go up to e200.000
(depending on the technique and associated electronics). An
fNIRS experiment needs at least an expert technician to perform
the experiment and a data analyst. The average time needed
to perform an fNIRS session is about 1 h, which includes
the time for the preparation of the subject (measurements of
anatomical landmarks, positioning of the cap, digitization of
the positions of the sensors) and the time to perform the
experiment, which usually takes place in a block-design paradigm
experiment, alternating active periods with rest periods. fNIRS,
particularly the portable version, is characterized by a good level
of integration with other consumer neuroscience tools.

4.6. Facial Expression Recognition
Software
Facial expressions are important metrics of subjects’ emotions.
They are usually divided into two main categories: observable
and unobservable (Fortunato et al., 2014). The analysis of
facial expression is divided into two main classes, namely facial
electromyography (fEMG) and facial expression recognition
software. The former category measures voluntary and
involuntary facial muscle movements reflecting emotional
reactions toward a marketing stimulus (Bercea, 2013; Cherubino
et al., 2019). The latter category is based on the use of specific
software to record and analyse facial expressions based on
decision classifiers, and is able to predict a purchase substantially
above the chance level.
Facial expression recognition software (fERS) can be used
to measure positive or negative reactions to marketing stimuli
(e.g., videos). fERS is a valuable tool to investigate consumers’
excitement, engagement, emotions and valence (Ângelo et al.,
2013; Hamelin et al., 2017; Hernández-Fernández et al., 2019).
There are many facial recognition software platforms in
the market. For example, Software iMotions Neuromarketing
combines different sensors and is able to detect a subject’s
attention, valence and emotions (iMotions, 2020). In contrast,
the Facial Action Coding System is an online platform to
measure emotions and understand human behavior through
face analysis2 .
The costs of an fERS are highly variable and depend mainly on
how many integrated sensors the platform is able to manage. If
we consider only the platform (excluding the sensors), the cost of
such software can be around a few thousand euros. Conducting
an experiment using facial recognition expression requires one
technician to acquire face data and a technical expert for data
analysis. The average time needed to perform such an experiment
is 15–20 min. No subject preparation is required. Finally, this
tool is characterized by a high level of integration with other
consumer neuroscience tools. fERS is portable, very easy to use
and can manage the data of various sensors. Using only fERS
has a limited application for consumer neuroscience research,
as it does not measure important cognitive processes such as
attention, memory and sensory perception.

4.5. Eye Tracking
An eye tracker (ET) is a device that allows the measurements of
eye positions, eye movement and pupil dilatation. Researchers
can use ET to measure how information on the screen is
related to behavioral and emotional responses (Wang, 2011). ET
measurements are fixation (looking at a specific place), length of
fixation (how long a person looks), saccades (fast eye movement)
and pupil dilation responses (changes in pupil size) (Wang,
2011). ET technologies usually measure eye gaze and movements
at specific (and fixed) points on images or videos. However, there
are more advanced devices that allow the automatic tracking
of the user’s head position and movement (Zurawicki, 2010).
Such enhancements make the measurement process more subtle,
with very little or no interaction between the researchers and
their subjects. In the market, there are two types of ET devices
available, namely fixed ones, which are integrated in another
device (i.e., a computer monitor) and wearable ones, which
consist of spectacles with integrated cameras.
ET has been widely used in consumer neuroscience research
to study visual behavior (e.g., fixation, gaze, pupil dilatation),
customers’ visual attention mechanisms and consumers’
engagement (Zamani et al., 2016; Ungureanu et al., 2017). ET has
several advantages: it is portable, non-invasive, simple to use and
relatively inexpensive. ET has a cost ranging between e100,000
and 300,000, depending on the level of the technology and
whether the software to acquire and analyse data is included1 .
An ET experiment needs only a technician and, eventually, a data
analyst. The average time needed to perform an ET experiment
is about 15 min since the subject set-up is very fast. This time
covers only the time needed to perform the experiment by the
subject. Not all the ET has a high flexibility as some ET models
might not work efficiently with glasses and contact lenses. ET is
also characterized by a high level of integration with other tools
due to its portability and because it is a “ready-to-use” device.

4.7. Electrocardiogram
Electrocardiogram, also called ECG or EKG, is a tool used to
measure the electrical activity of the heart (Stern et al., 2001).
Heart rate variability (HRV) is the physiological phenomenon of
variation in the time interval between heartbeats and it reflects
the activation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic parts of
the autonomic nervous system. Several studies reported that
changes in the hearth rate (HR) might be correlated with changes

in the emotional state of a subject (arousal and valence) (HaBrookshire and Bhaduri, 2014; Valenza et al., 2014; BaraybarFernández et al., 2017).
ECG is a very simple, portable, non-invasive, widely used and
accessible tool that has a good temporal resolution. To use ECG,
researchers need only the device, a monitor and a computer to
synchronize the ECG signal (electrophysiological response) with
the stimulus. ECG has quite low costs (around tens of thousands
euros). The average time needed to perform an experiment using
ECG is about 15 min, because subject preparation is very fast.
It does require specialized personnel to acquire and analyse the
signal. However, ECG has limited applications because it should
be used in combination with other consumer neuroscience tools.

attention) originate in the brain and identify the brain areas
involved in the explication of cognitive functions underlying
marketing-relevant behavior. This section focusses on how
consumer neuroscience tools are used to study consumer
behavior. On the basis of the literature survey we identify the
following marketing-related topics where these tools are used:
advertising, branding, product experience, online experience,
product development and product pricing.

5.1. Advertising
We find that almost 45% of the studies (61 studies) investigate the
impact of advertising on consumer behavior (e.g., preferences,
satisfaction), emotions (e.g., positive, negative), and cognitive
processes (e.g., attention, memory, engagement). Consumer
neuroscience research analyses how consumers experience,
process and assess advertisements (Astolfi et al., 2008; Ohme
et al., 2010; Treleaven-Hassard et al., 2010; Morillo et al., 2015;
Soria Morillo et al., 2016; Cha et al., 2019; Golnar-Nik et al., 2019;
Kaklauskas et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2019; Mahamad et al., 2019;
Shaari et al., 2019). Studies focus on all types of advertising, i.e.,
brochure, billboard advertising, endorsements by spokespersons,
movie trailers, television advertisement, social advertisement,
Youtube videos and websites (Ohme and Matukin, 2012;
Vecchiato et al., 2012a,b; Randolph and Pierquet, 2015; Hamelin
et al., 2017; Jin et al., 2017; Missaglia et al., 2017; Kong et al.,
2019).
Depending on the tool used, we can get information on how
consumers process advertising stimuli. For instance, EEG can be
used to evaluate the effectiveness of advertising by measuring the
brain activity within milliseconds (Vecchiato et al., 2011; Kong
et al., 2013; Pileliene and Grigaliunaite, 2017b). In particular, EEG
oscillations, measured through the changes in spectral power of
EEG for some certain frequency bands, and in specific brain
regions, while investigating in the frequency domain, or, while
investigating in the time domain by looking at the derivation of
particular event-related potential (ERPs), can indicate a higher or
lower level of attention/memory/engagement of participants for a
different type of advertisements (e.g., movie trailers, anti-bingedrinking campaigns, Boksem and Smidts, 2015; Gountas et al.,
2019, see Table 3).
Another important tool used to investigate consumers’
responses to advertisement is eye tracking. ET allows researchers
to determine consumers’ visual attention though heat maps, scan
path and eye fixations (see Table 4). Measuring where and for
how long a person is looking at a specific advertisement could
provide important information on the level of attractiveness
(e.g., high number of fixations vs. low number of fixations)
and visibility (e.g., right size of product in the advertisement)
of an advertisement (e.g., Youtube video, product image)
(Venkatraman et al., 2015; Zamani et al., 2016).
fMRI is used to test advertisement effectiveness for product
images. In particular, fMRI can be used to investigate the
hemodynamics response (brain activations) in brain regions
responsible of these phenomena (Morris et al., 2009; Kühn et al.,
2016; Shen and Morris, 2016; Jung et al., 2018; Casado-Aranda
et al., 2019). As it has a low temporal resolution, fMRI might not
always be suitable for measuring brain activity during the view

4.8. Galvanic Skin Response
Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) is a physiological tool that
measures the electrical conductance of the skin through one
or two sensor(s), usually attached to some part of the hand or
foot (Nourbakhsh et al., 2012). The physiological basis of the
galvanic skin response is a change in autonomic tone (skin and
subcutaneous tissue) in accordance with the emotional state of
the subject. It is used to measure skin resistance, conductance,
and stress level in the body.
GSR is also considered a sensitive tool for measuring changes
in subject’s arousal and valence (Ravaja, 2004; Ayata et al., 2016).
Skin conductivity (SC) can reveal an activation in the autonomic
nervous system (ANS) (Nourbakhsh et al., 2012). Because an
increase in the activation of the ANS is an indicator of arousal
and valence, SC can be used as a measure of arousal and valence
(Vecchiato et al., 2014; Ayata et al., 2016).
GSR equipment is easy to set up and transport, making it ideal
for work in the field, for example, for assessing levels of emotional
arousal during in-store shopping experiences. However, GSR
has a low temporal resolution. In fact, different skin types
can create variability in responses across subjects, thus making
results difficult to aggregate. In addition, GSR is very sensitive
to artifacts. In fact, test subjects can freely move their hands
and body which may result in artifacts or false readings in the
GSR. During data analysis, artifacts can be detected and removed
by applying post-processing tools. The major limitation of GSR
is that it can only measure changes in subject’s arousal and
valence but it cannot determine the direction or the valence of an
emotional reaction. GSR requires at least a computer to correlate
the stimulus with GSR software to have reliable results.
The average cost of a GSR amplifier is in the order of a few
thousand euros. A GSR experiment requires one technician to
acquire GSR data and a technical expert for data analysis. The
average time needed to perform a GSR experiment is about 15
min because subject preparation is very fast. Finally, GSR is
characterized by a high level of integration with other consumer
neuroscience tools as it is portable and very easy to use (Ozkul
et al., 2019).

research on how cognitive processes (e.g., perception, memory,

help to study those behavioral measurements (e.g., preference,
satisfaction) and cognitive processes (e.g., attention, engagement
and memory) that are useful to investigate when determining
how an advertisement can catch consumers’ attention, or
is encoded in their memory. Many studies focus on postdesign application. However, consumer neuroscience tools can
also be very useful in pre-testing an advertisement—selecting
spokespersons (e.g., female), the right color temperature and type
of music to use in advertisement campaigns, for example (Wang
et al., 2016; Pileliene and Grigaliunaite, 2017a; Avinash et al.,
2018; Daugherty et al., 2018).
Another important aspect to consider in advertising is
selecting a company’s target audience; the group of customers or
potential customers to whom a company addresses its product or
service. Finding the right target audience is crucial to improve a
campaign’s efficiency. Consumer neuroscience tools can be used
to test the impact of advertisements on different target audiences
(e.g., male, female, young, adult, user, no user). For instance,

Overall, we find that there are three different areas that could
benefit from the application of consumer neuroscience tools in
advertising. In particular, we can use these tools to test:
• Advertising effectiveness
• Target audience
• Salient features.
Advertising effectiveness measures how well a company’s
advertising (or advertising campaign) reaches and generates
interest among customers or potential customers. Advertising
effectiveness is usually measured in relations to sales (Wells,
2014). However, consumer neuroscience research can provide
researchers and companies with measurements that give a better
understanding of how consumers respond to an advertisement
(e.g., positive or negative). It helps to study how customers
acquire and process advertisement information and how
behavioral measurements can be linked to cognitive and neuronal
processes. In particular, consumer neuroscience tools can

Picking Your Brains

Pravettoni, 2012; Reimann et al., 2012a,b; Pop et al., 2013; AlKwifi, 2016; Guo et al., 2018). Bosshard et al. (2016) used EEG
to test whether or not liked and disliked brands are further
associated with different motivational aspects. The findings of
this study suggest that liked brands elicited significantly more
positive going waveforms (late positive potentials) than disliked
brands over right parietal cortical areas. This result might infer
that liking a brand influences consumers’ electrical brain activity.
In addition, consumer neuroscience tools can help to investigate
how different brands are encoded, consolidated, and retrieved
from the consumer’s memory (McClure et al., 2004; Wang
et al., 2012; Kačániová and Vargová, 2017; Levrini et al., 2019;
Sung et al., 2019). For instance, remembered value refers to
how different brand associations are encoded, consolidated, and
retrieved from the consumer’s memory (Plassmann et al., 2012).
Using consumer neuroscience tools can help companies create
and design strong brands that are easy to remember and have a
strong emotional appeal.
Brand loyalty can be defined as the positive attitude toward
a brand (Ferrell and Hartline, 2012). Customers that are
loyal to a brand have a consistent preference for that brand,
despite other situational and marketing factors that have the
potential to induce switching behavior (Oliver, 1999). Consumer
neuroscience tools can help researchers to study the neuronal
and cognitive processes underlying brand loyalty (McClure et al.,
2004; Schaefer and Rotte, 2007; Lin et al., 2010; Plassmann
et al., 2012). For instance, Plassmann et al. (2007) investigated
the differences in neural activation between loyal and disloyal
customers of a store during purchasing decisions. Based on
psychological theories, the authors assumed that for loyal
customers the exposure to the store brand would modulate their
decision via an emotion-based path. The authors found that
customers who are loyal to a brand show more activation in
the striatum compared to customers who are less loyal, even if
they are buying identical clothes. The finding of this study also
suggests that loyal customers usually establish an emotional bond
with the physical brand stores, which might be the underlying
psychological driver of their repurchases.

Añaños (2015) used ET to measure differences in the level of
attention in elderly adults, compared with young people during
TV commercials. The results show that elderly people show a
lower level of attention for integrated content compared to young
people (Añaños, 2015). This finding suggests that advertising
formats (low, medium, high level of disruption) can have a
different impact on recognition between different target groups.
Finally, consumer neuroscience tools can be used to test an
advertisement’s salient features. An advertisement with good
salient features is capable of holding a consumer’s attention and
it has great memorizing value. Consumer neuroscience tools
measure how different versions of an advertisement or changes
in a TV commercial or video (e.g., length, speed, complexity
of the scene) can affect consumers’ preferences, attention or
recall for the advertisement (Zurawicki, 2010). A good example
of salient features testing is the study of Ohme et al. (2009).
The study measured the impact of two versions of a skin care
product advertisement using EEG, EMG, and GSR. Results show
that people were unable to identify any differences between the
two advertisements at a conscious level (when asked). However,
the neurophysiological measurements show that there was an
increase in alpha bands (detected using EEG) and arousal level
(detected using GSR) during the extra scene (model’s gesture)
in one version. EMG also revealed a significant difference in the
facial muscle activity while watching the alternative scenes of the
ad, specifically the additional scene provoked a higher level of
corrugation muscle activity. This finding suggests that consumer
neuroscience tools can add useful and important information to
study an advertisement’s salient features.

5.2. Branding
In today’s economy, consumers buy emotional experiences rather
than products and services (Hultén, 2011). The emotional linkage
and experience associated with a brand is extremely important in
building strong brands. Consumers’ expectations on how much
enjoyment they will derive from consuming a certain brand
does not depend on the real value of the brand. Consumer
expectations derived from consuming a brand are a mix of
emotional and cognitive factors, and these expectations are
usually formed on an unconscious level (Plassmann et al., 2012).
Thus, consumers often find it difficult to describe why they
enjoy a specific brand and/or why they are able to remember
a brand. Consumer neuroscience tools can help companies to
study emotional and neuronal processes while consumers choose,
experience and remember brand’s name or logos.
We identify two ways in which consumer neuroscience
can contribute to a better understanding of the psychology
of branding.

5.3. Online Experience and Website
Optimization
Living in the digital era offers new opportunities for both
consumers and companies. Consumers usually have a very wide
offer of products and services worldwide, which is accessible
24/7. Similarly, companies have easier access to customers’
information (e.g., location, age). Companies can also now reach
their customers more easily by automating customer services
(e.g., chatbot) and creating personalized messages for customers
(e.g., personalized emails). Thus, the use of digital channels in
business contributes to creating a very dynamic and competitive
environment. Understanding the psychology behind online
consumer behavior is key to compete in today’s markets.
Consumer neuroscience tools can improve the online
customer experience by testing the effectiveness of digital
marketing campaigns for:

• Brand choice
• Brand loyalty.
People often choose products based on their perceived value,
thus what the brand represents rather than the brand’s actual
value (Airey, 2009). Consumer neuroscience tools can be used to
investigate the emotional component underling brand evaluation
and choice, for example, differences between two similar brands
(e.g., Pepsi vs. Coke) (Ma et al., 2007, 2008; Lucchiari and

be used to assess how consumers experience price and the effect
of price based on their brain activity (e.g., positive, negative). For
instance, consumer neuroscience tools can be used to study the
difference in brain activity when consumers are exposed to low,
optimal, and upper price-thresholds (Linzmajer et al., 2011).
Premium pricing, also known as prestige pricing, is used to
influence consumers’ expectations of the product and ultimately
shape product experience (Almenberg and Dreber, 2011).
Premium price is the marketing practice of selling a product
for a higher price than competitors. Consumers usually associate
the high price with higher quality. Thus, premium price creates
an illusion of higher quality. Many marketing studies examine
how knowledge about the price of a good affects how the
good is experienced (Steenkamp et al., 2010; Almenberg and
Dreber, 2011; Sellers Rubio et al., 2016). Consumer neuroscience
studies also investigate how people enjoy consuming identical
products (e.g., wines, underwear) more when they have a higher
price. For instance, Plassmann et al. (2008) used fMRI to
examine how tasting the same wine with different price (low
and high) can effect consumers’ preferences and brain activity.
Their findings suggest that drinking wine with a higher price
increase consumers’ consumption enjoyment. In fact, the study
found an increase in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC)
due to changes in the price of a wine. mOFC is correlated
with behavioral pleasantness for odors, tastes and music. The
results suggest that increased activity in the mOFC leads to a
change in the actual experienced pleasantness derived from its
consumption (Plassmann et al., 2008).
Finally, consumer neuroscience tools can be used to assess the
effect of promotion on buying behavior for coupons, promoted
and non-promoted products, and unstructured or structured
sales techniques (Jones et al., 2012; Muñoz-Leiva et al., 2019).
Using EEG, Jones et al. (2012) measured consumers’ brain activity
during buying decisions for promoted (e.g., 15%) and nonpromoted products. The author investigated how consumers
(both male and female) with different characteristics (high and
low math anxiety) respond to different buy/no buy decisions
for promoted and non-promoted products. Using ERPs, Jones
et al. (2012) tested if high math anxiety leads to a riskreduction buying mentality (buy/no-buy decisions) compared
to low math anxiety and if this difference was influenced by
gender. The results showed a difference in the brain activity
of High MA consumers (process price information relatively
less fluently) compared to Low MA consumers (process price
information more fluently) during buying decisions (e.g., larger
LPC was detected for Low MA females under no promotions
for non-buys compared to High MA females). This may be
due to the adoption of a decision style which seeks to reject
offer prices whereas High MA females may assess prices via
attempting to confirm them (Jones et al., 2012). In addition,
larger FN400 amplitudes associated with enhanced conceptual
processing) were linked to purchases under promotions among
High MA females and Low MA males (Jones et al., 2012).
The reverse effect occurred for High MA females under
no promotions (larger FN400 were4 found for non-buys
than buys) (Jones et al., 2012). Overall, the results suggest
that math anxiety, promotion format, and gender influence

• Website and app optimization.
The increasing use of the Internet affects how people gather
information. Nowadays, consumers can receive information on
product and services more easily and faster compared to 20 years
ago. In particular, online reviews, and eWOM (e.g., blogs) have
become a significant and common way to acquire information
about a company or a brand. Since online reviews and eWOM
can influence other customers or potential customers, companies
try to adopt strategies that can affect customers’ rating behavior
(Wang et al., 2018). Consumer neuroscience tools can be used
to assess the effectiveness of online strategies by analyzing
the emotional responses of consumers to online ratings and
reviews (Wang et al., 2018; Hernández-Fernández et al., 2019).
Measuring physiological and emotional responses associated to
different strategies (e.g., a discount coupon for a five-star rating)
may help to determine (1) how consumers perceive digital
marketing strategies (e.g., aggressive, invasive) and (2) determine
the emotional responses (positive, negative, surprise) to specific
reviews or discussion topics (e.g., environment, service).
Website and App optimization is another important aspect
of digital marketing strategies. Designing a good website or
App is critical to improve the quality of the user experience
(e.g., customization, online appointments, orders). An effective
website or App should take into account different factors
such as visual design and layout, usability, speed, content and
search. Consumer neuroscience can be useful to test consumers’
emotional responses to these factors (e.g., layout) and optimize
websites and Apps (Chai et al., 2014; Jin et al., 2017; Yadava
et al., 2017; Casado-Aranda et al., 2019). For instance, ET is
an effective tool to test how users interact with a website (e.g.,
Mercedes-Benz) (Etzold et al., 2019). In fact, ET heat maps
help identify shortcomings and hidden information (e.g., search
button) when customers navigate on a website.

5.4. Pricing
One important element of the marketing mix that may influence
consumer behavior is price. In the literature, only a few
studies investigate how price influences cognitive and neural
mechanisms. In particular, consumer neuroscience tools are used
to study the effect of price on experienced quality by consumers
(e.g., positive or negative expectations).
Consumer Neuroscience tools can be used to study three
important aspects in pricing strategy:
• Price fairness
• Premium pricing
• Promotion.
Price fairness refers to the process that leads consumers to define
if a price is reasonable or not, compared to one or more prices
(Xia et al., 2010). Usually, people want to pay less for products,
however, prices below a lower price-threshold may signal poor
product quality. Instead, prices above an upper threshold may
be considered as too high (price deception) (Fu et al., 2019).
The biggest challenge for companies is to set a “fair” price for
customers without altering their perception of quality (Cakir
et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018). Consumer neuroscience tools can

can also be used to measure how consumer expectations of
product quality are assessed based on product characteristics
and individual preferences (Muñoz-Leiva and Gómez-Carmona,
2019).

both consumer behavior and brain activity during consumer
buying decisions.

5.5. Product Development
Consumer neuroscience research can help companies to
design and develop desirable products by studying consumers’
preferences for a product’s internal and external characteristics.
External characteristics (or aesthetics) refer to the visual, tactile
and formal attributes of a product, such as color, shape and
materials (Rindova and Petkova, 2007). The literature suggests
that external characteristics can strongly influence consumers’
perception and preference of products. For instance, colors
can influence moods and feelings (positively or negatively),
and consequently a consumer’s attitude toward certain products
(Singh, 2006). Internal characteristics refer to those specific
and physical properties (e.g., ingredients, durability, taste) that
cannot be changed without altering the nature of the product
itself (Olson, 1976). However, consumers’ perceptions of internal
characteristics may be modulated by external characteristics.
Consumer Neuroscience tools can be used to investigate how
product characteristics influence consumers’ sensory perceptions
and preferences (Milosavljevic et al., 2012; Touchette and Lee,
2017; Muñoz-Leiva and Gómez-Carmona, 2019; Ploom et al.,
2019). In particular, studies investigated how design, visual and
tactile attributes influence consumers’ brain activity. Consumer
neuroscience tools also allow researchers to study how consumers
assess product quality. Research on product characteristics
mostly focussed on post-design applications. In the future,
consumer neuroscience tools might be used to help companies
developing new products in terms of:

5.6. Product Experience
Product experience occurs through interaction between the
consumer and the product, physically or visually (Brakus et al.,
2009). During the product experience, consumers are typically
asked to reflect on the physical and emotional reactions induced
by product experience. Another important contribution of
consumer neuroscience research is the study of sensation or
perception during product experience. Sensation is the activation
of sensory receptor cells at the level of the stimulus (e.g., taste
receptors). Perception is the processing of sensory stimuli into
a meaningful pattern (BCcampus, 2018). The process of sensory
perception begins when a product (e.g., perfume) stimulates our
sense organs (e.g., tongue, nose, skin). Consumer neuroscience
studies how people process, recognize and characterize sensory
information through the five major senses, sight, smell, taste,
touch and hearing. Several consumer neuroscience studies
investigated how appearance, odor, flavor, taste and texture
attributes can influence sensory perception and preferences
of different products (e.g., food, lipsticks, music, water, wine)
(Nittono and Watari, 2017; Tanida et al., 2017; Avinash et al.,
2018; Hsu and Chen, 2019; Meyerding and Mehlhose, 2020).
For instance, (Alvino et al., 2019) used EEG to measure brain
activity and individual preferences for red wines during two
tasting sessions (blind and normal). The findings of that study
suggest that EEG is a useful tool to study brain activity
during product experience due to its high temporal resolution
and superior manoeuvrability compared to other consumer
neuroscience tools.
Overall, consumer neuroscience tools can be used to study
different types of product experience:

• Product characteristics
• Product quality.
Consumer neuroscience research also focusses on the impact
of external characteristics (e.g., packaging, color) on consumers’
physiological and neuronal responses. For instance, (Reimann
et al., 2010) used fMRI to examine the effect of different
packaging designs (decorated vs. standard) on consumers’
engagement and affective processing (reward). The results of that
study show that intense emotional responses, such as the view of
decorated packages, elicited strong affective processing. In fact,
brain areas related to the reward system (nucleus accumbens
and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex) were active during the
view of decorated packaging. These results suggest that decorated
packaging triggers reward mechanisms and choice compared to
plain and simple packaging design.
Understanding how consumers assess product quality is
important to study as it may influence consumer buying
behaviors. Product characteristics can affect how consumers
perceive product quality (Olson, 1976). The evaluation of product
characteristics is a cognitive process that modulates attention,
thus, consumer neuroscience tools can be used to analyse
neural processes that occur during product evaluation. For
instance, EEG can be used to test attentional mechanisms during
consumers’ evaluation of product quality for different products
(e.g., shoes, music, wine) due to its high temporal resolution
(Yilmaz et al., 2014; Gkaintatzis et al., 2019). Instead, fMRI

• In-store experience
• Destination marketing and Tourism.
In-store experiences occur when a consumer interacts with a
store’s physical environment (Kerin et al., 1992; Brakus et al.,
2009). In-store experience does not necessarily lead to sales
but it can encourage visitors to the store. Thus, improving instore experience can help companies to be more competitive
by offering experiences that are not available online. The effect
of in-store experience can be tested by measuring how in-store
variables, such as color, light, or music on consumers influence
consumer buying behavior (Berčík et al., 2016; Ozkul et al.,
2019). For instance, consumer neuroscience tools can be used
to study the effect of light intensity and color temperature on
purchasing decisions for fresh food (e.g., meat, dairy products)
and beverages (wine, alcohol) (Horská and Berčík, 2014). Those
studies used portable devices, like wearable EEG and ET, to
measure consumers’ physiological responses.
Finally, consumer neuroscience tools are used to test tourism
satisfaction and measure physiological reactions during tourism
experiences (Ma et al., 2014; Muñoz-Leiva et al., 2019).
Consumers usually choose a travel destination not only based on

16

Alvino et al.

Picking Your Brains

the style of vacation they want but also considering the time, price
and accommodation. However, emotional reactions to tourist
destinations play a big role in their choices. Thus, travel agencies
usually try to create campaigns that emotionally resonate with
consumers, to create a deep emotional bond between the
destination (e.g., city, hotel) and the customer. Consumer
neuroscience tools can be used to assess which elements of the
destination marketing campaign can trigger positive or negative
emotions. For example, (Bastiaansen et al., 2018) using EEG
to evaluate the effectiveness of tourist destination marketing
content in movies on Bruges and Kyoto. We find that the
number of studies on tourism experience is limited. However,
consumer neuroscience tools might be used in the future to assess
how consumers experience tourism and hospitality services, for
instance, room and spa services.

design studies and media/ad/website testing. It enables the easy
set-up of participant groups, randomizations, and block designs
as needed, and the data can be viewed both in real time and
replay. iMotions software platform has been recently used in
consumer neuroscience research. This was used to (1) measure
willingness to pay, (2) the effect of music in advertisements,
and (3) to evaluate the efficiency of online appointment booking
platforms (Cuesta et al., 2018; Kulke et al., 2018; Ramsøy et al.,
2018; Etzold et al., 2019). The main advantages of iMotion are
that it can be adjusted to the needs of customers. There are
different versions and the number of integrated tools can be
changed. Another advantage of iMotions is that it can be used
both in real-life or lab settings.
The second method is GRAIL (Gait Real-time Analysis
Interactive Lab) system. The GRAIL system (Motek Medical
BV, the Netherlands) is a new medical device that uses an
instrumented dual-belt treadmill placed in a speed-matched and
synchronized virtual reality (VR) environment and a motioncapture system (VICON system, Vicon Motion Systems Ltd
UK). GRAIL allows users to perform clinical gait analysis, which
consists of the computation of various gait parameters such
as posture, muscle activation and ground reaction forces in
real-time (Van den Bogert et al., 2013). The core element of
the system is represented by the D-Flow software platform,
which integrates both motion capture technology and a motion
platform, allowing the subject to interact in real time with
the system and receive feedback from it. D-Flow controls all
the hardware connected to the system and also includes a 3D
game engine to provide interactive VR environments to mimic
real-life situations that engage subjects. In fact, it makes the
subject part of a real-time feedback loop, in which multi-sensory
input devices measure behavioral and physiological responses,
while output devices return motor sensory, visual and auditory
feedback to the subject. A semi-cylindrical 180◦ projection
screen immerses the subject in a virtual reality environment
that mimics real-life situations (i.e., a market). In addition
to this, thanks to D-Flow software, it is possible to integrate
other tools such as electromyography, electroencephalography,
electrocardiography, galvanic skin response, eye tracking and
head motions detection technology.
To our knowledge, GRAIL has been never used in consumer
neuroscience research. However, it could represent a useful and
complete tool for consumer neuroscience research for several
reasons. D-Flow software has an intuitive interface that allows
operators to easily control hardware, tailor applications or define
their own applications. In addition, the D-Flow interface does not
require programming skills, therefore, less training is required
compared to other consumer neuroscience tools for researchers
and practitioners who do not have technical skills (e.g., coding,
programming). Using GRAIL would facilitate companies and
universities to carry out consumer neuroscience experiments by
reducing the time and expenses of training (e.g., fewer training
sessions, in-house training). Finally, the use of fully customisable
VR environments could increase the efficacy and the accuracy
of consumer neuroscience research. Consumer neuroscience
experiments too often simplify the complexity of the decision
process because experiments are carried out in a laboratory

6. NEW METHODS IN CONSUMER
NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH
We find two ready-to-use platforms that allow the use of several
consumer neuroscience tools (e.g., ET, GSR) simultaneously.
Several studies have already used a combination of different
consumer neuroscience tools (e.g., ET, ECG). Using ready-touse platforms may facilitate researchers to measure behavioral,
physiological, and neurophysiological responses in a single
experiment. Measuring brain activity and physiological responses
simultaneously could help researchers to link cognitive and
emotional aspects with neuronal processes during product
experience (e.g. beverage tasting), online and offline purchase
decisions, product quality assessment and brand exposure.
Furthermore, ready-to-use platforms might also ensure a more
reliable timing of signal acquisition, and direct synchronization
between stimuli and responses (iMotions, 2012). Thus, these
advantages could contribute to creating more realistic theories
and models in consumer neuroscience research. In this section,
we compare two platforms and identify potential benefits and
limitations of these methods.
The first method is iMotions Platform (iMotions platform
iMotions A/S, Kobenhavn V, Denmark). iMotions is an
integrated analysis platform that measures consumer behavior
and monitors different aspects of human responses to marketing
stimuli using different sensors. iMotions platform provides
full integration and synchronization support for more than
50 biosensors. iMotions can integrate up to six consumer
neuroscience tools such as ET, facial expression analysis
software, GSR, ECG and EEG headsets. iMotions also uses
Application Programming Interface (API) and Lab Streaming
Layerand for additional sensor integration. Most importantly,
iMotions has a built-in survey tool that triangulates respondents’
behavioral data (e.g., answers to survey) with neurophysiological
responses, providing higher validity to consumer neuroscience
experiments. iMotions allows users to perform studies in
different environments such as laboratory, shops. This platform
can be used to study consumer behavior and neurophysiological
responses by exposing subjects to images, videos, games, apps, or
software and allowing them to test real-like objects in product

setting. In addition, it is not always possible to use iMotion in
real-world situations due to logistic and economic reasons. In
contrast, the GRAIL system can provide a consistent level of
user experience and interactivity because of its ability to provide
highly customisable VR environments.
GRAIL allows researchers to have a permanent lab in a small
space mimicking real-life scenarios. Finally, the safe environment
of GRAIL can help reduce motion artifacts that can be generated
by moving in a wider environment. Table 5 summarizes the
number of neuroscience tools that can be integrated and the
advantages and disadvantages of both platforms.

The application of physiological theories and neuroscience tools
to marketing has rapidly grown in the last two decades. While
the interest in consumer neuroscience is increasing, researchers
in the field are facing new and complex challenges. Hence, it is
important to have a clear overview of current (and potential)
tools used in consumer neuroscience research. Thus, researchers
(especially newcomers) might find it useful to identify or choose
which tools are suitable to be applied in specific aspects of
consumer neuroscience research. In this article, we examine
present neuromarketing and consumer neuroscience literature
with an aim to provide an overview of the use and characteristics
of neuroscience tools used for studying consumer behavior.
We follow a literature review methodology as proposed by
Webster and Watson (2002) in order to select relevant literature
for our study. We evaluate a total of 219 publications to
record details about the use and characteristics of consumer
neuroscience tools. In section 2, we identify a wide range of
neuroscience tools described as consumer neuroscience research
(i.e., 15 tools). However, the findings of our study highlighted
that the number of tools used in consumer neuroscience research
might be lower. We identify seven tools that have been practically
used in the field, namely EEG, fMRI, fNIRS, ECG, ET, GSR,
and facial expression recognition software. We do not find any
empirical evidence for the use of the other tools. We propose a
criterion to classify the practically used consumer neuroscience
tools as shown in Figure 4. We believe that classifications
including self-reports and questionnaires, like Ramsøy (2015)
give a more accurate and realistic idea of the variety of tools
that can be used in consumer neuroscience research. In our
classification, we divided consumer neuroscience tools into three
categories, namely (1) behavioral (self-reports, observations,
survey), (2) physiological (ECG, ET, ECG, fERS), and (3)
neurophysiological (electrical: EEG and metabolic: fMRI, fNRIS).
We also evaluate the popularity of the consumer neuroscience
tools based on how often they were used by researchers.
Studies have argued that fMRI is the most used neuroimaging
tool in consumer neuroscience research (Smidts et al., 2014;
Ramsøy, 2015; Harris et al., 2018). However, we find that
EEG, both traditional and wearable, is the most popular tool,
followed by Eye Tracking. These results are also in line with a
survey conducted by the Neuromarketing Science and Business
Association (NMSBA) on consumer neuroscience vendors in

Facial EMG

setting (Lee et al., 2018; Alvino et al., 2019). Participants are
subjected to a standardized procedure and there is no interaction
with the external environment. The synchronized virtual reality
(VR) environment of GRAIL immerses participants in a virtual
scenario that reproduces real-life situations, while researchers
can monitor participants’ cognitive and behavioral phenomena
using different types of tools. VR has been demonstrated to
contribute to enhancing consumer experience and customer
interactivity by directly impacting the users’ sensory elements
(Vrechopoulos et al., 2009; Bigne et al., 2016; Vickers, 2017).
GRAIL allows the recreation of real-life purchase situations,
for instance, walking in a supermarket, mall or hotel while
participants are still in a controlled environment. Additionally,
GRAIL enables researchers to study brain activity and
physiological responses while participants perform complex
tasks (e.g., look at advertisement while walking) or make complex
choices (e.g., choosing between several products on a shelf). VR
offers the opportunity to develop completely new situations,
impossible to create in the real world, and the development
of contexts that will never be experienced by most people in
real life.
Despite all the described advantages, it should be noted that
the GRAIL system also has disadvantages. The first one is the
costs of the system, which is around e400,000. These costs do not
include other hardware to be integrated (e.g., EEG, EMG). The
complete system needs a total space of at least 25 m2 . The average
time required for a experiment is about 45 min, including subject
preparation, which is the phase that requires the most time,
especially if the experimenter needs to compute gait parameters.
Compared to GRAIL, iMotions is less expensive. In fact,
GRAIL consists of expensive integrated devices (treadmill,
motion capture system, software, computers), while iMotions
includes only the software platform and does not integrate by
default any hardware. In addition, iMotions is highly portable,
highly flexible and it allows also facial expression recognition.
If used in a real world environment, iMotions could provide a
higher user experience and interactivity than GRAIL. However,
iMotions does not allow the measurement of gait parameters
and it provides a limited user experience when used in a lab

Consumer neuroscience research focusses on important aspects
of advertisement strategies, such as advertisement effectiveness
(pre- and post-testing) and target audience selection (e.g., young,
adults, male, female). Based on our findings, a small number of
studies used neuroscience tools to study product experience. It
suggests that research in this specific marketing issues is still in an
initial phase. However, there are new and promising applications
of consumer neuroscience tools to marketing research. Our
findings suggest that consumer neuroscience tools contribute to
both theoretical and practical aspects of marketing research.
In recent years, we have seen an increase in the number
of studies that integrate two or more consumer neuroscience
tools. We believe that ready-to-use platforms might help
researchers build more realistic theories and models in consumer
neuroscience research. In fact, platforms can contribute to
(1) reducing time and cost to set up experiments, (2) more
reliable data processing, (3) setting up large scale studies, and
(4) collecting simultaneous information on physiological and
neurophysiological processes. In this study, we identified two
ready-to-use platforms that integrate some of the consumer
neuroscience tools discussed in this research, namely iMotions
and GRAIL. The first platform, iMotions, has been previously
used in consumer neuroscience studies to investigate willingness
to pay and consumer satisfaction for different products (e.g.,
bags, clothes, FMCG, shoes) and services (e.g., booking
platform). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
to consider GRAIL (the second platform identified by us) for use
in consumer neuroscience research.
Our findings show that both platforms can integrate six
tools and measure both physiological and neurophysiological
processes. In particular, iMotion can integrate wearable EEG,
facial electromyography, ET, ECG, GSR, head motion. GRAIL
integrates wearable EEG, facial electromyography, ET, ECG, GSR
and head motion. GRAIL can also offer gait analysis. Compared
to GRAIL, iMotion is relatively low cost and portable. Thus,
iMotion can also be used outside lab settings. However, GRAIL
incorporates synchronized virtual reality (VR) that can easily
reproduce real-life situations. GRAIL’s customizable VR allows
for the recreation of different environment in one experiment.
This platform can help the improvement of consumer experience
and customer interactivity in consumer neuroscience studies.
We believe that this study provides a comprehensive
overview of the consumer neuroscience tools that have
been practically used by researchers. We hope that this
work will help researchers and practitioners in choosing
the correct tool for their experiment by providing them
with necessary information to evaluate the pros and cons
of available tools. We also emphasize the potential of
upcoming ready-to-use platforms that can help make
consumer neuroscience experiments reliable, quick, and
low cost.

2018 (Cherubino et al., 2019). This suggests that there has been
a change in the use and applications of consumer neuroscience
tools in the last 5 years. It is possible that researchers no longer
use fMRI because there are other tools that are available for
consumer neuroscience research. It might also be possible that
researchers are opting for more portable, less invasive and lowcost tools. Although fMRI is not considered an invasive tool,
subjects might suffer inconvenience due to being in a small
space, an inability to move and excessive noise during the
scan. Also, fMRI applications in consumer neuroscience are also
limited due to disturbing environmental factors (e.g., lightning
conditions, auditory noise). Wearable EEG, fNIRS, ET, GSR,
ECG, and Facial Expression recognition software allow higher
flexibility to the subjects (e.g., sit, walk). Thus, wearable tools
allow the designing of field experiments and not only laboratory
experiments. Thus, these tools can help recreate a natural setting
for consumer neuroscience experiments compared to fMRI.
Additionally, some studies have implied that all neuroscience
tools can be used in consumer neuroscience research. We argue
that some neuroscience tools are not suitable for marketing
research due to moral and ethical implications. In particular,
we suggest that tools such as PET, TMS, and SPET should
not be used in consumer neuroscience research. In fact, PET,
TMS, and SPET may be too invasive or harmful to be used in
consumer neuroscience studies. These tools expose participants
to unnecessary risks, such as pain, fainting, seizures, and injection
of radiopharmaceuticals.
In section 4, we analyzed the advantages, disadvantages,
average costs and time preparation for each of these tools. In
total, we identified three neurophysiological tools (EEG, fMRI,
and fNIRS) and four physiological tools (ET, GSR, ECT, fERS).
Our findings suggest that neurophysiological tools are usually
more expensive, time consuming and technical knowledgebased (e.g., coding) compared to physiological tools. Similarly,
neurophysiological tools can only be used in lab settings, except
for the wearable EEG. In contrast, physiological tools are lowcost, easy to integrate with other tools and do not require
much technical-knowledge and preparation time. Furthermore,
wearable physiological tools can be used outside lab settings
such as supermarkets and hotels. Thus, they contribute to study
consumer behavior in real-life scenarios.
To understand how these tools improve marketing
research we also analyzed the cognitive processes, behavioral
measurements, marketing applications and types of product
for each consumer neuroscience tool (e.g., EEG, ET). Our
findings show that neurophysiological tools allow the study of
cognitive processes (e.g., attention, excitement) and behavioral
measurement for a wide range of marketing issues. In contrast,
physiological tools such as ECG, GSR, and fERS have limited
applications in marketing as they only measure a few cognitive
processes (arousal, attention, engagement, emotion, and
valence). We found that consumer neuroscience tools are
currently used to improve marketing strategies for advertising,
branding, product experience, online experience, product
development and pricing. In particular, we found that the most
important contribution consumer neuroscience tools can offer
to marketing is the study of consumer behavior in advertising.

fERS. EEG is the most commonly used tool in consumer
neuroscience research.
• Physiological tools are usually cheaper and portable compared
to neurophysiological ones.
• Consumer neuroscience tools have applications in several
marketing domains such as advertising, branding,
online experience, pricing, product development and
product experience.
• Ready-to-use platforms (iMotions and GRAIL) measure
behavioral, physiological, and neurophysiological responses
simultaneously. GRAIL includes a personalized virtual
reality setting that enhances the consumer experience and
customer interactivity.

methodological shortcomings, the present study is not
completely bias-free. In this study, we consider publications
in the English language only; there is a possibility that
we have overlooked tools whose practical use has been
explained only in non-English publications. Also, we have
focussed on only a few aspects of the moral and ethical
implications of the use of consumer neuroscience tools.
For future work, we suggest researchers analyse the effect
of consumer neuroscience research on personal privacy
and ethical values and principles. We would like to invite
researchers to investigate the possible contributions of
neuroscience tools to others disciplines such as economics
and organizational behavior.
For a successful consumer neuroscience experiment, it is
also important for researchers to design the experiment well
(Fink et al., 2007; Murray and Antonakis, 2019). In this
review, our goal was to describe consumer neuroscience tools,
hence, we do not look at the experimental design aspect
of consumer neuroscience within the scope of this review.
We would like to investigate the success and failure of
experimental designs in consumer neuroscience research in
the future.
