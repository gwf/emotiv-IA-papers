amplitude between symmetric channels, and the presence of
low-frequency waves such as Delta, Theta, and Mu [4].
Previous research used motor imagery parameters to identify
the motor skills of paralyzed limbs [5]. Motor imagery is
thinking of a movement without involving the muscles so that
it is related to electrical disturbances in some post-stroke
patients. Motor imagery variable of EEG signal detected
stroke patients in rehabilitation period [6]. Other study used
motor imagery variable to identify stir movements simulation.
Motor movements that can be identified through EEG signals
reflect hand movement [10]. Identification patient motor
imagery supporting the evaluation of post-stroke
rehabilitation [11]. Most imagery motors use Mu wave in the
imagery motor classification [12].

Abstract— Stroke attacks often cause disability, so the need
for rehabilitation to restore patient's motor skills.
Electroencephalogram (EEG) is an instrument that can capture
electrical activity in the brain. Some post-stroke patients have
brain electrical dysfunction so that EEG signal can achieve such
as amplitude decrease, and wave differences from symmetric
channels. However, EEG signal analysis is not easy because it
has high complexity and small amplitude. However, information
from EEG signals is beneficial, including for stroke
identification. This study proposes the identification of EEG
signals from post-stroke patients using wavelet extraction and
Backpropagation Levernberg-Marquardt. EEG signals are
recorded, extracted imagery motor variables, and
synchronization of symmetric channels. The results of the study
provide that the accuracy for identifying post-stroke EEG
signals is 100% for training data and 79.69 % for new data.
Research also shows that the use of learning rates affects
accuracy. The smaller the learning rate provided accuracy is
better. However, it had consequences for computing time so that
the optimal learning rate is 0.0001.

Meanwhile, implementation of wavelet transforms for the
classification of emotions in post-stroke patients [7] and
identifying variables that affect post-stroke patients [4]. EEG
signals are also used to detect electrical abnormalities in the
brain, such as Epilepsy [8].

Keywords— post-stroke; EEG; motor imagery; wavelet;
backpropagation; Levenberg-Marquardt

One of the learning algorithms used to identify EEG
signals is Backpropagation Levenberg-Marquardt. In previous
studies, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was used for the
classification of hand motion imagery motors [13].
Backpropagation Levenberg-Marquardt method has identified
motor imagery of left and right-hand movement. It showed
that it worked faster than ordinary Backpropagation [14].

I. INTRODUCTION
A stroke occurs when part of the brain-damaged due to the
lack of blood supply. At present, stroke is the third most
common cause of death after heart disease and cancer [1].
Stroke is also the main factor causing severe disability. To
restore motor skills and improve quality of life, post-stroke
patients undergo the right rehabilitation program. Therefore,
monitoring and evaluation are required.

Backpropagation Levenberg-Marquardt also classified the
condition of open eyes and closed eyes through EEG signals
[15]. Meanwhile, other studies identified neuropsychological
emotions toward advertising videos [16].

In evaluating the rehabilitation of post-stroke patients, one
of the methods of observation carried out by neurologists is
the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS).
NIHSS, as an initial assessment tool in rehabilitation
monitoring [2]. However, unfortunately, this method tends to
be subjective. There is an instrument that can capture
electrical activity in the brain, such an Electroencephalogram
(EEG).

This study proposed a method to classifying post-stroke
patients of EEG signal data that has been extracted using
Wavelet first. The EEG signal variables used are imagery
motors and symmetrical channel wave differences.
Identification was performed using learning with the
Levenberg-Marquardt Backpropagation algorithm first.
II. RELATED WORKS

The device can obtain electrical abnormalities in the brain
that occur as post-stroke patients. EEG operations are quite
cheap, safe, and can be performed in real-time. However, EEG
analysis is not easy given the complexity of the signal and has
a small amplitude.

A. Motor Imagery
Motor imagery is a cognitive process where the subject
imagines moving his limbs without involving muscle gestures.
In a movement at least there are organs involved, the brain
commands to move and the muscles that execute. When there
are abnormalities such as stroke sufferers, then one of the
indicators of rehabilitation success is the function of moving
the hands or feet, which is characterized by motor imagery. In
other words, motor imagery requires a part of the brain that
functions to prepare movements and movements accompanied
by regulation of these movements. [17]. Several ways to
measure motor imagery, one way by using EEG signals µ

Previous research analyzed the relationship between EEG
signals for male patients with the NIHSS method [3]. The
study only looked at the comparison of EEG sub-band signals
with the NIHSS score. However, it has not done a detailed
pattern analysis.
Neurologist usually observes the rhythm or density of
waves, amplitude, changes in amplitude, differences in

(Mu) and β (Beta) to classify motor imagery using Wavelet
Time-Frequency Image [12].

The Backpropagation Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm
uses the Hessian (H) matrix approach on (6). Also, the
algorithm improves the computational time in the iteration of
the Backpropagation method.

B. Wavelet Extraction
EEG signals have frequency components called Delta
waves (<4Hz), Theta (4-7 Hz), Alpha and Mu (8-13Hz), Beta
(14-30 Hz) and Gamma (> 30 Hz) [17]. Motor imagery, as an
indication of the condition of post-stroke patients, is
associated with the presence of Mu waves, specifically in the
central area.

C. Backpropagation Levenberg-Marquardt
The Backpropagation Levenberg-Marquardt is an
algorithm that is the development of the Backpropagation
through revising the weight correction. Weight values start
with random, and then it is corrected in the reverse direction
based on the difference between the output of the feed-forward
process [21]and the actual output of each neuron [21].

III. RESEARCH METHOD
Classification of EEG signals from post-stroke patients
uses imagery motor components and synchronization of
symmetric channel pairs. Nevertheless, the elements of the
Theta and Delta waves are included.

The Levenberg Marquardt method uses optimize learning
algorithms considering that standard algorithms have a weak
convergence rate. This condition becomes many iterations to
give the smallest error [15].
Neurons of the input layer are equal to the number of
features, which are the result of extraction. The number of
output neurons is the number of classes. Meanwhile, the
number of neurons from the hidden layer can be calculated
using (5).

A. Wavelet Extraction
Data extraction is carried out for each segment so that the
wave components obtained are by the instructions given. The
waves taken in this study are Delta, Theta, and Mu, which are
segmented every two seconds to produce 256 data obtained
from 128Hz × 2 seconds. The signal decomposition process is
carried out up to five levels using Wavelet, which can be seen
in Fig 3.

A. Parameter Optimization
Dynamic weight correction is an improvement from the
Backpropagation Levernberg-Marquadts (BPLM) algorithm.
First tested the accuracy and computation of several learning
rate values. In this case, the experiment uses a variety of
learning rates 0.0100, 0.0010, and 0.0001. Correctness and
losses up to epoch 100 can be seen in Table I.

The experiment used BPLM algorithm with a learning rate
of 0.0100 of 100 epochs resulting in training data accuracy of
93.40% and validation data of 75%, shown in Fig. 5.
Fig. 3. Decomposition of multilevel Wavelet

Wavelet extraction is carried out in the Delta area (8x14
canals), Theta waves (8x14 canals), and Mu (12x2 canals).
Meanwhile, synchronizing of the symmetric channel value is
obtained comparing the waves of symmetric channel pair that
is 110 points for each second. If the EEG signal is recorded
every two seconds, then it gets 2 x 358 = 716 seconds. This
extraction is an input feature of artificial neural networks.

Meanwhile, losses or the difference in target output and
actual output shown in Fig. 6. The learning rate of 0.0100 for
training data provides losses of 0.0517 and variance data of
0.2002. With a training time of 2.7828 seconds per epoch.

B. Backpropagation Levenberg-Marquardt
Classification is accomplished by Artificial Neural
Networks with the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) architecture,
as shown in Fig. 4. MLP has three layers, i.e., the input layer,
hidden layer, and output layer. The input layer has 716
neurons following the features number. The output layer has
two neurons as two-class. Also, the hidden layer has 38
neurons from the computation (4).

Decreasing the learning rate to 0.0100 from 0.0100 can
improve the accuracy of 100% training data and decrease
computing time each epoch into 0.8908 of 2.7828. It seems
that the learning rate value of 0.0010 has given good results,
and the decrease in learning rate has less effect on increasing
accuracy. The value of accuracy and losses from the use of the
learning rate 0.0010 are shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8.

The comparison results of using the Backpropagation
Levernberg-Marquardt can increase accuracy almost twice
from the training data and about half of the validation data.
Therefore BPLM can improve the Backpropagation
algorithm. This accuracy increase occurs from all learning
rate uses, which are shown in Fig. 11 – Fig. 14.

Decreasing the learning rate to 0.0010 from 0.0100 can
improve the accuracy of 100% training data. However, the
decrease in the learning rate to 0.0001 turned out to only
increase the correctness of the validation data only 1%. The
accuracy of the use of the learning rate 0.0001 is shown in Fig.
9, and losses are shown in Fig. 10.

Proc. EECSI 2019 - Bandung, Indonesia, 18-20 Sept 2019

synchronization parameters in the learning rate 0.0001 have
an accuracy of 97% -99% of the training data and 69-81% of
the validation data. The highest accuracy of validation data is
on the O1-O2 channel with an accuracy of 81.25% in 100
epochs. However, the accuracy of the entire channel and the
results of symmetric synchronization are 69.27-81.25%.

79.69% of the validation data. After several experiments, the
same learning rate has different results because the initial
weight is random.
The Backpropagation Levernberg-Marquardt algorithm
can improve the weight update in the Backpropagation
algorithm so that it can improve accuracy and reduce losses
by almost 90% of training data and around 50% of the
validation data for all learning rate parameters.

Meanwhile, for big training data, the LevenbergMarquardt Backpropagation algorithm requires a very long
learning time, more than a day considering it cannot be done
in parallel for some data but must be done simultaneously
without batching. The experimental results also show that
although the learning rate of 0,0001 provides high accuracy,
the loss of the best and most stable learning is given at the
0.0100 learning rate, which is equal to 0.2002.

This study used motor imagery variables and the wave
difference of the symmetric channel pairs with 79.69%
accuracy. This result is higher than previous studies using the
features of Alpha - Beta - Mu - Amplitude - Asymmetric of
Alpha - Asymmetric of Beta - Asymmetric of Amplitude that
gave 74%. In meanwhile, using all features obtained an
accuracy of 70% [4]. However, other study involved
emotional variables of post-stroke patients, which used
Wavelet, KNN, and Probabilistic Neural Networks provided
82% of accuracy [7]]. This result is considering that emotions
reflect the overall stroke disorder. While motor imagery
variables and synchronization of symmetric channels only
include electrical abnormalities in the brain.
V. CONCLUSION
Motor imagery and synchronization of symmetric channel
pair information can be used to detect EEG signal
abnormalities from post-stroke patients. The EEG signal is
extracted first to get both of this information, which are
features for identification using the Levenberg-Marquardt
Backpropagation algorithm.
The results of the study also showed that the realization of
training data with a small learning rate of 0.0001 provided
convergent training and accuracy of training data 100% and
