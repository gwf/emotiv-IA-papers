Abstract. The recording of EEG signals often still contains many
contaminants electrical signals that originate from non-cerebral origin such
as ocular muscle activity called artefacts. The amplitude of artefacts can be
quite large relative to the size of amplitude of the cortical signals of
interest. In this paper, an application of wavelet denoising method for
artefacts removal of EEG signals is proposed. The experiment result shows
that contaminant artifact of EEG signals can significantly removed.

1 Introduction
Biomedical signal in various form is a source of information that comes from human body and useful
in medical interpretation. The Brain is an organ of the human body is composed of neuron that can
generate the electrical potential energy known as neuroelectric potentials [1].
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive measurement of brain electrical activity obtained by
placing electrodes on the scalp in areas of the brain [2]. EEG provides brain signal information based
on recording data result in non-invasive method to analyze the brain activity that is important for
medical (i.e. diagnosis, monitoring, and managing diseases or disorders of the nerves) and research
(i.e. neuroscience, cognitive science, cognitive psychology, neurolinguistics and psychophysiological
research) uses. The EEG signals is often contaminated by artefacts that often comes from muscle
activity, which may reduce its usefulness for clinical or research by disturbing interpretation of the
signal [2 - 5].
The main sources of artefacts are the EOG artefacts, ocular artefacts (eye movement and eye
blink), noise muscles (EMG), heart signal, and various kinds of noise which is mixed with brain
signals and often be the artefacts in EEG recordings [6-10]. Removal of artefacts is the real solution
for quantitative analysis in the EEG recordings. The researchers eliminate artefacts in the EEG signals
called the raw EEG data [11] to obtain a signal that is "clean EEG signal" that can be further
analyzed. Quantitative methods for the analysis of EEG has been developed by many researchers.
The method is widely used to treat and reduce the noise of the brain signals including bandpass
filters, autoregressive models [arjon], Finite Impulse Response ( FIR ). In this paper, a method of
using wavelet denoising with daubechies wavelet (db1) and 3rd decomposition level is proposed.
Wavelet is a mathematical model that fits in detecting and analyzing the events that occur in different
scales, providing information on the time and frequency domains [13]. The wavelet method has the

ability to transform a time domain signal into time and frequency that helps to better understand the
characteristics of the signal. Denoising has an important role in signal analysis by removing the signal
noise and retain important information. In a state of statistical usually often associated with discrete
and rarely sampled on continuous functions. Nowadays, the stationary wavelet transform (SWT) from
the EEG signals mixed artefacts has been widely used in the denoising signal.

2 Methodology
Sample data of EEG signal obtained by experiments. Experiments in this study conducted
by eight untrained subjects, who are males aged 20-22 years with good health, thin hair and
without any abnormalities. The tools used in this experiment is the Emotiv EPOC wireless
EEG Neuroheadset which has 14 electrodes and 2 reference and the package comes with an
application programming interface (API). This will record EEG signals from the
experimental activities in which there are 128 data per second of one epoch. Before the
electrodes set on the tool, preferably sprinkled with a liquid electrolyte is inserted to
improve conductivity of the electrode. The coated electrode attached to the subjects scalp
based on channels F7, T7, O1, O2, T8 and F8, respectively (See Figure 1).

In the first scenario with the first stimulus, the data is recorded at normal conditions for
30 seconds. In the 31-32 seconds period, the sign '+' will appear in the screen to indicate a
preparation for the second stimulus. When the arrow stimulus appear (second stimulus),
subject must close their eyes for 30 seconds. For the third stimulus, start with the normal
conditions for about 18 seconds. Then in 18-20 seconds periods, the sign '+' will appear
again which is indicates the preparation for next stimulus. When the arrow stimulus appear,
the the subject start to blinking. The detail of all scenario are given in Table 1 and 2.
2.1 EEG signal processing
Wavelet theory is a relatively new concept developed. The properties of the wavelet are
given as follow: The time complexity is linear. Wavelet transform can be done perfectly
with the time that is linear; Wavelet coefficients that are rarely elected. Practically, most of
the wavelet coefficients of low value or zero. This condition is very beneficial, especially in
areas of compression or data compression. Wavelet can be adapted to different types of
functions, such as functions that are not continuous, and the function defined on bounded
domains [15]. In general, a common function of wavelet is defined as the following
equation [18 - 21].

where s and τ , s ≠ 0, denotes the scale and translation parameters, and t indicates time. In
the continuous wavelet transform, the signal is analyzed using a set of basic functions that
are related to scaling and simple transition. The development of the CWT is presented in
the following equation.

Wavelet decomposition is embodied in the input signal and the filtered, lowpass filter
generates a waveforms called approximation and highpass filter generates a random waves
called detail. The correlation of both filter with wavelet functions arranged in a hierarchy
scheme called multiresolution decomposition, where decomposition separates the signal
into "details" at different scales and "approximation". Decomposition and reconstruction
schemes, and its procedure are given in Figure 2 and 3.
The wavelet denoising aims to remove noise in the form of artefacts in EEG signals
recorded on while preserving the signal characteristics, regardless of the frequency content.

The process of denoising (noise reduction) based on the elimination or reduction of the data
signal is considered noise. In the use of wavelet denoising, there are many methods used to
reduce noise. Denoising is applied by downloading the form of signal threshold wavelet.
Input coefficients used discrete wavelet transform. With thresholding, wavelet transform
will be able to remove noise or other undesirable signals in the wavelet domain. Then, the
desired signal will be obtained after performing the inverse of the wavelet. With this
method, we need to understand the concept of wavelet coefficients that represent a
measurement at a frequency between the signal and wavelet functions are selected. Wavelet
coefficients calculated as a convolution of the signal and the wavelet function which is
associated with a bandpass filter. When we analyze the signal at a high scale, we obtain the
global information of a signal called approximation. And on a smaller scale, we obtain
information from a signal called details [ 26-28 ].

The input signal is the raw EEG data then decomposed by the decomposition of the
signal with noise on wavelet bases where there is information on signal wavelet coefficient.
Denoising can be obtained by thresholding wavelet coefficients. Denoising is done by
separating the wavelet coefficients with the download threshold. Generally, wavelet
coefficients associated with low frequency (hereinafter referred to as the coefficient of
approximation). While the high frequency (hereinafter
referred
to
as
the
coefficient of detail) is to be at denoise.
The wavelet denoising method using one of the families that Daubechies wavelet (dbN).
Daubechies db1 used is the decomposition level 3. Wavelet group is used to pass the signal
through wavelet transform blocks for the decomposition process, then the signal will be
decomposed into wavelet coefficients which will be in thresholding and denoising where
the process occurs. Thresholding function to eliminate noise and preserve the information
that is important to the maximum signal.
Raw EEG data was still contains some high frequency where the artefacts are at this
frequency. Wavelet method is performed to obtain signal finer and enhance noise removal
of artefacts by eliminating high frequency in order to obtain the final result of clean EEG
signals with amplitude 2-6 μV range of values where the value is smaller than the signal
Raw EEG signal. So the value of the amplitude of the wavelet denoising result is closer to
the EEG signal amplitude range.

4 Conclusion
The data sample has been obtained (hereinafter referred to as the raw EEG signal) and then
processed the signal artefacts that tend to be the dominant high frequency, signal denoising
with wavelet denoising. In order to obtain clean EEG signals with amplitudes of 2-6 µV
and the range of values of the dominant frequency is in the frequency of 8-13 Hz which
includes a group of alpha wave rhythm at the time of trial that showed subjects fully awake
and relaxed. So the proposed research method produces a signal with amplitude and
frequency ranges that approach the EEG signal. Wavelet denoising in this study using
Daubechies db1 signal denoising level 3 of SWT denoising 1-D, the necessary analysis
using different types of Daubechies to compare the results of denoising signal.
