Abstract
While literature has suggested that neurofeedback performance improves when sensory feedback is related to
the pathology under consideration, it is still difficult to represent a proper feedback representative of our emotional
state. In this study, we have initiated a collaboration between neuroscientists and artists to develop a visual
representation of emotions. Emotions were represented as particles moving in a white sphere according to
valence and arousal levels. Several possibilities for particle control were explored: direction of particles, their
concentration in a specific place, or their gravity. Participants were asked to evaluate these possibilities on scales
ranging from 0 to 5 on how artistic the different representations were and could be used as a clinical activity,
whether they thought they had successfully controlled the particles during the neurofeedback exercise, and
whether they had appreciated the experience. We found that controlling the direction and concentration of
particles was considered the most artistic, with an average score around 3 out of 5, and that 47% of the 107
participants considered the concentration of particles as artistic. In addition, we found that participants could
significantly control the direction of particles during this session. Our approach constitutes a first step before
evaluating the effectiveness of our emotional neurofeedback over several sessions.

Introduction
Neurofeedback is a technique that consists of
measuring in real time a neurophysiological activity in
order to extract a parameter of interest and present it
to the participant, typically via visual or auditory
feedback. The purpose is to teach the participant to
modify this parameter. Neurofeedback can be used
to improve cognitive performance, such as memory,
attention, or emotions (Gaume, Vialatte, MoraSánchez, Ramdani, & Vialatte, 2016; Gruzelier,
84 | www.neuroregulation.org

2014). It can be used in healthy people (Gruzelier,
2018), but it is mainly perceived as a therapeutic tool
for the treatment of mental disorders (e.g., epilepsy,
attention disorders, addiction, depression). There are
at least two ways in which regulating brain activity by
neurofeedback can be beneficial for the treatment of
mental disorders. Self-regulatory training can focus
on an abnormal process, such as hyper- or
hypoactivation of specific brain areas or networks.
But neuromodulation can also act in another way, by
activating or suppressing circuits that do not function

abnormally, but whose neuromodulation can
nevertheless produce clinical benefits (Linden, 2013).
This implies that clinical benefits can be achieved
through self-regulatory training that activates
compensatory circuits or inhibits circuits that appear
normal when viewed in isolation but contribute to
pathology-related dysfunction (Linden, 2014).
The important parameters to consider when
conducting a neurofeedback experiment are the
method of measuring neurophysiological activity, the
brain areas to be targeted, and the type of feedback
to be presented to participants. All these parameters
obviously depend on the phenomenon we want to
study. The two main techniques for measuring
neurophysiological activity in neurofeedback are
electroencephalography (EEG) and functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
EEG
neurofeedback consists of measuring the power of
cerebral electrical activity at frequency bands of
interest on a few electrodes placed on the surface of
the scalp, with a time accuracy of the order of a
millisecond. EEG neurofeedback has the advantage
of being easy to use and can be performed
ambulatory. Neurofeedback by fMRI is a relatively
recent development of neurofeedback based on
blood oxygenation contrasts from the blood-oxygenlevel-dependent (BOLD) signal (for reviews, see
deCharms, 2008; Sulzer et al., 2013; Weiskopf,
2012).
Neurofeedback training by fMRI can
overcome some of the limitations of traditional forms
of neurofeedback in EEG, thanks to its higher spatial
resolution and the integration of the entire brain. This
approach is noninvasive, spatially accurate, and
capable of targeting deep brain structures such as the
amygdala. Unlike EEG neurofeedback, the fMRI
technique does not really provide real-time feedback
because of the hemodynamic delay of about 5
seconds between current neural activity and the
vascular response that creates the fMRI signal.
However, this delay is not an obstacle to
neurofeedback when participants receive this
information prior to the experiment (Linden, 2014;
Weiskopf et al., 2004).
The cerebral area to measure and to be controlled by
the participant is a parameter that depends on the
phenomenon to be studied and is defined from the
existing literature in the field. In the case of using
neurofeedback to learn how to regulate emotions,
most EEG neurofeedback studies focus on the
activity of the prefrontal cortex, which acts as a
modulator of primary emotional responses, through
its connections with deep brain structures (Spielberg
et al., 2012). Dominant activity in right versus left
prefrontal areas is associated with withdrawal
85 | www.neuroregulation.org

behavior and negative emotions, while opposite
representation (i.e., higher activity on the left vs. right)
accompanies approach behaviors and positive
emotions (Davidson, 1988, 1998; Papousek et al.,
2014). Thus, the alpha frontal asymmetry recorded
in the EEG reflects functional differences between
approach and avoidance motivation systems (see as
reviews Coan & Allen, 2004; Davidson, 1992, 1998;
Harmon-Jones & Gable, 2018; Sutton & Davidson,
1997). Since alpha power is assumed to reflect a
decrease in metabolic activity (Cook, O'Hara,
Uijtdehaage, Mandelkern, & Leuchter, 1998;
Davidson, Ekman, Saron, Senulis, & Friesen, 1990),
reduced alpha activity in right prefrontal electrodes is
associated with negative emotions; for example, after
viewing unpleasant films (Papousek et al., 2014;
Wheeler, Davidson, & Tomarken, 1993). On the
other hand, reduced alpha activity on the left is related
to positive emotions; for example, after viewing happy
movies or listening to pleasant music (Arjmand,
Hohagen, Paton, & Rickard, 2017; Wheeler et al.,
1993).
Several case studies have shown the
effectiveness of training to control alpha asymmetry
to reduce depressive symptoms (Baehr & Baehr,
1997; Baehr, Rosenfeld, & Baehr, 1997; Choi et al.,
2011; Peeters, Oehlen, Ronner, van Os, & Lousberg,
2014).
Frontal asymmetries associated with
emotions and motivation have also been observed at
the theta band level (Aftanas & Golocheikine, 2001;
Ertl, Hildebrandt, Ourina, Leicht, & Mulert, 2013) and
at the upper beta band level (Paquette, Beauregard,
& Beaulieu-Prévost, 2009; Pizzagalli et al., 2002). In
addition to the measurement of emotional valence,
Ramirez and Vamvakousis (2012) added an
additional parameter in calculating the emotional
arousal, in order to conform to Russell’s emotional
representation model. Arousal is calculated as the
ratio between beta and alpha bands at the prefrontal
cortex. When associated with valence, it offers the
possibility to have a bidimensional representation of
emotions. In fMRI, neurofeedback techniques target
deep brain structures that cannot be recorded in the
EEG, such as the amygdala or the insula, which play
a major role in motivational approach and avoidance
systems (Cunningham, Arbuckle, Jahn, Mowrer, &
Abduljalil, 2010; Cunningham, Raye, & Johnson,
2005; Schlund & Cataldo, 2010; Spielberg et al.,
2012). Several pilot studies have explored the
feasibility of training to regulate emotions with fMRI
neurofeedback in patients with neuropsychiatric
disorders. These studies focused on the selfregulation of the anterior insula (Caria, Sitaram, Veit,
Begliomini, & Birbaumer, 2010; Caria et al., 2007) in
schizophrenic patients (Ruiz et al., 2013), and the
self-regulation of the left amygdala (Zotev et al., 2011;
Zotev, Phillips, Young, Drevets, & Bodurka, 2013) in

patients with bipolar or depressive disorders (Young
et al., 2014). While training to overregulate amygdala
activity had a potentially positive effect on depressed
patients (Young et al., 2014; Yuan et al., 2014),
training to underregulate may help reduce amygdala
hyperactivation and improve emotional regulation in
patients with bipolar disorder. The combination of
simultaneous recordings in EEG and fMRI in the selfregulation of emotions has also been explored
(Cavazza et al., 2014; Kinreich, Podlipsky, Jamshy,
Intrator, & Hendler, 2014; Meir-Hasson, Kinreich,
Podlipsky, Hendler, & Intrator, 2014; Shtark et al.,
2015; Zich et al., 2015). Cavazza and colleagues
(2014) found an increase in BOLD activity in the
prefrontal cortex while subjects regulated their frontal
asymmetry in neurofeedback. Similarly, a correlation
between the laterality of the BOLD signal at the
amygdala and the level of alpha-frontal asymmetry
has been observed (Zotev et al., 2016). Research on
MRI neurofeedback is expanding rapidly, and there is
no doubt that new methods of functional exploration
will emerge in the coming years (Linhartová et al.,
2019; Lubianiker et al., 2019; Paret et al., 2019).
The last parameter to be taken into account, namely
the sensory feedback presented to the participants, is
still little explored. Remarkably, psychosociological
factors, particularly motivational factors, which also
have a major influence on the potential clinical
effectiveness of neurofeedback, have been poorly
evaluated. Thus, whatever the pathology considered,
the majority of neurofeedback tasks are tedious, with
brain activity frequently represented in the form of
histograms whose level rises or falls in real time.
Recently, less abstract methods of representing
feedback have been used; for example, through the
use of immersive environments (Lubianiker et al.,
2019). Playful neurofeedback applications, such as
video games, have also been developed but are not
related to the pathology to treat, which raises
questions about their effectiveness. It has already
been pointed out that traditional approaches to brain
studies do not take into account the specificities of
each individual (Bagdasaryan & Quyen, 2013). Thus,
it is likely that a neurofeedback approach will have to
adapt to the pathology of interest. Exploratory
approaches to representing feedback in relation to
the activity you want to improve have been put in
place (Lubianiker et al., 2019). For example, using
neurofeedback to optimize the performance of actors,
participants saw themselves on stage thanks to 3D
glasses and the control of their brain activity made
possible to vary the brightness of the scene and to
reduce the noise of the audience (Gruzelier, 2014).
In the context of emotions and the management of
emotional disorders, representing feedback related to
86 | www.neuroregulation.org

the pathology is much more complex because it
raises the question about the possibility to represent
visually or auditorily an emotion. Since emotion is a
central part of people’s dealings with artworks, first
approaches have been tested in this direction; for
example, with color schemes that vary when one
must feel tenderness or anxiety (Lorenzetti et al.,
2018). Ramirez and colleagues performed a musical
neurofeedback task for treating depression in elderly
people (Ramirez, Palencia-Lefler, Giraldo, &
Vamvakousis, 2015). In that study, participants could
manipulate musical parameters in real time by
increasing the volume of music with a high arousal
state and increasing the tempo when the valence
level also increased (Ramirez et al., 2015).
As part of this project, we have initiated a
collaboration between scientists and digital artists to
develop a visual representation of emotions that can
be used in neurofeedback experiments. For this
purpose, it was necessary that, in addition to being
artistic, the feedback provided to participants be
controllable, and therefore usable in a clinical activity.
To establish a visual representation of emotions, the
artists involved in the project started from the very
definition of the word emotion. The term emotion has
an active connotation since it derives from the Latin
word emovere, to set in motion (which gives the terms
movement, motivation).
Thus, emotions were
represented as moving particles slightly tinged
according to their location within a white sphere.
Several possibilities for particle control have been
proposed to determine which would be most effective
in a neurofeedback exercise. This study evaluated
these different control options at several public events
to determine which artistic representation would be
most appropriate for neurofeedback. To do this, we
not only evaluated the artistic aspect of the exercise
but also the sensation of particle control and the
pleasure of performing the task, which are major
motivational parameters to be taken into account in
neurofeedback.

Methods
Population
This study included 107 participants, 51 men and 56
women aged 27.6 (±17.1) years on average. Prior to
the experiment, oral informed consent was obtained
from all participants. The study took place either in
laboratory conditions or at various scientific and
artistic events in 2018, namely Brain Week, European
Researchers’ Night, the VIVO exhibition “Entrez en
nature!” and the Hacking Health Besancon.
According to French law, this study was classified as
a psychology observational study outside of the Jardé

law and did not require submission to an ethics
committee. All procedures performed in studies
involving human participants were in accordance with
the ethical standards of the institutional and/or
national research committee and with the 1964
Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or
comparable ethical standards.
Course of the Experiment
At the beginning of the experiment, participants were
comfortably seated in a chair, informed of the
experimental procedure, and instructed to remain as
calm as possible and to not move for the duration of
the experiment of about 15 minutes. An EEG headset
was then installed with an impedance check lasting
about 5 minutes. A 2-min rest recording was then
made to establish a baseline of valence and arousal
values. Then, subjects were instructed to try to reach
a specific emotional state. Four types of emotional
states could be asked of participants, according to
Russell’s model (Russell, 1980): either a positive
valence and a high arousal (emotion of joy or
excitement), a positive valence and a low arousal
(emotion of calm, relaxation), a negative valence and
a high arousal (emotion of irritation, anger), or a
negative valence and low arousal (emotion of
sadness, fatigue).
Brain Data Acquisition
The EEG data were acquired from an EEG Emotiv
EPOC+ system (EMOTIV Inc., San Francisco, CA).
This system consists of 16 saline-based electrodes
and a wireless amplifier. The electrodes are located
at positions AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8,
T8, FC6, F4, F8, AF4, according to the International
10–20 system. Two electrodes located just above the
ears (P3, P4) are used as a reference. The data is
collected at a sampling rate of 128 Hz and transmitted
to the computer via Bluetooth.
Although EEG Emotiv systems, which are relatively
inexpensive, provide a lower quality signal than when
the signal is obtained on more expensive EEG
devices (but see Dikker et al., 2017), the choice of this
material was based on the pragmatic advantages of
such a device. The installation time of each Emotiv
EPOC+ system is considerably shorter, about 5
minutes, than for gel-based systems, where the gel
application for each electrode can ultimately last up to
one hour, which considerably extends the duration of
the experiments. In addition, since the focus of this
study was on evaluating the graphical interface,
signal quality was not the main measurement
criterion.

87 | www.neuroregulation.org

Processing of EEG Data
EEG processing of valence and arousal is based on
methods already used in previous studies (Ramirez
et al., 2015; Ramirez & Vamvakousis, 2012) using a
two-dimensional arousal-valence design (Russell,
1980). Data were collected every 2 s. To determine
the valence level, the activation levels of the cortical
hemispheres were compared. The F3 and F4
electrodes were used to compare alpha activity on the
right and left hemispheres because they are located
above the prefrontal lobe.
Valence was thus
calculated by comparing the alpha power at the
electrodes F3 and F4 (i.e., by applying the following
formula: AlphaF4 − AlphaF3). The arousal level was
determined by calculating the ratio of beta (12–28 Hz)
and alpha (8–12 Hz) oscillations, which may be a
reasonable indicator of an individual’s arousal level
(Ramirez et al., 2015).
The EEG signal was
measured on the four electrodes AF3, AF4, F3, and
F4, which are located above the prefrontal cortex, and
arousal was calculated as follows: (BetaF3 + BetaF4
+ BetaAF3 + BetaAF4) / (AlphaF3 + AlphaF4 +
AlphaAF3 + AlphaAF4).
No method of correcting or removing artifacts was
applied to the EEG signal.
To minimize eye
movements, participants were asked to fix the center
of the screen during each experiment. To minimize
muscle artifacts, participants were asked not to move.
If signal quality was not central to this study, in the
next steps of performance measurement these
parameters will have to be monitored.
Artistic Representation of Participants’
Emotional State
Three types of visual representations were evaluated
by participants (Figure 1). All were based on the
same principle, namely a representation of emotions
in the form of particles tinted according to their
location and moving in a white sphere. These
particles appeared gradually throughout the
experiment.
From this common basis, each representation had its
own specificities. Each interface played with these
particles by modulating the forces applied to them. In
the first representation, group of particles moved up
or down according to the arousal level, and to the right
or left according to the valence level. Thus, for a
negative emotion with low arousal, the particles
moved to the lower left level of the sphere.
Depending on the emotion they were requested to
reach, the participants tried to move the particles to a
specific part of the sphere. Participants visualized in
real time the moving particles in order to give them
the feeling of absolute control over their brain activity

(see https://youtu.be/c_6IfurxzLc for a video of
Representation 1). In the second representation, the
objective was to gather the particles in the center of
the screen. If the subject was able to modulate his
brain activity to the right emotional state, the particles
moved towards the center and remained in this
position. If the brain activity did not correspond to the
requested emotional state then the particles would
move
back
to
the
periphery
(see
https://youtu.be/ZeXl43Z7DRU for a video of
Representation 2). For the third representation, the
objective was to achieve the fastest particle drop from
the top to the bottom of the screen until it stuck to the
bottom. The more the subject was able to reach the
correct emotional state, the faster the particles fell
from the top to the bottom of the screen. The more
the brain activity moved away from the requested
state, the more the particles fell slowly (see
https://youtu.be/fuxBEpWwpFA for a video of
Representation 3).

The programming of this software is based on the
Processing language and intensively uses the
physical simulation library adapted for the language
by Daniel Shiffman Box2D. The communication
between this program and the software that receives
and processes the EEG information is done via the
OSC protocol, with values ranging between 0 and 100
for valence and arousal. Each visual representation
was projected on a circular screen via a video
projector. The duration of each exercise was 3 min.
89% of the subjects did the same exercise twice, each
time with different emotional states to achieve.
Data Collection
EEG data collected in real time were automatically
processed to indicate whether the subject had
achieved the right emotion during the experiment.
For each experiment, the percentage of times a
subject had reached the correct level of valence and
the correct level of arousal was reported.
In addition, at the end of the experiment,
questionnaires were distributed to participants who
were asked to indicate on scales between 0 and 5
how the task was artistic, could be used as a clinical
activity, whether they felt they had succeeded in
controlling particles during the neurofeedback
exercise, and whether they had enjoyed the
experience.

Results

In Representation 1 at the top left, participants had to move
the particles to a specific part of the screen. In the
Representation 2 at the top right, the participants had to be
able to concentrate the particles in the center of the screen.
In Representation 3 at the bottom, the objective was to drop
the particles as quickly as possible from the top to the
bottom of the screen.

To determine the perception of the audience for the
three visual representations, we used nonparametric
statistical analyses. With regard to the artistic aspect
of the neurofeedback experience, large differences in
assessment were observed (Kruskal-Wallis, p
= .0002), the artistic assessment of Representation 3
being significantly lower than the other two
representations (Mann-Whitney, p = .004 compared
to Representation 1 and p = .0002 compared to
Representation 2). For the evaluation of the clinical
aspect of each representation, a significant difference
was also observed (Kruskal-Wallis, p = .03). The
clinical evaluation of Representation 3 was lower than
that of Representation 2 (Mann-Whitney; p = .03). To
assess whether subjects felt they were in control of
the task, only a tendency was observed (KruskalWallis; p = .06).
Finally, with regard to the
assessment of the task, very high scores were
reported for the three tasks, with no significant
differences between them (Kruskal-Wallis; p = .12).
To further explore the difference of artistic perception
between the three types of representation, we
reported an experience as artistic when participants
gave a note of 4 or 5, and nonartistic when
participants gave a note of 0 or 1, a method already
used before (Zhang, Jadavji, Zewdie, & Kirton, 2019).
We found that in Representation 2, 47% of
participants reported having an artistic experience

(Positive) when participants gave a score of 4 or 5, a
partially artistic (Neutral) experience with a score of 3, and
a nonartistic (Negative) experience with a score of 1 or 2.
In Representation 2, almost half of the participants reported
performing an artistic neurofeedback task.

Neurofeedback Evaluation
Although the main purpose of this study was to
evaluate the artistic aspect of the device, we did
evaluate the participants' ability to correctly modulate
their brain activity during their first session. We
compared the percentage of subjects who managed
to move the particles according to instruction
requested by the experimenter (e.g., positive valence
and positive arousal), and compared the results to the
chance level set at 25% (one in four chance of being
in the right area).
For none of the three
representations were the subjects able to significantly
reach the correct region (t-test, p > .1 for all
representations).
In the absence of an overall effect, we measured
whether subjects were able to control one of the two
components (valence or arousal). To study if the
subjects had managed to go more easily in one of the
components, the chance level was then set at 50%.
For valence alone, no representation gave significant
results (t-test, p > .1 for Representations 1 and 2; p
> .5 for Representation 3). For arousal alone, only
the performances of Representation 1 were
significantly higher than random (t(44) = 2.92, p

Finally, we compared whether performance improved
in subjects who performed the experiment twice (40

representations separately as well as overall, no
improvement was observed (paired t-test, p > .1 for
all).

Discussion
The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate
whether neurofeedback experiments used in
therapeutics could also be artistic. The need for an
artistic neurofeedback interface is emerging as the
scientific community's opinion about the effectiveness
of neurofeedback is very widely divided (Arns,
Heinrich, & Strehl, 2014; Micoulaud-Franchi & Fovet,
2016; Micoulaud-Franchi et al., 2015), with an
optimistic part thinking that neurofeedback can be
effective and a skeptical part for whom
neurofeedback training has no scientific or
therapeutic value. Thus, it was important that the
proposed activity not be seen as just a game and that
it really helps to regulate emotions. During the
realization of the interface, artists were requested to
create a representation, concrete or abstract, of
emotions and not only a game unrelated to the final
goal of the project (treatment of emotional disorders).
Studies have shown that the more playful an
application of neurofeedback is, the better the
performance (Bayliss, Inverso, & Tentler, 2004; Oude
Bos & Reuderink, 2008), provided that the playful
aspect is related to the pathology considered (Arns et
90 | www.neuroregulation.org

al., 2017). According to Bandura (1999), people live
in a psychological environment that they have largely
created themselves. Many people are in distress
because they are ruminating and cannot control
disturbing thoughts. Controlling mental processes is
thus a key factor in the self-regulation of emotional
states. If neurofeedback is intended to be beneficial
to patients by helping them control their own mental
processes and therefore their emotional states,
having a visual representation of these states can be
particularly useful (Linden, 2014).
Our goal was to evaluate the most appropriate type of
visual feedback to represent emotions. The choice to
represent emotions under the form of particles was
dictated by the dynamism of this representation. The
different forces at play in the organization of particles
make them constantly in motion. It is this permanent
movement that induces the most interesting aspect; it
is the nonpunitive response to the objective. The
result of the patient's attempt is not right or wrong, it
tends towards or away from the objective, in a natural
movement, which can be reminiscent of a lens on a
body of water. Particles react with each other to
collision, friction, rebound, and sometimes gravity. Of
the three representations that were tested, the first
two obtained a similar clinical and artistic evaluation,
with higher scores for Representation 2. In future
experiments, the choice of the artistic representation
will depend on the purpose of the neurofeedback
task: Representation 1 allows visualizing precisely
where the subject's emotional state is located, while
Representation 2 mainly gives a binary response
(particles are in the center for good emotional state
and in the periphery otherwise). Representation 1
requires the integration of the two parameters but has
the advantage of being superimposable with the
Russell circumplex, which is interesting from a
didactic point of view. However, despite similar
scores with Representation 1, almost 50% of
participants perceived Representation 2 as artistic,
compared to 30% of participants in Representation 1.
Representation 2 may better meet the objective of the
study, thanks to a visual representation that is less
punitive than in other tasks in the event of an error.
Therefore, this task may be considered as the entry
point in this set of three experiments in a therapy
framework. Representation 3 resulted in poorer
artistic and clinical evaluations, possibly because
participants felt a competitive aspect in having to drop
the balls quickly. In addition, in this representation, it
is more difficult to know if brain activity is well
controlled since the participant does not have a
particle fall rate reference on which to refer. It is
interesting to note how the modification of a single
parameter, in this case the gravitational force, can

have major implications on the artistic and clinical
perception of the task. In terms of the pleasure of
completing the task, the results of the three
representations are encouraging since the subjects
greatly appreciated participating in the experiment
and had the impression that they were controlling the
particles.
These parameters are important to
motivate a subject to repeat a neurofeedback
experiment, because in some cases, more than 30
sessions are required to demonstrate neurofeedback
effectiveness (Marzbani, Marateb, & Mansourian,
2016).
Artistic scores may not be considered as very high,
with the average score in Representations 1 and 2
being around 3 out of 5, but it is important to note that
the aim was not to obtain the highest possible artistic
score, but to achieve a task that is perceived as
artistic and applicable in clinical practice. With the
development of portable and relatively inexpensive
EEG systems, there are now a number of projects
that have associated art with sensory feedback, with
no real possibility of clinical application. For example,
the GlobalMind project sought to combine art and
EEG activity to generate audiovisual effects. This has
led to the production of “Spectacle of the Mind” shows
presented to the general public. Another example is
the Ascent project (https://www.nytimes.com/2012
/06/24/fashion/the-ascent-levitating-in-brooklyn.html)
where an installation allows individuals to levitate by
modulating their ability to concentrate around an
auditory and luminous show. It is by controlling this
activity that participants can climb more or less high
in the air. In addition to these exclusively artistic uses
of real time feedback in EEG, other approaches have
been used with both an artistic and pedagogical
focus. For example, the project "My Virtual Dream"
was presented in Toronto in 2013 at the Nuits
Blanches art festival and measured EEG activities of
523 participants in a single night (Kovacevic, Ritter,
Tays, Moreno, & McIntosh, 2015). Participants
practiced simple EEG tasks targeting either a state of
relaxation or a state of concentration. During the
evening, an improvement in performance was
observed, observable after only 1 minute of training.
A dome that allows spatialization of the individual's
brain activities and has also been developed to
improve the individual's immersive appearance
compared to a simple screen (Grandchamp &
Delorme, 2016). This tool is intended to illustrate
scientific knowledge about the brain. The authors
also believe that this type of artistic and immersive
environment would increase patients’ motivation
while reducing their training time and fatigue. Of
course, such a dome remains difficult to use in
common clinical practice.

In this study it is important to dissociate the emotion
measurement device from the representation
interface. As the main purpose of this neurofeedback
pilot was to evaluate the artistic aspect of the
interface, data processing, signal filtering, real-time
rejection of flashes, and eye or muscle movements
were not optimally exploited, although they can have
a major influence on the quality of EEG plots.
Similarly, it is possible to improve the quality of the
EEG signal by using gel-based electrodes. Here we
measured emotions with the material and parameters
already described in the literature to calculate valence
and arousal (Ramirez et al., 2015). However, it is
important to note that this interface could be used with
different methods of measuring emotions and on
different populations. For example, there are other
methods for detecting emotions in EEGs; for
example, with connectivity analysis (Koush et al.,
2017). In this case, subjects must regulate the topdown activity of the prefrontal cortex to the amygdala.
This artistic interface could also be applied to fMRI,
the other major neuroimaging method for measuring
emotions. Although the fMRI technique provides only
indirect measurements of neural activity and has a
much lower temporal resolution than the EEG, its
spatial resolution and access to deeper structures
make it an attractive tool for network mapping and
neurofeedback. Depending on the method chosen
and the brain region targeted, this emotional
measurement interface could potentially be applied
for the treatment of mental disorders such as
depression, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorders.
This study is the first step, and several points remain
to be clarified to test the effectiveness of this type of
artistic representation. First, it is not known how well
the subjects were trying to achieve the requested
emotional state. We did not control the extent to
which subjects used different strategies among
themselves and over time, which can strongly
influence neurofeedback performance. Moreover,
from a methodological point of view, it will be
necessary to establish a control condition, a critical
point in any neurofeedback study, to verify whether
the effect comes from the experience itself or from
other factors such as the attention given to the patient
(Micoulaud-Franchi & Fovet, 2018; Thibault & Raz,
2017). In addition, it is well known that the placebo
effect can have a significant influence on the
outcome. However, if the result is present, the use of
such a method may be acceptable, even as a placebo
(Thibault & Raz, 2016). Finally, future evaluations will
have to assess whether the artistic interface manages
to keep the level of motivation of participants at a high
level during repeated experiences. Although all
subjects strongly appreciated performing the

experiment and felt that they were controlling the
particles, it is likely that this motivation will gradually
decrease and will need to be assessed in comparison
to other types of visual feedback.

Conclusion
In this first approach involving the collaboration
between neuroscientists and digital artists, we were
able to set up a neurofeedback interface for emotion
regulation that is perceived as both an artistic and
clinical activity. It will remain to be explored whether
the therapeutic effect of neurofeedback can make
clinical sense and how to carry out a neurofeedback
examination in an optimal way. For this reason, the
design of appropriate control conditions for clinical
trials is a real challenge. It will also be necessary to
identify precisely the patient populations for which
neurofeedback can work.
The cognitive and
motivational
factors
underlying
effective
neurofeedback training are largely unknown. For
example, if this interface is to be applied to patients
suffering from anhedonia, the subcomponents
causing the anhedonic disorder should be well
separated because they may originate in different
brain regions (Thomsen, 2015).
