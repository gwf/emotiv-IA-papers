Localization Using Low-Density Headsets

Abstract Electroencephalography (EEG) has enjoyed considerable attention over the past century
and has been applied for diagnosis of epilepsy, stroke, traumatic brain injury and other disorders
where 3D localization of electrical activity in the brain is potentially of great diagnostic value. In this
study we evaluate the precision and accuracy of spatial localization of electrical activity in the brain
delivered by a popular reconstruction technique sLORETA applied to EEG data collected by two
commonly used low-density headsets with 14 and 19 measurement channels, respectively. Numerical
experiments were performed for a realistic head model obtained by segmentation of MRI images. The
EEG source localization study was conducted with a simulated single active dipole, as well as with
two spatially separated simultaneously active dipoles, as a function of dipole positions across the
neocortex, with several different noise levels in the EEG signals registered on the scalp. The results
indicate that while the reconstruction accuracy and precision of the sLORETA method are
consistently high in the case of a single active dipole, even with the low-resolution EEG
configurations considered in the present study, successful localization is much more problematic in
the case of two simultaneously active dipoles. The quantitative analysis of the width of the
reconstructed distributions of the electrical activity allows us to specify the lower bound for the spatial
resolution of the sLORETA-based 3D source localization in the considered cases.

1 Introduction
As a non-invasive modality for monitoring brain activity, Electroencephalography (EEG) has enjoyed
considerable attention over the past century [1, 2]. In the most wide-spread of its forms, EEG
measures the voltage potentials (in the order of micro-volts) at various locations on the scalp and
employs signal processing techniques to infer the electrical activity inside the brain. Brain activity
information accessible in EEG is largely complementary to that in MRI: EEG has excellent time
resolution (down to a few milliseconds), but poor space resolution (few centimeters). In addition to
the spectral content analysis of EEG recordings at multiple electrode locations on the scalp, spatial
localization of the sources of electrical activity inside the brain has also been the subject of active
research [3, 4]. EEG has been recently applied for diagnosis of epilepsy [3], stroke [5, 6], traumatic
brain injury [7] and other disorders where 3D localization of abnormal electrical activity in the brain
is potentially of great diagnostic value. Therefore, it is important and timely to quantify the precision
and accuracy of 3D spatial localization provided by popular techniques such as sLORETA [8].

It is well established that neural electrical activity of the brain can be approximated in EEG by sets of
virtual current dipoles [1, 2]. Source localization works by first finding the scalp potentials produced
by virtual dipoles at arbitrary locations in the brain (i.e. solving the forward problem), then, in
conjunction with the actual EEG data measured by the electrodes, it is used to work back and estimate
the sources that best fit the measurements (i.e. solving the corresponding inverse problem). In the
cases where the number of measurement points (electrodes) is lower than the number of unknowns
(i.e. potential positions inside the head of the electrical dipoles with unknown current strength and
orientation) this inverse problem is severely ill-posed [9, 10] in the sense that there is an infinite
number of source configurations that can produce the same distribution of the electric potential on the
surface of the head. Hence additional constraints need to be introduced in order to produce an
appropriate unique solution. Note, however, that even with infinitely many data measurement points
on the scalp, the spatial resolution of the EEG inversion will be limited due to the spreading of the
electromagnetic signal on propagation through the head [2], which implies a non-uniqueness and/or
severe instability of solutions to the source localization problem at high spatial resolutions.
Various methods have been proposed for choosing suitable constraints for the inverse EEG problem,
the most well-known being the ‘minimum norm’ constraint [11, 12]. Techniques relying on the
‘minimum norm’ constraint are based on a search for the solution with minimum power, and
correspond to Tikhonov regularization [9]. In other words, when the system is underdetermined, the
solution is obtained by minimizing its L2-norm [13]. Several variants of this approach that consider
different regularization parameters and weighting factors have already been proposed in the literature
[9, 14]. The present paper is focused on the sLORETA method [8], which also relies on the electrical
current density estimate given by the minimum norm solution and then “standardizes” it by using its
expected variance [8]. The expected variance here is hypothesized to be due to the actual source
variance (“biological noise”) and the variance due to noisy measurements (“electronic noise”) [14].
While in many cases sLORETA tends to produce very broadly distributed or “smeared” sources in the
reconstruction region, it remains very popular among EEG researchers because of its reconstruction
speed and its remarkable capacity to ensure zero localization error in the case of a single source and
noiseless environment [17]. Even though the solution produced by sLORETA is typically blurry,
when the sources are large in number and extended, sLORETA was found to be superior compared to
some high resolution algorithms [15]. Besides, some high-resolution algorithms depend on lowresolution algorithms, such as sLORETA, for robust initialization. For instance, Shrinking LORETAFOCUSS [16] and Standardized Shrinking LORETA-FOCUSS [15] are two particular examples
where sLORETA has been used to ensure the robust initialization.
The present study aims at quantifying the localization error of sLORETA in the presence of noise,
including the estimation of the spatial resolution of the reconstructed signal in the case of single
dipole activation, and the localization error in the case of multiple dipole activation. In a paper by
Wagner et al. [17], a similar study was conducted using a ‘three spherical shells’ model with 16,375
dipoles and a 81-electrode setup. Ding et al. in [18] compared sLORETA with several state-of-the-art
methods in regard to localization error and orientation sensitivity. An experimental study was
performed on a three-shell boundary element (BE) [19] model with 500 dipoles and a 32-channel
electrode setup. In the present work we consider a realistic head model obtained by the segmentation
of MRI images, with 6203 dipole locations uniformly distributed over the whole segmented volume of
the neocortex, along with two different electrode setups (Fig.1) that correspond to two popular EEG
headsets [20, 21]. Because the problem of reconstructing the 3D electrical activity of the brain from
the signals collected on the surface of the head is highly underdetermined and ill-posed (as explained
above), a small change in the considered model can potentially cause large changes in the solution.
Realistic head models with high-density electrode setups have already been used in literature to
investigate the reconstruction accuracy of sLORETA and related methods [15]. The present study is
primarily aimed at a quantitative evaluation of the reconstruction accuracy that can be delivered by
the sLORETA method applied to the EEG data collected by low-density EEG headsets, in the case of
2

a single and multiple simultaneous sources of electrical activity in the brain and different noise levels
in the data, including the estimation of the difference in the accuracy of the reconstruction results as a
function of the number of electrodes in a low-density EEG setup.

2 Mathematical Formulation
The equation often used for defining the forward and inverse imaging problems in EEG has the
following form:
Φ  KJ  c1.
(1)
3 N E1

Here Φ  

is a vector of the scalp electric potentials measured by the NE electrodes with
3 N 1

respect to a certain reference potential, J   V is the primary or impressed current density vector,
where NV is the number of considered dipole locations in the brain, with each dipole current having
three independent components corresponding to the usual Cartesian coordinates in 3D space,

K  N E N3V is the so-called lead field matrix, c is a constant5 and 1   N E1 is a vector of ones.
When the average reference transforms [8] of Φ and K are used, equation (1) can be simplified:
Φ  KJ .
(2)
T
T
Here the centering matrix, H  I - 11 / 1 1 is used as the average reference operator and
I  N E N E is the identity matrix.
Equations (1) and (2) are severely under-determined with respect to the vector J , as typically one has
NE << NV. Hämäläinen et al. [22] were the first to propose a meaningful solution for this ill-posed
problem. The minimum norm solution of eq.(2) in [22] was based on minimizing the cost function

F  || Φ  KJ || 2   || J || 2 .

(3)

The vector Ĵ , which minimizes equation (3), was computed as Jˆ  LΦ where L  K T [ KK T  H ] ,
where “+” denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse, and  is the regularization parameter. While
the minimum norm solution is quite easy to compute, it is notorious for misplacing the deep sources
5

Constant c embodies the fact that an electric potential is determined up to an arbitrary constant. It allows the
use of any reference for the lead field and measurements [8].

[8]. The method proposed by Dale et al. [23] enhances the minimum norm solution through the socalled “standardization” of the current density estimates. Nevertheless, Dale et al.’s method still
produces a systematic non-zero localization error. The method subsequently proposed by PascualMarqui and named sLORETA [8] produces zero localization error (at least in the case of a single
source and a noiseless environment). sLORETA relies on the following estimate of the standardized
current density power [8]:

JˆlT {[ S Jˆ ]ll }Jˆl .

(4)

Here S Jˆ  L( KK T  H ) LT  K T ( KK T  H )  K.

Robustness of sLORETA with Respect to Noise

Experiments were conducted on a realistic head model that was obtained by segmentation of MRI
images of the head and included four different major components, namely scalp, skull, Cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) and brain with the following relative conductivity values [2]: scalp=1, skull=0.05, CSF=5,
brain=1. The head model was defined on a discrete grid with a grid step of 1.25mm. The source space
was constructed by dividing the head model into cubes with a side of 5mm and considering possible
current dipoles only in those cubes that consisted of at least 60% gray matter. This segmentation
procedure resulted in 6203 dipole positions. In general, dipoles can be of different strength and
randomly oriented, however in the present experiment, we considered for simplicity that the active
dipoles had unit length and were vertically oriented. Electrode locations corresponding to a 19channel Compumedics (Setup I) and 14-channel Emotiv EPOC (Setup II) headsets were used for the
study.
One of the aims of this work was to study the localization accuracy of sLORETA in regard to noise.
When analysing real EEG data, the potentials measured on the scalp can be disturbed by several
factors such as measurement noise, mislocalization of the electrodes, etc. [24, 25], which all can
potentially induce errors in solutions of the source localization problem. Here we will investigate the
effect of simulated pseudo-random measurement noise superimposed on the measured scalp
potentials.
First, a single active dipole was considered and the corresponding potentials at the electrodes were
calculated using eq.(2) with a lead-field matrix calculated by solving the direct EEG problem, i.e. by
solving the corresponding second-order elliptical partial differential equation with piecewise-constant
coefficients (corresponding to the constant conductivity values within each of the four segmented
components of the head as described above). We then added variable amounts of noise to each of the
calculated electrode potentials. Simulated, as well as realistic noise was considered in the experiment.
The simulated random noise was modeled as statistically independent Gaussian noise with zero mean
and standard deviation  . For a given Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), the standard deviation was
e
e
computed as   max{(PSignal
(in V ) was the signal measured by the electrode
)} / SNR where PSignal
e (e 1 : N E ) . The realistic noise was generated using real EEG data collected with an Emotiv EPOC
headset [20]. In the latter case, 1000 consecutive samples of the EEG data samples from an interval
showing no significant spikes were selected. For each electrode channel, the mean value of the 1000
data points was subtracted from the signal, and then the signal was re-scaled dividing it by its standard
deviation. The new standard deviation was then imposed, depending on the desired SNR, in the same
way as for the simulated pseudo-random noise above. One out of the resultant 1000 data values was
chosen randomly for each trial and added to the signal to emulate the realistic noise in the measured
EEG data. The experiment was repeated for each of the 6203 dipole locations in the brain, and for
4

different levels of SNR (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and infinity).
After the reconstruction was performed using sLORETA, the position of maximum standardized
current density given by eq.(4) was considered as the position of the reconstructed source. The
Euclidian distance between the exact source location and the reconstructed one was calculated as a
measure of the localization error. As we were adding a random amount of noise, the above mentioned
experiment was conducted 100 times for each dipole location Di (i 1 : NV ) , and the average
localization error for the 100 runs was computed as the final localization error for the dipole Di. The
experiment was performed for both electrode setups I and II. The average localization error over the
6203 dipoles, the standard deviation of the error, the maximal and minimal localization error are listed
in Table 1 with respect to each SNR level. Unsurprisingly, the localization error increases with the
increase in the level of noise, however for the dipoles located in the deeper cortex areas this effect is
more prominent than for the dipoles located in the superficial cortex. At the same time, Setup II (14
electrodes) was found somewhat more susceptible to noise than Setup I (19 electrodes). Figure 2
shows the mean localization error for 6203 test dipoles for different SNR levels for the two different
electrode setups for simulated noise. More details about the spatial distribution of the error over the
6203 dipoles can be found in Fig. 3.

In the case of realistic noise we conducted experiment only for Setup II and found the results to be
very similar to those in the case of the simulated noise. For SNR of 30, the mean localization error
was 3.8 mm; the localization error increased with the decrease of SNR, and for SNR of 5, the mean
localization error was 22.20 mm. While the mean localization errors were similar both for the
simulated and the realistic noise, the standard deviation of errors was higher in the case of the realistic
noise.

4 Width of the Reconstructed Distribution for a Single Active Source
For a particular active dipole Di, and for noise-free potentials, the EEG source reconstruction was
performed using sLORETA. The reconstructed signal had a broad spatial distribution covering the
original source Di, with the maximum strength of the reconstructed signal located at Di. The
reconstructed signal strength was plotted as a function of the Euclidian distance between the dipole
locations (xi, yi, zi) and (xj, yj, zj) of dipoles Di and Dj (for j=1 to 6203). While the Euclidian distances
in that case can take any real value between 0 to 150 mm (size of the cortex in our model), for
presentation purposes we clustered the distances within the ranges 0-4 mm, 5-9 mm and so on,
averaging the dipoles strength within each cluster. Figure 4 shows an example of the plot of such a
reconstruction (for Setup I) corresponding to a single active dipole source located in the centre of the
neocortex. As expected, the maximum reconstructed signal strength was found at zero Euclidian
distance from the simulated dipole source.

Then we computed the width of the reconstructed distribution based on its second-order integral
moment, i.e. this width was defined as 2

(X

2
i

distance and the signal strength, respectively. Similar calculations were performed for all dipoles Di
(for i=1 to 6203) activated one at a time. Experiments were performed for both Setup I and Setup II.
Our findings inferred that depending on the dipole position in the neocortex, the width of the
reconstructed distribution varied. Numerically, the width varied between 63 mm to 110 mm having a
mean width of around 83 mm with the standard deviation of around 8 mm for Setup I. For Setup II,
the width varied between 72 mm to 153 mm having a mean of around 112 mm with a standard
deviation of around 14 mm. Active dipoles located in the lower occipital area led to broader width
distribution of the reconstructed signal compared to dipoles located in other parts of the brain, which
was presumably due to the poorer coverage of the corresponding scalp area by the electrodes.
Generally, as expected, the dipoles located deeper in the brain had higher width distribution compared
to the dipoles that are located closer to the electrodes (or scalp) and fall within the “good coverage
area” by the electrodes. However closely located (from the scalp) dipoles could have broader
distribution when they fall outside the “good coverage area” by the electrodes. Overall, these results
indicate that, in agreement with previously published results, while the maximum of the reconstructed
signal corresponds exactly (in the noiseless case) to the position of the single active source, the signal
distribution reconstructed using sLORETA method is quite broad. Figure 5 shows the distribution of
computed width over the considered 6203 dipoles, where gray levels represent the width of the
reconstructed signal when that dipole was active.

5 Evaluating sLORETA in the Case of Simultaneously Activated Multiple Sources
In the case of two active dipoles, one dipole, which we called the primary dipole Dprimary, was located
in one of the three fixed locations: (a) at the centre of the brain, or (b) on the surface of the occipital
lobe, or (c) on the surface of the temporal lobe. For each of the three positions of the primary dipole,
we considered a secondary dipole Di (i 1 : NV , Di  Dprimary ) , which was activated simultaneously
with the primary dipole. After the reconstruction was performed using sLORETA, positions of the
local maxima of the reconstructed signal were determined.
In this case, ideally, the reconstructed signal should have two local maxima coinciding with the
positions of the primary and the secondary dipoles. However because of the complex distribution of
the reconstructed signal produced by sLORETA, it was observed that, depending on the radius of the
area within which the local maximum search was performed, it was often possible to find one, two or
several local maxima in the reconstructed signal distribution. We adopted a strategy where, while
deciding whether a particular point was a local maximum or not, we considered whether it had higher
values compared to all other points within a sphere with the diameter Wi, with Wi being the width of
the corresponding reconstructed signal distribution that had been calculated at the previous stage of
the experimental study (with a single active dipole at the location of the centre of the sphere). Then
1
2
from the detected local maxima we chose two maxima Dmax
and Dmax
with the highest values of the
1
2
reconstructed signal (in the case of only one detected local maximum we chose Dmax
). The
 Dmax
1
2
location Dmax
corresponded to the position closest to the primary source, and Dmax
represented the
other source. Then the Euclidian distances between the two reconstructed sources and the
corresponding actual sources were computed, the average was taken as the localization error of
sLORETA in the case of two simultaneously active sources. Experiments were conducted for both
Setups I and II.

Figure 6 details the findings, where the horizontal axis represents the Euclidian distance between the
primary and the secondary sources and the vertical axis represents the percentage of cases where we
were able to detect 1 or 2 maxima in the reconstructed signal.

From these results, it is possible to conclude that when the distance between the primary and
secondary dipoles was considerably larger than the width of the source distribution produced by a
single active dipole, sLORETA was sometimes able to detect the two sources accurately. Note
however that, in addition to the distance between the active dipoles, the respective positions of these
dipoles in the brain also played a significant role for successful localization of the two maxima in the
reconstructed signal.
The effect of measurement noise on the localization error produced by sLORETA in the case of
simultaneously active multiple sources was also analysed. Unsurprisingly the localization error was
higher in the presence of noise. For Setup I and simulated noise with SNR of 30 the localization error
was about 37 mm while the primary dipole was located at the centre of the brain. For the primary
dipoles on the surface of the occipital lobe and on the surface of the temporal lobe the localization
errors were 49 mm and 46 mm respectively (for the same SNR). Decreased levels of SNR resulted in
the increase of the localization error, e.g. for the SNR of 5, the localization errors were 40 mm, 54
mm and 49 mm for the primary dipoles positioned at the centre of the brain, on the surface of the
occipital lobe, and on the surface of the temporal lobe respectively. For Setup II the computed
localization errors were 41 mm, 49 mm and 50 mm respectively for the primary dipoles positioned at
the centre of the brain, on the surface of the occipital lobe, and on the surface of the temporal lobe for
the SNR of 30. For the SNR of 5 those values were respectively 48 mm, 52 mm and 51 mm. In the
case of realistic noise with the SNR of 30 for Setup II the localization errors were 41 mm, 50 mm and
52 mm respectively for the considered dipoles positions. The SNR of 5 resulted in the localization
errors of about 50 mm, 54 mm and 53 mm respectively for the dipoles positioned at the centre of the
brain, on the surface of the occipital lobe, and on the surface of the temporal lobe respectively. It is
worth mentioning that the obtained numerical values here were based on the average of 10 successive
runs. It is obvious from these results that the localization error increased with the increase of noise
level, however this increase was not dramatic since the localization error for the two simultaneously
active sources without any noise was already quite large.

6 Discussion and Conclusions
In the present study we have quantitatively analysed and evaluated the performance of the sLORETA
method for EEG source localization, considering different levels of noise in the measured electrode
potentials and single and multi-dipole activation, for two different EEG electrode setups
10

corresponding to two popular EEG headsets with 14 and 19 active measurements channels,
respectively. In agreement with previous publications, the experimental results show that sLORETA
produces zero localization error when there is no noise in the measured signals and only one source
dipole is active at a time. Our study has confirmed that this result remains true even for the considered
low-density EEG headsets. However, it was found that the localization error is non-zero if any of
these two conditions is violated. We have also quantified the width of the reconstructed signal
distribution for a single active source. It has been already mentioned in the literature that sLORETA
produces a broad reconstructed signal; this study quantifies the width of that signal and thus specifies
the lower bound for the spatial resolution of the sLORETA method for the case of the considered
EEG configurations. We have performed this spatial resolution analysis first for the noise-free data,
and then systematically investigated the influence of different levels of the SNR on the width of the
reconstructed signal.
We have also analysed the performance of sLORETA EEG reconstruction for two simultaneously
active sources. It was found in previous publications (see e.g.[17]) that when two sources were active
simultaneously, they could only be separated in the reconstructed signal produced by sLORETA if
they were located far apart and were of similar strength; the worst performance was also observed for
parallel sources [17]. Knowing that in a real-life scenario the dipoles can be randomly oriented, the
present study focused on the worst case scenario. Our computer simulation results showed that, in
addition to the distance between the two active dipoles, their respective positions in the brain also
affects their detectability in the reconstructed signal produced by sLORETA. Overall, the localization
error in the case of two simultaneously active sources was found to be quite large (up to one third of
the head diameter on average) even in the noise-free case. This localization error increased further
when increasing levels of noise were added to the EEG data in our simulations, but the additional
deterioration of the reconstructed results in this case was relatively modest, due to the fact that the
errors were already quite large in the noise-free case.
In principle, it may be also interesting to analyse the performance of sLORETA for more than two
simultaneously active sources. However, taking into account the poor performance of sLORETA for
two simultaneously active sources, we can hypothesize that at least in the case of low-resolution EEG
setups (with a small number of measurement channels available) sLORETA will not be able to
successfully localize multiple simultaneously active sources. It may be worth, though, to study further
the quantitative performance of sLORETA in the case of low-density EEG headsets and broadly
distributed sources, which we plan to do in a subsequent work.
