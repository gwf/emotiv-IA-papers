ABSTRACT:
Given the limited number of human GIS/image analysts at any organization, use of their time and organizational resources is important,
especially in light of Big Data application scenarios when organizations may be overwhelmed with vast amounts of geospatial data.
The current manuscript is devoted to the description of experimental research outlining the concept of Human-Computer Symbiosis
where computers perform tasks, such as classification on a large image dataset, and, in sequence, humans perform analysis with BrainComputer Interfaces (BCIs) to classify those images that machine learning had difficulty with. The addition of the BCI analysis is to
utilize the brain’s ability to better answer questions like: “Is the object in this image the object being sought?” In order to determine
feasibility of such a system, a supervised multi-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to detect the difference between
‘ships’ and ‘no ships’ from satellite imagery data. A prediction layer was then added to the trained model to output the probability that
a given image was within each of those two classifications. If the probabilities were within one standard deviation of the mean of a
gaussian distribution centered at 0.5, they would be stored in a separate dataset for Rapid Serial Visual Presentations (RSVP),
implemented with PsyhoPy, to a human analyst using a low cost EMOTIV “Insight” EEG BCI headset. During the RSVP phase,
hundreds of images per minute can be sequentially demonstrated. At such a pace, human analysts are not capable of making any
conscious decisions about what is in each image; however, the subliminal “aha-moment” still can be detected by the headset. The
discovery of these moments are parsed out by exposition of Event Related Potentials (ERPs), specifically the P300 ERPs. If a P300
ERP is generated for detection of a ship, then the relevant image would be moved to its rightful designation dataset; otherwise, if the
image classification is still unclear, it is set aside for another RSVP iteration where the time afforded to the analyst for observation of
each image is increased each time. If classification is still uncertain after a respectable amount of RSVP iterations, the images in
question would be located within the grid matrix of its larger image scene. The adjacent images to those of interest on the grid would
then be added to the presentation to give an analyst more contextual information via the expanded field of view. If classification is still
uncertain, one final expansion of the field of view is afforded. Lastly, if somehow the classification of the image is indeterminable, the
image is stored in an archive dataset.
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Geospatial Big Data and Applications scenarios
Nowadays the rapid development of information technology has
led to the tremendous growth of data from various geospatial
sensors which can be defined as the era of big data (Li et al.,
2016). Typical application scenarios of geospatial big data
include but are not limited to: land use mapping (Joshi et al.,
2016 ), change detection (Wang et al., 2016) , natural and manmade disasters monitoring (Cernove et al., 2016). Geospatial Big
Data are composed of terrestrial geosensors (Reis, 2005), (Nittel
et al., 2005), social media data (Esmaili et al., 2013), terrestrial
and airborne LIDAR (Debie et al., 2020), aerial imagery from
manned and unmanned (UAS) platforms, satellite Earth
Observation Systems imagery with various spatial (Li et al.,
2008), temporal (Stellmes et al, 2013), and spectral resolutions
(Asadzadeh et al.,2016). Most current geospatial toolsets can be
termed as a “human-in-the-loop” in spite of increased amounts of
operations that are automated by computer algorithms; therefore,
research in optimization of the geospatial analysts’ workflow can
be important for overall productivity increase of geospatial
systems and toolsets.
1.2 Why human-computer symbiosis?

Most of the automated detection and identification algorithms for
objects/phenomena recognition in big data geospatial domains
compares radiometric and geometric parameters of the
objects/phenomena against parameters obtained as a result of
supervised or unsupervised training classification and match
them against some set of predefined decision rules.
Unfortunately, the practical usefulness of automated detection
and identification based on” press-a-button” derived results are
limited (Feferman et al., 2004), because geospatial imaging data
are burdened with residual errors and artifacts which have to be
manually inspected, cleaned, and corrected. These tasks
complicate large projects that require real-time processing of
immense amounts of geospatial big data information and require
a human analysts’ involvement in manual post-processing and
visual inspection of the automatically derived objects detection
and identification results.
This prompted us to consider developing a human-in-the-loop
semi-automated technology to enable the most efficient
processing of visual geospatial data. As humans, we perceive
and process vast amounts of information visually at extremely
high speed; therefore, it seems reasonable to combine this
human ability with the speed of computers to build a HumanComputer Symbiosis (HCS) platform for processing geospatial
data. This platform can be based on registering the cognitive
activity of analysts by means of brain electroencephalogram

(EEG) and visual attention of an analyst by real-time eyetracking.
While the human brain performs searches and analysis of
visual data, the analyst’s eyes intuitively scan the scene. Such
eye movements are driven by and indirectly represent results
of internal processes of visual searching and matching,
performed by the whole human visual system. By tracking and
analysing EEG and eye movements data (Eenwyk et al., 2008)
we can arrange a “smart” loop, with the computer performing
the rest of the tasks, where computation and data storage
predominate. Table 1 shows the relative strengths of brains and
computers for geospatial image analysis. As can be seen, the
combination of both would lead to a more complete analysis
where one would supplement where the other is lacking.

1.3 State-of-the-art: integrating automated and interactive
geospatial data processing.
An interesting experiment on integrating computer vision and
brain-computer interfaces is described in (Pohlmeyer et al.,
2011) and led to the development of the concept corticallycoupled computer vision (C3Vision) which refers to a particular
class of brain–computer interface (BCI) meant to combine the
complementary strengths of computer vision and human vision
to provide robust image search and retrieval in high throughput
tasks (Gerson et al., 2006), (Parra et al., 2008), (Sajda et al.,
2010). The C3 Vision is aimed to assist users in searching large
imagery databases. Specifically, Caltech-101 (Fei-Fei et al.,
2004) testing imagery dataset was deployed. Samples of images
were randomly selected and presented in what’s known as a rapid
visual serial visual presentation (RSVP). The computer vision
method deployed for image annotation was selected as a
transductive annotation graph (TAG) described in (Wang et al.,
2008) and (Wang et al., 2009). That is a semi-supervised learning
technique which uses a small subset of labelled images.
ActiveTwo Biosemi EEG with 64 electrodes was used for the
recording and determination of human-interest rate to the RSVP
data. C3Vision system enabled interaction between the human
and computer vision by means of cortical interface. Its
architecture was useful in reorganizing imagery in large diverse
data sets. However, the challenge of practical use of the cortical
interface-based system in geoinformatics is associated with:
1. Research on how RSVP will be efficient for complex
(aerial, satellite) imagery labelling
2. How easy-to-use EEG devices that do not require human
analyst scalp soaking can be deployed with significantly
reduced number of EEG electrodes.

Experimental Data

The experiment was conducted using a Kaggle dataset composed
of labelled satellite data (Planet Team, 2017). The dataset
included 1000 images of ships and 3000 images without ships.
Figure 2 shows a subset of the training data with labels.

Figure 3: Sample set of image prediction on a validation image
set

Figure 2. Sample set of image training images and labels
As it can be seen from Figure 2, there are errors in the labelled
data as gathered directly from Kaggle. For our purposes, the data
was too large to manually relabel the data in the time given, see
the future work section for a potential solution that takes
advantage of the application of BCI. As for the results, the
labeling errors exacerbate type I and type II errors; however, the
foundation of the model fits within supervised learning norms.
1.3

This method utilizes the properties of the modified ReLU
activation function and the resulting distribution of confidence
levels to forward those images with the lowest confidence for
extra analysis. Such a method reduces the need for a human
analyst input to better make use of their time.

Creating the Model and Results Obtained

The model was created using well developed convolutional
neural network training methods. The activation function used
during training was an unmodified ReLU that sets all negative
values to zero and keeps any positive values which performs well
on image data (Glorot et al., 2010) (Nair and Hinton, 2010). The
model also used “Adam” optimization for its computational
efficiency and low requirements for tuning (Kingma et al.,
2014). For the prediction layer a modified ReLu activation
function was added to scale the positive values to fit within the
range of 0 to 1. The resulting values were attributed with the
confidence the model had with its prediction. An example of the
resulting predictions and confidence can be seen in Figure 3. The
same logic that is used to create the red text for the
“misclassified” data is what is to be used to create a separate
dataset to be presented in RSVP for a fully connected system. In
order to determine if an image should then be forwarded to an
analyst for RSVP, the confidence value would need to fall within
the first standard deviation of the normal distribution shown in
Figure 4.

Rapid Serial Visual Presentation and ERP Analysis

The cost-efficient EMOTIV insight (Emotiv) EEG device for GI
ERP was used for recordings. Custom PsyhoPy script was
developed to perform rapid serial visual presentations of the
imagery to the subjects involved in the experiment.
Figure 5 below shows the PsychoPy user interface of the main
RSVP loop. The resulting Python script that executed the

presentation was automatically generated from this interface. The
analyst was presented with an initial image, “Target Acquisition”
to solidify what they were to search for. They were then presented
with a message preparing them for the RSVP. The images were
then looped through during “Test Trial” and when all of the
images were presented, the exit message was displayed
prompting them to seek the researchers to end the task.

Whereas the case of disagreement, we have:

Probabilistic mathematical approach for the
estimation of GI ERP extracted objects
Any information extracted from geospatial big data may have
inaccuracies associated with the nature of this data. This
inaccuracy may follow from the errors in machine learning
algorithms and human interpretation due to complexity of sensors
models and variety of conditions. In case of imaging information
such inaccuracy may follow from the known errors in image
features segmentation (which is known as “ill-posed problem”
(Marroquin et.al., 1987) and matching those features against
geospatial features presented in a pre-existing database of the
area. For the mathematical abstraction let’s assume that we will
compare probability of the object of interest found event or image
feature towards a simplistic binary model of “truth” and “false”.
In this case of binary simplification, the GI ERP operates vectors
𝑎𝑎⃗ and 𝑏𝑏�⃗ representing a current geospatial object (GO) and
database vector (DBV), respectively. When 𝑏𝑏�⃗ represents a full
data stream, and 𝑎𝑎⃗ represents only a particular view/state of a
particular object, a number of 𝑎𝑎⃗ permutations with N-number of
symbols (vector components), and M-number of “ones,” is

N!

W N ( m) =  m  =
  N! (N − m)!

(1)

,
where m!=m(m-1)(m-2).

Each 𝑎𝑎⃗ - permutation represents one specific object’s (for
example - airplane); typically, we have:
.

𝐿𝐿 ≅ 4𝑁𝑁

In this case, the 𝑏𝑏�⃗ -database stores all of the object views, which
are compared to a specific GO view, 𝑎𝑎⃗ , obtained geospatial big
data surveillance, such as:

, (2)

which represents the number of all possible binary permutations.
Typically, for example, for a face-front view of a airplane, we
have:

N ≅ 80

,

and a typical situation is almost balanced, i.e.,

m≅

.
For an exact balanced case we can calculate the number of
permutations as:

( )=

For N=80, we have:

In GI ERP context, we assume to use well-known automated
target recognition (ATR) so called Figures of Merit (FOMs) that
are based on Signal Detection Theory (SDT) (Macmillan,2002);
where conditional probabilities are applies (see, Table of Figure
6); p(SIS), p(SIN), p(NIS), p(NIN), translated as probability of:
hit, False-Alarm-Rate (FAR), miss, and correct-rejection,
respectively. In this formation, the conditional probability
p(AIB) means; if event (B) is present, then event (A) is detected.
For example, p(NIS) is probability of signal/target-detection
assuming that only noise-is-present. Thus, p(NIS) also means the
probability of False-alarm, or False-Alarm-Rate (FAR). We
should observe that p(d/I) is similar to p(SIS). Yet p(SIS) is
closer to our ERP scenario, when, on the basis of single, or few
images, we need to evaluate the probability of target recognition
(hit).

Table 2: Conditional probability according to the SDT model.
Based on this modelling, we here assume to establish Classes of
Equivalence (COEs), as shown in Figure 6. In more general than
in (Thom,1969) case, in addition to probability of hit, miss, FAR,
and correct rejection, we here also may compute cross-table
probabilities (CTP). During GI ERP development we investigate
and evaluate the COE-concept for specific classes of equivalence
related to emergency situations response application scenarios,
for example such as: Ship (A), No Ship (B).

processing, we captured more activities on the left lower back of
the brain during 300ms after the presentation of ships during
RSVP experiment rather than other parts of the brain.

This new dataset will then be used to locate the image within a
larger context, such as the scene in Figure 10; however, the entire
scene will not be loaded as that is computationally inefficient.
Instead, the images in question will be used to locate their
position within the larger scene via their coordinates. Once the
position is determined, the field of view is increased around the
original image by only gathering the eight adjacent images
around it, Figure 11 B. If certainty still doesn't increase beyond a
chosen threshold, the field of view will be increased once more
Figure 11 C. Finally, if the analyst still cannot be certain of what
is in the original image, it will be stored in a dataset with other
undeterminable images for archiving.

3. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH
Preliminary experimental results indicate a feasibility of the
human computer symbiosis within the big geospatial data
domain. Our future research will be devoted to increasing
accuracy and minimizing processing and analysis time for
obtaining results, including further software and algorithm
optimizations.
For improving the labelled dataset more quickly than traditional
methods, a form of Interactively Procedural Image Serial
Presentation can be used where interaction with the presentation
via button presses cause the next image to be shown. This
methodology can be used to show an analyst each image/label
pair. When an analyst sees the image in Figure 8, for instance,
they can press a button to inform the system that the image was
mislabelled which can then be programmatically set to correct the
label by moving the training image to the proper directory. This
method would be faster than an analyst opening up every image
in a poorly labelled dataset and manually moving the image files
to the proper classification directory.
