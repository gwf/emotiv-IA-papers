ABSTRACT

Article history:

Electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition systems are widely used as
diagnostic and research tools. This document shows the implementation of a
reconfigurable family of three affordable 8-channels, 24 bits of resolution,
EEG acquisition systems intended for a wide variety of research purposes.
The three devices offer a modular design and upgradability, permitting
changes in the firmware and software. Due to the nature of the Analog FrontEnd (AFE) used, no high-pass analog filters were implemented, allowing the
capture of very low frequency components. Two systems of the family,
called “RF-Brain” and “Bluetooth-Brain”, were designed to be light and
wireless, planned for experimentation where movement of the subject cannot
be restricted. The sample rate in these systems can be configured up to 2000
samples per second (SPS) for the RF-Brain and 250 SPS for the BluetoothBrain when the 8 channels are used. If fewer channels are required, the
sampling frequency can be higher (up to 4 kSPS or 2 kSPS for 1 channel for
RF-Brain and Bluetooth-Brain respectively). The third system, named “USBBrain”, is a wired device designed for purposes requiring high sampling
frequency acquisition and general purpose ports, with sampling rates up to 4
kSPS.

INTRODUCTION
Flexible electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition systems are required in a wide variety of research
fields including brain computer interfaces (BCI) [1], [2], evoked potentials (EPs) [3], [4] stress response [5],
[6], epilepsy [7]–[9], depth of anesthesia [10]–[12], among others. EEG systems’ extended use is due to its
noninvasive nature, high temporal resolution and lower cost compared with other modalities of brain activity
monitoring such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or magnetoencephalography (MEG).
Also, EEG devices do not require the restriction of the locomotion of the subject under test.
Commercial EEG research systems do not always offer flexibility to configure their settings, such as
sampling frequency, location and configuration of the electrodes and individual gain of the channels, among
others; and their prices can be high [13], [14]. The accessibility to these main features is critical in the
experimentation design. Depending on the study, it could be more convenient to have less active channels
and a higher sampling rate [15], [16]. Also, the selection of the reference electrode could significantly affect
the quality of the acquired data [17]–[19], but changing and testing different locations is time consuming;
thus, the possibility of selecting the reference electrode by software, among the electrodes already positioned

in the scalp of the subject, would facilitate the assessment of the reference electrode location. The
introduction of bias circuits in the EEG systems also improve the acquired signals by reducing the
interference of the common-mode and motion artifacts [20]. The function of a bias circuit is equivalent to the
right leg drive (RLD) circuits used in ECG systems. The possibility of selecting the source of the bias signal
could result in a better EEG signal. The reconfigurable systems presented in this work provide a suitable
experimentation tool at a lower cost than commercially available devices, for a broad range of
electrophysiological studies. They offer the possibility of changing critical features including sampling rate,
number of active channels, individual channel gain and channel input configuration to address the situations
mentioned above.
Figure 1 presents a block diagram of the family called “the brain family”. Three systems were
implemented: RF-Brain, Bluetooth-Brain and USB-Brain. RF-Brain and Bluetooth-Brain are portable,
battery-powered devices allowing experimentation where the movement of the subjects is not restricted; for
this reason, the size of these systems was kept as small as possible. On the other hand, USB-Brain is powered
by the USB port of the host computer where the signals are displayed and/or stored. All devices have a
common core composed by the AFE and the control and configuration modules. A. Modules of the
Bluetooth-Brain Transmitter can connect to an Android mobile device or to a PC with Bluetooth
connectivity. B. Modules composing the USB-Brain, which must be connected directly to a USB port of the
host PC. C. Modules for the RF-Brain Transmitter and RF-Brain Receiver. The RF-Brain Receiver connects
to a PC through a USB port

Figure 1. Block diagram of the Brain family of EEG acquisition systems

All the systems have three main components: hardware for acquisition, firmware that controls the
behavior of the systems and a computer or mobile device software for configuration, display and storage of
data, through a graphical user interface (GUI). These components were designed in a modular fashion in
order to provide the required flexibility in their settings. Devices are open-hardware and open-software.
Through a communications to the authors, researchers can retrieve all the necessary information to replicate
the systems.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Core of The Family
All designed systems share a common core (see figure 1) composed by two modules: analog frontend (AFE) and configuration and control.
2.1.1. AFE
Depending on the system, the AFE module may use one of the following integrated circuits (ICs)
from Texas Instruments®: ADS1298 or ADS1299. Both ICs have eight channels with an instrumentation
programmable gain amplifier (PGA) each one and 24 bit sigma-delta analog-to-digital converter (ADC).
PGAs offer a set of possible gains from 1 to 24. The resolution in bits of the ADC, along with these set of
gains provide an approximately resolution of 12 pV. For 16 bit systems, the required gain to achieve the same
resolution would have to be in the order of 103. AFEs maximum input bias current is 200 pA and 300 pA for
the ADS1298 and the ADS1299 respectively. These ICs have an input multiplexer per channel for device
noise measurement, test signal generation and acquisition, temperature measurement and supply voltage
measurement. Main features of the two ICs are listed in Table 1.

The ADS1298 was used in the RF-Brain and Bluetooth-Brain as it offers a lower power
consumption and a bigger supply voltage range as shown in Table 1, reducing the complexity of the energy
module and therefore the space required in the printed circuit board (PCB). These features are desired for
portable devices in order to offer more autonomy and less space and weight. Since the USB-Brain takes the
energy from the USB port, the restriction in power consumption is not relevant, for that reason the ADS1299
was used, offering a better input-referred noise and a bigger gain (up to 24) as shown in Table 1. In all
systems, the individual channel gain and the behavior of the input multiplexer can be selected from the user
interface or modified by firmware. These settings are sent to the configuration and control module and are
established at the beginning of the acquisition process.
In the Bluetooth-Brain system, all channels are single-ended, referred to a fixed electrode called
reference electrode which also serves as bias electrode. The RF-Brain also has single-ended channels, but it
offers the option of selecting the reference electrode between an independent electrode and one of the
channel electrodes; these settings are selected through the GUI and an analog switch located on the board of
the system, as shown in Figure 2. With the analog switch, the user can select to connect all negative inputs to
the reference electrode or to the pin called SRB2, which can be selected among any electrode connected to
the positive input of the AFE. The bias signal can also be configured with the help of a switch and the user
interface. Figure 3 shows the internal and external diagram of this implementation. Bias signal may be
formed from a set of electrodes selected by the user from the GUI and can be connected to the subject with
the bias electrode. Its purpose is to reduce the common-mode interference by creating a negative feedback
loop to the subject, equivalent to the RLD signal in ECG systems. If this is not required, the user can select
the bias signal to be the mid-supply voltage. The external electronics explained above were designed based
on the ADS1299EEG-FE performance demonstration kit, the information of which is available online in
www.ti.com.

positive channel input and SRB1 can be connected to all negative channel inputs. B. When using singleended inputs, through a switch the user can select if the reference is the reference electrode or one of the
channel electrodes connected to SRB2. When operating in differential mode, SRB1 and SRB2 are not
connected to any channel input.

In the case of the USB-Brain system, the user can configure the channels to be differential or singleended. In the single-ended configuration, the reference and the bias signal can be set in the same way as for
the RF-Brain (figures 2 and 3). No analog high-pass filters were implemented, allowing capture of signals
from DC and avoiding possible distortions due to the nonlinearities of the analog filters. Systems were
designed to be used with floating type, cup electrodes with 1.5 mm touch proof connector (DIN 42 802) [21].
2.1.2. Configuration and Control
The configuration and control module consists of a high performance, low power, 8-bit
microcontroller from Atmel® (ATxmega128A4U). It receives the orders from the user and sets the
configuration of the other modules. It also works as a buffer for the data, between the AFE and the
communication modules. The microcontroller works at 32 MHz, and can perform simple processing of the
data. The communication with the other modules is done through serial peripheral interfaces (SPI), whose
baud rate can be modified in the firmware between 1 M bits per second (bps) to 10 Mbps.

A. Internal diagram of the ADS1299 or ADS1298. Channels can be selected for the bias derivation
in the GUI or firmware. In this figure, channels 2 and 3 generate the bias signal, which is then routed to the
negative input of channel 1. B. User can choose the bias signal origin between the generated from the internal
circuitry of the IC or the one at output of the operational amplifier which is the mid-supply voltage.
The general processes made by this module are shown in the flow diagram of Figure 4. For RFBrain and USB-Brain systems the microcontroller is in sleep mode at the beginning and all the other modules
are off to save energy. After an “on-signal” is sent from the user, microcontroller wakes up and turns on all
the other modules. The configuration parameters (like sampling frequency, gain and input multiplexer) are
sent from the host PC. In the case of the Bluetooth-Brain system, the microcontroller is on and the Bluetooth
transceiver is in discovery mode or connected to the receiver at the beginning. Settings must be configured in
the microcontroller firmware by using a programmer device for the microcontroller and a software to load the
code (for example the Atmel® Studio). Firmware of all systems was written in C and can be updated using
the program and debug interface (PDI) port available in all the devices.

2.2. RF-brain
The first system of the family is formed by two boards: the first, a small and light transmitter is
suitable for biofeedback and BCI applications, and is in charge of the acquisition, digitalization and
transmission of data; the second, a USB receiver, is connected to a host computer for display, storage and
processing of the signals. This device is an updated version of the Wireless Neuro Boards presented in [22],
improving 60 Hz/50 Hz noise isolation and providing more flexibility for the electrode configuration.
Improvements were done by modifying all the connectors of the transmitter board and adding some
components for the selection of reference and bias electrode, as explained in the previous section.

2.2.1. Transmitter
The transmitter is a battery powered device formed by four modules: configuration and control,
AFE, wireless RF communication and energy. For the communication, an RF transceiver from Nordic
Semiconductor® was used (nRF24L01+). It operates at the industrial scientific and medical (ISM) band of
2.4 GHz and is capable of reaching an on-air data rate of 2 Mbps, limiting the sampling frequency of the AFE
which can be configured up to 2 k samples per second (SPS), when all channels are active. If only one
channel is active, the sampling frequency can be selected up to 4 kSPS.
The energy module generates a regulated 3.3 V required for all the other components in the board,
from a standard 9 V battery. The maximum current consumption was estimated as 30.21mA at a sampling
frequency of 250 SPS, when all channels are active at programmable gain of 12; providing a battery life of
more than 18 hours when using an alkaline battery of 550 mAh.
The device is a board approximately 60 mm long, 38mm wide and 10 mm high. The weight of the
transmitter is approximately 10 g without the 9 V alkaline battery whose weight is around 45 g. Its weight
makes this device appropriate for humans and animals of 500 g or more.
2.2.2. Receiver
In this device, control and configuration and RF-Communication modules are formed by the same
components used for the transmitter. The USB communication module has a FTDI® FT232H IC, which is a
converter from serial/parallel to Hi-speed USB, allowing transfer of data at baud rates from 115.2 kbps to
1.38 Mbps. The receiver is powered from the USB port of the host computer, with an energy module to offer
regulated 3.3V to all the other modules.
2.3. Bluetooth-brain
Based on the architecture of the RF-Brain system, this portable device was designed to easily
connect with smartphones and tablets through a Bluetooth modem (BlueSMiRF Silver from SparkFun
Electronics®). This modem is capable of transmitting data at a serial stream of 115200 bps, permitting the
system to record EEG signals at 250 SPS. As shown in figure 1, the other modules are similar to those in the
RF-Brain. When using a 9 V alkaline battery of 550 mAh, the system may work continuously for
approximately 7 hours (8 channels active with programmable gain of 12). It is required for the receiver
device to have Bluetooth connectivity (Bluetooth v2.0 or higher). Some embedded devices need a Bluetooth
dongle to achieve this connectivity. For storage, visualization and processing of data, a GUI for Android
devices was specially designed. MATLAB® GUI was also designed for the cases where the receiver is a
Windows® laptop or PC. Basic functions are available: selection of channels of acquisition, visualization of
signals and storage options.
2.4. USB-brain
This system was designed for experimentation where high sampling frequency is required and offers
more options for electrode configuration and external hardware synchronization. Communication is made
directly through the USB port of the host PC using a FTDI® serial/parallel to USB converter. Since the data
do not need to be wirelessly transmitted, the sampling frequency can be set from 250 SPS to 4 kSPS.
The processing module uses the ATxmega128A4U microcontroller from Atmel® and a 32 KB
SRAM chip was integrated for loading of files (for example, stimulation sequences when used to acquire
evoked potentials) into the system. 8 general purpose input/output pins are available and can be used for
different tasks such as synchronization with external hardware (for example, stimuli delivery) or interactions
with the subject during the tests.
USB-Brain is powered through the USB port of the host computer. The power module delivers three
voltage levels from the 5 V of a standard USB port: ± 2.5 V for the AFE and other analog modules, and 3.3 V
for all the digital components. It also provides an isolation of 3 kVDC from a DC/DC converter (Texas
Instruments® DCH010505D) to ensure the safety of the subject under test. Transfer of data is also isolated
through a digital coupler (Texas Instruments® ISO150) to avoid any current flow from the PC or laptop to
the subject.
Total current consumption of the system during normal operation is approximately 117 mA at a
sampling frequency of 250 SPS and a channel programmable gain of 12, with all channels active in
differential mode. The dimensions of the main board of the system are: 91 mm wide by 112 mm long by 10
mm height, and its weight is 100 g.
2.5. Configuration and Acquisition Interfaces
GUIs were implemented in MATLAB® for all the systems in the family when using a PC or laptop.
From the GUIs, the user can select the channel configuration, sampling frequency and the options of storage

and visualization of the data. The options vary depending on the system. Figure 5 shows the GUI for the
USB-Brain system. For the RF-Brain and USB-Brain, in the current GUIs, the following options are
available:
a. Short Circuit: All inputs shorted. For the RF-Brain all inputs connected internally to the reference
electrode. For the USB-Brain, the inputs are connected either positive input with negative input or
positive input to reference electrode, depending on the electrode configuration. These settings provide a
way to measure noise levels in the system.
b. Test Signal: When activated, an auto-generated square signal from the AFE, with amplitude of 1 mV
and a frequency of 1 Hz approximately, is generated and helps to verify the correct acquisition and
communication link in the case of the RF-Brain.
c. Normal: The normal operation of the channels for EEG acquisition.
For Bluetooth-Brain, these options can be modified from the firmware of the system. Table 2 shows
the available options for all the devices. Additionally, for the Bluetooth-Brain, an Android GUI was designed
where the user can select channels to visualize the data and store the signals into a file for further off-line
processing.

2.6. Modularity
All systems were designed to be modular with the purpose of making changes easily when the
experimentation requires it. For this reason it was possible to make a whole family of systems by changing
some modules in the design. Other possible modifications from the core of the family may include, for
instance, the addition of more AFEs to increase the channel number, through a daisy-chain connection,
avoiding the use of more pins in the microcontroller; for this modification the SPI communication baud rate
and the sample rate must be taken into account: for a sample rate of 1 kSPS and a SPI communication at 1
MHz, 5 AFEs (with 8 channels each one) can be daisy-chained for a total number of 40 channels.
The communication module can be replaced in all systems, for example when other type of
communication is required (wired or wireless). As long as an SPI communication protocol can be used, no
major changes must be done in the firmware of the devices. When access to firmware is required, a PDI port
is available in all the systems to change the firmware of the microcontroller and the basic configuration of the
AFE.

TESTS AND RESULTS
All systems have different features; Table 2 summarizes the main characteristics of the family. The
following aspects were tested for each system: power consumption, communication reliability (for the case of
wireless devices) at all possible sampling rates, electric noise and acquisition of test signals. Pilot tests were
done with human subjects to record EEG signals. During the tests the environment was not controlled,
meaning that Wi-Fi signals and mobile cell phones were present in the area of tests.

3.1. Power Consumption
Power consumption was measured in all systems at standby and regular operation. The standby
condition implies, for the RF-Brain and the USB-Brain, that the microcontroller is in sleep mode and all the
other modules are off. For this condition, maximum power consumption of the devices were 2.64 mA and
77.7 mA for the RF-Brain and the USB-Brain respectively. Power module and extra components in the USBBrain system are responsible for its higher current consumption compared to the RF-Brain. In the case of the
Bluetooth-Brain, the standby conditions means that the microcontroller is on and the Bluetooth transceiver is
either in discovery mode or connected to the receiver device, but no data is transmitted. Its current
consumption is 66.7 mA.
In the case of regular operation, all channels in the systems were active in normal configuration,
with a gain of 12 and a sampling frequency of 250SPS. For the RF-Brain, the maximum power consumption
was 30.21 mA; the Bluetooth-Brain has a maximum power consumption of 76.7 mA and the USB-Brain
consumes at most 117.1 mA.
3.2. Communication Range and Reliability
To test the communication range and reliability, a periodic saw-tooth signal was synthetically
generated in the microcontroller and sent to the host computer or receiver for a minimum period of 10
minutes. All systems were tested at the complete set of the sampling frequencies. USB-Brain system
communication did not present any data corruption or loss for all the sampling frequencies. Tests were also
performed for the two wireless systems, changing the distance between the receiver and the transmitter. No
data loss or corruption was presented for a distance of 5 m or less from the receiver.
3.3. Noise Measurement
A noise test took place for a set of sampling frequencies. The test consisted of shorting the inputs of
the amplifiers through the input multiplexer settings and acquiring the signals. Noise measurements were
made for 1000 continuous readings. Average results of all channels are detailed in Table 3.

3.4. Test Signal
To assess the integrity of the PGAs, its adequate calibration and visualization capability of the
graphic interface, a test signal was acquired through all the channels of the three systems, at different gain
settings. The test signal is an internally generated (generated inside the AFE ICs), square wave of 1 mV of
amplitude and 1 Hz of frequency. An example of the acquired test signal is shown in Figure 6. Test signal
acquired with the bluetooth-brain. Test signal is internally generated by the IC in the AFE module and
consists on a squared wave of 1mV of amplitude and 1Hz of frequency

Figure 6. Test signal acquired with the bluetooth-brain

3.5. Pilot Tests
To evaluate the quality of the acquired physiological signals, a variety of tests were made for each
system. All physiological signals were acquired from healthy human subjects who gave consent for the use of
the data. Electrode location follows the standard ten-twenty electrode system [23], [24]. All procedures
explained in this section were approved by the Research Ethical Committee of Universidad de los
Andes–Bogotá–Colombia, or the Institutional Review Board of the University of Miami–Florida–United
States, in fulfillment of the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association. The following tests were done:
RF-Brain: auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were acquired with the RF-Brain system from one
subject (S1, 27 years old) using a data rate of 500 SPS and a gain of 12 in the PGAs. The experimental setup
consisted on an electrode located in Cz and referred to A1 for ipsilateral acquisition. Bias signal was selected
at mid-supply voltage and located also at A1. The stimulus used was monaural rarefaction clicks at 60 dB
nHL at a frequency of 6 stimuli per second. Etymotic Research ER3 insert earphones were used. We wanted
to assess the performance of the RF-Brain by comparing the signals acquired against signals from a
commercial system; for this purpose we used the Intelligent Hearing Systems (IHS) Universal Smart Box at a
sampling frequency of 500 SPS and a gain of 100000 (high-pass filter at 1Hz and low-pass filter at 1500 Hz).
A total of 720 sweeps were recorded and averaged to extract the evoked potential. Figure 7 shows the results
for the RF-Brain and the commercial system. The typical shape of an AEP (middle latency response) can be
observed: two positive waves (marked as Pa and Pb), and two negative waves (Na and Nb) [25]. A difference
in the amplitude of the signals is observed and may be due to the use of filters in the IHS system. Latencies
and morphology of the signals are similar, taking into account the number of sweeps used for the
computation of the potentials (see [3]).
Additionally, EEG signals were registered from another subject (S2, male 27 years old), with one
electrode located at Oz and referred to Fpz. Sampling rates of 500 SPS and 1 kSPS were used at a gain of 12.
Alpha waves were observed for the periods of time where the subject had his eyes closed [21].
Bluetooth-Brain and USB-Brain: Following a similar procedure than for the RF-Brain, EEG signals
were acquired with the Bluetooth-Brain and the USB-Brain, from two human subjects (S3, male, 22 years old
and S4, male, 29 years old) using an electrode in Oz referred to Fpz, for a sampling rate of 250 SPS and a
gain of 12 in the case of the Bluetooth-Brain. For the USB-Brain, sampling frequencies of 2 kSPS and 4
kSPS were used for a gain of 24 in the PGAs. An example of these acquired signals is shown in Figure 8,

where a time-frequency representation is also depicted to view main frequency components. Alpha waves
can be observed when the subject closes his eyes at approximately 10 Hz.
Figure 7 shows auditory evoked potentials acquired with RF-brain system and the IHS universal
smart box. 720 sweeps were averaged to obtain the evoked potentials. main waves of a typical AEP are
observed and marked as “Na”, “Pa”, “Nb” and “Pb”. A small difference in the amplitude can be observed,
but latencies and morphology of the signals are similar. Figure 8 shows EEG signal acquired with the
bluetooth-brain for subject S3 along with its time-frequency spectrogram to show its main frequency
components. Electrodes were located in Oz with reference and bias in Fpz. alpha waves (at 10 Hz
approximately) can be observed after the subject closes his eyes

DISCUSSION
Three modular, flexible, affordable and high-performance systems were described in detail in this
paper. All members of the family of systems have a common core composed by an AFE and a control and
configuration module. Two wireless systems were designed for BCI and biofeedback applications where
movement of the subjects is not restricted: RF-Brain and Bluetooth-Brain. Since these two systems are
battery powered instead of being connected to the line power, the safety of the subject under test is assured.
Bluetooth-Brain offers the possibility of connecting the system to a mobile device like a tablet or smartphone. The third, a wired system, offers options for experimentation where high sampling rates,
synchronization and general purpose ports are needed. Flexibility is the result of the modular and open nature
of the devices, which allows the selection of main features through GUIs and firmware upgrades for the
control and configuration module.Access to all systems information, including schematics and C code of the
microcontroller can be provided after contacting the authors.
A variety of tests were made to assess the performance of the family, including power consumption,
range and integrity of communication link, synthetic signals and a pilot test with electrophysiological signals.
Results have been positive, showing a performance similar or better to other systems like the ones presented
in [26]–[29]. A comparison between the Brain family and other systems is shown in Table 4.
Although some commercial systems, like Cognionics 32-channel headset, have a greater number of
channels [27], brain family has a higher sampling frequency and the same bit resolution. In fact, compared
with any other system listed in table 4, brain family devices may be set at a higher sampling frequency.
Another aspect to mention is their autonomy: while other systems are capable of working continuously for up
to 5 hours, brain family systems can work for more than 18 hours with a standard 9V alkaline battery.
Costs of manufacturing the systems are lower than the price of devices like the Emotiv Epoc
(https://emotiv.com/epoc.php) or the ABM B-Alert X10 (http://www.advancedbrainmonitoring.com/),
accomplishing one of the main goals of the implementation of the brain family, which was to offer high
performance devices at a lower price.
One factor to be accounted for the brain family systems is the electrode positioning, which must be
done manually with wet electrodes. This may require more time at the beginning of experimentation than

when using other devices for which the electrodes are located in a structure with pre-defined locations.
However, some locations or structures of electrodes are not suitable for all head sizes and for the cases where
dry electrodes are used, the pressure required for the fixation of the sensors generates discomfort in the
subjects [13]. This is avoided with the gel electrodes. Also, the lack of a pre-defined structure allows the
adaptation for any head size or the use of non-standard locations of electrodes.

CONCLUSION
A group of affordable and flexible EEG acquisition systems was described in detail in this paper. To
assess the performance of the devices, a variety of tests took place. The results for all systems with synthetic
test signals and electrophysiological signals showed that the devices are suitable tools for research areas
involving EEG signals.
The cost of the devices (less than 500 USD each one) marks an important advantage over
commercial systems. However, the manufacturing process may be time consuming and require a thorough
knowledge of electronics. For the wireless devices, further improvements in the systems may include the use
of an internal and rechargeable battery, even though the use of an external, alkaline battery provides enough
autonomy for most of the experiments.
Modularity of the systems enables the researcher to independently manage the acquisition,
processing and transmission of the signals to a host computer. This fragmentation allows the researcher to
make decisions about the settings required, in accordance with the restrictions imposed by the
experimentation protocol in relation to the mobility of the subject, sampling frequency, gain and
configuration of the electrodes. As a future project, with further modifications to the core of the devices, the
authors want to provide a main board to which daughter boards can be attached, depending on the specific
requirements of the experimentation in communication mode (wireless or wired), availability of
synchronization ports, general purpose inputs or outputs and memory modules, among others.
