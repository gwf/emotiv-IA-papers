ABSTRACT The goal of this research is to integrate Virtual Reality (VR) with the bilateral stimulation
used in EMDR as a tool to relieve stress. We created a 15 minutes relaxation training program for adults in a
virtual, relaxing environment in form of a walk in the woods. The target platform for the tool is HTC Vive,
however it can be easily ported to other VR platforms. An integral part of this tool is a set of sensors, which
serves as physiological measures to evaluate the effectiveness of such system. What is more, the system
integrate visual (passing sphere), auditory (surround sound) and tactile signals (vibration of controllers). A
pilot treatment programme, incorporating the above mentioned VR system, was carried out. Experimental
group consisting of 28 healthy adult volunteers (office workers), participated in three different sessions of
relaxation training. Before starting, baseline features such as subjectively perceived stress, mood, heart rate,
galvanic skin response and muscle response were registered. The monitoring of physiological indicators
is continued during the training session and one minute after its completion. Before and after the session,
volunteers were asked to re-fill questionnaires regarding the current stress level and mood. The obtained
results were analyzed in terms of variability over time: before, during and after the session.

I. INTRODUCTION

The first concept of stress, introduced by Hans Selye, defined
it as a non-specific response of the body to any demand,
which can occur in humans, animals, and even plants and
bacteria [1]. In his further work [2] Selye claimed that stress
is an inseparable part of human daily life because it is associated with different types of issues people struggle with such
as surgical trauma, burns, emotional arousal, mental or physical effort, fatigue, pain, fear, the need for concentration, the
humiliation of frustration, the loss of blood, intoxication with
drugs or environmental pollutants. This phenomenon can also
accompanying life changing positive events as basically it
can be considered as the mobilisation reaction of the organism to external (being fired or promoted) and internal (worrying about the loss of job or waiting for the promotion) threats
and challenges [3]. During stress reaction nervous system
releases stress hormones such as adrenaline, noradrenaline
and cortisol. The heart begins to beat faster, muscles tighten,
blood pressure rises, breath quickens, senses become sharper.

These physical changes increase strength and stamina, speed
up reaction time, and enhance focus, preparing for confrontation [4]. Unfortunately, the stress reaction is nonspecific
- any stimuli which affects homeostasis of the organism
has the potential of starting it and prepare the body to the
extensive energy expenditure which was needed to fight the
predator or escape from danger. The modern man faces other
challenges mostly of economical, and psycho-social nature,
and such intense physical mobilisation of all the organism
is not needed when facing everyday stressors. However, this
evolutionary developed mechanism still works. When stress
reaction is too intense or happens too often giving body
no chance to calm down, many adverse effects can appear.
Hundred years of research leaves no doubts - chronic and/or
intense stress causes mental and physical health problems
such as mental disorders ( e.g. depression, anxiety, PTSD,
substance abuse), cardiovascular, muscosceletal disorders,
negatively affect immune system, fertility and produces many
others minor symptoms [5]. What is more, it contributes to

many disabilities worldwide and represents a severe economic burden [6]. The annual stress survey conducted by
the American Institute of Stress reported that average stress
levels in the United States rose from 4.9 to 5.1 on a scale
from 1 to 10 in 2015. The main reasons given are employment and money [7]. Recently, World Health Organization
(WHO) has named stress as the "Health Epidemic of the 21st
Century" [3]. A first line treatment of excessive stress and its
consequences is psychotherapy, which can be accompanied
by bilateral stimulation for example in EMDR therapy.
Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing
(EMDR) is one of the psycho-therapeutic approaches widely
recognized as an empirically supported treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [8]–[10]. The application of EMDR has expanded rapidly beyond PTSD and it
has high, evidence-based efficacy in treating other mental
disorders such as: phobia [11], [12], panic disorder [13],
[14], generalized anxiety disorder [15] and depression [16],
[17]. The method is predicated on the assumption that
psychopathology is caused by memories, which were not processed or were processed incorrectly in the past. Disturbing
memories (coded in the brain as the images, emotions and
thoughts/cognition) may fade or be suppressed, but as they
remain in memory as the network of associations, they are
easily reactivated by various internal and external stimuli,
manifest as maladaptive responses and, in long-term, as
mental or somatic disorders. EMDR uses bilateral stimulation (BLS) (eye movements, tones, taps and vibrations)
to ease the access to unprocessed or incorrectly processed
memories. BLS enables a patient to start processing these
memories so that they become less disturbing, stressful or
traumatic. BLS is the key element of the therapeutic process
in the EMDR. Bilateral stimulation is also used in EMDR
to bring the patient into calm and relaxing state [18]. BLS
has been recently supported with electronic devices that
generate a light signal moving in the field of view, sounds
and vibrations/pulsations (see Fig. 1). Thus, we believe
that Virtual Reality (VR) technology, which allows for the
variety of stimuli facilitating BLS, may have a promising
contribution in EMDR therapy.
Virtual Reality is a technology that simulates user’s physical presence in an artificially generated world and allows
to interact dynamically with the environment. Most of VR
applications and solutions focus on gaming and commercial industries, as these areas provide the largest groups of
VR headsets recipients. However, possibilities of VR do
not end with gaming. Dynamic growth and interest in the
subject rendered it applicable in many other areas, such as
military [23], psychology [24], medicine [25] and teaching
applications [26]–[28]. What is more, recent studies have
shown that VR may redefine psychological treatment by
creating an environment which will help patients to cope with
experiences that are a source of mental crises [24]. From the
review of research using VR in the therapy of mental disorders, it appears that this type of technology may be conducive
to alleviating the symptoms of depression and anxiety disor-

der [29]–[31]. What is more, VR allows for employment of
multisensor stimulation which helps patients to discover the
background experiences which feed their current symptoms,
and support the process of resource installation. Thus, we
believe that VR can facilitate the therapeutic process thanks
to interactive scenarios which can be designed to address
such symptoms as negative thinking, negative self-image,
sleep problems, tension, powerlessness etc. In this study, we
implemented bilateral stimulation and exercise based on safe
place protocol of EMDR into VR to enhance the processing
of relaxing stimuli and provide the background for adaptive
coping. According to our best knowledge, such an approach
has not yet been developed and tested.
In this paper, we propose automated therapy tool in form of
a VR system, comprised of an interactive virtual reality (VR)
simulation, based on scenarios created for psychotherapy
treatment, together with a set of sensors to monitor patient’s
psychophysical condition. To measure the success rate of the
tool, randomised trials have been conducted on experimental
group of 28 healthy adult volunteers (office workers), participating in three different sessions of relaxation training. Patients’ activities such as heart rate, galvanic skin response and
electromyography of trapezius were continuously monitored
by the system. Additionally, before and after session, volunteers were asked to fill in questionnaires regarding the current
stress level and mood. Initial results are very promising and
randomised clinical trials on ambulatory patients diagnosed
with distress, anxiety, PTSD, depression and stress-induced
disorders should be strongly considered.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II

stress recognition methods. In the Section III the details of
the proposed method are described followed by the experi-

II. RELATED RESEARCH

This section first reviews main tools based on bilateral
stimulation, and then approaches to stress recognition using
physiological signals.
A. TECHNIQUES FOR STRESS AND ANXIETY
REDUCTION

Nowadays stress is considered as the second health problem
affecting people in developed countries, and many efforts
are put in searching for effective methods to reduce it at
individual and macro level (WHO, 2011). As stress has been
accompanying people since their beginning, humans have
developed variety of strategies and approaches to cope with
it. The methods differs depending on the sources of stress,
its durability, culture and historical time. Some of proposed
way of stress reduction are short lived others established
their position in clinical and everyday life. To give the short
description of the most acknowledged methods we refer
to research on them. The presentation of techniques is the
subjective choice of authors address the criteria of evidencebased treatment and scope of application of given method.
Autogenic training (AT) – the core exercises were described in 1932 by the neuropsychiatrists Johannes Schultz.
The method was developed with the help of Wolfgang
Luthe [32]. The authors were inspired by yoga and zen
practice. AT is a structured meditative set of exercises which
allow to obtain the mind-body balance and relaxation [33].
Six standard exercises are based on imaginary and verbal
self-cues to make body heavy, warm and relaxed. Effectiveness of AT is related to experience in practicing and
personal involvement. Recent studies found the use of this
technique in various categories of health problems – from
everyday tension, headaches, ADHD, psychiatric disorders
(anxiety, depression, bulimia nervosa) to stress causing lifethreatening illness [32], [33]. Meta-analyses of studies on
effectiveness of Autogenic Training showed that AT had
medium to high effects on the main clinical outcomes in comparison with untreated control conditions, moreover these
effects are stable in time [34]–[36].
Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) - a method developed by Edmund Jacobsen based on the observation that
relaxed muscles improve the mood of a person Jacobsen’s
progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) [37] is a procedure for
achieving a deep relaxation of the body through the voluntary
and conscious tensing and relaxing of muscle groups. While
exercising an individual tenses muscle groups in a specific
order, the muscle tension is held for a brief time and then
released. Jacobsen proposed 16 muscle groups to exercise
with but latter Bernstein & Borkovec reduced that number
to 6-7 muscle groups with the same effect of the programme
effectiveness [37]. According to recent studies and metaanalyses PMR is an effective method of tension reduction. It
is widely used as a technique supporting psychotherapy, med-

ical treatment of various conditions [38] and occupational
stress prevention tool [34], [36]. It was proven that long term
effect of PMR includes: decrease of salivary cortisol level,
blood pressure and heart rate and reduction of anxiety [32].
Biofeedback - is the method employed sensitive electronic
instrument which provide information about body functioning. This information is used to develop greater awareness
and control over the body processes and enhances selfregulation processes which help individuals do obtain the
state of balance/ homeostasis [39]. There different kind of
indices that can be used in biofeedback including: breathing,
heart rate, muscle tension, skin temperature, brain waves etc.
Biofeedback is provided at the presence of a biofeedback
therapist who teaches a person how to interpret body signals
and how to influence them to gain the positive state of relaxation (for a review see [40]). Biofeedback is successfully
used in controlling alleviated blood pressure, reduction of
headaches and also helps in combating everyday stress [41],
[42].
Diaphragmatic breathing - a technique which employ diaphragm muscle to enhance the effectiveness of breathing.
It is seemed to an efficient integrative body–mind training
for dealing with stress and psychosomatic conditions There
are numerous studies which have shown that diaphragmatic
breathing facilitate relaxation response of the body [43]. It
was successfully applied to reduce depression, anxiety and
stress [44]–[47].
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)- a technique based on the work of Kabat -Zinn [48], [49]. He
developed the mindfulness based training program for people
suffering from chronic pain and emotional problems in 1982.
The MBSR intervention is designed to make participants to
be more aware of, and relate differently to thoughts, feelings,
and body sensations which are experienced right now. The
important characteristic of mindfulness is the non-judging
observation of any stimuli which appears in the scope of
human awareness. Studies revealed that MBRS is effective
in treatment of elevated stress [50].
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) – the psychotherapy
developed by A. T. Beck in 60. of XX based on the assumption that the way we think influence well-being. Restructuring dis-functional cognitive schemata followed by
behavioural changes appeared to be essential in the process
of symptoms reduction. This is a highly structured, time
restricted form of psychotherapy. The effectiveness of CBT
was proven in the great number of studies. The strongest
support for CBT efficacy was obtained for treatment of anxiety disorder, somatoform disorders, bulimia, anger control
problems, and general stress [51].
Eye movement desentization and reprocessing (EMDR)
– as it was mentioned earlier, EMDR is a relatively young
mode of psychotherapy with many studies on its usefulness
for different health conditions [20], [46], [52]–[54] The
theoretical framework for EMDR is Adaptive Information
Processing model (AIP). The model assumes that recovering
past negative information and processing them to be included

in a new cognitive and emotional network reduces negative
symptoms related to the past experiences. Recently EMDR
has been successfully used for reduction of stress and anxiety
both in adults [52], [55] and children and adolescents [56],
[57].
Recently VR has been implemented in treatment of anxiety
and stress. Virtual reality replaced in vivo exposure or imaginary exposure in the treatment modes based on the concept
of desensitization. Thus one of the first attempts was implementation of VR in the treatment of Post-traumatic stress and
anxiety disorders (mainly simple phobias). After the years
of research this approach was proven to be effective [58],
[59]. The evidence based efficacy of VR based treatments
has encouraged health professionals and scientists to develop
VR based programs aimed for stress reduction in various
occupational settings. The example of such implementation
is stress management training for military [60]. There is also
increasing evidence that treatments employing VR are effective in improving well being and quality of life in various
populations – from healthy people under stress conditions,
depression sufferers to cancer patients.
B. STRESS RECOGNITION USING PHYSIOLOGICAL
DATA

Currently stress is one of the major issues in modern society,
thus its detection has become a challenging task in computer science and affective computing [61]. Monitoring stress
technology, which can objectively measure psychological
state of an individual, may allow people to better understand
their psycho-physical condition and improve the outcomes of
psychotherapy [62]. The literature regarding stress detection
is extensive, and very often constitutes a part of emotion
recognition process, since stress can be reflected through
subject’s emotional state or mood such as frustration, anger,
agitation, preoccupation, fear, anxiety, and tenseness [63].
As in case of emotion recognition, it is mainly based on
facial [63], [64], speech [65], [66] and gestures [67]–[69]
signals analysis. The undoubted benefit of this approach
is the possibility of interpreting the through less or nonintrusive methods which do not require physical contact [63].
Physiological signal acquisition is closely related to a different type of sensors and requires them to be calibrated
and placed on specific locations of the body, which can be
inconvenient [70]. However, there are evident stress-related
signs, which are reflected through variation of blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, skin conductance, cortisol
or pupil diameter [62]. Thus, physiological measuring is
becoming an increasingly popular approach.
The crucial part of this study is VR based EMDR relaxation technique, which requires the participants to wear
Head-Mounted Display (HMD) and not to move their head
during the session. These assumptions cause limitations in
possibilities of automatic stress recognition: the main part of
the face is covered by VR headset and participants do not
speak or move. Thus, facial expressions, speech signal and
gestures can not be taken into consideration. However, the

stable position and immobility of the subject favor the use
of sensors, which is why we use GSR, EMG and HRM for
monitoring. Therefore, in this section, we cover the recent
advancements in automatic stress recognition from physiological signals. An overview of sensors commonly used for
assessing the user’s stress level is presented in Tab. 1. The
reader interested in stress recognition from facial expressions, gestures or speech is encouraged to consult dedicated
articles and surveys [70]–[76].
One of the most effective affect-recognition methods is
based on brain waves analysis, thus electroencephalogram
has been widely applied to assess individuals’ stress in laboratory conditions. For example in [82] the authors present an
investigation on the feasibility of exploiting EEG signals to
distinguish different stress levels. They propose a protocol
where the stress level is represented by the complexity of
mental arithmetic task (at three levels of difficulty), and
the stressors are time pressure and negative feedback. The
analysis of EEG responses in controlled and stress conditions
gathered among 18-male subjects allowed them to extract
patterns of brainwaves for different stress levels. Using multiclass SVM with error-correcting output code they obtained an
average classification accuracy of 94.79%.
Certainly one of the most important disadvantages of
EEG is its setup. It requires a precise placement of several
electrodes along the scalp (very often in a form of cap)
and the use of gels or saline solutions. Thus this kind of
experiments are mainly conducted in a controlled laboratory
environment [83]. However, recently a few manufacturers
have miniaturized medical EEG technology and created lowcost, wireless and wearable EEG devices. This kind of solution is used in [84], where the authors propose a procedure
to automatically recognize stress of construction workers
while they were working on site. They analysed time and
frequency domain features from EEG signal captured by a
wearable EEG device (Emotiv EPOC) and applied several
different supervised learning algorithms, obtaining the highest classification accuracy of 80.32 % using the Gaussian
Support Vector Machine. These results are very promising,
since similar results were obtained in laboratory conditions.
In most studies a set of sensors, sometimes in the form of a
wearable system, is used for stress or emotional state recognition [85]–[87]. For example in [79] the authors present an automated system for emotional state detection (high stress, low
stress, disappointment, and euphoria) of car-racing drivers
based on features extracted from facial electromyograms
(EMGs), ECG, RIP, and EDA. Support vector machines
and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system were used for
classification. The system was validated on ten subjects in
simulated racing conditions, giving the classification rates of
79.3% and 76.7% for SVM and ANFIS respectively. Similar
approach is presented in [88], where the authors introduced
a wearable sensor platform, combining HRM, RIP, EDA
and EMG to monitor a number of physiological correlates
of mental stress. Subsequently they propose new spectral
features that estimate the balance of the autonomic nervous

Description / stress indicator
EEG is a method to monitor electrical activity of the brain. The relationship between brain
activity and stress was repeatedly proven. For example, it has been found that females with
PTSD have an increased activation in the anterior and middle insula when they are recalling
previous stressful events [70]. However, this method may be inconvenient since electrodes are
placed along the scalp.
EMG is a technique used to measure electrical potential produced by skeletal muscles. For
example, muscle activity has been shown to increase during stress. These signal is measured
by bio sensors located on face (e.g. zygomaticus major) [77], shoulder or upper trapezius
muscle [78].
Electrocardiography is a process which monitors the electrical activity of the heart (voltage
versus time). ECG is used to calculate the rate and regularity of heartbeats. The sensor can be
located above the chest or limbs. Heart-rate acceleration is generally associated with stress and
nervousness, while lower heart-rate reflects relaxation or reaction to pleasant stimuli [79].
EDA measures the conductivity of the skin. One of the main indicators of stress is sweating,
which results in EDR increase. Since this signal is strongly influenced by external factors
(outside temperature), it requires calibration before measurement [80].
RIP measures the respiration patterns such as respiration rate and volume. The sensor is
usually in the form of a strap, which may be placed on chest or abdomen. It is proved that
faster and deeper respiration is associated with arousal, whereas rest and relaxation with
slower and shallower respiration. Thus, a state of stress is usually indicated by more frequent
respiration [79].
Skin temperature can be measured using a standard resistance thermometer as well as using
infrared thermopile or camera [81]. It was shown that during fight-or-flight response the blood
flow to the extremities is restricted in favor of the vital organs, which causes a decrease in
temperature in the extremities [61].

system by combining information from the power spectral
density of respiration and heart rate variability. The effectiveness of proposed features set was evaluated on binary
discrimination problem (mental stress or relaxation) using
logistic regression model. The overall recognition rate was
81% across subjects.
Research presented in [78] investigated physiological signals such as electrocardiogram, skin conductivity and respiration changes, as reliable channels for emotion recognition.
The authors collected physiological data set from multiple
subjects by a musical induction method. Basing a wide range
of physiological features, classification of four emotional
states (positive/high arousal, negative/high arousal, negative/low arousal, and positive/low arousal) was performed
using an extended linear discriminant analysis, which was
juxtaposed with an original scheme of emotion-specific multilevel dichotomous classification. Implementation of proposed classification scheme resulted in an improvement in
recognition accuracy.
Lewandowska [89] addressed the issue of physiological measurements being disturbed by a motion typical for
human-computer interaction such as keyboard typing or
mouse movements. Several different locations of sensors
(skin conductance, blood volume pulse and temperature sensors) were evaluated for relevance and measurement precision. The analysis provided alternative locations showing
correlation with the original ones, but with lower sensitivity
to movements like typing or operating a mouse.
Another approach is presented in [81], where the authors

proposed a methodology for monitoring the affective states
of computer users based on thermal imaging of the face.
They proved that state of stress is strongly associated with
increased blood flow in the frontal vessel of the forehead,
which can be monitored through thermal imaging. The
method was evaluated on 12 subjects, and the results were
juxtaposed with real-time measurements of energy expenditure using invasive cardiopulmonary device. They proved that
proposed method is highly correlated with the EE methodology.
Garcia et. al [90] consider the use of smartphones to monitor stress levels in real working environments basing on data
from smartphone’s built-in accelerometer. Thirty subjects,
recruited from two different organizations, participated in 8
week study. The perceived stress level was reported three
times during working hours using self-assessment questionnaire by each participant. Based solely on data from an
accelerometer and using combination of statistical models to
classify self reported stress levels, they achieved a maximum
overall accuracy of 71% for user-specific models, which is
comparable to the state of the art results in stress recognition based on more sophisticated sensors. More extensive
research is presented in [62], where 5-day physiological and
behavioral data including wrist sensor output (skin conductance and accelerometer), mobile phone usage (call, short
message service, location and screen on/off) and surveys
(stress, mood, sleep, tiredness, general health, alcohol or
caffeinated beverage intake and electronics usage) from 18
subjects was analysed to find physiological or behavioral

stress markers. Obtained results showed over 75% accuracy
of perceived low and high stress level using the combination
of the above mentioned data. What is more, they proved that
the patterns associated with the activity level (such as SMS
and screen on/off) are the most correlated with the stress
level.
Although VR technology is increasingly being used in
psychology to generate stimuli for mental health research and
therapy, in the literature there is very little research examining changes in affective reactions of VR users. Most of them
use questionnaires which are then analyzed in details [91],
however they remain based on subjective assessment. Only
a few works use objective measurements from sensors for
analysis. For example, Dongrae et al. [92] analysed a photoplethysmogram, electrodermal activity, heart-rate variability,
skin conductance and temperature of twelve healthy participants performing mental tasks using VR to monitor stress.
They applied a kernel-based extreme-learning machine to
classify five different levels of stress situations: baseline,
mild stress, moderate stress, severe stress, and recovery. The
average classification accuracy was about 95% using K-ELM
and features extracted from physiological signals. Similar
approach is presented in [93], where the authors describe a
Decision Support System (DSS) for automatic classification
of stress levels during exposure to VR environments. Proposed system integrates ECG, RIP and EEG sensors as well
as behavioral data (body gestures tracking with Kinect). Selfrated and clinical-rated stress levels were used as a ground
truth. During the session, detected stress level (ranging from
0 to 1) is reported to the therapist and graphically displayed
on a diagram, which can be accessed via web interface.
However, it should be noted that in this case virtual reality
is understood by the authors as an environment displayed on
the monitor screen, not in HMDs.
III. METHODOLOGY
A. VR APPLICATION

The virtual environment was developed using Unity - Game
Engine and C# programming language in the form of two
scenes (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). The first scene has primarily configuration purpose and allows for adjustment of the
patient’s location and virtual camera as well as general familiarization with the experience offered by HMD’s. During
the session, each participant should relax on a comfortable
bean bag in a chosen position. Because of the differences
in overall body structure and preferences (sitting position,
semi-recumbent position etc.), in the first step the scene
is calibrated to make sure that the main element of the
scene is centered vertically and horizontally for a particular
participant.
Simulated motions can affect one’s perception of time
and space and thus induce dizziness and nausea. This phenomenon is called VR sickness or cybersickness [94] and various research suggested the use of adaptation and if needed,
anti-motion sickness drugs to reduce this kind of side-

effects [95]. Thus, the second scene starts with adaptation
session (a walk in the forest without bilateral stimulation).
The rest of the second scene has a solely therapeutic
purpose. The VR environment is composed of the forest
scenery enriched by a delicate, instrumental theme with the
sounds of chirping birds. The exercise involves following
the golden sphere, which is moving horizontally. The sphere
moves constantly in the subject’s field of view, and a properly
performed exercise denies the possibility of head movements.
The therapeutic session may be run in one of four operating
modes (see Tab. 4).
A single session begins with the introductory part, which
gives additional time for minor corrections and getting acquainted with the principles of performed exercises. The core
part follows, combining six 63-second sets. Subsequent sets
are conducted in various forest scenes. Possible stress related
to a sudden change of the virtual location is minimized using
graphical screen blur. During the whole session, selected
biomedical parameters and head motor activity (for 6 degrees
of freedom) of the examined volunteers were recorded (see
Sec. III-B). The application is incorporated directly with an
electronic questionnaire system (pre- and post-questionnaire)
to maintain the consistency of the measurement data with
the questionnaire’s results. The application is available to
academic community upon request.
B. BIOSENSORS

For the purpose of this research physiological signals were
acquired using GSR, EMG and HRM sensors, which are
briefly described in the following section. The position of
biosensors and the typical wave-forms are illustrated in
Fig. 4.
1) Galvanic Skin Response

Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) (skin conductance) is a measure of the continuous variations in electrical resistance of
the skin. It depends on the degree of skin hydration caused
by the variation of sweat glands activity controlled by the
sympathetic nervous system. The most common model of
GSR reaction assumes that the reduction of skin resistance
occurs as a result of sweating and filling of sweat glands.
Measurement of GSR is based on the assumption that the
level of stimulation of the cerebral cortex and skin resistance
are correlated: stimulation of the cerebral cortex is reflected
in a decrease in skin resistance, and a decrease in the level of
stimulation is associated with an increase in skin resistance.
Thus, GSR is influenced by a psychological condition. Usually, the measured value is skin resistance or its inverse - conductance (G = 1/R)). The measurement process is relatively
simple: the sensor, in the form of two dry electrodes, is placed
on two fingers (see Fig. 4). In case of this research, especially
during sessions type 3 and 4, the haptic feedback may affect
the measurement and be inconvenient for the subject holding
controllers. Additionally, another limitation is the need to
maintain appropriate temperature conditions inside the room.
In the case of high temperatures, a small resistance associated

attached to the skin above the trapezius muscle. An electromyograph detects the electric potential generated when the
muscle cells are activated [61]. The purpose of this research
is to track neurological activation of muscles (muscle tension
under stress), however even a small head movement affects
the measurement and average results. Thus, the signal should
be denoised by simultaneous observation from ACC and
gyroscope information. Additionally, it is very difficult to
determine the appropriate sensitivity of the device for a given
subject, because it depends on individual’s muscle structure.
3) Heart Rate Monitoring

with sweat on the hands may dominate in the measurement.
In this research sensor values represent skin resistance.
2) Electromyography

Electromyography (EMG) is a measure of electrical activity
produced by skeletal muscles. For this purpose, three disposable gel electrodes (two regular and one reference) are

Heart Rate Monitoring (HRM) allows to measure and record
the heart rate data such as the number of heartbeats in a given
period and interval. For the purposes of this research we
used POLAR H10 Heart Rate Sensor with Pro Chest Strap,
which was placed around the subject’s chest, just below the
chest muscles. The measurement process is relatively simple:
transmitter is wireless, the receiver must be within a range
of about 0.5 meter. The results depend considerably on the
personal characteristics i.e. age, sex and physical condition,
thus the signal should be normalized to the reference one
(recorded just before the start of the session). Various emotional states and stress result in acceleration of the heart rate.

4) Inertial sensors

D. EXPERIMENT PROCEDURE

Inertial sensors such as accelerometer and gyroscope are
commonly used in human activity recognition [61]. The 3axis accelerometer (ACC) is a device to measure linear acceleration along three axes. A gyroscope is used for measuring
orientation and angular velocity. For the purpose of this
research we used accelerometer and gyroscope built in HTC
Vive Headset [96] to track the displacement of one’s head
from the original position, which provides context information about the physical activity of its user. Since an important
assumption of EMDR session is lack of head movement, we
decided to track this activity to verify whether the subjects
followed all instructions correctly and possibly identify the
elements/moments that can cause irritability or boredom. The
ACC and gyroscope signal is not used to analyze the level of
stress, but serves as a support to recognise the deviations and
irregularities in above mentioned biosensors.

The pilot study included 28 volunteers. They were informed
about the purpose of the study. Procedure of the experiment
was explained to them step by step. Volunteers were informed
that they had the right to withdraw their consent to participate
in the study at any moment. At the beginning of the experiment the operator presents the subject with the standard
protocol of experiment. The protocol includes information on
psychological tests, procedure of sensor installation and time
of VR immersion. All subjects are free to ask any questions
they deem necessary.
Each subject was tested four times in modified experimental conditions which are presented in Tab. 4. Such procedure
was developed to study the effectiveness of different kinds of
BLS in stress reduction.
The order of experimental conditions for the given subject
was random to avoid the bias in self-assessments related
to number of repetitions and learning effect. The sequence
of the actions was the same in each experimental session:
information to the subject, psychological testing, sensors and
VR headset mounting, immersion, sensor and VR headset
unmounting and psychological testing.

C. SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT

Pre and post-questionnaires are based on the following assessment methods:
•

•

•

•

GHQ-12 is the most extensively used screening method
to assess well being developed by Goldberg and
Williams in 1988 [97] (Polish adaptation of the questionnaire was made by Makowska and Merecz in
2001 [98]). Subjects are asked about severity or frequency of 12 symptoms indicating a decrease of well
being in the period of last 3 weeks. In this study we used
4-point Likert scale for scoring (0-1-2-3).
Scales for the measurement of mood and six emotions [99] - there are three scales measuring mood and
six scales measuring frequency of discrete emotions.
For the purpose of the study we used one of them - the
General Mood Scale (GMS) which consists of 10 selfdescriptive statements. Subjects are instructed to state
how much they agree with statements describing their
mood at the moment of examination by using 5-point
response scale (from 1- I don’t agree to 5- I agree).
Actual Stress Level – the one item measure to assess
stress at the moment of examination developed for the
purpose of this study. Subjects are asked to self-assess
their stress level in that moment using 10-point response
scale from 0 - not at all to 10 - so stressed that I can’t
bear it.
VRSQ – Virtual Reality Sickness Questionnaire - a
motion sickness measurement index in a virtual reality
environment [100].

All psychological measurements were performed twice –
before and after immersion in VR. Additionally, after the
session each subject was asked to score the application
answering 10 items with one of five responses that range
from strongly agree to strongly disagree. A field for general
comments was also available. All questionnaire items are
listed in Tab. 2.

E. TECHNIQUES FOR BIO-SIGNAL ANALYSIS

For the purpose of this project we gathered 84 samples from
28 subjects (3 sessions per subject). Next, all samples underwent a selection process in order to check the usefulness for
further analysis. The correct execution of the activity requires
head stillness and simultaneous eye movement. Thus, we
analysed head movements (based on HMD trajectory) in
three axes, although only changes in rotation of axis Y were
taken into consideration for the final assessment.
As it was presented in Sec. III, the whole process is divided
into several different scenes. The first scene (Introductory)
and the last part (Closing) were not taken into account as
their role was to prepare for the exercise and finish the exercise respectively (those scenes allow movements). Starting
from the 90th second, we analysed every core scene (every
second scene, when the subject is supposed to follow the
sphere). Every core scene is preceded by a break, which
allows movements. Typical Y axis rotation is presented in
Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. Rotation is measured relative to the virtual
environment.

Finally, 68 samples from 23 subjects were selected for the
study (see Tab. 3).
In order to smoothen out short-term fluctuations and highlight more long-term trends, from all signals samples a 10second simple moving average (SMA) was calculated (see
Fig. 7) [92]. Finally, we used z-score to standardise all
samples.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
A. SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT RESULTS
FIGURE 6. Typical Y axis rotation: correctly executed exercise.

In order to select only correct samples (no head movement
in core scenes), we calculated the standard deviation in each
core scene. If std value exceeds a threshold of 5◦ , the sample
is rejected for further analysis.

The analysis of compliance with the assumptions in various
tests was performed for all data types (according to Tab. 2).
The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to confirm the normality of
the analyzed distributions. Bartlett’s test was used to confirm
the statement of equal variants of the analyzed results.
We compared the scores of subjective measures obtained
by each vol before (T1) and after (T2) the experimental

session. The comparisons were made using Student t-test
for dependent samples. First, we analysed changes in stress
level and mood between T1 and T2. All participants declared
relatively low stress at the beginning of experiment and
a significant reduction just after (see Tab. 5). The similar
effect was found for 10 mood states (see Tab. 6). After the
experimental session, we obtained significant improvement
of the mood – negative feelings were reduced and positive
ones increased (see Fig. 8).

We believe that mental health status could be a significant
confounder of relationships we studied. Thus, we decided
to control it by the means of General Health Questionnaire,
which was filled in by the participants before the experimental session.
The mean score in General Health Questionnaire (GHQ12)
was 11.93 (SD=5,39), which reflected average mental health
status of the group on the day of the first experimental
session. It appeared that mental health status affected the

level of stress declared by people before the session. The
subjects who scored higher at GHQ-12 (13 points and above)
had higher level of stress than those who scored lower (see
Tab. 7). However, the results of t-Student test proved a significant reduction of declared stress level after the experimental
session in both group of subjects (see Tab. 8).
We did not find any negative effect of VR stress management session in terms of VR sickness symptoms. Counterintuitively, we could even observe a small reduction in
mean general VRSQ score after the experimental session (see
Tab. 9).
In the next step we compared three different experimental
condition types. As is presented in Fig. 10 the mean values
∆T of each method is different. What is worth to mention,
all result in stress level decrease (best results were obtained
for type 1: visual only.).

the means due to this factor. Additionally, (F=0.55) > (F
crit.=2.75), thus the hypothesis that the averages are equal
cannot be rejected, and there is no evidence of this factor
influence.
The above is consistent with the interviews carried out
after each session, where subsequent people indicated large
differences in perception of individual stimuli. For example,
some people tactical stimuli allowed them to focus better, for
others it did not matter. There were also people for whom
tactical sensation was distracting.
The actual mood of a subject was also of great importance. The perception of individual stimuli was therefore
very diverse, but different for individuals. The impact of
additional stimuli could therefore be better studied if the
number of sessions for people using a given stimulus would
be increased. The test would also have to take into account
the dependency of results for a particular individual.

Fig. 11 presents results of the survey on general feelings
about the application. Most subjects appreciated the opportunity offered by VR and would like to use VR as a part of daily
life (69.6%), finding this kind of relaxation therapy comfortable (95.6%). Only 8.3% of the subjects indicated some
discomfort during the session, 8.7% felt eye strain. Haptic
and auditory sensations were sufficient for 86.9% and 95.6%
subjects respectively. Solely in case of question three (I found
the visual part of VR environment realistic) and two (Nothing
bother, interrupt the immersion), which are both concentrated
on the realism of the experience, the assessment leaves room
for improvement. 69.6% of respondents could not immerse
themselves in the VR environment, 34.8% indicated graphic
issues.

FIGURE 11. Results of the survey on general feelings about the application.

B. BIO-SIGNALS ANALYSIS

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method,
we applied a comparison of sensor measurements before and
after the whole session in two different methods. We calculated the difference between the mean value of the first break
scene and mean value of the closing break (first method)
as well as the mean value of the 3rd minute and the mean
value of the 15th minute of the session (second method).
We decided to take into consideration extreme break phases
(first and last) because during those phases the subject does
not focus on the exercise and should be fully relaxed. The
3rd and 15th minutes (second method) are contained in these
particular phases.
The value of the difference should be positive when the
stress level of the subject is reduced in case of HRM and GSR
and negative in the case of EMG signal. Table 12 illustrates
obtained results. The values represent the percentage of positive differences for all signals in both methods. The results
are juxtaposed with the subjective assessment of stress level
(ASL) of each subject. ∆ASL in % represents the number
of positive differences between ASL before and after the
session. Zero-crossing is relevant in case of ASL and that
is why this value has not been standardized. We compared
the correspondence of physiological measurements with a
subjective evaluation during the ASL test. As one can easily
observe the best results are obtained for GSR signal, similar
in both methods: 75% (1st method) and 83.8% (2nd method)

cases where the subject’s stress level was reduced. These
results are close to ∆ASL, which indicates that 89.7% of
the same subjects assessed that their stress level was reduced
during the sessions. Definitely worse results were observed
in case of HRM signal. The values in both approaches are
slightly higher than 50% namely: 57.4% and 58.8% for
the first and the second method respectively. Similar results
were obtained for EMG signal: stress reduction confirmed in
55.9% (1st method) and 57.4% (2nd method) cases.
Next, we compared the results divided for each gender.
According to ∆ASL, the EMDR session was 12.5% more
effective for females. It is also confirmed by all sensor
indications and as in the previous case the best results were
obtained for GSR signal, similar in both methods: in 82.1%
(1st method) and 85.7% (2nd method) cases the female’s
stress level was reduced. Next, we compared the results
divided for age groups. In the group of younger subjects
(<=35) the session was 16% more effective than in the
group of older ones (>35). Similarly, this phenomenon is
best indicated by GSR signals. Young generation is more
familiar and used to modern technology thus we suspect that
participation in VR session did not caused arousal related to
the novelty of situation as in the group of younger participant.
Technological literacy of participants might have an impact
on the results.
According to ∆ASL, the EMDR session was most effective using type 1 mode (visual). It is also confirmed by GSR
sensor indications, in both methods: in 80% (1st method) and
100% (2nd method). However, in this case the sample was the
smallest.

FIGURE 12. Difference between mean value of the first exercise scene and
mean value of the last break obtained for all subjects of type 2 (visual and
auditory) session.

Figure 12 presents the results of 21 individual subjects
taking part in type 2 mode (visual and auditory). The figure
illustrates the comparison of differences between mean value
of the first break scene and mean value of the last break of HR
and GSR with ∆ ASL. As can be seen, 18 subjects evaluated
their stress level as reduced after the session. This evaluation
is confirmed in case of 17 subjects’ GSR signal and by 15
subjects’ HR.
The results of HR and EMG are not fully relevant. This
might be explained by the fact that the study did not involve
stress induction. Our assumption is that because the subjects’

acceleration, thus the changes, even after relaxation, were not
significant.
As far as muscle tension is concerned the fluctuation is
the least observable. Our working theory is that one session
is not enough to observe significant changes and as it was
emphasized before, the initial stress level estimated during
the ASL test was not conducive for extreme, measurable
changes in muscle tension. Further examination will involve
people with anxiety disorders, stress induction and multiple
sessions for checking changes in muscle tension to prove or
disprove its validity in stress measurement for our purposes.
Finally, we compared four different experimental condition types (as presented in Tab. 4). Best results (ASL and
GRS: 85%) were obtained for the second type, where the
visual stimulation is reinforced by auditory one. However,
type one is only 2% (according to ASL) and 4% (according
to GRS) less effective, which uses solely visual stimulation.
Similarly, EMG and HRM sensor indications are much lower,
if not marginal (especially in case of EMG). Vibrating controllers might have influenced the results as well, but it seems
to be a highly individualized factor, as some subjects claimed
that they actually helped them focus and some considered
them disruptive and made focusing on three stimuli simultaneously impossible.
V. CONCLUSION

In this study an automated therapy tool comprising an interactive VR simulation was developed to demonstrate that
VR may serve as a tool supporting relaxation training program. Thus, we integrated VR with the bilateral stimulation
together with a set of sensors to monitor a subject’s psychophysical condition. A pilot treatment programme was carried
out on an experimental group consisting of 28 healthy adult
volunteers (office workers). All subjects participated in three
sessions of relaxation training, which differ only by the
mode of bilateral stimulation (visual, visual+auditory, visual,
auditory and tactile). Data collected from questionnaires
shows that VR can be useful for reducing the acute stress
level. We obtained the significant reduction of subjectively
measured stress and improvement of participant mood after
relaxation sessions. The results of assessment via questionnaires were compared with automated sensor measurement.

The highest correlation of ASL was observed based on GSR
signal. Measurements of muscle tension and heart rate did
not prove significant convergence with ASL and they were
not effective enough as a stress indicator in this research.
The pattern of results may reflects at least three phenomena:
(1) limitations and drawbacks of self-reported questionnaires
as e.g. response or social desirability biases; (2) the fact
that participants in the study were healthy adults, in good
mental shape thus we could not expect high variability of
HR and muscle tension indicators; (3) short duration of the
experimental session, which was not preceded by training.
This pilot study was aimed to test usefulness of bilateral
stimulation in VR environment for treatment people under
stress, and this goal has been obtained. Promising results
show that VR based BLS may improve the mood and reduce
stress. However further studies are needed. Future works
may focus on :(1) finding the best physiological indicator of
mood and stress changes due to the training; (2) comparison
of effectiveness of single session versus multiple session
programme; (3) long term effects of VR based relaxation
training; (4) added value of VR to BLS in EMDR. All above
mentioned directions of studies should be based on randomises clinical trial methodology. We plan to continue our
research in clinical samples of patients with depression and
anxiety disorders to compare the effectiveness of standard
BLS relaxation and BLS relaxation in virtual reality in longer
time perspective.
From the technical side, further development of this
project would have to take into consideration the possibility
to select the environment in which the subject prefers to
relax, for example starry night, meadow or underwater world.
According to general comments more than 50% of subjects
felt their immersion was not total because the environment
did not feel real. To provide a realistic experience, focus
should be put on the surroundings, thus in the future the
object and scene will be developed in a more attractive way.
The expected result of the application is to improve the
quality of therapy by introducing an innovative tool and
reducing the time professionals have to dedicate to a single
patient, which will result in both better treatment outcomes
and increasing the number of patients who can be treated
by a single specialist. Implementation of an innovative VR13

based technology will enrich depression and anxiety disorder
treatment. It may improve efficiency and reduce cost and time
of therapy, and will provide the possibility to be used outside
of medical units, even in developing countries, and enhance
universal access to health care.
