Summary. During lucid moments of a dream, the sleeper is aware of the dream as it is occurring, and as a result can
often perform predetermined actions within the dream. This provides a unique opportunity for dream research, as lucid
dreamers can send real-time signals from sleep to the external world. Historically, such sleep-to-wake communication
from a lucid dream is executed via left-right eye movements, which places hard limitations on information transfer. Recent advances in biomedical equipment — specifically brain-computer interfaces — have resulted in headsets that use
neural recordings to translate mental imagery into computer commands. In light of evidence suggesting that dreamed
and imagined actions recruit similar neural resources, I considered the possibility that the same mental commands that
are collected and translated from waking imagery could be similarly performed and detected from within a lucid dream.
In this exploratory study with proof-of-concept intent, three participants were asked to use an Emotiv EPOC+ headset
and companion software to map a mental motor command (pushing a block) with a resulting computer action (graphic
of block moving forward). After waking training, participants attempted to induce a lucid dream while wearing the headset, and upon lucidity perform the same mental command. In two participants, subjectively reported lucid dream task
completion was corroborated with video footage of the resulting computer graphic. These preliminary results suggest
that a wake-trained brain-computer interface can be controlled from sleep and offer important directions for future dream
communication and research.

Introduction

During a lucid dream, the (lucid) dreamer is aware of the
dream state as it is occurring (Baird et al., 2019; LaBerge
et al., 1981). This awareness of the dream state often coincides with some level of volitional control over dream content and actions (Dresler et al., 2014; Stumbrys et al., 2014).
The ability of a participant to perform specific actions within
the dream led to the initial objective verification of lucid
dreaming (Hearne, 1978; LaBerge et al., 1981). Eye movements and fist clenches within the dream have predictable
and measurable external physiological correlates, which
were used to send predetermined signals from a sleeping
participant to the experimenter (detected via polysomnography). This method of communicating from a dream with
left-right-left-right (LRLR) eye signals has become the defacto standard for timestamping the moment of lucidity during relevant experiments (Baird et al., 2019) and has also
been used as a method of communicating to the researcher
in real-time from sleep (Appel, 2013; Konkoly & Paller, 2019,
see also Fenwick et al., 1984).
However, this method of communication has limitations.

places a hard limitation on the amount of information that
can be sent over a limited time. Participants with knowledge of Morse code have communicated from sleep by using left/right muscle clenches or eye movements as long/
short tones to represent letters (Appel, 2013; LaBerge et
al., 1981). While allowing for more complex signaling, this
method’s shortcoming is the length of time required to
send a message. The duration of lucidity is limited, and
thus Morse code messages from a lucid dream are typically restricted to just a few letters. A survey study found
that participants reported an average estimated duration of
about 14 minutes for their home lucid dreams (Stumbrys et
al., 2014), although this might not be the same for laboratory lucid dreams. Further, Morse code is not a common
language and requires significant effort for the participant
to learn. More advanced eye-tracking methods have found
that specific shapes can be drawn with orchestrated eye
movement patterns (LaBerge et al., 2018), but it is unclear
if this can serve as an effective real-time communication
system (although see Appel, 2019). Thus, current sleep-towake signaling methods are largely limited to binary messages or numbers (e.g., x amount of eye movements). The
limitations of these signaling methods hinder research and
the development of applications that utilize sleep-to-wake
communication (Appel et al., 2018). Here, I propose a proofof-concept for a communication method that could overcome these current limitations.
Current sleep-to-wake communication methods are effective in-so-far-as (lucidly) dreamed actions share a similar
physiology as waking actions and imagery (Dresler et al.,
2011; Erlacher & Schredl, 2008). The notion that imagined
actions recruit similar neural resources as waking is also a
key premise behind brain-computer interface (BCI) technol-

ogy (Chaudhary et al., 2016; Lebedev & Nicolelis, 2006).
BCIs recording neural signals from motor cortex have allowed clinically immobilized patients to control robotic arms
or other digital computer signals using only mental imagery
or movement intentions (Wolpaw et al., 2002). Most lucid
dreams occur in rapid eye movement sleep (LaBerge, 1988;
LaBerge et al., 1986), at which stage muscle atonia increases motor neuron inhibition, effectively paralyzing the sleeper
with the exception of eye movements and muscle twitches
(Chase & Morales, 1990). Therefore, a clinically immobilized
patient and an actively lucid dreaming participant might be
in a similar situation of being both conscious of their waking
body and fully intent on moving their limbs, despite being
unable to do so. Accordingly, I hypothesized that due to the
ability of a lucid dreamer to perform predetermined actions
during a dream and the neural overlap between waking and
lucidly dreamed actions, a BCI that could be successfully
controlled during waking could be similarly controlled during a lucid dream.
Experienced lucid dreaming participants were recruited to
test this hypothesis in an exploratory pilot study. For each
participant, a consumer-grade BCI (Emotiv EPOC+) was
trained to distinguish between the presence and absence
of a specific mental imagery task, and then upon lucidity
the same mental task was performed. All participants subjectively reported performing the task during a lucid dream,
as indicated by written dream reports and lucidity-focused
questionnaires. When participants were asleep but not performing the task, the BCI showed little detection of the task.
Importantly, when participants performed the task during a
lucid dream (prefaced with LRLR eye movements), the BCI
showed increased task detection levels.
Due to low-quality equipment and lack of access to the
BCI’s algorithms, this preliminary investigation warrants
scrutiny and further verification. Yet, the results suggest that
a BCI trained on a waking mental imagery task can then be
controlled during sleep by performing the same task when
volition reappears in lucid dreaming. While the current study
focused on BCI detection of a single command, the rapid
development and potential of BCI research suggest that
BCI technology could offer a solution to existing sleep-towake communication limitations.

Methods

2.1. Participants
Three experienced lucid dreamers (reporting successful lucid dream induction in >25% of attempts) participated in
the current pilot study. All participants were recruited via
personal contact except sub-001 (the author). All participants were male between the ages of 25 and 35 years (sub001=26, sub-003=25, sub-004=35). One volunteer (sub002) dropped out after consent and did not follow through
with any steps of participation. Participant sub-001 reported completing the task, but due to a computer malfunction (no data was recorded during the sleep session) is not
included in analyses (but dream report and questionnaires
are included in SI). Participant sub-003 was a narcoleptic.
Narcoleptics show an increased tendency towards lucidity
during dreams (Dodet et al., 2015; Rak et al., 2015) and are
increasingly used in lucid dreaming research (e.g., Oudiette
et al., 2018). Research was performed in accordance with
the University of Missouri Institutional Review Board.

to sleep with the headset on by lying on their
backs and without support under the upper half
of the head. B) Emotiv Controlpanel software. The
mental block-pushing task (MBPT) involves
imagining this virtual block moving forward (i.e.,
deeper) into the screen. During training, the block
animates moving forward while the participant
performs the MBPT. During testing, the block
only animates when the headset detects the MBPT.

2.2. Brain-computer interface
The BCI setup was an Emotiv EPOC+ headset (Figure 1A)
and companion software (Xavier Controlpanel 3.0.0.44;
Xavier TestBench 3.0.0.37) running on a Macbook Pro laptop. The Emotiv EPOC+ is a 14-channel mobile electroencephalograph (EEG) system designed to maximize efficacy,
mobility, and affordability while maintaining a level of reliability near laboratory-grade EEG systems (Badcock et al.,
2013; Bobrov et al., 2011; De Vos et al., 2014; Debener et
al., 2012; Taylor & Schmidt, 2012; Zich et al., 2015). The
EPOC+ responds to 0.16-43 Hz using 14 (plus 2 reference)
saline-soaked sensors at the following electrode locations:
AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, AF4
(references at left/right mastoids). The main feature of the
Emotiv EPOC+ is the ability to build an EEG classifier that
detects the intention of moving a virtual block and displays
a corresponding graphic upon intention detection. The general layout for training and testing the EPOC+ is 1) a virtual
block is displayed in the middle of the computer screen
(Figure 1B), 2) a resting state, or non-task, EEG signal is collected under a neutral label, 3) EEG data is collected under
a push label while the user performs a mental block-pushing task (MBPT), 4) after steps 2 and 3 are repeated, the
user only has to perform the MBPT and the virtual block will
move forward (i.e., push) in response. One potential challenge in the current design was that the back of the EPOC+
headset protrudes a few inches, possibly making it difficult
to wear while sleeping. However, slight modifications such
as the addition of neck support enabled the EPOC+ to be
used during sleep. Battery life of the EPOC+ is reported as
greater than 6 hours using wireless connectivity (Bluetooth),
which was ample time for the current study design.

2.3. Lucid dream induction technique
The study was designed such that participants could employ
their preferred lucid dream induction technique (Price & Cohen, 1988; Stumbrys et al., 2012). Accordingly, the EPOC+
was applied either preceding an afternoon nap (sub-003)
or during the morning/awake period of a wake-back-to-bed
(WBTB; sub-001 and sub-004). WBTB is a common lucid

dream induction technique that involves waking up after
about five hours of sleep, staying awake for 10-90 minutes,
and returning to bed with the intention of having a lucid
dream (LaBerge, 1980; Stumbrys et al., 2012). The potential
lucid dream generally occurs anywhere from sleep onset to
one hour into the second sleep period.

2.4. General procedure
Participants completed a training phase of approximately 45 minutes during wake where they learned to push a
virtual block with mental effort, followed by a test phase
where they tried to induce a lucid dream and push the same
virtual block during sleep. The goal of the training phase
was to train the BCI on the distinction between a participant performing the MBPT and rest. The goal of the testing
phase was to establish whether the same MBPT could be
performed and detected during a lucid dream. Participants
were allowed to complete a train-test sequence on multiple occasions. Because participants varied in their specific protocols as a result of different lucid dream induction
techniques, the details of their procedures varied and are
included in the Results section.

2.5. Training phase
After the BCI was properly set up on the participant, the BCI
was trained on the MBPT. The participant was instructed
to alternate performing the MBPT and a resting task for
8-second segments while EEG was recorded and mapped
to Emotiv software labels push and neutral, respectively. For
the MBPT, the participant was told: “Imagine pushing the
block – however you choose to imagine it, all that matters
is that the thought is consistent.” For the resting task, the
participant was told: “Clear your head.” These instructions
were a subtly modified version of those provided by Emotiv.
Participants alternated between MBPT and rest mappings
until they passed a qualitative evaluation of successful
training. To evaluate BCI training, the participant again alternated between the MBPT and rest, but here the BCI only
measured EEG and decoded the participant’s thought process (MBPT vs. rest). If perfectly trained, the block graphic
would move forward only and always during the MBPT, indicating 100% decoding accuracy. This verification step was
completed intermittently throughout the training phase until
the BCI could accurately detect the MBPT on ~70% of attempts.

64

2.6. Testing phase
The testing phase consisted of the participant falling asleep
with the BCI on, attempting to induce a lucid dream, and
upon lucidity repeating the same MBPT they performed during training. As is customary in lucid dreaming studies, each
participant was asked to first confirm the lucid dream state
with a LRLR eye signal (Figure 2) before attempting the experimental task (Baird et al., 2019). This signal also serves
to timestamp the beginning of dream task execution. Each
participant was asked to repeat a sequence of the LRLR
signal and 8-10 seconds of the MBPT as many times as
possible once lucid in the dream. Computer activity showing both EEG and virtual block activity was recorded and
reviewed offline. Immediately upon awakening, participants
were asked to complete a custom waking survey that included a written dream report, specific questions about the
MBPT and LRLR signaling, the Dream Lucidity Questionnaire (DLQ; Stumbrys et al., 2013) and the Lucidity and Consciousness in Dreams scale (LuCiD; Voss et al., 2013).

2.7. Analysis
Emotiv does not offer access to their machine learning algorithms or classifier decision output. To quantify the BCI’s
detection of the MBPT during sleep, the testing phase video
was separated into 8-second segments centered around
the first LRLR eye signal, and within each segment the
“MBPT detection” score is the proportion of time that the
display showed MBPT detection. To evaluate the ability of
the BCI to detect the MBPT performed during a lucid dream,
the MBPT detection scores during reported lucid dream
MBPT completion were compared against all other MBPT
detection scores (i.e., those from segments during sleep
that the participant did not report performing the MBPT).
Instructions to the participants were to attempt the MBPT
during lucidity for 8-10 seconds after LRLR signaling, but
to account for possible time discrepancies between lucid
dreaming and waking (Erlacher et al., 2014), MBPT detection scores of the two segments following LRLR signaling
were averaged, resulting in a single MBPT detection score
to be compared against all others. The p-values were calculated as the proportion of null distribution MBPT detection
scores that were greater than the single MBPT detection
score from the lucid dream MBPT completion. Each participant’s empirical null distribution was bootstrapped by resampling with replacement 10000 times from all MBPT detection scores outside of the lucid dream MBPT completion.

This analysis was performed individually on each test phase
where the participant reported completing the MBPT during a lucid dream. Analyses were performed using NumPy
(Oliphant, 2006) and Pandas (McKinney, 2010) in an IPython
(Perez & Granger, 2007) environment. Data visualizations
were performed using Matplotlib (Hunter, 2007).

Results

After waking training, the BCI was able to reliably detect the
MBPT within each participant. In a following sleep session,
participants were asked to become lucid while dreaming
and then perform the same MBPT after a LRLR eye signal.
To evaluate whether the BCI detected this task during sleep,
MBPT detection scores from the time of lucid dream task
completion were compared against the MBPT scores of
all other sleep segments. Two participants successfully induced a lucid dream and self-reported performing the MBPT
task after LRLR eye signaling while video was being recorded. Objective evidence corroborating task completion was
present with one participant, while the other showed mild
evidence, together suggesting proof-of-concept support for
BCI communication from a lucid dream. The results from
each of these two cases are reported separately below.
Participant sub-003 reported frequently becoming lucid
during afternoon naps, and so performed the experiment
during two afternoon sessions. During the first session sub003 reported becoming lucid but not performing the MBPT
during the dream, and so returned for a second session.
Participant sub-003 completed the training phase in a simulated sleep position in the hopes to mimic the test phase
as much as possible. This consisted of lying down in the
expected sleeping position (on back) with eyes closed and

lights off. On the second train-test sequence, the training
phase was stopped after approximately 30 minutes because the BCI was well-trained, as indicated by the small
95% confidence interval of the null distribution ([0,.52]; Figure 3C; see also verification video clip: https://osf.io/2gctz/).
Because all MBPT detection scores in the null distribution
come from segments during sleep where the MBPT was not
being performed, the spread of this distribution is a measure of how well the BCI was trained (where higher spread
implies poorer training). Training was followed immediately
by a nap and lucid dream MBPT attempt. During this nap,
sub-003 reported successfully becoming lucid and completing the MBPT during the lucid dream (Figure 3A). DLQ
scores indicate clear subjective lucidity (Figure 3B). Participant sub-003 reported attempting the task twice consecutively upon lucidity, and the averaged MBPT score of the
two segments following LRLR signaling was far outside the
null distribution of non-task relevant MBPT test scores (.91,
p<.0001; Figure 3C; see video clip of MBPT during lucid
dream: https://osf.io/ane86/).
Participant sub-004 performed the training phase while
sitting upright at a desk, directly in front of the laptop. The
training phase in total took approximately 90 minutes (with
breaks) because there was less success in training the BCI
(null distribution confidence interval = [0,.76]; Figure 4C),
possibly due to a weaker headset (Bluetooth) connection.
Participant sub-004 went to sleep according to their regular
nightly schedule, but woke up approximately five hours after sleep, performed the training phase, and then returned
to sleep. Participant sub-004 reported becoming lucid and
completing the MBPT once following LRLR signaling during a lucid dream (Figure 4A), and DLQ scores suggest the

Discussion

The present pilot data show preliminary evidence suggesting
that BCIs developed for waking control with mental imagery
(Chaudhary et al., 2016; Lebedev & Nicolelis, 2006; Wolpaw
et al., 2002) can be similarly used from within a lucid dream.
Three participants with high lucid dream induction success
rates reported performing a specific mental task during a
lucid dream in an attempt to activate a consumer-grade BCI
that was trained on the same mental task during waking. Of
the two participants whose data was successfully recorded
through the sleep session, one showed clear evidence of
the BCI detecting the task and the other showed mild evidence. The participant who showed less evidence also had
lower signal quality during BCI training and testing. Importantly, this study includes many caveats and limitations and
necessitates further investigations that involve more sophisticated BCI technology and analyses before drawing firm
conclusions.
The BCI used in the current study was trained to distinguish only between the presence and absence of a single
mental task (i.e., the MBPT), which offers no advancement
beyond the already common LRLR eye signaling frequently
used in the literature (Baird et al., 2019). This restriction was
applied for pilot purposes, but if a single mental task can
be detected, then increasing the range of detectable tasks
should also be plausible. Such an increase in message options would provide a more efficient mode of communica-

66

tion from sleep to waking. With further verification of lucid
dreaming BCI control, the improvement in communication
abilities from a sleeping participant to a waking researcher
is a promising application that could benefit both research
and clinical fields (Appel et al., 2018).
For research, an increase in communication abilities
would allow for live dream reporting rather than relying on
waking dream recall (Windt, 2013), which has its own limitations (Rosen, 2013; Solomonova et al., 2014). Additionally,
lucid dreaming offers a rare state of consciousness with its
own neurophysiological signature (Dresler et al., 2012; Voss
et al., 2009), and probing cognition during this state is an
intriguing avenue of consciousness research (Appel et al.,
2018; Baird et al., 2019; Windt & Noreika, 2011). Probing
the lucid dreaming brain during sleep is a promising experimental approach (Appel, 2013; Appel & Pipa, 2017; Konkoly
& Paller, 2019), and increasing response options from the
dream with imagery and motor actions has the potential to
increase experiment complexity. Furthermore, lucid dreaming has been consistently linked with creativity (Blagrove &
Hartnell, 2000; Stumbrys & Daniels, 2010), but a recent suggestion is that creative solutions that occur during dreaming are less- or in-accessible upon awakening (Stumbrys &
Daunytė, 2018). Being able to control computer signals from
a dream – either to send messages or to directly control
other tools – opens avenues for extracting that creativity.
BCI research is largely motivated by developing communication tools for those who are currently restricted by clinical conditions (Chatelle et al., 2012; Chaudhary et al., 2016;
Luauté et al., 2015; Wolpaw et al., 2002) such as motor disorders (Bauer et al., 1979) or disorders of consciousness
(Bernat, 2006; Owen, 2008). In extreme cases, it is unclear
if such patients are conscious. Thus, a crucial line of re-

BCI during a lucid dream

search is to develop response options for immobilized patients (Chatelle et al., 2012; Monti et al., 2010; Owen et al.,
2006, 2016). While patient populations are currently used in
the development of BCI communication tools, these experiments are often unable to distinguish whether the patient is
not conscious or just unable to control the BCI (Overgaard &
Overgaard, 2011; Peterson et al., 2015). Most lucid dreams
occur in REM sleep (LaBerge, 1988; LaBerge et al., 1986),
which includes muscle atonia that prevents most overt motor actions (Chase & Morales, 1990). This physiological similarity suggests that lucid dreaming participants might serve
as a viable model for developing methods to communicate
with clinically immobilized patients.
Performing an action during a dream can itself be considered a form of mental imagery, since the entire experience is
internally generated. Interestingly, it is also possible to use
mental imagery within a lucid dream (Worsley, 1988; Zadra,
2016). This event is unique to the dream state in that there
are two levels of internal representation involved; the dream
character – already an internal representation – is able to
generate another internal representation using mental imagery. In the current study, participants were instructed to
use mental imagery for the MBPT during waking and then
simply repeat the task during their lucid dream. Explicit instructions as to whether they should act out or imagine the
MBPT during their dream wasn’t specified, and which of
these two alternatives they chose was unclear from initial
dream reports (see SI for full dream reports). The prediction
here that a BCI could be controlled during a lucid dream
was based on research into the neural overlap between action, imagery, and lucid dream actions (Dresler et al., 2011),
but future work might distinguish between the neural representations of lucid dream actions and lucid dream imagery.
Without proper polysomnography, it is not possible to objectively verify that participants were indeed asleep. That is,
participants might have been awake – even without awareness of it (Campbell & Webb, 1981) – while performing the
MBPT. This is unlikely given that all participants were experienced lucid dreamers and highly familiar with their sleep
patterns/experiences. Further limitations include the use of
consumer-grade BCI equipment and a proprietary decoding
algorithm.
To my knowledge, the current pilot exploration is the first
to demonstrate that a BCI trained on waking imagery can
be controlled with similar intentions during a lucid dream.
Aforementioned limitations and the use of only a few participants prevent strong inferences but indicate that further
research should be conducted to evaluate whether BCIs will
serve as an efficient mode of communication from sleep.
