Abstract: We developed a new type of electroencephalogram (EEG) headset system with
comb-shaped electrodes that enables the wearer to quickly don and utilize it in daily life. Two models
that can measure EEG signals using up to eight channels have been implemented. The electrodes
implemented in the headsets are similar to a comb and are placed quickly by wiping the hair (as
done with a comb) using the headset. To verify this headset system, donning time was measured and
three brain computer interface (BCI) application experiments were conducted. Alpha rhythm-based,
steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based, and auditory steady state response (ASSR)-based
BCI systems were adopted for the validation experiments. Four subjects participated and ten trials
were repeated in the donning experiment. The results of the validation experiments show that reliable
EEG signal measurement is possible immediately after donning the headsets without any preparation.
It took approximately 10 s for healthy subjects to don the headsets, including an earclip with reference
and ground electrodes. The results of alpha rhythm-based BCI showed 100% accuracy. Furthermore,
the results of SSVEP-based and ASSR-based BCI experiments indicate that performance is sufficient
for BCI applications; 95.7% and 76.0% accuracies were obtained, respectively. The results of BCI
paradigm experiments indicate that the new headset type is feasible for various BCI applications.

1. Introduction
There are various applications based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, such as brain
computer interface (BCI), brain mapping, sleep research, clinical diagnosis, and authentication [1–6].
Multichannel measurement of EEG signals is required for such applications. However, measuring
EEG signals from multiple spots on the scalp can only be implemented in a hospital or laboratory
environment. This is because the preparation process for EEG measurement is time-consuming and
laborious, even for experts, as localization of sites for the electrical montage, attaching electrodes to
the respective spots, gel injection, and impedance checking are necessary. This complex procedure
required for EEG measurement is one of the major obstacles to practical application outside of hospital
or laboratory environments. To overcome this drawback and simplify the procedure, various types

paradigm [15–22]. SSVEP, which consists of the responses of the occipital region caused by visual
stimulation at specific frequencies, is also an extensively used paradigm in mental spellers [23–30].
Hwang et al. introduced an SSVEP-based BCI spelling system by adopting the QWERTY-style LED
keyboard [23]. The results of an online experiment yielded an average spelling speed of 9.39 letters per
minute, with an average success rate of 85.58%.
Recently, studies on hybrid BCIs have been reported. These hybrid BCIs combine various types of
existing BCIs, such as ERD and SSVEP, motor imagery and SSVEP, and EEG and non-EEG. In particular,
some hybrid BCIs have combined P300 and SSVEP. For instance, Panicker et al. introduced a P300
BCI with SSVEP [31]. In their system, the SSVEP response served as a passive “brain switch.” While
Panicker et al. combined P300 and SSVEP sequentially, Xu et al. and Yin et al. combined them
simultaneously [32,33]. Specifically, Xu et al. proposed a 3 × 3 P300-based matrix with an SSVEP
blocking feature. In their study, the SSVEP blocking feature worked as a supplementary parameter for
discriminating the presence or absence of a P300 evoked potential. They reported that the combination
of P300 and the SSVEP blocking feature enhanced the overall performance of the system. Yin et al.
proposed a 6 × 6 P300-based matrix with SSVEP, and integrated the SSVEP into the conventional P300
paradigm. They achieved an online classification accuracy of 93.85% and an information transfer rate
(ITR) of 56.44 bits/min.
The auditory steady-state response (ASSR)-based BCI paradigm is a relatively new BCI concept,
and can be classified as a vision-free BCI paradigm. In contrast to the SSVEP or the P300 paradigms,
subjects do not need to move their eyes to enforce their desired commands. This could constitute
a solution for patients who are completely paralyzed and cannot move their body parts, including
their eyes.
In this paper, we present two multichannel EEG headsets that can be donned quickly and then
measure EEG signals immediately. Our approach is focused on reducing the preparation and donning
time for multichannel EEG signals measurement. The details of validation experiments conducted
with the headsets are presented in the results section. Further, BCI applications are manipulated using
the instant-donning headsets. Experiments using SSVEP-based and ASSR-based BCI systems were
conducted with the headsets and the results compared with previous studies.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Electrodes
To develop instant donning headsets, reversed-curve arch electrodes introduced in our previous
work [9] were used. The electrode was fabricated using sterling silver via a 3D printer (Perfactory,
EnvisonTEC, Gladbeck, Germany). The sterling silver was an alloy containing 92.5% silver and 7.5%
copper by mass. The electrode was 10 mm2 in size, with five reverse-curved arches. The comb-like
unique structure of these electrodes increases the area of skin-electrode contact on hairy scalps and
results in lower skin-electrode impedance and decreased pain [9]. Multi-channel electrodes were
designed and fabricated to different heights reflecting the curvature of the head. The structure of the
electrode and a photograph are presented in Figure 2a.
A preamplifier was attached to the other side of the base of the electrode, as shown in Figure 2b.
A high-input impedance op-amp (OPA124, Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX, USA), which has an input
impedance of 1013 Ω||1 pF, was selected for use as the preamplifier. The bias resistor R B is used to
provide a biased current path to the preamp. The value of the bias resistor is 5 GΩ. The overall
equivalent electrical circuit of the electrode is shown in Figure 3. The gain of the circuit is given by

2.2. Headsets
2.2. Headsets
Two types of headsets were designed for BCI application: (1) an around-type that extends
to the transversal plane of the head; (2) a posterior-type that covers the occipital and parietal
region. Each headset type has two sizes, respectively, small and large for different size of the head.
These headsets have been designed such that all electrodes are able to reach the scalp surface while
being placed on the head; this capability eliminates the need for preparation procedures and allows
EEG signal measurement immediately after donning. Two 3D models of the headsets are illustrated
in Figure 5a,b. The headsets were designed in the SOLIDWORKS®environment and fabricated in
plastic using a 3D printer. They have square holes for the electrodes to be affixed. All electrodes are
aligned in the vertical direction of their arches (Figure 5a,b). Based on the 10-20 international system,
the locations of EEG measurements with the around-type headset are “F7,” “T7,” “P7,” “PO3,” “PO4,”
“P8,” “T8,” and “F8” (Figure 5c). For the posterior-type, the locations are “Pz,” “PO3,” “POz,” “PO4,”
“O1,” “Oz,” and “O2” (Figure 5d). For the around-type headset, all electrodes are able to reach the
surface of the scalp by being combed through the hair and toward the scalp from a point several

and toward the scalp from the crown of the head to the measurement spots, all electrodes are able to
reach the surface of the scalp while the headset is being donned. By combing with the headsets, the
hair smoothly goes into the gaps between the arches of the electrodes and the electrodes easily reach
the surface of the scalp.
The signal from each electrode goes to the positive input of an instrumentation amplifier (INA118,
Texas instruments Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) while the signal from the reference electrode goes to the
negative input of the amplifier. The difference of these two signals is amplified with a gain of 11 in
the amplifier. The output signal is sequentially filtered by a second order high-pass filter at a cutoff
frequency of 0.5 Hz, amplified at a gain of 300, and again filtered by a fourth order low-pass filter
at a frequency of 50 Hz. The analog filter and gain circuit are designed with a quad operational
amplifier (OP497, Analog devices, Norwood, MA, USA). The output signals of the analog circuit are
digitalized at a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz using a data acquisition system (NI USB-6229, National
Instruments Corporation, Austin, TX, USA). The overall schematic of the data processing system is

commands issued during the run [36]), were calculated. The ITR is a well-known parameter for BCI

3.4. ASSR-Based BCI Paradigm
The experimental paradigm and signal processing of ASSR-based BCI from Kim et al. and Baek
et al. [34,37,38] were employed in this experiment. The frequency of the stimulus on the left was a
2.5 kHz pure tone with a modulation frequency of 37 Hz, while the frequency of the stimulus on the
right was a 1 kHz pure tone with a modulation frequency of 43 Hz. The around-type EEG headset was
used for the experiments for T7 and T8 measurements. Four subjects participated in the experiment.
They were visually and verbally instructed to attend to one of the stimuli in random order at the
beginning of each trial. The time window for data analyses was 20 s for online experiments. The length
of the analysis time affected the overall ITR and accuracy of the BCI system. Therefore, although it is
necessary to identify the optimal length of this time window, this task falls outside the scope of this
study. The ASSR-based BCI application with instant-donning headsets was evaluated according to

the ratio of correct decisions to the total number of trials, specificity, and sensitivity. To calculate the
specificity and sensitivity, it was assumed that the right is positive, while the left is negative.

are slightly better. It was also observed that the results for the BCI experienced subjects (S1, S2) were
better than those for the non-experienced subjects (S3, S4). Considering preparation and donning time,
the proposed system has more advantages for BCI application.

5. Discussion
We presented two EEG headsets that can be donned quickly and used to immediately measure
EEG signals using up to eight channels. Experiments conducted to demonstrate the quick setup for
EEG headset with the presence of spontaneous EEG and BCI experiments were conducted. It took
approximately 10 s for healthy subjects to don the headsets, including the earclip with the reference
and ground electrodes. To the best of our knowledge, such a short preparation and donning time has
never been reported previously. Reliable EEG signals were observed after the fast setup. The results of
BCI experiments showed the feasibility of the headsets for various BCI applications.
The headsets introduced are designed such that the electrodes can be replaced manually to ensure
that they fit the curvature or the shape of the head of the particular subject. However, once the
combination of electrodes is set for one subject, it would be difficult to use the headset on another
subject; the electrodes would need to be reset for the headset to be used on another subject, which could
be time-consuming. To solve this problem, the headsets should be made from material that is more
flexible so that the headset can fit the shape of any head more easily after donning it. An experiment
with supine patients should be conducted in the future. In this study, only healthy subjects participated
in the experiments. This constitutes one of the limitations of the study. Validation experiments with
ALS patients who are potential users of the BCI system should be conducted in a separate study.
The proposed headsets measure up to eight channels of EEG signals simultaneously; however,
more channels are required for various applications. Therefore, headsets that have more than ten
channels should be considered in a future study. In addition, low power consumption, wireless data
transmission, and strategies to reduce motion artifacts should be part of a future study on ambulatory
monitoring of EEG signals.
Table 5 compares the results obtained in this study with those of several previously published
studies. As indicated, the results obtained in this study are similar to (for ASSR) or higher than (for
SSVEP) those obtained from previous studies. However, considering the preparation and donning
time, the proposed system possesses more advantages for BCI applications.

We can easily search and identify numerous internet video clips on EEG-based BCI applications.
However, almost all of these video clips were recorded after the EEG measurement system was set up
and prepared to measure the EEG signals. This is obviously because of the prohibitively long time
needed for the preparation procedure. By contrast, in this study, the BCI application was conducted
with instant-donning EEG headsets. It took approximately 10 s to don the headsets, and reliable EEG
signals could be measured immediately. The SSVEP-based and the ASSR-based BCI systems were
adopted for the validation experiment. The results obtained with the proposed system are congruent
with those obtained in the previous study that used capacitive electrodes [34].
To derive better results in terms of the BCI experiment, signal processing should be considered,
such as use of a classification algorithm, and optimization of the time window. However, such work is
outside the current scope of this study.
6. Conclusions
To date, various electrode types have been introduced for EEG measurement. However, existing
electrodes have inherent drawbacks. With Ag/AgCl electrodes, skin irritation and gel dehydration
limit long-term measurement of EEG signals. Consequently, a time-consuming and laborious procedure
is required for multichannel measurement with this electrode type. As regards reducing skin irritation,
dry-contact electrodes or capacitive coupling electrodes are considered alternative solutions. However,
they also have their own drawbacks. Dry-contact electrodes typically have spiky structures to reach to
the surface of the scalp passing through the hair. With these structures, however, only the tips contact
the surface of the scalp, resulting in high skin-electrode impedance and pain. Capacitive coupling
electrodes, on the other hand, do not need direct contact between skin and electrode. However, they
are vulnerable to motion artifacts, which results in low signal-to-noise ratios.
In various EEG-based applications, multichannel EEG measurement is required. However,
time-consuming and laborious preparation with assistance limit the measurement to implementation
only in a hospital or laboratory. The preparation includes attaching electrodes and gel injection on
respective spots on the scalp. This complex procedure for EEG measurement is a bottleneck for
practical applications in daily life.
In this study, a new dry EEG electrode structure developed in our previous work was applied
to headset. In contrast to existing dry EEG electrodes, it does not have a spiky structure but instead
a reversed-curve-arch-shape. The comb-like unique structure increases the skin-electrode contact
area on hairy scalps resulting in lower skin-electrode impedance and reduced probability of pain.
Two types of quick-setup multichannel EEG headsets were introduced. These two headset types are
designed such that all electrodes are able to reach the surface of the scalp while they are being donned,
which means that no preparation procedures are required and EEG signals measurement is possible
immediately after donning. Validation and BCI experiments with the headsets were conducted to
validate the headsets. The results of the validation experiments show that reliable reasoning from
EEG signals is possible immediately after donning the headsets without any preparation. Further, the

results of SSVEP-based and ASSR-based BCI experiments show that the performance is sufficient for
BCI applications, with accuracies of 95.7% and 76.0%, respectively.
In conclusion, we hope that the developed system will contribute to the acceleration of EEG-based
research, such that EEG measurement and applications will become ubiquitous throughout our
daily activities.
