Abstract—In this study, the person verification using brainwaves evoked by unperceivable vibration stimulation is proposed.
Brainwaves in the participants were measured while they were
given unperceivable vibration stimuli, and their inducibility and
individuality were examined on the basis of a t-test using
spectral content rates in θ, α, and β wavebands. In addition, the
verification performance using the content rates as an individual
feature was evaluated using Euclidian distance matching. The
average equal error rate of all electrodes was approximately 34
%.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Biometric technology, such as fingerprints and facial recognition has been introduced in recent years and is now commonly used in devices such as smartphones. However, biometric data invariably involve body surfaces, making theft
easy; for instance, facial images can easily be captured on a
digital camera and copies can be made. In addition, fingerprint
and facial recognition assume one-time-only authentication, so
there is a risk of spoofing. After verification by a regular user
of a system using his/her biometric data, even if he/she is
switched to an imposter who does not have a license to use
the system, it is impossible to detect spoofing using biometrics
based on one-time-only authentication.
In order to deal with this problem, continuous authentication is more effective than one-time-only authentication. As
biometrics suitable for continuous authentication, brainwaves
(observed using an electroencephalogram, EEG) have attracted
a significant deal of attention [1]. Using EEGs evoked by a
stimulus is far more effective than using spontaneous ones.
However, that stimulus must be unperceivable by human
beings. If a perceivable stimulus is given to a user while he/she
is using a system, it disturbs system usage.
Nakanishi et al. proposed using an image in a moving
picture with a high frame rate as an invisible stimulus [2]
and ultrasound as an inaudible stimulus [3]. In this study,
the authors measured the EEGs in the participants while they
were given unperceivable vibration stimuli and examined the

inducibility and individuality of the measured EEGs on the
basis of a t-test using spectral content ratios in θ, α, and β
wavebands. In addition, the verification performance of the
EEGs using the content ratios as an individual feature was
evaluated on the basis of Euclidian distance matching.
II. P ERSON V ERIFICATION U SING EEG S E VOKED BY
U NPERCEIVABLE V IBRATION S TIMULI
The use of brainwave as biometrics has previously been
studied [1]. Electrical time variations from a large number of
synapses (neurons) in the cerebral cortex are accumulated and
then detected as a brainwave on the scalp using an electrode. In
other words, brainwaves are never detected without placing an
electrode on the scalp; therefore, this method is more secure
than other conventional biometrics. Once the electrodes are
placed on the scalp of the user, the user is no longer conscious
of them. This is suitable for continuous authentication.
Brainwaves are categorized as either spontaneous or evoked.
Spontaneous brainwaves always occur independently of a
specified event. Person authentication using spontaneous brainwaves has been widely studied, and the use of evoked responses in brainwaves as biometrics has also proposed [4].
Evoked brainwaves are those that result from an endogenous
or exogenous stimulus. If there are more individualities in
the induced brainwaves, they are expected to obtain a higher
verification performance compared to those use spontaneous
brainwaves.
In this study, the authors assume continuous system user
authentication. In this case, the stimulation must be unperceivable to the users since a perceivable stimulus disturbs
their continuous use of the system. Unperceivable stimulation
is defined as a stimulation that is not perceivable but is
presented practically to the users. Any responses are detected
by the sensory organs and then transmitted to the brain. Person
authentication using unperceivable visual and audible stimuli
has already been proposed, and it has been confirmed that
responses to these stimuli are different from those received by
perceivable stimulation [2], [3].

The authors of this study propose using unperceivable
tactile stimulation. In the case of using visible and audible
stimulation, there is a space between the origin of the stimulus
(a display or a speaker) and the user, and this influences
their perception. On the other hand, tactile stimulation is
presented directly to the skin; therefore, a direct and stable
response in brainwaves is expected. However, no research
on brainwaves evoked by unperceivable tactile stimulation
has been undertaken. Before evaluating the authentication
performance, it is necessary to confirm whether any response
is evoked by unperceivable tactile stimulation.
In general, “tactile” refers to cutaneous (skin) sensation such
as touch, pressure, pain, and temperature. Cutaneous receptors
in the skin feel these sensation and then yield senses. Tactile
stimulation is a collective term for pressure, temperature,
vibration, and electrical stimulation. In this study, the authors
used a vibration to stimulate the palm using a vibrational
actuator.
Figure 1 shows a device for applying tactile stimulation,
in which a vibrational stimulus is generated by a vibrational
actuator (square one in Fig. 1) and two transparent acrylic
poles are the guide for fixing the actuator position on a palm.
A palm is put on the device and a long finger is placed between
the two poles, with the interdigital areas of both sides of the
finger touching the poles. The drive voltage of the actuator
used in this study was 5V and the pulse width was 200µs. The
interval between pulses can be controlled as a vibration cycle
(frequency). The stimulation was very weak; therefore, it is
assumed to have little influence on the human body. However,
the degree of influence is an area for future research.
There are four sensory receptors, Merkel cells, Ruffini
corpuscles, Meissner corpuscles and Pacinian corpuscles, with
different sensation thresholds of vibration frequency [5]. The
authors, therefore, prepared unperceivable vibration stimuli
whose frequencies were a little higher than these thresholds.
First, the authors investigated the sensation thresholds in
the participants. There were 20 participants, all of whom
were males. The number of measured data per participant was
15. While increasing the vibration frequency by 10Hz, the
participant were required to show some response when they
sensed the vibration. Figure 2 shows the sensed frequency
bands of all the participants. The sensation threshold of each

participant differed because the thickness and hardness of skin
in each individual were different [6].
Second, the authors statistically calculated a 95% confidence
interval among the sensed frequencies of each participant. The
confidence intervals are indicated as vertical bars in Fig. 2.
Finally, the authors added 50Hz to the upper limit of the
95% confidence interval, which resulted in a personalized
vibration frequency for each individual; this is indicated as a
red box in Fig. 2. It is assumed that a vibration stimulus with
such a frequency is not perceived by a participant but is at
least received by his cutaneous receptors, evoking a response
in his brainwaves.
III. M EASUREMENT AND F EATURE E XTRACTION
The brainwave sensor used was Epoc+ (Emotiv Co., Ltd.,),
which contains 14 electrodes. The sampling rate was 128Hz
and the frequency range was 0.2–45Hz.
The participants were seated in a chair in a relaxed position
with their eyes closed and earplugs inserted to avoid stimuli
other than the vibrational stimulus. Individual unperceivable
vibration frequencies were presented to each participant. In
addition, assuming the spoofing attack, the participants were
given vibrations whose frequencies had been personalized for
others.
Each measurement took 30 s. 10 personal vibration frequency measurements were taken, and 19 measurements using
others’ vibration frequencies were recorded, yielding a total of
29 measurements per participant. In the case of the personal
vibration frequency, the participants were asked, after the
measurement had been taken, whether they could perceive the
vibration; if so the measured EEG was eliminated.
After all measurements had been taken, all EEGs were
passed through a band pass filter with a passband of 4–43Hz.
In addition, elimination of spike noises was performed. A
statistical variance σ was calculated from all amplitudes of an
EEG; when the absolute value of each amplitude was larger
than ±3σ, it was replaced by a value of 0.
It was impossible to extract individual features directly from
the measured EEGs; therefore, the authors used fast Fourier
transform (FFT) for their frequency analysis. The measured
30 s long EEGs were transformed by FFT to power spectra.
Power-spectral elements were accumulated in θ (4–8Hz), α
(8–13Hz), and β (13–43Hz) wavebands, and the ratio against

vibration frequency was 160Hz. In addition, the authors used
a paired t-test between a content ratio using unperceivable
stimulation and one with no stimulation, which corresponds
to the spontaneous brainwave case.
When two samples from an identical subject are compared,
the paired t-test is defined by

the total spectral power in all bands (4–43Hz) was calculated
in each band. In this paper, the ratio is called the content ratio
and is used as an individual feature.
Examples are shown in Figs. 3 and 4; the names of the
horizontal axes indicate the electrodes’ positions. Figure 3
shows the content ratio of a participant when presented a
stimulus with his vibration frequency, whereas in Fig. 4, the
content ratios when vibration frequencies were applied to
other participants are shown. These results show that the
content ratios of a user are different from those of others when
presented by his vibration. The content ratio is expected to be
an individual feature.
IV. t- TEST
The authors evaluated the inducibility and individuality of
the measured EEGs using a t-test, which is based on a simple
assumption that if averages of two groups are equal, they
are identical. A statistical probability of correctness of this
assumption is obtained and called significance probability (pvalue). If the p-value is less than 0.05, the assumption is
incorrect and the two groups are regarded as not identical.
A. Evaluation of Inducibility
In order to examine whether unperceivable stimulation
evoked responses in the brainwaves, the authors performed
a “paired t-test” between a content ratio using unperceivable
stimulation and one using perceivable stimulation of which

where n, d, and s2 are the number of data, an average, and
an unbiased variance, respectively.
The results of seven typical electrodes are summarized
in Tables I and II. Equivalent results were also obtained
in the remaining seven electrodes. Note that the number of
participants was 10 and there were four measurements for
each stimulation in this evaluation. The colored cells indicate
that the p-value is less than 0.05; that is, the content ratio
using unperceivable stimulation is not identical to that using
perceivable stimulation in Table I and that in the spontaneous
brainwave in Table II.
In these tables, the presence of many colored cells shows
that the characteristics of EEGs obtained by presenting the unperceivable stimulation are different from those obtained when
presenting perceivable stimulation and those in spontaneous
brainwaves. This is an important evidence that the proposed
stimulation method evoked some responses in brainwaves.
B. Evaluation of Individuality
In order to examine the differences in the participants’
EEGs, the authors introduced “Welch’s t-test”, which is used
when two samples are assumed to have different variances and
is defined as
x1 − x2
t= √ 2
,
(2)
s1
s22
n1 + n2
where n is the number of data, x indicates an average and s2
is an unbiased variance in each sample.
In order to increase the number of data in this evaluation,
each 30 s long EEG was divided into six sets of data, each 5
s long. As a result, 60 (6×10) data points from each subject
and 114 (6×19) data points from other participants were used.
The results for seven typical electrodes in α waveband at
each participant are summarized in Table III; the lack of space
means that the results for other wavebands are omitted. The
colored cells indicate that the p-value is less than 0.05. The
number of colored cells is relatively large and suggests that
there is some difference between the evoked EEGs of an
individual and those of others. This is an important evidence
that the proposed personal stimulation results in different
responses in brainwaves.
V. E VALUATION OF V ERIFICATION P ERFORMANCE
The two previous sections confirmed the inducibility and individuality of EEGs evoked by unperceivable vibration stimulation. The authors then evaluated the verification performance
using Euclidian distance matching. As an individual feature,

the content ratio of each brainwave band was used. However,
to increase the number of dimensions of individual features,
β waveband was divided into lower β (13-26Hz) and γ (2643Hz), resulting in four dimensions. Five EEGs were used to
make a template for each participant. The remaining EEGs
were used in the test.
An equal error rate (EER), defined by a cross point where
a false acceptance rate equaled a false rejection rate, was
used as an evaluation index. The EERs at all electrodes are
summarized in Table IV. There was no uniqueness in the

and their inducibilities and individualities were examined and
confirmed using t-test. Finally, the verification performance
using the content ratio in evoked EEGs as an individual feature
was examined using Euclidian distance matching. As a result,
an average EER of all electrodes was approximately 34%.
This indicates the feasibility of person authentication using
unperceivable vibration stimulation. This study has paved the
way for research into other aspects related to the proposed
method. For example, new individual features and learningbased verification methods could be introduced, features or
results from some electrodes could be combined, and the
number of research participants could be increased.

performance is unsatisfactory, but it was achieved using a
simple feature (four content ratios) and Euclidian distance
matching. It is expected that the verification performance will
be improved by introducing other individual features and some
learning-based verification methods.
