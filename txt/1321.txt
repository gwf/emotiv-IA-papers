Abstract
Background: The ability to retrieve specific memories is a cognitive and emotional protective factor. Among the
most effective techniques to generate autobiographical memories is the use of audio-visual stimuli, particularly
images. Developing and improving techniques that facilitate the generation of such memories could be highly
effective in the prevention of depressive symptoms, especially in the elderly population. The aim of the present
study is to examine how the level of personal relevance of pictures as autobiographical memory cues to induce
positive emotions may affect an individual’s emotion regulation.
Methods: The participants, 120 older adults aged 65 and over and 120 young adults aged between 18 and 35, of
both sexes and without depressive symptoms, will be induced to a negative mood state by means of viewing a
film clip. Following the negative mood induction, the participants will be shown positive images according to
experimental group to which they were randomly assigned (high personal relevance: personal autobiographical
photographs; medium personal relevance: pictures of favourite locations associated with specific positive
autobiographical memories; and low personal relevance: positive images from the International Affective Picture
System). We will analyse the differences in subjective (responses to questionnaires) and objectives measures (EEG
signal, heart rate variability and electrodermal activity) between the groups before and after the induction of
negative affect and following the recall of positive memories.
Discussion: The use of images associated with specific positive autobiographical memories may be an effective
input for inducing positive mood states, which has potentially important implications for their use as a cognitive
behavioural technique to treat emotional disorders, such as depression, which are highly prevalent among older
adults.

Introduction
Background and rationale {6a}

The probability of suffering from depression at some
point in one’s life is superior to that of other mental
disorders, such as anxiety, for example [1]. Its
prevalence is elevated, and it is estimated that
between 10 and 20% of the population will develop a
depressive disorder during their lives [2]. Depression
can thus be considered one of the most common
health disorders, especially in older adults, given that
clinically significant depressive symptoms are present
in 15% of community-dwelling older adults [3] and in
46.5% of institutionalized older persons [4]. Depressive symptoms in older adults may be the result of
multiple changes occurring in this life period (e.g. loss
of loved ones, worsening health, social isolation, reduced independence, etc.). A number of authors have
suggested that when older adults are unable to cope
with and adapt to these new circumstances, depressive disorders may appear [5]. Furthermore, depressive
symptomatology in older people is associated with a
higher risk of morbidity, self-neglect, suicide, impaired
physical, social and cognitive functioning, decreased
quality of life and even a higher risk of mortality [3,
6, 7]. Consequently, preventing and mitigating depressive symptoms should be a core element in improving

Fernández et al. Trials

(2020) 21:663

mental health and quality of life in healthy older
adults. For this reason, studies should not be directed
solely towards the development and improvement of
treatments for clinical depression, but also towards
studying variables that can help prevent the appearance of depressive symptoms and/or reduce the presence of non-clinical depressive symptoms in healthy
ageing.
Emotion regulation in ageing and depressive
symptomatology

Depressive symptomatology represents a significant shift
away from the affective balance within which a person
moves, and as such, they are related to problems or
difficulties in emotion regulation. Hence, successful
emotion regulation may increase positive affect and
diminish negative affect [8].
How individuals manage emotions, be they positive or
negative, changes as we grow older, and it has been
suggested that, despite the impairment of cognitive
functioning in ageing, emotion regulation may improve
with age [9]. In the same line, studies have reported a
change in priorities with age, with older adults tending to
focus on positive emotional goals, distancing themselves
from negative information or mood states, generating, in
turn, a positivity effect, whereby the recall of positive
information increases significantly [10], and negative
situations are avoided [11]. An example of this positivity
effect is found in autobiographical memory recall, where
the number of positive memories retrieved tends to
increase with age [12], since, when recalling past events,
older adults typically remember them more positively
compared to young adults [13, 14]. Nonetheless, some
studies have suggested an opposite effect, where the use of
emotion regulation strategies reduces with age [15].
Finally, some authors have even posited that emotion
regulation is unaffected by ageing [16, 17].
Autobiographical memory for positive mood induction

Over the years, different effective emotion regulation
techniques have emerged, with one of the most
significant being the use of autobiographical
memories. These techniques are based on the idea
that individuals are able to regulate negative
emotional mood states using personal episodic
information stored in memory [18]. Various studies
have demonstrated that training access to specific
positive events (referring to something with positive
emotional content that occurred at a concrete
moment in a specific space and time, lasting from
seconds to hours) is effective in regulating emotions
and improving mood state in older adults, reducing
negative mood and increasing positive emotions [19].
Taking these results into account, cognitive

Page 3 of 16

interventions aimed at increasing specific positive
autobiographical memories (e.g. life review [20] or
memory specificity training (MEST) [21]) have been
developed. These therapies have been shown to be a
successful method of reducing depression through
improving autobiographical memory specificity [22].
This mood improvement is even possible after the
induction of a negative mood state [23, 24].
Additionally, a number of studies have also reported
that the ability to retrieve specific autobiographical
memories is an indicator of emotional well-being [25]
and is correlated with enhanced life satisfaction [26].
One of the key types of autobiographical memories is
self-defining memories. Characterized by the vividness
and intensity of their affective tone and related to selfdiscovery, self-understanding and self-images, these
memories help us to create and understand our life story
[27]. Integrating such memories to enrich our selfunderstanding is a predictor of more successful emotion
regulation [28]. In older adults, self-defining memories
are associated with personal maturity, emotion regulation and the creation of meaning [29]. Compared with
younger adults, older people’s self-defining memories
present greater levels of vividness, importance and positive affect, especially with regard to significant relationships, achievements, bringing up children, etc., although
their specificity is lower compared to younger adults’
memories [29].
Autobiographical memories have been used as a
procedure for inducing different mood states, being
especially effective in the induction of positive mood
states [30, 31]. These procedures based on
autobiographical memory recall require participants to
generate the emotion they felt when they experienced
a specific personal event, recalling it as vividly as
possible and re-experiencing sensations, emotions,
perceptions and reactions [32]. El-Ziab posits that the
more accessible and meaningful the autobiographical
memories are for the participant, the more effective
these procedures are in regulating negative mood
[33].
Importance of the use of images in mood induction

As suggested by Holmes and Mathews [34], negative
mood state is typically accompanied by distressing
mental images. In this sense, several studies have shown
that imaging positive events enhances mood more than
verbal processing [35, 36]. These findings have
motivated the development of techniques based on
visual stimuli to reduce these types of symptoms and
generate positive emotions [37]. According to Sitaram
et al. [38], pictures have proven to be one of the most
effective cues for capturing the complexity of an
emotional recall scenario. Their effectiveness might lie

Fernández et al. Trials

(2020) 21:663

in the fact that, compared to other types of stimuli,
images have a direct correspondence to sensory
experience and are thus more real [39], so helping a
person to access emotions related to their
autobiographical memories [40].
Given the importance of autobiographical memory
and images when inducing positive mood states, it
seems necessary to determine what types of pictures
might be more effective in eliciting mood states through
the retrieval of memories related to specific positive
events. A number of studies have reported that viewing
standardized images, such as those taken from the
International Affective Picture System (IAPS) [41], can
activate motives, albeit less strongly than life’s real
transactions, given that the personal relevance or
ecological validity for the participant of such images may
be low [42]. This finding suggests hypotheses related to
the possibility that images with greater personal
relevance for a participant, that is, an individual’s own
photos, might significantly increase the induction of a
positive emotional state.
Objective measurement of emotional response:
physiological correlates

Among the methods most widely used to objectively
assess emotional response are brain activity measurement
(electroencephalogram) and physiological measures, such
as electrodermal activity and heart rate.
Measurement of brain activity Emotions generate
temporal patterns of brain activation [43], which can
be
identified
and
discriminated
using
the
electroencephalogram (EEG) [44, 45].
The use of the EEG signal has facilitated the study
of the neurophysiological correlates through the
amplitude and frequency changes generated in
response to different stimuli (e.g. picture viewing)
[46], enabling different emotional states to be
distinguished. A number of studies have reported that
low frequency bands are associated with emotional
processing [47, 48] and, alpha bands, specifically, are
related to positive emotions [49]. On the other hand,
high frequencies (gamma bands) are relevant to
cognitive processes that include feelings and emotions
[50]. According to Li and Lu [51], these bands are
especially significant for the classification of emotions
using images as stimuli.
Other studies have shown that the left and right
frontal regions are associated with positive and negative
emotional responses, respectively [52]. In the same line,
research has mainly focused on analysing alpha band
asymmetries in the frontal cortex to understand the
hemispheric specialization of emotions [53]. Findings
suggest that, compared with negative emotions, positive

Page 4 of 16

emotions present higher frontal coherence as regards
the alpha and beta bands in the right superior parietal
lobe [54]. Other studies have reported decreased alpha
and theta power in the left frontal region in response to
positive processing, and a decrease in the same bands in
the right frontal region triggered by negative processing,
which suggests band power is associated with the
valence of the stimulus [55].
Marosi et al. [56] found that higher delta
frequencies in left and right frontal, parietal and
temporal regions and high beta frequencies in the left
fronto-temporal and temporal regions are associated
with joy. In addition, higher delta and alpha frequencies appear in response to exposure to pleasant images [46]. These findings corroborate previous studies
finding greater alpha band activity in the left frontal
region during positive emotion processing [57]. Moreover, it has been shown that high arousal stimuli generate a decline in alpha power [58] and increased
delta and theta power [53, 59]. Studies have also revealed that positive stimuli, such as pleasant odours,
happy musical excerpts and pleasant TV commercials,
may induce significantly lower frontal alpha power
and higher theta power in the left hemisphere [60–
62]. Strong synchronization has been found between
theta and delta waves in response to emotional stimuli [48], which suggests that synchronization between
these two brain waves during autobiographical memory tasks may be considered a marker of emotional
arousal [63].
Autobiographical memory has been associated with
a network of predominantly lateralized brain regions,
and thus, mood induction procedures using
autobiographical memory tasks generate bilateral
activation [64]. Specifically, a pattern of left
lateralization during the initial search for general
autobiographical knowledge has been found, while the
subsequent re-experiencing of the memory has been
associated with the right hemisphere, especially the
posterior cortical regions [65], also preferentially associated with emotional processing and social cognitive
processes [66, 67].
Autonomic nervous system As previously mentioned,
emotions involve psychophysiological processes, and
thus generate changes in variables such as heart rate and
blood pressure [68] or galvanic skin response [69].
A number of studies have reported higher heart
rate variability (HRV) in older adults as self-reported
positive emotion and well-being increase [70], with
high HRV being associated with greater emotional
well-being and better emotion regulation [71–73].
Then, the health benefits of positive emotions on
health may derive from reduced cardiovascular

Fernández et al. Trials

(2020) 21:663

activation associated with decreased sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation and an increase in activation of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS)
[74]. Furthermore, positive emotions facilitate cardiovascular recovery following negative emotions [75].
Low heart rate has been associated with pleasant or
relaxed emotional states, while heart rate accelerations
occur in response to intense emotional states, sexual
arousal or mental effort [76].
Furthermore, electrodermal activity (EDA), or galvanic
skin response (GSR), has been associated with SNS
activity [77, 78]. Studies such as that by Codispoti et al.
reported higher skin conductance response to exposure
to emotional pictures [79]. The use of EDA is highly
effective in measuring the level of an individual’s
emotional arousal, regardless of the emotional valence of
the stimuli, since it is able to quantify changes in the
SNS [80]. Various studies have identified changes in
EDA (increase in peaks) following exposure to images
taken from the IAPS [81].

Objectives {7}
The ability to retrieve specific memories is a cognitive
and emotional protective factor. Thus, developing and
improving techniques that facilitate the generation of
such memories, which are able to enhance mood
state, could be highly effective in the prevention and/
or reduction of depressive symptoms in healthy older
adults. Consequently, the aim of the present study is
to delve deeper into the knowledge and effectiveness
of different visual stimuli in inducing positive
emotions and reducing negative emotions, examining
how the level of personal relevance of pictures as
autobiographical memory cues may affect an
individual’s emotion regulation. Importantly, this new
knowledge could also be used in interventions
focused on the training of specific positive memories
with the aim of improving its efficacy in the
treatment of clinical depression in the elderly
population.
Additionally, given the differences in emotion
regulation between young and older adults, we aim to
assess whether the influence on emotion regulation of
the level of personal relevance of the images differs
according to a person’s age.
The main aim of this study, then, is to experimentally
evaluate how the level of personal relevance of the
images used as stimuli to access specific positive
autobiographical memories can improve emotion
regulation, especially in older adults. From this primary
aim, we derive the following specific objectives:
1) To experimentally study the impact of the personal
relevance of pictures on the improvement of mood

Page 5 of 16

state, following negative mood induction. To this
end, we will use three types of images, classified
according to their personal relevance: (a) personal
autobiographical photographs (high personal
relevance), (b) images of locations related to the
participants’ lives (medium personal relevance) and
(c) images from the IAPS (low personal relevance).
Additionally, as suggested by Talarico et al. [82],
events remembered with a high sense of reliving
induce stronger emotions. For this reason, we will
also examine the degree of reliving in the
autobiographical memories evoked by the three
types of images.
2) To analyse any age-related differences in the effectiveness of the use of the three types of images to
regulate emotion. We will compare the efficacy of
the three categories of pictures (high, medium and
low relevance) in inducing positive mood states in a
group of young adults and a group of older adults.
The objective measures of emotion (EEG, EDA and
HRV) will be used to substantiate the effects of emotion
induction mechanisms observed in self-evaluations.

Trial design {8}
This is an exploratory randomized controlled study
designed to compare the effectiveness of three types of
autobiographical stimuli, classified according to their
level of personal relevance, in the induction of positive
emotions resulting from the retrieval of specific positive
autobiographical memories. The study sample will
comprise a group of adults aged 65 years and over and a
group of young adults aged between 18 and 35. Each
participant will be randomly assigned to one of three
parallel groups (high, medium and low personal
relevance images). The allocation ratio will be 1:1:1.
Methods: participants, interventions and
outcomes
Study setting {9}

The study sample will comprise a group of healthy
adults aged 65 years or over and a group of healthy
young adults aged between 18 and 35. The first
group will consist of adults aged 65 years or over,
recruited in the city of Albacete (Spain) from senior
citizens’ associations and centres, from a cultural
association for older people (Alumni Association of
the University of Experience [Asociación de Alumnos
de la Universidad de la Experiencia, ALUEX]), from
the José Saramago University Programme for older
adults and from different socio-cultural centres. The
second group will comprise young adults, aged between 18 and 35 years, who will be recruited from

mood and emotion induction studies. For this reason, its
selection as comparator is justified.

Eligibility criteria {10}

Screening phase The first screening phase will be
conducted with all the potential participants, both young
and older adults. The screening phase will take place in
different sessions in the different recruitment centres
until the minimum necessary number of participants is
achieved. The sessions will be conducted in both group
and individual formats. The instruments described in
the corresponding section will be administered and
individuals not meeting the inclusion criteria will be
excluded from the study.

All participants interested in the study will be asked to
complete preliminary questionnaires to assess their
eligibility before being assigned to the experimental
groups.
Participation will be dependent on the following
inclusion criteria:
1) Older adults will present no symptoms of cognitive
impairment. The self-administered Test Your Memory (TYM) will be used to assess cognitive performance [83, 84].
2) Absence of depressive symptomatology, which will
be assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes
Measurement Information System-Depression [85].
3) Given the high comorbidity between anxiety and
depression [86, 87], it was decided that both young
and older participants should present no symptoms
of anxiety. This will be assessed using the PatientReported Outcomes Measurement Information
System-Anxiety [85].
4) No sensory deficits that might impact performance
in the experiment and the psychological tests.
5) Sufficient literacy skills to understand the
instructions for the experiment and the
psychological tests.
6) Signed informed consent.
Who will take informed consent? {26a}

Two trained research psychologists will present the trial
to possible participants. Participants will then receive
information sheets and any questions about the study
will be resolved. Finally, research psychologists will
obtain written consent from those willing to participate
in the trial.
Additional consent provisions for collection and use of
participant data and biological specimens {26b}

Not applicable. Participant data will not be used for
purposes that are separate from the main trial.
Interventions
Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b}

The conditions of medium and high personal relevant
images will be compared with IAPS images (low
personal relevant condition). IAPS [41] is traditionally
considered a valid system for affectively eliciting stimuli
that can be used as a representative tool, for example, in

Intervention description {11a}

Pre-experimental phase The participants from both
groups (older adults and young adults) will be randomly
assigned to one of the three experimental groups, the
condition of which will differ according to the type of
stimulus used to elicit specific positive autobiographical
memories: (1) low personal relevance condition: positive
images taken from the International Affective Picture
System [41]; (2) medium personal relevance condition:
pictures of places related to the participants’ lives (the
most important or characteristic places in their town or
city, or a place they have visited, etc.); and (3) high
personal relevance condition: participants’ own
photographs related to their positive autobiographical
experiences (see Fig. 1).
We will thus have three types of images varying in
their level of personal relevance for each participant.
The first type of images is pictures taken for the
standardized IAPS. There will be a total of 40 pictures
selected by the research team according to their level of
positive valence (emotional valence values between 7.03
and 8.34). The participants will be asked to choose the 6
photos that best enable them to generate a specific
positive autobiographical memory.
The second type of images used will be photos of
locations and places that are significant for the
participant, which will be selected following a prior
interview in which the participant will be asked to name
places that evoke specific positive autobiographical
memories. These images will be taken from the Internet.
We will select various images of each location, giving
participants the opportunity to choose the one which
best fits their memory.
The third type of images will be autobiographical
photographs selected by participants from their own
collection. Participants will be asked to previously select
six photos, for which they can recall the exact moment
they were taken and which are related to events that
have made them feel happy during their lives. These six

Fernández et al. Trials

Fig. 1 Randomization phase

events will be those they are asked to recall in the
experimental task.
For each of the memories retrieved in the three
conditions, the following factors will be assessed: (1) the
degree of nostalgia generated by the memory; (2) the
intensity of the positive emotion evoked by the memory;
(3) whether the participant was a spectator in the event
(“as if I were watching a film”) or an actor (“as if I were
seeing it with my own eyes or recording it”); (4) the
significance of the event in the person’s life; (5) personal
growth since the event occurred; (6) belief that the event
has led them to better understand themselves and what
life means; and (7) belief that they have learnt more
about what life means as a result of the event.

Experimental phase The experimental phase (see Fig. 2)
comprises the three previously described experimental
conditions. During the experimental task, the
participants will be wearing the devices described in the
instruments section to measure electrophysiological
signals. The experiment will be conducted in a
controlled environment, which will be comfortable and
noiseless, and where the temperature and humidity in
the room will be controlled. The researcher will leave
the room at the beginning of the experiment to avoid
any possible conditioning.

At the start of the experiment, all the participants will
be asked to complete the PANAS mood state scale [88].
This scale will be completed on three occasions: at the
start of the task, following the negative mood induction
(viewing the film clip) and after the autobiographical
memory task (presentation of images according to the
assigned experimental condition).
After completing the PANAS [88], the negative mood
induction phase will begin. The participants will watch a
7-min section of the film “Dead Man Walking” (Polygram Filmed Entertainment, Havoc, Working Title
Films), which shows the execution of a prisoner sentenced to death. Before seeing the film clip, the participants will be encouraged to experience the feelings
generated by the clip as intensely as possible. After viewing the film clip, they will be asked to answer the control
questions related to their level of concentration while
watching the clip, and the degree to which they surrendered to the feelings it generated. They will then be
asked to complete the PANAS [88] again in order to assess the effectiveness of the negative mood induction
procedure.
Following the negative mood induction phase, the
emotional recovery phase will be initiated, in which the
participants will look at a total of six pictures previously
selected according to their experimental condition in
order to generate specific positive autobiographical

emotional recovery was not effective, the psychologist
responsible for the session, using the appropriate
psychological techniques, will be responsible for the
individual having recovered the emotional state previous
to the start of the experimental session.
Outcomes {12}

Participants will first complete a sociodemographic
questionnaire to collect data on the following variables:
age, sex, educational level, current occupation, marital
status relationship status, health problems, regular
medication and self-perceived health status. Additionally,
participants will be asked to complete a series of screening questionnaires.

memories. Each image will be presented for 1 min, and
during this time, the participants will be asked to
concentrate as hard as they can on the memory that
each picture evokes with the aim of reliving the positive
emotions they felt at that moment as intensely as
possible. After each picture, the participants will answer
a series of control questions related to their level of
concentration while looking at the pictures and to what
extent they were able to relive the emotions they felt at
the moment related to the images. At the end of this
phase, participants will once more complete the PANAS
[88] in order to assess the effectiveness of the emotional
recovery.

Test Your Memory (TYM [83], Spanish adaptation
[84]) The TYM is a cognitive screening test to detect
Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment. It
consists of a set of 10 tasks, with a possible total score of
50 points. The following abilities are measured:
orientation, ability to copy a sentence, semantic
information, calculation, verbal fluency, similarities,
confrontation naming and perception. The help required
is scored on a 0–5 range, where 5 is no assistance at all.
The higher the score obtained, the better is the
performance. The cut off for cognitive impairment is 40
or below and 36 or below for dementia. The Spanish
version has demonstrated adequate psychometric
properties (α = .86) [84].
Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information
System-D (PROMIS®-Depression 4ª, short form) [85]
This version includes four items to measure a
participant’s negative affect in the past 7 days, with five
response options ranging from 1 = never, to 5 = always,
where the higher the score, the greater is the negative
affect. The test forms part of PROMIS-29, and total
scores range between 4 and 20, where the highest scores
correspond to more serious depressive symptoms [89].

Fernández et al. Trials

(2020) 21:663

The cut off is set at 11 points (http://www.helathmeasures.net). Indices of reliability for this version are excellent (α = .96).
Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information
System-A (PROMIS®-Anxiety 4a, short form) [85] This
version includes four items to measure symptoms of
anxiety in the past 7 days with five response options
ranging from 1 = never, to 5 = always, where the
higher the score, the higher is the anxiety. It forms
part of PROMIS-29, and total scores range between 4
and 20, where the highest scores correspond to the
most severe symptoms of anxiety [89]. The cut off is
set at 11 points (http://www.healthmeasures.net).
Indices of reliability for this version are excellent
(α = .96).
Mood state measures

Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) [88]
This scale is composed of two 10-item subscales that
measure the primary dimensions of mood state (positive
affect and negative affect). The items describe adjectives
associated with common feelings and emotions and are
scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1
(very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely). The test provides separate scores for the two types of affect, and an
affective balance score can be obtained by subtracting
the negative affect score from that for positive affect
[90], meaning that the higher the score, the greater is
the predominance of positive affect. The validated version for Spanish population [91] has obtained alpha coefficients between .87 and .91.
Measurement of emotional experience in the experiments

Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) [92] This test
measures five sub-dimensions (5 figures per dimension):
(a) affective valence, pleasure or hedonism (SAM-Val),
with manikins that range from smiling and happy to
frowning and unhappy; (b) arousal or activation (SAMAct), ranging from a wide-eyed figure to a sleepy one;
and (c) dominance or controlled emotion (SAM-Dom),
where the figures range from a small manikin indicating
minimum control to a large, impassive figure. As the instrument requires no use of language, it is free of cultural influences and is thus adequate for use in different
countries and cultures.
Control questions

Control questions following negative mood induction
To measure the participant’s level of immersion in the film
clip used for negative mood induction, the following

Page 9 of 16

questions are used: (1) On a scale from 0 to 9, indicate your
level of concentration while watching the film clip (0 = no
concentration; 9 = total concentration), and (2) on a scale
from 0 to 9, indicate to what degree you surrendered to the
feelings generated by the film clip (0 = I did not surrender at
all to the feelings in the film clip; 9 = I surrendered totally to
the feelings in the film clip).
Control questions following exposure to the pictures/
photographs To assess the extent to which the
participant felt involved in viewing the images chosen to
elicit positive affect, the following questions are
included: (1) On a scale from 0 to 9, indicate your level
of concentration when recalling the event (0 = total lack
of concentration; 9 = total concentration), and (2) on a
scale from 0 to 9, indicate to what degree you were able
to relive the positive emotions you felt at the moment of
the event (0 = I was unable to relive the emotions; 9 = I
was able to relive the emotions completely).
Devices used to acquire physiological signals and
behavioural data

Brain Computer Interface (BCI) BCI systems are able to
detect, process and respond to affective states by means of
physiological signals [93] and the analysis of frequency bands
associated with such emotional states. EEG data will be
obtained wirelessly using the EMOTIV Epoc+ (http://www.
emotiv.com/epoc), which is formed by 14 electrodes, divided
into sensors and two reference electrodes placed across both
hemispheres. The electrodes are labelled according to the
International 10-120 positioning system (AF3, F7, F3, FC5,
T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, AF4 and the reference
electrodes P3 and P4).
Empatica E4 This device records heart rate and
electrodermal activity signals (http://www.empatica.com/
en-eu/research/e4/). It is a wireless device able to
measure variables such as heart rate variability, interbeat
interval, electrodermal activity, acceleration and skin
temperature (HRV, IBI, EDA, ACC, TMP, respectively).
It is one of the most efficient devices in the field and is
certified by the US Food and Drugs Administration for
medical use.
Software E-PRIME 3.0 This system allows psychological
experiments to be designed, generated and reproduced
and also records the experimental data and enables the
data to be edited and analysed. It can play films and
videos, digitally record participants’ sonic responses and
can also be integrated with other equipment, such as
EEG devices. It will be used to design the experimental
task and collect and analyse the subjective data.

Participant timeline {13}

Participant recruitment is expected to begin in October
2020 and continue for 2 months. Nevertheless, if the
minimum number of participants in each experimental
group is not reached in early December, the recruitment
period will be extended until the required minimum is
reached. In this phase, those who agree to participate
will complete the screening questionnaires.
The pre-experimental and experimental phases will
take place 7–21 days after randomization. Both phases
will take place on the same day. In the pre-experimental
phase, participants will select the images to be displayed
in the experimental task according to the group to which
they are assigned (low, medium or high personal relevance).
Finally, in the experimental phase, they will complete the
mood questionnaires and the experimental task.
Sample size {14}

This study requires a sample of 120 participants aged 65 or
older (divided into three groups of 40) without cognitive
impairment or major depressive disorder, and 120 young
adults aged between 18 and 35 (divided into three groups of
40) with no major depressive disorder.
To calculate the sample size, we used GPower version
3.1., considering the following parameters: a 95%
confidence interval (p < .05), an estimated power of 95%,
a predicted medium effect size of 0.06 (partial eta
squared; Cohen [94]), 6 repeated measures (6 pictures),
an expected correlation between of .80 and 6
experimental groups (3 types of pictures × 2 age groups).
Recruitment {15}

People interested in participating in this study will be
provided with a detailed information sheet supplemented

X

with a verbal explanation of the study procedure. If the
participants agree with this information, the screening
questionnaires will be completed. The research psychologists
will obtain the informed written consent of each participant
prior to the screening phase. The questionnaires in this
phase will include a complete sociodemographic history, a
screening test to assess the presence of cognitive impairment
and scales to measure anxiety and depression symptoms. Of
these individuals, all participants meeting the inclusion
criteria will be recruited for the study. Recruitment will
continue until the minimum number of participants in each
group is reached.
Assignment of interventions: allocation
Sequence generation {16a}

The online software Randomizer version 3.0 [95] will be
used to randomly assign 40 participants to each of the
three experimental conditions within each group (young
and older adults). The random assignment will be
conducted by a third party in order to ensure the
researcher remains blind to the study.
Concealment mechanism {16b}

Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three
groups (high, medium and low personal relevance
images) with a 1:1:1 allocation as per the online software
Randomizer version 3.0 [95]. Allocation concealment
will be ensured as the randomization code will not be
released until the participant has been recruited into the
study, which takes place after all baseline measurements
have been completed and after verifying that the
inclusion criteria for participation are met and that
informed consent has been provided.

Implementation {16c}

Data management {19}

All patients who give consent for participation and meet
the inclusion criteria will be randomized.
The random assignment of participants will be
conducted by a member of the Psychology Department
blinded to the objectives of the study. This staff member
will send a third research psychologist a list with the
random assignation of each participant to each
intervention group. This psychologist will not be
involved in the recruitment of participants or in
assessing the outcomes of the study. The psychologists
responsible for participant recruitment will not be
allowed to receive information about group allocation.
Throughout the study, the randomization will be
conducted by the same member of the Psychology
Department in order to keep the data management and
the statistician blind to the study condition. Thus,
randomization will be conducted without any influence
from the researchers involved in the study.

Data from the screening phase will be entered and kept
in a SPSS file by the research psychologists responsible
for the data collection in this phase.
In the experimental phase, subjective questionnaires
will be answered using e-prime software. This data will
be added to another SPSS file. The same procedure will
be conducted with the objective measures (heart rate
variability, electrodermal activity and EEG), once these
signals have been processed. All participants will receive
the same identification in all SPSS files (screening, subjective measures and objective measures).
The psychologists responsible for the data analysis will
merge the SPSS files to create a single SPSS file
including all the data.
Participant files will be stored in numerical order in a
secure and accessible place and manner. These files will
be held in storage for a period of 3 years after
completion of the study.

Assignment of interventions: blinding
Who will be blinded {17a}

The
psychologists
responsible
for
participant
recruitment will be blinded to the information about
group allocation. Due to the nature of the intervention,
neither participants nor psychologists responsible for the
experimental phase can be blinded for the allocation,
but the psychologist will be trained to reduce her
influence on the participants as much as possible. To
this end, she will be provided with clear steps and norms
to follow during the experimental intervention.
Procedure for unblinding if needed {17b}

Unblinding should not be necessary in this study.

Data collection and management
Plans for assessment and collection of outcomes {18a}

Each psychologist participating in the data collection
will be trained in the study requirements and the steps
and specific norms to follow while the questionnaires
and experimental tasks are administered.
A detailed description of the study instruments and their
validity can be found in the outcomes section. The informed
consent form and sociodemographic questionnaire are
included in Additional files 1 and 2, respectively.
Plans to promote participant retention and complete
follow-up {18b}

Not applicable. The experimental intervention is
performed in a single session, so it is not necessary to
develop techniques to promote participant retention and
complete follow-up.

Confidentiality {27}

All the study-related information will be stored securely
at the study site. All participant information will be
stored in locked file cabinets in areas with limited access.
All questionnaire forms will be identified only by a
coded ID (identification) number in order to maintain
participant confidentiality. All records containing names
or other personal identifiers will be stored separately
from study records identified by a code number. All databases will be secured with password-protected access
systems. Lists that link participant ID numbers to other
identifying information will be stored in a separate,
locked file in an area with limited access.
Participants’ study information will not be released
outside the study without their written permission.
Plans for collection, laboratory evaluation and storage of
biological specimens for genetic or molecular analysis in
this trial/future use {33}

Not applicable. This trial does not use biological
specimens.

Statistical methods
Statistical methods for primary and secondary outcomes
{20a}
Statistical analysis of the subjective variables

All analyses will be conducted using SPSS24.0 software.
Firstly, ANOVAs and chi-square tests will be conducted to
determine whether significant differences exist between the
different intervention groups for the variables collected
(PROMIS and PANAS scales) in the first assessment phase
(Time 1) and for the level of immersion when viewing the
film clip during the negative mood induction. If differences
between groups are found in any of these variables, the

Fernández et al. Trials

(2020) 21:663

variables with statistically significant differences will be included as covariate variables in the following ANOVAs. Secondly, to assess the impact of personal relevance of the
images in emotional recovery, a repeated-measures ANOVA
and post hoc Bonferroni tests will be performed in a mixed
design with type of image (low, medium and high personal
relevance groups) and group (young and older) as betweensubjects variables and time (pre-test—Time 1—, postnegative emotional induction—Time 2—and post-positive
emotional induction—Time 3) as within-subject variables. Finally, to assess the sense of reliving for the three groups of
images, a repeated-measures ANOVA and post hoc Bonferroni tests will be performed in a mixed design with type of
image (low, medium and high personal relevance groups)
and group (young and older) as between-subjects variables
and (average score of concentration level recalling the events
and average score of the degree of reliving the positive emotions of the remembered events) as within-subject variables.
Processing and statistical analysis of objective variables

Heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal
activity (EDA)
a) Data processing
Cardiovascular and electrodermal activity variables will
be measured through blood volume pressure (BVP) and
skin conductance, respectively, using the Empatica E4
device. Alternations of the BVP waveform are highly
correlated with heart ventricular depolarization and
repolarization, thus being suitable to measure heart
rhythm [96]. BVP and SC will be recorded at a sampling
rate of 100 Hz and 4 Hz, respectively. Once data are
acquired, BVP and SC signals will be processed to
reduce noise. To avoid noise, different filters will be
applied to both signals. Specifically, for the BVP signal,
baseline drift will be removed by carrying out a 0.5-Hz
cut-off-high-pass, linear phase finite impulse response
(FIR) filter. Then, a 30-Hz cut-off low-pass, linear-phase
FIR filter will be used to eliminate high-frequency noise
and power-line interferences. Additionally, peaks related
to pulse pumping will be located on BVP signals using a
robust and reliable peak detection algorithm, capable of
dealing with movement artefacts and signal morphologies [97]. Finally, interbeat intervals (IBIs) will be derived
from the peak-data series.
Related to the SC signal, SC morphology is the result
of two independent components: a fast-changing skin
conductance response (SCR), overlapped with a slowly
changing skin conductance level component (SCL). The
SCL component ranges from 0 to 0.05 Hz, while SCR
ranges from 0.05 to 1.5 Hz. Each SC signal will be filtered by applying a 1.5-Hz cut-off low-pass FIR filter to
decrease noise generated during the acquisition.

Page 12 of 16

Regarding heart rhythm, the IBI data series will be
transformed to obtain the heart rate (HR) measured in
beats per minute (BPM). Then, the HR metric will be
partitioned into 5-s equally separated segments. Finally,
the mean HR will be stored and used subsequently in
the statistical analysis. A similar procedure will be carried out with the SC processed series. The data series
will first be divided into equal segments lasting 5 s, and
the mean of each segment will be recorded for subsequent analysis.
b) Data analysis
We will calculate the mean SCL and HR values
recorded for 4 min before the start of the negative mood
induction procedure. These will be compared with the
maximum scores obtained in the experimental phases
(negative mood induction—viewing film clip—and
emotional recovery using images). Independently for
SCL and HR variables, repeated-measures ANOVA and
post hoc Bonferroni tests will be performed in a mixed
design with group (low, medium and high personal relevance groups) as between-subjects variable and time
(pre-test—Time 1; post-negative emotional induction—
Time 2; and postpositive emotional induction—Time 3)
as within-subject variables.

EEG signal
a) Data processing
The EEG recordings will be analysed off-line using
custom software written in MATLAB. This custom software will be based on EEGLAB tools [98]. EEG functions
will be used to clean the EEG-data. The EEG data will
be segmented based on the event types. Fast Fourier
transformation will be applied to an EEG epoch consisting of the time windows of 30 s each after the onset of
the stimulus (film and images). Fourier transformed signals will then be averaged across event types. For further
analysis, left frontal (F3, F7, FC5) and right frontal (F4,
F8, FC6) electrode pools will be formed by averaging the
frequency distributions of these signals. The mean magnitude of delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta (4.5–7.5 Hz), alpha (8–
12.5 Hz), beta (13–30 Hz) and gamma (30.5–60 Hz) frequency band activities will be calculated for each participant during each event type.
b) Data analysis
A repeated-measures ANOVA will be performed to
examine the possible effects of the intervention group
(between-subjects variable) and time (within-subject
variable) on the frequency band oscillations from frontal

Fernández et al. Trials

(2020) 21:663

electrodes and on laterality (left vs right) by also examining the frequency band oscillations.
Interim analyses {21b}

Not applicable. Given the characteristics of the study,
potentially serious outcomes are not expected in the
trial. For this reason, it is not necessary to develop
guidelines to finish prematurely the trial due to adverse
effects.
Methods for additional analyses (e.g. subgroup analyses)
{20b}

Not applicable. The allocation of the participants to the
experimental groups is random, so it is expected that
there are no differences between groups in relation to
variables such as gender or educational level. In this
sense, and taking into account the characteristics of the
trial, it is not expected to have the need to perform
subgroup analyses.
Methods in analysis to handle protocol non-adherence
and any statistical methods to handle missing data {20c}

Missing data (essentially, unanswered items from the
screening measures) will be handled using a multiple
imputation approach. This approach is based on the
creation of a set of imputations for the respective
variables with missing data. To this end, we will use a
set of repeated imputations created by predictive models
based on the majority of participants with complete
data. After the imputations are completed, all of the data
(complete and imputed) will be combined and the
analysis performed for each imputed and completed
dataset. Rubin’s method of multiple imputation will be
used to estimate effects. We propose to use 100 datasets.
Plans to give access to the full protocol, participant leveldata and statistical code {31c}

No later than 2.5 years after completion of the data
collection, we will deliver a completely deidentified data
set to an appropriate data archive for sharing purposes.

Oversight and monitoring
Composition of the coordinating centre and trial steering
committee {5d}

Not applicable. Given the characteristics of the study,
there is no need for a data monitoring committee.
Composition of the data monitoring committee, its role
and reporting structure {21a}

Not applicable. This trial shows no minimal risks, and it
is short duration. For these reasons, there is no need for
a data monitoring committee.

Page 13 of 16

Adverse event reporting and harms {22}

Not applicable. It is not expected that the experimental
intervention to produce negative effects. However, if
after the phase of negative emotional induction, the
intervention aimed at their emotional recovery was not
effective, the psychologist responsible for the session,
using the appropriate psychological techniques, will be
responsible for the individual having recovered the
emotional state previous to the start of the experimental
session.
Frequency and plans for auditing trial conduct {23}

Periodic meetings of all investigators will be established
every 15 days to review processes related to (1)
participant enrolment, consent, eligibility and allocation
to study groups and (2) completeness, accuracy and
timeliness of data collection.
Plans for communicating important protocol
amendments to relevant parties (e.g. trial participants,
ethical committees) {25}

Any modification to the protocol that might influence
how the study is conducted, including changes to the
study objectives, study design, population characteristics,
samples sizes or study procedures, will require a formal
amendment to the protocol. Such amendments will be
approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of
the Castilla-La Mancha Health Service prior to
implementation.
Dissemination plans {31a}

The primary outcome papers of the study will present
outcome data about the effectiveness in emotion
regulation of different levels of personal relevance of
pictures as autobiographical memory cues to induce
positive emotions. Additionally, we may on occasions be
asked to contribute papers to workshops, symposia,
congresses, etc.
The study is expected to end within the planned target
of 2 years after completing data collection. We intend to
reduce to the minimum the interval between the
completion of data collection and the release of the
study results. We expect to take about 4 to 5 months to
elaborate the paper presenting the final results for an
appropriate journal.
The study results will be released to the general
psychology community.

Discussion
The World Health Organization estimates that in 2050 there
will be two billion people aged 65 years or older [99].
Population ageing, especially in developed countries, is an
enormously important issue and is a challenge that heightens
the need to create effective interventions to improve the

Fernández et al. Trials

(2020) 21:663

mental health and quality of life of older persons. These
predicted figures for population ageing also suggest there will
be greater demand for effective alternative preventive
treatments for depression, taking into account its prevalence
in older adults [100, 101].
Emotion regulation is a key factor in adaptive
functioning throughout life, being associated with
cognitive, physical and social health [102]. This study
protocol describes the design of a randomized controlled
trial that aims to analyse how effective different types of
autobiographical stimuli are in inducing positive
emotions, analysing the variables that might enhance
individuals’ emotion regulation for their use in the
prevention of depressive symptoms.
The findings of this study will enhance knowledge of
the functioning of positive mood induction procedures,
which will help to better understand the processes
involved in emotions in ageing and to assess the effect of
ageing on emotional response and regulation and thus,
also on older adults’ well-being. In addition, the results
will lay the foundations for the development of future
interventions designed to facilitate emotion regulation in
both young and older adults, but above all in the latter,
adapting the different techniques to the age group to ensure they are as effective as possible. In this sense, the
knowledge derived from this study might allow individuals to use preventive techniques in their daily life and
in their own homes, and thus the applicability of the
findings will be considerable.

Trial status
The original protocol was finished on December 20,
2019, which is the version to be used in this study.
Participant recruitment is expected to begin in
October 2020 and continue for 2 months. Nevertheless,
if the minimum number of participants in each
experimental group is not reached in early December,
the recruitment period will be extended until the
required minimum is reached.
