ABSTRACT
Introduction Exergames training, as an additional therapy
to standard care, has been widely used for motor recovery
after patients who had a stroke, and it is a valuable and
positive tool in the rehabilitation of this population. This
study describes a single-­blind randomised clinical trial that
will aim to investigate the effects of exergames training on
postural balance in patients with chronic stroke.
Methods and analysis Forty-­two individuals with
chronic stroke (>6 months), aged 20–75 years, will be
randomised into two groups: the experimental group,
which will be subjected to an exergames protocol, and
control group, which will undergo a kinesiotherapy
protocol. Both protocols are based on postural balance.
The intervention will consist of 40-­minute sessions two
times per week for 10 consecutive weeks. The volunteers
will be evaluated before the treatment, at the end of the
interventions and 8 weeks thereafter. The primary outcome
will be postural balance (Berg Balance Scale, Functional
Reach Test, Timed Up and Go test and Centre of Pressure
variables) and secondary outcomes will include gait (6 m
timed walk and Kinovea Software), cortical activation
patterns (electroencephalography Emotiv EPOC), functional
independence (Functional Independence Measure), quality
of life (Stroke-­Specific Quality of Life Scale) and motivation
(Intrinsic Motivation Inventory).
Ethics and dissemination This protocol was approved
by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Rio
Grande do Norte (number 3.434.350). The results of the
study will be disseminated to participants through social
networks and will be submitted to a peer-­reviewed journal
and scientific meetings.
Trial registration number Brazilian Registry of Clinical
Trials (RBR-­78v9hx).

INTRODUCTION
According to the WHO, cerebrovascular
disease was the leading cause of death worldwide in 2016. Of those deaths, 5.78 million
were directly attributed to stroke, making it
the main non‐communicable cause of death.1
In Brazil, stroke resulted in approximately
100 000 deaths in 2014,2 and data indicate that

Strengths and limitations of this study
►► This study will explore objective data of postural

balance and gait through the force platform and kinematic analysis.
►► This study is among the few that use electroencephalography to assess brain activity in stroke individuals undergoing an experimental protocol with
exergames.
►► The results of this research can lead to improvements in the use of exergames for postural balance
in stroke rehabilitation.
►► This study should benefit participants not only in
physical aspects but also in psychological and social
aspects.
►► Blinding of participants will be not possible because
of the nature of the intervention.

approximately 568 000 affected individuals
suffer from severe disability, making stroke
the leading cause of disability in adults.3
Following stroke, various aspects of
balance function are altered, such as delay in
regaining the ability to assume the standing
posture, loss of balance, asymmetry between
the right and left limbs, increased postural
sway and decreased weight bearing on the
affected side.4 5 Postural balance is important
for functional tasks such as sitting, sit-­to-­stand
and walking. Dysfunction leads to alterations
in weight distribution patterns, causing the
paretic leg to take less load.6 These changes
increase the risk of falling, cause difficulties
in executing functional activities and cause
reduction in performance of daily living activities, leading to a consequent reduction in
social participation, which can aggravate the
clinical situation.7
Underuse of the impaired limb results in
suppression of the cortical representation of
the affected limb and further inhibition of its

use.8 The existence of cortical neural resources specialised in capturing changes in postural stability, which have
been detected by changes in electroencephalography
(EEG), supports the idea that postural adjustments are
not only due to muscle responses to disorders but also
due to cortically controlled intentional movements that
may be altered following stroke.9
One major component of stroke rehabilitation is exercise therapy,10 and motor skill learning is particularly
attractive because practice-­
induced improvement of
sensorimotor performance supports the development
of new aptitudes, providing the flexibility to adapt to
changing conditions.11
From this perspective, exergames training has been
widely used in rehabilitation with the aim of improving
sensorial, cognitive, psychological and motor function.12 13 They have been characterised as experiences
that simulate a real environment in which the user can
interact with the scenario created by the game through
the involvement of multisensory aspects.14 Exergames
applications have the potential to apply relevant concepts
of neuroplasticity, such as repetition, intensity and task-­
oriented training of the paretic extremity,7 and may
entrain several brain areas involved in motor planning
and learning, thus leading to an enhanced motor performance in rehabilitation.12 15 16
There are some evidences to suggest the effectiveness of
exergames in improving upper limb function and balance
as an additional therapy to standard care in patients who
had a stroke. Therefore, therapy based on exergames is
a valuable and positive tool for the rehabilitation of this
population.17 18
A meta-­analysis by Lee et al19 found moderate evidence
to support the effect of exergames training on improved
lower limb function, including balance and gait, to a
similar degree as upper limb function in patients who
had a chronic stroke, suggesting that this technique may
be used as a complementary treatment method alongside
traditional rehabilitation therapy. However, most of the
studies in this meta-­analysis increased the overall treatment time by adding exergames training to conventional
treatment, which may be the reason for the observed
outcomes.19
Considering the above evidence, it is paramount to
investigate the isolated effectiveness of exergames rehabilitation and its contributions to positive changes in
postural balance in patients who had a stroke, as this
may provide additional evidence for the rehabilitation
process in this population. From this perspective, it is
hypothesised that training based on exergames improves
postural balance, cortical activation, functionality, quality
of life and motivation of patients who had a chronic
stroke.
The purpose of this study to investigate the effects of
exergames training on postural balance in patients who
had a chronic stroke and to explore changes in cortical
activation patterns, functionality, quality of life and
motivation.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS
Design
A single-­blind randomised controlled clinical trial that
follows the recommendations of the Standard Protocol
Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials20 will
be carried out (figure 1). Participants will be randomised
to receive the exergames protocol (experimental group
(EG)) and kinesiotherapy protocol (control group (CG))
(figure 2).
Participants
The study population will consist of 42 patients who had
a chronic stroke living in the city of Natal or nearby. A
volunteer selection will be carried out at the stroke patient
care centres in the city. The selection can also be carried
out via spontaneous demand by the voluntary search of
patients who had a stroke after project advertisement on
social media. After this, the first telephone contact will be
made to clarify any questions from the participants and
the first screening for inclusion will be performed.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The participants will be selected according to the
following criteria: (1) first episode of unilateral stroke
(ischaemic or haemorrhagic); (2) postural balance deficits (Berg Balance Scale score (BBS))<45)21; (3) injury

numbered opaque envelopes. These envelopes will be
sealed, and the randomisation sequence will be enforced
using colour coding for the study groups (blue and red),
that will correspond to the protocol that will be executed.
The contents of each envelope will be revealed at the
beginning of each patient’s training by the study therapists responsible for the intervention to maintain allocation confidentiality. The same therapists involved in CG
training will perform training in the EG. The researcher
responsible for evaluations will be blinded to all intervention groups. The only variables that will be collected
during the training will be evaluated by the study therapists (non-­blind). Statistical analysis will be performed by
a blind researcher who will treat the groups according to
colour, and the equivalence between groups and colours
will be revealed on completion of the statistical analysis.
The main researcher will have access to the final trial
dataset; this researcher will decide on terminating the
trial. All information about participants will be confidentiality before, during and after the trial.

Sample size
Using an online calculator26 and based on previous study
values (51.0±4.6 and 46.2±5.7),27 a total sample of 42
participants (21 in EG and 21 in CG) will be sufficient
to detect a clinically important difference between the
groups on the BBS. A statistical power of 80%, an alpha of
5% and a loss rate of 10% were considered for the sample
calculation.
Randomisation and blinding
A randomisation sequence will be generated by a
computer28 in 3 blocks of 12 participants and 1 block of
6 participants, allowing participants to be equally distributed between the two groups. This stage will be conducted
by a researcher who is not involved in the study, they will
keep the randomisation list confidential until the end of
the study and will organise the allocation in sequentially

Evaluation procedures
The researchers will be trained before data collection
procedures to ensure reliability of measurements, and
the participants will be submitted to assessment using all
the instruments mentioned below.
Measures
Sample characterisation measures
►► Cognition: The MMSE is a validated instrument in
Brazil used to assess cognitive function. The total
score ranges from 0 to 30 points, and the higher
the score, the better the cognitive ability. Values are
interpreted according to educational status. Good
cognitive status is considered with scores of 24 points
higher for literate persons and 19 or higher for illiterate persons.23
►► Ability to walk: This will be evaluated by the FAC, which
is a sensitive and reliable instrument for gait evaluation in patients who had a stroke with hemiparesis24
and ranks the ability to walk according to the amount
of physical support required for the task. The score
can vary from 0 (unable to walk or needs the help of
two therapists) to 5 (independent in locomotion).
►► Spasticity: The modified Ashworth scale allows the
subjective assessment of muscle tone and classifies the
affected segments from 0 (normal tone) to 5 (rigid
affected part).22
►► Clinical and demographic data: Personal, anthropometric, demographic and pathological data
(including, injury time, paretic side, stroke type), and
clinical history (history of falls, physical therapy treatment and previous use of exergames) will be collected.
►► Neurological impairment: NIHSS is a specific instrument to assess the severity of stroke via 10 items and
has been reported to have excellent validity and
reliability.25

Outcome measures
All outcome measures will be assessed in both intervention groups. The primary outcome measures considered
in this study are as follows:
Postural balance
BBS: It is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring both the static and dynamic aspects of balance
in people after stroke. BBS scores range from 0 to
56, and values below 45 points are predictive of falls,
indicating a significant change in balance.21 29 In the
present study, test scores with the paretic limb positioned behind will be used in item 13 and unipodal
support over the paretic limb will be used in item 14,
minimising the ceiling effect in individuals with better
balance.30
►► Functional Reach Test: It assesses a patient’s stability
by measuring the maximum forward distance an individual can reach while standing in a fixed position. It
is widely used to identify the risk of falling.31 Displacements<15 cm indicate patient fragility and risk of
falls.32
►► Timed Up and Go test: It is a valid instrument for
assessing mobility and functional balance involving
power, speed and agility.33 Performing the test within
10 s is considered normal for healthy, independent
adults without the risk of falls. Values from 11 s to
20 s are expected for disabled or frail elderly people
with partial independence and a low risk of falls.
Values>20 s suggest significant physical mobility deficits and risk of falls.34
►► Centre of Pressure (CoP) variables: Data for total
displacement, anteroposterior and midlateral velocity
of the CoP will be assessed using the gold standard
equipment for balance assessment, the force platform (FP).35 The Bertec model 4060 connected to an
external amplifier (Bertec AM651X) will be used.
The secondary outcome measures considered in this
study are as follows:
►►

Cortical activation pattern
Alpha and beta waves will be evaluated based on their
relationship with the motor learning process,36 using
the Emotiv EPOC portable 14 sensor EEG device, a gyroscope capable of detecting changes in the movement
performed.
Gait kinematic analysis
The spatiotemporal and angular gait variables will be
evaluated using the 6-­metre timed walk test (6MTW) and
Kinovea software.
►► 6MTW: It is a valid and reliable test for the assessment
of the walking ability of patients who had a stroke.37
Gait speed should be self-­
selected and considered
comfortable and usual for the participant. Studies
show variation in mean habitual speed (0.45–0.78
m/s) of gait in individuals with hemiparesis.38 39
4

►►

Software Kinovea: Kinematic evaluation will be
performed during gait video capture (6MTW) using
the Sony DCR-­DVD850 digital camera, 02.7/6.7 cm
LCD (liquid crystal display) screen and 60× optical
zoom. Data will later be exported to Kinovea V.0.8.15
software for paretic lower limb angle and gait speed
analysis. This is a public domain video editing and
analysis software that is valid, reliable and capable of
accurately measuring distances up to 5 m from the
object.40

Functional independence
The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scale is
used because of its reliability, validity, precision and feasibility criteria. It is composed of 18 items, including motor
and cognitive items. Here the patient’s answers are valued
from 1 (total dependent) to 7 (complete independence),
and the total punctuation ranges between 18 and 126. For
this research, the FIM will be applied exclusively to the
motor items, limiting the minimum score to 13 and the
maximum to 91 points.41
Quality of life
Quality of life perception will be assessed through a
quality-­of-­life assessment scale for stroke (Stroke-­Specific
Quality of Life Scale). It is valid and reliable in assessing
the quality of life after stroke in the Brazilian population
and has 49 items distributed over 12 domains.42
Motivation
The Intrinsic Motivation Inventory is a multidimensional
measurement with six subscales used to assess the subjective experiences of participants when developing an
activity and attends to the reliability and validity criteria.
According to the inventory, instruction participants
ranked their agreement with each statement on a Likert
scale of 1 (‘not at all true’) to 7 (‘very true’).43
Participant monitoring measures
Participants will be monitored during interventions using
the following measures:
►► Cardiovascular parameter variables: heart rate (HR)
will be checked using a portable oximeter and blood
pressure using a sphygmomanometer (Visomat
Comfort III, Incoterm, São Paulo, Brazil) on the non-­
paretic arm.
►► Adverse symptoms, perceived effort and pain: information regarding headache, vomiting and dizziness
will be collected. Quantification of perceived effort
and pain will be used as indicators to monitor exercise
tolerance through the CR-10 (Category-­Ratio Scale)
Borg Scale44 modified by Foster et al.45
Adverse events
Additional information such as hospitalisations, falls,
out-­of-­routine medical consultation, medication change,
new diagnosis and the presence of adverse events will be
collected during the follow-­up.

Interventions
The protocols in both groups will be performed individually through 40-­minute sessions two times per week
for 10 weeks (total of 20 sessions), totalling 13 hours of
intervention.12 17 46 The same outcome measures and
motivation will be collected again at the end of the
interventions (post-­training) and after 8 weeks of the
end of the interventions (follow-­up). All participants
will be instructed not to perform any other physical
activity that works on body balance during the study
period.
During each session, absences, manifestations of
adverse symptoms and occurrence of imbalance and/or
falls will be recorded. Interventional modifications will be
performed according to the patient’s level of adaptation
involving optimisation of time or number of repetitions
and/or rest time enlargement, and all will be registered.
Both groups will begin their protocols with adapted
lower limb strength training for 10 min47 48 as described
in table 1. Each exercise should be performed with
respect to the patient’s level of adaptation and evolution
will occur in the 6th and 13th sessions using the materials
described.

Control group
Participants in the CG will receive a kinesiotherapy
protocol (30 min) (table 2), focusing on balance based on
previous studies and that promotes stimuli similar to the
EG, selected so they demand identical motor sensors in
both intervention environments, real and virtual.47–50 Two
progressions will happen, in the 6th and 13th sessions.
Experimental group
Participants in the EG will receive seven Wii Fit Plus
exergames on the Nintendo Wii (30 min) (table 3). This
will use the Wii Balance Board accessory, a multimedia
projector and the Wii Remote Controller. Initially, participants will have a moment to adapt to Nintendo Wii and
its components. It is expected that the participants in this
group will be able to deal satisfactorily with the games
used in the protocol after adaptation. Otherwise, they will
enter the non-­adherence criteria.
The games were pre-­established with focus on balance,
and demands similar to that of the kinesiotherapy
protocol: saccadic stimulation, visuovestibular cephalic
movement, proprioceptive stimulus, dynamic balance
training, static gait, ankle and hip strategies, fine CoP
control, stimulus optokinetic, double task (motor) and

motor coordination.51–53 All scores obtained in games
will be noted. Progression will occur on adaptation of
the patient, two evolutions will occur, in the 6th and 13th
sessions.
Adherence
Participants will be contacted by telephone to confirm
assessment and training sessions to avoid sample loss.
Strategies to improve adherence include making up for
missed sessions and interventions of motivated professionals. Regardless of the protocol, the criteria for non-­
adherence will be considered as follows: (1) absence >30%
of the intervention, consecutively and without make-­up
sessions; (2) presenting persistent pain or severe discomfort (headache, vomiting, dizziness, etc), which prevents
continuity in performing the proposed protocol in
future sessions (or both); (3) presenting haemodynamic
instability: decompensation of systemic arterial pressure
(systolic and diastolic values >200 mm Hg and 110 mm
Hg, respectively)54 and HR above the submaximal values
allowed during the training maintained even after pauses,
calculated by means of the formula (HRsub=0.75 × (220−
age)55) and (4) those who did not adapt to the proposed
intervention.
Data acquisition
For data collection of the CoP variables, six static
balance tests will be performed on the FP based on
their complexity variation and common use in the literature56 57: bipodal support on a stable surface with eyes
open and eyes closed for 30 s each; unipodal support of
paretic limbs on a stable surface with eyes open and eyes
6

closed for 30 s each; unipodal support of non-­paretic limb
on a stable surface with eyes open and eyes closed for
10 s each. The distance between the patients’ feet will be
standardised51 and in unipodal support tasks, the contralateral knee may be slightly flexed and there may be no
contact between the raised and support legs. Each test
can have one successful attempt and a maximum of three
unsuccessful attempts. The attempt is considered invalid
if the participant moves their support leg or touches the
floor with the contralateral leg.58
For gait analysis during 6MTW, the camera will be positioned perpendicular to the plane of motion, at a height
of 1 m and 3 m away from the subject to capture the gait
pattern of the hemiparetic side, and will be considered
as a complete gait cycle. Markers will be placed on the
main bone references of the paretic lower limb (greater
trochanter of the femur, lateral tibial condyle, lateral
fibular malleolus, fifth metatarsal head and lateral calcaneal bone tuberosity) for further analysis.
For encephalographic recording during the FP static
balance and walking tests, the Emotiv EPOC headset
will be positioned on the user’s head according to the
international placement in the 10–20 positioning system
following the manufacturer’s specifications.59
Data processing
The Bertec Model 4060 platform will be synchronised
with Qualisys Motion Capture Systems (Qualisys Medical
AB, 411 13 Gothenburg, Sweden), and through that
system software, Qualisys Track Manager, data for CoP will
be collected and converted to MATLAB compatible files

(Mathworks, Natick, Rhode Island, USA). The sampling
rate will be 40 Hz, and a Butterworth bandpass filter with
a cut-­off frequency of 15 Hz will be applied to eliminate
noise contamination.
For kinematic analysis, the videos will be converted to
an Audio Video Interleave file extension and exported to
Kinovea software. The hip, knee and dorsiflexion flexion
angles will be evaluated in the middle oscillatory phase of
gait, using the following joints: hip, tibiofemoral metatarsophalangeal and calcaneal. Emotiv EPOC data processing
will follow the model used by Oliveira et al.60 The encephalographic recording will take place during gait and static
balance tests, using 10 s of single-­leg support activity and a
central 10 s cutout in bipodal support activities.
Statistical analysis
The SPSS V.21.0 software programme will be used, and
a significance level of 5% and 95% CI will be implemented for all statistical analyses. A descriptive analysis of
the sample characterisation variables will be performed
through central tendency and dispersion measures.
Normality tests (Kolmogorov-­Smirnov) will be used for
outcomes and will be compared between groups within
each training session by using intergroup comparisons, t
tests for independent samples, or Mann-­Whitney U tests.
A mixed analysis of variance with repeated measures will
be used to compare values and variations of outcome
measures, comparing values between groups and between
baseline, post-­training and follow-­up assessments.
The effect size will be calculated using GPower V.3.1.9.3
(University of Dusseldorf, Kiel, Germany). Cohen’s d will
be used to calculate the effect size between the control
and the EG, and the partial η2 for intragroup analyses.61 Intention-­to-­treat analysis will be performed for
dropout data, considering the last data obtained from the
participant.
Risk of bias and study limitation
The present study has a low risk of selection bias due
to randomisation and concealment of the allocation of
participants; low risk of detection bias as the outcome
assessor will be blind; high risk of performance bias
because the participants will not be blind to the proposed
therapies; reporting and attrition biases do not apply
because it is a protocol study.62
The proposed follow-­up time (8 weeks) can be considered a potential (minor) study limitation; it is not verified
whether motor and neurophysiological changes resulting
from the proposed intervention will be maintained over a
long term (1 year). However, it is suggested that the effect
of treatment with Nintendo Wii can be maintained for at
least 2 months after the intervention, with improvements
in motor recovery.
Patient and public involvement
Patients were not involved in the design of this trial, establishing the research question, or developing recruitment
procedures. At the end of the study, the results will be
Bessa NPOS, et al. BMJ Open 2020;10:e038593. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2020-038593

reported to the participants in the form of a lecture,
showing the effects found in the studied variables. The
results of the study will be disseminated to participants
through social networks and will be submitted to a peer-­
reviewed journal and scientific meetings.
Ethics and dissemination
This research was approved by the Research Ethics
Committee of the Federal University of Rio Grande do
Norte, with protocol number 3.434.350 on 3 July 2019.
Participants will be informed of the study objectives, its
risks and benefits and when eligible for inclusion, if they
agree to participate, must sign the informed consent
before the study begins. They will be free to abandon
the study at any time without the obligation to give any
explanation.
There will be prior contact with individuals through
social networks, when all information about the study
will be presented as well as the Resolution No 466/2012
of the Brazilian National Health Council of 2012, which
provides guidelines and standards for research involving
human participants. In case any negative effects occur,
participants who suffer harm from trial participation will
receive physical assistance according to the injury. The
study results will be disseminated to participants through
social networks and will be submitted to peer-­reviewed
journals and scientific meetings.
Protocol amendments
Protocol amendments will be documented with descriptions of the change and the date of the change.
Study status
Subject recruitment is underway, started in November
2019, but the first inclusion was in January 2020. To date,
eight patients were enrolled in the study. The recruitment
period spans till January 2021. The goal is to include 21
patients per treatment group, each patient completing
the rehabilitation programme and evaluation before and
after, and 8 weeks later.
