We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine if posting a “selfie” and receiving
validation from others in the form of “likes” on social media can help narcissists reduce
psychological distress. After all participants completed the narcissistic personality
inventory (NPI) and experienced social exclusion, participants completed an auditory
startle task that elicits the P3 to white noise—an ERP component that reflects emotional
arousal and is sensitive to psychological distress. Participants were then randomly
assigned to either view a personal “selfie” that quickly received a significant number
of ostensibly real “likes” (selfie with likes condition), view a “selfie” with no feedback
(selfie only condition), or view a neutral picture before (neutral picture condition)
completing the auditory startle task again. Results revealed that participants high
on the Leadership/Authority subscale of the NPI in the “selfie” with “likes” condition
demonstrated a pre–post manipulation decrease in P3 mean amplitude, relative to
participants in the other two conditions. These results suggest that approval via social
media can help certain kinds of narcissists alleviate distress from social exclusion.

INTRODUCTION
Social connection is a fundamental psychological need (Leary and Baumeister, 2017). People who
feel connected are healthier, happier, and live longer (for a review, see Hawkley and Cacioppo,
2010). Social exclusion, on the other hand, can cause emotional pain, reduce emotional sensitivity,
increase aggression, and lead to long-term psychological problems (for reviews, see Baumeister
et al., 2007; Williams, 2007). For narcissists, social connection is a particularly thorny problem.
Narcissists prioritize social validation and superiority in social interactions, but have difficulty
forming genuine, close, and stable relationships (Morf and Rhodewalt, 2001; Bergman et al., 2011).
Initially seen as charming, the narcissist’s myopic pursuit of approbation leads others to find the
relationship taxing and one-sided (Campbell and Campbell, 2009). Narcissists can seek short-term
social connections for validation, such as one-night stands and casual sexual relationships (Jonason
and Buss, 2012). However, short-term connections are costly and not reliably rewarding. Thus,
narcissists face a dilemma: social connections are their primary source of validation, but pursuing
these asymmetric relationships may not always be feasible.

regard for others and poor relational functioning (Konrath and
Bonadonna, 2014). Narcissists feel entitled to special treatment
and they owe others little (Millon and Davis, 1996).
Narcissists are particularly sensitive to exclusion. For example,
social exclusion causes narcissists to react more aggressively
toward those who rejected them and even toward uninvolved
third parties (Twenge and Campbell, 2003). On the other hand,
narcissists reliably report higher levels of self-esteem, happiness,
and well-being, leading some researchers to reasonably conclude
that narcissism is psychologically healthy (Sedikides et al.,
2004). Such conclusions contrast sharply with classical views on
narcissism as a compensatory defense against a deeper sense
of insecurity or inferiority (Freud, 1914; Adler, 1939; Horney,
1945/2013; Bowlby, 1988/2012). Would one expect a narcissist
to self-report anything other than cheery prospects and sanguine
psychological states?
Contemporary research using more objective neuroscience
measures support these classical views (see also Millon and
Davis, 1996, for a biosocial approach to narcissism). For example,
in a recent fMRI study, participants viewed pictures of their
own face, a friend’s face, and a stranger’s face. In contrast to
the self-report research on selfies and narcissism cited above
(McCain et al., 2016), results here showed that viewing their
own face caused narcissistic men to demonstrate increased
activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the right
anterior insula, a pattern of activation consistent with negative
affect or emotional conflict (Jauk et al., 2017). This finding
stands in direct contrast to the idea that narcissists find the
self inherently rewarding and points to an implicit sense of
insecurity. Similarly, a diffusion tensor imaging study found that
narcissism is associated with reduced connectivity between the
ventral striatum and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; Chester
et al., 2015). The mPFC has been associated with self-relevant
processing and the ventral striatum is associated with rewardrelated processing. Further, connectivity between these two
regions has been associated with increased positive self-regard
(Chavez and Heatherton, 2014). This suggests that narcissism
also involves a restricted neuroanatomical link between the
self and reward.
In response to social exclusion, narcissism was associated
with increased activation in the putative “social pain” network,
which includes the ACC and the anterior insula (Cascio
et al., 2014). Interestingly, self-report indices did not reveal
any association between narcissism and distress after social
exclusion (Cascio et al., 2014). Moreover, aggressive reactions
to social exclusion characteristic of narcissists are moderated
by the degree of activation in the ACC (Chester and DeWall,
2016). The authors reasoned that the narcissist’s distress was
caused by detection of a discrepancy between the idealized
self and the threatened self. Increased distress then led to
increased aggression among narcissists. In all, these findings
support the notion that narcissists are particularly vulnerable
and highly motivated to defend against social exclusion.
More broadly, these findings demonstrate how neuroscience
measures can directly address the inherent problems in using
self-report to reveal underlying mechanisms in narcissismrelated processes.

However, the ways in which we establish and maintain
relationships has been greatly impacted by social media. Online
platforms afford instant connection with family, friends, and
acquaintances. Social media can be psychologically rewarding.
For example, social media use among people with large social
networks causes a temporary bump in self-esteem (Wilcox and
Stephen, 2012). Additionally, the number of “likes” a photograph
uploaded to Instagram receives is associated with increased
activation in the nucleus accumbens, a brain region integral to
reward-related processing (Sherman et al., 2018).
Could social media have handed narcissists the perfect
solution to their dilemma? That is, might validation through
social media allow narcissists to meet their deep need for social
approval without the effort of real-world relationships? A central
psychological currency on social media is validation. Social
networking sites such as Facebook and Instagram allow users
to enhance their photos using filters and editing tools before
uploading to a potentially global audience who can provide
instant, positive feedback. And the obstacles in establishing and
maintaining genuine connections are avoided. Research shows
that narcissists are particularly active on social media (Buffardi
and Campbell, 2008). Narcissists also report more frequent
“selfie” (i.e., picture of oneself) posting (Barry et al., 2017), higher
levels of self-reported attractiveness in “selfies” (Re et al., 2016),
and increased positive affect when posting selfies, particularly
among those with high levels of grandiose narcissism (McCain
et al., 2016). Social media may thus be an ideal hunting ground
for narcissists to pursue reliable shots of validation. To date,
however, no research has demonstrated that social media serves
a psychological function for narcissists. The present research
examines if people high in narcissism can regulate negative affect
from exclusion through validation from social media.

NARCISSISM, EXCLUSION, AND THE
BRAIN
We focus on narcissism as conceptualized in social-personality
(SP) psychological research—a personality trait that varies
normally across individuals—as opposed to conceptualizations
of narcissism as a personality disorder (Cain et al., 2008).
Trait narcissism is characterized by a grandiose yet fragile selfimage sustained by external validation and approval. Threats
to this self-image cause narcissists to react with increased
anger and aggression (Bushman and Baumeister, 1998). As
part of intrapsychic and interpersonal strategies employed to
attain social approval or superiority, narcissists seek physical
attractiveness, personal success, and social dominance (Campbell
and Campbell, 2009). After receiving social approbation,
however, narcissists become particularly callous, displaying
particularly low levels of empathy (McGregor et al., 2013). At a
trait level, narcissism is associated with high levels of extraversion
and agency and low levels of agreeableness. Men tend to be more
narcissistic (though this may be due to shared variance with
psychopathy), trait levels decline with age, and culture moderates
perceptions of narcissism (Wilson and Sibley, 2011; Grijalva
et al., 2015). Interpersonally, narcissism is characterized by poor

noise is associated with increased self-reported negative affect
(Masuda et al., 2018). Enhanced P3a amplitudes are associated
with disorders involving increased negative affect, including
panic disorder (Clark et al., 1996), obsessive–compulsive disorder
(Ischebeck et al., 2011), and post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) (Kimble et al., 2000). Finally, a drug that increases
NE release causes increased P3a amplitude (Missonnier et al.,
1999). Conversely, meditation reduces the amplitude of the P3
to white noise burst (Cahn and Polich, 2009). A low dose
of alcohol mutes the P3 to novelty (Marinkovic et al., 2001).
Clonidine, a drug that attenuates baseline NE activity, decreases
the amplitude of the P3a to auditory oddball stimuli (Brown
et al., 2015). Sensation seeking, a trait characterized by low
negative affect and low distress, correlates with decreased P3
(Wang and Wang, 2001).
In sum, the P3 directly reflects emotional arousal and is
sensitive to distress, suggesting that P3 mean amplitude to
white noise bursts may be used as a more objective and direct
measure of emotional arousal to social exclusion. Consistent with
this, social exclusion causes increased P3a amplitude, and P3a
amplitude is related to the negative mood associated with social
exclusion (Gutz et al., 2011). A more objective measure is a
requirement in studies on narcissism and emotional reactions to
ostracism. As noted above, a narcissist’s social pain to rejection
can only be seen “in the brain” (Cascio et al., 2014), and this
pain drives compensatory behavior for people high in narcissism,
while self-report is unrelated to the degree of social pain or
compensatory behavior. Our pre–post measure of white noise
P3 amplitude thus allowed us to sidestep issues with selfreport and directly examine if narcissists, driven by a sharpened
need to obtain social validation after exclusion, would show
the greatest reduction in emotional arousal in the “selfie with
likes” condition.

THE CURRENT STUDY
To avoid the issues inherent in measuring the relationship
between narcissism and distress to social exclusion using selfreport, the current study used objective, electrophysiological
measures. To create distress, all participants first experienced
social exclusion via the well-established Cyberball task (Williams
and Jarvis, 2006; Hartgerink et al., 2015). Participants were then
randomly assigned to one of three conditions: in the “selfie with
likes” condition; participants took a “selfie,” edited and enhanced
the photo to their liking, uploaded the “selfie” to their Instagram
account, and then viewed bogus, but ostensibly real feedback
in the form of “likes” on their Instagram account. The bogus
feedback was delivered by a novel software program developed
for this study. In the “selfie” only condition, participants
similarly uploaded an edited “selfie” to their Instagram account,
but received no feedback from others and only viewed the
picture for the same duration. This condition was included to
explore whether social approval was necessary to mask distress
following social exclusion or whether self-presentation alone
was sufficient. Finally, the control condition involved viewing a
motivationally/affectively neutral image (i.e., gravel, see HarmonJones and Gable, 2009) on Instagram and involved no “selfie” or
validation from others.
Both before and after uploading the selfie onto Instagram,
participants completed a passive-listening auditory startle task,
during which EEG was recorded. Infrequent, aversive blasts of
white noise (i.e., startle stimuli) elicit a characteristic eventrelated potential (ERP) component—variously termed the P3a,
startle P3, or novelty P3 (Combs and Polich, 2006; Keil et al.,
2007). The P3 or P3a component elicited by white noise or
acoustic startle peaks over fronto-central electrodes between
∼250 and 350 ms post-stimulus and is thought to reflect rapid,
automatic shifts in attentional processes toward motivationally
salient stimuli (Polich, 2007; Volpe et al., 2007; Frank et al.,
2012). According to the locus coeruleus-norepiniphrine (LCNE) hypothesis of the P3 (Nieuwenhuis et al., 2005), the P3 is
driven by the LC-NE system and represents the cortical analog
of emotional arousal. The LC-NE system is integral to emotional
arousal (Gray and McNaughton, 2000; Berridge and Waterhouse,
2003; Ulrich-Lai and Herman, 2009). The LC is activated by the
same stimuli and is modulated by the same precedent conditions
as the P3 (e.g., in an oddball paradigm, Nieuwenhuis et al., 2005,
2011) and direct stimulation of the LC-NE system causes a P3like component (Vazey et al., 2018). Further, P3 amplitude tracks
measures of sympathetic arousal. For example, skin conductance
correlates with novelty and P3a components in auditory oddball
tasks (Rushby et al., 2005; Rushby and Barry, 2009). Further,
the sympathetic arousal component in pupil dilation to novel
sounds is associated with P3 amplitude to the same stimuli
(Widmann et al., 2018).
Importantly, the P3 is sensitive to distress or negative
affect. For example, stressful or anxiety-provoking events cause
increased P3 amplitude on a subsequent auditory oddball task
(Grillon and Ameli, 1994; Ermutlu et al., 2005). High-anxiety
people show the largest P3a, particularly after negative affect
induction (Wang et al., 2017a). Increased P3 amplitude to white

METHOD
This study received ethical approval from the University of
Canterbury Human Ethics Committee. Based on a meta-analysis
that determined that the effect of Cyberball exclusion on
intrapersonal variables (i.e., mood and arousal) was large (overall
effect size, Cohen’s d > 1; see Hartgerink et al., 2015), we aimed
to include 30 individuals per condition (according to analyses
calculated in G∗ Power statistical package: many groups ANOVA
main effects and interactions F-test, expected effect size f = 0.5,
alpha = 0.05, power = 0.95, and number of groups = 3, output
sample size = 54 for 95% power, achieving greater than 95%
power for detecting differences in distress. Alternatively, for an
interaction effect: linear multiple regression R2 increase F-test,
expected effect size f 2 = 0.15, alpha = 0.05, power = 0.95, and
number of tested predictors = 1, total number of predictors = 3,
output sample size = 89 for 95% power in detecting interaction
effects). We ran until the end of the semester. Eighty-three
undergraduates participated in the study for course credit. Six
participants were excluded for having too many artifacts (<12
artifact-free startle trials), leaving 77 participants for data analysis
(18 male, 59 female; M age = 20.8, SD = 3.73 years).

Instagram online. They read an information sheet explaining
that a screen refreshing software would start and they could
observe how many likes they received. In reality, a transparent
screen developed for the study was opened over top of the
current Instagram display. This screen then generated fake likes
on the participant’s Instagram photos. The screen would appear
to refresh every 10 s displaying a spinning loading wheel and the
Instagram “likes” would gradually increase. All participants saw
the same pattern and number of “likes” (26) over a span of 6 min.
The participant signaled the experimenter when automatically
prompted by the computer after 6 min.
In the selfie only condition, participants uploaded a new
“selfie” to their Instagram account following the same procedure.
However, upon uploading the “selfie,” they were told that would
merely be viewing the picture for approximately 5 min. No “likes”
were provided during this time. The participant also signaled
the experimenter when automatically prompted after 6 min. In
the neutral picture condition, participants did not take or upload
a “selfie” to Instagram. Instead, these participants observed a
picture of gravel on a dummy Instagram account for 6 min before
moving on to the next task. A picture of gravel was used to
ensure that participants did not find the experience rewarding
or reflect upon the self. These conditions thus allowed us to
determine if any effect on P3a mean amplitude are due to the
“likes” themselves, or merely viewing a picture of the self.

Procedure
Participants were required to bring their cell phones with the
Instagram app installed on it to take part in the study. On
arriving, all participants first proved written informed consent.
They were fitted with a 14-electrode, quick application EEG
headset (Emotiv EPOC+, Emotiv Systems, Inc., San Francisco,
CA, United States). All materials were completed on a computer.
Participants first answered demographic questions and several
personality questionnaires (all data available upon request),
including the 40-item narcissistic personality inventory (NPI,
Raskin and Terry, 1988). All participants then experienced social
exclusion using the Cyberball paradigm. After completing a premeasure passive auditory startle task, participants were randomly
assigned to one of three picture viewing conditions: a selfie
with likes condition, a selfie only condition, and neutral picture
condition (control condition). Participants then completed a
post-measure startle task and items probing suspicion and
conscientiousness. Finally, participants were fully debriefed and
thanked for their time.

Cyberball Exclusion
Participants were led to believe that they were playing a game of
virtual catch over the Internet with two other ostensibly “real”
players. Participants entered a user name that was supposedly
visible to the other players. All participants experienced Cyberball
exclusion. Participants were initially included in the virtual game
of catch (first 6 passes) but were then excluded from passes
from the other two players for the remainder of the game (the
remaining 19 passes), thus receiving the ball only 8% of the time.
Past research shows that Cyberball exclusion causes heightened
negative affect and defensive behavior (Gerber and Wheeler,
2009). Narcissists are particularly vulnerable to this experience,
demonstrating increased activation in the putative social pain
network (Cascio et al., 2014) and increased defensiveness
(Chester and DeWall, 2016). Based on this reliable effect among
people high in narcissism, we did not include a social inclusion
manipulation for comparison in order to have a more manageable
research design.

Measures
Narcissism (NPI)
As part of a larger package of questionnaires (to help ensure
people did not connect narcissism items with selfie posting),
participants scored each item from the NPI on a scale of
1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). In analyzing this
scale, we followed the recommendations made by Ackerman
et al. (2011) on NPI use. These authors demonstrated that
an NPI total score conflates meaningfully different aspects of
personality and a three-factor solution provides more accurate
demonstrations of psychological processes in narcissism. We
computed and examined the same three facets of narcissism
(see Ackerman et al., 2011, for full description of facets),
including “Leadership/Authority” (L/A, e.g., “If I ruled the world
it would be a better place”; α = 0.835), “Grandiose Exhibitionism”
(GE, e.g., “I like to look at my body,” α = 0.739), and
“Entitlement/Exploitativeness” (E/E, e.g., “I will never be satisfied
until I get all that I deserve,” α = 0.566). We used the NPI given
its widespread use in SP research (Cain et al., 2008). Notably,
this three-factor solution has been demonstrated as reliable and
valid (Ackerman et al., 2018), including in research on selfie
posting and narcissism (Weiser, 2015). As in past research, men
in our sample demonstrated higher levels of narcissism on each
subscale (all p’s < 0.05).

Selfie Manipulation
After the first startle task, participants were randomly assigned to
one of three conditions: the selfie with likes condition, the selfie
only condition, or the neutral picture condition.
In the selfie with likes condition, participants were instructed
to take and upload a “selfie” to their Instagram account, and
include the following hashtags: #selfie #fitspo #fitspiration. They
were informed that the purpose of this exercise was to examine
how the use of highly popular hashtags, guaranteed to get high
exposure on Instagram, influenced social feedback in the form of
“likes.” Participants were taken to a side room and were given
time to take and edit a “selfie” on their phones. They showed
the experimenter prior to uploading the image to make sure
the hashtags and sizing were correct. Participants then uploaded
their “selfie” and handed their phone to the examiner to avoid
distraction throughout the remainder of the study. Participants
then returned to their computer and opened the “selfie” on

Auditory Startle Paradigm
Following Cyberball, participants put on headphones (volume
setting 50 in Windows) and listened passively to a series of beeps
(pure 1000 Hz tones for 50 ms) and white noise blasts. The ratio
of startling noises to beeps was 2:8. Each stimulus was presented
for a second and the entire paradigm lasted for 3 min, for a total

both beeps and startle stimuli as the mean positive amplitude
between 275 and 450 ms after stimulus at site where the
startle component was maximal, the fronto-central electrode F4
(see Figure 1). A P3 change score was computed [deltaP3 or
(D)P3 = Auditory Oddball Time 2 - Time 1] to determine the
degree to which people showed a decrease in P3 amplitude as
a function of condition and narcissism levels. A P3 difference
score (P3diff = white noise - standard tone) was also computed
to remove processes common to both ERPs and isolate an
error-specific variable (Luck, 2014). Finally, a P3diff change
score [(D)P3diff = Auditory Oddball Time 2 - Time 1] was
computed to ensure that changes in P3 were specific to white
noise stimuli. Note that all variables proved normal in terms
of skewness and kurtosis (George and Mallery, 2010). Further,
all necessary assumptions for moderation analyses were met,
including those related to multicollinearity, independence of
residuals, homoscedasticity, normality of residuals, and evidence
that no influential cases biased the data.

of 180 trials (approximately 36 static and 144 beep trials). To
minimize movement, participants were asked to fixate on a small
cross presented on the computer screen during the task. This
task was presented both before and after the manipulation. We
focused on the P3 ERP component to white noise as an index
of emotional arousal after a distressing event—social exclusion.
Recall that the P3 is enhanced during social exclusion and the
P3 is related to negative mood following Cyberball exclusion (see
Wang et al., 2017b). Further, the link between P3 and emotional
arousal is strongest at frontal nodes (Ermutlu et al., 2005), in
passive auditory oddball tasks (Grillon and Ameli, 1994; Rushby
and Barry, 2009), in response to highly deviant and expectancy
violating stimuli (Nieuwenhuis et al., 2011; Frank et al., 2012),
and in relation to the P3a or novelty P3 component (Missonnier
et al., 1999; Brown et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017a,b; Widmann
et al., 2018). Consequently, to provide the best index of emotional
arousal, we focused on the P3 to infrequent white noise bursts in
a passive auditory oddball task, measured at frontal nodes.

EEG Recording and Analyses
During both pre- and post-manipulation auditory startle tasks,
electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded using a 14-channel
(gold-plated contact-grade hardened copper with felt pads
moistened with saline) Emotiv EEG wireless headset (Emotiv
Systems, Inc., San Francisco, CA, United States) and Emotiv
TestBench software at a sampling rate of 128 Hz. The 14 channels,
AF3, AF4, F3, F4, F7, F8, FC5, FC6, P7, T7, T8, P8, O1,
and O2, were positioned according to the 10–20 International
System. Two mastoid electrodes were used as online reference.
Validation research demonstrates that this headset system proves
a reliable alternative to standard systems in measuring ERPs
to auditory oddball stimuli, including measures of the N2 and
P3 components at frontal electrodes (Badcock et al., 2013;
Mayaud et al., 2013). Emotiv EEG technology has become
an increasingly popular alternative to standard EEG systems
in social and cognitive neuroscience research (Louwerse and
Hutchinson, 2012; Steinhubl et al., 2015; Agroskin et al., 2016)
and in brain–computer interface (BCI) applications (Bobrov
et al., 2011; Debener et al., 2012; Choi and Jo, 2013; Khushaba
et al., 2013; O’Regan and Marnane, 2013; De Vos et al., 2014;
Vourvopoulos and Liarokapis, 2014).
Using the analysis software Brain Vision Analyzer 2.0 (BVA 2),
EEG data from both recordings was band-pass filtered between
0.1 and 30 Hz. Blinks were statistically removed using the
automatic ocular independent component analysis (HEOG and
VEOG reference electrode = AF3) in BVA 2, which isolates and
deletes blink-related factors. Artifacts were then automatically
detected and removed using the following parameters −100 to
+100 µV min/max threshold, 50 µV maximum voltage step,
0.5 µV lowest allowed voltage (maximum–minimum) in 100ms intervals. Data were segmented into 1000-ms epochs locked
on either beep or white noise presentation, 200 ms before to
800 ms after the stimulus. All artifact-free epochs were then
averaged, creating average ERPs of beeps and startle tones for
each participant. Each average ERP was baseline-corrected by
subtracting the average voltage during the 200–0 ms time period
prior to the stimulus. The white noise P3 was quantified for

RESULTS
Our primary research question is based on the idea that social
media can fulfill a narcissistic need, and we expected that people
who were high in narcissism would be the most prone to
these effects. We had no expectations for main effects or effects
at other levels of narcissism. Thus, we conducted moderated
multiple regression analyses using Hayes (2013) PROCESS macro
(Model 1, 5,000 bias-corrected bootstrapped resamples) with
X = condition (coded as X1: 0 = selfie with likes, 1 = selfie only,
0 = neutral picture; and X2: 0 = selfie with likes, 0 = selfie only,
1 = neutral picture), W = narcissism subscale, and Y = (D)P3 for
each narcissism subscale, Bonferroni corrected for multiple tests
(α = 0.05/3 = 0.0167). Results revealed that the narcissism facet
L/A interacted with condition to impact (D)P3, F(2,75) = 5.027,
p = 0.009, R2 = 0.117 (see Figure 2). Comparison of estimated
conditional means (ECM, at the 84th percentile for high and
16th percentile for low levels of narcissism) revealed that at high
levels of the L/A facet of narcissism (84th percentile = 3.50),
people in the selfie with likes condition (ECM = −2.486) showed
a significant decrease in (D)P3 mean amplitude compared to
those in the selfie only condition (ECM = 0.905), t(76) = 2.062,
p = 0.043, CI [0.111, 6.671] and the neutral picture condition
(ECM = 1.303), t(76) = 2.411, p = 0.019, CI [0.656, 6.923]. At
low levels of the L/A facet of narcissism (16th percentile = 2.20),
people in the selfie with likes condition (ECM = 1.745) showed
a significant increase in (D)P3 mean amplitude compared
to only those in the neutral picture condition (ECM = 2.784), t(76) = 2.223, p = 0.0029, CI [−8.589, −0.467], but
there was no difference between the two selfie conditions at
low L/A (p = 0.994).
Similar analyses also revealed that the narcissism facet L/A
interacted with condition to impact (D)P3diff, F(2,71) = 7.005,
p = 0.002, R2 = 0.154 (see Figure 3). As above, comparison of
estimated conditional means revealed that at high levels of L/A,
people in the selfie with likes condition (ECM = -4.535) showed
a significant decrease in (D)P3 mean amplitude compared to

each of the above analyses did not change the results. Notably,
post hoc power analysis, calculated in G∗ Power, revealed that
observed power = 0.917.
Finally, the same analyses for both the GE and E/E facets
demonstrated non-significant interactions for both the (D)P3
and (D)P3diff scores (all ps > 0.520). Thus, the current results are
specific to the L/A facet of narcissism, as measured with the NPI.1

to emotional arousal and is heightened by distressing events
(Masson and Bidet-Caulet, 2018), including distress after social
exclusion (Gutz et al., 2011). The auditory startle task was
administered both before and after the manipulation to index P3
mean amplitude changes.
We found that participants high in the narcissism subscale
L/A that received “likes” on a “selfie” showed the largest pre–
post decrease in P3 mean amplitude and the P3 difference wave
mean amplitude, compared to people high in L/A in the other
conditions. The other narcissism subscales, GE and E/E, did
not interact with condition to predict change in P3 amplitude.
These results suggest that, for people with a stronger sense
of leadership ability and dominance, social media validation
reduced distress caused by social exclusion. The L/A facet is
viewed as the more adaptive aspect of the NPI (Ackerman et al.,
2011). This suggests that current results may reflect a more
adaptive regulatory process. This could also partially explain
why narcissists are more active on social media (Buffardi and
Campbell, 2008) and report more frequent “selfie” posting (Barry
et al., 2017). Furthermore, these results support the idea that
social media may provide certain (but not all) narcissists with
an ideal solution to their unique social dilemma. It allows them
to reliably attain social validation without resorting to real-world
relationships that typically require reciprocity and sacrifice.
The current study has certain limitations that may be
addressed in future research. First, future work could add a
comparison condition to the design and manipulate exclusion
vs. inclusion to examine if heightened distress among people

DISCUSSION
The current study used a multidisciplinary, multimethod
approach to examine if people high in narcissism regulate
distress through social media approval. We designed a novel
software to provide ostensibly genuine “likes” on real “selfie”
photos posted on valid Instagram accounts. All participants first
experienced the negative emotional event of social exclusion via
the Cyberball task (Williams and Jarvis, 2006). After exclusion,
participants were randomly assigned to either view a real,
personal “selfie” that quickly received a significant number
of likes, view a “selfie” with no feedback, or view a neutral
picture. To measure distress (and avoid the self-presentation
and bias concerns that go hand in hand with narcissism
research), we indexed the P3 mean amplitude to aversive,
unexpected bursts of white noise. This ERP component is related

Conducting the same analyses using an NPI total score demonstrates comparable,
but mostly non-significant, results.

Narcissism and Social Media Approval

high in narcissism in the exclusion condition only shows reduced
distress to approval on selfie posting. Moreover, while the current
research focuses on a social threat as narcissists are particularly
sensitive to social exclusion, future work should also examine
whether non-social threats (e.g., trying to solve challenging math
problems) produce similar distress levels for people high in
narcissism that can subsequently be alleviated by social media.
Second, we did not include a self-report measure of distress
because we felt self-report was uniquely ill-suited to the current
research questions. This was based on research demonstrating
that narcissism does not predict self-reported distress to social
exclusion despite increased activation in the social pain network
(Cascio et al., 2014) and increased defensiveness (Chester and
DeWall, 2016). Further, including such a measure could inform
the participant about our research questions and produce
demand characteristics, particularly for the already defensive and
biased individuals high in narcissism. However, at the end of
the study, we did include a measure of meaning in life (Steger
et al., 2006), which includes the meaning presence subscale.
Meaning presence has been found to be correlated with low
levels of anxiety and distress, and a lack of meaning has been
found to be correlated with high levels of anxiety (Steger et al.,
2008). Having this measure allowed us to examine the following:
if white noise P3 amplitude is positively related to levels of
distress, and meaning presence is negatively related to distress,
then white noise P3 amplitude should be negatively related
to meaning presence. Correlational analyses support this idea.
The meaning presence subscale was negatively correlated with
both Time 1 and Time 2 white noise P3 amplitudes (Time 1:
r = −0.252, p = 0.027; Time 2: r = −0.261, p = 0.022). Considering
these results and the facts that social exclusion reliably elicits
negative affect (Hartgerink et al., 2015), the white noise stimulus
is itself aversive (Masuda et al., 2018), and the LC-NE system is
critically involved in distressed responses, the most parsimonious
interpretation is that the P3 was sensitive to distress in this

study. However, future work may address the current limitations
associated with these kinds of inferences and use corroborative
measures of emotional arousal. Finally, future research could
benefit from adapting the current research questions to a withinsubjects design.
Overall, however, our findings support the idea that social
media may be a happy hunting ground for narcissistic needs.
We found that validation through “likes” on a real “selfie” posted
online reduced neural indices of emotional arousal after social
exclusion for people high on the L/A subscale of narcissism.
Such narcissists, who prioritize social superiority over relational
harmony, face a dilemma. Pursuing asymmetric relationships
for narcissistic needs can tend to disrupt those relationships.
Social validation earned online might allow certain people
high in narcissism to sidestep that dilemma and efficiently
regulate distress.
