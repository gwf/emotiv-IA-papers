Abstract. The article describes the design process of building a hybrid brain-computer interface based on
Electrooculography (EOG) and centre eye tracking. In the first paragraph authors presented theoretical
information about Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrooculography (EOG), and Eye. Authors prepared an
overview of the literature concerning hybrid BCIs. The interface was built with use of bioactive sensors
mounted on the head. Movement of industrial robot model was triggered by a signal from eyes movement by
EOG and eye tracking. The built interface has been tested. Three experiments were carried out. In all
experiments, three people aged 25-35 were involved. 30 attempts per scenario were recorded. Between each
attempt, a respondent had a 1-minute break. The investigators attempted to move cube from one table to the
other.

1 Introduction
Nowadays, computers can be found everywhere around
us. They serve us both for work and fun. Non-disabled
people have no problems using devices such as a mouse
or keyboard to communicate with them. Despite this
fact, people are constantly looking for new interfaces
to communicate with the computer. Especially, the part
dealing with the interaction of people with disabilities
with a computer seems to be particularly interesting.
For instance, systems based on vision systems. An
interface was created using the Kinect camera, which
is usually used as a play tool. Thanks to it, people with
paresis can issue commands by looking at the screen
[1]. Using the same camera, an interface for sign
language was created [2]. Another type of interface is
the voice recognition system, implemented nowadays
in almost every telephone [3, 4]. Currently, a very
interesting part of human-computer interfaces are these
based on data coming straight from the human body.
There are two main sources of these signals. The most
commonly used ones are these from muscles. Using
electromyography (EMG) hand gestures can be
recognised [5]. Other interfaces are based on signals
coming from the human brain. This is especially
important for bedridden people. Due to a significant
drop in the price of devices, the most common method
of
obtaining
signals
from
the
brain
is
Electroencephalography [6].

2 Theoretical background
2.1 Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)
Electroencephalography is a non-invasive method of
recording a bioelectric activity of the brain straight
from a subject's skull. Electrodes are usually placed in
*

the “10-20” system [7]. Thanks to the use of this
system, the influence of the skull size of the examined
person is omitted. EEG is the basic method used in
constructing the brain-computer interface. Each of the
BCI methods is limited to the number of commands
that can be generated. Therefore, more and more often
hybrid BCI are used. The division based on [8] is
presented in Fig.1. The main purpose of using more
than one interface is to increase the number of
commands and improve the classification of existing
ones.

2.2 Electrooculography EOG
During the EEG test, artefacts can be observed.
Artefacts are all signals that do not come directly from
the brain [9]. Artefacts can come from the environment
as a change in the electrodes, movement of the
electrodes, related to the bioelectric activity of the skin,
as well as from the human body like muscle activity,

induced eye movements and facial gestures. Artefacts
are usually considered useless and are removed from
the result. Authors used AF3, AF4, F7 and F8
electrodes to do very simple electrooculography test.
Electrooculography (EOG) is a non-invasive
diagnostic method applied near eyeballs. An eye is an
electric dipole. Changes in the position of the eyeball
result in changes in the electrical charge. This change
is registered by electrode [10].

2.3 Eye Tracking
There are many ways to track eye movements. In this
article, authors used an algorithm based on Means of
Gradients [11]. This algorithm has been implemented
in an eyeLike library. The library in the first place
recognises the face in a picture. For this purpose, the
Viola-Jones method based on Haar wavelets [12] was
used. On the basis of the contrast between the iris and
the sclera, a group of colours was isolated. The optimal
centre c∗ of a circular object in an image:

Finding joint angles of the robot by having the position
and orientation of the end of effector is the main
problem [13]. This problem can be solved by inverse
kinematics. The angle of the first joint can be
calculated by the projection of a vector from origin of
frame 𝐾0 to origin of frame 𝐾4 on the X-Y plane. This
0
vector is ⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗
𝑃 . The target transformation matrix relative

to the base is 𝐺0𝑇 .

2.4 Mitsubishi RV-12sl robot kinematics
Mitsubishi RV-12sl is a six-axis industrial robot. In
order to solve the inverse kinematics, a D-H parameter
table should be created. It is presented in Tab. 1. These
parameters describe the structure of the robot shown in

2.5 State of the Art
In the article [14] authors built a hybrid brain-computer
interface. They combined steady-state visual evoked
potential (SSVEP) and P300 paradigm. Thanks to that,
authors increased the precision of command detection.
Authors of articles [15] proposed hybrid interface
which
fused
electromyographic
(EMG)
with
electroencephalographic (EEG). Using this system
facilitates a controlling process. This system may be used
even by people tired throughout the day.
Another hybrid interface was presented by authors of
the article [16]. ERS method was used as switch to
activate functions of four-step orthosis. To open and close
this orthosis was used SSVEP.
Authors of articles [17] presented a combination of
tasks that could inspire BCI systems that are more
accurate than conventional BCIs, especially for users who
cannot attain accuracy adequate for effective
communication.

3.1 Emotiv EPOC+ Headset
Emotiv EPOC+ Headset (Fig. 4) is low cost neuroheadset.
This headset can record data from a range of 0.16 to 43Hz.
It has 14 EEG electrodes and two additional reference
electrodes which are arranged according to the 10-20
system. The 16-bit ADC can record data with sampling
rate equal 256 samples per second. For measurements in
this headset, wet electrodes based on saline were used
[18].

In the second scenario, the investigators attempted to
move cube from one virtual table to another table in the
shortest possible time (Fig. 7). All tests have been completed
successfully. The fastest attempt lasted 15.6 seconds. The
longest attempt lasted 27.7 seconds. The average duration of
trials was 23.8 seconds. Fig. 8 shows the path of the end point
of robotic arm in the all axes of moves for the one of the
attempt.
In the third scenario, the investigators attempted to move
cube from one virtual table to another table in the shortest
possible time (Fig. 9). In this scenario, a wall between tables
was added. With this experiment, not all attempts were
successful. Approximately 85% of the tests were completed
with success. The fastest attempt was 19.2 seconds. The
longest attempt lasted 38.7 seconds. The average trial
duration was 37.8 seconds.

3.2 Software
Two programs in C# were written for the purpose of
this paper (Fig. 5). First in Visual Studio to receive
signal from EOG from Emotiv EPOC+ using Xavier
SDK. The same program recognises the centre of eye
using camera and eyeLike library. In this program, a
user can change influence of signal from EOG and
camera to results and change value of a threshold.
The second program was written in Unity 3D. In
this program, kinematics model and gravitation were
implemented.

In the same program all tests were carried out. Both
programs exchange data with Memory Mapped Files.
Fig. 7. View of the second scenario.

4 Tests and results
In all experiments, three people aged 25-35 were
involved. Each of them participated in 5 to 10 attempts
of each scenario. Between each attempt, the respondent
had a 1-minute break. The eye movement to the right
or left triggered the movement of the robot. To change
the direction of movement, the tested person was
closing and opening eyes twice in no more than 2
seconds.
In the first scenario, the tested person practiced using
the system (Fig. 6). The threshold was also adapted to
the person being examined. The subject was to raise the
cube using an industry robot model. The cube was
connected to the end of the manipulator at the moment
of its contact to simulate the gripper.

errors in the third scenario resulted from human
mistakes. There were no incorrect classifications in the
trails. The least intuitive is the way the axes movement.
The selection in the loop is ambiguous. The specific
axis cannot be chosen. When changing from the Y axis
to X there is a need for a double change. This moment
was crucial for the times obtained. Authors want to add
additional interface based on SSVEP method and
control real industrial robot.
The work described in this paper was funded from
02/22/DSMK/1458.

The article describes design process of building the
hybrid

interface
based
on
Electrooculography (EOG) and centre eye tracking.
Authors have proved that it is possible to obtain
satisfactory results in controlling the industrial robot
model only from electrodes already placed as standard
in the Emotiv EPOC + headset and standard web
camera. It was proved that moving objects with the
robot and performing more complicated tasks such as
avoiding obstacles is possible. It is also noticeable that
the length of trials was getting shorter with practice.
The method of controlling the industrial robot is
intuitive, which confirms the obtained results. Most
