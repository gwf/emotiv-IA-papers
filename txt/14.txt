Abstract
Multimodal wearable sensor data classification
plays an important role in ubiquitous computing
and has a wide range of applications in scenarios
from healthcare to entertainment. However, most
existing work in this field employs domain-specific
approaches and is thus ineffective in complex situations where multi-modality sensor data are collected. Moreover, the wearable sensor data are less
informative than the conventional data such as texts
or images. In this paper, to improve the adaptability of such classification methods across different application domains, we turn this classification
task into a game and apply a deep reinforcement
learning scheme to deal with complex situations
dynamically. Additionally, we introduce a selective
attention mechanism into the reinforcement learning scheme to focus on the crucial dimensions of
the data. This mechanism helps to capture extra
information from the signal and thus it is able to
significantly improve the discriminative power of
the classifier. We carry out several experiments on
three wearable sensor datasets and demonstrate the
competitive performance of the proposed approach
compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.

Introduction

Nowadays, diverse categories of sensors can be found in various wearable devices. Such devices are now being widely
applied in multiple fields, such as Internet of Things [Kamburugamuve et al., 2015; Zhang et al., ]. As a result, massive
multimodal sensor data are being produced continuously. The
question that how we can deal with these data efficiently and
effectively has become a major concern.
Compared to conventional sensor data such as images and
videos, these data are naturally formed as a 1-D signal, with
each element representing one sensor channel accordingly.
There are several challenges for such sensor data classification. First, most existing classification methods use domain-

3111

specific knowledge and thus may become ineffective or even
fail in complex situations where multimodal sensor data are
being collected [Bigdely-Shamlo et al., 2015]. For example,
one approach that works well on IMU (Inertial Measurement
Unit) signals may not be able to deal with EEG (Electroencephalography) brain signals. Therefore, an effective and universal sensor data classification method is highly desirable for
complex situations. This framework is expected to have both
efficiency and robustness over various sensor signals.
Second, the wearable sensor data carries far less information than texts and images. For example, a sample signal
gathered by a 64-channel EEG equipment only contains 64
numerical elements. Hence, a more effective classifier is required to extract discriminative information from such limited
raw data. However, maximizing the utilization of the given
scarce data demands cautious preprocessing and a rich fund
of domain knowledge.
Inspired by attention mechanism [Cavanagh and others,
1992], we propose to concentrate on a focal zone of the signal to automatically learn the informative attention patterns
for different sensor combinations. Here, the focal zone is
a selection block of the signal with a certain length, sliding over the feature dimensions. Note that reinforcement
learning has been shown to be capable of learning humancontrol level policy on a variety of tasks [Mnih et al., 2015].
Then we exploit the reinforcement learning to discover the
focal zone. Moreover, considering that the signals in different categories may have different inter-dimension dependency [Markham and Townshend, 1981], we propose to use
the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory [Gers et al., 1999;
Zhang et al., 2018]) to exploit the latent correlation between
signal dimensions. We propose a weighted average spatial
LSTM (WAS-LSTM) classifier by exploring the dependency
in sensor data.
The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
• We propose a selective attention mechanism for sensor data classification using the spatial information only.
The proposed method is insensitive to sensor types since
it is capable of handling multimodal sensor data.
• We apply deep reinforcement learning to automatically

model. In each step t, one action is selected by the state transition to update st based on the agent’s feedback. The reward model evaluates
the quality of the focal zone to the reward rt . The dueling DQN is employed to find the optimal focal zone x̄∗i which will be feed into the
LSTM based classifier to explore the inter-dimension dependency and predict the sample’s label yi0 . F CL denotes Fully Connected Layer.

select the most distinguishable features, called focal
zone, for multimodal sensor data of different sensor
types and combinations. We design a novel objective
function as the award in reinforcement learning task to
optimize the focal zone. The new reward model saves
more than 98% training time of the deep reinforcement
learning.
• We propose Weighted Average Spatial LSTM classifier
to capture the cross-dimensional dependency in multimodal sensor data.

Proposed Method

Suppose the input sensor data can be denoted by X =
{(xi , yi ), i = 1, 2, · · · I} where (xi , yi ) denotes the 1-D sensor signal, called one sample in this paper, and I denotes the
number of samples. In each sample, the feature xi ∈ RK
contains K elements and the corresponding ground truth
yi ∈ R is an integer denotes the sample’s category. xi can
be described as a vector with K elements, xi = {xik , k =
1, 2, · · · , K}.
The proposed algorithm is shown in Figure 1. The main
focus of the algorithm is to exploit the latent dependency between different signal dimensions. To this end, the proposed
approach contains several components: 1) the replicate and
shuffle processing; 2) the selective attention learning; 3) the
sequential LSTM-based classification. In the following, we
will first discuss the motivations of the proposed method and
then introduce the aforementioned components in details.

2.1

Motivation

How to exploit the latent relationship between sensor signal
dimensions is the main focus of the proposed approach. The
signals belonging to different categories are supposed to have

3112

different inter-dimension dependent relationships which contain rich and discriminative information. This information is
critical to improve the distinctive signal pattern discovery.
In practice, the sensor signal is often arranged as 1-D vector, which is less informative for the limited and fixed element
arrangement. The elements order and the number of elements
in each signal vector can affect the element dependency. In
many real-world scenarios, the multimodal sensor data are associated with the practical placement. For example, the EEG
data are concatenated following the distribution of biomedical EEG channels. Unfortunately, the practical sensor sequence, with the fixed order and number, may not be suitable
for inter-dimension dependency analysis. Meanwhile, the optimal dimension sequence [Tan et al., 2015] varies with the
sensor types and combinations. Therefore, we propose the
following three techniques to amend these drawbacks.
First, we replicate and shuffle the input sensor signal vector
on dimension-wise in order to provide as much latent dependency as possible among feature dimensions (Section 2.2).
Second, we introduce a focal zone as a selective attention mechanism, where the optimal inter-dimension dependency for each sample only depends on a small subset of features. Here, the focal zone is optimized by deep reinforcement learning which has been proved to be stable and wellperformed in policy learning (Section 2.3).
Third, we propose the WAS-LSTM classifier by extracting
the distinctive inter-dimension dependency (Section 2.4).

2.2

Data Replicate and Shuffle

To provide more potential inter-dimension spatial dependencies, we propose a method called Replicate and Shuffle (RS).
RS is a two-step feature transformation method which maps
xi to a higher dimensional space x0i with more complete ele-

ment combinations:
0

xi ∈ RK → x0i ∈ RK , K 0 > K
In the first step (Replicate), replicate xi for h = K 0 %K + 1
times where % denotes remainder operation. Then we get a
new vector with length as h ∗ K which is not less than K 0 ; in
the second step (Shuffle), we randomly shuffle the replicated
vector in the first step and intercept the first K 0 element to
generate x0i . Theoretically, compared to xi , x0i contains more
diverse and complete inter-dimension dependencies.

2.3

Selective Attention Mechanism

In the next process, we attempt to find the optimal dependency which includes the most distinctive information. But
K 0 , the length of x0i , is too large and is computationally expensive. To balance the length and the information content,
we introduce the attention mechanism [Cavanagh and others,
1992]. We introduce the attention mechanism to emphasize
the informative fragment in x0i and denote the fragment by x̄i ,
which is called focal zone. Suppose x̄i ∈ RK̄ and K̄ denotes
the length of the focal zone. For simplification, we continue
denote the k-th element by x̄ik in the focal zone. To optimize the focal zone, we employ deep reinforcement learning
as the optimization framework for its excellent performance
in policy optimization [Mnih et al., 2015].
Overview. As shown in Figure 1, the focal zone optimization includes two key components: the environment (including state transition and reward model), and the agent. Three
elements (the state s, the action a, and the reward r) are exchanged in the interaction between the environment and the
agent. All of the three elements are customized based on the
specific situation in this paper.
• The state S = {st , t = 0, 1, · · · , T } ∈ R2 describes
the position of the focal zone, where t denotes the time
stamp. In the training, s0 is initialized as s0 = [(K 0 −
K̄)/2, (K 0 + K̄)/2]. Since the focal zone is a shifting
fragment on 1-D x0i , we design two parameters to define the state: st = {starttidx , endtidx }, where starttidx
and endtidx separately denote the start index and the end
index of the focal zone1 .
• The action A = {at , t = 0, 1, · · · , T } ∈ R4 describes
which the agent could choose to act on the environment.
In our case, we define 4 categories of actions for the focal zone (as described in the State Transition part in
Figure 1): left shifting, right shifting, extend, and condense. Here at time stamp t, the state transition only
choose one action to implement following the agent’s
policy π: st+1 = π(st , at ).
• The reward R = {rt , t = 0, 1, · · · , T } ∈ R is calculated by the reward model, which will be detailed later.
The reward model Φ: rt = Φ(st ) receives the current
state and returns an evaluation as the reward.
• We employ the Dueling DQN (Deep Q Networks [Wang
et al., 2015]) as the optimization policy π(st , at ),
For example, for a random x0i = [3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 1, 6, 0], the state
{starttidx = 2, endtidx = 5} is sufficient to determine the focal
zone as [8, 9, 2, 1].

which is enabled to learn the state-value function efficiently. Dueling DQN learns the Q value V (st ) and
the advantage function A(st , at ) and combines them:
Q(st , at ) ← V (st ), A(st , at ). The primary reason we
employ a dueling DQN to optimize the focal zone is that
it updates all the four Q values2 at every step while other
policy only updates one Q value at each step.
Reward Model. Next, we detailedly introduce the design
of the reward model for it is one crucial contribution of this
paper. The purpose of reward model is to evaluate how the
current state impact our final target which refers to the classification performance in our case. Intuitively, the state which
can lead to the better classification performance should have
a higher reward: rt = F (st ). As a result, in the standard
reinforcement learning framework, the original reward model
regards the classification accuracy as the reward. F refers
to the WAS-LSTM. Note, WAS-LSTM focuses on the spatial
dependency between different dimensions at the same timepoint while the normal LSTM focuses on the temporal dependency between a sequence of samples collected at different
time-points. However, the WAS-LSTM requires considerable
training time, which will dramatically increase the optimization time of the whole algorithm. In this section, we propose
an alternative method to calculate the reward: construct a new
reward function rt = G(st ) which is positively related with
rt = F (st ). Therefore, we can employ G to replace F . Then,
the task is changed to construct a suitable G which can evaluate the inter-dimension dependency in the current state st and
feedback the corresponding reward rt . We propose an alternative G composed by three components: the autoregressive
model [Akaike, 1969] to exploit the inter-dimension dependency in x0i , the Silhouette Score [Laurentini, 1994] to evaluate the similarity of the autoregressive coefficients, and the
reward function based on the silhouette score.
The autoregressive model [Akaike, 1969] receives the focal
zone x̄i and specifies that how the last variable depends on its
own previous values.
p
X
x̄iK̄ =
ϕj x̄i(K̄−j) + C + ε̄
j=1

where p is the order of the autoregressive model, C indicates a constant, and ε̄ indicates the withe noise. From
this equation, we can infer that the autoregressive coefficient
ϕ = {ϕj , j = 1, 2, · · · , p} ∈ Rp incorporates the dependent
relationship in the focal zone. Then, to evaluate how rich information is taken in the ϕ, we employ silhouette score [Lovmar et al., 2005] to interpret the consistence of ϕ. The higher
score sst indicates the focal zone in state st contains more
inter-dimension dependency, which means x̄i is easier to be
classified by the classifier in the next stage. At last, based on
the sst ∈ [−1, 1], we design a reward function:
esst +1
K̄
−β 0
e2 − 1
K
The function contains two parts, the first part is a normalized exponential function with the exponent sst + 1 ∈ [0, 1],
rt =

2
Since we have four actions in at , the Q(st , at ) contains 4 Q
values. The arrangement is similar with the one-hot label.

Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-18)

this part encourages the reinforcement learning algorithm to
search the better st which leads to a higher sst . The motivation of the exponential function is that: the reward growth
rate is increasing with the silhouette score’s increase3 . The
second part is a penalty factor for the focal zone length to
keep the bar shorter and the β is the penalty coefficient.
In summary, the aim of focal zone optimization is to learn
the optimal focal zone x̄∗i which can lead to the maximum
reward. The optimization totally iterates N = ne ∗ ns times
where ne and ns separately denote the number of episodes
and steps [Wang et al., 2015]. ε-greedy method [Tokic, 2010]
is employed in the state transition.

2.4

Weighted Average Spatial LSTM Classifier

In this section, we propose Weighted Average Spatial LSTM
classification for two purposes. The first attempt is to capture the cross-relationship among feature dimensions in the
optimized focal zone x̄∗i . The LSTM-based classifier is
widely used for its excellent sequential information extraction ability which is approved in several research areas such
as natural language processing [Gers and Schmidhuber, 2001;
Sundermeyer et al., 2012]. Compared to other commonly employed spatial feature extraction methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTM is less depends on the hyperparameters setting. However, the traditional LSTM focuses
on the temporal dependency among a sequence of samples.
Technically, the input data of traditional LSTM is 3-D tensor shaped as [nb , nt , K̄] where nb and ns denote the batch
size and the number of temporal sample, separately. The
WAS-LSTM aims to capture the dependency among various
dimensions at one temporal point, therefore, we set nt = 1
and transpose the input data as: [nb , nt , K̄] → [nb , K̄, nt ].
The second advantage of WAS-LSTM is that it could stabilize the performance of LSTM via moving average method
[Lipton et al., 2015]. Specifically, we calculate the LSTM
outputs Oi by averaging the past two outputs instead of only
the final one (Figure 1):

The predicted label is calculated by yi0 = L(x̄∗i ) where L denotes the LSTM algorithm. `2 -norm (with parameter λ) is
adopted as regularization to prevent overfitting. The sigmoid

• EID. The EID (EEG ID identification) is collected in
a constrained setting where 8 subjects (5 males and 3
females) aged 26±2. EEG signal monitors the electrical
activity of the brain. This dataset gathers the raw EEG
signals by Emotiv EPOC+ headset with 14 channels at
the sampling rate of 128 Hz.

Experiments

In this section, we evaluate the proposed approach over 3 sensor signal datasets (separately collected by EEG headset, environmental sensor, and wearable sensor) including 2 widely
used public datasets and 2 limited but more practical local
datasets. Firstly we describe the details of each dataset. Secondly, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness by
comparing the performance of our approach to baselines and
state-of-the-art. Lastly, we provide the efficiency of the alternative reward model designed in Section 2.3.

For example, for the same silhouette score increment 0.1, sst :
0.9 → 1.0 can earn higher reward increment than sst : 0.1 → 0.2.

Results

In this section, we compare the proposed approach with baselines and the state-of-the-art methods. Our method focuses
on the focal zone which is optimized by deep reinforcement
learning and then explores the dependency between sensor
signal elements by a deep learning classifier. All the three
datasets are randomly split into the training set (90%) and the
testing set (10%). Each sample is one sensor vector recording
collected at one time point. Through the previous experimental tuning and the Orthogonal Array based hyper-parameters
tuning method [Zhang et al., 2017], the hyper-parameters are
set as following. In the selective attention learning: the order of autoregressive is 3; K̄ = 128, the Dueling DQN has 4

Relu activation function is employed in the CNN. The results
from Tables 2 ∼ 4 show that:
• Our approach outperforms all the baselines and the stateof-the-arts over all the local and public datasets ranging
from EEG, RFID to wearable IMU sensors;
• The sensor spatial based WAS-LSTM classifier achieves
a high-level performance, which indicates the method
that extracting inter-dimension dependency for classification is effective;
• Our method (WAS-LSTM with focal zone) performs
better than WAS-LSTM, which illustrates that the
learned informative attention is effective.
To have a closer observation, the CM (confusion matrix)

Reward Model Efficiency Demonstration

In this paper, we propose a new reward model to replace the
original reward model: G → F . The original F , in our case,
refers to the WAS-LSTM classifier (Section 2.4), intuitively.
F requires a large amount of training time to find the optimal focal zone x̄∗ . Take the EID dataset as an example,
F needs around 4000 sec on the Titan X (Pascal) GPU for
each step while the whole focal zone optimization contains N
(N > 2000) iterations. Therefore, to save training time, we
attempt to employ G to approximate G to update the reward.
Thus, two prerequisites are demanded: 1) G should have high
correlation with F to guarantee arg max G ≈ arg max F ; 2)
x̄∗

x̄∗

the training time of G should be shorter than F . In this section, we demonstrate the two prerequisites by experimental
analyzes.
First, on the focal zone optimization procedure on EID
dataset, we conduct an experiment to measure a batch of data
pairs of the reward (represents the reward of G) and the WASLSTM classifier accuracy (represents the reward of F ). The
relationship between the reward and the accuracy is shown
in Figure 3. The figure illustrates that the accuracy has an
approximately linear relationship with the reward. The correlations coefficient is 0.8258 (with p-value as 0.0115), which
demonstrates the accuracy and reward are highly positive related. As a result, we can estimate arg max F by arg max G.

x̄∗

Moreover, another experiment is carried on to measure the
single step training time of two reward models G and F . The
training times are marked as T1 and T2, respectively. Figure 4 qualitatively shows that T2 is much higher than T1 (8
states represent 8 different focal zones). Quantitatively, the
sum of T1 over 8 states is 35237.41 sec while the sum of
T2 is 601.58 sec. This results demonstrate that the proposed
approach, designing a G to approximate and estimate the F ,
saves 98.3% training time in focal zone optimization.

Furthermore, the proposed WAS-LSTM directly focuses
on the dependency among the sensor dimensions and can produce a predicted label for each point. This provides the foundation for the quick-reaction online detection and other applications which require instantaneous detection. However,
this reuires a enough number of signal dimensions to carry
sufficient information for the aim of accurately recognition.

First, we propose a robust, universal, and adaptive classification framework which can efficiently deal with multimodality sensor data. Specifically, our approach works better
on high-dimensional feature space in that the information of
inter-dimension dependency is richer.
In addition, we propose a novel idea that adopts an alternative reward model to estimate and replace the original reward
model. In this way, the disadvantages of the original model,
such as expensive computation, can be eliminated. The key is
to keep the reward produced by the new model highly related
to the original reward. The higher correlation coefficient, the
better. This sheds light on the possible combination of deep
learning classifier and reinforcement learning.
Nevertheless, one weakness is that the reinforcement learning policy only works well in the specific environment in
which the model is trained. The dimension indices should

Conclusion

In this paper, we present a robust and efficient multi-modality
sensor data classification framework which integrates selective attention mechanism, deep reinforcement learning, and
WAS-LSTM classification. In order to boost the chance of
inter-dimension dependency in sensor features, we replicate
and shuffle the sensor data. Additionally, the optimal spatial dependency is required for high-quality classification, for
which we introduce the focal zone with attention mechanism.
Furthermore, we extended the LSTM to exploit the crossrelationship among spatial dimensions, which is called WASLSTM, for classification. The proposed approach is evaluated on three different sensor datasets, namely, EEG, RFID
and wearable IMU sensors. The experimental results show
that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.
Moreover, the designed reward model saves 98.3% of the
training time in reinforcement learning.
