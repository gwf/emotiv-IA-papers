Acta Colombiana de Psicología
Ernesto L. Ravelo-Contreras*

Dear readers of Acta Colombiana de Psicología,
In Vol. 22, No. 1, 2019, of the Acta Colombiana de
Psicología Journal we shared with our readers the contributions made by authors from institutions in different geographical zones, such as Universidad de Sevilla,
Universidad de Cádiz, and Universidad de Burgos, in Spain;
Universidad de San Francisco and Universidad Federal
de Santa Catarina, in Brazil; Universidad Veracruzana,
Universidad de Guadalajara, Instituto Tecnnológico de
Sonora, and Instituto Técnico Superior at Cajeme, in Mexico;
Universidad Católica del Perú; Universidad Academia de
Humanismo Cristiano, Universidad de Chile and Universidad
de Magallanes, in Chile; Universidad Nacional de Córdoba
and Universidad de Aconcagua, in Argentina; Universitat
Rovira i Virgil, in Cataluña; and Universidad Católica de
Colombia.
In particular, the reader will be able to come across two
descriptive cross-sectional researches in health psychology:
a study analyzing the anxiety levels and body discomfort,
the relation between these variables, and the differences
regarding gender among university students; and a research
whose objective was to describe how the family circle
functions: the couple’s mutual relationship, co-parenting
within the family and, in addition, how to identify them
among these variables, and the emotional and behavioral
problems faced by children 5 to 11 years old.
Five contributions can also be found as of the psychometric area: a study whose objective was the construction
and analysis of the psychometric properties of an abbreviated scale to avoid authoritarian tendencies, the Attitude
Scale in the face of Authoritarianism (ESCAUT, for its
Spanish acronym), followed by a work whose aim was
to develop a scale with robust psychometric properties to
measure the Moral Disconnection under School Bullying
Situations in Mexican Children (DMAE, for its Spanish
acronym); likewise, a study aiming to obtain evidence of
the construct validity (convergent and divergent) and of

criteria (sensibility, specificity, and predictive values) of
the Massie-Campbell Scale of Attachment under Stress; a
research pointing out that there are few studies that consider the effect of acquiescence in the construction of short
personality scales, so a search is being carried out for a
smaller scale (30 items), under public domain, to measure
the five great factors in the Latin American population and
which, in addition, controls the response bias and has items
representing the socio-cultural context; and finally, a work
that aims to adapt the Scale on the Sense of Community
(SCI-II) in schools, as of the revision of its psychometric
properties in a sampling obtained from an on-line platform.
Likewise, as of basic psychology, two experimental
researches are found: a study that carries out an experiment
to compare the effects of combining Incorrect-Nothing feedback versus the effects of Correct-Incorrect feedback, on
the execution of equalizing a generalized sampling within
a group of students; and a research designed in order to
investigate the effect of the type of training (observational or
instrumental) and the frequency of the request to elaborate
contingent post-contact descriptions during the training on
learning (percentage of achievements under training conditions), transfer (percentage of test achievements), and the
type of post-contact descriptions (specificity and relevance)
made by the participant in a second order matching –to
–sampling task with university students.
In addition, as regards educational psychology, a work
is found that proposes as its objective to analyze the relevance of different psycho-social and academic variables
in the explanation about the optimism with which students
face the start of their university studies.
On the other hand, as of the context of Psycho-biology,
a work is included with a retrospective ex post-facto design
within a quasi-control group that informs on the registry
in the cerebral electric activity (EEG) in attention tasks
(sustained and selective) in a group of multiple-consumer
adolescents, using a Brain Control Interface (BCI) Emotiv

EPOC research grade 14 Channel Mobile EEG equipment,
to register the brain’s electric activity, as well as the virtual
training program Cerebral “Brain HQ”, “Focusing my attention” module to evaluate attention.

Lastly, as of the organizational area, a contribution is
included which uses a descriptive correlational design in
order to identify the relations shown between labor life
quality and personality traits within a group of workers
from different enterprises.
