The published literature has produced several definitions for the sense of presence in
a simulated environment, as well as various methods for measuring it. The variety of
conceptualizations makes it difficult for researchers to interpret, compare, and evaluate
the presence ratings obtained from individual studies. Presence has been measured by
employing questionnaires, physiological indices, behavioral feedbacks, and interviews.
A systematic literature review was conducted to provide insight into the definitions and
measurements of presence in studies from 2002 to 2019, with a focus on questionnaires
and physiological measures. The review showed that scholars had introduced various
definitions of presence that often originate from different theoretical standpoints and
that this has produced a multitude of different questionnaires that aim to measure
presence. At the same time, physiological studies that investigate the physiological
correlates of the sense of presence have often shown ambiguous results or have not been
replicated. Most of the scholars have preferred the use of questionnaires, with Witmer
and Singer’s Presence Questionnaire being the most prevalent. Among the physiological
measures, electroencephalography was the most frequently used. The conclusions of
the present review aim to stimulate future structured efforts to standardize the use of the
construct of presence, as well as inspire the replication of the findings reported in the
published literature.

INTRODUCTION
Presence, which refers to the sense of “being there” in a simulated environment, is a critical concept
in the discussion of new technologies and mediated environments (Cummings and Bailenson,
2016). In the academic and industrial communities, there is often an underlying assumption that
the main goal for designing virtual environments (VEs, i.e., those environments generated by a
computer that simulate some characteristic of reality) is to promote a sense of presence. Cummings
and Bailenson (2016) noted that a heightened sense of presence enhances the user’s capacity for
interaction with the simulation. VEs have found applications in many fields, including clinical
therapy, training, learning, and entertainment, due to their capacity to elicit a high degree of
presence (Slater and Wilbur, 1997; Nunez and Blake, 2001; Tamborini and Skalski, 2006; Price and
Anderson, 2007).
A relatively recent analysis (Cummings and Bailenson, 2016) noted that the systematic
investigation of presence as a psychological phenomenon is quite new in the scientific literature.
The comprehensive works of Biocca (1997, 1999) are among the earliest scientific efforts aiming

physiological methods. Furthermore, it aims to update the
results of the comprehensive review on questionnaire use for
evaluating the sense of presence published by Hein et al.
(2018), as well as previous outdated works (see Insko, 2003)
that examined the physiological correlates of the sense of
presence. The present investigation asked the following. (1)
Which questionnaires and physiological methods have been
used together to evaluate the sense of presence? (2) What
are the advantages, possible problems, and criticalities of
using these methodologies? The answers to these questions
will hopefully promote the development of the field as
well as the development of a more unified and coherent
theoretical research framework for the scientific study of the
sense of presence.

to discuss specific characteristics of the sense of presence (such as,
e.g., the relationship between mind and embodiment in a virtual
medium, the sense of physical presence in a simulated space, and
the physical and social sense of presence). Only in the last two
decades, starting with the work of Lee (2004), has there been an
attempt to provide a more exhaustive explication of presence as
a psychological phenomenon by introducing concepts such as
social presence (the extent to which other entities presented in
the VE “are there” from the user point of view) and self-presence
(the sense of the user being able to perceive him/herself as part of
the VE).
Researchers have conceptualized the sense of presence in
different ways (e.g., Steuer, 1992; Slater and Wilbur, 1997; Witmer
and Singer, 1998; Slater, 1999; McMahan, 2003). Furthermore,
several terminologies (e.g., telepresence, mediated presence,
virtual presence) have been used to refer to the same notion (Lee,
2004). It is also common that the terminologies “presence” and
“immersion” are used as synonyms, primarily when used outside
the area traditionally covered by psychology (see, e.g., Jennett
et al., 2008; Cheng et al., 2015). Generally, the term presence
applies to a broad family of phenomena primarily experienced
during the use of VE, though this is also reported during the
use of different types of displays and immersive media. VE users
that experience a high sense of presence often report the feeling
of being in a different place than the position in space occupied
by their physical body (Slater et al., 1994). Some scholars have
proposed that the concept of presence should be treated as a type
of perceptual outsourcing or distal attribution (see Loomis, 1992).
It has been a challenge for researchers to develop a widely
accepted and unified notion of the phenomenon. Nevertheless,
Lee (2004) made a detailed effort, through a comprehensive
clarification process, to provide a coherent understanding and
a global description of presence (Makransky et al., 2017a). As
indicated by the work of Lee (2004), the experiences in real life
and those in VEs can be separated into three distinct domains:
physical, social, and self. With the term “physical experience,” Lee
(2004) refers to the experience of the physical environment and
the objects situated in the environment. The social experience
domain refers to the experience of other entities with social value
in the environment. The self-experience domain is applied to all
those experiences that the user has of him/herself.
Furthermore, Lee (2004) hypothesized two different paths
by which an experience can be defined as a virtual one. First,
an experience can be considered virtual when an artificial
technology mediates it. Such artificial technology allows the users
to have an experience of a mediated version of the natural,
physical space (as in the case of mixed reality). Another VE case
is when the human-made equipment enables the experience of
environments and entities that do not exist at all in the real world
[as in the case of virtual reality (VR)].
Several studies have explored the sense of presence and its
possible physiological correlates, but there is a lack of an overview
and critical analysis of the various methods. Furthermore, an
effort to replicate the findings reported in the literature is missing.
The present review intends to fill the gap through an
analysis of the various methodologies used for indexing the
sense of presence, with a focus on the questionnaire and

Terminological Clarifications
Defining what presence is and how related concepts can be
differentiated from it has posed challenges for researchers. The
constructs of immersion, involvement, and emotion are difficult
to disentangle from presence itself (Slater, 2003). Several studies
have considered the difference between these terms and related
constructs (Nacke and Lindley, 2008; Cummings and Bailenson,
2016; Suvajdzc et al., 2018). Generally, immersion refers to the
outcome of immersive technology when evaluated objectively
(Nilsson et al., 2016). Briefly, a system is more immersive
depending on the numbers and quality of delivering displays, in
all modalities, and preservation of visual fidelity that is similar
to the real world (Cummings and Bailenson, 2016). Technical
parameters are related to the level of immersion. Some examples
are the field of view, image latency, and frame rate of the
image stream (Slater, 1999). On the other hand, presence has
been defined as the subjective and psychological reaction to
immersive environments (Fromberger et al., 2015). As already
introduced in the previous section of the present article, some
studies have systematically used the terminology “immersion”
and “presence” as synonyms (e.g., Jennett et al., 2008; Amin et al.,
2016; Papachristos et al., 2017; Lum et al., 2018). In the present
review, the word “presence” will be preferred for the description
of the psychological and subjective feeling of being in a VE.
Presence and involvement can be logically separated into two
different psychological phenomena (Grabarczyk and Pokropski,
2016). As in the everyday experience, one can be involved in
something but not believe that one is present in it (for example,
while reading a book or watching a movie; Slater, 2003). Presence
involves a variety of emotions, and thus it can be measured by
examining the emotional reactions promoted by VE. As noted
by Riva et al. (2007), what someone sees may engage him/her
emotionally. However, emotional engagement does not qualify as
presence per se. Various studies have discussed the connection
between presence and emotion (Ijsselsteijn et al., 2000; Banos
et al., 2008).
Many scholars have used the terms VR and VE synonymously.
Although they share similarities, they differ in their context and
history (see Luciani and Cadoz, 2007). In the present review, VE
will be preferred to describe any immersive visual technology
(IVT), while VR will be used to describe those modern IVTs that
utilize head-mounted displays (HMD or VR headsets).

Questionnaires and Physiological Correlates of Presence

Presence and Human Performance

stage of research. A recent work (Pallavicini et al., 2019) showed
that the visualization of a VE using highly immersive media
increases both presence and emotional response. Nevertheless,
for some practical applications, especially in highly stressful work
scenarios, a high degree of presence and emotional involvement
in the simulation may not be a helpful factor, as emotionality may
be disadvantageous for training activities or for task performance
in VR.

The importance of studying the sense of presence goes beyond
mere scientific curiosity; such study is directly related to
applicable research. In this regard, several published studies
have revealed a positive relationship between presence and
human performance (Baumgartner et al., 2006; Baus and
Bouchard, 2017). Questionnaires evaluating the sense of presence
(e.g., PQ and SUS) showed it to positively correlate with
human performance, and the positive association between
questionnaire scores and user performance has been directly
used as an argument for a good predictive validity of the
questionnaire measures.
As noted by Serafin et al. (2016), presence is essential in
VEs because it easily influences the user’s behavior, and this
factor can be used to modulate the learning performance of
users when VEs are used for training. For instance, if the VE
is used to train professionals, such as surgeons and firefighters,
presence will be vital, since they are expected to perform in the
VE similarly to how they will perform in the real world. The
study by Stevens and Kincaid (2015) investigated the relationship
between performance and presence in virtual simulation training
and showed that a high level of presence during virtual training
correlates positively with an increase in user performance while
performing the trained task in real life.
However, there are some instances in which presence can
negatively affect performance (Sharples et al., 2008). A high
sense of presence correlates with simulator/cybersickness (Lin
et al., 2002), which is a collection of undesirable symptoms often
reported by users exposed to VE. However, please note that
cybersickness and presence are generally inversely correlated, as
reported by a recently published literature review (Weech et al.,
2019). Cybersickness negatively affects performance because it
triggers disorientation, nausea, and oculomotor symptoms in the
user, causing discomfort (Kennedy et al., 1993). Finally, presence
may not facilitate every type of performance. For instance, some
studies (Mania and Chalmers, 2001; Makransky et al., 2017b)
found no association or an inverse correlation between presence
and learning outcomes.
Moreover, the sense of presence may not be directly related to
task performance: task performance may be more associated with
the actual manipulation in the experimental scenario or related
to technical characteristics of the human-computer interface
(e.g., input lag, visual quality, et cetera). These characteristics,
even if connected with the sense of presence (i.e., we can
assume that better visual quality generally increases the sense
of presence), do not directly represent the subjective sense
of presence.
Performance in a VR scenario was directly investigated by
a recent study (Rose and Chen, 2018) using different degrees
of simulation vividness to modulate subjective presence in the
simulation. Nevertheless, the study did not find a relationship
between the quality of the simulation (and, consequently, the
level of reported presence) and actual (objectively measured) task
performance in the VR. Organizations that look to introduce the
use of VR into their work routine for training or performance
purposes are increasingly interested in studying the possible
advantages and disadvantages of the technology at the current

Measures of Presence
Various studies have attempted to measure presence in a
laboratory setting, and four main investigation methods (as
noted already by Hein et al., 2018) can be distinguished in
the literature: questionnaires, physiological measures, analysis
of the user’s behavior, and interviews. Baren and Ijsselsteijn
(2004) have presented a comprehensive list of the methods
(even though outdated). Questionnaires and physiology are
two typologies of measures for the assessment of the sense of
presence that are often used together. However, several factors
(e.g., the many questionnaires used to measure presence and
the lack of a standard for the analysis of physiological data),
have made a comparison between different studies challenging.
The present article tries to analyze the criticalities of using
those two methodologies, focusing on the published literature on
presence where questionnaires and physiological measures were
reported together.

Use of Questionnaires
Questionnaires are the most frequently used method for the
investigation of presence (see Hein et al., 2018). A standard
design employed in studies using questionnaires is to make the
experimental participant engage passively or actively in a VE
and later ask the participant to answer a survey that evaluates
his/her experience. Usually, the questions consist of ordinal scales
(e.g., Witmer and Singer, 1998; Lessiter et al., 2001). Some
presence questionnaires share similarities: for example, they use
a Likert scale that ranges from 1 and 7 [such as the Presence
Questionnaire (PQ), Igroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ),
and Slater-Usoh-Steed Questionnaire (SUS)]. Questionnaire
instruments have several advantages compared to other methods
of investigating presence. They are cheap, easy to administer, and
they are applicable regardless of the VE used. Questionnaires do
not require lengthy prior preparation, as other methodologies
do, and do not require specialized skills or scientific instruments
(as physiological measures). On the other hand, the numbers
of questionnaires measuring presence, the variety of constructs
explored by these questionnaires, and the overall lack of a
standard definition for presence as a psychological construct
may represent a problem on the use of this methodology.
Furthermore, results from studies using different questionnaires
may be difficult to compare (Kober and Neuper, 2013). Moreover,
questionnaires assessing the degree of presence are susceptible
to response bias: where a questionnaire poses queries about
presence directly or indirectly, it may possibly load an answer
that would not otherwise have reached the participants’ conscious
level (Szczurowski and Smith, 2017).

expensive and is generally used for clinical purposes, sometimes
only available within hospital infrastructures. The machinery
is complex to operate, and specialized medical staff are often
required for its correct operation and to limit possible usage
risks, further increasing its operational costs. Moreover, there are
some non-negligible risks and restrictions for the participants
of fMRI studies. For example, a participant cannot participate
in fMRI studies if he/she has permanent metal prostheses on
his/her body (or, e.g., a pacemaker), as the magnetic field of
the scanner may interact with the metal. Eventual presentation
of the stimuli (e.g., via VR goggles) needs to be mediated
by MRI-scan compatible equipment, i.e., not interacting with
magnetic fields. Additionally, the experiment is performed in
an unnatural lying-down position, and the head of the subject
needs to be immobilized, often causing discomfort. These
limitations make this methodology challenging to apply in most,
if not all, VEs.
Generally, brain-related physiological measures are
more expensive and less adaptable compared to non-brain
physiological measures. Several studies have explored the use
of galvanic skin response (GSR), also known as electrodermal
activity (EDA) or SC [sometimes in the literature as skin
conductance responses (SCRs)], which measures how the
electrical variations in the skin trigger eccrine sweat glands, a
phenomenon that allows SC measurement. In the present article,
the abbreviation “SC” will be used to refer to this methodology.
The use of SC is well-documented in the literature on human
emotion and cognition (Weber et al., 2009; Poels et al., 2012;
Chalfoun and Dankoff, 2018). SC is associated, for example, with
stress, excitement, engagement, and frustration, and arousal,
among other factors (see e.g., Kurniawan et al., 2013).
Furthermore, stimuli that promote attentional processes and
attention-demanding tasks relate to several characteristics of
the SC signal. SC data can be analyzed in several ways (e.g.,
decomposing phasic-transient and tonic activity), even though
researchers are still in the process of understanding the exact
meanings of those different components of SC (see Nagai et al.,
2004; Braithwaite et al., 2013; Dawson et al., 2017). SC is easy to
set up and minimally invasive, while SC sensors are affordable.
However, SC data are sensitive to movements (especially of the
part of the body where the sensors are attached) and to all
those activities that may modulate the activity of the eccrine
sweat glands. Furthermore, SC may not be an optimal proxy
for the measure of presence (based on the assumption that
arousal/excitement correlates with a higher sense of presence),
as SC modulation is highly dependent on the content of the
immersive experience. SC can also be significantly modulated by
external (often non-controlled) factors, like room temperature or
environmental humidity (Boucsein, 2012).
Heart rate (HR) has also been investigated as a possible
correlate of presence. In the present review, we do not focus
on the various HR analysis methods. However, the most used
methods in psychophysiological research are heart rate (HR) and
heart-rate variability (HRV). HR is the calculation/estimation of
the average heartbeats per timeframe (generally 1 min). HRV,
instead, is the measure (in milliseconds) of the changes (i.e.,
the variability) between successive heartbeats. This time period

Use of Physiological Measures
There have been numerous attempts to use human physiological
measures as indices for presence (e.g., Meehan et al., 2002; Arndt
et al., 2016), and several different types of measures have been
identified. These physiological indices can be coarsely divided
into two families: brain-related and not brain-related. Among
the brain-related measures, electroencephalography (EEG) is
one of the most commonly used within the field of cognitive
science and has found extensive use in relation to the sense of
presence (e.g., Terkildsen and Makransky, 2019). EEG measures
the electrical activity of the human brain in a passive and
non-invasive way: many neurons disposed perpendicularly to
the scalp and firing at the same time produce an electrical
potential that is possible to measure from outside the scalp
(Breedlove et al., 2010). EEG signals can be analyzed in several
different ways. Continuous EEG signals can be divided into
frequency bands (usually delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma),
and those oscillatory neural activities can be interpreted, for
example, in connection with human behavior and cognitive
processes (Teplan, 2002). Presence has been often investigated
using the EEG-based technique of event-related potentials (ERPs;
see Kober and Neuper, 2012; Terkildsen and Makransky, 2019).
ERPs represent brain activity generated as a response to an event
(a stimulation that can be, e.g., visual or auditory). This activity
is generally averaged across many samples (trials), in order to
reduce signal noise and obtain a reliable estimate for the brain
activity related to the response to the stimulation (Andreassi,
2010). The ERP methodology takes advantage of the good time
resolution (milliseconds) of the EEG recording and it is widely
used in cognitive research (attention, perception, consciousness,
etc.). However, EEG has somewhat imprecise signal localization
(low spatial resolution). EEG is sometimes also utilized to identify
the physical sources of brain signals and connectivity among
brain areas (see, e.g., Greicius et al., 2003), and this methodology
has also been implemented for the spatial individuation of the
physiological correlates of presence (Clemente et al., 2013b).
EEG offers several advantages. It is relatively affordable,
even for unspecialized laboratories. The latest developments of
portable consumer-grade equipment have made EEG equipment
cost-effective and easy to operate. However, the setup of the
equipment for the experimental phase is rather lengthy compared
with other methods, and data analysis requires specialized
expertise. Furthermore, the recording is somewhat sensitive to
movements, and data quality could be impaired in VEs where
movements are essential. For the latter reason, EEG is not
adaptable to all kinds of VEs.
A further brain-related physiological measure that is used for
the study of presence is functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI; Hoffman et al., 2003). fMRI is a brain imaging technique
that allows for spatially precise (millimeters) identification of
activity in the human brain. The fMRI scanner can identify the
flow of oxygenated blood in the brain in a relatively short amount
of time (seconds). This identification occurs due to bloodoxygenation-dependent imaging (BOLD), which highlights the
activated brain areas. However, the spatial precision of fMRI
comes at the cost of temporal resolution, which is much lower
than that of EEG (Huettel et al., 2004). Furthermore, fMRI is very

is called the R-R interval (inter-beat interval; van RavenswaaijArts et al., 1993). The experimental methodology generally
preferred for HR studies is electrocardiography (ECG or EKG).
ECG records changes in electrical potential associated with the
heartbeat (Goldberger, 1998). Due to its affordability compared
to ECG, PPG (photoplethysmography) was also used to measure
heart rhythm. The PPG can detect blood volume changes in
the microvascular tissue, and it is often measured using a pulse
oximeter, which illuminates the skin and can detect changes in
the light absorption and, with that, indirectly measures the heart
rhythm. Heart rate sensors are becoming increasingly cheap,
especially PPG sensors. HR is generally less affected by movement
than EEG and SC. On the other hand, PPG provides fewer
analysis possibilities compared to ECG, giving only the number
of heartbeats per time but without giving information on the beat
components. However, ECG is more expensive, more challenging
to operate, and more invasive than PPG.
Skin temperature (ST) is a rather simple experimental
methodology in which a sensor records the temperature of
the participant. Even though the use of skin temperature in
psychological research date back many years (see Maslach et al.,
1972) and has attracted attention in cognitive science research
due to its cost-effectiveness and simplicity of use (Lara et al.,
2018), this method has not found as many applications as the
other methodologies listed above.
Electromyography (EMG) is a technique for recording the
electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. Its setup is easy
and inexpensive. However, it finds limited application within
the field of cognitive psychology. As subject muscle activity
is strongly related to the EMG signal, it has been extensively
used in clinical and sports medicine (Steele, 2012). However,
due to its connection to subject behavior (muscle movements),
it has generally been less used to study cognitive phenomena
(with the exclusion of the quite widely used technique of facial
electromyography; see Durso et al., 2012). Its robust connection
with human behavioral responses makes this technique difficult
to use in many VR contexts.
While physiological measures could be more objective indices
of the level of presence experienced by a subject, there is no
consensus on which measure is the best to use. Furthermore,
many of these measures have methodological limitations (e.g.,
requiring the subject to be still, requiring a long preparation
time, and being costly) and therefore cannot be applied for all
situations and in all VEs.

of a button, as in the case of the evaluation of performance;
see Slater and Wilbur, 1997), or involuntary (e.g., motion in
reaction to an approaching object; see Sanchez-Vives and Slater,
2005) responses. However, these additional tasks or events may
be detrimental to the measure of presence. These tasks may not
be relevant for the VE, may disrupt the feeling of immersion, or
may interact with the VE in uncontrolled ways.

Interviews
Hein et al. (2018), in their review, reported that only one
study was found that made use of interviews without using a
questionnaire. However, even in that case, the presence factors
from the interview shared similarities with the typical items of
the Presence Questionnaire (PQ, Witmer and Singer, 1998).

METHODS
The methodology utilized here was a systematic literature review
of published research articles, following the guidelines stated in
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA;
see Liberati et al., 2009). The method used for the literature
review was based on that reported in the PRISMA checklist.
The first step defined the research questions and the setting
of the study protocol. Second, relevant research manuscripts
were identified, considering only papers authored during the
last two decades. Those articles were then screened in different
stages, based on their titles, abstracts, and keywords. Afterward,
a sub-sample of articles were selected, and their full texts were
evaluated. Finally, the information from the reviewed research
was summarized and categorized into the topic of interest for the
current review.

Inclusion Criteria and Search Strategy
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were established before the
literature review. The inclusion criteria focused on the factors
that it was important to evaluate when selecting an article
to be part of this review. They limited the articles based on
their research design, data, and focus. Research articles that
directly investigated the sense of presence were considered for
the analysis of measurement approaches to presence. Further
criteria were applied to target the articles of interest. First,
only papers published from January 2002 to August 2019 were
included in order to review the most current literature. This time
frame was chosen to not critically overlap with the analysis of
a similar review article published in 2003 (Insko, 2003) and to
report the current state-of-the-art research. Second, the reviewed
manuscripts had to contain an empirical study in which there was
some VE experienced by participants. Furthermore, only those
studies that reported first-hand experimental data were selected.
The search for relevant papers was conducted using some of
the most popular research engines for academic articles: Web of
Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. These scientific databases
were chosen for their popularity and for their comprehensive
and interdisciplinary nature, which fit the interdisciplinary topic
of the present review. Only articles in English were considered
for the present review. Only articles published in peer-reviewed

Behavioral Measures
A third approach for measuring presence is behavioral. It is a
sign of a higher level of presence when participants in a VE
behave as if they are in a real environment. Some examples of
this phenomenon include user behaviors related to conflicting
multisensory cues that emanate from both real and simulated
environments (Slater, 2002), postural sway (Freeman et al.,
2017), and responses to simulated stimuli (Bouchard et al.,
2008). Typically, behavioral measures require the introduction
of features or tasks into the environment to elicit behavioral
responses. For the behavioral approach to be applicable, the VE
must present features that trigger either voluntary (e.g., pressing

instrument for assessing presence were chosen. This design
allowed the assessment of the relationship between self-report
questionnaires and physiological measures. Articles that only
used physiological measures and not questionnaires to assess
presence were scarce in the literature (e.g., Bosse et al., 2016).
They lacked the subjective self-report component and thus failed
to clearly state their criteria for assessing the sense of presence.
Finally, twenty articles were included in the main result body
of the present literature review and are therefore presented
and summarized in Table 1. The first author of the present
review (S.G.) had the responsibility for selecting the articles
that were included in each stage of selection. However, both
authors participated in the discussion for identifying exclusion
and inclusion criteria. A PRISMA flow diagram is presented to
facilitate understanding of the review procedure (Figure 1).

journals or conference proceedings were selected during the
preliminary screening phase.
During the first stage, the keywords used for the search
included “virtual reality” AND “presence,” “virtual reality”
AND “immersion,” “virtual environment” AND “presence,” and
“virtual environment” AND “immersion.” For Web of Science,
the articles in the “Web of Science core collection” database
were searched. The queries made by using the “Topic” field,
which includes title, abstract, and keywords. Both published
articles and conference proceedings were searched for. After
the preliminary screening, the results obtained included 3,466
articles. To narrow down the results, the articles were filtered for
the categories “Neurosciences,” “Psychology multidisciplinary,”
“Psychology applied,” “Psychology experimental,” “Psychology,”
and “Psychology biological.” After duplications from every
query were eliminated, the number of articles included in the
preliminary selection from Web of Science was 371.
For Scopus, the queries were run on the article title, abstract,
and keywords of published scientific articles. After the first
screening, 6,546 were retrieved. The subject areas “Psychology”
and “Neurosciences” were selected to pre-screen those articles.
After the filters were applied, 651 results were retrieved.
For Google Scholar, each combination of keywords was
queried separately, and the first 10 pages of resulting titles
were manually reviewed for each one of the queries. Each page
contained 10 results, and the results were sorted by relevance. A
total of 140 articles were selected.
The retrieved articles from the three search engines were
then imported into Endnote software, and duplicate entries
were removed. A total of 875 unique articles were identified.
The titles of these articles were screened to distinguish papers
fitting the topic of investigation, and 205 articles were selected
in the preliminary screening phase. Preliminary screening of
keywords, titles, and abstracts was performed to filter the
articles further. From this further screening, 120 papers were
selected. The full abstract of these articles was then evaluated for
inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 59 articles were included
for full-text evaluation. Of these articles, only those that used a
combination of questionnaires and physiological methods were
included. Furthermore, only those articles that clearly attempted
to measure presence were selected. Studies that were judged to
be clinically oriented and made use of specific subject samples
(e.g., people with specific health conditions) were also excluded.
Finally, 18 articles were included in the review. The scientist that
worked on the selection of the article did not have any conflicts
of interest in evaluating the inclusions. However, a degree of
subjectivity in choosing the inclusion/exclusion criteria as well
as selecting the articles fitting those criteria may have affected the
selection of the articles included in the final phase of the review
(e.g., the ability of the responsible author, S.G., to understand the
methodologies in sufficient detail and evaluate their pertinence
to the topic of the present review). This represents a limitation to
the systematicity of the present review.
Table 1 provides a summary of the papers evaluated, including
authors and year, measure(s) used for assessing presence, and the

RESULTS
The study results are presented in the following paragraphs. They
are firstly analyzed regarding the questionnaires used, and in
the following section of the review, regarding the physiological
measures. A critical overview of the measures and the main
findings of the analyzed articles is also presented.

Questionnaires
The most utilized method for evaluating presence is by selfreporting questionnaire (Hein et al., 2018). According to the
articles selected for the current review, the most commonly
used questionnaires were the PQ, SUS, ITQ, and MEC Spatial
Presence Questionnaire (MEC-SPQ). The PQ was by far the most
frequently used self-report measure in the analyzed literature, a
result that confirms the findings of the literature review by Hein
et al. (2018). Schubert et al. (2001) already noted a few years after
its introduction that the PQ questionnaire was widely used in a
variety of different fields, including studies on general presence,
social presence, simulations, storytelling, and games. The SUS
Questionnaire was the second most used questionnaire in the
body of literature analyzed.
Other studies used less conventional questionnaires, such
as the Modified Reality Judgment and Presence Questionnaire
(MRJPQ; Anderson et al., 2017), IPQ (Schubert et al., 2001),
University College of London Questionnaire (UCLQ; Usoh et al.,
1999; Meehan, 2001), and Multimodal Presence Scale (MPS;
Makransky et al., 2017a). Several studies preferred simpler scales
(e.g., Hoffman et al., 2003), constituted by a single item that
queried the general sense of presence. Some studies used a
combination of questionnaires, and the results from different
measures of presence correlated, as was the case for the PQ
and SUS (Salanitri et al., 2016; Skarbez et al., 2017). One of
the studies analyzed (Lee et al., 2017) employed a specific
questionnaire (in addition to the PQ) that aimed to evaluate
social presence (Social Presence Questionnaire, Bailenson et al.,
2003). However, the results of the two questionnaires were not
directly compared.
There are many other questionnaires that have had some
resonance in the literature but were not presented in the
current literature review because they are not associated with

there are other studies that considered more specific measures
of what is referred to as “spatial presence” (MEC-SPQ; Vorderer
et al., 2004). The sense of “spatial presence” was specifically
defined as the feeling of being present within the physical body,
as well as feeling able to interact in the VE (Lee, 2004). Sohre et al.
(2017) also used a customized questionnaire to evaluate attention

physiological measures in the published research body. For
example, the E2 I Questionnaire has been adopted in studies
that emphasized the role that enjoyment has in presence (Lin
et al., 2002). Following the same rationale, Frommel et al. (2017)
explored enjoyment as a vital part of the VE, including enjoyment
items in a modified version of the PQ questionnaire. Similarly,

and Singer, 1998). A recent effort to build a unitary scale for the
measurement of various aspects of presence was made with the
development of the MPS (Makransky et al., 2017a). This effort
represents a step toward a standard and widely accepted measure
of presence for various types of VEs. The scale attempts to
assess the three major senses of presence in virtual environments
(Lee, 2004): physical presence (like several previously reported
scales, including PQ and SUS), social presence, and self-presence.
Another major advantage of the MPS scale is its clear theoretical
standpoint (Lee, 2004), which has been validated by multiple
experiments according to tests performed using modern test
theories (i.e., confirmatory factor analysis, as described in Brown,
2014) and the Item Response Theory (as described in Embretson
and Reise, 2013).
It is worth noting that the current review may not adequately
represent the entire literature published in the last two decades,
as several factors may have influenced the selection criteria
of the sample of articles included. Therefore, the prominence
of the measures of presence that were distinguished may
not be generalized outside the sample of articles analyzed
here. However, our findings (e.g., the PQ as the most-used
questionnaire) are coherent with previously published reviews
(see Hein et al., 2018). Figure 2 presents an overview of
the prevalence of questionnaires used in association with
physiological measures.

(and, specifically, spatial presence). Witmer and Singer (1998)
published the Immersive Tendencies Questionnaire (ITQ), which
is a modification of the PQ they had designed earlier. The
researchers used this questionnaire in combination with the PQ
in several studies (Witmer and Singer, 1998; Skarbez et al., 2017).
Overall, the published research evidenced the use of a
wide variety of questionnaires in association with physiological
measures. Furthermore, when their items are more closely
analyzed, these questionnaires were found to differ significantly
in terms of scope and details. In principle, the questionnaires
aim to quantify the same construct (presence), but intrinsic
differences exist due to the designer’s conceptualizations of
presence, as noted by Slater (1999) in his critique of Witmer
and Singers’ PQ. Of the questionnaires presented in the reviewed
literature, the majority aims to explore the concept of “physical
presence” (PQ, SUS, IPQ, and MRJQ); however, the way physical
presence is described varies among the instruments. The PQ
questionnaire emphasizes the “involvement” and “immersion”
characteristics of the simulated environment, while the SUS and
IPQ are focused on the sense of “being there” (i.e., the sense
that the experienced VE may be part of the reality). The MECSPQ questionnaire analyzes what is called “spatial presence,”
specifically in the framework of the MEC Two-Level Model
of Spatial Presence (Vorderer et al., 2003). The latter model
theorizes a clear separation between the constructs of presence,
involvement, and attention, and factors such as involvement,
self-location, and the possibility of performing real action in
the VE. Other questionnaires are less clear about the theoretical
model they follow. For instance, the Immersive Experience
Questionnaire (IEQ) does not directly discuss a model in its
theoretical formulation but elaborates more generally about
theories of cognitive involvement, absorption, and flow (Jennett
et al., 2008). In contrast, the MPS questionnaire clearly states
its theoretical starting point as Lee’s (2004) theory, as well as
the types of presence assessed in its inventory (physical, social,
and self-presence). A detailed overview of the questionnaires
reviewed in the present review is given in Table 2.
With the proliferation of technologies that aim to simulate
interactions between people and environments, there is a need
to evaluate presence metrics to build measurements that can
consistently predict the sense of presence of the users (based on
a unified theory). Thus, developing questionnaires to measure
presence properly is still an ongoing scientific endeavor. Factor
analysis was used in the analyzed articles to test the construct
validity of the MPS, IPQ, and IEQ specifically reported in that
article. The predictive validity of the questionnaires is sometimes
stated in the original article. As reported in Table 2, this
factor was most commonly assessed by measuring the positive
correlation with various types of task performance (PQ and SUS).
However, the later work of Youngblut and Huie (2003) found
inconclusive evidence for the ability of those questionnaires to
predict task performance in VEs.
Items for many of the analyzed questionnaires were
sometimes unclear or difficult to grasp for a naïve participant,
e.g., “How is your memory of the scenario similar to being in real
places?” (SUS; Slater and Steed, 2000) or “How compelling was
your sense of objects moving throughout space?” (PQ; Witmer

Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org

Physiological Measures
Psychophysiological studies use a variety of instruments to
evaluate the relationship between psychological and physical
states in both experimental and naturalistic settings. In tandem
with modern brain image methods, psychophysiological
approaches have enhanced the understanding of the
interplay between physiological indices and several human
cognitive processes.
Numerous studies aimed to find physiological measures that
correlate with the self-reported sense of presence, using a
variety of methodologies. The published research shows a variety
of physiological measures that correlate with subjective selfreport of presence. EEG was commonly analyzed using both
spectral signal decomposition and ERPs. The ERP paradigms
commonly assessed presence indirectly, specifically by studying
the attentional processes allocated toward the simulated vs. the
“external” real environment. In order to do so, the researchers
used a traditional auditory dual-task oddball paradigm. In
this paradigm, a series of frequent, repeated auditory tones
are followed by less frequent tones of a different pitch, a
phenomenon that generates a cognitive mismatch in the listener.
This experimental design is often used in the study of subjective
awareness, in combination with EEG (Näätänen et al., 2019).
Burns and Fairclough (2015) used the Kober and Neuper
(2012) paradigm in their study and found that task difficulty
significantly increases immersion. They also replicated the
connection between slow-wave amplitude in response to oddball
auditory stimuli and sense of presence. However, the recent
work of Terkildsen and Makransky (2019), who employed a very
similar study design to both Kober and Neuper (2012) and Burns
and Fairclough (2015), did not replicate their findings. Instead,

these authors reported an earlier ERP component correlated with
presence (N1 and MMN). Clemente et al. (2014) used EEG to
measure presence for navigation in virtual environments, using
consumer-grade EEG equipment (Emotive EPOC EEG).
Only a limited number of fMRI studies (three) were found
in the literature (one of which did not report detailed findings;
Hoffman et al., 2003), reporting only partially coherent results.
Among the non-brain physiological indices, presence was
found to positively correlate with SC activity (Baumgartner et al.,
2006; Kim et al., 2012), but Meehan et al. (2002) reported only a
weak association and suggested that HR is a better correlate for
presence. Furthermore, Terkildsen and Makransky (2019) found
that the sense of presence may differently modulate different SC
components: SC peaks/minima are good predictors of the sense
of presence, while SC response magnitude shows no association
with it. Another study (Lee et al., 2017) found no association
between presence and SC (using the sum of skin responses for
each of the three conditions employed in their experiment).
HR was found to be one of the most reliable indices of
presence among the physiological indices, and it can be compared
directly with other physiological measures (Meehan et al., 2002),
except in the case of the study of Busscher et al. (2011),
which found negative correlation between HR and presence in
a simulated flight scenario. The authors of the latter article
proposed that the average lower heart rate during the virtual
flight (compared to a neutral VE condition), could reflect
participant coping mechanisms. A similar reduction in HR has
been observed in other studies presenting stressful stimuli (Bosch
et al., 2001; Busscher et al., 2010). Furthermore, analysis of HR
variability (Anderson et al., 2017) was shown not to be a reliable
index of the sense of presence. Some studies analyzed in this
review (e.g., Pallavicini et al., 2019) explicitly did not use HR to
study presence per se, but rather, they used it to index connected
factors, such as emotional responses.
One study investigated ST as a possible index of presence
(Meehan et al., 2002); even though the authors expected skin
temperature to be an index for enhanced presence in their more
highly arousing experimental condition (according to previous
investigations using sense of height as exposure; see Andreassi,
Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org

2010), there was no connection between the phenomena.
Unfortunately, the use of ST as a possible index of presence was
not found in other articles included in the present review. More
studies are needed to gain a better understanding of ST as an
index for presence. One study also combined EMG with SC to
assess the sense of presence (Poels et al., 2012). The results of
the EMG confirmed those from SC. However, in the context of
the study of Poels et al. (2012), EMG was used as a measure of
arousal and not of presence. Unfortunately, such a finding was
not replicated nor attempted by other studies, and therefore it
is challenging to give an interpretation to it. For an overview of
the number of uses of physiological measures in the reviewed
articles, see Figure 3. The prevalence of the psychophysiological
indices reported in the present review may be characteristic of
the sample of studies retrieved and may be difficult to generalize
when also considering studies that have been excluded from the
current review.

DISCUSSION
In the present review, articles from the last two decades that
examined both questionnaires and physiological measures for
the assessment of the sense of presence in VEs were analyzed.
The PQ was the most often-used instrument. This review
showed that a wide range of questionnaires had been developed
and utilized for assessing presence. Furthermore, it was noted
that those questionnaires, even if they aimed to measure the
same constructs, are rooted in several different theorizations of
presence. Indeed, they have a very different number of items
and use a variety of distinct sub-scales. These scales, however,
seem to generally correlate with one another (e.g., PQ with SUS
and PQ with ITQ). Construct validity of the scales was generally
assessed by reviewing the already existing literature; sometimes,
factor analysis (IEQ or MPS) was utilized to assess it. Human
performance was used directly to validate the effectiveness of the
most-used scales (but see Youngblut and Huie, 2003).
A wide range of physiological measures was used together
with questionnaires, attempting to identify physiological
correlates of the sense of presence. The most prevalent measure

in the retrieved literature was EEG. The attempts to use SC
and HR or to exploit other cognitive phenomena during
EEG recordings to assess the sense of presence have revealed
mixed results. Even though many studies explored the sense
of presence, many criticalities were identified in the present
literature review. The study of presence is made complex by the
degree of subjectivity of the construct, the different modalities
of inducing presence (and their evolution over the years), and
the difficulties related to the communication of the feeling of
presence (Slater, 2004; Sanchez-Vives and Slater, 2005; Oh and
Rosakranse, 2014; Cummings and Bailenson, 2016).
Presence is the sensation of being in the place presented in
a VE (Nash et al., 2000). It is characterized by the illusion that
the virtual events are real, and it is fundamental to determine
the extent of presence in those simulated environments (Slater
et al., 1994). The “illusion” or “feeling” of presence is highly
subjective, and there is no developed and generally accepted
method for its evaluation. As shown in the present review,
researchers have used markedly different means to measure the
phenomenon, such as questionnaires featuring widely different
items and a variety of physiological responses. Furthermore,
findings from the physiological responses were obtained using
a variety of methodologies and diverse phenomena within
the same methodology (e.g., brain wave oscillation analysis
vs. event-related potentials; peak amplitude analysis vs. overall
skin conductance).
Measuring presence using questionnaires is justified by the
fact that it is a subjective concept (Nichols et al., 2000). As such,
questionnaires are commonly considered the most appropriate
measure for a person’s subjective experience. Previous studies
demonstrated that experiments for evaluating presence using
questionnaires employ manipulative aspects of VE. In most cases,
the responses are based on Likert scales (Nichols et al., 2000;
Lessiter et al., 2001; Slater et al., 2010). As noted in the study
by Lessiter et al. (2001), a variety of questionnaires are utilized,
and they are often based on different definitions of presence.
The present review attempted to clarify and summarize the
characteristics of the most used questionnaires (see Table 2). As

already evidenced in the Results section, those questionnaires
utilized many different theorizations of the construct of presence,
for example, the theory of multidimensionality of presence of Lee
(2004) employed by the MPS, and the theories of cognitive flow
(see, e.g., Agarwal and Karahanna, 2000) used by the MRJPQ.
This has created an astonishing number of measures for presence;
see the criticism of the proliferation of questionnaires assessing
presence by Nordin et al. (2014) and the comprehensive (but
outdated) list of presence questionnaires presented by Baren and
Ijsselsteijn (2004).
There are several benefits with psychophysiological measures,
in case reliable ways to measure the sense of presence with
only physiological measures are identified. These benefits include
the possibility of continuous data collection and, therefore, the
ability to study the association of physiological activity with the
effect of a contemporary stimulus presentation in experimental
paradigms. Psychophysiology can also help in the investigation
of phenomena that are difficult to capture using self-report
methods. Thus, this modality will provide a more accurate
analysis of the physiological state of a person compared to
questionnaires or bare behavior.
Consumer-oriented, cost-effective, small, and easy to handle
EEG systems are now available and have already been used
for the study of the sense of presence (Clemente et al., 2013b;
Tarrant et al., 2018). However, even though validation against
medical- or research-grade equipment has been undertaken
(see, e.g., Badcock et al., 2013), these consumer-oriented EEGs
have been shown to record a less reliable signal compared to
their—generally more expensive—professional counterparts (see
Duvinage et al., 2012, 2013). Therefore, results from studies that
utilize these tools may generally be more inaccurate and difficult
to replicate. Furthermore, EEG (with regards to the study of
presence) is often used by employing very different experimental
paradigms and methodologies that are impossible to compare
directly. Additionally, as in the case of the recent study of
Terkildsen and Makransky (2019), some published results are
difficult to replicate, even when employing almost identical
paradigms. However, it is worth noting that Terkildsen and

sensitive to the content of the simulation, and its use for the study
of presence may be impaired.
While fMRI and EEG are more likely, in the future, to pinpoint
specific brain-related activity patterns or areas directly involved
(or highly correlated) with the sense of presence (as in the
somewhat related field of awareness; see Koivisto and Grassini,
2016; Koivisto et al., 2016, 2017; Jimenez et al., 2018), SC and
HR are more likely to identify secondary effects of presence, as
well as experiences modulated by or together with presence, such
as, for example, arousal, emotion, and stress (Poels et al., 2012;
Chalfoun and Dankoff, 2018). Furthermore, there are myriad
data collection and data analysis modalities for SC (SCR, SCL,
and GSR peak amplitude/number, just to cite a few), and this
makes the comparison of the various methodologies that employ
SC almost impossible.
Methodological problems in the study of presence include
over-reliance on the use of the self-evaluating questionnaires and
the difficulty in understanding and elaborating the questionnaire
items for the naïve participants involved in the experiments.
Additionally, questionnaire methods only allow presence in VEs
to be evaluated in a non-invasive manner and only after the
experience, while attempting to do it during the experience
comes at the cost of breaking the participant’s sense of presence.
Thus, an approach to indirectly measure presence via, for
instance, non-invasive and reliable physiological measurements,
would be ideal for understanding the ongoing presence level
of the users without the need to query them about their
subjective feelings and interrupting their immersive experience
to collect data.
Physiological measures may provide numerous advantages
compared to other types of measures in the future, for
example, continuous, non-invasive, real-time, and relatively
objective assessment (Kavikanga et al., 2011). Unfortunately,
these measures are difficult to use alone in the current state
of research due to the lack of verified and easily replicable
physiological indices of presence that are highly correlated
with self-reports. Furthermore, several problems are present in
the use of physiological measures compared to questionnaire
instruments to assess presence. Recording equipment is very
sensitive to motion (EEG, SC, and HR), and, in fMRI, motion
by the subject is not allowed at all due to technical constraints.
Therefore, not all experimental scenarios will be suitable for
those methods.
Moreover, VE content can affect the recorded data and thus
constitute an uncontrollable variable when comparing among
different experimental settings. It may be challenging to isolate
the phenomena of “presence” per se, as many other cognitive or
perceptive factors (e.g., emotional charge of the environment,
arousal of the subject, and image quality) may profoundly
influence the physiological data. Only systematic replicative
efforts of published studies, as well as future investigations that
aim to isolate the phenomenon of presence and reduce the
influence of confounding factors, can help to identify reliable
physiological correlates of presence. An optimal physiological
correlate of presence should be able to discriminate the level
of the user’s presence with a high correlation with self-reported
questionnaires and independently from the content of the
VE experience.

Makransky (2019) used the MPQ to assess subjectively reported
presence, a measure that shows essential differences compared
to the questionnaire used in previous studies that employed the
same paradigm (SUS and PQ in Kober and Neuper, 2012; IEQ in
Burns and Fairclough, 2015). On the positive side, Tauscher et al.
(2019) studied the methodological feasibility and analyzed the
possibility of using EEG equipment combined with VR headsets.
They validated the possibility of combining these methods and
reported a relatively small and predictable interference (easy
to clean) from the VR headset with the recorded signal. As
Millán et al. (2010) noted, EEG is widely implemented in the
development of brain-computer interface (BCI), and therefore it
is expected that in the next decades the use of this methodology
will grow exponentially in the tech sector and possibly in the
study of brain activity during immersive experiences.
The few fMRI studies reported in the literature appear to
generally agree on the involvement (negative correlation) of the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the experience of the sense
of presence and on the role of the insula. However, Clemente
et al. (2013a) reported the inactivation of the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex in a different, inferior location compared to
Baumgartner et al. (2008). Related brain areas were also shown
to activate in EEG studies (Clemente et al., 2013b). However,
the source localization attempt carried out in the EEG study
of Clemente et al. (2013b) was conducted with a sub-optimal
configuration: the researchers used data from low-density (14channel) consumer-oriented EEG equipment to perform signal
source-localization analysis (see Staljanssens et al., 2017; Michel
and Brunet, 2019) and with a small participant sample (10).
Further studies are needed for a more precise spatial localization
of the phenomenon and to confirm it. The activation of the insula
is related to cognition and behavior, as for emotion, regulation
of the body’s homeostasis, perception, motor control of hands
and eyes, self-awareness, cognitive functions, and interpersonal
experience (Karnath et al., 2005; Craig, 2009; Clemente et al.,
2014). Self-awareness, sense of agency, and sense of body
ownership are essential in this context, as directly linked with
the sense of presence. Attentional and behavioral components
are crucial for the development of the sense of presence,
such as increasing the ability to understand the dynamics,
predict, and interact with the VE (Sjölie, 2012). Clemente et al.
(2013a) acknowledged that their interpretation of the data was
speculative and that the brain areas activated during their VE
navigation task are possibly not directly related to the sense of
presence per se.
The reviewed literature showed that little effort had been
made to replicate the physiological indices proposed for the
feeling of presence, despite the ambiguous results sometimes
reported and the variety of different methods used for indexing
the phenomenon. When replication was deliberately attempted,
the early results were not always successful (Terkildsen and
Makransky, 2019). SC and HR studies generally showed more
consistent findings, with a higher level of immersion correlating
with greater SC or increased HR. However, Busscher et al. (2011)
reported a negative correlation between HR and presence and
proposed this to be a result of the “conservation-withdrawal”
(see Bosch et al., 2003) coping response to a more arousing
VE experience. If this interpretation is correct, HR may be very

Questionnaires and Physiological Correlates of Presence

Immersive media are currently used as a popular source of
entertainment (Williams and Mascioni, 2017). It is, therefore,
important to comprehensively evaluate the user experience,
and the sense of presence is often used as an index of
quality for virtual environments. Additionally, understanding
and measuring presence has become necessary due to the
various applications of virtual reality in different fields, as
noted by Schuemie et al. (2001). Furthermore, several studies
demonstrated that presence could be a crucial factor to consider
when using VE outside the entertainment context, for example,
as a training tool in work environments or to increase the
performance of users (Baumgartner et al., 2006; Baus and
Bouchard, 2017).

et al., 2011). A combination of different types of measures (e.g.,
questionnaire, behavioral, and physiological), may be, in the
current state, the better approach for properly evaluating the
sense of presence in a VE.
Physiological measures, especially SC and EEG, showed
widespread use. However, despite contrasting results in the
literature, little effort has been invested in systematically
replicating already published studies. In this regard, when
talking about new technology, it is essential to acknowledge
that technical progress evolves very quickly, and several of the
reviewed studies were conducted more than a decade ago. Thus,
their findings may have still-relevant but limited implications
for recent technology (modern high-definition, more immersive
VEs). As such, more studies should be performed based on
current technology and devices. Furthermore, some studies
should aim to replicate old findings using new devices.
This line of research can help with the development of a
more comprehensive theoretical framework for presence and
related constructs.
Future research should also focus on the role of presence
in shaping human performance. The role of presence in new
media and its relationship with user performance may be of great
interest for applied research in the field of IVTs. More empirical
research is needed to understand better how the sense of presence
(and related factors, e.g., emotional involvement) may represent
a positive or a negative factor for human performance, depending
on different uses of IVTs. The authors of the present review wish
to stimulate the replication of the published scientific research
on the physiological correlates of presence, especially in those
cases where the published studies have reported conflicting or
inconclusive results. At the same time, this review underlines
the theoretical problems with the definition of presence as a
psychological construct.

CONCLUSIONS
The present review analyzed the body of scientific literature
on the measurement of the sense of presence published during
the last two decades. The analyzed studies were selected from
those reporting both physiological and questionnaire data. In
the introduction of the present review, emphasis was placed
on clarifying the most common definitions and propositions
for presence and related concepts. Furthermore, the review
replicated and updated the results of the comprehensive review
on questionnaires used for evaluating the sense of presence
published by Hein et al. (2018), as well as previous work (Insko,
2003) that examined the physiological correlates of the sense
of presence.
Overall, there was no standard measurement method for
presence, even though there is a growing body of literature that
compares various measurement constructs. One of the most
important findings reported in this review is the reliance on
the use of questionnaires (and the diversity of questionnaires).
Considering that in the coming years, VR technology users will
probably increase in number, there is a need for research on
standard practices and standardization in the area to understand
the effect of those technologies on the end-user, as well as to help
in the development of better ones in the future.
At the current state of research, no physiological measure has
collected enough evidence to be considered “good enough” to
be reliably used alone, without the user giving their subjective
evaluation of the experience. The nowadays quite outdated
study of Meehan et al. (2002) compared several non-brain
physiological measures and showed that HR may be a better
measure than SC and ST. Other studies have also shown the
generally acceptable reliability of HR for evaluating presence.
However, the measure was found not to be reliable when HR
variability analysis was attempted (Anderson et al., 2017) and was
shown to be possibly too sensitive to the content of the VE to be
successfully used in emotional/arousing VE scenarios (Busscher
