ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

While the pages that follow will likely be read many more times than this page, this
page is the most important to me. It is my opportunity to thank with all my heart the
individuals that have made me getting a doctorate possible. First and foremost, I would like
to thank my partner, Greg Harris, who was there for me every step of the way, including the
tears, joys, excitement and frustration always saying “you’ve got this” along the way.
Next, I am eternally grateful to the chair of my committee, Alan Dennis whose
guidance and insight I will always be indebted to and will play no small part in whatever
success might happen from here. Further, I would like to thank Rob Potter who was the first
person to teach me how to attach corrugator and skin conductance sensors and was always
cheerful and positive when I needed it in the analysis and write-up stages of projects. Vijay
Khatri has taught me to step outside the world of virtual teams and think more deeply about
the entire research process. Finally, Tom James whose class on neuroimaging helped me
understand all the false discovery rate corrections done in this dissertation (along with the
importance of fMRI research).
I would also like to thank advisors from the past. Sohee Park was instrumental in
inspiring me to pursue science and furthering our knowledge. Her lab was the foundation for
my neuroscience training, which I will always be thankful for. I would also like to thank
Jeffrey Harper who sparked my interest in Information Systems and encouraged me to pursue
my doctorate. I would also like to thank all the students in the doctoral program at Kelley,
which have helped me stay grounded through an amazing experience.
Finally, I would like to thank my parents and family, whose love and guidance have
gotten me to the finish line (or perhaps better stated as the real starting line). Without your
support, this document and degree would not have been possible.

DESIGNING FOR THE SUBCONSCIOUS: A NEUROIS STUDY OF PRIMING AND
IDEA GENERATION IN ELECTRONIC BRAINSTORMING
There has been extensive research on electronic brainstorming (EBS) over the
past two decades, yet little is known about how best to design technology to enhance
overall team performance. This dissertation seeks to open a new door in EBS design:
designing a system for the individual’s subconscious. Before effective design
interventions can be developed, the cognitive underpinnings of individual-level EBS
interactions must be elucidated. These studies provide insight into the core of this issue
by examining the neurophysiological correlates of the ideation process, specifically using
electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and skin conductance to
examine priming-induced changes in cognition and emotion during an EBS session.
Furthermore, it extends prior research on the use of priming to enhance EBS
performance, creating new design guidelines for EBS systems that are designed for the
user’s subconscious. The findings show that achievement priming changes cognition in
areas of the brain related to creativity which correspond with increases in idea fluency
and creativity. While the implications of this study will be directly applicable to design of
EBS technology, future studies can examine the use of priming in other collaboration
tools. There may also be implications for the design of other forms of technology. The
use of NeuroIS to more fully understand information processing in teams can also
enhance the collaboration literature, in that it can illuminate individual cognition
limitations in team interactions and enhance our understanding of which aspects of team
interactions have the biggest “bang for their buck” from a cognitive standpoint. These
findings provide several avenues for future research.

INTRODUCTION
Introduction
Virtual teams are common in today’s organization and have been the primary focus of
much research. Much of the research has targeted design interventions meant to improve
team-level processes, but few design interventions have been aimed at alleviating the
cognitive limitations of individual team members, which may have important impacts on
team performance (Heninger et al. 2006). Recent studies have attempted to understand
the role of individual cognition in team processes (Kolfschoten 2011a; Kolfschoten and
Reinig 2012). Some studies have influenced subconscious cognition through priming
(Dennis et al. 2013; Postmes et al. 2001), while others have examined conscious
cognitive processes such as dual-task interference (Heninger et al. 2006). These studies
have found that the cognitive processes of individual team members are inextricably
linked to overall team performance.
One form of collaboration technology used by virtual teams is electronic
brainstorming (EBS). EBS system design was influenced heavily in the 1990s by
research on process gains and losses, aimed at enhancing team processes not individual
cognition (e.g., Dennis et al. 1996; Nunamaker et al. 1996). Current design guidelines for
EBS systems remain similar to those of twenty years ago: a text-based chat tool that
provides increased parallelism and anonymity compared to face-to-face discussions
(Briggs et al. 2009; Mametjanov et al. 2011).
This dissertation opens a new door in EBS design: designing a system for the
individual’s subconscious. More specifically, I created a system to enhance an individual
team member’s cognition by activating a subconscious desire to “achieve,” thus
improving the idea generation performance of the overall team. My research builds on
1

recent research that attempted to influence subconscious cognition to enhance EBS
performance (see, Dennis et al. 2013; Postmes et al. 2001). In Dennis et al (2013),
findings show that supraliminal priming of the concept “achievement” substantially
increases fluency and creativity of ideas generated in a brainstorming session.
Supraliminal priming is a behavioral intervention intended to activate an individual’s
internal mental representations (Bargh and Chartrand 2000). A variety of concepts and
emotional states have been evoked using supraliminal priming, such as success,
motivation, positive affect, negative affect, and mindfulness (Bargh and Chartrand 2000).
Dennis et al (2013) found the use of supraliminal, scrambled-sentence priming of the
concept “achievement” at the individual level improves EBS performance of the entire
virtual team. The effect size of priming was as large as the effect size observed in using
EBS technology itself (Dennis et al. 2013). However, in this study they used traditional,
“a priori” priming, which requires an artificial 8-minute priming session prior to the
brainstorming session.
The first goal of this dissertation is to better understand how priming influences the
behavior of individual team members participating in an EBS discussion. There are two
potential routes that need to be further examined. One route is that achievement priming
affects individual cognition, which in turn influences individual behavior and overall
team performance. The second route is through emotion, namely that achievement
priming influences individual emotion which in turn influences individual behavior and
team performance. Neither of these routes are mutually exclusive and it is possible that
priming influences individual behavior through an interaction of both of the routes.

2

In Dennis et al. (2013) the authors propose that individual cognition is affected
through priming. However, this study did not propose a potential role of emotion on
individual behavior. In addition, the authors did not discuss the processes by which the
change in cognition occurred. This dissertation provides a clear understanding of how
priming influences cognition and emotion, giving a holistic picture of how priming
influences individual behavior. This understanding also helps illuminates how to create
effective primes that enhance team performance. To do this, I used of a combination of
electroencephalography (EEG) and psychophysiological measures, including
electromyography (EMG) and skin conductance, which have been shown to be effective
measures of cognitive and emotional responses. These tools measure how an individual’s
ideation process is affected by being exposed to priming.
The second goal of this dissertation is to design an EBS tool that primes an individual
with the subconscious goal of “achievement” concurrently as they work on a
brainstorming task. Previous studies that have used priming utilize it in an “a priori”
fashion. That is, they prime an individual before the task commences. The ability to
prime an individual in real-time as they complete a team task has not been explored in the
literature. This study aims to integrate priming into the EBS tool so that individuals can
be primed as they complete the EBS task (which I refer to as “concurrent” priming).
Research Questions
This dissertation addresses three research questions and designs an EBS tool that
enhances individual behavior through emotional and/or cognitive mechanisms, thereby
improving idea production during an EBS session. The first research question examines
the route through which a priori achievement priming affects idea generation
performance, specifically which emotional and/or cognitive responses are induced
3

through priming. For the second research question there are two parts. First, I develop a
new type of prime that is integrated into the EBS tool. The second part of the research
question addresses behavioral outcomes, mainly whether exposure to a concurrent,
achievement prime increases the fluency and quality of ideas produced. The concurrent
prime is expected to work through a similar cognitive and emotional route as the a priori
prime, yet its time course may be different. Thus, the second research question examines
whether concurrent priming acts through an emotional and/or cognitive route to enhance
idea generation performance. The third research question addresses whether the changes
in ideation induced through priming occur because the prime is achievement-oriented or
because the prime is positive in emotional valence and arousal. Therefore, the research
questions are:
RQ1: In a priori priming, does the prime affect idea generation performance through an
emotional and/or cognitive route during an EBS session?
RQ2a: Does concurrent priming of achievement increase the fluency and quality of ideas
produced during an EBS session?
RQ2b: In concurrent priming, does the prime affect idea generation performance through
an emotional and/or cognitive route during an EBS session?
RQ3: In concurrent priming, do the changes in ideation occur from the achievementoriented nature of the images or the positive valence and arousal of the images?
Dissertation Overview
This dissertation includes three studies. The first study has two primary goals.
First, it replicates findings of a priori, achievement priming and increased EBS fluency
and creativity found in Dennis et al. (2013). Second, and more importantly, it opens up
the “black box” of individual behavior, examining the precise emotional and cognitive
changes that occur following exposure to an a priori prime. These changes are
4

achievement priming-induced alterations in neurophysiology and psychophysiology that
affect the subsequent EBS session. The second study examines the effect of a newly
designed concurrent prime, integrated into the EBS tool, and its effect on both behavioral
(fluency/creativity), emotional (arousal/valence), and cognitive (attention/working
memory) outcomes. The third study examines whether the changes in ideation (i.e.,
behavior and cognitive/emotional) are created by concurrent priming being achievementoriented or by the prime being positive in both emotional valence and arousal.
Expected Contributions
The main contribution of this dissertation is to alter EBS design in shifting our
focus to designing systems that enhance individual cognition. Previous design of EBS
systems have focused on creating more efficient team processes and leveraging process
gains afforded by technology. This dissertation provides an argument for shifting this
logic to a new stage of EBS design, creating systems that reach better outcomes by
helping the individual reach their ideation maxima.
This dissertation also opens a new door in collaboration research, namely
designing collaboration tools that enhance individual cognition leading to improved team
performance. While the direct contribution of these studies provides a new set of design
principles for EBS systems, it is not limited to the EBS artifact. Findings of enhanced
performance in an EBS setting also provide fruitful areas of study for designing other
types of collaborative technology for the subconscious, such as video conferencing,
decision support systems, and social networking tools.
Another contribution is to the emergent NeuroIS literature. NeuroIS is an area of
information systems research, wherein neuroimaging techniques are used to elucidate IS
problems. In this context, the use of NeuroIS, and specifically EEG in this proposal,
5

provides an opportunity to examine information processing directly. The use of EEG to
understand neurophysiological changes in cognition and emotion has the potential to
uncover what happens in the brain during an EBS task after an individual has been
primed.
A final contribution of this dissertation provides a better understanding of the
emotional and cognitive underpinnings of priming-influenced ideation that help
researchers understand how priming influences individual cognition during an EBS
session. A further understanding of the mechanism through which priming influences
individual behavior enables more effective development of primes, strengthening our
ability to design systems for the subconscious. These contributions, taken together,
further the collaborative and NeuroIS research streams.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Overview of priming
Priming has been shown to change both our cognition and emotion (Bargh and
Chartrand 2000; Zajonc 1984). Priming is the activation of internal mental
representations in an attempt to influence subsequent behavior (Bargh and Chartrand
2000). Priming is traditionally implemented by giving a series of stimuli first (thus, “a
priori”), then measuring subsequent behavior on a task of interest. Once an individual’s
mental representations have been activated by the priming stimuli, subsequent behavior is
influenced. Priming has been shown to influence both cognition and emotion (Murphy
and Zajonc 1993). The depth of priming literature is expansive, with researchers using it
to influence everything from affecting purchase intentions (Yi 1990) to slowing a
participant’s walking speed (Bargh et al. 1996) to cultivating rude behavior (Shariff and
Norenzayan 2007) to sparking motivation to succeed on a task (Bargh et al. 2001).
6

Priming stimuli can take many forms, however, two common forms are with
pictures or words. There are many different ways individuals can be primed. However,
the three studies in this proposal use a form of semantic priming. Semantic priming is
designed to activate semantic networks within the brain and works by activating
associations closely related to a concept. Generally, this is done by using pictures or
words related to a concept (Carr et al. 1982). The brain is organized into networks based
on the associations one makes during prior experiences (Martin and Chao 2001).
Semantic networks develop as we begin to interact with the world and form a basis of
semantic memory that is interconnected with our previous associations of core objects,
concepts, or beliefs.
Priming research began with a study on creativity that described the tendency of
individuals to use prior notions of how objects should be used to complete tasks (Duncker
1945). These prior notions inhibited one’s creativity. However, when an individual
witnessed a novel use of an object immediately preceding a creativity task, he or she was
more likely to use a novel approach in completing his or her task (Duncker 1945).
Initially referred to as “perceptual readiness,” the term “priming” was later coined by
Segal and Cofer (1960) in reference to a phenomenon where participants exposed to
words in one task were more likely to use those words in subsequent tasks (Cofer 1967).
In later studies, the idea of priming was developed to describe the activation of mental
representations to influence future individual responses (Bargh and Chartrand 2000).
There are two predominant ways to deliver priming: subliminal (“below
threshold”) and supraliminal (“above threshold”). Subliminal priming involves brief
presentation of a stimulus, on the order of milliseconds, followed by a perceptual mask

7

(Bargh and Chartrand 2000). In this case, the stimulus is presented quickly and the
participant is not consciously aware of it. In contrast, with supraliminal priming, the
participant is consciously aware of the stimulus, but is not aware of its intent. The
common feature of both subliminal and supraliminal priming is that the participant is
unaware that the stimulus is activating mental representations (Bargh and Chartrand
2000). This dissertation focuses on supraliminal priming as prior research has shown
priming effects generated by supraliminal priming last for several minutes after the
priming session. A discussion of the duration of supraliminal priming effects is discussed
in later sections.
Priming and individual behavior
Priming research has shown that priming influences individual behavior through
emotional response and changes in cognition (Murphy and Zajonc 1993). Cognitive
processes such as categorization, recognition, and recall have all been shown to be
influenced by evoking mental representations of the constructs (Bargh 2002; Bargh and
Chartrand 2000). Once constructs become activated in the mind, its accessibility in
memory is heightened (Srull and Wyer 1980). Concepts and constructs that have become
accessible can subconsciously direct cognitive processes such as selective attention or
information retrieval from long-term memory (Yi 1990). Emotional (or affective)
response are typically viewed as a subjective experience that can be characterized by two
parameters: valence and arousal (Cacioppo et al. 2004). Cognitive response, on the other
hand, consists of specific mental processes, such as memory, attention, feature
identification, and categorization that involve estimates of sensory and perceptual
qualities (Murphy and Zajonc 1993).

8

In emotion, valence refers to the direction of behavioral activation associated with
an emotion. Valance describes a response to a stimulus that results in approach behavior
(i.e., appetitive/positive) or avoidance behavior (i.e., aversive/negative) (Lane et al.
1999). Valence was initially thought of as existing on a bipolar continuum, yet, more
recently, research has shown that positive and negative valence may exist on separate
continuums each ranging from “low” to “high” (Lang et al. 2005). The implication of the
“dual system” view of valence is that individuals can have varying levels of positive and
negative emotion occurring simultaneously. Researchers have found that both positive
and negative valence can be effectively measured by levels of activation and deactivation
of the corrugator supercilii muscle (Larsen et al. 2003). Arousal, on the other hand, is
believed to exist on a single continuum, which indicates how awake or reactive an
individual is to stimuli (Bolls et al. 2001; Lane et al. 1999). In sum, emotion is
conceptualized as having two dimensions: the valence (i.e., positive or negative) and
arousal (i.e., intensity) of the emotion.
Most priming research on emotions has focused on the effect of priming on
positive and negative emotional valence, rather than arousal (Zemack-Rugar et al. 2007).
Priming effects have been found exposing individuals to emotionally laden stimuli
(Chartrand et al. 2006). Repeated exposure to words with positive valence has been found
to create a positive emotional state, which in turn influences an individual’s subsequent
behavior (Chartrand et al. 2006). Similarly, repeated exposure to words with negative
valence creates a negative emotional state, also influencing the individual’s subsequent
behavior (Chartrand et al. 2006). In some emotional priming research, researchers have
been able to alter mood states in clinically depressed individuals, though the altered state

9

is transient and reverts back to baseline after a period of time (Fresco et al. 2006; Segal
and Ingram 1994).
This study will use semantic priming to better understand the route through which
achievement priming affects ideation performance. In semantic priming, the association
between words is more important in activating mental representations than the word itself
(Lucas 2000). For example, priming the word popcorn is likely to activate semantic
networks associated with eating and semantic networks associated with movies because
most people are aware that popcorn is popular in movie theaters. Thus if we prime the
word popcorn and then ask individuals to name celebrities, they would be more likely to
name movie stars than rock stars because the semantic network associated with movies is
active in working memory and the semantic network associated with music is not. As one
might expect, activation of semantic networks through priming is not permanent and
decays over time (Bargh and Chartrand 2000).
In a classic study not involving priming, participants read a series of behaviors
with instructions either to form an impression of the actor or to memorize the
information. The researchers found that the individuals that had been given the
impression-formation goal were able to recall more behaviors and had greater
organization of the material in memory than those given a goal only to memorize the
information (Hamilton et al. 1980). In an extension of this study using priming,
individuals were not given conscious instructions, but were primed with synonyms of
memorization (e.g., retain, hold) or evaluation (e.g., judge, evaluate). The findings were
identical with individuals given the impression-formation priming being able to recall
more behaviors with greater organization of the material in memory (Chartrand and

10

Bargh 1996). This research produced an important implication: the effect of priming an
individual resulted in the same behavior as giving the individual direct instructions.
It would be erroneous to assume that emotional or cognitive reactions to priming
are mutually exclusive, rather emotions and cognition often interact with both having
been shown to influence behavior (Zajonc 2000). In addition, research has shown that
defining primes as purely affective or purely cognitive oversimplifies the actual influence
of the prime (Zajonc 2000). In actuality, there is likely a change in emotion and a change
in cognition that results from most primes. Therefore, it is more reasonable to assume that
cognition and emotions are mutually related in priming.
More recently, priming research has focused on using primes to intentionally
influence human behavior. The key to developing a successful prime lies in optimizing its
ability to awaken mental representations or emotions related to the construct. A wide
array of constructs have been activated through this mechanism. In one of the most wellknown priming experiments, individuals played a scrambled sentence word game,
wherein there were words related to stereotypes of elderly people (e.g., Florida, old,
lonely, dependent) (Bargh et al. 1996). Once individuals had played this game, they were
thanked for their participation and left the experiment. Unbeknownst to them, there was a
confederate in the hallway outside the experimental room that timed their walk to the
elevator. The researchers found that individuals exposed to the “elderly” prime walked
more slowly than individuals exposed to a neutral prime designed to have no effect
(Bargh et al. 1996). The individuals primed with words related to our stereotypes of the
elderly took 15% longer to walk down the hallway than those not primed with the elderly
stereotype (Bargh et al. 1996).

11

In another experiment, individuals were exposed to words related to politeness
(e.g., respect, patiently, cordially, considerate) (Bargh et al. 1996). In a separate
treatment, individuals were primed with words related to rudeness (e.g., aggressively,
bold, rude, brazen) (Bargh et al. 1996). The participants played a scrambled sentence
word game. The participant was instructed to contact the experimenter upon completion
of the word game. When the participant finished the game, they opened the door to the
experiment room to find the experimenter in a discussion with a confederate posing as
another participant. Individuals primed with politeness interrupted the experimenter and
the confederate 18% of the time, whereas those primed with rudeness interrupted 64% of
the time. Individuals receiving a neutral prime designed to have no effect, interrupted
38% of the time, indicating that the politeness priming reduced the rate of interruptions
by 20% and the rudeness prime increased the rate of interruptions by 26% (Bargh et al.
1996).
To summarize, priming is the use of stimuli to activate internal mental
representations of a concept. It has been done in a variety of contexts, but typically
involves the use of an a priori priming session, followed by behavioral measurement.
Priming has been shown to be effective in evoking stereotypes, mindsets, emotions,
differing cognitive states, and behaviors. In addition, priming studies have traditionally
examined individual behavior as the outcome measures (Bargh and Chartrand 2000).
Only recently have studies begun to examine the effect of individual priming on team
interactions (Dennis et al. 2013; Postmes et al. 2001). More discussion of priming and
team behavior will be covered below.
Electronic brainstorming

12

Extensive research on brainstorming has been conducted over the last half century
(see, for review, Isaksen 1998). Since it was first described in 1954, brainstorming has
been utilized by organizations to generate alternatives for both simple and complex
problems (Isaksen 1998; Osborn 1954). A team’s primary objective in idea generation is
to produce creative ideas that can be further evaluated and implemented. One key
assertion made in Osborn (1954) is that groups of individuals can generate more ideas if
team members concentrate on producing whatever ideas occur to them, while
simultaneously avoiding evaluation of the ideas. Osborn further asserted that individuals
brainstorming in a group would generate more ideas than the same number of individuals
working separately, known as nominal group brainstorming (Osborn 1954). In
organizations, teams exist in a variety of different formations (e.g., formal versus
informal, large versus small), yet idea generation is a prevalent group activity in all
configurations (DeSanctis and Gallupe 1987).
Teams can engage in brainstorming in a variety of ways (e.g., verbal, electronic,
nominal). Verbal brainstorming has been used for more than a half century as a way to
improve individual brainstorming performance (Dennis and Valacich 1993). A verbal
brainstorming exercise should have four goals: (a) producing a large quantity of ideas, (b)
criticism must be ruled out, (c) freewheeling (wild/weird ideas) must be accepted and (d)
combination and improvisation on ideas should be encouraged (Osborn 1954).
There is an extensive body of literature on idea generation in virtual teams (see,
Dennis and Wixom 2002), establishing that virtual teams outperform face-to-face teams
in idea fluency and creativity (Briggs et al. 1997; Dennis and Valacich 1999). Idea
fluency is generally measured as the total number of unique ideas generated by a group.

13

Creativity of ideas can be conceptualized on different dimensions, such as novelty,
workability, relevance, and specificity (Dean et al. 2006). Goals of virtual teams can vary
with some teams requiring high idea fluency and other teams requiring only a few highly
creative ideas (Connolly et al. 1990).
Electronic brainstorming (EBS) involves the use of technology (e.g., e-mail,
browser based systems, text-based chat) to facilitate the brainstorming process (Gallupe
et al. 1992). It has been shown that the use of EBS results in better idea generation
performance than verbal interaction (Dennis and Wixom 2002). EBS captures the best
elements of verbal brainstorming by allowing group members to share and build on ideas
(Gallupe et al. 1991). EBS also minimizes the effect of production blocking and offers
increased anonymity, which have been shown to increase brainstorming performance
(Nunamaker et al. 1991). In addition, EBS systems allow individual team members to
scroll back through previously generated ideas at any point (Dennis and Valacich 1993).
More recently, EBS research is examining individual characteristics and cognition
as important factors influencing the success of EBS in group processes (Antunes and
Ferreira 2011; Kolfschoten 2011b). For example, EBS performance is affected by group
member characteristics such as domain knowledge, cognitive ability, personality type and
creative skill (Paulus and Yang 2000). Similarly, group performance has also been shown
to be influenced by the interface of the EBS tool (Shepherd et al. 1995). However, little
research has examined interface-design factors that can enhance individual cognition in
virtual teams.
Priming and team EBS
One key consideration in integrating the research on priming and EBS is
identifying the type of priming that will influence EBS performance. Many studies have
14

focused on influencing human behavior, with researchers finding that priming can
influence how individuals approach problems (Bargh et al. 1996; Bargh et al. 2001). In
one such experiment, researchers used a word search puzzle to prime the concept of
achievement (Bargh et al. 2001). In this study, individuals received either priming
semantically related to achievement (e.g., compete, win, succeed) or neutral words (e.g.,
ranch, carpet, shampoo). Individuals primed with achievement performed better in
subsequent tasks than individuals exposed to the neutral prime (Bargh et al. 2001). Bargh
et al. (2001) argues that achievement priming improves performance by activating
semantic networks related to achievement. These active networks motivate behavior by
creating a subconscious desire to achieve, thus influencing performance.
Individual motivation to perform a task is a function of the individual’s perception
of the importance of that task and the expectancy of success (Wigfield and Eccles 1994).
If one can positively influence either the perception of importance or expectancy of
success, motivation to perform the task should increase (Wigfield and Eccles 1994). I
argue that achievement priming works by activating the semantic networks associated
with success. I assert that when the semantic networks associated with success are
activated in memory by a priming stimulus, the individual subconsciously experiences an
increase in the expectancy of success for the subsequent task. This increase in the
expectancy of success causes motivation to increase, which in turn improves
performance.
In a study applying achievement priming to the EBS context, researchers found
that priming achievement increased idea fluency and creativity by approximately 30%
(Dennis et al. 2013). This study found that priming individuals improved performance of

15

the overall team, thus extending achievement priming to team behavior. The authors
specifically discuss how changes in individual cognition might be one route through
which ideation performance was effected (Dennis et al. 2013). Priming likely affects
subsequent performance by changing an individual’s motivation to perform the task.
NeuroIS
NeuroIS is an emergent sub-field of information systems that draws upon
neuroscience literature on cognition and emotion to inform IS research (Dimoka et al.
2011). There are a variety of NeuroIS tools (e.g., fMRI, EEG, NIRS), each having their
own strengths and weaknesses. These tools allow IS researchers to better examine the
underlying information processing that occurs as individuals interact with technology
(Dimoka et al. 2011). The use of cognitive neuroscience tools enables novel examination
of fundamental IS problems that surveys, lab experiments, and field studies are unable to
resolve. One such study, has the IS conceptualization of “trust,” indicating that trust and
distrust are fundamentally different concepts, residing in different areas of the brain
(Dimoka 2010). The research agenda of NeuroIS includes localizing neural correlates of
IS constructs, capturing mental processes, and complementing existing sources of IS date
with brain data (Dimoka et al. 2011).
The physiological effects of priming on emotion and cognition have been well
documented in the literature, though most studies utilize subliminal priming and
relatively small time windows (see, for example, Arndt et al. 2001; Bernat et al. 2001).
In one study, individuals were exposed to positive and negative words and EEG and
facial EMG were used to examine the responses. The study found changes in facial EMG
and EEG that coincided with the valence of the word that had been shown (e.g., positive
changes in affect were observed following positive words) (Bernat et al. 2001). These
16

findings provide support for priming working through an emotional route. Similarly,
priming has shown to induce changes in cognition (Holcomb and Neville 1990). In one
study, changes were observed in EEG measurement of the N400, a neurophysiological
response that is closely tied to attention and cognitive load, after exposure to a semantic
prime (Holcomb and Neville 1990).
In this dissertation, I use three tools to examine changes in cognition (specifically
working memory and attention) and emotion induced by priming during an EBS session.
For changes in emotion, I use a combination of psychophysiological and
neurophysiological measurements. Psychophysiological measurements have been found
to be useful in both the measurement of emotional valence and arousal (Bolls et al. 2001).
Specifically, for changes in valence, I use facial EMG, while changes in arousal will be
measured by skin conductance. Changes in cognition will be measured using EEG, a
neurophysiological tool.
STUDY ONE: A PRIORI PRIMING
Introduction to a priori priming
The first study within this dissertation focuses on discovering the cognitive and
emotional changes induced by “a priori” priming. “A priori” priming is priming
delivered before a task to influence behavior on that task. Previous research has
established that “a priori” achievement-oriented priming influences the fluency and
creativity of ideas generated in subsequent EBS sessions (Dennis et al. 2013; Postmes et
al. 2001). However, these studies do not examine the cognitive and emotional
underpinnings in the individual that drive the changes in ideation fluency and creativity.
This study addresses the first research question, which examines whether a priori priming

17

affects ideation performance through an emotional and/or cognitive route during an EBS
session. Formally stated,
RQ1: In a priori priming, does the prime affect idea generation performance
through an emotional and/or cognitive route during an EBS session?
Theory and hypotheses
In Dennis et al. (2013) the authors did not discuss potential changes in emotion,
induced by priming that might also influence ideation performance. The achievement
priming condition of their study likely influences individual (and thus team) performance
through two routes: emotion and cognition. The priming words utilized in their study
were achievement-related and, therefore, were expected to activate semantic networks
related to achievement (i.e., influence cognition). Similarly, the priming words were also
positive in valence and high in arousal. Since the individuals were exposed to words of
positive valence and high arousal repeatedly,Chartrand et al. (2006) would predict the
words to have an effect on the participant’s emotions as well.
The authors further theorized that increased individual idea production is likely to
have a direct effect on the group output and performance. This study showed that
increases in idea fluency and creativity were as large as using the EBS technology itself
(Dennis et al. 2013). The first study of this dissertation will attempt to replicate this
finding and extend it to examine the cognitive underpinnings of the expected effect.
The first hypotheses in this study seek to replicate these findings, while the
hypotheses in later sections focus on the specific emotional and cognitive changes
induced by achievement priming. Therefore, achievement priming is hypothesized to
increase the idea fluency during a subsequent EBS task. Thus,
Hypothesis 1a: A priori priming of the concept “achievement” will increase idea
fluency during an EBS session.
18

In addition to increasing the overall fluency of ideas, the semantic prime is
expected to increase the creativity of the ideas through the same theoretical mechanism as
increasing idea fluency. In Dean et al. (2006), idea creativity is conceptualized as a multidimensional construct, consisting of four dimensions. These four dimensions are novelty,
workability, relevance, and specificity (Dean et al. 2006). Idea creativity is generally
conceptualized as a count of the number of “highly creative” ideas or a total creativity
score across all ideas. In Dennis et al. (2013), priming was found to increase the overall
creativity of ideas generated in an EBS session. In this study, a priori, achievement
priming is expected to increase the creativity of ideas generated during an EBS task.
Thus,
Hypothesis 1b: A priori priming of the concept “achievement” will increase idea
creativity during an EBS session.
3.2.1. A priori priming and time
Priming effects are transient in nature and decay after a period of time (Bargh and
Chartrand 2000; DeCoster and Claypool 2004). As time elapses after the priming stimuli,
cognitive changes become less pronounced, resulting in dissipation of the priming effect
(DeCoster and Claypool 2004). In fact, a priming effect decay function has been
described in the literature (Higgins et al. 1985). This study found that there is a fixed,
maximal level of activation that is reached during the priming manipulation, which
slowly dissipates after the prime is removed (Higgins et al. 1985). There has been some
debate in the literature over whether priming effects decay at a linear or exponential rate.
The notion is that, after exposure to a prime, the effect on cognition dissipates at a given
rate determined by a host of factors like frequency or intensity of the prime (Higgins et
al. 1985). As a priming effect decays, the networks representing the primed construct
19

become less activated and eventually the behavior is no longer influenced (Higgins et al.
1985).
This study examines the effect of priming over time in addition to examining the
overall effect outlined in Section 2.4. While the overall effect outlined in Section 2.4 is a
replication of prior work, Dennis et al. (2013) did not examine idea generation over time
during the EBS session. Examination of the time course of idea generation will help
elucidate when the a priori priming effect exerts its greatest influence. Since a priori
priming is known to decay, it is likely that the greatest productivity gains occur during
the initial stages of an EBS session immediately following the prime. As a result, I
hypothesize that the performance differences in achievement priming (as compared to
neutral priming) will be the strongest in the first half of the EBS task. There is some
debate in the literature whether the decay function in a priori priming results in either a
linear or exponential rate of decay (DeCoster and Claypool 2004; Higgins et al. 1985).
Regardless, of the slope of the decay function, performance on latter stages of the task
will be influenced by priming effect decay. Therefore, performance on the late stages of
the task will result in idea generation that is no different than neutral priming. Thus,
Hypothesis 2a: A priori priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
greater idea fluency than neutral priming during the first half of an EBS session.
Hypothesis 2b: A priori priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in no
different idea fluency than neutral priming during the last half of an EBS session.
Idea creativity has also been shown to be influenced by achievement priming
(Dennis et al. 2013). It is expected that after exposure to an a priori prime, creativity
during an EBS session will also decrease as the time unfolds. During the beginning of the
task, creativity will likely be different between the achievement and neutral priming
conditions, whereas, in the latter parts of the task, priming is likely to become similar
20

between the achievement and neutral priming conditions as the priming effect decays.
Therefore, I hypothesize:
Hypothesis 3a: A priori priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
greater idea creativity than neutral priming during the first half of an EBS
session.
Hypothesis 3b: A priori priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in no
different idea creativity than neutral priming during the last half of an EBS
session.
3.2.2. Psychophysiological correlates of cognition
Cognitive changes were measured using EEG. EEG is a neurophysiological
measurement of post-synaptic electrical potentials on the surface of the scalp (Gibbs and
Gibbs 1941). Electrodes are placed on specific locations on the scalp and collect the
summation of synchronized activity from underlying pyramidal neurons lying near the
surface of cortex. The measure at each electrode location is then compared to a reference
electrode located elsewhere on the scalp (Harmon-Jones and Peterson 2009). The
recorded oscillations of brain activity at each electrode are complex waveforms that can
be decomposed into simple waveforms of different periodicity at varying amplitudes.
EEG researchers often are interested in five frequency bands: delta (< 4 Hz), theta (48Hz), alpha (8-13Hz), beta (13-20Hz), and gamma (>20) (Harmon-Jones and Peterson
2009).
I will focus on the alpha band because of the inverse relationship between alpha
frequency amplitude and attention, wherein lower levels of alpha represent higher levels
of attention. When the brain is at rest, alpha rhythms result from the synchronization of
underlying neural activity, which is indicative of an “idling” process. When the brain is
active, desynchronization of these neurons occurs, resulting in decreases in alpha
frequency detected at the scalp which is referred to as “alpha blocking” (Andreassi 2007;
21

Potter and Bolls 2011). Better performance has been found as a result of increased
activity (measured as alpha blocking) (Hoptman and Davidson 1998).
When developing hypotheses for this study, it was first necessary to deconstruct
the cognitive processes associated with the study task—text-based team brainstorming—
in order to identify regions where alpha blocking would be expected. Information will be
presented visually during the discussion via text displayed on a computer screen. Thus, if
an individual observes and pays attention to incoming textual information, decreases in
alpha could be expected in the occipital region of the brain, known to pertain to initial
processing of visual stimuli (Beaumont 1983). In the occipital lobe initial, high-level
categorization of the information occurs (i.e., “this is a word” vs. “this is a face”)
(Beaumont 1983). After this, language-related information is relayed to language
processing brain regions such as Wernicke’s and Broca’s areas for further assessment
(Gevins and Smith 2000; Watkins and Paus 2004).
Working memory plays a central role in cognition (Baddeley 1992). It
encapsulates both what many consider “short-term memory” and attention. Therefore,
working memory is pivotal for both information processing and brainstorming,
responsible for encoding information from the environment and retrieving information
from long-term memory in order to make sense of it (Baddeley 1992; Conway and Engle
1994; Welsh et al. 1999). A useful computer analogy for understanding working memory
is that it represents the brain’s RAM, storing of information currently undergoing
processing but limited in its capacity (D'Esposito 2007). Working memory is most
heavily associated with the frontal areas of cortex, namely Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex
(DLPFC) (D'Esposito et al. 1995). However, it is important to note that neural networks

22

distribute working memory to multiple areas of cortex. Changes in activity in the DLPFC
indicate changes in working memory load and attention (Wager et al. 2004). In EEG,
attenuation of the alpha rhythm over DLPFC indicates increases in working memory load
(Gevins et al. 1997). Cognitive load in working memory (in the frontal and temporal
regions of the brain) is reduced when irrelevant information is presented, as less
information needs to be maintained for subsequent recall (Lavie 2005).
In this study, use an a priori prime. The prime is expected to have a similar effect
on cognition measured as greater alpha attenuation in the frontal cortices after exposure
to the achievement-oriented prime. Given the close relationship between frontal alphawave activity and attention, I hypothesize:
Hypothesis 4: A priori priming of the concept of achievement, as compared to a
neutral prime, will increase attention during ideation in an EBS session.
3.2.3. Psychophysiological correlates of emotion
As discussed in Section 2.2, emotion has two distinct components: valence (i.e.,
direction) and arousal (i.e., intensity) (Cacioppo et al. 2004). Both positive and negative
valence can be measured using facial EMG. The electrical signals generated by the facial
muscles can be measured by placing electrodes over the specific muscle groups. The
most common muscle groups measured for emotional valence are the corrugator
supercilli muscle (Bolls et al. 2001). The corrugator muscle, often called the “frown”
muscle, is located above the brow off the bridge of the nose. When the corrugator
contracts, the muscle moves the brow downward and inward (Fridlund and Izard 1983).
The use of the corrugator supercilli muscle in the measurement of valence was
validated using both pictures (Lang et al. 1993) and words (Wexler et al. 1992). When
participants were exposed to negative pictures or words, the corrugator muscle contracted
23

(Lang et al. 1993; Wexler et al. 1992). These findings have been shown to be robust even
when more complex stimuli are used, such as radio advertisements (Bolls et al. 2001),
television programs (Potter et al. 2006), and video games (Ravaja et al. 2008). More
recently, the corrugator supercilli muscle has been shown to deactivate when an
individual experiences positive valence (van den Hoogen et al. 2012; van Reekum et al.
2011).
In most priming experiments, the valence of the words differs between priming
manipulations (Bargh 2002; Bargh and Chartrand 2000). In the context of achievement
priming, words surrounding achievement generally have high positive valence. Repeated
exposure to positive words has shown to increase positive valence, while repeated
exposure to negative words has been shown to increase negative valence (Bradley and
Lang 1994; Kensinger and Schacter 2006). Therefore, I expect achievement priming to
result in increased positive valence. Increased positive valence can be measured by the
corrugator supercilli muscle becoming relatively more deactivated following exposure to
the prime. Therefore,
Hypothesis 5a: A priori priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in a
physiological response that indicates more positive valence than neutral priming
during ideation in an EBS session.
Emotional arousal will be measured using electrodermal activity (EDA),
specifically skin conductance will be measured off the plantar surface of the foot.
Increases in sympathetic nervous system activation result in increased skin conductance
(Lykken and Venables 1971). Dense populations of sweat glands are located in the hand
and foot. These locations are considered the optimal locations to obtain EDA (Lykken
and Venables 1971).

24

Semantic priming often uses stimuli that also have high arousal. For example, in
Dennis et al. (2013), the words in the achievement priming condition had significantly
higher arousal than the neutral priming condition. Repeated exposure to words that have
been rated as high in arousal has been shown to increase an individual’s arousal (Bradley
and Lang 1994; Kensinger and Schacter 2006). In one study, emotional words high in
arousal were shown to amplify the priming effects resulting from repeated exposure to
the words (Thomas and LaBar 2005). These highly-arousing words were shown to
increase an individual’s arousal independently from the valence attributes of the word
(Thomas and LaBar 2005). The mechanism through which increased arousal occurs is
related to autonomic nervous system activation, specifically increases in sympathetic
nervous system activation (Bradley et al. 2008). The result of this increased activation
manifests in increased skin conductance, pupil size, and heart rate (Bradley et al. 2008).
Exposure to an achievement prime is expected to increase sympathetic nervous system
activation (i.e., increased arousal), resulting in increased skin conductance in subsequent
ideation during an EBS session. Therefore,
Hypothesis 5b: A priori priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in a
physiological response that indicates increased arousal than neutral priming
during ideation in an EBS session.
3.2.4. Changes in cognition and emotion over time
As discussed in Section 2.5, priming effects decay over time. Since priming
effects decay over time, the physiological changes occurring in the body will diminish
over time as well. Due to the transient nature of the priming effect, it is expected that any
changes in emotion or cognition will be most apparent in the beginning stages of the task
and will return to baseline in the latter stages of the task. For emotion, changes in valence
and arousal will be apparent early on the task, and return to baseline as the priming effect
25

decays. A similar result is expected in cognition, most changes in cognition will occur in
the beginning of the task with a gradual return to baseline as the task unfolds. Therefore, I
hypothesize:
Hypothesis 6a: A priori priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
more positive valence during ideation in the first half of an EBS session when
compared to neutral priming.
Hypothesis 6b: A priori priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in no
different positive valence during ideation in the last half of an EBS session when
compared to neutral priming.
Hypothesis 7a: A priori priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
increased arousal during ideation in the first half of an EBS session when
compared to neutral priming.
Hypothesis 7b: A priori priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in no
different arousal during ideation in the last half of an EBS session when
compared to neutral priming.
Hypothesis 8a: A priori priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
greater attention, as measured by alpha attenuation in the frontal cortices, during
ideation in the first half of an EBS session when compared to neutral priming.
Hypothesis 8b: A priori priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
similar attention, as measured by alpha attenuation in the frontal cortices, during
ideation in the last half of an EBS session when compared to neutral priming.
Study One: A Priori Priming Methodology
3.3.1. Participants
Sixty students were recruited from an introductory business course at a large, state
university. The course consisted of sophomores and juniors, and participants received
extra credit for completing the study. Information on an individual’s age, gender, and
grade level was collected via demographic questionnaire. Demographic variables were
obtained to provide average age and gender distribution. Age ranged from 19 to 25. The
average age of the participants was 19.53. Thirty-three participants (55%) were male and
27 participants were female (45%). Fifty participants reported being right handed, 8
26

reported being left handed, and 2 reported being ambidextrous.
3.3.2. Tasks
This study used two 12-minute electronic brainstorming (EBS) tasks based on
prior literature (Dennis et al. 2013; Dennis and Valacich 1994). One task was generating
ideas to increase tourism within a state and the other task was generating ideas on
reducing pollution. The participants were instructed to generate as many ideas as
possible, building off of the ideas of others in the “team.”
However, participants did not actually interact with other team members; rather
they were deceived into believing they were working with a team. They used a team
simulator that played a 12-minute prepared script. The script was derived from a real
five-member, 15-minute EBS discussion. The script was utilized to provide experimental
control, creating consistency between the individuals in the EEG study. Simulators have
been utilized in many prior studies in both EBS and decision-making tasks (Garfield et al.
2001; Heninger et al. 2006). They have been shown to be useful for researchers studying
individual behavior in team interactions by controlling for the variance in interactions
between different teams (Heninger et al. 2006).
In a similar manner to text-based discussion tools, the simulator provided two
onscreen windows. The top window contained the comments from other “team members”
and the comments submitted by the participant to the group, while the bottom window
provided space for participants to type their ideas. Once the participant hit the “enter” key
or clicked “submit,” their idea moved to the top window and was displayed to the rest of
the team. A scroll bar appeared on the right of the top window, and the text will move up
as new ideas were generated (either from the simulated group or the participant). The
participant were told that other team members were located across campus.
27

3.3.3. Treatments
This study was a repeated measures experiment using a priori priming with
pictures. Each participant received two within subject treatments: achievement priming
and neutral priming. The within subject treatments were fully counterbalanced to control
for task or priming order effects. The participants viewed a picture for 10 seconds then
answered follow-up questions on how positive and negative the picture made them feel as
well as how aroused the picture made them feel. In each priming condition, the
participant viewed and rated 20 images. Priming research has shown that priming
someone with a concept for five minutes leads to a priming effect of approximately ten
minutes (Bargh and Chartrand 2000), and past research has shown no carry-over effects
of priming from one treatment to another in repeated measures studies (Dennis et al.
2013).
The achievement priming treatment will be designed to prime the concept of
“achievement,” while the neutral priming treatment will be designed to have no effect. In
the achievement priming treatment, pictures were chosen to relate to the concept of
“achievement”. The achievement priming condition for the a priori priming consisted of a
set of 20 images oriented towards the concept of “achievement,” while the neutral
priming condition consists of 25 images designed to have no effect. Five placebo images
were included in the achievement priming condition to ensure some variance in
emotional arousal and valence of the images. The images for the achievement and neutral
priming conditions were rated by a group of students on achievement, arousal, and
valence. Examples of the achievement and neutral images are provided in Appendix C of
this document. The achievement-oriented images significantly differed from neutral
images on achievement rating by students (t(58) =7.87, p < .001) (for a full summary of
28

results see Appendix A). Arousal was rated on a scale from 1 (low arousal) to 9 (high
arousal), and valence is rated from 1 (negative) and 9 (positive). The neutral images were
moderate in arousal (M = 4.64, S.D. = 0.39) and moderate in valence (M = 5.32, S.D. =
0.49). The achievement priming images had higher arousal (M = 5.14, S.D. = 0.41) and
more positive valence (M = 5.47, S.D. = 0.61). The achievement priming images
significantly differed from the neutral priming words on both arousal (t(58) = 4.41, p <
.001) and valence (t(58) = 3.75, p < .001).
3.3.4. Dependent Variables
The dependent variables of this study consisted of both behavioral measures and
physiological measures.
3.3.4.1. Behavioral Measures
The primary behavioral dependent measure is idea generation performance. Idea
generation performance can be conceptualized in a variety of ways. In this study,
performance is conceptualized in two ways: number of unique ideas generated and the
creativity of ideas generated. Two raters independently analyzed the ideas generated from
a subset of 20% of the total participants. The two raters independently identified the
number of unique ideas in the transcript. The raters then came together and identify the
number of concordant ideas (i.e., ideas agreed upon by both raters as being unique ideas
for that transcript). Inter-rater reliability was established by counting the number of ideas
the raters agreed upon across 20% of the chat transcripts and dividing by the total number
of ideas identified as “potential unique ideas” by the raters (i.e., calculated by (1-(number
of agreements between coders / total codings). Inter-rater reliability for number of unique
ideas generated was 95.2%.

29

The second behavioral measure was idea creativity. A master idea list was
generated from all ideas mentioned by the participants. After the master idea list had been
created, the creativity of each idea will be assessed. While there are many ways to
conceptualize creativity, this study employed the approach outlined by Dean et al. (2006).
Dean et al. (2006) conceptualizes creativity as a multi-dimensional construct, consisting
of 4 unique dimensions: novelty, workability, relevance, and specificity. Three of the
dimensions are used in this study. The specificity dimension was omitted because the use
of a master idea list (a generalized list of similar ideas across groups) removed unique
wording used by the participant, and it is the unique wording of the idea that is used to
assess the specificity of the idea.
Each of the dimensions of creativity consists of two sub-dimensions. Novelty is
comprised of originality and paradigm relatedness. High originality indicates the idea is
both rare and ingenious or imaginative (Dean et al. 2006). Each idea was ranked on a
scale from 1 (not original) to 4 (very original). Paradigm relatedness was the degree to
which an idea relates to the currently prevailing paradigm and indicates the idea has the
ability to be transformational and germinal to solving the problem at hand (Dean et al.
2006). For example, in a brainstorming task involving increasing tourism in Arizona, an
idea highly unrelated to current paradigms would be: “advertising Arizona as having
ocean front property after California falls into the ocean.” Paradigm relatedness is scored
on a scale of 1 (paradigm preserving) to 4 (paradigm breaking).
For the workability dimension of creativity the two sub-dimensions are
implementability and acceptability. Acceptability was measured by determining the
degree to which an idea can be successfully adopted by a society or organization (Dean et

30

al. 2006). Acceptability was scored on a scale of 1 (not acceptable) to 4 (acceptable,
violates no societal/organizational norms). The second sub-dimension of workability was
implementability. Implementability describes how easily an idea can be realized (Dean et
al. 2006). It was scored on a scale from 1 (totally infeasible) to 4 (easy to implement at
low cost).
The final dimension of creativity that was measured in this study is relevance,
which consists of the sub-dimensions applicability and effectiveness. Applicability
describes how well the idea relates to the stated problem (Dean et al. 2006). It was
measured on a scale from 1 (does not produce a useful outcome) to 4 (solves the
identified problem that is directly related). The second sub-dimension of relevance was
effectiveness or the degree to which the idea will solve the problem. It was measured on a
scale from 1 (solves an unrelated problem, would not work on current problem even if
you could do it) to 4 (reasonable and will solve the stated problem without regard for
workability).
There are several ways of calculating creativity (e.g., calculating a total creativity
score, counting the number of good ideas, etc.) (Reinig et al. 2007). In this study, I
measure creativity as a count of the number of ideas rated as highly creative (Reinig et al.
2007). To obtain the ideas high in creativity, only the ideas coded as 3 or above will be
counted on each dimension. Then the total number of highly creative ideas will be
generated for each participant based on novelty, workability, and relevance dimensions.
Each participant will receive a separate novelty, workability, and relevance score. Two
raters rated 20% of the ideas generated on each of the six dimensions used in the study.
Inter-rater reliability was calculated as (1-(number of agreements between coders / total

31

codings. Inter-rater reliability was established at 89.6% for the ratings of idea quality
with no sub-dimension having less than 87% reliability on the quality ratings by the two
raters.
3.3.4.2. Physiological Measures
There are three physiological measures utilized in this study: cortical attention,
autonomic arousal, and emotional valence. These were operationalized using
neurological and psychophysiological measures. The primary physiological measure in
this study was cortical attention, operationalized using neurophysiological measures (i.e.,
EEG alpha wave). EEG measures were collected using a 14-channel headset (Emotiv
Systems, San Francisco, CA, USA) with electrodes dispersed over the scalp along the 1020 system (Herwig et al. 2003) (see Figure 1). The Emotiv system is a low-density
electrode EEG device that has been shown to collect a veracious signal of underlying
cortical activity. The signal obtained has been shown to be as good as larger high-density
systems. Even though it is a low-density system, research has shown the Emotiv system
detects neurophysiological signals equivalent to high-density, expansive EEG arrays
(Badcock et al. 2013).
EEG, as a neurophysiological technique, is the measurement of the electrical signals
present at the surface of the scalp. An EEG system is capable of measuring the relatively
small electrical signals produced in the superficial areas of the underlying cortices. EEG
is widely regarded as having the highest temporal resolution of all the neuroimaging
techniques, capable of accurately measuring electrical signals on the order of
milliseconds. Over time, these electrical signals form complex wave patterns or
oscillations. Different oscillations have been shown to be related to various aspects of
cognition. For example, the alpha wave, an oscillation with a frequency of 8-13Hz, has
32

been shown to be closely related to attention (Başar et al. 2001). Higher levels of alpha
activity on the scalp relates to lower levels of attention. The alpha wave has also been
shown to be location-specific with the presence of alpha waves in various locations of
cortex being related to different cognitive processes. For example, alpha waves over left
frontal cortex are related to cognitive load, working memory, and attention, while alpha
waves over the occipital lobe being closely related to visual attention (Başar et al. 2001).
The EEG device consists of electrodes, which connect with the scalp surface via felt
pads saturated with saline solution. Generally, EEG devices measure electrical activity in
relation to the deviance from another pair of sensors on the scalp. For the Emotiv device,
the reference electrodes are located at P3 and P4 over the inferior, posterior parietal
lobule (Herwig et al. 2003). All other channels will be measured in relation to the
electrical activity present at these locations, sampled at 128Hz. Impedances will be
verified and data will be collected using Emotiv TestBench Software Version 1.5.0.3,
which can export data into comma-delimited format for subsequent analysis in Matlab. A
detailed overview of the EEG data cleansing and analysis process is provided in
Appendix B.
Second, skin conductance was used as a measure of autonomic arousal in the
participant, operationalized as skin conductance level measured between two electrodes
on the surface of the skin. Skin conductance has been used in experimental research for
decades and has been shown to be related to a variety of concepts related to arousal
(Lykken and Venables 1971). Increases in skin conductance indicate increased autonomic
arousal and further indicate the level of attention or excitation of the participant (Lykken
and Venables 1971). Generally, skin conductance has a time-lag of 3 to 4 seconds from

33

stimulus onset. Therefore, changes in skin conductance in this study were measured
during the time window of 2 to 6 seconds after an ideation process has started (e.g., 3 to 6
seconds after the first keystroke that is followed by the participant submitting an idea to
the group). Skin conductance was measured with 8mm bipolar AG/AGCL electrodes that
were filled with electrically neutral gel and adhered to the planar surface of foot after
lightly hydrating it with distilled water. A Coulbourn Instruments (Whitehall, PA, USA)
skin conductance coupler delivered .5V to the planar surface and conductance will be
sampled by a Coulbourn AD/DA board at 125Hz using VPM software version 12.8
(Cook 2010).
Third, emotional valence was operationalized as the relative activation of the
corrugator supercilli muscle group. Corrugator and zygote EMG were measured using a
pair of mini (4mm) reusable AG/AGCL electrodes filled with electrolyte gel placed
above the subject’s left eye after dead skin cells had been removed by a skin prep pad
containing rubbing alcohol and pumice. The bipolar corrugator measures was collected
using a Coulbourn bioamplifier with high pass filters set at 8Hz. The full wave signal is
rectified and then contour integrated online at a time constant of 100ms prior to sampling.
3.3.5. Procedure
Participants completed the experimental procedure individually after providing
informed consent approved by the university’s Institutional Review Board. The
experiment took place in an individual lab room at a research institute. The entire
research session lasted approximately 90 minutes. The surveys presented in the
experiment were controlled by MediaLab software (Jarvis 2010). The simulator was be
presented using MatLab software.
Participants were seated in a high back chair to minimize movement. They used a
34

standard keyboard and mouse. The protocol began with a 10-minute series of handedness
and demographic questionnaires. The experimenter then explained the procedure for
attaching the physiological electrodes and fitting the EEG apparatus, answering any
questions posed by the participant. Readings for the EMG and EEG measures to assure
appropriate levels of impendence.
Participants were be instructed to view the pictures and rate how the pictures
made them feel; all participants in the same group received the same priming treatments,
either achievement or neutral. In addition, task order and treatment order were fully
counterbalanced and participants were randomly assigned to one of the task/priming
treatment orders. Participants then worked on the first EBS task for twelve minutes. Next
they completed a short personality survey to serve as a “distractor” between treatments.
Participants repeated these same steps (priming game, idea generation) for the second
priming manipulation and task. The participants were then debriefed and the session
concluded.
In total, the EEG apparatus was only on the participants for approximately 45
minutes, during which the electrodes remained damp with the saline solution. Impedance
values for each cranial location remained acceptable for the duration of the experiment.
Markers were inserted into the data by the simulation software, indicating when the
subject entered an idea into the chat simulator. This allowed for synchronization between
the EBS session, EEG and EMG systems. When the discussion simulation completed, the
experimenter removed all physiological data collection sensors. Participants then
completed the post-experiment questionnaire. Finally, they were debriefed, told of the
deception, asked not to inform others of the deception, and thanked for their time.

35

3.3.6. Manipulation Checks
It was essential to ensure that participants perceived the simulator as a real team
discussion. All participants completed post-session questionnaires that asked if they had
noticed anything unusual about the team discussion. A variety of distractor questions
(e.g., satisfaction with discussion, perceived effectiveness) were also included to better
ensure that manipulation check question did not stand out. Participants that recognize
they were not interacting with real people were removed from the study as failing the
manipulation check. Seven of the 60 participants recognized they were interacting with a
simulator and were removed from the analysis, leaving 53 participants in the study. This
represents a 11.7% of individuals failing the manipulation check, which is in line with
prior studies ranging to 10-15% of the subjects failing manipulation checks (Garfield et
al. 2001; Heninger et al. 2006).
3.3.7. Data Analysis
3.3.7.1. EEG Data Cleaning and Preparation
EEG data were cleaned and analyzed using EEGLab Version 13.0.0.0 (Delorme
and Makeig 2004). One limitation of EEG is that cortical bioelectrical activity is
extremely small in magnitude when compared to muscle movements across the head.
Therefore, participant movement introduces artifacts of high-frequency and magnitude
into the EEG data. The most notorious of these is the ocular or “eye motion” artifact.
These were removed using two methods: EEGLab probability calculations and visual
inspection. The EEGLab artifact rejection algorithm uses deviations in microvolts greater
than three standard deviations from the mean to reject specific trials. However, additional
artifacts are also apparent to the trained eye, so visual inspection of trials is essential in
artifact removal (Delorme and Makeig 2004). The number of trials varied based on the
36

number of ideas generated by each individual in each EBS session. Using published
guidelines (Delorme and Makeig) we rejected approximately 20% of the trials based on
muscular artifacts.
In addition to trial-by-trial removal of artifacts, occasionally specific EEG
channels must be rejected in an individual subject’s data due to unacceptable impedance
levels. This was done in the current study using an automatic impedance detection feature
of EEGLab. Single channels were detected and removed from 1 participants prior to
analysis. No subject had more than one channel rejected.
3.3.7.2. ICA Decomposition of EEG data
The first step of the EEG analysis was an Independent Components Analysis
(ICA) at the individual level. A common problem in neuroimaging research results from
the collection of large amounts of data which, based upon the Central Limit Theorem,
become normally distributed. However, the brain is comprised of discrete patches of
cortex that are very active at some points in time and relatively non-active at others (i.e.,
activity is not normally distributed across the scalp) (Onton and Makeig 2006). ICA
overcomes this problem by taking this Gaussian data and rotating it until it becomes nonGaussian, thereby isolating independent components contributing to the activitation.
Initially, an EEGLab ICA performs a Principal Components Analysis (PCA). At
each electrode site the program assesses which of the other electrode sites account for the
most variance in the signal. Taking these weighted values it then relaxes the
orthogonality constraint of PCA to isolate individual components of activation (Onton
and Makeig 2006). Each ICA component then represents a pattern of activation over the
entire brain, not solely the activity present at a specific electrode. The number of
independent components (ICs) depends on the number of electrodes in the dataset, as the
37

algorithm is working in an N-dimensional space (where N is the number of electrodes).
Most participants in the current study generated 14 distinct ICs, since our recording
device had 14 electrodes. The participant with a single electrode removed from analysis
due to poor impedance produced 13 ICs.
Finally, using the K-means component of EEGlab the independent components at
the individual level were grouped into clusters of similar components generated between
subjects. This was done using recommended procedures that clustered similar ICs
according to their latency, frequency, amplitude, and scalp distribution (Delorme and
Makeig). Eight clusters were generated and evaluated for the final analysis.
EEG measurement provides a plethora of data that can be decomposed using
different analytical procedures. I chose to use Event Related Spectral Perturbation
(ERSP) for its ability to model both time and frequency changes occurring in the ICs over
the time window specified. Time-frequency analysis is especially appropriate for lowdensity EEG systems. The ERSP produces a latency-by-frequency image that shows
mean changes in log power from some pre-specified baseline mean value (Makeig 1993).
In this experiment we used the 1000ms after an idea had been generated as our baseline
mean. I generated ERSPs that were during the ideation process (i.e., immediately before
the subject entered an idea in the chat simulator). Therefore, the ERSPs were from
4000ms to 2000ms before the subject entered an idea into the chat simulator.
I generated ERSPs that included the alpha band frequency (8-13Hz), which is
closely tied to attention and cognitive load (Klimesch et al. 1993; Onton et al. 2005).
Decreases in log power over the latency window indicate increased attention during that
timeframe. EEGLab provides statistical comparisons of ERSPs.

Study One: A Priori Priming Results
3.4.1. Behavioral results
The statistical analyses for the behavioral component of study one were
completed in SPSS PASW Statistics 18.0. A repeated-measures GLM was used to
examine differences between the achievement and neutral priming conditions.
3.4.1.1. Idea fluency
Individuals produced significantly more ideas with achievement priming pictures
than the neutral priming pictures (F(1,50) = 8.05, p = .007). The effect size was small
with a Cohen’s d of 0.28. The order in which the group received priming treatments did
not affect the number of unique ideas generated (F(1,50) = 3.55, p = .065), nor did the
task order for the pollution and tourism task (F(1,50) = 0.15, p = .705). Therefore,
Hypothesis 1a was supported.
3.4.1.2. Idea Creativity
Individuals produced a greater number of novelty ideas following the a priori
achievement priming treatment than the neutral (F(1,50) = 9.80, p = .003). The effect size
was medium with Cohen’s d = .403. The order in which the participant received the
priming conditions did not affect the number of novel ideas produced (F(1,50) = .04, p =
.837), nor did the order in which he or she received the pollution or tourism task (F(1,50)
= .29, p = .596).
Individuals produced a greater number of workable ideas following the a priori
achievement prime than the neutral prime (F(1,50) = 6.72, p = .012). The effect size was
small with a Cohen’s d = .278. The order in which the participant received the priming
conditions did not affect the number of workable ideas produced (F(1,50) = 1.10, p =
.300), nor did task order (F(1,50) = .40, p = .529).
39

Individuals produced a greater number of relevant ideas following the a priori
achievement prime than the neutral priming game (F(1,50) = 12.36, p = .001). The effect
size was medium with Cohen’s d = .400. The order in which the participant received the
priming conditions did not affect the number of relevant ideas produced (F(1,50) = .93, p
= .341), nor did task order (F(1,50) = .008, p = .930).
The findings on novelty, workability, and relevance, taken together, provide full
support for Hypothesis 1b. The a priori achievement prime significantly increases the
creativity of ideas produced in subsequent EBS sessions.

3.4.2. A priori priming and time
3.4.2.1. Idea fluency and time
Individuals produced significantly more ideas in the achievement treatment
compared to the neutral treatment during the first half of the EBS session (F(1,50) =
12.638, p = .001). The effect size was small with a Cohen’s d = .21. The order in which
the participant received the priming conditions did not affect the number of ideas
produced in the first half of the EBS session (F(1,50) = .363, p = .550), nor did task order
(F(1,50) = .191, p = .664). These findings support Hypothesis 2a and the a priori

40

achievement priming effect appears to have an immediate influence on idea fluency. The
means, standard deviations, and results are provided in Table 1.2.
In addition, individuals produced significantly more ideas in the achievement
treatment compared to the neutral treatment during the last half of the EBS session
(F(1,50) = 8.045, p = .007). The effect size was small with a Cohen’s d = .28. The order
in which the participant received the priming conditions did not affect the number of
ideas produced in the last half of the EBS session (F(1,50) = 3.547, p = .065), nor did the
task order (F(1,50) = .145, p = .705). Therefore, Hypothesis 2b was not supported, the
priming effect generated by the a priori achievement prime persists longer than the first
half of the EBS session. The means, standard deviations, and results are provided in
Table 1.3.
In addition to the hypothesis tests, I also compared the first half achievement idea
fluency against the last half of achievement with a post-hoc pairwise comparison. The
number of ideas generated in the first half of an EBS session after the achievement prime
did not significantly differ from the last half of ideas generated in an EBS session after
the achievement treatment (t(104) = 1.36, p = .176). However, the number of ideas
produced during the first half of the EBS session in the neutral treatment significantly
differed from the number of ideas produced in the last half of the EBS session of the
neutral treatment (t(104) = 1.98, p = .05). This indicates that a priori achievement
priming produces a priming effect that persists longer than the neutral (i.e., placebo)
prime.
3.4.2.2. Idea creativity and time
Individuals produced a greater number of novel ideas following the a priori
achievement priming treatment during the first half of an EBS session when compared to
41

neutral (F(1,50) = 117.04, p < .001). The effect size was medium with Cohen’s d =.435.
The order in which the participant received the priming conditions did not affect the
number of novel ideas produced (F(1,50) = .21, p = .653), nor did the order in which he
or she received the pollution or tourism task (F(1,50) = 2.36, p = .131).
Individuals produced a greater number of workable ideas following the a priori
achievement prime during the first half of an EBS session when compared to neutral
(F(1,50) = 166.34, p < .001 ). The effect size was small with a Cohen’s d = .302. The
order in which the participant received the priming conditions did not affect the number
of workable ideas produced (F(1,50) = .54, p .466), nor did task order (F(1,50) = .066, p
= .798).
Individuals produced a greater number of relevant ideas following the a priori
achievement prime during the first half of an EBS session when compared to neutral
(F(1,50) = 127.45, p < .001). The effect size was small with Cohen’s d = .388 . The order
in which the participant received the priming conditions did not affect the number of
relevant ideas produced (F(1,50) = .04, p = .847), nor did task order (F(1,50) = 3.14, p =
.083). These findings support Hypothesis 3a. The means, standard deviations, and results
are provided in Table 1.2.
Similarly, individuals produced a greater number of novel ideas following the a
priori achievement priming treatment during the last half of an EBS session when
compared to neutral (F(1,50) = 9.80, p = .003). The effect size was small with Cohen’s d
= .358. The order in which the participant received the priming conditions did not affect
the number of novel ideas produced (F(1,50) = .043, p = .837), nor did the order in which
he or she received the pollution or tourism task (F(1,50) = .29, p = .596).

42

Individuals produced a greater number of workable ideas following the a priori
achievement prime during the last half of an EBS session when compared to neutral
(F(1,50) = 6.72, p = .012). The effect size was small with a Cohen’s d = .243. The order
in which the participant received the priming conditions did not affect the number of
workable ideas produced (F(1,50) = 1.10, p = .300), nor did task order (F(1,50) = .40, p =
.529).
Individuals produced a greater number of relevant ideas following the a priori
achievement prime during the last half of an EBS session when compared to neutral
(F(1,50) = 12.36, p = .001). The effect size was medium with Cohen’s d = .403. The
order in which the participant received the priming conditions did not affect the number
of relevant ideas produced (F(1,50) = .93, p = .341), nor did task order (F(1,50) = .008, p
= .930). These findings do not support Hypothesis 3b and indicate that the achievement
priming effect persists past the first half of the EBS session. The means, standard
deviations, and results are provided in Table 1.3.

3.4.3. Changes in Cognition
3.4.3.1. Event-related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) analysis
The K-means cluster analysis produced three neurological clusters of interest.
These were selected initially according to the number of subjects and ICs represented in
each cluster and were supported by visual inspection of the corresponding scalp maps.
Scalp maps provide information as to the dispersion of activity within a frequency band
across the scalp. Due to the idiosyncratic nature of neural activity within each participant,
some individuals did not produce independent components in each cluster. One cluster,
for example, contained data from 32 subjects, meaning 13 of the 45 usable EEG subjects
did not produce neural responses statistically related to the others in the regions identified
by the cluster. This may be explained by differences in brain lateralization and structure
among participants in the study. Another possibility is the signal-to-noise ratio in the
EEG signal is smaller than other types of bioelectrical activity. Participants which
produced many muscular artifacts may have produced ICs that were predominated by the
much larger variance created by these muscle movement (and not neural activity).
We set the statistical threshold at (p < .05) and corrected for multiple comparisons
using the false discovery rate (FDR). FDR uses the approach of Benjamini & Hochberg
(Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) to minimize Type I error with only a marginal loss of
statistical power (see Appendix B for more information).
The first cluster is geographically distributed across the right frontal areas of
cortex with a strong activation apparent in this region. This cluster contained data from

44

37 subjects and 50 ICs. This cluster appears to be highly localized to the right frontal lobe
and is not geographically diverse (See Figure 1.1). Right frontal activation has been
shown to be associated with creativity and divergent thinking on tasks (Carlsson et al.
2000; Razoumnikova 2000).
T-tests comparing the achievement prime and neutral prime are presented in
Figure 1.1. After exposure to the achievement prime, individuals showed significant
alpha attenuation (i.e., increased attention) (Panel 1) as compared to the neutral condition
(Panel 2). Panel 3 shows areas where they significantly differed. Alpha band differences
were detected between 4000ms and 2000ms before the subject entered ideas into the chat
simulator. Furthermore, these changes were evident across the alpha frequency band (813Hz), showing greater cortical attention after the a priori achievement prime in this
region when compared to the a priori neutral prime. This indicates increased cognitive
activity in right frontal in the achievement condition versus the neutral condition.

45

Figure 1.1 ERSP of Right Frontal cluster indicating significant alpha attenuation during ideation
following the achievement prime

The second cluster’s activation is distributed across the left frontal areas of cortex.
35 subjects produced 66 ICs in this cluster (See Figure 1.2). T-tests comparing the
achievement prime and neutral prime are presented in Figure 1.2. Left frontal areas of
cortex are responsible for speech production as well as emotion (Fuster 1988).
After exposure to the achievement prime, individuals showed significant alpha
attenuation in the neutral condition (Panel 2) as compared to the achievement condition
(Panel 1). Panel 3 shows areas where they significantly differed. Alpha band differences
were detected between 4000ms and 2000ms before the subject entered ideas into the chat
simulator. Furthermore, these changes were evident across the alpha frequency band (8-

46

13Hz), showing greater cortical attention after the a priori neutral prime in this region
when compared to the a priori neutral prime. Since the neutral prime is designed to have
no effect, this finding could indicate that the a priori achievement prime “shifts”
cognitive resources from left frontal to right frontal regions of frontal cortex.

Figure 1.2 ERSP of Left Frontal cluster indicating significant alpha attenuation during ideation
following the neutral prime

The third cluster is located posterior to the central sulcus in the right parietal
region. 33 subjects produced 138 ICs in this cluster. This cluster is more geographically
dispersed than the second cluster and shows parietal activation (See Figure 1.3). The
parietal region of cortex is associated with integrating sensory information (Fogassi et al.
2005).

47

T-tests comparing the achievement prime and neutral prime are presented in
Figure 1.3. The a priori priming treatment did not create significant differences in
cognitive processing during ideation in the parietal region of the brain. In a priori
priming, the sensory information that needs to be integrated during the chat is similar
between the two treatments because the achievement and neutral priming was delivered
before the chat session and during the EBS session the chat room interface was similar
across the achievement and neutral conditions.

following the neutral prime

3.4.3.2. Cognitive changes over time
In examining the changes in cognition due to the achievement priming effect in an
EBS session, it is important to examine the cognitive changes in ideation over time. To
48

do this, the same clusters from the full analysis were used and ideas were coded into
occurring in the first half of the EBS session or the last half of the EBS session. ERSPs
were generated for each of the clusters for the first and last half of the EBS session.
The right frontal cluster time analysis showed that significant differences occurred across
the alpha frequency spectrum between the achievement and neutral treatments during the
first half of the EBS session. Significant alpha attenuation (i.e., increased cognition) was
observed in the achievement condition as compared to the neutral condition during the
first half of the EBS session. These changes did not persist during the second half of the
EBS session, indicating the priming effect’s changes in cognition began to wear off
during the second half of the task. Therefore, Hypotheses 8a and 8b are partially
supported, the priming effect’s initial impact on cognition begins to diminish during the
latter stages of the EBS task. The ERSP is shown in Figure 1.4

Figure 1.4 ERSP of Right Frontal cluster indicating significant alpha attenuation during ideation in
the first half of the EBS session following the achievement prime. No significant differences in
cognition were observed in the last half of the EBS session.

49

The left frontal cluster time analysis showed no significant differences occurred
across the alpha frequency spectrum between the achievement and neutral treatments
during the first half of the EBS session. Furthermore, no significant differences were
observed during the second half of the EBS session. The ERSP is shown in Figure 1.5.

Figure 1.5 ERSP of Left Frontal cluster showing no significant differences in cognition during the
first and last half of the EBS session.

The parietal cluster time analysis showed no significant differences occurred
across the alpha frequency spectrum between the achievement and neutral treatments
during the first half of the EBS session. Furthermore, no significant differences were
observed during the second half of the EBS session. The ERSP is shown in Figure 1.6.

and last half of the EBS session.

These EEG results, taken together, indicate that the achievement prime
significantly affects cognition in right frontal cortex, which is associated with creative
and divergent thinking. The priming effect on right frontal cortex decays overtime and is
no longer evident at p = .01 during the last half of the EBS session. The significant
difference observed in left frontal cortex is not observed in the first and last half of the
EBS session, likely due to a lack of statistical power from the decreased number of ideas.
Finally, the third cluster shows no significant differences over the entire EBS session, nor
at the first or last half of the EBS session.
3.4.4. Changes in Emotion
The psychophysiological measures utilized in this study were analyzed using
hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). A two-level model was created with the
psychophysiological measure at the first-level. A 20-second average of skin conductance
and corrugator activation was taken, representing 10 seconds before the subject entered
an idea and the 10 seconds after a subject entered an idea. The treatment and whether the
51

idea was in the first or second half of the chat session were included as indicators in the
first-level HLM model. The second-level of the HLM was the subject.
For skin, a measure of arousal, the results do not indicate a main effect of
achievement (b = -.044, p = .490). This indicates that the a priori prime resulted in no
different arousal between achievement and neutral treatments during the EBS session.
Similarly, corrugator activation, a measure of positive emotional valence, did not
significantly differ between the a priori achievement and neutral priming condition (b =
.043, p = .806). Therefore Hypotheses 5a and 5b are not supported. A table of means and
beta coefficients is provided in Table 1.4.

3.4.4.1. Changes in emotion over time
In delineating whether the behavioral differences in idea fluency and creativity
occur via an emotional or cognitive route, it is important to understand the changes
observed in emotion over time after exposure to an achievement a priori prime. HLM was
used to elucidate changes in emotion between achievement and neutral priming during
the first half and the last half of the EBS session.
For skin conductance, the measure of arousal, a main effect of time was observed
in comparing the first and last half of the EBS session. Arousal significantly decreased
during the last half of the EBS session (b = -0.12, p = .029). However, the interaction of
treatment and half was not significant (b = 0.01, p = .850), indicating the changes in
52

arousal over time in the EBS session were not due to the treatments. This finding likely
indicates that the subjects experienced fatigue towards the end of the EBS session
following the a priori prime, regardless of treatment. Therefore, Hypotheses 6a and 6b are
not supported.
For corrugator, the measure of positive valence, no significant differences were
observed in the first or last half of the EBS session (b = -0.06, p = 0.315). Furthermore,
there was no interaction observed between treatment and first and last half of the EBS
session (b = 0.04, p = 0.585). Therefore, a priori priming did not create changes in
emotion that persisted into the EBS session. Therefore, Hypotheses 7a and 6b are not
supported. A table of means for the first and last half of the ideas generated in the EBS
session is provided in Table 1.5.

Study One: A Priori Priming Discussion and Conclusion
This study examined the changes in behavior, cognition and emotion resulting
from an a priori “achievement” prime. The overarching goals of this study were to
examine whether priming lead to changes in cognition and/or emotion and whether those
changes corresponded with behavioral results. The behavioral findings of this study,
indicate that the a priori achievement prime makes individuals participating in a
simulated team EBS session produce more ideas that are of better quality (i.e., the a priori
53

achievement prime increases both idea fluency and creativity). An examination of the
emotional and cognitive underpinnings of the behavioral change indicates that the
behavioral changes correspond with specific cognitive changes, namely an increase in
activation of right prefrontal cortex.
Previous studies have established that the right prefrontal cortex is associated with
verbal creativity (Martindale 1999; Razoumnikova 2000). In one study, differences were
observed in brain activation using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) associated with
divergent thinking tasks (Folley and Park 2005). The study used a task wherein subjects
generated different uses for everyday objects. It found that increased right prefrontal
activation was associated with increased ability to generate different uses for objects, thus
indicating that right prefrontal activation was associated with generative creative
thinking. The findings of study one, reflecting differences in right prefrontal cortex
between the achievement and neutral conditions, indicate that following the a priori
achievement prime, individuals utilize right prefrontal cortex more than after the neutral
prime (as evidenced by alpha attenuation). This indicates that the achievement prime is
activating a key creative center of the brain more than the neutral prime.
Similarly, there were differences observed in left prefrontal cortex, indicating that
more cognition was being used to generate ideas following the neutral condition. Left
prefrontal cortex contains language generation and working memory functional areas of
the brain. Taken with the right prefrontal findings, these findings indicate that
achievement priming “shifts” cognition to more creative regions of the brain during
ideation (i.e., right prefrontal cortex).

54

One interpretation of these results is that utilizing the creative centers of the brain
enable an individual to generate ideas more easily, thereby increasing the cognitive
resources available to generate more ideas. The time course of the cognitive changes to
right prefrontal cortex observed in this study was as expected. The a priori priming effect
persisted throughout the first half of the EBS session but was no longer statistically
different than the neutral prime in the latter half of the EBS session. However, the
behavioral results indicate that despite cognition in right frontal decreasing in the last
half, the individuals exposed to the achievement prime still generated more ideas than the
individuals in the neutral prime. This finding indicates that the changes in behavior
outlast the initial “boost” in cognition resulting from the a priori achievement prime.
The psychophysiological data in this study did not find any significant differences
relating to ideation following achievement or neutral priming. This finding indicates that
any emotional changes caused by a priori achievement priming are likely to be transient
and do not persist into the following chat session.
The cognitive and emotion findings of study one together, indicate that the
behavioral changes observed in subsequent EBS sessions result from changes in
cognition induced by priming, not emotion (i.e., a priori priming results in behavioral
changes by working through a cognitive route). This study cannot rule out that emotional
changes occurred during the priming session, but it does show that no differences in
emotion were observed during ideation in the EBS session. This finding provides
evidence that the a priori achievement prime’s changes in ideation do not occur through
the emotional route. Study two seeks to investigate if priming an individual concurrently,
as they complete the task, will result in behavioral changes in idea fluency and creativity.

55

It also seeks to uncover if the same pattern of changes in cognition and emotion are
observed as study one, specifically if the changes induced by achievement priming are a
result of changes along the cognitive route.
STUDY TWO: CONCURRENT PRIMING
Introduction to concurrent priming
This study develops a new conceptualization of supraliminal priming, termed
“concurrent” priming. Concurrent priming is the use of real-time priming, alongside a
given task, to affect behavior on that task. Concurrent priming is expected to work in a
similar manner to a priori priming, in that the concept being primed (e.g., achievement)
will result in increased performance on the relevant task. The principle motivation in
creating a concurrent prime it to address the limitations of a priori priming. This study
tests two research questions. The first research question (RQ2a) examines whether
concurrent priming produces the same behavioral changes as a priori priming in
increasing idea fluency and creativity. The second research question examines whether
the changes in behavior occur through a cognitive and/or emotional route. Thus, stated
formally, the research questions are:
RQ2a: Does concurrent priming of achievement increase the fluency and quality of ideas
produced during an EBS session?
RQ2b: In concurrent priming, does the prime affect idea generation performance through
an emotional and/or cognitive route during an EBS session?
Theory and Hypotheses
A priori priming, by definition, is done by priming individuals prior to completing
a task. Therefore, there is generally a priming session lasting several minutes before the
individuals complete the task of interest. Since the prime is removed before the task

56

starts, the priming effect elicited begins to decay as the task commences (DeCoster and
Claypool 2004). As discussed in previous sections, priming effects dissipate at a decay
rate determined by a number of factors such as duration of priming session and stimuli
used (DeCoster and Claypool 2004). As a result, the efficacy of the prime is most
pronounced at the beginning of a task and diminishes as time from the prime elapses. In
tasks, such as EBS, a priori priming is limited in its effectiveness because the priming
effect is most needed in latter stages of the task.
Therefore, the integration of a priori priming into an organizational setting may
be limited due to the priming session requirement and decay effects. Priming techniques
that deliver the prime concurrently within the brainstorming session may be more useful
because the priming effect is being induced in real-time as the individual completes the
task of interest. This study integrates a concurrent prime into the EBS software and
examine effects on idea fluency and creativity.
In the concurrent prime, priming will occur with pictures instead of words since
the scrambled sentence paradigm utilized in the first study would direct too much
attention away from the brainstorming task. Pictures have been shown to be as effective
as words in eliciting priming effects (Carr et al. 1982; Giner-Sorolla et al. 1999). Picture
primes activate semantic networks in a similar way to priming with words by eliciting
semantic interpretations of the pictures (Giner-Sorolla et al. 1999). For example, a picture
of an individual crossing a finish line in first place creates a semantic interpretation along
the lines of “that individual just won the race.” This semantic interpretation activates
mental representations related to achievement in the same manner as working directly
with words related to achievement.

57

Another notable difference in the concurrent prime is that individuals will be
using cognitive resources to complete a brainstorming task as well as to process the
primes. It has been found that people do not need to consciously process the stimuli in
order for a cognitive or emotional state to be invoked (Chartrand et al. 2006). There is
much information present in our visual field constantly, and conscious processing does
not occur for all the stimuli. However, primes presented in the visual field, readily
apparent to an individual, have been shown to influence behavior even if the individual
does not recall the content of the prime (Chartrand et al. 2006).
Since the concept being primed in concurrent priming is “achievement,” the
overall effect on idea fluency and creativity is expected to be similar to a priori priming.
As a result, concurrent priming of the concept “achievement” is expected to increase idea
fluency and creativity in a similar manner as a priori priming. Therefore, I hypothesize:
Hypothesis 1a: Concurrent priming of the concept “achievement” will increase
idea fluency during an EBS session.
Hypothesis 1b: Concurrent priming of the concept “achievement” will increase
idea creativity during an EBS session.
4.2.1. Concurrent priming and time
While the overall effect of the concurrent prime is expected to be the same as a
priori primes, it will likely follow a different time course. In a priori priming, the prime
occurs before the task and behavior on the task is measured. The effect of the prime
wears off as the task unfolds (Bargh and Chartrand 2000). One, relatively common
assumption, in a priori priming is that the priming effect decays at the same rate across
individuals. Therefore, the goal is to design a prime that will produce a priming effect
that persists throughout the subsequent task. However, priming effects likely decay at
different rates across individuals, which results in differential performance in the latter
58

half of the task. This is to say, the relationship between the a priori priming effect and
time during the subsequent task is inverse, as time on the task increases the priming effect
decreases. One can also expect the confidence interval around the relationship to increase
over time, representing varying rates of decay. These varying rates of decay result in
unreliable priming effects at the end of the task.
Concurrent priming is designed to help this problem, in that priming is occurring
during the task. The expected result is that, instead of an inverse relationship between
priming effect and time, there will be a direct relationship. As time on the task unfolds,
the priming effect is expected to build. Toward the beginning of the task/priming session,
the priming effect will be relatively low. However, as the time on the task unfolds, the
priming effect will increase to some individual maxima. Concurrent priming, therefore,
is expected to be most beneficial in tasks where the priming effect is needed later on in
the task, as opposed to right away.
EBS sessions are particularly suited to concurrent priming. In an EBS session,
generally, there is a flood of ideas during the first minutes of the task, eventually settling
into an ebb and flow of ideas in the latter stages of the task (Shepherd et al. 1995). In the
latter stages of EBS sessions, the number of new ideas generated are few in comparison
to the beginning of the task. Since priming has been shown to increase ideation fluency
and creativity (Dennis et al. 2013; Postmes et al. 2001), it is probable that ideation in the
latter parts of the task could be most susceptible to priming effects. Specifically, the
beginning parts of EBS sessions, wherein many ideas are generated, could be nearing a
ceiling effect where influences of priming simply cannot result in greater idea generation.
However, towards the end of the task, the generation of more ideas is possible.

59

Concurrent priming is theorized to produce a priming effect that increases during the
beginning of the task and is present in the latter stages of the task. As a result, the priming
effect in concurrent priming, unlike a priori priming, is expected to offset ideation
declines in the middle and late stages of the task. Therefore, EBS ideation performance
could garner even a greater benefit with concurrent priming.
One consideration that must be taken into account with concurrent priming is the
effect of being primed while working on a task. Since completing a task while being
primed will place demands on cognitive resources, it is important to consider the effect of
increased cognitive load on an individual’s priming susceptibility. One meta-analysis on
a priori priming found mixed results in the research literature. Increased cognitive load
was found to increase susceptibility to primes, resulting in an increased overall priming
effect (DeCoster and Claypool 2004). Under normal circumstances, people with
sufficient cognitive resources will begin to exhibit an unconscious resistance to the
primes, attenuating the overall priming effect (DeCoster and Claypool 2004). However,
when cognitive load is high, people are slower to develop resistance away from the
priming effect, resulting in greater susceptibility to the prime (DeCoster and Claypool
2004).
Therefore, it is expected that concurrent priming will influence idea generation in
the latter stages of the task.
Hypothesis 2a: Concurrent priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
similar idea generation as neutral priming during the first half of an EBS session.
Hypothesis 2b: Concurrent priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
greater idea fluency than neutral priming during the last half of an EBS session.
Idea creativity has also been shown to be influenced by achievement priming
(Dennis et al. 2013). It is expected that, during a concurrent EBS session, creativity will
60

also increase as the time unfolds. During the beginning of the task, creativity will likely
be similar in achievement and neutral priming conditions, whereas, in the latter parts of
the task, priming is likely to become differentiated between the achievement and neutral
priming conditions. Therefore, I hypothesize:
Hypothesis 3a: Concurrent priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
similar idea creativity as neutral priming during the first half of an EBS session.
Hypothesis 3b: Concurrent priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
increased idea creativity than neutral priming during the last half of an EBS
session.
4.2.2. Priming induced changes in psychophysiology
Since concurrent priming, using pictures, is expected to activate the same
semantic networks as a priori priming with words, the overall effect on cognition and
emotion is expected to be similar. Changes in cognition, specifically attention, will occur
after exposure to a concurrent, achievement prime. In this study, a concurrent prime is
used. The prime is expected to have a similar effect on cognition measured as greater
alpha attenuation in the frontal cortices after exposure to the achievement-oriented prime.
Given the close relationship between frontal alpha-wave activity and attention, I
hypothesize:
Hypothesis 4: Concurrent priming of the concept of achievement, as compared to
a neutral prime, will increase attention during ideation in an EBS session.
Repeated exposure to positive pictures, much like repeated exposure to positive
words has shown to increase positive valence, while repeated exposure to negative
pictures has been shown to increase negative valence (Bradley and Lang 1994; Kensinger
and Schacter 2006). Therefore, I expect concurrent achievement priming to result in
increased positive valence. Increased positive valence can be measured by the corrugator
supercilli muscle becoming relatively more deactivated following exposure to the prime.
61

In addition, exposure to a concurrent achievement prime is expected to increase
sympathetic nervous system activation (i.e., increased arousal), resulting in increased skin
conductance in subsequent ideation during an EBS session. Therefore, the hypotheses for
the effect of concurrent priming on emotional psychophysiological response are:
Hypothesis 5a: Concurrent priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
a physiological response that indicates more positive valence than neutral
priming during ideation in an EBS session.
Hypothesis 5b: Concurrent priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
a physiological response that indicates increased arousal than neutral priming
during ideation in an EBS session.
4.2.3. Changes in cognition and emotion over time
While the overall psychophysiological changes in cognition and emotion are
expected to be similar to a priori priming, the time course over the EBS session is
expected to be different. Specifically, the opposite pattern will be observed. The EBS
session will begin with similar levels of attention, valence, and arousal between
achievement and neutral priming. However, as the achievement prime begins to elicit the
priming effect, cognitive and emotional psychophysiological response will diverge.
Levels of attention observed in the achievement priming condition, as measured by alpha
attenuation, are expected to be higher than in the neutral priming condition. Similarly, the
levels of valence and arousal observed across the priming conditions will begin at similar
levels but, in the latter stages of the EBS session, will diverge. Higher valence is expected
in the achievement priming condition during the middle and last third of the task when
compared to valence levels in the neutral priming condition. In addition, greater arousal
is expected in the achievement priming condition during the middle and last third of the
task when compared to valence levels in the neutral priming condition. Therefore,

62

Hypothesis 6a: Concurrent priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
no different valence than neutral priming during ideation in the first half of an
EBS session.
Hypothesis 6b: Concurrent priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
more positive valence than neutral priming during ideation in the last half of an
EBS session.
Hypothesis 7a: Concurrent priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
no different arousal than neutral priming during ideation in the first half of an
EBS session.
Hypothesis 7b: Concurrent priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
increased arousal than neutral priming during ideation in the last half of an EBS
session.
Hypothesis 8a: Concurrent priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
similar attention, as measured by alpha attenuation in the frontal cortices, than
neutral priming during ideation in the first half of an EBS session.
Hypothesis 8b: Concurrent priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
greater attention, as measured by alpha attenuation in the frontal cortices, than
neutral priming during ideation in the last half of an EBS session.
Study Two: Concurrent Priming Methodology
4.3.1. Participants
Fifty-six students were recruited from the same introductory business course as
study one. The course consisted of sophomores and juniors, and participants completed
the study for extra credit. Demographic variables were obtained to provide average age
and gender distribution. Age ranged from 18 to 25 with the average age being 20 years of
age. Thirty-one participants (55.4%) were male and 25 participants were female (44.6%).
4.3.2. Tasks
The same EBS tasks were used in study two as in study one. There was one 15
minute task on generating ideas to reduce pollution and one 15 minute task on increasing
tourism.
4.3.3. Treatments
63

The second study was a repeated measures experiment using concurrent priming
with pictures. Each participant received two within subject treatments: achievement
priming and neutral priming. Participants generated ideas using the simulator from study
one, but with priming delivered by pictures presented in a banner on the right side of the
screen. Participants in this treatment group generated ideas while they were being primed.
The image in the right hand banner updated to a new image every 20 seconds, and there
were 30 different pictures presented in each task. The pictures were presented in
landscape format with a resolution of 400 x 300 pixels.
The achievement priming condition for concurrent priming consisted of a set of
30 images oriented towards the concept of “achievement,” while the neutral priming
condition consists of 30 images designed to have no effect. The images for the
achievement and neutral priming conditions were rated by a group of students on
achievement, arousal, and valence. Examples of the achievement and neutral images are
provided in Appendix C of this document. The achievement-oriented images significantly
differed from neutral images on achievement rating by students (t(58) =7.87, p < .001)
(for a full summary of results see Appendix A). Arousal was rated on a scale form 1 (low
arousal) to 9 (high arousal), and valence is rated from 1 (negative) and 9 (positive). The
neutral images were moderate in arousal (M = 4.64, S.D. = 0.39) and moderate in valence
(M = 5.32, S.D. = 0.49). The achievement priming images had higher arousal (M = 5.14,
S.D. = 0.41) and more positive valence (M = 5.47, S.D. = 0.61). The achievement
priming images significantly differed from the neutral priming words on both arousal
(t(58) = 4.41, p < .001) and valence (t(58) = 3.75, p < .001).
4.3.3.1. Dependent Variables

64

The dependent variables were the same as study one and consisted of both
behavioral and physiological measures.
4.3.3.2. Behavioral Measures
The behavioral measures were the same as Study One. Idea fluency, measured as
number of unique ideas generated, and creativity measures were collected. As in study
one, the creativity measures included assessment of novelty, workability, and relevance
to obtain a measure of overall creativity and total number of creative ideas.
4.3.3.3. Physiological Measures
The physiological measures were the same as study one and included EEG
measures, as well as, psychophysiological measures and skin conductance.
4.3.4. Control Variables
The control variables were the same as in Study One.
4.3.5. Procedure
The procedure of study two was similar to study one. However, the prime was
delivered concurrently with the EBS session. Participants completed the experimental
procedure individually after providing informed consent approved by the university’s
Institutional Review Board. The experiment took place in an individual lab room at a
research institute. The entire research session took approximately 60 minutes. The
surveys presented in the experiment were controlled by MediaLab software (Jarvis 2010).
The simulator software was developed using a Unity gaming shell.
Similarly to study one, participants were seated in a high back chair to minimize
movement. They used a standard keyboard and mouse. The protocol began with a 10minute series of personality questionnaires. The experimenter then explained the
procedure for attaching the physiological electrodes and fitting the EEG apparatus,
65

answering any questions posed by the participant. After obtaining adequate impedance
readings for the EMG and EEG measures, the protocol continued with another brief
handedness questionnaire.
The participants were randomly assigned to either the neutral or achievement
priming condition. In addition, task order was counterbalanced with 31 participants
receiving the pollution task first and 30 receiving the tourism task first. Participants then
worked on the first EBS task for fifteen minutes. Next they completed a short survey to
serve as a “distractor” between treatments. Participants repeated these same steps
(priming game, idea generation) for the second priming manipulation and task. The
participants were debriefed and the session concluded.
In total, the EEG apparatus was on the participants for approximately 45 minutes,
during which the electrodes remained damp with the saline solution. Markers were
inserted into the data by the simulation software, indicating when an idea had been
entered into the chat room. This allowed for synchronization between the EBS session,
EEG and EMG systems. When the discussion simulation was completed, the
experimenter removed all physiological data collection sensors. Participants then
completed the post-experiment questionnaire. Finally, they were be debriefed, told of the
deception, asked not to inform others of the deception, and thanked for their time.
4.3.6. Manipulation Checks
Again for study two, it was essential to ensure that participants perceived the
simulator as a real team discussion. All participants completed post-session
questionnaires that asked if they have noticed anything unusual about the team
discussion. A variety of distractor questions (e.g., satisfaction with discussion, perceived
effectiveness) were also included to better ensure that manipulation check question did
66

not stand out. Participants that recognized they were not interacting with real people were
be removed from the study as failing the manipulation check. Eight of the 56 participants
recognized they were not interacting with a simulator and were removed from the
analysis, leaving 48 participants in the study. This represents a 14.3% of individuals
failing the manipulation check, which is in line with prior studies ranging to 10-15% of
the subjects failing manipulation checks (Garfield et al. 2001; Heninger et al. 2006).
Study Two: Concurrent priming results
4.4.1. Behavioral results
The statistical analyses for the behavioral component of study one were
completed in SPSS PASW Statistics 18.0. A repeated-measures GLM was used to
examine differences between the achievement and neutral priming conditions.
4.4.1.1. Idea fluency
Individuals produced significantly more ideas during the concurrent priming
condition with achievement priming pictures than with neutral priming pictures (F(1,45)
= 9.58, p = .003). The effect size was small with a Cohen’s d of 0.27. The order in which
the group received priming treatments did not affect the number of unique ideas
generated (F(1,45) = 0.78, p = .383), nor did the task order for the pollution and tourism
task (F(1,45) = 0.25, p = .618). Therefore, Hypothesis 1a was supported, the concurrent
achievement prime led to significantly more ideas than the concurrent neutral prime.
4.4.1.2. Idea Creativity
Individuals produced a greater number of novel ideas following the concurrent
achievement priming treatment than the neutral (F(1,45) = 5.75, p = .021). The effect size
was medium with Cohen’s d = .413. The order in which the participant receive d the
priming conditions did not affect the number of novel ideas produced (F(1,45) = 1.98, p =
67

.167), nor did the order in which he or she received the pollution or tourism task (F(1,45)
= 0.34, p = .564).
Individuals produced a greater number of workable ideas following the concurrent
achievement prime than the neutral prime (F(1,45) = 13.97, p = .001). The effect size
was medium with a Cohen’s d = .423. The order in which the participant received the
priming conditions did not affect the number of workable ideas produced (F(1,45) = 1.12,
p = .295), nor did task order (F(1,45) = 0.09, p = .763).
Individuals produced a greater number of relevant ideas following the concurrent
achievement prime than the neutral prime (F(1,45) = 12.52, p = .001). The effect size
was small with Cohen’s d = .366 . The order in which the participant received the
priming conditions did not affect the number of relevant ideas produced (F(1,45) = 0.018,
p = .893), nor did task order (F(1,45) = 1.307, p = .259).
The findings on novelty, workability, and relevance, taken together, provide full
support for Hypothesis 1b. The concurrent achievement prime significantly increases the
creativity of ideas produced in during an EBS session.3.

4.4.2. Concurrent priming and time: Behavioral Analysis
4.4.2.1. Idea fluency and time

68

Individuals produced significantly more ideas in the achievement treatment
compared to the neutral treatment during the first half of the EBS session (F(1,45) =
81.68, p < .001). The effect size was small with a Cohen’s d = .31. The order in which
the participant received the priming conditions did not affect the number of ideas
produced in the first half of the EBS session (F(1,45) = .133, p = .717), nor did task order
(F(1,45) = .358, p = .553). These findings support the alternate to Hypothesis 2a, the
concurrent achievement priming effect appears to have an influence on idea fluency
during the first half of the brainstorming session. The means, standard deviations, and
results are provided in Table 1.2.
In addition, individuals produced significantly more ideas in the achievement
treatment compared to the neutral treatment during the last half of the EBS session
(F(1,45) = 9.58, p = .003). The effect size was small with a Cohen’s d = .17. The order in
which the participant received the priming conditions did not affect the number of ideas
produced in the last half of the EBS session (F(1,45) = .775, p = .383), nor did the task
order (F(1,45) = .253, p = .618). Therefore, Hypothesis 2b was supported, the priming
effect generated by the concurrent achievement prime impacts the last half of the EBS
session when compared to the neutral prime. The means, standard deviations, and results
are provided in Table 1.3.
In addition to the tests of the hypotheses, I also compared the first half of
concurrent achievement idea fluency against the last half of achievement with a post-hoc
pairwise comparison. The number of ideas generated in the first half of an EBS session
after the achievement prime was significantly higher than the last half of ideas generated
in an EBS session after the achievement treatment (t(94) = 4.52, p < .001). In addition,

69

the number of ideas produced during the first half of the EBS session in the neutral
treatment significantly differed from the number of ideas produced in the last half of the
EBS session of the neutral treatment (t(94) = 4.47, p < .001). This indicates that the
concurrent achievement prime produces a priming effect that has more of an influence on
the first half of the EBS session. However, the achievement treatment still significantly
differed from the neutral treatment in the last half of the EBS session.
4.4.2.2. Idea creativity and time
Individuals produced a greater number of novel ideas following the concurrent
achievement priming treatment during the first half of an EBS session when compared to
neutral (F(1,45) = 64.16, p < .001). The effect size was medium with Cohen’s d = .442 .
The order in which the participant received the priming conditions did not affect the
number of novel ideas produced (F(1,45) = 1.46, .233), nor did the order in which he or
she received the pollution or tourism task (F(1,45) = .05, p = .823).
Individuals produced a greater number of workable ideas following the concurrent
achievement prime during the first half of an EBS session when compared to neutral
(F(1,45) = 226.08, p < .001). The effect size was medium with a Cohen’s d = .429. The
order in which the participant received the priming conditions did not affect the number
of workable ideas produced (F(1,45) = 1.04, p = .313), nor did task order (F(1,45) = 0.20,
p = .661).
Individuals produced a greater number of relevant ideas following the concurrent
achievement prime during the first half of an EBS session when compared to neutral
(F(1,45) = 215.20, p < .001). The effect size was medium with Cohen’s d = .433. The
order in which the participant received the priming conditions did not affect the number
of relevant ideas produced (F(1,45) = .19, p = 661), nor did task order (F(1,45) = .18, p =
70

.671). These findings support the alternate to Hypothesis 3a, indicating the concurrent
prime has an impact during the early stages of the task. The means, standard deviations,
and results are provided in Table 1.2.
Similarly, individuals produced a greater number of novel ideas following the
concurrent achievement priming treatment during the last half of an EBS session when
compared to neutral (F(1,45) = 5.75, p = .021). The effect size was small with Cohen’s d
= .297. The order in which the participant received the priming conditions did not affect
the number of novel ideas produced (F(1,45) = 1.98, p = .167), nor did the order in which
he or she received the pollution or tourism task (F(1,45) = 0.338, p = .564).
Individuals produced a greater number of workable ideas following the concurrent
achievement prime during the last half of an EBS session when compared to neutral
(F(1,45) = 13.974, p = .001). The effect size was small with a Cohen’s d = .237. The
order in which the participant received the priming conditions did not affect the number
of workable ideas produced (F(1,45) = 1.122, p = .295), nor did task order (F(1,45) = .09,
p = .763).
Individuals produced a greater number of relevant ideas following the concurrent
achievement prime during the last half of an EBS session when compared to neutral
(F(1,45) = 12.52, p = .001). The effect size was small with Cohen’s d = .256. The order
in which the participant received the priming conditions did not affect the number of
relevant ideas produced (F(1,45) = .02, p = .893), nor did task order (F(1,45) = 1.31, p =
.259). These findings support Hypothesis 3b and indicate that the achievement priming
effects both the first and latter stages of the EBS task. The means, standard deviations,
and results are provided in Table 1.3.

4.4.3. Changes in Cognition
4.4.3.1. Event-related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) analysis
Similarly to study one, the K-means cluster analysis produced three neurological
clusters of interest. These were selected initially according to the number of subjects and
ICs represented in each cluster and were supported by visual inspection of the
corresponding scalp maps. Scalp maps provide information as to the dispersion of
activity within a frequency band across the scalp. Due to the idiosyncratic nature of
neural activity within each participant, some individuals did not produce independent
components in each cluster. One cluster, for example, contained data from 32 subjects,
meaning 16 of the 48 usable EEG subjects did not produce neural responses statistically
related to the others in the regions identified by the cluster. This may be explained by
differences in brain lateralization and structure among participants in the study. Another
possibility is the signal-to-noise ratio in the EEG signal is smaller than other types of
72

bioelectrical activity. Participants which produced many muscular artifacts may have
produced ICs that were predominated by the much larger variance created by these
muscle movement (and not neural activity).
The first cluster is geographically distributed across the right frontal areas of
cortex with a strong activation apparent in this region. This cluster contained data from
32 subjects and 99 ICs. This cluster appears to be highly localized to the right frontal lobe
with some dispersion to left frontal cortex as well (See Figure 2.1). This cluster is similar
to the right frontal cluster observed in study one. The study one cluster seems to be
located more medially than this one in study two. Likewise, this cluster is less
concentrated that the similar cluster in Study 1. The right frontal activation could be
indicative of increased creativity on the task, which has been shown in prior studies to be
a region of the brain responsible for creativity and divergent thinking (Carlsson et al.
2000; Razoumnikova 2000).
T-tests of the achievement prime and neutral prime are presented in Figure 2.1,
Individuals showed significant alpha attenuation (i.e., increased cognition) (Panel 1) in
the achievement prime as compared to the neutral condition (Panel 2). Panel 3 shows
areas where they significantly differed. Alpha band differences were detected between
4000ms and 2500ms before the subject entered ideas into the chat simulator.
Furthermore, these changes were evident across the alpha frequency band (8-13Hz),
showing greater cortical attention after the a priori achievement prime in this region when
compared to the a priori neutral prime. This is indicative of the subjects using more
cognitive resources in the creative regions of the brain during the achievement priming
condition when compared to the neutral priming condition.

73

Figure 2.1 ERSP of Right Frontal cluster indicating significant alpha attenuation during ideation
following the concurrent achievement prime

The second cluster is similar to the left frontal cluster observed in study one. This
cluster is distributed across the left frontal areas of cortex with a strong activation
apparent in this region near Broca’s Area (the language generation region of the brain).
The cluster in study two is slightly more lateral and concentrated near Broca’s than the
cluster observed in study one. This cluster contained data from 31 subjects and 128 ICs.
This cluster appears to be highly localized to the left frontal lobe than the analogous
cluster from study one (See Figure 2.2). This region is heavily involved in cognitive load
and language production.

74

T-tests of the achievement prime and neutral prime are presented in Figure 2.2.
After exposure to the achievement prime, individuals showed no different alpha
attenuation during the achievement condition (Panel 1) as compared to the neutral
condition (Panel 2). Panel 3 shows no areas where they significantly differed. This
finding indicates that the achievement-oriented prime did not significantly change
cognition in the language production areas of the brain as it did in the a priori prime in
study one.

Figure 2.2 ERSP of Left Frontal cluster indicating significant alpha attenuation during ideation
following the concurrent achievement prime

The third cluster is similar to the parietal cluster observed in study one. It is
localized to an area posterior to the central sulcus in the parietal lobe. During the
concurrent prime, the participants were exposed to images as well as the chat room.
75

These images differed between treatments. The parietal lobe is responsible for integrating
sensory information and relaying it to frontal regions for further processing. This cluster
contained data from 31 subjects and 204 ICs (See Figure 2.3).
T-tests of the achievement prime and neutral prime are presented in Figure 2.3.
After exposure to the achievement prime, individuals showed significantly different alpha
attenuation during the achievement condition (Panel 1) as compared to the neutral
condition (Panel 2). Panel 3 shows no areas where they significantly differed. Subjects
showed significantly different alpha attenuation (i.e., increased attention in the
achievement condition) from -4000 ms to -2500 ms across the alpha frequency band.
These findings could indicate that the individuals were processing the achievement
related pictures, embedded in the chat session during the task, differently from the neutral
images.

76

the concurrent achievement prime

4.4.3.2. Cognitive changes over time
In examining the changes in cognition due to the concurrent achievement priming
effect in an EBS session, it is important to examine the cognitive changes in ideation over
time. To do this, the same clusters from the full analysis were used and ideas were coded
into occurring in the first half of the EBS session or the last half of the EBS session.
ERSPs were generated for each of the clusters for the first and last half of the EBS
session.
The right frontal cluster time analysis showed that no significant differences were
observed between achievement and neutral priming during the first half of the EBS
session. Some significant alpha attenuation (i.e., increased cognition) was observed in the

77

achievement condition as compared to the neutral condition during the last half of the
EBS session. However, differences in cognition were only observed around the middle
and lower alpha frequency band from -3000 to -2500ms. While the images do look
different in the last half, there likely was not enough statistical power to uncover the
differences, due to the lower amount of ideas in the second half. Therefore, Hypotheses
8a and 8b are partially supported, the priming effect’s impact on cognition is apparent
during the latter stages of the EBS task. The ERSPs are shown in Figure 2.4

Figure 2.4 ERSP of Right Frontal cluster indicating significant alpha attenuation during ideation in
the last half of the EBS session during the achievement prime. No significant differences in cognition
were observed in the first half of the EBS session.

The left frontal cluster time analysis showed no significant differences occurred
across the alpha frequency spectrum between the achievement and neutral treatments
during the first half of the EBS session. Furthermore, no significant differences were
observed during the second half of the EBS session. The ERSPs are shown in Figure 2.5.
This finding indicates that in the speech production region of the brain, there was no

78

significantly different cognition during ideation in either the first or last half of the EBS
session.

Figure 2.5 ERSP of Left Frontal cluster showing no significant differences in cognition during the
first and last half of the EBS session.

The parietal cluster time analysis showed no significant differences occurred
across the alpha frequency spectrum between the achievement and neutral treatments
during the first half of the EBS session. Furthermore, no significant differences were
observed during the second half of the EBS session. The ERSPs are shown in Figure 2.6.

79

Figure 2.6 ERSP of Parietal cluster showing no significant differences in cognition during the first
and last half of the EBS session.

These EEG results, taken together, indicate that the concurrent achievement prime
significantly affects cognition in right frontal cortex, much like study one. This region is
often associated with creative and divergent thinking. The cognitive changes of the
priming effect are evident in right frontal during the last half of the EBS session. There
were no significant differences observed in left frontal (i.e., Broca’s area, language
production). Finally, the third cluster shows significant differences over the entire EBS
session, but not when taken at the first or last half of the EBS session, likely due to a lack
of statistical power after the ideas were split.
4.4.4. Changes in Emotion
The psychophysiological measures utilized in this study were analyzed using
hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). A two-level model was created with the
psychophysiological measure at the first-level. A 20-second average of skin conductance
and corrugator activation was taken, representing 10 seconds before the subject entered
an idea and the 10 seconds after a subject entered an idea. The treatment and whether the
80

idea was in the first or second half of the chat session was included as indicators in the
HLM model. The second-level of the HLM included an indicator representing the subject
number.
For skin, a measure of arousal, the results do not indicate a main effect of
achievement (b = .011, p = .805). This indicates that the concurrent prime resulted in no
different arousal between achievement and neutral treatments during the EBS session.
Similarly, corrugator activation, a measure of positive emotional valence, did not
significantly differ between the concurrent achievement and neutral priming condition (b
= -.081, p = .361). Therefore Hypotheses 5a and 5b are not supported. A table of means
and beta coefficients is provided in Table 2.4.

4.4.4.1. Emotional changes over time
In delineating whether the behavioral differences in idea fluency and creativity
occur via an emotional or cognitive route for the concurrent prime, it is important to
understand the changes observed in emotion over time after exposure to an achievement
concurrent prime. HLM was used to observe these changes in emotion between
achievement and neutral priming during ideation in the first half and the last half of the
EBS session.
For skin conductance, the measure of arousal, no main effect of time was
observed (b = -0.17, p = .689). Furthermore, the interaction of treatment and half was not
81

significant (b = 0.02, p = .634). Therefore, Hypotheses 6a and 6b are not supported. For
corrugator, the measure of positive valence, no significant differences were observed in
the first or last half of the EBS session (b = -0.09, p = 0.088). Furthermore, there was no
interaction observed between treatment and first and last half of the EBS session (b =
0.02, p = 0.811). Therefore, concurrent priming did not create changes in emotional state
of the subjects in either arousal or valence during ideation in the EBS session. Therefore,
Hypotheses 7a and 7b are not supported. A table of means for the first and last half of the
ideas generated in the EBS session is provided in Table 2.5.

Study Two: Concurrent Priming Discussion and Conclusion
This study examined the changes in behavior, cognition and emotion resulting
from a concurrent “achievement” prime integrated into the EBS tool. There were two
primary goals to this study. The first was to examine whether the concurrent prime led to
behavioral differences in idea fluency and creativity. The second was to investigate if the
changes in behavior were a result of cognitive or emotional changes induced by the
achievement prime.
The behavioral findings of this study, indicate that the concurrent achievement
prime makes individuals participating in a simulated team EBS session produce more
ideas that are of better quality (i.e., the concurrent achievement prime increases idea
82

fluency and creativity). An examination of the emotional and cognitive underpinnings of
the behavioral differences indicates that these changes, much like study one, correspond
with specific cognitive changes, specifically an increase in activation of right prefrontal
cortex.
These findings are similar to the findings in study one and indicate an increased
use of areas of the brain associated with creativity when individuals are being exposed
concurrently to an achievement prime. The differences in left frontal cortex that were
observed in a priori priming in study one were not observed when the individuals were
being primed concurrently in study two, indicating similar activation of the regions
associated with working memory and language production between the concurrent
treatments in study two.
Analysis of the time course of the priming effect generated by the concurrent
prime indicates that the prime resulted in significant differences in cognition in right
frontal during the last half of the EBS session. The differences were not observed in right
frontal cortex during the first half of the EBS session. This conforms to the hypotheses
that the priming effect takes time to impact cognition. Behaviorally, the individuals
generated more ideas during the first and last half of the EBS session during the
achievement prime when compared to the neutral prime.
The psychophysiological results indicate that there are no changes in emotion
during ideation when being exposed to the achievement prime. Individuals had similar
arousal and valence levels regardless of being exposed to the achievement or neutral
images. This again supports the findings in study one, changes in idea fluency and
creativity correspond to changes in cognition, not emotion.

83

This study provides significant value for management and the design of EBS
systems, in that it indicates that it is possible to impact idea generation in an EBS session
without needing to have an artificial 5-10 minute “priming” session beforehand. Study
three delves deeper into the content of the images, specifically whether generic positive
images create the same priming effect as images that are related to achievement. In
addition, it seeks to elucidate whether these changes are tied to cognitive changes,
emotional changes, or both.
STUDY THREE: ACHIEVEMENT VERSUS POSITIVE PRIMING
Introduction
The third study of this dissertation examines further whether the changes in
ideation in electronic brainstorming are a result of the pictures being closely related to
achievement or because achievement pictures are positive in both arousal and emotional
valence (i.e., the pictures tend to be positive and happy pictures). As in study two, I use a
concurrent prime to address research question three (RQ3). This study will delineate
whether the achievement pictures significantly differ from other non-achievement,
pictures that are also rated as high in arousal and positive valence. Thus, stated formally,
the research questions for this study is:
RQ3: In concurrent priming, do the changes in ideation occur from the achievementoriented nature of the images or the positive valence and arousal of the images?
Theory and hypotheses
Previous a priori priming literature has found that priming the concept of
achievement activates an automatic goal to succeed, which in turn leads to better
performance on tasks (Bargh et al. 2001). However, this study did not examine the
arousal and valence of the words in the positive and neutral priming conditions.
84

Therefore, it is possible that the effect of the prime was related to the strong correlation
between achievement-oriented words and the tendency for those words to be rated as
high in both arousal and positive valence when compared to neutral words. The argument
put forth by Bargh et al, is that achievement-oriented words activate semantic networks
within the brain that correspond to succeeding, thus increasing the motivation for
individuals to achieve (Bargh et al. 2001).
This dissertation seeks to establish whether the achievement prime works through
a cognitive or emotional route, or potentially both. If the achievement-oriented prime
only activates an individual’s semantic network related to achievement, then one would
expect an increase in fluency and creativity of ideas that occurs through priming the
concept of achievement. However, if emotional changes occur in addition to activation of
the semantic networks during achievement priming, then one would expect images that
were high in arousal and positive valence to increase the fluency and creativity of ideas
as well (i.e., cognitive and emotional changes induce similar ideation). In this scenario,
the differences observed in concurrent priming of achievement and other pictures rated
high in arousal and positive valence would produce similar idea fluency and creativity.
Therefore, I hypothesize:
Hypothesis 1a: Concurrent priming of the concept “achievement” and other
pictures rated high in arousal and positive valence will create a similar idea
fluency during an EBS session.
Hypothesis 1b: Concurrent priming of the concept “achievement” and other
pictures rated high in arousal and positive valence will create a similar idea
creativity during an EBS session.
5.2.1. Achievement priming and positive priming over time
In addition to producing similar idea fluency and idea creativity, the time course
of the priming is expected to be no different in achievement priming versus priming with
85

positive images. No research has established a difference in length of the priming effect
when activating semantic networks as compared to activating a generally positive mood
state. Since this priming is delivered in a similar manner to Study 2, the priming effect is
expected to be more pronounced in both achievement and positive picture priming
towards the end of the ideation session. However, the fluency of ideas will be similar
between the two treatments.
Hypothesis 2a: Concurrent priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
similar idea generation as priming positive priming during the first half of an
EBS session.
Hypothesis 2b: Concurrent priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
similar idea fluency than positive priming during the last half of an EBS session.
The number of ideas that are highly creative also are expected to be similar in the
achievement and positive valence, high arousal priming condition. Both priming
conditions will affect ideation later in the concurrent priming session. However, the
number of ideas rated highly creative will be similar in the achievement and positive
priming conditions. Thus,
Hypothesis 3a: Concurrent priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
similar idea creativity as positive priming during the first half of an EBS session.
Hypothesis 3b: Concurrent priming of the concept of “achievement” will result in
increased idea creativity than neutral priming during the last half of an EBS
session.
5.2.2. Priming induced changes in psychophysiology
Since this study was delivered using concurrent priming, the achievement prime is
expected to activate the same semantic networks as a priori priming. Therefore, the
overall effect on cognition and emotion is expected to be similar in the achievement
priming condition. Conversely, the positive priming condition, since there is no semantic

86

thread tying the pictures together, is expected to only affect emotion. Therefore, the
positive prime is expected to alter only the emotional state of the participant not their
overall attention allocated to the task. The achievement prime is expected to have a
similar effect on cognition measured as greater alpha attenuation in the frontal cortices
after exposure to the achievement prime when compared to the positive prime. Given the
close relationship between frontal alpha-wave activity and attention, I hypothesize:
Hypothesis 4: Achievement priming, as compared to positive priming, will
increase attention during ideation in an EBS session.
As noted in study two, repeated exposure to positive pictures has shown to
increase positive valence, while repeated exposure to negative pictures has been shown to
increase negative valence (Bradley and Lang 1994; Kensinger and Schacter 2006).
Therefore, I expect both achievement priming and positive priming to be similar,
resulting in positive emotional valence. Increased positive valence can be measured by
the corrugator supercilli muscle becoming relatively more deactivated following
exposure to the prime. In addition, exposure to an achievement and positive prime is
expected to increase sympathetic nervous system activation (i.e., increased arousal),
resulting in increased skin conductance in subsequent ideation during an EBS session.
Therefore, the hypotheses for the effect of concurrent priming on emotional
psychophysiological response are:
Hypothesis 5a: Achievement priming will result in a physiological response that
indicates similar positive valence when compared to the positive prime during
ideation in an EBS session.
Hypothesis 5b: Achievement priming will result in a physiological response that
indicates similar arousal when compared to the positive prime during ideation in
an EBS session.
5.2.3. Changes in cognition and emotion over time
87

The expected time course of the psychophysiological changes in cognition and
emotion are expected to be similar to study two. Specifically, the priming effect will
manifest during the latter stages of the task. The EBS session will begin with similar
levels of attention, valence, and arousal between achievement and positive priming. As
the EBS session continues, the emotional changes in valence and arousal will be
observed, specifically there will be higher levels of positive valence and arousal during
the latter stages of the task. Levels of attention observed in the achievement priming
condition, as measured by alpha attenuation, are expected to be higher than in the positive
priming condition, since the positive prime is not expected to activate semantic networks
related to the concept of success. Therefore,
Hypothesis 6a: Achievement priming will result in higher positive valence in the
last half of an EBS session when compared to the first half of the EBS session.
Hypothesis 6b: Positive priming will result in higher positive valence in the last
half of an EBS session when compared to the first half of the EBS session.
Hypothesis 7a: Achievement priming will result in increased arousal in the last
half of an EBS session when compared to the first half of the EBS session.
Hypothesis 7b: Positive priming will result in increased arousal in the last half of
an EBS session when compared to the first half of the EBS session.
Hypothesis 8a: Achievement priming will result in similar attention, as measured
by alpha attenuation in the frontal cortices, than positive priming during ideation
in the first half of an EBS session.
Hypothesis 8b: Achievement priming will result in greater attention, as measured
by alpha attenuation in the frontal cortices, than positive priming during ideation
in the last half of an EBS session.

Study Three: Achievement versus Positive Priming Methodology
5.3.1. Participants

88

Fifty-three students were recruited from an upper-level business school course.
The course consisted of juniors and seniors, and participants completed the study for
extra credit. Demographic variables were obtained to provide average age and gender
distribution. Age ranged from 19 to 28 with the average age being 21.8 years of age.
Thirty-two participants (59.3%) were male and 22 participants were female (40.7%).
5.3.2. Tasks
The same EBS tasks were used in study two as in study one and study two. There
was one 15 minute task on generating ideas to reduce pollution and one 15 minute task on
increasing tourism.
5.3.3. Treatments
The third study was a repeated measures experiment using concurrent priming
with pictures. Each participant received two within subject treatments: achievement
priming and positive priming. Participants generated ideas using the simulator from study
one and two. Priming was delivered by pictures presented in a banner on the right side of
the screen as in study two. Participants in this treatment group generated ideas while they
were being primed. The image in the right hand banner updated to a new image every 20
seconds, and there were 30 different pictures presented in each task. The pictures were
presented in landscape format with a resolution of 400 x 300 pixels.
The achievement priming condition for concurrent priming consisted of a set of
the same set of 30 images oriented towards the concept of “achievement,” while the
positive priming condition consists of 30 images high in arousal and positive in valence
but not related to the concept of achievement. The positive priming images were selected
from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) database (Lang and Bradley
2007). They were images rated by individuals as both high in arousal and positive in
89

valence. Arousal ratings for the achievement-oriented (M = 5.14, S.D. = 0.41) images
did not differ significantly from the positive images (M = 5.30, S.D. = 0.45), (t(58) =
1.44, p = .156). Positive valence for the achievement images did not differ (M = 5.47,
S.D. = 0.61) than in the positive priming condition (M = 5.62, S.D. = .52), (t(58) = 1.03,
p = .310).
5.3.4. Dependent Variables
The dependent variables were the same as study one and two and consisted of
both behavioral and physiological measures.
5.3.4.1. Behavioral Measures
The behavioral measures were the same as Study One. Idea fluency, measured as
number of unique ideas generated, and creativity measures were collected. As in study
one and two, the creativity measures included assessment of novelty, workability, and
relevance to obtain a measure of overall creativity and total number of creative ideas.
5.3.4.2. Physiological Measures
The physiological measures were the same as study one and two and included
EEG measures, as well as, psychophysiological measures and skin conductance.
5.3.5. Control Variables
The control variables were the same as in Study one and two.
5.3.6. Procedure
The procedure of study three was similar to study two. Participants completed the
experimental procedure individually after providing informed consent approved by the
university’s Institutional Review Board. The experiment took place in an individual lab
room at a research institute. The entire research session took approximately 60 minutes.
The surveys presented in the experiment were controlled by MediaLab software (Jarvis
90

2010). The simulator software was developed using a Unity gaming shell.
Again, participants were seated in a high back chair to minimize movement. They
used a standard keyboard and mouse. The protocol began with a 10-minute series of
personality questionnaires. The experimenter then explained the procedure for attaching
the physiological electrodes and fitting the EEG apparatus, answering any questions
posed by the participant. After obtaining adequate impedance readings for the EMG and
EEG measures, the protocol continued with another brief handedness questionnaire.
The participants were randomly assigned to either the positive or achievement
priming condition. In addition, task order was counterbalanced with 27 participants
receiving the pollution task first and 30 receiving the tourism task first. Participants then
worked on the first EBS task for fifteen minutes. Next they completed a short survey to
serve as a “distractor” between treatments. Participants repeated these same steps
(priming game, idea generation) for the second priming manipulation and task. The
participants were debriefed and the session concluded.
In total, the EEG apparatus was on the participants for approximately 45 minutes,
during which the electrodes remained damp with the saline solution. Markers were
inserted into the data by the simulation software, indicating when an idea had been
entered into the chat room. This allowed for synchronization between the EBS session,
EEG and EMG systems. When the discussion simulation was completed, the
experimenter removed all physiological data collection sensors. Participants then
completed the post-experiment questionnaire. Finally, they were be debriefed, told of the
deception, asked not to inform others of the deception, and thanked for their time.
5.3.7. Manipulation Checks
Again, it was essential to ensure that participants perceived the simulator as a real
91

team discussion. All participants completed post-session questionnaires that asked if they
have noticed anything unusual about the team discussion. A variety of distractor
questions (e.g., satisfaction with discussion, perceived effectiveness) were also included
to better ensure that manipulation check question did not stand out. Participants that
recognized they were not interacting with real people were be removed from the study as
failing the manipulation check. Six of the 53 participants recognized they were not
interacting with a simulator and were removed from the analysis, leaving 47 participants
in the study. This represents a 11.3% of individuals failing the manipulation check,
which is in line with prior studies ranging to 10-15% of the subjects failing manipulation
checks (Garfield et al. 2001; Heninger et al. 2006).
Study Three: Achievement vs Generic Positive Priming Results
5.4.1. Behavioral results
The statistical analyses for the behavioral component of study one were
completed in SPSS PASW Statistics 18.0. A repeated-measures GLM was used to
examine differences between the achievement and generic positive priming conditions.
5.4.1.1. Idea fluency
Individuals did not differ in the number of ideas produced in the happy or the
achievement treatments (F(1,51) = 1.079, p = .304). The order in which the group
received priming treatments did not affect the number of unique ideas generated (F(1,51)
= 3.067, p = .086), nor did the task order for the pollution and tourism task (F(1,51) =
3.491, p = .068). Therefore, Hypothesis 1a was supported, the concurrent achievement
prime led to similar idea generation as the generic positive prime. Table 3.1 shows the
means and standard deviations of the number of unique ideas generated in the
achievement and generic positive priming conditions.
92

5.4.1.2. Idea Creativity
Individuals produced a similar number of novel ideas in both the achievement and
generic positive priming conditions (F(1,51) = 0.40, p = .530). The order in which the
participant received the priming conditions did not affect the number of novel ideas
produced (F(1,51) = 2.84, p = .098), nor did the order in which he or she received the
pollution or tourism task (F(1,51) = 2.11, p = .152).
Individuals produced a similar number of workable ideas in both the achievement
and generic positive priming conditions (F(1,51) = 0.64, p = .427). The order in which
the participant received the priming conditions did not affect the number of workable
ideas produced (F(1,51) = 1.05, p = .310), nor did task order (F(1,51) = 2.52, p = .119).
Individuals produced a similar number of relevant ideas in both the achievement
and generic positive priming conditions (F(1,51) = .46, p = .501). The order in which the
participant received the priming conditions did not affect the number of relevant ideas
produced (F(1,51) = 1.89, p = .175), nor did task order (F(1,51) = 3.21, p = .079).
The findings on novelty, workability, and relevance, taken together, provide
support for Hypothesis 1b. Achievement priming and generic positive priming produced
similar creativity of ideas. Table 3.1 shows a summary of the means and standard
deviations between the achievement and generic positive priming treatments.

5.4.2. Achievement and generic positive priming over time: Behavioral Analysis
5.4.2.1. Idea fluency and time
Individuals produced significantly more ideas in the generic positive priming
treatment compared to the achievement treatment during the first half of the EBS session
(F(1,51) = 49.13, p < .001). The effect size was small with a Cohen’s d = .11. The order
in which the participant received the priming conditions did not affect the number of
ideas produced in the first half of the EBS session (F(1,51) = 1.03, p = .315), nor did task
order (F(1,51) = 1.46, p = .233). These findings support the alternate to Hypothesis 2a,
the generic positive priming effect appears to have an influence on idea fluency during
the first half of the brainstorming session above and beyond the effect of the achievement
prime. The means, standard deviations, and results are provided in Table 3.2.
There was no significant difference in idea generation between the achievement
and generic positive priming in the last half of the EBS session (F(1,51) = 1.08, p = .305.
The order in which the participant received the priming conditions did not affect the
number of ideas produced in the last half of the EBS session (F(1,51) = 2.17, p = .147),
nor did the task order (F(1,51) = 3.61, p = .063). Therefore, Hypothesis 2b was
supported, the priming effect generated by both the achievement and generic positive
images resulted in similar idea generation in the last half of the EBS session. The means,
standard deviations, and results are provided in Table 3.3.
In addition to the tests of the hypotheses, I also compared the first half of
achievement idea fluency against the last half of achievement with a post-hoc pairwise
comparison. The number of ideas generated in the first half of an EBS session during the
achievement prime was significantly higher than the last half of ideas generated in an
94

EBS session during the achievement treatment (t(106) = 4.035, p < .001). In addition, the
number of ideas produced during the first half of the EBS session in the generic positive
priming treatment significantly differed from the number of ideas produced in the last
half of the EBS session of the generic positive priming treatment (t(106) = 3.581, p <
.001). This indicates that the concurrent achievement and generic positive prime produces
a priming effect that has more of an influence on the first half of the EBS session. Despite
the early idea generation benefit of the generic positive prime, the two treatments did not
differ in idea fluency over the entire EBS session.
5.4.2.2. Idea creativity and time
Individuals produced a greater number of novel ideas following the generic
positive priming treatment during the first half of an EBS session when compared to
achievement (F(1,51) = 170.62, p < .001). The effect size was small with Cohen’s d =
.30. The order in which the participant received the priming conditions did not affect the
number of novel ideas produced (F(1,51) = 1.13, p = .292), nor did the order in which he
or she received the pollution or tourism task (F(1,51) = .328, p = .569).
Individuals produced a greater number of workable ideas following the generic
positive prime during the first half of an EBS session when compared to achievement
(F(1,51) = 513.33, p < .001). The effect size was small with a Cohen’s d = .07. The
order in which the participant received the priming conditions did not affect the number
of workable ideas produced (F(1,51) = 2.31, p = .135), nor did task order (F(1,51) = .39,
p = .534).
Individuals produced a greater number of relevant ideas following the generic
positive prime during the first half of an EBS session when compared to achievement
(F(1,51) = 526.27, p < .001). The effect size was small with Cohen’s d = .24. The order
95

in which the participant received the priming conditions did not affect the number of
relevant ideas produced (F(1,51) = 1.89, p = .176), nor did task order (F(1,51) = .017, p =
.896). These findings support the alternate to Hypothesis 3a, indicating the concurrent
prime has an impact during the early stages of the task. The means, standard deviations,
and results are provided in Table 3.2.
Individuals produced a similar number of novel ideas during the achievement
priming treatment and the generic positive priming treatments during the last half of an
EBS session (F(1,51) = 2.87, p = .096). The order in which the participant received the
priming conditions did not affect the number of novel ideas produced (F(1,51) = 1.55, p =
.219), nor did the order in which he or she received the pollution or tourism task (F(1,51)
= .142, p = .707).
Individuals produced a similar number of workable ideas during the achievement
and generic positive priming treatment in the last half of an EBS session (F(1,51) = 0.24,
p = .628). The order in which the participant received the priming conditions did not
affect the number of workable ideas produced (F(1,51) = 2.22, p = .142), nor did task
order (F(1,51) = 2.96, p = .091).
Individuals produced a similar number of relevant ideas during the achievement
and the generic positive prime in the last half of an EBS session (F(1,51) = 1.87, p =
.178). The order in which the participant received the priming conditions did not affect
the number of relevant ideas produced (F(1,51) = 2.13, p = .150), nor did task order
(F(1,51) = 3.48, p = .068). These findings support Hypothesis 3b and indicate that the
achievement and generic positive images produce similar idea creativity in the latter
stages of the task. The means, standard deviations, and results are provided in Table 1.3.

5.4.3. Changes in Cognition
5.4.3.1. Event-related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) analysis
Similarly to the first two studies, the K-means cluster analysis produced three
neurological clusters of interest. These were selected initially according to the number of
subjects and ICs represented in each cluster and were supported by visual inspection of
the corresponding scalp maps. Due to the idiosyncratic nature of neural activity within
each participant, some individuals did not produce independent components in each
cluster. Participants which produced many muscular artifacts may have produced ICs that
were predominated by the much larger variance created by these muscle movement (and
not neural activity).
The first cluster is similar to the other right frontal clusters in study one and two.
It is more dispersed than the cluster in study two, however, is very similar to the cluster
generated in cluster one. This cluster contained data from 40 subjects and 132 ICs. This
97

cluster appears to be spread across the right frontal lobe with some dispersion to left
frontal cortex as well (See Figure 3.1). Like the previous studies, the right frontal
activation could be indicative of increased activity in creative regions of the brain.
However, these cognitive changes did not manifest in behavioral changes in idea
production.
T-tests of the achievement prime and generic positive prime are presented in
Figure 3.1, Individuals showed significant alpha attenuation (i.e., increased cognition)
(Panel 1) with the achievement prime as compared to the generic positive priming
condition (Panel 2). Panel 3 shows areas where they significantly differed. Alpha band
differences were detected between 3500ms and 2000ms before the subject entered ideas
into the chat simulator. Furthermore, these changes were evident across the alpha
frequency band (8-13Hz), showing greater cortical attention after the achievement prime
in this region when compared to the generic positive prime. This is indicative of the
subjects using more cognitive resources in the creative regions of the brain during the

98

achievement priming condition when compared to the generic positive priming condition.

Figure 3.1 ERSP of Right Frontal cluster indicating significant alpha attenuation during ideation
during the concurrent achievement prime when compared to the generic positive prime.

The second cluster is unlike the previous two studies. It is a temporal cluster,
located directly over the left temporal cortex. Left temporal cortex is where Wernicke’s
area is located, which is the primary language recognition area of the brain (Scott et al.
2000). This cluster contained data from 38 subjects and 118 ICs (See Figure 3.2). This
region is heavily involved in cognitive processing of language.
T-tests of the achievement prime and generic positive prime are presented in
Figure 3.2. Panel 3 shows no areas where they significantly differed. This finding

99

indicates that the achievement-oriented and generic positive prime did not comparatively
change cognition in the language recognition areas of the brain.

Figure 3.2 ERSP of Left Temporal cluster showing no significant differences between achievement
and generic positive priming treatments.

The third cluster is similar to the parietal cluster observed in the previous studies.
It is localized to an area posterior to the central sulcus in the parietal lobe. During the
concurrent prime, as in study two, the participants were exposed to images as well as the
chat room. These images differed between treatments with one set being related to
achievement and one set being generic positive images. The parietal lobe is responsible
for integrating sensory information and relaying it to frontal regions for further
processing. This cluster contained data from 36 subjects and 298 ICs (See Figure 3.3).
100

T-tests of the achievement prime and generic positive prime are presented in
Figure 2.3. Panel 3 shows one small area where they significantly differed. This shows
the positive images created slightly more alpha attenuation in this region than the
achievement related images. These findings indicate that overall the images in the
achievement treatment and the generic positive priming treatment did not significantly
differ in the way they were processed in the parietal lobe.

Figure 3.3 ERSP of Parietal cluster indicating similar alpha attenuation in both the achievement and
generic positive priming treatments.

5.4.3.2. Cognitive changes over time
In examining the changes in cognition due to the achievement priming effect in an
EBS session, it is important to examine the cognitive changes in ideation over time. To
101

do this, the same clusters from the full analysis were used and ideas were coded into
occurring in the first half of the EBS session or the last half of the EBS session. ERSPs
were generated for each of the clusters for the first and last half of the EBS session.
The right frontal cluster time analysis showed that no significant differences were
observed between achievement and generic positive priming during the first half of the
EBS session. A small area of significance was observed in the last half of the session
between the two achievement and generic positive priming treatments with achievement
priming showing greater alpha attenuation (i.e., increased cognitive activity). While the
images do look different in the first and last half, there likely was not enough statistical
power to uncover the differences, due to the lower amount of ideas in the both halves.
Therefore, Hypotheses 8a and 8b are not supported. The ERSPs are shown in Figure 3.4.

Figure 3.4 ERSP of Right Frontal cluster indicating no significant differences in alpha attenuation in
the first half and little significant difference in the last half of the EBS session.

The temporal cluster time analysis showed no significant differences occurred
across the alpha frequency spectrum between the achievement and generic positive
priming treatments during the first half of the EBS session. Furthermore, some significant
102

differences were observed around 2700ms to 2000ms across the alpha frequency band
with the achievement prime showing more alpha attenuation than the generic positive
priming condition in the last half of the EBS session. The ERSPs are shown in Figure 3.5.
This finding indicates that in the speech recognition region of the brain, there was only
slight differences observed in the last half of the EBS session between the achievement
and generic positive prime. The differences observed in the latter half could be a result of
individuals recognizing the common theme of “achievement” in the images, which would
likely activate semantic networks associated with the concept of achievement.

Figure 3.5 ERSP of Left Temporal cluster showing no significant differences in cognition during the
first half and subtle differences in alpha attenuation in the last half of the EBS session.

The parietal cluster time analysis showed no significant differences occurred
across the alpha frequency spectrum between the achievement and generic positive
priming treatments during the first half of the EBS session. Furthermore, no significant
differences were observed during the second half of the EBS session. The ERSPs are
shown in Figure 3.6.

103

Figure 3.6 ERSP of Parietal cluster showing no significant differences in cognition during the first
and last half of the EBS session.

These EEG results, taken together, indicate that the achievement prime
significantly affects cognition in right frontal cortex, much like the previous studies.
There were minimal significant differences observed in Wernicke’s area, indicating a
potential association of the semantic network “achievement” activated by the
achievement prime. Finally, the third cluster shows subtle significant differences over the
entire EBS session, but not when taken at the first or last half of the EBS session, likely
due to a lack of statistical power after the ideas were split.
5.4.4. Changes in Emotion
The psychophysiological measures utilized in this study were analyzed using
hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). A two-level model was created with the
psychophysiological measure at the first-level. A 20-second average of skin conductance
and corrugator activation was taken, representing 10 seconds before the subject entered
an idea and the 10 seconds after a subject entered an idea. The treatment and whether the

104

idea was in the first or second half of the chat session was included as indicators in the
HLM model. The second-level of the HLM included an indicator representing the subject
number.
For skin, the results do not indicate a main effect of achievement (b = .053, p =
.463). This indicates that the concurrent prime resulted in no different arousal between
achievement and generic positive treatments during the EBS session. Similarly,
corrugator activation, a measure of positive emotional valence, did not significantly differ
between the concurrent achievement and generic positive priming condition (b = -.238, p
= .229). Therefore Hypotheses 5a and 5b are supported, similar arousal and valence was
observed in the achievement and generic positive priming treatments. A table of means
and beta coefficients is provided in Table 3.4.

5.4.4.1. Emotional changes over time
Further investigating the route through which the achievement and generic
positive prime influence idea generation, it is important to examine differences over time
during the EBS session. HLM was used to observe these changes in emotion between
achievement and generic positive priming during ideation in the first half and the last half
of the EBS session.
For skin conductance, the measure of arousal, no main effect of time was
observed (b = -1.19, p = .234). Furthermore, the interaction of treatment and half was not
105

significant (b = 0.05, p = .627). Therefore, Hypotheses 6a and 6b are supported. For
corrugator, the measure of positive valence, no significant differences were observed in
the first or last half of the EBS session (b = -0.01, p = 0.882). Furthermore, there was no
interaction observed between treatment and first and last half of the EBS session (b = 0.095, p = 0.295). Therefore, achievement and generic positive priming did not create
changes in emotional state of the subjects in either arousal or valence during ideation in
the EBS session. Therefore, Hypotheses 7a and 7b are supported. A table of means for
the first and last half of the ideas generated in the EBS session is provided in Table 3.5.

Study Three: Discussion and Conclusion
This study examined further the impact of the “achievement” oriented prime. The
goal of this study was to examine whether a generic positive prime would have a similar
impact on idea generation and creativity as the achievement prime. Furthermore, it seeks
to establish whether the generic positive prime causes cognitive and emotional changes
that are similar to the achievement prime or if it works on cognition and emotion in some
other manner.
The behavioral findings indicate that there were no significant difference in idea
fluency or creativity associated with the achievement-oriented prime when compared to
the generic positive picture prime. However, significant changes in cognition were
106

observed for the achievement prime in the same right frontal region as studies one and
two. These findings suggest that, when compared to generic positive images,
achievement priming still impacts cognition an area of the brain related to creativity. This
finding was consistent across all three studies The generic positive prime, on the other
hand, has similar behavioral changes but, cognitively, these changes do not manifest in
the same way as the achievement prime, perhaps working through another route.
Looking deeper into the behavioral findings indicate that the generic positive
prime has significantly more ideas generated in the first half of the EBS session.
Therefore, the generic positive prime provides a more immediate payoff in increasing the
number of ideas generated in the first half of the EBS session. There is no significant
differences between the images in the last half of the EBS session, which indicates that
the achievement prime eventually takes hold. The main difference between the two sets
of priming images is the common thread of achievement in the achievement priming
condition. It is likely that it takes more time for the individual to subconsciously pick up
on this thread (requiring greater cognition), which is potentially why we see the cognitive
changes occur later in the EBS session in study two. The time analysis for cognition in
study three did not show significant differences between achievement and generic
positive images, however, it is possible that this was due in part to a lack of statistical
power, since the ERSP pictures appear to show more alpha attenuation in the
achievement condition.
The hypotheses for this study asserted that the changes induced by the
achievement prime would be through the cognitive route and the changes from the
generic positive prime would be through the emotional route. This study did not find

107

support for changes in arousal or positive valence as a result of the generic positive
prime. It is likely that the generic positive prime changes emotion or cognition in a way
that was not detected in this study. More research is needed to understand how the
generic positive prime works. For example, it is possible that a change in the overarching
mood state was not evident in down-stream psychophysiological measurements. While
there was no support to indicate that the generic positive prime occurred through the
emotional route, all three studies support that achievement-oriented priming occurs
through the cognitive route, specifically changing cognition in right prefrontal cortex,
which is an area of the brain associated with creativity. These changes result in increased
idea fluency and creativity when compared to the neutral prime but not the generic
positive prime. More research is needed to understand how the generic positive prime
influences idea fluency and creativity.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
This dissertation provides evidence that supraliminal priming creates changes in
cognition that are associated with increased idea fluency and creativity. In study one, I
found that a priori priming of achievement increased the number and quality of ideas
generated in subsequent EBS sessions. These changes were associated with changes
along the cognitive route that indicate more cognition is occurring in a region of the brain
known to be associated with creativity. Study two conceptualized and used a concurrent
achievement prime that had been integrated into the EBS tool. The concurrent prime
increases both idea fluency and creativity. Similar changes in cognition were recognized
during the concurrent prime in the EBS session. While individuals generated ideas, there
was an increase in cognition in creative centers of the brain. Study three, contrasted an
achievement oriented prime against a generic positive prime. This study showed there
108

were no overall differences in idea fluency or creativity between achievement and generic
positive priming, but did show there were differences in cognition resulting from the
achievement prime that were similar to study one and two (i.e., creative centers of the
brain were more active in achievement priming than generic positive priming).
While changes in cognition were observed across all three studies, there were no
changes in emotional state observed in any of the three studies. Emotional changes
induced by achievement priming is possible in the a priori priming condition, but these
changes would have been transient and were no longer evident once the individual was
generating ideas in the EBS session. Similarly during ideation in concurrent priming, in
studies two and three, no differences were evident during ideation. This does not preclude
changes in emotion that might have happened outside of ideation but, as in study one,
these changes were not evident during ideation.
The time course of the a priori priming effect appears to be similar to
expectations, an initial priming effect that wears off as the session progresses. However,
during concurrent priming, it appears that the impact on behavior occurs earlier than
expected, while cognitive differences are observed in the last half of the EBS session.
Taken together, the concurrent prime produces a priming effect that results in
increased idea fluency and creativity when compared to a placebo prime. In addition,
both a priori and concurrent primes result in changes in cognition in right frontal cortex.
However, the concurrent prime remains more practical for the organization because it
does not require the 5-8 minute a priori priming session before every brainstorming
session. Utilization of concurrent, achievement priming within the organization can result

109

in greater idea fluency and creativity over previous EBS systems, resulting in several
implications for research and practice.
Implications for Research
This dissertation shows that priming for achievement improves an individual’s
idea fluency and creativity in subsequent team brainstorming sessions. Furthermore, it
shows that the achievement prime can be done concurrently and integrated into the EBS
tool. The use of neurophysiological and psychophysiological tools in this study were able
to help identify the changes in cognition and emotion that correspond to the increase in
idea fluency and creativity. These tools showed that the changes in ideation as a result of
the achievement prime most closely corresponded to cognitive changes in the right
prefrontal cortex. This area of cortex has been shown to be closely linked to creativity on
generative tasks. I believe this study has a number of implications for research.
First and foremost, I believe this study opens the door for future research on how
best to design systems to enhance subconscious cognition. The findings of this study
show that our current EBS tools can be improved in such a way that enhances
performance. In this specific context, adding a banner to the EBS tool that provides
pictures of achievement improves ideation performance of an individual working in an
EBS team. However, these findings are not confined to the EBS tool. Similar research
could help uncover ways to design other collaboration systems to improve creativity or
otherwise enhance cognitive performance. This is particularly important for studies that
have shown that virtual team performance is somehow limited by individual or group
cognition (Dennis 1996; Minas et al. 2014).
Second, the concurrent priming results can further the EBS research stream by
allowing it to further explore the use of priming within the interface to enhance cognitive
110

performance of the teams. It is possible that it is “not one prime fits all,” in that other
concepts may be primed in order to increase performance that is more task specific. For
example, concepts of “mindfulness,” “attentiveness,” and “rudeness” have all been found
to affect subsequent behavior in previous studies (Bargh and Chartrand 2000). Therefore,
there might be certain EBS tasks that benefit from a prime other than the achievement or
generic positive prime. Research can delineate if there is a required fit between the prime
and the EBS task given to the virtual team by establishing a framework of EBS tasks and
matching them to a framework of EBS primes.
Third, this study contributes to the literature of individual cognition on virtual
team conveyance tasks (i.e., EBS). It shows that an individual, primed with the concept
of achievement, develops more ideas than when he/she is exposed to an achievement
prime. This further establishes the importance of individual cognition on overall idea
generation of the group. However, since this study used a simulator, it did not examine if
the individual level changes propagate out to the entire team. Previous studies have
primed all individuals within a virtual team and found that a priori priming influences
overall team ideation (Dennis et al. 2013), yet it has not examined if priming of the entire
team is necessary to develop the overall effect. If individual level changes propagate to
the entire team (as a result of one idea sparking an idea in another), then research could
further examine if priming various team members with different concepts (i.e.,
achievement, mindfulness, rudeness), results in an overall effect that is greater than any
single prime.
Research on designing systems to enhance cognition should not be limited to
collaboration. Business analytics research, for example, is focusing on how best to

111

visualize big data in a way that best enables the user to process the information (Keim et
al. 2013). Neuroimaging and psychophysiology tools utilized in this study can also be
used to uncover which visualization technique provides the greatest outcome in terms of
cognitive processing of the information. These insights can aid in the design of systems
employed in business analytics.
Similarly, the usability research stream can benefit by employing these techniques
to explore information processing and emotions resulting from different systems.
Whether the findings apply to website design or system design, insights from
neuroimaging studies can examine how cognition or emotion is changed by different
systems and how these changes relate to usability ratings by users. Once these changes
are understood, they can be leveraged to employ systems that help optimize user
productivity and satisfaction.
In the systems analysis and design literature, there is much research on cognition
in systems analysts when evaluating schema and debugging problematic code. EEG could
be utilized to better understand where the cognitive breakdowns occur for analysts.
Establishing the sources of cognitive “traps” for analysts can enable the design of
diagrams that helps alleviate the high demand on cognitive resources of analysts.
Similarly, understanding the sources of greatest cognitive effort during debugging of
code can help us further understand how to instruct analysts to approach fixing
problematic code.
In addition to these methods helping several areas of the IS field, the
neurophysiological findings in this study are interesting in their own right. First, we were
able to establish with a low-density EEG system that cognitive changes in the alpha

112

spectrum (closely tied to attention and cognitive load) occur in right frontal cortex for the
achievement prime in all three studies. This finding provides a consistent view of how
Bargh et al’s conceptualization of achievement priming affects cognition. Specifically, by
increasing the degree to which creative regions of the brain are involved during ideation.
More research is needed, however, to establish if this finding is specific to ideation or if it
affects other behaviors that have been shown to be affected by the achievement prime
(e.g., performance on high-stakes testing, performance on creativity tasks, etc). It is
possible that the consistency of these findings across the three studies might indicate that
the mechanism through which the achievement prime works in cases outside of idea
generation is also by creating greater activation of right prefrontal cortex. Overall, these
findings provide evidence that the achievement prime works by creating a cognitive
response that persists for some time then, eventually, returns to baseline.
Finally, this study helps shift the focus of collaboration literature to individual
cognition. One primary focus of collaboration research has been on virtual team
dynamics and how to facilitate communication among the team through technology.
However, only recently has attention been focused on the importance of helping facilitate
the individual to perform optimally, this improving performance of the overall team. The
findings of this study help underscore the importance of individual cognitive differences
and their ability to affect individual performance outcomes (i.e., idea generation). This
dissertation builds on Dennis et al (2013), in that it provides a source of the team
performance gains observed following a priori achievement priming, specifically that it
impacts individual cognition by increasing cognition in creative centers of the brain.
Therefore, other areas of collaboration should be further examined to see if previously

113

unexplained performance gains at the team level are a result in individual cognitive
changes. These changes could be further examined using NeuroIS to further investigate
how to best facilitate further productivity gains.
Implications for Practice
This dissertation has several implications for organizations. First, the finding that
the concurrent prime improves brainstorming similarly to a priori priming indicates that
designers of EBS technology should consider incorporating concurrent achievement
priming into their brainstorming tools. This will allow the EBS software to be utilized by
organizations to improve brainstorming results. Within the organization, managers should
consider using EBS tools with the concurrent achievement prime embedded to improve
brainstorming results of virtual teams, thereby increasing the number of ideas generated
on a problem, as well as, increasing the number of creative ideas generated in
brainstorming sessions.
Furthermore, instead of building a priori priming into organizational activities,
which requires a 5 to 10 minute priming session before the activity, managers can apply
the concurrent priming findings to areas outside of EBS. For example, corporate
presentations could include priming that is integrated into the presentation either through
the presentation slides itself, or in some other fashion. Achievement images have been
shown to increase cognition in creative regions of the brain, so for during exercises that
are part of creative processes in organizations, a concurrent prime with pictures can be
utilized to enhance the creative output of the individuals and/or teams.
Finally, there is an important implication for IT software developers. Specifically,
utilizing the tools of cognitive neuroscience, they can better understand how to create
software that ensures increased performance outcomes for their clients. The software can
114

then be marketed as designed to increase productivity through the application of
cognitive neuroscience. Only recently have corporations begun to venture into the market
of finding ways to enhance cognition (e.g., Luminosity.com). However, software
developers can create their EBS (or other) software in a way that has been shown to
enhance performance on generative tasks by increasing creative output of the groups.
This software has increased potential for gaining market share in the organizational
setting because it employs a novel software development technique.
Conclusion
The goal of this dissertation was to investigate new opportunities for IS design,
namely to begin to think about how subconscious cognition can be influenced by subtle
design interventions that improve performance. While the implications of this dissertation
are directly applicable to design of the EBS technology, future studies can examine the
use of priming in other collaboration tools (e.g., video conferencing, email, social
networking). There may also be implications for the design of other forms of technology.
The use of NeuroIS to more fully understand information processing in teams also
enhanced the collaboration literature by showing that the priming effect worked by
altering cognition, which in turn was associated with increased ideation. This can
enhance our understanding of which aspects of team interactions have the biggest “bang
for their buck” from a cognitive standpoint. Overall, these studies provide evidence for
improving EBS system design in a way that increases idea fluency and creativity. It also
provides the field with an opportunity to begin examining how to use NeuroIS to begin to
develop systems that enhance the subconscious.

APPENDIX A: PILOT STUDY SUMMARY
The pilot phase of this dissertation have been completed. The first stage of the
dissertation involved validating the images chosen for achievement were, in fact, rated as
being related to the concept of “achievement.” A group of 25 students were assigned to
computers wherein a set of 80 images were randomly presented. Forty of the images were
picked by experts as “related to achievement,” while 40 images were picked as “neutral”
and designed to have no effect. After viewing the image for 10 seconds, the students were
asked to rate the image on achievement, arousal, and valence (how positive or negative
the image made them feel). Thirty images were chosen from each set of “achievement”
and “neutral” images based on their achievement ratings. The achievement and neutral
images significantly differed on achievement (t(58) = 7.87, p < .001), arousal (t(58) =
4.71, p < .001), and valence (t(58) = 3.75, p < .001). The achievement images are
therefore significantly more related to achievement then the neutral images. Furthermore,
they provide greater excitation and are more positive than the neutral images.
The main pilot study used the validated images in a “concurrent” prime. The
images were displayed in landscape format along a banner on the right hand side of the
screen. A standard brainstorming window was provided on the rest of the screen and
participants performed an individual brainstorming task on ways to reduce pollution or
increase tourism for 15 minutes. There were two treatments. The first treatment was a
fifteen minute individual EBS with concurrent, achievement priming in the right side
banner. The second treatment was a fifteen minute individual EBS with concurrent,
neutral priming in the right side banner. Each participant received both treatments,
counterbalanced on EBS task and priming across participants. Forty-three subjects
participated in the pilot. Individuals generated significantly more ideas when exposed to
116

the concurrent, achievement prime than the neutral prime (F(1,40) = 4.77, p = .035). The
order in which the individual received priming conditions did not affect the number of
ideas produced (F(1,40) = 0.67, p = .417), nor did the task order (F(1,40) = 2.94, p =
.094). This pilot provides evidence that the concurrent prime will behave similarly to the
a priori prime in an EBS session.

APPENDIX B: EEG DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Analysis for EEG data involves a multi-step process of data cleansing and
statistical analysis. This appendix gives an overview of each step in the process. The data
analysis will follow an outline provided by Delorme and Makeig (2013) on the EEGLAB
Documentation Wiki. This analysis was previously completed in Minas et al (2014). The
figures used as examples in this appendix are taken from the data analysis I completed in
this previous study.
Data Collection Software
The data will be collected via Emotiv TestBench Software Version 1.5.0.3. This
software enables verification of impedances from the electrodes, as well as, ongoing
monitoring of data collection from each of the 14-channels throughout the EEG session.
After the EEG data has been collected, the data can be exported via the Emotiv Testbench
software from the proprietary .EDF file format to a generic .CSV format. Commaseparated value format can be imported into MatLab for analysis.
Data Analysis
The data will be analyzed using the EEGLAB v11 toolbox for MatLab. Matlab
version 2010b will be used for the analysis. EEG data in .CSV format will be imported
into MatLab and loaded into the EEGLAB toolbox for subsequent cleaning and analysis.
Step One: Individual-Level Artifact Removal
Data collected using EEG is subject to artifacts generated by muscle movements,
cardiac activity, eye blink, ambient electrical activity in the room among others. For
example, the muscle artifact is introduced because the electrical signals generated by
muscle movements in the face and scalp are much larger than those generated by neurons
in the cortex. The EEG electrodes on the scalp detect this activity, resulting in the muscle
118

artifact. Potentially the most problematic artifact is the ocular artifact (i.e., eye blink).
The ocular artifact occurs because there is a voltage differential present between the front
and back of the eye (Croft and Barry 2000). When an individual blinks the eye rotates up,
resulting in an electrical gradient change that is detected by the frontal EEG electrodes
(Croft and Barry 2000). An example of the ocular artifact is presented in Figure 1. The
artifact is apparent on lines 1-Fp1 and 1-Fp2 between 00:00:14 and 00:00:15 seconds and
again between 00:00:16 and 00:00:17 seconds. These artifacts are problematic because
they decrease the signal-to-noise ratio, obscuring results.

Figure B.1. Example of the Ocular Artifact in EEG Data.
To account for these artifacts, the data must be closely examined. In this study,
the data will be cleaned of artifacts in EEGLAB by two methods: visual inspection and
algorithm. During visual inspection, an analyst will scroll through the trials (i.e., the six
seconds prior to typing an idea in the EBS chat window) and remove trials wherein
artifacts are present. A conservative approach will be taken during visual inspection and
119

questionable or borderline trials will be removed. The next step will be to reject trials
based on automatic detection using algorithms provided within EEGLAB. These
algorithms use channel statistics to detect large deviations from baseline measurement
and mark the problematic trials for removal (Delorme and Makeig 2013). “Bad” trials are
defined as having Gaussian distributions that are beyond a chosen threshold from the
other trials. The algorithm can use probability or kurtosis to mark trials for rejection.
Probability will be used in this dissertation, and trials with voltages three standard
deviations more than baseline will be removed.
Cleaning the data by trials will remove trials with artifacts present. However,
occasionally an entire electrode will not have usable data for the entire duration of the
channel. This happens in two ways, first the electrode may not have sufficient contact
with the surface of the scalp, resulting in unreliable data from that channel. Second, the
connection of the electrode to the Emotiv system may not have a secure connection with
the device. EEGLAB provides an algorithm to detect bad channels as well, using a
similar method as the bad trial detection. Electrodes that are far away from the normal
distribution of values in the other channels will be marked for removal.
Step Two: Independent Components Analysis
The next step in data analysis is to complete an Independent Component Analysis
(ICA) of the data. Generically, an ICA is similar to a principal components analysis with
the main difference being the orthogonality constraint is relaxed during an ICA. In EEG<
an ICA changes the basis of the data from a single channel on the scalp to a so-called
virtual channel basis (Delorme and Makeig 2013). In a signal scalp channel recording,
the data is made up of the summed electrical voltages detected at the scalp in relation to a

120

reference electrode. However, after an ICA decomposition is performed, the “virtual
channel” represents a pattern of electricity present across all the electrodes on the scalp
(Delorme and Makeig 2013). Practically, this is done by assigning a weight to each
electrode that represents the level of activity present in that component. Each ICA
component represents the summation of all the electrodes multiplied by their respective
ICA weight, which produces a pattern of activation across the scalp.
The ICA decomposition produces patterns of activation that are the most
temporally independent signals available in the dataset (Delorme and Makeig 2013). In
the case of the Emotiv system, this would provide 14 distinct patterns of activation across
the scalp (i.e., one per electrode in the data set). Information sources represent activity
from one or more cortical patches (Delorme and Makeig 2013). ICA can also produce
components that represent specific artifacts, such as the ocular artifact (Delorme and
Makeig 2013). These artifacts can be removed after ICA decomposition. However, if
they have been removed prior to ICA decomposition, most components will represent
neuronal activity. ICA decompositions will be done in EEGLAB and will produce
approximately 14 components (less than 14 if electrodes were removed from analysis
during data cleansing) per participant. An example of an ICA decomposition is provided
in Figure 2. In Figure 2, one can see each component does not represent a single electrode
but, rather, a distribution of various levels of activity (indicated by hot and cold colors)
across the scalp.

121

Figure B.2: ICA decomposition for individual with
14 independent components identified
Step Three: Group Level Cluster Analysis
After the ICA weights have been obtained for each participant, a cluster analysis
is performed on the data for all subjects. The cluster analysis finds similarities among the
ICA components across subjects and groups the similar clusters together. The cluster
analysis can cluster using a k-means algorithm based upon data within each ICA
component (e.g., dipole locations, spectra, ERPs, scalp maps). The result provided in a
set of clusters that represent similar patterns of brain activity between subjects (see, for
example, Figure 3). In most cases there will also be clusters with participants that have
highly idiosyncratic brain activity. These can be identified by a low number of subjects
clustering on the identified cluster (e.g., Cls 12 in Figure 3 has only 1 subjected “1Ss”
122

with 13 independent components in the cluster “13 ICs”). Clusters that have a high
number of subjects and independent components, and are identified as neural, are
selected for further analysis (e.g., Cls 3 in Figure 3).

Figure B.3: Example from Minas et al (2014) of cluster analysis results
Step 4: Event Related Spectral Perturbation and statistical analysis of clusters
The final step in the EEG analysis is to run statistical tests on the clusters to
calculate significant differences. In these datasets, trials will be labelled as achievement
or neutral priming for significance testing. In addition, ideas will be labelled with which
time window and treatment the idea was generated (e.g., first third, achievement). Event
related spectral perturbation (ERSP) will be used to analyze frequency changes during
ideation within each cluster. ERSP is a technique that identifies event related shifts in the
power spectrum and inter-trial coherence (Makeig 1993). In ERSP, changes in log power
are calculated across a requested frequency range (e.g., alpha 8-13Hz) over a selected
time window. Large increases or decreases in power in a frequency during a certain time
123

interval indicates changes in the underlying neural activity in that frequency band.
In EEGLAB, ANOVAs can be performed on ERSPs across datasets and
conditions. The ANOVAs provide areas in which there are significant differences in a
frequency band at a specific time. The false discovery rate (FDR) can be used to correct
for multiple comparisons (Delorme and Makeig 2013). In FDR a corrected threshold is
applied to all p-values. FDR is a common correction used in neuroimaging and is
considered conservative, although not as conservative as the Bonferoni correction
(Delorme and Makeig 2013). The ERSP ANOVA provides output shown in Figure 4. In
this example, an omnibus test is completed across five conditions. The five panels on the
left indicate the log power at each frequency level across a 3 second time window. The
panel on the far right indicates the areas of significance (p < .01 with FDR) in red across
the frequency band (y-axis) and time (x-axis). The bottom picture shows a scalp map of
the cluster from which the ERSP is generated. This indicates, in hot colors, the electrodes
that most contributed to this cluster.

124

Figure B.4: ERSP and scalp map from Minas et al (2014)
Finally, after the omnibus test is completed, post-hoc pairwise comparisons can
be generated to see which conditions are significantly different. In Figure 6, the four leftmost panels are compared to the panel “Irrelevant.” Significant differences at p < .01
with FDR are shown in red every third panel. In boxes A and B, there are no significant
differences between the conditions. However, as is apparent in box C, the majority of
significant differences observed in this cluster are driven by a statistically significant
difference between the data collected during the “Norm Supp” condition and “Irrelevant”
condition. These results indicate significant differences in brain activity in the alpha
frequency band between 0 and 3 seconds after stimulus onset (time 0). More specifically,

125

the blue color in the left panel of box C is indicative of alpha attenuation (i.e., more
attention) during this condition, and these results are significantly different than the alpha
levels observed in the “Irrelevant” condition.

pictures related to achievement were chosen based on a set of themes. One picture from
each set of themes is provided below. These pictures were rated by a set of students and
were found to be significantly more related to achievement and have more positive
valence and arousal than the neutral images. Thirty images were included in the
achievement priming set of images.
