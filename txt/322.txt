This paper introduces the application of predictor-based control principles for the control of human response
to a virtual 3D face. A dynamic woman 3D face is observed in virtual reality. We use changing distance-between-eyes in a 3D face as a stimulus – control signal. Human responses to the stimulus are observed using
EEG-based excitement signals – output signal. The technique of dynamic systems identification which ensures stability and possible higher gain of the model for building a predictive input-output model of control
plant is applied. Three predictor-based control schemes with a minimum variance or a generalized minimum
variance control quality and constrained control signal magnitude and change rate are developed. High prediction accuracies and control quality are demonstrated by modelling results.
KEYWORDS: Virtual 3D Face, Human Excitement, Predictive Input-Output Model, Minimum variance and
Generalized Minimum Variance Control with Constraints.

1. Introduction
Emotions are very important to human experience
because they play an important role in human daily lives – communication, rational decision making
and learning [35], [38]. New advanced technologies
and sensors allowed to create devices, which could be
used not only in the laboratories and medical institutions [11], [33]. These devices allow to obtain EEG
signals and extract emotions in real time and could be

used in normal live situations – listening to the music
[30], playing games [13], [47], watching movies [36],
stabilizing concentration of the critical systems operators – making communication more intuitive with
human-computer interfaces [43].
This research field because of its potential and possible various applications is growing rapidly. Emotions

ling [45], recognition [44] and investigation of a feedback systems [31] are expanding. Individual emotional responses vary greatly and a single emotional model
cannot be developed for a group of people, so for this
purpose a control mechanism is necessary [10].
The most popular way to observe a human emotion in
real time is to monitor EEG-based signals as response
to stimuli (visual, audio, etc.) [11], [39]. EEG-based
emotion signals (excitement, frustration, engagement/boredom and meditation) are characterized
as reliable and quick response signals. Therefore, it

2. Control Plant
A virtual 3D face of woman was used as a stimulus for
eliciting human reaction. Three types of 3D face features (distance-between-eyes, nose width and chin
width) were used for human reaction elicitation and

is the average of observed excitement signal as
response to the testing input,

This control efficiency is reached if limited control signal change speed is higher – δt ≥ 1 (2/s). At lower signal
change speed – δt ≥ 0.6 (1.2/s), control quality of excitement signal decreases from about 67% (minimum
variance and the first scheme of generalized minimum
variance control) to about 56% for the second scheme,
when gain Kp= 0.8. The first scheme is not sensitive to
the decrease of the gain Kp and is close to the scheme of
constrained minimum variance control.

Results of control efficiency in Table 3 demonstrate
that, compared to relative measure (45) (that characterizes average absolute relative control error), the
first scheme of generalized control is not sensitive
to the decrease of the gain Kp if delta δt ≥ 0.6 (1.2/s ).
When limited signal change speed decreases (δt ≤ 0.3),
the average absolute relative control error grows and
almost does not depend on change of the gain Kp, and
all three schemes are equivalent.
Experiment results of the excitement control (Figures 9-13) demonstrated possibility to decrease
variations of the control signal using a limited signal
change speed (when constant δt of the admissible domain (12) decreases) or a generalized minimum variance control with lower gain Kp (increasing weight
factor |λ| (26) in control law (13)-(16) or weight coefficient in criterion (11) is used). Variation of the control signal in the minimum variance control scheme
is higher compared to variation in the first scheme at
the same δt values.

6. Conclusions
Experiment planning and cross correlation analysis
results demonstrated that each volunteer reacted to
the stimuli individually and response (EEG-based
excitement signal) to dynamic virtual 3D face (with
changing distance-between-eyes) can be described by
the linear dynamic model (1) with different estimates
of parameters. The numerical schemes of computing
the current estimates of parameters are based on system identification technique which ensures stability
and possible higher gain (42) of the model (1). Analysis of the results of a one-step-ahead prediction with
the first order model (4) demonstrates that excitement signal can be predicted on average with about
8% average absolute relative prediction error (43).
Accordingly, model (1) in the predictive form (4) can
be applied to the design of predictor-based control
system for stabilization of the excitement signal.
Three different schemes of the prediction-based control with constraints were developed for controlling
a human excitement signal as response to a dynamic
virtual 3D face. In these schemes, controllers design is
based on minimum variance or generalized minimum
