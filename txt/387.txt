Abstract
Learning styles are critical element in constructivism that facilitates the process of knowledge
creation. Conventional methods to evaluate the psychological trait however are exposed to
reliability issues which stem from cultural and language barriers. Hence, a new assessment
approach based on the resting EEG is proposed. The paper presents a comparative study
between EEG spectral centroid frequency and ratio features in learning style classification. A
total of 68 university students have participated in the study. Kolb’s Learning Style Inventory
has been implemented to establish the control groups. EEG is then recorded from the anterofrontal region and preprocessed for noise removal. Subsequently, the spectral centroid
frequency and amplitude features are extracted. The amplitude component is further
normalized via the ratio method. Synthetic EEG is implemented for dataset enhancement. In
general, separate investigation via k-nearest neighbor classifier has shown that the spectral
centroid frequency outperforms the amplitude ratio components. Alternatively, combination
of both features concurrently can effectively improve the overall classification performance.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Constructivism has long established itself as among the
most prominent philosophies in education. Its
principles, which is grounded in experiential learning
and learning styles proposes that knowledge is
created through a collaborative interaction between
idea and experience. Albeit receiving criticism, the
concept has been widely acknowledged due to its
success in promoting effective teaching. Through such
approach, instructors are able to provide optimal
experience by actively matching suitable teaching
methods with students’ preferred learning styles. For
the past 60 years after its initial conception, numerous
experiential learning models have been established.
These include Curry’s Onion Model, Riding and
Cheema’s Fundamental Dimensions, Dunn and Dunn’s
Learning Style Model, as well as Kolb’s Experiential
Learning Theory (ELT) [1]. Comparatively, the later has
widely established itself in educational research and
management learning [2].
Kolb’s ELT outlines that knowledge is created via
ability of individuals to absorb and comprehend
experience. The absorption dimension is formed by
dialectically-related modes of Concrete Experience
and Abstract Conceptualization. Meanwhile, the
comprehension dimension is formed by dialecticallyrelated modes of Reflective Observation and Active
Experimentation. The theory also highlights that
knowledge is formed through a process involving
creative interaction between the learning dimensions
that are responsive to contextual demands. As shown
in Figure 1, the learning process is portrayed as a
recursive cycle in which individuals will experience,
reflect, reason and act [3].

Figure 1 The experiential learning cycle [2]

Unique individual preferences to resolve the
conflicting learning modes result in varying learning
style inclinations [3]. These are mainly attributed to
past experiences, educational specializations, context
and gender [4]. Thus, as individuals mature, the

construct becomes a stable trait of personality [5].
Learning styles are assessable conventionally via Kolb’s
Learning Style Inventory (LSI). Essentially, the technique
ascertains the prevalent modes from the absorption
and comprehension dimension and classifies the
individuals into Diverging, Assimilating, Converging and
Accommodating styles [3].
Studies have revealed that gender presents a
substantial influence on the absorption dimension, but
is not significant in the comprehension dimension [4].
These are attributed to the topological differences in
brain’s functional network; which are evident in the
asymmetry of white matter connectivity [6]. Such
finding relates well to the variations in local and long
range coding of information, as well as in the
excitability dynamics of the cortical arrangements.
Hence, these affect individuals in terms of cognition
and behavior [7]. Findings have also shown that
baseline conditions are active states, while pattern of
brain activation and deactivation results as a shift of
balance from focus of the internal state to the external
environment. Thus, even without an explicit stimulus to
drive the brain, characterization of network dynamics
is still feasible [8]. Other studies have revealed that
structural configuration and functional connectivity of
the brain fully develops during adolescences. Albeit no
substantial differences in the electroencephalogram
(EEG) of adolescence and adults, subtle spectral
variations have been observed [9].
EEG is a non-invasive electrical recording of
cerebral activity. The physiological signal has been
extensively studied to unravel the underlying processes
in the brain [10]. These include characterization of
pathological conditions such autism [11], bipolar
disorders, schizophrenia [12], and epilepsies [13]. The
technique is also widely implemented in biobehavioral
studies; encompassing intelligence, cognition and
development, as well as emotional function and
dysfunction [14]. Findings have established the frontal
region as being involved with cognitive processes [15].
Studies have also revealed that the left hemisphere
specializes in logical and sequential processes, while
the right side is associated with social interaction
capabilities and emotion [16].
In essence, the EEG comprises of delta (0.5 Hz – 4
Hz), theta (4 Hz – 8 Hz), alpha (8 Hz – 13 Hz) and beta
(13 Hz – 30 Hz) waves [11]. Each of these frequency
bands hold exclusive information that can be related
to different neurophysiological processes [10]. Delta
and theta waves are each associated with deep and
light sleep [17]. Meanwhile, alpha rhythms are
apparent when the brain is in resting but conscious
state. As the brain engages in intense mental activity,
the alpha waves are replaced by the faster beta
rhythms [10]. Studies focusing on cognitive processes
have revealed that theta band contributes to working
memory demands [18]. Moreover, it was also
discovered that theta and lower alpha band is
associated with attentional requirements that prevail
during encoding of new information. Meanwhile, the
upper alpha band is inherently dominant in semantic
information processing [19].

By implementing innovative signal processing
techniques, the spectral information for each of the
frequency bands can then be quantified. The spectral
features can be evaluated via parametric or nonparametric methods. Essentially, the parametric
technique relies on estimation of model-based power
spectrum via auto-regressive, moving average or
auto-regressive
moving
average
approaches.
Meanwhile, non-parametric method includes Welch’s
technique for estimating power spectrum from time
series. Even with its inherent limitations, the nonparametric approach has been widely implemented
in numerous EEG studies [20]. For analysis purposes, the
spectral information is usually computed into
quantifiable features such as band power [19].
Spectral centroid is defined as the center of gravity
for the spectrum of each frequency bands. The
feature is practical due to its reduced computational
requirement and robustness against white Gaussian
noise [21]. In addition, the feature which can be
segregated into its frequency and amplitude
components provide an accurate description
regarding the spectral behavior [22]. Its successful
implementation ranges from intelligence assessment
[23],
speech
recognition
[21],
and
stress
characterization [24]. Thus, being comparatively new,
the spectral centroid features can also be used to
characterize learning styles from the resting EEG [25].
Machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest
neighbor (kNN) have been increasingly utilized to
classify brain signatures. In kNN, the features are
classified based on polling measures. During training,
the closest neighboring features are considered. The
testing phase then, assigns the set of features
according to class of majority. Several distance
metrics have been established, with the Euclidean
being among the commonly implemented. To date,
kNN has been widely applied in various biomedical
studies such as disease detections [26] and
rehabilitation [27].
Currently, conventional technique for assessment
of learning style involves the use of questionnaires. The
approach however, is subject to inconsistency issues
that are attributed to cultural and language barriers
[4]. To eliminate such limitations, a new method for
assessing learning styles has previously been proposed
via the EEG spectral centroid frequency (SCF) features.
Albeit yielding excellent performance [25], the impact
of spectral centroid amplitude (SCA) as the second
derivative component has yet to be observed.
Hence, this paper proposes a comparative study
on the implementation of EEG spectral centroid
frequency and amplitude features in learning style
classification. The study focuses on a group of healthy
young adults. Such age range has been included as a
control criterion to ensure that the brain structure of
subjects under study is sufficiently matured and not in
ageing state. In adolescents, the brain still experiences
neuronal maturation via synaptic pruning and
myelination [28]. Such phenomenon may indirectly
affect EEG readings and influence the findings of the
study [9]. Similarly, old aged group is not included to

minimize impact of cognitive decline which affects
attention, memory and executive functioning [29].
Past studies have shown that handedness can be
correlated with white matter anisotropy of the frontal
region [6]. Hence, to control the brain structure
variation, only right-handed subjects have been
considered. The approach has been a standard
practice; particular in psychological researches that
specializes into cognition and intelligence [30-32]. The
study is also restricted to the alpha and theta bands as
the intrinsic characteristics relating to variations in
attentional requirements and working memory
organizations exists at these frequency ranges. kNN
with k-fold cross-validation is implemented to assess
the reliability of spectral centroids as stable EEG
signatures.

2.0 METHODS
This section describes on the methods employed
throughout the entire study. It encompasses EEG
acquisition and data clustering technique, signal preprocessing and extraction of spectral centroid
features, removal of outliers and pattern observation,
implementation of synthetic EEG, classification via
kNN, as well as performance comparison between the
SCF and SCA features. An extended investigation is
also provided using a combination of both feature
components for classification. It is important to note
however, that the methods used for analysis of alpha
and theta SCF features have been replicated from
previous publication [25].
2.1 EEG Acquisition and Data Clustering
A total of 68 undergraduate and postgraduate
students (male, right-handed, mean age / standard
deviation = 23.9 / 3.1 years, age range = 18 – 37 years)
from various disciplines have participated in the study.
Matters pertaining to experimental protocol and
recording procedure have been approved by the
university’s research ethics committee (600-RMI
(5/1/6)). Prior to EEG recording, subjects were initially
briefed on the overall experimental procedure and
have given written consent.
Subjects were required to relax in seated position
with both eyes closed. EEG is then recorded from scalp
locations AF3 and AF4 via the Emotiv neuroheadset.
Sampling rate of the device is 128 Hz. A feedback loop
was completed via scalp locations P3 and P4. The
positions comply with the International 10-20 System for
electrode placement. Resting EEG was recorded once
from each subject for duration of three minutes. For
data clustering purposes, subjects were needed to
answer the Kolb’s LSI online [3].
2.2 EEG Pre-processing and Feature Extraction
The acquired EEG was pre-processed offline using
MATLAB 2012a. Rectification of baseline was
performed via 0.5 Hz high-pass filter. Electrooculogram

(EOG) artifact is then performed via automatic
rejection of amplitudes exceeding ±100 μV [33].
Normalization of signal duration was achieved by
considering 2 minutes 30 seconds EEG segment prior to
further analysis [9]. Next, the signals were filtered into
alpha and theta waves via equiripple band-pass filter
[34].
Power spectral density for alpha and theta bands
were then estimated via Welch method using
Hamming window with 50% overlapping epochs. As
mathematically shown in (1), the SCF for each band is
computed as the mean of amplitude weighted
frequencies divided by the total amplitude. i
represents the respective frequency band, N is the
number of frequency bins and S[f]wi[f] is the power of
the spectral distribution in relation to frequency, f at
bin i [21].

i 1 Sf wi f 

of this study, an SNR of 30 dB has been implemented
[35].
Via such technique, the noise array, Vnoise, is
obtained as the product of white Gaussian noise,
Wnoise, and noise voltage, Vattn; in which Vattn represents
the attenuated voltage resulting from the SNR
relationship. Hence, as expressed in (5), Vattn is then
derived as the square root of the noise power, where
Psignal is the mean power of the original signal, VEEG.

Subsequently, the synthetic version of the signal,
Vsynt, was obtained by adding Vnoise to VEEG. The
procedure can be mathematically expressed by (6)
and (7).

Meanwhile, as expressed in (2), SCA is also
obtained as the total of amplitude weighted
frequencies, but is divided by the total frequency in
the respective bands [22].

Normalization of SCA is performed using the ratio
technique; in which the inter-relationship between
alpha and theta amplitude components is being
considered [35]. The alpha and theta amplitude ratio
can each be computed via (3) and (4), where α and
θ represents alpha and theta SCA, respectively.

Both the SCF and amplitude ratio features were
then clustered into the Accommodator, Diverger,
Assimilator and Converger groups. Patterns of the
feature distribution were then observed via SPSS 19.
2.3 Generation of Synthetic EEG
Studies have shown that performance of kNN classifier
declines with uneven sample size between the control
group and small class separation [36]. To overcome
such limitation, implementation of synthetic EEG is
proposed. EEG is inherently stochastic. Thus, its
synthetic form can be produced by adding white
Gaussian noise with adequately controlled signal-tonoise ratio (SNR). Such requirement is essential to
maintain similar signal characteristics. For the purpose

(7)

A more comprehensive elaboration on generation
of synthetic EEG has been previously reported
elsewhere [35]. Prior to kNN classification, the synthetic
EEG has been used to increase the number of samples
to 40 per group and thus, totaling up to 160 samples
[37].
2.4 k-Nearest Neighbor and k-Fold Cross-Validation
kNN is a supervised machine learning classifier. The
technique adopts a statistical approach in which
unlabelled features are identified based rule of
majority. During training, the classifier stores the
spectral centroid features with its corresponding
learning style labels. Subsequently, the unlabelled
features from the testing dataset will be classified by
assigning the most frequent learning style label with k
nearest training samples. In this study, the classification
tasks were performed for k=1 to k=5 with Euclidean as
the distance metric. The train-to-test split ratio for the
dataset was set at 80:20 [38].
So as to gauge the classification performance
during training and testing, indices such as accuracy
(Acc), positive predictivity (Pp) and sensitivity (Se)
have been utilized. The performance indicators can
each be expressed by (8), (9) and (10), where TP, TN,
FP and FN represent the true positives, true negatives,
false positives and false negatives in classification.

(10)

k-fold cross-validation is incorporated with the kNN
to assess its true performance. Prior to feature
classification, the method forms a disjointed training
and testing datasets via random sampling technique.
The cross-validation estimate of accuracy is the total
amount of correct classification, divided by the
number of folds in the dataset. Thus, a feature is
deemed reliable stable for a particular dataset and a
set of perturbations, if similar prediction is being
induced with different perturbed datasets [39].
In this study, the fold value, k has been set to 5. The
data is randomly divided into five segments, in which
four segments are allocated for training, while the
remaining segment is used for testing. Hence, these
matches the train-to-test split ratio that is implemented
in the kNN. With varying k, different combination of
segments will form the training and testing datasets.
Hence, the classifier will be trained and tested for five
instances and averaged to obtain its true
performance.
In an attempt to compare the effectiveness of
spectral centroid features in classifying learning styles,
the kNN classifier will be trained and tested separately
using SCF and amplitude ratio components.
Additionally, an extended investigation is also
conducted using combination of both the feature
components.

Meanwhile, Figure 3 shows the pattern of mean
alpha and theta ratio with 95% confidence interval for
the respective learning style groups. As examined from
Figure 3(a), the Assimilators attained the highest alpha
ratio and hence, indicating that its brain state is the
most relaxed compared to the other groups. This is
followed by the Convergers and then, the Diverger
group. The Accommodators attained the lowest alpha
ratio. Figure 3(b) shows an inversed theta relationship
to that of the alpha ratio. These complement the
findings on theta SCF; in which the variations in
normalized theta content are credited to the different
strategies in maintenance of working memory.

3.0 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Initially, the patterns of SCF and amplitude ratio
features with synthetic EEG are elaborated. This is
followed by classification of SCF, followed separately
by the ratio features via kNN. An extended
investigation on combination of both features for
classification is also discussed.

3.1 EEG Acquisition and Data Clustering
Subjects were clustered into the respective learning
style groups based on the results from Kolb’s LSI. 14
subjects have been identified as Accommodators, 20
subjects as Divergers, 20 subjects as Assimilators, and
the remaining 14 subjects as Convergers. Two extreme
outliers, each from Accommodator and Assimilator
group has been identified and removed. Table 1

Initial observation on the implementation of
synthetic EEG revealed that the pattern of SCF and
amplitude ratio features are similar between the
original (N=66) and enhanced (N=160) datasets.
Thenceforth, the ensuing discussion will focus on
dataset with the synthetic EEG. Figure 2 shows the

however, decrease with increasing k. As k increases,
disturbance from other neighboring but differently
labeled features would be introduced and thus,
influencing the performance. It was also observed that
at each k, classification during testing yielded lower
accuracy than with the training dataset. This is
influenced by the smaller sample size being used for
testing.

Visually, a high degree overlapping between the
learning style groups has been observed for SCF and
amplitude ratio features. However, a remarkably good
separation with the least of distribution overlap has
been observed for alpha SCF and ratio features,
particularly for the Accommodator group.
3.2 Classification – Alpha and Theta SCF
kNN classification were initially performed separately
for SCF and amplitude ratio features. Figure 4 shows
the replicated five-fold average training and testing
accuracies for alpha and theta SCF. In theory, k=1
represents classification of similarly labelled features for
the nearest neighboring distance. Hence, this would
produce optimal results with minimal disturbance from
other differently labelled features. As the distance
increases, probability of disturbance will also increase.
This will be reflected in reduced classification
performance. However, should similar performance be
recorded with the increasing distance, this would
indicate that the feature has a high degree of
separation between the control groups. Hence, in this
study, the optimal performance is selected based on
the highest accuracy at the largest value of k.
The best result for classification of alpha and theta
SCF features was attained at k=2, with 100% accuracy
for training and 97.5% for testing. The accuracies

Subsequently, Table 2 shows the replicated results
for positive predictivity and sensitivity for each learning
style group at k=2. The classifier yielded perfect results
for all learning styles during training. During testing
however, only the Accommodators attained perfect
positive predictivity and sensitivity. This is due to
excellent class separation via alpha SCF feature.
Meanwhile, the Diverger, Assimilator and Converger
groups attained relatively lower results due to the
higher overlapping of features for both alpha and
theta SCF.

3.3 Classification – Alpha and Theta Ratio
Separately, the performance of alpha and theta
amplitude ratio features is initially assessed via the fivefold average accuracy. As shown in Figure 5, the best
result was obtained at k=2, with training and testing
each yielding 100% and 88.8% accuracy.

measures has further shown that the class separation is
much inferior for the amplitude ratio features.

3.4 Extended Investigation – SCF and Amplitude Ratio

90

The experiments conducted thus far, have provided
valuable insights on the SCF and amplitude ratio
features as reliable EEG signatures. By comparing the
classifier performance at k=2, SCF has surpassed the
amplitude ratio features, particularly in terms of
classification accuracy, positive predictivity and
sensitivity. In an effort to further increase the
classification performance, a combination of both
features is also investigated. Hence, by employing
similar methodology, the resultant five-fold average
accuracy during training and testing are as provided
in Figure 6. The best classification performance has
been obtained at k=2, with 100% accuracy for both
training and testing. Further inspection into the larger
neighboring distance of k=3 to k=5 has also revealed
improvement over the preceding experiments.

Similar pattern in classification performance has
been observed as those of the SCF features; whereby
the accuracy deteriorates with increasing k. It was also
observed that for each k, the testing phase yielded
inferior results compared with classification during
training.
Meanwhile, Table 3 summarizes the positive
predictivity and sensitivity for each learning style group
at k=2. Overall, the five-fold average indices in training
have attained perfect results. During testing however,
Divergers, Assimilators and Convergers have yielded
inferior results for positive predictivity and sensitivity.
Despite the poor performance, the Accommodator
group was able to retain 100% result for both indices. It
has been noted that the proposed amplitude ratio
features also suffers from poor class separation and
high degree of overlapping features. Such observation
is particularly true for the Diverger, Assimilator and
Converger groups.

Comparative study has revealed that the
established SCF has significantly outperformed the
proposed amplitude ratio features for classification of
learning styles. The findings were not only based on the
best classification accuracies obtained at k=2, but also
considers at larger neighboring distances of k=3 to k=5.

the
combination of SCF and amplitude ratio features has
significantly improved the classification performance.
Reliability of the results has also been ascertained via
k-fold cross-validation algorithm. The method which is
readily incorporated into the kNN classifier enables the
assessment of true performance via the selected fivefold average indices. Hence, the obtained results are
not merely obtained from single-trial experiment, but
are averaged over five sequences of randomly
assigned training and testing datasets.

4.0 CONCLUSION

[13]

In general, the study has analyzed the capabilities of
SCF and amplitude ratio features to distinguish learning
styles from the resting EEG. Comparatively, the alpha
and theta SCF have proven to be more efficient in
identifying learning styles as compared to the
amplitude ratio components. However, further study
has also shown that classification performance can be
effectively enhanced through combination of both
the SCF and amplitude ratio features.
