ABSTRACT
EEG preprocessing methods for classifying person emotions have been widely applied. However, there still
remain some parts where determining significant preprocessing method can be improved. In this regards,
this paper proposes a method to determine the most significant preprocessing methods, among them to
determine (i) denoising method; (ii) frequency bands; (iii) subjects; (iv) channels; and (v) features. The
purposes are to improve the accuracy of emotion classification based on valence and arousal emotion
model. EEG data from 34 participants will be recorded with the questionnaires (valence and arousal) that
have been taken from the participants when they receive stimuli from picture, music, and video. EEG data
will be divided into 5 seconds for each trial. Then, EEG data will be processed using denoising method and
feature extraction. After that, the most significant preprocessing methods will be chosen using statistical
analysis Pearson-Correlation. The preprocessed EEG data will be categorized. The average accuracy results
using SVM are 66.09% (valence) and 75.66% (arousal) while the average accuracy results using KNN are
82.33% (valence) and 87.32% (arousal). For comparison, the average accuracy results without choosing the
most significant preprocessing method are 52% (valence) and 49% (arousal) using SVM while the average
accuracy results using KNN are 50.13% (valence) and 56% (arousal).

INTRODUCTION

Emotions play an important role in decision
making, perception, interaction, and human
intelligence. Therefore emotions are one of the
important things in humans. Emotions can be
expressed through words, voice intonations, and
facial expressions. In HCI field, computer is
difficult to knowing exactly human emotions [1].
Previous researches proposed that emotions
recognition only focus on facial expressions and
voice intonations. However, emotions recognition
with facial expressions or voice intonations does
not showing exactly real emotions because anyone
can easily change their face expression. As well as
voice intonation, anyone can easily change their
voice intonation. Therefore further researches need
to be done, so we can know the real human
emotions.

Emotions are a physiological process which is a
process that can causing physical changes in human
body. Their changes include the change of (i) heart
rate, (ii) galvanic skin response (GSR), (iii)
electrooculogram (EOG), (iv) breathing pattern, (v)
body temperature, (vi) electromyogram (EMG), and
(vii) electroencephalogram (EEG) [2]. In this study,
we used EEG to recognize human emotions.
Currently, researches on emotions classification
using EEG data have been widely applied. Some
researcher in previous studies [2] had conducted
experiments with feature extraction using PSD and
ASM. Results of accuracy were 57.6% on valence
and 62% on arousal. Researcher in [3] had
conducted experiments with feature extraction
using ASP. Results of accuracy were 66.05% on
valence and 82.46% on arousal. Other researcher
[4] had conducted experiments using statistical
analysis to determine the most significant features
of the emotions.

ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM (EEG)

EEG is electrical recording activity on the human
scalp. EEG measures the voltage changing from
brain ions. Brainwave voltages are small which
have the main frequency up to 50 hertz. As seen in
Figure 1, there are five types of brainwaves
according to their frequency, among them (i) delta
(0.5 - 4 Hz), (ii) theta (4-8 Hz), (iii) alpha (8-13
Hz), ( iv) beta (13-40 Hz), and (v) gamma (30-50
Hz).
Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is a device for
recording EEG data. BCI records brainwave
activities during a certain time. Emotiv EPOC is
one of BCI device that we used in this study. Figure
2 shows channels placement in Emotiv EPOC.
Each channel shows position which is applied on
the human scalp.

Figure 2. Emotiv EPOC Channels

There are various methods which are applied in
this study, among them fast fourier transform (FFT)
and stationary wavelet transform (SWT). These
methods are one of denoising methods that can be
used to convert EEG data from time domain to
frequency domain [5]. Independent component
analysis (ICA) can be expected to separating EEG
data and noise [6]. In this study, we used
combination of ICA, SWT, and FFT to denoising
EEG data. Pearson-Correlation is statistical analysis
method which is used to selecting the most
significant preprocessing methods, among them to
choosing (i) denoising method, (ii) frequency
bands, (iii) subjects, (iv) channels, and (v) features.
SVM and KNN are the methods which are used in
classification. Result from this study is web-based
applications which is able to predict the emotions
of EEG data. The purpose of this study can be
utilized in various fields [7][8][9][10] [11].

There are many channels in EEG data. Each
channel is denoted by letters and numbers. Letters
indicate the area of the head. For example, F
indicates the frontal lobe (the front side of the
scalp) and T indicates the temporal lobe (the central
side of the scalp). Even numbers indicate the right
side of the scalp, while the odd numbers indicate
the left side of the scalp.
Currently, many researchers have been analyzing
EEG data. They can be used to analyzing diseases
such as (i) epilepsy, (ii) sleep disorders, and (iii)
cerebral palsy. Also can be used to analyzing brain
activity such as (i) fatigue, (ii) drowsiness, and (iii)
emotions.

different emotions expression. Valence has score
between 1 to 9. The lower of score indicates more
sad. Conversely, the higher of score indicates more
happy. Same to valence, arousal has score between
1 to 9. The lower of score indicates more calm.
Conversely, the higher of score indicates more
excited.
Figure 4. Self Assessment Manikin (SAM)

James A. Russell proposed a model of emotional
which was named circumplex emotion model [11].
As seen in Figure 3 this model categorizes human
emotions into four dimensions based on valence
and arousal, among them:
1) Class 1, High Arousal Low Valence (HALV)
Representing anger, upset, stress, and
frustrated.
2) Class 2, High Arousal High Valence (HAHV)
Representing happy, excited, and interested.
3) Class 3, Low Arousal High Valence (LAHV)
Representing relief, relaxed, and comfortable.
4) Class 4, Low Arousal Low Valence (LALV)
Representing tired, bored, and sad.
As seen in Figure 4, we use self assessment
manikin (SAM) to measuring the score of valence
and arousal [13]. SAM is a questionnaire that is
expressed in manikin form. Each score indicates

In this study, we assumed that the scores have
low category if the scores are between 1 to 4 and
have high category if the scores are between 6 to 9.
So each valence and each arousal have two classes,
among them valence with low or high scores and
arousal with low or high scores.

RESEARCH METHODS

As seen in Figure 5, there are several steps to
classifying emotions from EEG data. First, we
prepare stimuli, among them (i) pictures, (ii) music,
and (iii) videos. The stimuli are used to getting
participants emotions while recording their EEG
data. After that, we perform preprocessing EEG
data, among them (i) cutting EEG data, (ii)
denoising EEG data, and (ii) doing feature
extraction. Then, we do statistical analysis based on
extracted features of EEG data. Finally, we create
classification models which use preprocessing
methods based on statistical analysis results.
4.1. Stimuli
There are several stimuli that can be used to
getting emotion of the person, among them (i)
thinking something, (ii) remembering, (iii) seeing a
picture, (iv) listening a music, (v) smelling, (vi)
watching a video, (vii) playing a game, etc. [14].

Currently there are some researchers who published
stimuli database, among them:

purpose of the rule is to minimize the noise in EEG
data. The rules are:

1) Geneva Affective Picture Database (GAPED)
provides a database with picture stimuli [15].
2) 1000 Songs for Emotional Analysis of Music
provides a database with music stimuli [16].
3) LIRIS-ACCEDE: A Video Database for
Affective Content Analysis provides a
database with video stimuli [17].

1) When participants received music stimuli, we
asked them closed their eyes.
2) When participants received pictures stimuli,
we asked them to keep their eyes open
without blinking.
3) When participants received video stimuli, we
asked them to minimize their eyes blinking.
4) During all of the experiment, we asked
participants to minimize body movement.

In this study, (i) pictures, (ii) music, and (iii)
videos are used as stimuli to get emotion of the
person. There are 5 pictures, 5 music and 4 videos
that are used as emotions stimuli. At picture
stimuli, we took 4 pictures from Internet and a
picture from [15]. At music stimuli, we took 4
music from internet and a music from [16]. At
video stimuli, we took all of videos from Internet.
For selecting stimuli from the internet, the stimuli
are voted to 5 people from ITS students for
determining the stimuli which are most significant
to emotion (High Valence, Valence Low, High
Arousal, and Low Arousal).

After we explained the experiment rules, we
noted participants profile such as (i) age, (ii)
gender, (iii) uses of glasses, (iv) uses of contact
lenses, (v) sleep hours in the last 24 hours, and (vi)
the level of current participants valence. After that,
we put Emotiv EPOC on participants scalp until
reaching green indicator in Emotiv EPOC software.
After all of the preparation was done, EEG data
recording and experimentation will be begun.
As seen in Figure 6, the following steps are
performed during the experiment:

4.2. EEG Recording

Figure 6. EEG Recording

In this study, EEG data were taken from
participants. The greater the number of participants,
the better results obtained. We got participants from
ITS student. Total of participants that we got were
34 people, among them 20 men and 14 women
(with an average age was 20.5). The majority of
EEG data recording performed during a day with
total time for each participant was 25 minutes.
Emotiv EPOC is a device which is used to obtain
EEG data from the participants. As seen in Figure
2, there are 14 channels which are used in Emotiv
EPOC. Their channel names are AF3, AF4, F3, F4,
F7, F8, FC5, FC6, P7, P8, T7, T8, O1 and O2.
Sampling rate which is used in the device is 128
Hz.
Before performing EEG recording, we explained
the rules of experiment to the participants. The

1) The early step of the experiment is relax
period. During relax period, we asked
participant to closing their eyes for 60
seconds while listening to a relax music. The
purpose is to balancing participants emotions.
2) After that, we instruct participants to keeping
their eyes close while inform that the first
stimuli which is used is pictures. Then we
remind participants to keeping their eyes open
without blinking. After participant was ready,
we prepare picture stimuli. When the stimuli
ready to be shown, we inform participant that
in third count we will ask to opening their
eyes to focus on the stimuli and EEG data
recording will be begun. After 5 seconds, we
stopped the recording and asked participant to
telling their questionnaire (valence and
arousal) which was felt after seeing the
stimuli. Until this point, a trial EEG recording
using pictures stimuli completed. Then, the
processes will be repeated until all of picture
stimuli are displayed.
3) After all of pictures have been shown, we
instruct the participants to closing their eyes
while inform that the next stimuli which is

used is music. Then, we remind participant to
keeping their eyes close while the recording.
After participant was ready, we prepare music
stimuli. When the stimuli ready to be played,
we inform participants that in third count we
will ask to closing their eyes to focus on the
stimuli and EEG recording will be begun.
After 45 seconds, we stop the recording and
ask participant to telling their questionnaire
(valence and arousal) which was felt after
hearing the stimuli. Until this point, a trial
EEG recording using music stimuli
completed. Then, the processes will be
repeated until all of music stimuli are played.
4) After all of music have been shown, we
instruct the participants to closing their eyes
while inform that the next stimuli which is

used is video. Then, we remind participant to
keeping their eyes open and minimizing their
eyes blinking while the recording. After
participant was ready, we prepare video
stimuli. When the stimuli ready to be played,
we inform participants that in third count we
will ask to opening their eyes to focus on the
stimuli and EEG recording will be begun.
After 45 seconds, we stop the recording and
ask participant to telling their questionnaire
(valence and arousal) which was felt after
watching the stimuli. Until this point, a trial
EEG recording using video stimuli completed.
Then, the processes will be repeated until all
of videos stimuli are played.

4.3. Cutting EEG Data
In this study, a total of EEG data for each second
is 128 data. EEG recording time for each trial is 5
seconds for picture stimuli and 45 seconds for
music or video stimuli. We cut EEG data due to
differences in the length of data for each trial. As
seen in Figure 7 and Figure 8, we cut EEG data to 5
seconds (640 data) for each trial. The explanation
of the methods are:
1) As shown in Figure 7 when the total EEG
data on picture stimuli more than 640, we take
640 middle of data.
2) As shown in Figure 8 when the total EEG
data on music or video stimuli more than
3200, we take 3200 middle of data. After that,
we cut the data for every 640 data. Because of
that, each trial of EEG data with music or
video stimuli to be 5 trial of EEG data.
By using this method, the number of trials for
each subject from initially 14 trial (5 stimuli picture
+ 5 stimuli music + 4 stimuli video) becomes 50
trial (5 stimuli picture + 25 stimuli music + 20
stimuli video). There are 14 channels in each trial
and 640 EEG data in each channel.
4.4. Denoising Method
The purpose of denoising EEG data is reducing
noise in EEG. There are several denoising methods
of EEG data, such as:

E-ISSN: 1817-3195

infomax, (ii) natural gradient, and (iii) FastICA.
FastICA is one of ICA algorithm that computes
faster than the others. There are two main processes
in FastICA: preprocessing ICA and extraction
component [18]. The explanation of the
preprocessing FastICA among them:
- Centering, a process to make the average value of
each channel to zero. The implementation of this
can be seen in (3). Where x is the EEG signal
with dimension N x M, N is the number of
channels, and M is the length of data on each
channels.
- Whitening, a process for making inter-channel
are not correlated and having variance value one.
The general process for whitening EEG data is
calculating
eigenvalue
and
eigenvector.
Implementation of this can be seen in (4). Where
x is EEG signal with dimension N x M, E is
eigenvector matrix, and D is eigenvalue in
diagonal.
Extraction component is the main process in
FastICA by maximizing non-gaussian to estimate
W. The process is calculated each channel with the
number of C (number of the desired component,
where C ≤ N). The implementation of this process
can be seen in (5), (6) and (7). Where p is an index
iteration from 1 to C, g is tanh function, and g’ is 1tanh2 function. The value of Wp is initialized by
random vector with length N.
x

4.4.1. Independent component analysis
Independent Component Analysis can eliminate
noise in EEG data, among them (i) muscles
movement, (ii) heart rate, (iii) eyeball movement,
and (iv) eyes blinking [5]. ICA works by separating
data between noise and original EEG data. In this
study, ICA was performed on each trial of all the
subjects. As seen in (1), ICA transforms the data in
a linear form. Where x is a mixture of EEG data
(resulted from mixed EEG data and their noise), A
is mixing matrix, and s is the original EEG data that
containing independent component (IC). The
purpose of ICA is looking for s by estimating
matrix W which is the inverse of matrix A. Thus
the form of equation becomes as shown in (2).
Because matrix W and matrix A are unknown, the
value of matrix W needs to be estimated. ICA can
estimate the value of W by maximizing the nongaussian. Higher value of non-gaussian from W and
x, more independent the value of s. There are
various algorithms of ICA, among them (i)

4.4.3. Stationary wavelet transform
Wavelet denoising is a method to improving
performance of ICA. One of the wavelet denoising
methods is discrete wavelet transform (DWT).
However DWT has its disadvantages, among them
has longer computation time because of down
sampling process (reduction of features number in
the data). Stationary wavelet transform (SWT) is a
modification function of DWT. SWT has faster
computation because of absence of down sampling
process [19]. Same as DWT, SWT uses the
function of low pass filter and a high pass filter to
separate the EEG data into frequency band which
are different at each level of decomposition. Figure
9 shows the decomposition process using low-pass

As seen in Figure 10, in this study there are
several combination of denoising methods, among
them:
1) Fast Fourier Transform.
2) Independent Component Analysis & Fast
Fourier Transform.
3) Stationery Wavelet Transform.
4) Independent

Results of these methods are getting 5 frequency

4.5. Feature Extraction
As seen in Figure 11, feature extraction from 5
frequency bands of each denoising methods were
calculated. In this study, feature extraction methods
were used among them:
1) Minimum, the smallest value of each
frequency band.
2) Maximum, the greatest value of each
frequency band.
3) Average, the average value of each frequency
band.
4) Standard deviation, the standard deviation of
each frequency band.
5) Power, the average value from squared

4.6. Statistical Analysis
As seen in Figure 12, at this step we investigate
(i) method denoising, (ii) frequency bands, (iii)
subjects, (iv) channels, and (v) features which have
the most significant characteristics with the
questionnaire (valence and arousal). To do this, we
use Pearson-correlation method.
Pearson-Correlation can measure the linear
relationship between two random variables. There
are 2 steps to calculating Pearson-correlation,
among them find covariance value from two
variables and divide covariance result by

formula to calculate Pearson-correlation can be
seen in (9), where x and y indicate each data
between the two variables. Formula to calculate

4.7. Classification and Prediction
We use Support Vector Machine (SVM) and KNearest Neighbors (KNN) as classification
methods. The classification that we did in this study
is divided into two parts, among them classification
with valence (high valence and low valence) and
classification with arousal (high arousal and low
arousal).
To measure the accuracy of the classification, it
is necessary to train and test the data. We use K
fold cross-validation with the value K = 10 for
separating data train and data test. After the
accuracies were obtained, select classification
method that has the best accuration value to be used
at prediction emotion. The purpose of that is to
obtained predictions as accurate as possible. Figure
13 shows a diagram of classification and prediction
process where preprocessing method were obtained
from statistical analysis results.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

5.1. Find The Best Denoising Method
At this step, we were looking for correlation
values to obtain the best denoising method. The
process that we do was looking for correlations
between each denoising method and the
questionnaires (valence and arousal). After
receiving the results of the correlation, we made
absolute all of correlation value. Then count all of
correlation value that had value more or equal than
0.4. Count of the highest correlation value will be
selected for used on classification and prediction.
1) Count of correlation with valence
Figure 14 shows the results count of
correlation value between each denoising
method and valence. On the figures we can
conclude that the best denoising method for
valence was Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
So at classification and prediction, we use
FFT for denoising EEG data.
2) Count of correlation with arousal
Figure 15 shows the results count of
correlation value between each denoising
method and arousal. On the figures we can
conclude that the best denoising method for
arousal was ICA & FFT. So at classification
and prediction, we use ICA & FFT for
denoising EEG data.

Figure 13. Process of Training and Prediction EEG Data

In this study, we calculate sum of correlation
from each (i) denoising method, (ii) frequency
band, (iii) subject, (iv) channel, and (v) features that
their absolute value are greater or equal than 0.4.
The highest correlation number will be selected and
used as a classification model. Amounts of
preprocessing method that we choose are: (i) 3
frequency bands, (ii) 10 subjects, (iii) 2 features,
(iv) 1 denoising method, and (v) 20 subjects which
have highest correlation to the questionnaire
(valence and arousal).

5.2. Find The Best Channels
At this step, we were looking for correlation
values to obtain the best channels. The process that
we do was looking for correlations between each
channels and the questionnaires (valence and
arousal). After receiving the results of the
correlation, we made absolute all of correlation
value. Then count all of correlation value that had
value more or equal than 0.4. Count of the highest
correlation value will be selected for used on

F7, (iii) F4, (iv) AF3, (v) F3, (vi) O1, (vii) T8,
(viii) P8, (ix) O2, and (x) FC5. So, we use the
channels at classification and prediction.
5.3. Find The Best Features
At this step, we were looking for correlation
values to obtain the best features. The process that
we do was looking for correlations between each
features and the questionnaires (valence and
arousal). After receiving the results of the
correlation, we made absolute all of correlation
value. Then count all of correlation value that had
value more or equal than 0.4. Count of the highest
correlation value will be selected for used on
classification and prediction.
1) Count of correlation with valence
Figure 18 shows the results count of
correlation value between each features and
valence. On the figures we can conclude that
the best features for valence Mean and Power.
So at classification and prediction, we use
Mean and Power for used as features.

5.4. Find The Best Frequency Bands
At this step, we were looking for correlation
values to obtain the best frequency bands. The
process that we do was looking for correlations
between each frequency bands and the
questionnaires (valence and arousal). After
receiving the results of the correlation, we made
absolute all of correlation value. Then count all of
correlation value that had value more or equal than

5.6. Find Accuracy
At this step, we calculated accuration value for
each classification methods (SVM and KNN).
Preprocessing methods which are used in this step
were resulted from statistical analysis. Following
are the results of classification:

1) Count of correlation with valence
Figure 20 shows the results count of
correlation value between each frequency
bands and valence. On the figures we can
conclude that the best frequency bands for
valence was Theta, Beta, and Gamma. So, we
use the frequency bands at classification and
prediction.
2) Count of correlation with arousal
Figure 21 shows the results count of
correlation value between each frequency
bands and arousal. On the figures we can
conclude that the best frequency bands for
arousal was Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. So, we
use the frequency bands at classification and
prediction.
5.5. Find The Best Subjects
At this step, we were looking for correlation
values to obtain the best subjects. The process that
we do was looking for correlations between each
subjects and the questionnaires (valence and

In this study, we created web-based application
that can simplify the process of emotional
prediction from EEG data as shown in Figure 24. In
addition we also make other features, among them
emotion prediction of EEG data and classification
of each different method. Figure 25 shows the
display for input process on emotion prediction,
among them the input EEG file path, preprocessing
methods, and classification. After input the data,
the system displays the results of prediction of
emotion as seen in Figure 26. In the display we can
see that the example of his emotions prediction is
low valence and low arousal. So the results are
getting class 4 (LALV), which represents the
feeling of tired, bored and sad.
