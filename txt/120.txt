ABSTRACT
We have previously shown that the complexity of human brain activity and
the emergence and strength of alpha oscillation as measured by EEG scale
dramatically with access to the features of modernization. Here we show that
these features of the EEG, while correlated to one another are distinct in their
origin and that while complexity is most strongly related to travel or geofootprint,
energy of the alpha oscillation scales more systematically with fuel consumption.
Finally, composite EEG scores representing the dominant principal component
scale in remarkable lockstep with the dominant component of the features of
modernization. This demonstrates that human brain dynamics, and therefore
cognitive outcome, are profoundly and systematically tied to the context of life
experience. Indeed the implication is that ‘normal’ brain function is not absolute
and can only be considered in relation to or conditional on the context in which
it is embedded.

INTRODUCTION
The core of modernization involves technologies and social structures that extend and expand the
rate and scope of human interaction and experience. These include agglomeration into dense urban
structures, expanded formal education systems and significant technologies such as electricity,
telecommunications and motorized transport. Modernization has also brought with it a growing
income inequality that results in substantially different levels of access to modern experience.
Given that the human brain is an experience dependent organ that continually reconfigures itself in
response to stimulus [1-4], such wide differences in experience along these dimensions have a dramatic
impact on fundamental aspects of brain dynamics. A host of studies have shown that lower income
and education are associated with structural differences in the brain [5-11] and that environmental
enrichment in animal studies is associated with a vast array of cellular and molecular changes [12-17].
Further, we have shown in two companion papers that populations with access to higher levels of
modernity have significantly higher complexity of the EEG signal [18] as well as dramatically stronger
presence of alpha oscillations [19]. Here we present a detailed analysis of the relationship between
the features of the alpha oscillation and complexity, and in turn, their relationship individually and in
composite with various individual factors of modern context as well as their principal components.

Our sample comprised 402 adults between the ages of 21 and 65 from 48 locations in India including
remote settlements of just 300 people with no electricity or motorized transport, to cities of several
million people with all modern amenities, and spanned a range of annual incomes from $300 to
approximately $150,000 dollars, translating to daily incomes of $0.82 to ~$410. Correspondingly

with the highest R2 value. We next computed the significance of
an ANOVA (pANOVA), which would provide the probability of a
difference across the various bins. To determine the likelihood of
such a trend appearing that could not be accounted for by intraperson fluctuations, we also computed the probability of finding a
similar trend from shuffling the CT values across the participants
1000 times including: (i) the probability of obtaining a significant
ANOVA in the shuffled iterations that was ≤ 0.05 (pshuff1) or (ii) ≤
the p-value of the data (pshuff2) and (iii) the probability of finding a
shuffled iteration with a trend that was positively correlated with
p<0.05 to the data (pshuff3).

our sample spanned a spectrum from people living in premodern conditions with no formal education, phones, motorized
vehicle or electricity to others who were college educated, digitally
connected and internationally traveled. Our measures include the
population of the place of residence, income, education, the farthest
distance traveled from home (travel or geofootprint) and monthly
expenditure on telecommunication, vehicle fuel and electricity (see
Table 1 in [18]). Each of these factors represent structures or tools
that expand access to interactions and experiences and therefore are
proxies for the rate and breadth of exposure of the brain to stimuli.
Here we explore the relationships of each of the EEG features to one
another and to individual and composites of each of the contextual
features that describe the various components of modern
civilization. Our results show that each EEG feature is distinct and
has highly significant relationships with many of the contextual
features with differing patterns. Finally we show that composite
scores of EEG activity derived from principal components of the set
of EEG features move in remarkable lockstep with composite scores
of modern experience derived from principal components of the
set of contextual features demonstrating a very clear relationship
between brain dynamics and life context.

RESULTS
Relationships among EEG Features
Here we look at the relationship among the three EEG features
to determine how they are related. It is possible that the various
features of the EEG signal are different aspects of a common
underlying influencer and therefore strongly correlated. On the
other hand given that an oscillation is a repetitive structure and
complexity is a measure of diversity, a strong alpha oscillation (i.e.
with high energy Eα and high peak frequency Pα) would reduce
the complexity of the structure and may therefore be negatively
correlated with complexity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sampling, Survey and EEG Recording

Fig. 1A shows a scatter plot of CT vs. Pα for all participants in our
study along with the mean CT ±SEM (in black) for the population
in 0.5 Hz bins of Pα . Contrary to the expectation, mean CT
increased systematically with Pα (R2 of a linear fit of the population
means was 0.61 with slope = 1.78). However the overall correlation
between Pα and CT was positive but very low (r =0.2). Indeed
individuals had a broad spread of CT values for each value of Pα
and a participant with no detectable oscillation could have a CT
value spanning the entire range of possibilities from 35 to 90. The
structure of this relationship indicates that these two features are
likely to be independent in their origin though may be influenced
by some common drivers.

The survey methodology and sampling were carried out as
described in a companion paper [18]. Briefly, participants
answered a series of questions regarding their demographic,
communication and mobility behavior in addition to having EEG
recorded for three minutes when they were seated with their eyes
closed. All participants were explained the purpose and protocol
of the experiment and signed an informed consent. The EEG
recordings were carried out using the Emotiv EPOC device, after
comparison to the clinical grade Neuroscan device for similarity of
results, again as described in [18].

Principal Component Analysis

We next looked at the relationship between CT and Eα (Fig. 1B).
Here again the correlation of the two features across all participants
was positive but weak (r = 0.43). People with very low values of
Eα reflecting the absence of an oscillation, had CT values spanning
the entire range. However unlike the case of Pα , while the range of
CT values was higher for those who did have the oscillation (and
therefore Eα values above 40), the population means did not change
substantially as Eα increased beyond this level (R2 of linear fit = 0.33,
Slope = 0.01) indicating, again, distinct origins and influencers of
complexity and the features of the alpha oscillation.

Principal Component Analysis was done using the FactomineR
PCA function. Prior to application of the PCA function, all records
without values in any one of the columns were removed from the
analysis (121/402 records). Prior to performing the PCA all data
components with highly skewed distributions approximating
lognormal were log transformed with log base 5 to create linear
relationships among the variables. This included Income, Fuel
Spend, Phone Spend, Electricity Spend and Population among the
contextual variables, and Eα from the EEG features. The circle of
correlations shown represent the unit scaled coordinates of the
components. The component scores for the EEG and context of
each individual were calculated as the sum of the contribution of
each element multiplied by the unscaled individual element.

Finally we note that the two features of the alpha oscillation, Pα
and Eα are also only very weakly correlated (r= 0.09, Fig. 1C) and
therefore represent two distinct features of the oscillation. Indeed
while Pα is distributed normally, Eα has a substantially different
long tailed distribution demonstrating distinct structures and
origins. This relationship is shown in our previous paper (Fig. 3E;
Alpha Energy). Mean Eα had a U-shaped relationship to Pα with
the highest values at ~11 Hz in the middle of the alpha range. This
U-shape could not be accounted for by a boundary effect of the
range suggesting that there may be an optimal Pα.

Statistical Significance of Trends
All trends are shown as population means ±SEM for each bin
along the ordinate axis thereby depicting a trend of the shift in
the population distribution. We calculated various statistics to
determine the significance of these trends. First we calculated
the R2 of logarithmic, exponential and linear fits, reporting the fit

navigating new spatial layouts, languages and cultures.
Going forward, along with the individual EEG features we describe
the relationships of the scores for each of the first two principal
components of the EEG features to the scores for each of first two
components of the contextual factors.

We next performed principal component analysis to identify
orthogonal components among both the EEG features (Fig. 2A,B)
and the contextual factors (Fig. 2C,D) of the participants. Contextual
factors refer to the life factors such as education, technology use and
others that we have captured; essentially the context in which the
participant lives.

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN EEG
FEATURES AND CONTEXT FACTORS

The first component of the EEG features explained ~55% of the
variance in the sample and represents the correlation of all three
features. The second component explained ~30% of the variance
and the third component the remaining 14%. The contribution of
the factors within the first principal component relative to the second
is shown as a vector (circle of correlations) with one component
represented on each of the x- and y-axes. Fig. 2A shows the second
component of the EEG features (EEG Comp 2) versus the first (EEG
Comp 1), and 2B shows the third component (EEG Comp 3) versus
the first. These demonstrate that the second component largely
represents the residual dominance of Pα and the third component
the residual variance of Eα.

Here we compared 6 aspects of the EEG signal (EEG features CT,
Pα, Eα, weighted Pα and composite principal component scores EEG
Comp1 and Comp2) to 14 contextual or behavioral factors and
components (11 features of modernization, Pattern Test Score and
the first two principal components of the context factors Comps 1
and 2). Given that this results in 6x14 or 84 comparisons, we present
in the main paper only an overview of the strength and significance
of all the relationships (R2, significance of an ANOVA PANOVA;
Figs. 3,4) as well as some of the most significant and interesting
relationships (Fig.5,6). However, details of all the relationships for
each of 8 context factors are shown in 9 supplementary figures.
To compute the R2 and PANOVA we performed an analysis of the
trend with which the population means of the EEG feature or
component score shifts as a function of an individual context
factor or component score. The bin sizes for the context factors
were determined such that the first and last bins (with lowest and
highest value), where the number of participants was typically
fewer, had at least 5 data points. We then fit trend lines through
the means and calculated the R2 for the function with the best fit.
Typically the functions of best fit were either linear or logarithmic,
although some exponential and sigmoidal relationships were found.
We then performed an ANOVA for the groupings, calculating the
p-value (PANOVA). The R2 and PANOVA together provide views of the
magnitude and significance of the trend. We also computed various
probabilities of positive trends and PANOVA values for shuffled
datasets (see methods). All statistics for the 25 most significant
relationships are shown in Table 1. The comprehensive statistics for
all 84 comparisons are in Supplementary Table 1.

In the case of contextual factors, the PCA was performed using
8 factors. While all factors were positively correlated, we have
previously shown that income, education and phone spend were
most tightly correlated (Fig. 4A in [18]) while travel or geofootprint
was least correlated to the other factors. Correspondingly, the first
principal component (Context Comp 1) accounted for 47.54%
of the variance where all factors of experience were essentially
positively correlated with income, while the second component
(Context Comp 2) contributed 14.24% of the variance and was
dominated by travel (Geofootprint) (Fig. 2C). The third component
(Context Comp 3), shown here versus the second component, was
dominated by the residual variance of expenditure on vehicle fuel
and accounted for only ~9% of the variance (Fig. 2D). We note
that fuel expenditure is a proxy for more local activity and also the
speed with which the environment might be experienced, while
geofootprint represents exploration of new environments including

R2 values for the function that best fit the relationship
between each individual EEG Feature or composite
Component (columns) and each individual Context

similarity of CT and EEG Comp 1 these are placed next
to one another and values sorted in descending order by
the average R2 of CT, and EEG Comp1. All relationships
had R2 > 0. Gray represents values between 0 and 0.2.

same way as in 3A. The y-axis is sorted by the average PANOVA of
the first two columns (CT and EEG Comp1) going from the lowest
average PANOVA (most significant) to the highest (least significant).
Note that the ordering is therefore not the same as in 3A and that
grey indicates a value of 0.05 or greater. The most significant
relationships also had the best R2 values for trend fits. Prominently,
the relationship between EEG Principal Components and Context
Principal Components had PANOVA values of 10-9 or lower
indicating a profoundly strong relationship between dynamical
features of the brain and life context.

Fig. 3A shows the R2 of the best fit for each context factor versus
each EEG feature. Along the x-axis the matrix is sorted by the
correlation of the EEG features/principal components to each
other thereby bringing CT and EEG Comp1 next to one another.
Along the y-axis the EEG features are sorted based on the average
R2 of CT and EEG Comp1, which tended to be similar as CT
dominated EEG Comp1. The strongest and most significant
relationships, with R2 >0.9, were between each of CT and EEG
Comp1 and the composite component scores of the factors
(Context Comp1, which was roughly evenly made up of all factors
and Context Comp2, which was dominated by Geofootprint).
The next strongest were between each of CT and EEG Comp1 and
Geofootprint and then Income, which had R2 values above 0.8.
We note here that given that geofootprint represents an ordered
categorization of an underlying variable, but not a systematic or
ordinal scale, a fit should strictly not be performed. However we
have included it for the purpose of approximate comparison.

In order to see both components of the relationship R2 and PANOVA
together we plotted these against each other (Fig.4). Figs. 4A,
B shows the R2 versus PANOVA for each of CT and EEG Comp1
(4A) and the Alpha Oscillation features (4B) to Context Comp1,
Context Comp2, Daily Family Income and Daily Individual
Income. Both income and the component scores are more macro
factors. While the component scores are a weighted score of all the
factors, income is an enabler of all the factors.

With regard to the features of the alpha oscillation, the largest
R2 was between Eα and fuel consumption or fuel spend (0.95,
exponential fit). In contrast the fits for Pα relative to the context
factors were not as strong, although wtPα (Pα weighted by Eα) had
strong relationships with income as well as the composite Context
Components scores, particularly Context Comp2.

Figs. 4C,D show the similar relationships for Geofootprint,
Population and Education which are demographic and
environmental factors of exposure. In this group Geofootprint had
the greatest R2 and significance with respect to most EEG features,
more so than education. The most significant relationship was
with complexity and the first component score as shown by their
position in the bottom right corner with R2 >0.85 and pANOVA
<10-7.

Fig. 3B shows the PANOVA for the grouping of EEG features into
each bin of the context factor of comparison (as defined in 3A
above). Here again, the matrix is sorted along the x-axis in the

Fig. 4E,F shows the relationship of EEG features with expenditure
on technology; mobile phone, fuel and electricity. Relative to
the other categories, technology factors had far less significant
relationships to these EEG features and only mobile and fuel spend
fell below the significance level of 0.05 (dotted line). Interestingly,
Eα had a more systematic and significant relationships to mobile

phone and fuel spend (Fig. 5B,C) than the CT and EEG Comps 1
and 2. The relationship between fuel spend and Eα was the most
significant stand out. The R2 was very high though the PANOVA was
only moderately significant (P=0.003). This was on account of a
systematic skewing of the distributions rather than the progressive
shift that was characteristic of geofootprint and education.

of maximal variability among the population. The first EEG
component (EEG Comp1) scaled sigmoidally in relation to the first
Context Component (Fig. 6A; PANOVA= 1.96 x 10-9 R2=0.94) and
linearly with the second Context Component (Fig. 6B; PANOVA=
8.54 x 10-10 R2=0.95). The second EEG Component (dominated
by Pα) was not as tightly related but nonetheless scaled linearly
with both Context Components 1 and 2 (Fig. 6C,D; PANOVA= 1.75
x 10-3 R2= 0.89 for Context Comp1 and PANOVA= 4.54 x 10-3 R2 =
0.59 for Context Comp2). However, we do point out that this does
not imply a linear relationship with the components of modern life.
Given the long tail structure of the various data elements such as
income and mobile phones, the principal components are derived
from logarithmic transforms of many of the data elements. Thus
the effective relationships are nonlinear in nature.

In Fig.5 we show the most noteworthy relationships between the
EEG alpha oscillation features and individual factors: between
Eα and fuel consumption (5A), and wtPα and education (5B) and
income (5C). Note that the relationships of Complexity with these
factors has been shown in [18] and has therefore not been repeated
here. The complete set of relationships between all EEG features and
Context factors are shown in Supplementary Figures: Daily Family
Income (Sup. Fig. 1), Education (Sup. Fig. 2), Geofootprint/Travel
(Sup. Fig. 3), Mobile Phone Usage (Sup. Fig. 4), Fuel Consumption
(Sup. Fig. 5) and Electricity Spend (Sup. Fig 6).
Finally, we show the relationships between the first two EEG
Components and the first two Context Components (Fig. 6). As
described earlier, the EEG components represent composite views
of the overall dynamical characteristics along the components

DISCUSSION

education are not very significant. However, those who make the
transition to college are considerably higher in their EEG metrics
perhaps because they are a select group that has performed at a
higher level in their secondary education. This group also has
significantly higher income overall, as they could not otherwise
afford to go to college. This also means that their secondary
education is likely to have been of higher quality. Finally, many of
our participants were from small villages and towns in India where
the method of education was purely textbook based without the
interactive technology and tools of today. It would therefore be
of interest to explore different methods of education to determine
how much our results are a consequence of a poor quality of
education or a particular system rather than a general statement
about classroom instruction.

We have described here the relationship between three fundamental
aspects of the resting EEG signal, the complexity of the waveform
and the peak frequency and energy of the alpha oscillation, and the
contextual factors of income, geofootprint, population, education
and spending on mobile phone usage, fuel and electricity. Overall
we show that the magnitude of these EEG features increases as
a function of these life context factors indicating that the more
access one has to the various aspects of modern living, the more
enhanced these features were in the brain.
A host of studies have shown that lower income and education
are associated with structural differences in the brain [5-11] and
that environmental enrichment is associated with a vast array
of cellular and molecular changes in animals [12-15]. However
this study is the first to combine observations of EEG with such
a large number of contextual factors and such a broad crosssection of human populations. Our results provide not just a
deeper understanding of the various factors of influence and
their interrelationships, but also a clear picture of the magnitude
of difference and the manner in which the change occurs. Many
of the relationships were highly systematic and of unquestionable
magnitude and significance. Overall, complexity and the first
principal component EEG Comp1, which was dominated by
complexity, had the most dramatic relationship to the various
contextual factors of modernization. We discuss below some of
the key findings and their implications.

The logarithmic effect of income
Both complexity and the weighted Pα had very strong relationships
with income, which is one of the most significant enablers of access
to experiences and technologies. In both cases the relationship
with income was clearly logarithmic. The steepest part of the
curve was between $1 and $30/day in family income indicating
that there were substantial gains as income increased up to $30/
day. However as one went beyond $50/day the differences in
the populations were no longer substantially different. $30/day
corresponds to an annual income of $10,950, which in India
provides access to all features of modern living. In PPP terms
$30/day in India is roughly $90/day in the United States and is
considered high income by global standards. At this income
level, one can comfortably own a car, smart phone and modern
household amenities as well as have 24 hour internet access.
Importantly, in 2011 PPP terms, globally only 7% of humanity
live on >$50 a day (considered high income) and 16% on $20-$50/
day (considered upper-middle income) respectively; in India only
about 0.5% have incomes between $20 and $50 per day[20]. By
contrast in the United States 89% have incomes >$20/day.

Geofootprint as a key influencer
Every EEG feature except Pα had a dramatic and highly significant
relationship to geofootprint or the spatial extent of one’s travel,
with the relationship with Complexity being the most systematic.
Further, geofootprint reflecting travel in the past year appeared
to have higher significance than the geofootprint of ones lifetime.
This ran counter to our expectation that education would have
the most dominant correlation to ones brain complexity. In this
context it is interesting to note that while education and mobile
phone use were very tightly coupled to income, geofootprint
varied more independently of income and other factors. This
makes sense when one considers that unlike education, which is
an institutionalized experience, geofootprint or the exploration of
the physical world generally comes about by personal choice. Such
exploration is also a complex interactive experience compared to
the more didactic, text book based learning that is characteristic
of the Indian education system. Traveling requires planning
and navigating new spatial environments, people, languages and
cultures and a forced learning of new things. Indeed, migratory
populations that have traveled long distances in search of new
resources have played a fundamental role in shaping human
history. It will be of considerable interest to explore more deeply
the nature and direction of influence of travel and migration.

It is also of interest to note that a study in the United States showed
a similar logarithmic relationship to the surface area of the
cortex[9]. Indeed the various structural differences in the brain
that are associated with brain structure such as increased cortical
thickness and surface area [5-11] would be expected to translate to
changes in its aggregate dynamical function as measured by EEG.

Fuel consumption and the alpha oscillation
Compared to complexity, the features of the alpha oscillation
were not as systematically related to any of the features of
modernization that we looked at. However, it is clear that the
alpha oscillations are much more prominent in the higher income
groups and were virtually undetectable in the majority of the premodern group. Of all the relationships, the most intriguing was
between the energy of the alpha oscillation and fuel consumption.
Unlike geofootprint, which captures a more complex experience of
navigating new places, fuel consumption reflects largely daily local
car travel. Consequently it is also a proxy for the speed at which
a person experiences visual stimuli. It has been suggested that
the alpha oscillation plays a role in enabling attention on salient
aspects while suppressing others [21, 22]. This would therefore
be a useful feature that was substantially enhanced as we began
experiencing the world at faster speeds.

The impact of education
In our study, years of education like geofootprint, was also
significantly related to all EEG factors except Pα, although
with slightly less significant statistics. Overall, we see that the
enhancement of EEG features is most prominent for the first
five years of education while the effects of the years of secondary

Implications

cognitive function. More poignantly our findings indicate that as
a species, we are diverging dramatically in our cognitive function.
Unlike the heart, which beats and performs in the same way for all
of us, our brain does not. Indeed, the metrics of brain dynamics
can only be described in context and there is no absolute ‘normal’
like there is for other organs such as the heart. With the tools of
modern advance and the its correlates of cognitive function still a
relative privilege for much of humanity, what does this mean for
our future as a collective species?

These metrics of the EEG that we have shown clearly scale with
various elements of life context. What does this mean in the context
of cognitive function? The alpha oscillation has been widely
studied and demonstrated to have positive correlation to a number
of cognitive capacities[23, 24] such as working memory[25-27],
attention[28-30] and learning ability[31]. Conversely it declines
with increasing age[27] and is found at lower levels in fragile X
mental retardation syndrome[32] and in patients with Alzheimer’s
and amnesic mild cognitive impairment[33]. Complexity, as we
have defined it, has not been extensively tested in its relevance to
cognitive function. However, our limited study has shown a very
significant correlation to performance on a pattern completion test
[18]. Various entropy measures, however, which are closely related
to this measure of complexity correlate with levels of consciousness
measured during the application of anesthesia [34, 35] as well as by
comparing people who are in different states of consciousness (e.g.
minimally conscious and coma)[36]. In the context of our findings
this suggests that modern advances have dramatically enhanced
