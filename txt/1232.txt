Introduction: Video games are common cultural issues with great influence in all societies. One
of the important cognitive effects of video games is on creating stress on video players. The present
research objective was to study different types of stress in players based on video game styles.
Methods: A total of 80 players, aged 18 to 30 years, played four types of video games; Runner
game, Excitement game, Fear game, and Puzzle game. In the beginning, the players filled in the form
of personal information as well as some general and specialized information on the games. Before
starting each game, the saliva samples of the players were collected to measure their level of cortisol
and α-amylase. At the end of each game, the same samples were collected again. The concentrations
of cortisol and α-amylase were measured using a specialized kit and an ELISA device. In addition, the
variations of brain waves were recorded by an Emotiv system. Finally, the data were analyzed in SPSS
and Matlab system (after and before playing video game).
Results: The research findings revealed that the salivary α-amylase concentration increased
significantly after playing the Fear game, Runner game, and Excitement game and decreased
significantly after playing the Puzzle game. Moreover, the concentration of salivary cortisol increased
significantly after playing the Runner game, Excitement game, and Fear game and decreased
significantly after playing the Puzzle game. The brain wave analysis also revealed that the level of
stress experienced by playing Fear game was higher than the Excitement game.
Conclusion: According to the research findings, video games can affect the stress system as well as
the cognitive system of humans depending on the game style. In addition, the type and level of stress
triggered in the players depend on the game style.

● The type of stress depends on the game style.
● The resulting stress may reinforce the cognitive elements or destroy them.

Plain Language Summary
The attractiveness of the computer games and also the day by day increase on the number of their corresponding
audiences on one hand, and their different cognitive (positive and negative) effects on the players' nervous system on
the other hand have motivated conducting research and investigation in this area. The purpose of this research is to
study the level and type of different stress effects on the players based on the game style diversity. In this research, four
styles of computer games were studied: Puzzle games, Runner games, Excitement games, and Fear games. Based on
the results, four different types of stress have been found from the NuroGame perspective. In other words, we studied
the possibility of categorizing the games on the basis of their stress effect on players and the classification was made
based on that. The results have depicted different cognitive responses and alterations on the players (in positive and
negative ways) that makes the classification possible.

1. Introduction

ideo games are an interactive medium
and a novel technology spreading all
over the globe. Neurologists and researchers are much interested in video
games due to their effects on the nervous system. Because of their nature, these games can
activate different parts of the brain. They activate the
cortical regions of the brain such as the frontal cortex, the sensory-motor cortex, the visual cortex, and
the subcortical areas (such as the amygdala and hippocampus), which play a substantial role in emotions
and cognition, and thus considerably contribute to the
personal behavior and cognitive functions (Aliyari et
al., 2015; Lupien et al., 2005; Smeets, Otgaar, Candel,
& Wolf, 2008). Stress is an important cognitive reaction significantly affected by video games.
According to new definitions, stress is a mental state
affecting both mind and body. Some parts of the brain
such as the prefrontal lobe are mainly associated with
cognition and stress experience. Stress is of the acute
and chronic types. Acute stress triggers the autonomic
nervous system and increases the excretion of the cortisol, adrenaline, and other hormones (Lupien et al., 2005;
Smeets et al., 2008). The unnatural rise in the level of
cortisol results in an increase in the heartbeat, respiration rate, and blood pressure. Accordingly, the blood
redirects from the end organs to the large muscles so
the body gets ready to fight or escape. This condition

178

is known as the fight-or-flight response. Chronic stress,
on the other hand, refers to the long-term effect of one
or several stress factors on human’s life. These chronic
stress stimulations may result in the outbreak of neurological diseases such as anxiety and depression (Beylin
& Shors, 2003; Lupien & Lepage, 2001; McEwen &
Morrison, 2013).
Concerning neuroanatomical positions, many parts of
the brain are associated with the stress state. Some of
these areas include hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex as well as forebrain and midbrain,
which are associated with chronic stress and the downscaling of the dendrites (Krawczyk, 2002; McEwen &
Morrison, 2013; Rosenbloom, Schmahmann, & Price,
2012). The pathologic activation of the stress system
and the adrenal-sympathetic system leads to an unnatural increase of the hormones and impairment of the
nervous system. In this regard, video games are among
the important causes of changes of the cognitive functions (Aliyari et al., 2015; Bartholow, Bushman, & Sestir, 2006; Lupien et al., 2005). Since the stress system is
closely associated with cognitive functions (i.e. memory,
learning, and reward) in the nervous system, the secretion of cortisol has different dose-dependent effects. An
effective dose of cortisol enables humans to cope with
stress and plays an important role in consciousness,
motivation, attention, concentration, memory, decision
making, and learning. However, an improper dose results in the inability to cope with stress, affects the normal performance of these systems, and impairs the order

and coordination of the brain functions (i.e. concentration, attention, decision making, memory, and learning).
Hence, the person’s cognition may be impaired under
chronic stress (Anderson, Kludt, & Bavelier, 2011; Beylin & Shors, 2003; Lupien et al., 2005; Maheu, Joober,
& Lupien, 2005).
Research results have indicated that improper performance of the stress system may result in reactions generally known as fear. One of the most important responses
to this malfunction is the increase in the secretion of the
salivary enzyme (α-amylase). This reaction happens
very quickly and shows its effect within a few seconds.
Hence, an increase in the concentration of the salivary
α-amylase is a noninvasive simple bio-indicator that
could be used to measure the activity of the sympathetic
nervous system. In other words, this enzyme is known
as the fear marker (Davis & Granger, 2009; Feinstein,
Adolphs, Damasio, & Tranel, 2011; Nater & Rohleder,
2009), in other words, a valuable means of studying the
stress-induced fear. Research results have indicated that
the level of this enzyme varies in response to acute and
chronic stress. The increase in the level of this enzyme
occurs due to an increase in the activity of the adrenergic system in salivary glands (Davis & Granger, 2009;
Green & Bavelier, 2003).
In addition, research findings suggest that the type of
stress is associated with concentration, which can have
positive or negative effects (Boot, Kramer, Simons, Fabiani, & Gratton, 2008; LaBar & Cabeza, 2006; Weber,
Ritterfeld, & Mathiak, 2006). In video games, stress varies by the game style. For instance, the logic stress is a
type of stress under which the person only searches for
logical solutions to handle the stressor and the situation.
Under this type of stress, the person feels no temporal
and spatial constraint and can travel the path to the goal at
any time. In addition, no destructive pressure is put on the
person, and the person can use his or her knowledge and
capabilities to attain the goals peacefully and even reinforce his or her capabilities (LaBar & Cabeza, 2006; Szu�
bert & Jaśkowski, 2014). The main stress factor involved
in the development of the limit stress is restraint, and
its evident examples are temporal restraints. Under this
type of stress, the person needs to accomplish the tasks
quickly and carefully to handle the situation. To solve the
problem, the person not only must pay adequate attention
but also does need to have the ability to make temporal
and spatial predictions and function quickly to coordinate
the neural and muscular (sensory-motor) systems (Boot
et al., 2008; Gracia-Bafalluy & Noel, 2008). Fear stress
is undoubtedly the type of stress we have all experienced.
Under this type of stress, the activity of the neuroendo-

crine system is at its peak, and thus the characteristics of
the vague type of stress are evident in this type associated
with recognizable signs and symptoms. It deprives the affected person of the ability to decide accurately and duly.
Moreover, the affected person loses its concentration on
the environment and fails to function satisfactorily (Burdo, 2014; Weber et al., 2006). Interactive stress is a type
of stress associated with interaction with the surrounding elements in video games. Under this type of stress,
the affected person experiences stress due to his or her
presence in the environment, the sensory inputs (including the visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile inputs), and
his or her previous experiences and memories (Ballard &
Wiest, 1996; LaBar & Cabeza, 2006).
EEG signals reflect the electric activities of the brain.
These signals carry useful information on the performance of the brain, and thus are widely used in the fields
of medicine, pathological conditions, mind engineering,
and cognitive markers. This method is widely used by
different researchers in various fields to noninvasively
assess the variations of brain signals (Ballard & Wiest,
1996; Burdo, 2014). As a powerful means of demonstrating brain activity, EEG signals play a major role in
most studies on brain. Hence, the ability to measure and
record EEG signals that are free of pollution is an important goal of these studies. Perhaps an EEG signal is the
only type of data that provides online and direct information on the condition of the brain and its activity (Burdo,
2014; Weber et al., 2006). Since stress is not always destructive and its effects depend on its type, this study was
conducted to examine the different types of stress with
regard to the style of video games.

2. Methods
A total of 80 male volunteers aged between 18 and 30
years enrolled in this research project. The study questionnaire gathered the relevant data about personal
characteristics of the players, the games of interest, game
type, how much do they play per day, and so on. The
volunteers were grouped into four (each 20 members).
In this research, four video games namely the Runner
game, Fear game, Excitement game, and Puzzle game,
were investigated. Each group played one type of the
games. The saliva samples of all participants were collected before and after playing the games using 10-mm
falcon tubes, which were stored at -20ºC in a freezer. On
the day of experimentation, the samples were liquefied
at room temperature and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for
5 minutes. Afterwards, 20 µL of each sample was isolated for the test, and the human cortisol ELISA kit (Diagnostics Biochem Canada Inc.,) was used to measure

the level of salivary cortisol. Also, Pars Azmun kit was
used to measure the levels of salivary α-amylase. The
brain waves of the players were recorded and analyzed
online using an Emotiv device. A total of 14 electrodes
were placed on different locations of participants’ heads
from the beginning to the end of the games to record the
changes of brain waves. To identify the differences, first,
the EEG signals of the participants’ brains were recorded. Afterwards, the data were filtered and the noises were
omitted. The necessary features were extracted and classified using the machine learning algorithms. In the end,
the data were analyzed and the algorithms were tested.
The obtained data were analyzed in Matlab and R.

2.2. Data analysis
The research data were expressed as Mean±SD
(Mean±SEM) values. The non-parametric Wilcoxon test
method was used to determine the differences between
the groups. The significance level was also set at <0.05.

3. Results

2.1.1. Puzzle game
A Puzzle game generally improves concentration,
memory, and the harmony between the hands and the
brain. This game is based on the mathematical sum function. Interestingly, this type of game has gained extensive popularity after a short period of time, because its
immense allure entertains the player for hours. Stress is
caused by the fear of inability to function.
2.1.2. Runner game
The symphony of tiles makes the user calm and enables him or her to avoid addiction to the game. This
game is classified as a musical game. Another source
of attraction of this game is the excitement caused by
the rapid and simultaneous movement of the fingers and
the eyes, which results in the composition of a pleasant
song. The cause of stress in this game is time limitations.
2.1.3. Fear game
Many video games released in the fear and horror category claim to induce fear in the player. Some of these
games show disgusting scenes, some others try to frighten the player with the aid of psychological stresses, and a
group of games uses a combination of these factors. The
key to winning this game is to frighten the player with
the aid of sound effects. You will be frightened when
you play this game but the fear is mainly caused by the
mysterious sounds rather than the disgusting faces of the
characters. This type of fear is known as the fear of the
unknown and is considered a psychological type of fear.
2.1.4. Excitement game
It is a violent and highly exciting game in which the
player fights all of his or her rivals and beats them to

180

win the game. You must get used to the bloodbath and
the torn apart body parts you will see during the game.
However, the blood, flesh pieces, and crushed bones are
the elements of a very detailed and entertaining fighting
game that amaze you from the moment you start to play.
You will fight characters that fight quickly and thoughtlessly in a highly dynamic detailed environment.

The research findings indicate that the variations of
the salivary α-amylase concentration decreased significantly after playing the Puzzle game type (P<0.001)
(Figure 1). In addition, it was found out that the concentrations of the salivary α-amylase increased after playing the Runner game type (P<0.001) (Figure 1). It was
also found that the variations of the salivary α-amylase
escalated significantly after playing the Fear game type
(P<0.0001) (Figure 1).
Finally, the changes of the variations of the salivary
alpha-amylase increased significantly after playing
the Excitement game type (P<0.001) (Figure 1). The
mean variations of the concentration of α-amylase are
depicted in Figure 1 and the percentages of the mean
variations of the salivary α-amylase are presented in
Table 1. According to Figure 2 the largest change was
caused by the fear game.
According to the research findings, the variations of
the concentration of the salivary cortisol decreased significantly after playing the Puzzle game type (P<0.001)
(Figure 3). The variations of the concentration of the salivary cortisol rose significantly after playing the Runner
game type (Figure 3). The variations of the concentration
of the salivary cortisol escalated significantly after playing the Fear game type (P<0.0001) (Figure 3).
Finally, the variations of the concentration of the salivary cortisol escalated significantly after playing the Excitement game type (P<0.001) (Figure 3). In addition,
the mean variations of the salivary cortisol after playing
the four games and the percentages of the mean variations of the salivary cortisol are shown in Figure 4 and

Figure 7. The changes of the stress feature of the brain signals of a participant after playing the Excitement game

Runner game showed that the concentration of cortisol
increased slightly after playing this game. The increase
in stress equals the circumvention of the time limitation,
which increases the activity of the stress system and induces fear to overcome this limitation. This time limitation is thought to have positive effects, increases human’s speed and reinforces the eye-hand coordination.
This kind of stress is known as the limit stress (GraciaBafalluy, & Noel, 2008).
The other findings of this research show that the levels
of cortisol and α-amylase increase significantly in the
players of Fear type game. Since this game is a horror
game it can be destructive in the long run because the
players are constantly feeling fear and stress, the adrenal
gland and the hypothalamus-pituitary axis are always
ready to function, and cortisol is released abnormally.
These endless activities impair human’s cognitive functions such as concentration, attention, decision-making,
and memory in the long run. This type of stress is known
as the fear stress (Burdo, 2014). The increase in the unnatural secretion of cortisol impairs the glutamate system, destroys the nervous synapses, and results in the
impairment of memory, learning, and emergence of
anger, violence, or depression. The increase in the concentration of extracellular glutamate and the excessive
activity of the ionotropic receptors cause toxicity, which
damages the nerve cells and the hippocampus synapses
(Krawczyk, 2002; Smeets et al., 2008; Yu, 2016).
The results of studies on the violent Excitement game
showed that the levels of cortisol and α-amylase of the
players increased significantly after playing this game.
This game is formed of a set of elements that are not
superior to one another, and thus the resulting stress cannot be attributed to a certain feature of the game. This is
because stress is caused by violent and frightening visual and sonic elements as well as timely decisions and

logic of the player. In other words, this game induces
interactive stress (Ballard & Wiest, 1996). Since the NMethyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptors play a major
role in transmitting the stimulating messages, plasticity,
and neural destruction of the central nervous system, the
excessive activity of these receptors leads to the generation of large amounts of neurotoxic substances that demolish the nerve cells and synapses. The physiological
effects of the damage are demonstrated in the form of
unwanted angry and violent behavior and depression and
a decrease in the cognitive readiness of the individual
(Ballard & Wiest, 1996; Fox, 2011).
Recently, stress is defined a mental state that affects
human brain and body. According to this definition, by
playing the Puzzle and Runner game, the players’ stressfear system is almost deactivated due to the activity of
the decision-making, attention, and concentration zones
of the brain (which include the prefrontal area and frontal
lobes). In addition, as seen in the provided diagrams, the
deactivation of the fear-stress system decreased significantly after playing Puzzle game and slightly after playing the Runner game. This difference is caused by the
described stress. In other words, the style-wise results
of this research proved that the elements of these games
had no destructive effect on the stress-fear systems of the
participants. The examinations of the Excitement game
and Fear game showed that the level of α-amylase (as
the marker of fear) and cortisol (as the market of stress)
changed significantly.
The escalation (%) of α-amylase concentration was
considerably higher in the players of the Fear game than
the players of the Excitement game. This finding reflects
the differences between the game contents. After playing these games the concentrations of cortisol increased,
but the percentage of variations was higher in the Fear
game. However, these differences were not considerable

as compared to the variations of the α-amylase levels.
The results obtained by recording the brain waves of the
players mainly indicated the development of fear after
playing the Fear game. In addition, the analysis of the
brain signals of the players who played the Excitement
game showed high levels of stress. Figure 8 shows that
the Fear game players had a larger stress performance
index compared to Excitement game players. In general, the type of stress depends on the game style, and
the resulting stress may reinforce the cognitive elements
or destroy them, but more research is required to clarify
the effects.
