Abstract: Objectives: This study investigated the effects of therapeutic structured limb exercises
intended to improve psychomotor speed in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
Methods: Forty‐four patients with mild cognitive impairment who met the inclusion criteria were
selected and assigned randomly to either an experimental group (22 patients) or a control group (22
patients). The numbers of participants were selected based on the calculated sample effect size (N =
38). The study involved a 10‐week intervention, in which participants completed structured limb
exercises during 60‐min training sessions delivered three times per week. Forty‐one subjects
completed the experimental programme. Scores in the Finger Tapping Test (FTT), Purdue Pegboard
Test (PPT) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), along with electroencephalography (EEG)
data, were collected before, during and after the intervention. The experimental and control groups
were compared using repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: The patients with MCI in the
experimental group achieved significantly improved scores in the FTT, the PPT and all dimensions
of the MoCA. Moreover, these patients exhibited significant increases in the alpha and beta EEG
wave power values in all brain areas of MCI patients, indicating that limb exercise training
positively influenced their brain functions. Conclusions: The results conclude that a structured
therapeutic limb exercise intervention can effectively improve psychomotor speed in patients with
MCI and mitigate declines in cognitive function. This training intervention appears to be effective
as a treatment for community‐dwelling patients with MCI.

1. Introduction
Population ageing is a global phenomenon that has attracted international attention in the
twenty‐first century. Statistics indicate that older adults (aged >60 years) accounted for 11% of the
global population in 2000, and estimates suggest that this population will double and thus account
for 22% of the world population by 2050 [1]. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative
disease that severely impairs a person’s cognitive function, thus hindering their self‐care ability and
inducing disordered psychological behaviour [2]. According to the WHO, approximately 35.6 million
people were affected by dementia in 2012, representing an annual increase of 4.6 million cases. The
number of AD patients is expected to double within decades if timely and effective preventive
measures and interventions are not provided [3].

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage between normal brain ageing and early‐
stage dementia (particularly AD). Although people with MCI are affected by symptoms of memory
impairment at an earlier than normal stage, their memory functions remain satisfactory and do not
severely affect their daily lives or activities [4]. Older adults commonly experience decreases in
cognitive function with ageing, and this trend is particularly evident with respect to memory function
[5]. In the initial stage, AD is frequently associated with MCI and the gradual development of
cognitive impairment and functional disorders within a few years [6]. Therefore, MCI accelerates the
risk of AD development, and in particular, memory impairment is a major symptom in patients with
MCI. In the absence of timely treatment, 50% of patients with MCI will develop AD within 5 years
[7]. Current studies of AD prevention have shifted from the clinical phase to the preclinical phase,
given the particular importance of MCI prevention and reduction in older adults (aged ≥65 years). In
other words, early MCI diagnosis and intervention are critical to preventing the development of AD.
Psychomotor speed (PS) is a sensitive index used to measure psychomotor function [8]. PS tests
are used to measure central brain functions, such as the reaction speed and accuracy, during the
performance of simple or complicated actions after receiving stimulation. Early studies of PS
measurement included only the simple reaction time and choice reaction time [9–11]. (Pate and
Margolin, 1994; Baddeley et al., 2001; Levinoff et al., 2005). However, these parameters comprise only
a fraction of PS behaviours. According to Sobin and Sackeim [12], who conducted an observation of
the psychomotor characteristics of patients with depression, four levels of PS can be observed and
measured: gross motor activity, body movements, speech and motor response time. A slow PS
manifests in multiple forms, and the external signs mainly involve slowness in basic movements (e.g.,
whole body activity or fine motor activities), slowness and incoherence in language, and reduced
calculation abilities. People with a severely slowed PS may experience a decline in their performance
of daily activities (e.g., bathing, getting out of bed, dressing and answering phone calls) and may be
incapable of making prompt decisions in response to unexpected incidents [13]. (MBF, 2008). Patients
with MCI exhibit evident deficiencies in their abilities to perform dual tasks [14]. Moreover, a slow
PS may be particularly evident in patients with mental illnesses, such as depression [15,16] or
schizophrenia [17]. Studies have indicated that depression is a risk factor for the development of
dementia and MCI, and that the cognitive function symptoms exhibited by patients with depression
and MCI are highly consistent with the symptoms associated with a slow PS [18,19]. Therefore, this
study used an improvement in PS as the basis for establishing an intervention strategy intended to
delay and prevent continuous impairments in cognitive function in patients with MCI.
Recent studies have explored the critical ability of physical exercise to improve cognitive abilities
and brain function. Numerous studies have verified the protective effect of physical exercise on
cognitive function in later life [20,21], as well as the different effects of variation in the form, intensity
and frequency of exercise [22,23]. The effects of an exercise intervention on the cognitive functions of
young and older adults have been investigated by several studies. Levin, Leon, Karssemeijer and
their teams [24–26] utilizes systematic review and meta‐analysis to analyse the combined cognitive
and physical exercises on cognitive function in older adults with MCI or dementia. The results of
their studies reported positive cognitive benefits for older people with MCI or dementia.
Opportune exercise training has critical effects on the cognitive functions of older adults. In older
adults, physical condition is related closely to the degeneration of hippocampal brain tissue. Exercise
can induce fibroblast growth factor expression in the hippocampus and increase the hippocampal
volume in older adults. Consequently, these effects alter the brain structure, enhance neuronal vitality
and delay the degeneration of cognitive function in this population. Therefore, exercise is clearly a
valuable component of MCI prevention [27].
Currently, no treatments prevent or reverse the course of AD, and only a few options can be
used to ease and improve symptoms temporarily [28]. MCI intervention strategies comprise both
drug and non‐drug interventions, such as physical training, cognitive interventions and
psychological interventions. Most studies have recommended that MCI treatments focus primarily
on non‐drug interventions to prevent and reduce the side effects of drugs [29,30]. There are several
studies that used psychomotor speed, processing speed and reaction time to measure the effects of

Brain Sci. 2019, 9, 277

physical training for the improvement of participants [31]. Pluncevic‐Gligoroska [16] and Poon’
studies aimed to examine the possible relationship between psychomotor speed expressed by the
Trial Making Test (TMT), the results suggest that regular physical activity have a positive impact on
cognitive processes. Poon’s studies also conclude that the psychomotor speed of fit young and older
adults is faster than the speeds of their less fit age‐mates, and that physical training programs results
in the improvement of participants’ response speeds.
Although several studies have investigated the beneficial effects of different types of physical
exercises (e.g., Tai Chi, bowling/croquet, cycling, resistance training, waling, psychomotor exercises
and aerobic exercises) on psychomotor and cognitive functions in old age [24,25,32,33], previous
studies have rarely reported using a structured therapeutic psychomotor limbs‐exercise programme
as a treatment on the effects of older adults with MCI who reside in urban communities and nursing
homes. In addition, singular exercise training methods have been used in previous studies, and the
conventional content designs of these methods have frequently neglected mind and body related
exercises and PS, a sensitive indicator of cognitive function. This study had the following goals:




To determine whether PS is correlated with cognition level in patients with MCI and whether it
can be regarded as an indicator to measure the cognitive functions of patients with MCI;
to assess a potential structured limbs exercise programme to improve the cognitive functions of
MCI patients according to their PS and cognition level; and
to evaluate a limb exercise project intended to improve the PS of patients with MCI to improve
cognitive functions such as cognition level and electroencephalography (EEG) results.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants
Our screening of older adults residing in Communities A and B and Nursing Home C yielded
44 elderly patients with MCI. We divided the subjects randomly into a limb exercise training
intervention group and a control group. The criteria for participant recruitment are shown in Table 1.

Table 1. Inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria.

Inclusion Criteria
The inclusion criteria were based broadly on the
diagnosis criteria of mild cognitive impairment (MCI):
 Chief complaint of memory impairment by the
patient, caretaker or informants.
 Aged 60–70 years. Educational attainment of
elementary school or higher.
 Score 24–26 on the scale of Mini Mental State
Examination (MMSE, Typically, people with
an educational attainment of elementary
school receive a score of >20 on the MMSE
scale, and those with an educational
attainment of junior high school or above
receive a score of >24.
 Relatively normal level of self‐care ability in
performing activities of daily living (ADL),
indicated by attaining a score of >60 on an ADL
scale. No history of dementia according to the
diagnosis of a psychiatrist
 Being informed of the research project and
voluntarily consenting to participate.

Exclusion Criteria
The exclusion criteria were based
broadly on the diagnosis criteria of
MCI:
 Patients
with
vascular
dementia, Parkinson disease,
or any physical or mental
disease‐causing
brain
dysfunction.
 Patients who had undergone
surgery within 1 year.
 Patients with impaired visual
and hearing functions
 Patients with impaired heart
function who have been
restricted from exercising.
 Patients with a terminal
disease and a life expectancy of
less than 6 months.

Sample Size Calculation: Prior to the data collection, power analysis was performed to determine
the sample size. Based on our pilot study of the experimental design, we determined a large effect
(Cohen’s f = 0.502) of the intervention on the cognition level (measured using the Montreal Cognitive
Assessment (MoCA)). At an α value of 0.05 and β (power) value of 0.95, our power analysis indicated
that 19 participants per group would be required to detect a large effect (N = 38). The decision was
made to oversample (N = 44) to accommodate an expected attrition rate of 15%. The 44 subjects
resided in 15 residential quarters of two urban communities. Equal numbers of patients were
included in the control and experimental groups because classrooms were assigned randomly to the
two groups (Table 2). A power analysis indicated that the sample size was adequate for the proposed
study.

2.2. Instruments
We randomly selected 44 elderly participants aged 60–70 years. The Mini Mental State
Examination (MMSE) and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Scale were used to screen subjects for the
study. The following test instruments were used to collect data at the baseline, interim and post‐
intervention time points and to verify the results of the intervention: for PS, the Finger Tapping Test

(FTT) and Purdue Pegboard Test (PPT); and for cognitive level, MoCA and EEG (Emotive EPOC,
Emotive Company, SF, USA.
2.3. Structured Limbs‐Exercises
The limb exercise at this stage aims to develop the task execution capacity, attentiveness, fine
motor skills, hand–eye coordination, reaction time, balance, and upper and lower body coordination
of MCI patients (Table 3).

Upper Limb Exercises
Subjects are required to insert small metal pegs into a prepared pegboard. Subsequently,
they have to remove the pegs in a specific order. The task is repeated 3 times, with each time
lasting for approximately 3 min (total about 10 min)
Subjects are asked to stand at a designated place and throw palm‐sized sandbags at a 50 ×
50 cm2 area approximately 1.5–2.0 m away from them. The subjects are required to retrieve
the sandbags and throw them again for 10 times.
Basketball or ball with identical size is used for the seated exercise. First, the subjects are
required to sit steadily on a chair and holding a ball in front of the chest with both hands.
Subjects are asked to rotate to the left and right 10 times each (1 min). Raise the ball over
their head and then return to the original pose. These exercises are repeated for 10 times (1
min). Finally, hold the ball with both hands in front of their chest and apply pressure to the
ball by pressing their palms against it. The exercise is repeated for 10 times (1 min). The ball‐
holding exercise approximately lasted for 5 min.
Lower Limb Exercises
Forty 30 × 30 cm squares were marked on the ground as 10 rows with each row comprising
4 squares. The squares in each row are randomly numbered from 1 to 4. The subjects are
required to move in the order of the numbered squares (from 1 to 4) from Row 1 to 10.
Completing this process is counted as one round. The task can repeat for several times as
required. The total practice time is about 10 min.
Subjects are asked to stand while shifting the body weight alternatively between their toes
and heels. The subjects are required to practice the exercise several times within 5 min.

2.4. Experimental Design
This study adopted a quasi‐experimental design that included both a randomised control trial
and a questionnaire. Under this quasi‐experimental design, the study applied grouped comparisons
among the baseline, interim and post‐test time points, and used a repeated measures analysis of
variance (ANOVA) for the data analysis. Subjects were allocated randomly to the experimental and
control groups. Details of the test arrangements are shown in Table 4.

2.5. Intervention and Procedures
Five patients with MCI who satisfied the recruitment criteria and passed a screening protocol
based on the MMSE and ADL scales were included in a pilot study. This pilot study was conducted

Brain Sci. 2019, 9, 277

to improve the preliminary procedures at an early experimental stage, derive relevant assumptions
and increase the rates of success of subsequent experiments in the official programme. The formal
research intervention was commenced upon completing the pilot study.
During the formal experiment, the subjects in the control group participated in regular activities
at a community senior activity centre (e.g., reading, chess and card games, singing and dancing). In
addition to these regular daily activities, the subjects in the experimental group participated in a limb
exercise intervention. They were divided into several subgroups (n = 7 or 8 per group). The duration
of each limb exercise session was 60 min, and the sessions were held three times per week. During
the first week, the researcher taught the limb exercise to the subjects. Beginning in the second week,
subgroups of subjects were asked to participate in the limb exercise intervention. The subjects were
also required to keep a record of their training conditions. The researcher and group heads monitored
and instructed the subjects in each group.
The research intervention procedures are described in Figure 1.

2.6. Statistics and Data Analysis
SPSS Version 18 was used to organise and analyse the data. The χ2 test and an independent
sample t‐test were used to compare the baseline levels of all variables between the two groups. To
evaluate the measurements and ranked data with non‐normal distributions, the Mann–Whitney U
rank‐sum test was used to balance the distributions of the related variables between the groups before
the intervention. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relationship
between the subjects’ PS and cognition levels.
Significant differences in the subjects’ PS, MoCA scores and EEG features were analysed to
evaluate the influence of the limb exercise intervention on cognitive functions.
3. Results
3.1. Correlational Analysis of PS vs. Cognition Level
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was calculated for a correlational analysis of PS. As
shown in Table 5, all of the FTT and PPT dimension scores were correlated significantly with each
other and with the MoCA test scores (all p < 0.05).
The PPT scores directly reflected the patients’ movement conditions and were correlated
strongly with the ADLs and movement‐related scores. The FTT was correlated strongly with some
ADLs and was influenced mainly by the patient’s cognitive and psychomotor conditions. The results
of this study confirm the correlation between the quantitative motor measure (QMM) and cognition
level.

3.2. Typical EEG Characteristics Observed in MCI Patients
The basic components of the EEG images obtained from 41 patients with MCI were examined
and analysed. The measurements revealed a decline in alpha rhythm speed, alpha wave activity and
alpha amplitude. Alpha wave activity slowed and even plateaued as the alpha index decreased. In
comparison, beta activity decreased slightly, and theta activity increased moderately (Figure 2).

3.3. Verification of the Role of the Limb Exercise Intervention in Enhancing the Cognition Levels of Patients
with MCI
3.3.1. Influence of the Limb Exercise Intervention on the PS of Patients with MCI
Before the intervention, the researcher examined the PS of the research subjects via the FTT and
PPT. On average, the subjects tapped their fingers 45.00 ± 5.43 times with the left hand and 48.39 ±
4.86 times with the right hand. No statistically significant differences were observed between the test
results of the two groups (all p > 0.05). During the PPT, an average of 12.27 ± 1.80, 13.22 ± 1.93, and
10.75 ± 1.51 pegs were inserted correctly by the left hand, the right hand and both hands, respectively.
No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups (all p > 0.05). In other
words, the subjects in the two test groups achieved balanced FTT and PPT results and were thus
comparable (Table 6).

Influence of the limb exercise training intervention on the cognition levels of patients with MCI.
Before the intervention, the Beijing version of MoCA was employed to measure the subjects’
cognition level. The subjects achieved an average total score of 17.15 ± 4.53. As shown in Table 9, no
significant differences in the visuospatial execution, naming, attention and calculation, language,
abstraction, delayed recall and orientation scores were observed between the two groups (all p > 0.05).

The Beijing version of the MoCA was used to evaluate the cognition levels of both subject groups
at baseline and Weeks 5 and 10. At Week 10, the subjects in the limb exercise training intervention
group had higher MoCA scores than those measured at baseline. Although the control group also
achieved increased MoCA scores, this increase was smaller than that observed in the experimental
group (Table 10).

3.3.2. Effect of Limb Exercise Training on the EEG Data Obtained from Patients with MCI
Before the intervention, the EEG data of the subjects in both groups were measured using an
Emotiv EPOC neuroheadset. At baseline, no significant inter‐group differences were observed in the
alpha and beta wave power values in any brain areas (all p > 0.05), and both groups exhibited mostly
consistent EEG power in all of the wavebands (Table 11).
The alpha and beta EEG wavebands were again measured in the two subject groups at the ends
of Weeks 5 and 10 of the intervention. The study further evaluated changes in the power values
observed in all brain areas, as shown in Table 12.

4. Discussion
In this study, we evaluated the forms, content and intensity of limb exercises designed to foster
an increase in PS. The objectives of this study were to investigate the ability of these exercises to
maintain the cognitive functions of patients with MCI, and to expose the effects of the exercises on
cognitive functions in this patient population.
4.1. Correlation between the PSs and Cognitive Functions of Patients with MCI
In our study, the patients with MCI had mean finger tap frequencies of 45.00 for the left hand
and 48.39 for the right hand, compared with an average of 37 per 10 seconds measured among healthy
Chinese adults aged >45 years [31–33]. In other words, PS was far lower in the patients with MCI than
in healthy adults. In the PPT, the subjects in our study achieved results similar to those of healthy
older adults, as reported by Sun and Desrosiers [34,35]. That earlier study, however, did not test the
cognitive functions of healthy elderly adults. Consequently, the PPT results of subjects in our study
cannot yet be compared with those of healthy elderly adults with a normal level of cognitive function.
In our study, the MoCA scale scores revealed a relatively obvious decline in visuospatial and
executive functions, consistent with the results of previously reported studies [36]. Most of the
patients with MCI exhibited normal levels of ability with respect to place orientation but were unsure
of the day of the week. This type of confusion might be due to the retired status of elderly adults and
an associated lack of concern regarding the day of the week. In summary, our findings suggest that
patients with MCI have accumulated damage in multiple cognitive domains, although the levels of
damage vary between these domains. The most severe and prevalent damage was observed in the
domains of delayed recall and visuospatial and executive function. An understanding of the
characteristics of cognitive impairment in elderly adults with MCI could aid in the identification and
diagnosis of community‐dwelling patients, who could then be referred for an early‐stage
intervention. Moreover, our study results revealed significant correlations between the scores
obtained in all dimensions of the FTT and PPT and all dimensions of the MoCA total score.
Furthermore, the scores for all dimensions of the FTT were significantly correlated with those for all
dimensions of the PPT. These results confirm that PS is a valid indicator of cognitive function and
can be used for the preliminary screening of patients with MCI.
The results may also support an analysis of the predictive value of the PS for the diagnosis of
MCI. Therefore, an understanding of the characteristics of PS in elderly adults with MCI would assist
in the early identification of affected patients, as well as early disease interventions.
4.2. Influences of Limb Exercise Training on the PS of Patients with MCI
During the limb exercise training project, the PPT and ball‐holding exercises mainly targeted the
fine motor control abilities of the hands, which indicate a person’s capacity to complete a specific task
mainly via movements of the minor muscles in the hands and fingers in coordination with
psychological activity (e.g., perception and attention). Previous studies [37] have investigated the
influence of hand activities, such as clapping, forming and releasing a fist, and consecutive finger
reversal with both hands, on cerebral cortex activation. Notably, clapping exerts the maximum effect
on functions throughout the brain. Specifically, clapping induces maximum changes in the motion
system and premotor areas, whereas consecutive finger reversal with both hands induces a maximum
change in the prefrontal area. Activity in these brain areas is closely related to cognitive function. In
this study, the fine motor abilities of patients with MCI were identified, and structured exercises were
then designed to target fine motor training specifically. Statistical feedback from the FTT was
examined and used to train the subjects with respect to the fine motor control abilities of the hands.
This intervention profoundly prevented and mitigated the decline in cognitive function and fine
motor ability in the hands observed in patients with MCI.
4.3. Influence of the Limb Exercise Training Intervention on the Cognition Levels of Patients with MCI

Brain Sci. 2019, 9, 277

19 of 21

After a 10‐week limb exercise intervention, patients with MCI in our training intervention group
exhibited an improvement of 5.85 points in the total MoCA score. Moreover, this improvement was
statistically significant relative to the outcome of the control group. This study referenced the
structured limb exercise interventions proposed by foreign scholars, Chinese cultural customs and
the conditions of Chinese community‐ and nursing home‐dwelling patients with MCI when
designing the intervention. The results confirm that this limb exercise training intervention improved
the cognitive functions of patients with MCI, consistent with the findings of several previous studies
[38,39].
4.4. Effect of Limb Exercise Training on the EEG Activities of Patients with MCI
In the cerebral hemispheres, bioelectrical activities are triggered by cerebral cortical pyramidal
cells and postsynaptic potentials and are regulated by nonspecific thalamic nuclei. The rhythms of
EEG activity are affected by stimuli and feedback among the thalamus, brainstem reticular formation
and cerebral cortex. Berger discovered that cerebral bioelectrical activities could be recorded via the
scalp (www.epub.org). In a healthy adult, the EEG mainly comprises alpha and beta waves, of which
the former comprises the majority. The two brainwaves are distributed in different areas of the brain.
Alpha waves are distributed mainly in the occipital and parietal lobes, whereas beta waves are
located mainly in the frontal and temporal lobes. The activities of alpha and beta waves are stable
and change in response to pathological alterations in the brain. The run charts generated in this study
explicitly revealed changes in the alpha wave power values in all brain regions over time, as well as
prominent variations in the data collected from the training group over time. As patients with MCI
face a high risk of AD, an understanding of the EEG characteristics in this population is highly
valuable for MCI prevention.
4.5. Design of Limb Exercise Training Interventions Intended to Enhance the Health of Older Adults
Physical activity is critical to physical development in older adults. This type of activity can alter
the social status and behaviour of this population and yield improvements in the quality of life. This
study explored the physical and psychological development of older adults and used various theories
and skills from physical training studies to provide education, consultation and training related to
physical health knowledge and skills. Consequently, the intervention developed in this study helped
the participants to cultivate regular exercise habits and improve their physical capacities and
cognitive functions, while ensuring harmonious physical and psychological development.
For older adults, a combination of limb exercises and health‐related activities enables the
development of a comprehensive education system that further enhances conventional nursing skills
and yields improvements in physical status, cognitive functioning and overall health quality. This
type of intervention enables the development of training programmes from diverse perspectives (e.g.,
physical skills, cognition, behaviour and emotions) and the incorporation of numerous scientific
subjects, including physical education, psychology, physiology and nutrition.
Limb exercise training is a scientific approach in which nursing personnel are provided with
pre‐service training in the aspects of caring for older adults and integrating physical activities with
health education. Nursing personnel who participate in this pre‐service training must then apply the
newly acquired training methods. Moreover, the inclusion of whole‐body physical activities has
increased the flexibility and creativity of these training methods. Although previous studies have not
proposed alternative limb exercise training with the intent to improve the MCI conditions of older
adults, our results suggest that nursing homes should continue to incorporate these limb exercises
experimentally in combination with other physical activities intended to improve the PS of patients
with MCI.
5. Conclusions
This study compared the outcomes of an intervention group of 20 patients with MCI who
completed a 10‐week limb exercise training programme and a control group of 21 patients who only

Brain Sci. 2019, 9, 277

20 of 21

received health education manuals. A baseline analysis of the 41 research subjects revealed a
significant correlation between the PS, an effective indicator of cognitive impairment, and the level
of cognition in the subject population. After a 10‐week intervention, patients in the intervention
group exhibited improvements in PS and cognition level relative to their conditions before the
intervention. Compared with their counterparts in the control group, the patients in the intervention
group exhibited more significant improvements in their FTT, PPT and MoCA total and dimension
scores. Moreover, the patients in the intervention group exhibited significantly greater increases in
the alpha and beta EEG wave power values in all brain areas, suggesting that limb exercise training
had a positive effect on brain function. In summary, the limb exercise training intervention induced
significant improvements in the PS of the patients with MCI while mitigating a decline in their
cognitive function. Therefore, the limb exercise training intervention appears to be effective for
community‐dwelling patients with MCI.
