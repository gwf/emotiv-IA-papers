Abstract

An efficient Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is designed and implemented to allow disabled people to control
the motion of wheelchairs. It uses a compact portable EEG sensor to capture 14 brain signals and wirelessly feed them to the
PC. Four classes of motions are used: Forward, Backward, Left, and Right. The signals are obtained in a free-style manner
without compelling users to perform pre-defined mental operations. This led to variations in the results that shed some light
on the cognitive aspect of the problem. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Sub-Band Powers obtained from the
Wavelet Transform are used to reduce the signal dimensionality from nearly 14000 to only 3. A Feed-Forward Neural
Network with Back Propagation is used as a classifier. The average classification rate is 91 % on the overall and as high as
97.5 % for some users. The effect of mother wavelet type and user dependence are also investigated.

1. Introduction
Recent advances in technology have made it possible for
severely handicapped people to act on their surrounding
environment without the normal muscle and nerves
pathways. Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems make it
possible for such disabled people to activate devices such as
wheelchairs merely by their thoughts. BCI systems rely on
the weak Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals that were first
recorded by Berger in 1924[1]. These are generated at the
surface of the scull as a result of the neural activity and are
picked up by appropriately placed non-invasive electrodes.
Since its first introduction by Vidal in 1973[2], BCI has
received considerable attention over the last two decades
[3-8]. Numerous research efforts have been deployed in an
attempt to translate intentions and thoughts into real actions.
Some of this work used the effect of facial gestures on
EEG signals as a communication means with the outside
world[9-11]. While such approaches may work with some
users, they may not be acceptable for severely disabled
people. In the context of our work, we are interested in BCI
systems that rely on mere thoughts without any artifacts.
BCI systems have been used in several applications such
as cursor control[12], spelling and teletyping[13], answering
questions[14], and composing music[15]. An important
application of BCI is to assist severely disabled people in
controlling the motion of wheelchairs as this offers them

valuable autonomous mobility[16-22]. In such systems, the
users are usually required to perform one of several mental
tasks such as movement imagination, geometric figure
visualization, arithmetic operations, etc. These mental tasks
are mapped into the various wheelchair motions directions.
Classification is carried out in the usual way of extracting
features form the EEG signals and then applying one of
several classifiers to the feature vector. While some
researchers used a time-series prediction approach and
derived the features from the power of the predicted EEG
signals[23], most others resorted to the wavelet transform
[24-28]. The coefficients of the details resulting from the
wavelet transform are used as features. The justification for
using the wavelet transform is that it leads to a sub-band
decomposition of the signal in hand. This naturally matches
the fact that EEG signals are divided into five frequency
bands that take on different power levels depending on the
mental state. This is shown in Table 1.

Several classifiers were used by researchers such as Linear
Discriminants (LD)[23], Bayesian[29], Hidden Markov
Model (HMM)[30], Support Vector Machine (SVM)[31],
and Neural Networks[19, 32,33].
The more recent work on BCI for wheelchair includes that

of Lin and Yang[20]. The eye blinking artifact is not
removed but utilized to control the motion of the wheelchair.
Carlson and Millan[21] use motor imagery to feed a
Gaussian classifier. Fattouh et. al.[22] use the AffectivTM
Suite of Emotiv to detect emotion changes in order to control
the wheelchair.
The most related work to ours is that of Vijay Khare
et. al.[19]. They reported a real time BCI system that uses 8
brain sensors from a medical stationary EEG sensor. They
used the Wavelet Packet Transform along with a Radial
Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN). Their feature
vector uses 21 detail coefficients. They reported a perfect
classification rate[19].
In this work, we designed, implemented, and tested an
efficient BCI system for wheelchair control. Even though
our work carries some similarities with that of Khare et. al., it
differs with the following contributions:
● We allow users to record their thoughts in a
free-style manner without having to perform any given
mental exercises that not all may be able to go through.
Instead, each user is given the freedom to imagine the four
motions of the wheel chair in an independent way. Even
though this has made the recorded EEG signals less
clustered hence harder to classify, it simplified the system
use. In addition, it led to interesting variations in the
results that shed some light on people’s perception of
directions amongst other things.
● A considerable simulation and testing effort was
deployed to investigate the issue of feature selection.
Inspired by the effect of mental state on the EEG
sub-frequency bands powers, we used the average power
of the details coefficients (corresponding to sub-band
powers in the EEG signal), as features. We were able to
reduce the signal dimensionality to only 3, resulting in a
considerable speed-up of the BCI system training and
testing time.
● Our BCI system is compact and portable thanks to
its wireless light weight headset. This allows maximum
mobility for the users.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
section 2, we summarize the details of the signal
measurement and data collection. In section 3, we provide
the details of the overall BCI system, including the signal
processing, feature selection, and input classification. In
section 4, we summarize the performance assessment of our
BCI system. A brief discussion of the mother wavelet effect,
user dependence, and some cognitive aspects of the problem
are also provided. Finally, in Section 5, we summarize and
conclude our work.

sensors are applied to the scull surface using a saline
solution and follow the 10-20 international standard.
Nick-named “EPOC”, the headset uses a 128 Hz sampling
rate with a 14 bit A/D resolution. It has a built-in fifth order
sinc filter that cuts frequencies above 64 Hz. In addition,
two notch filters suppress the 50/60 Hz interferences caused
by the power lines. The EPOC has a 12-hr battery life and
weighs around 7 Ounces. It comes in different packages
including the CognitivTM Suite and AffectivTM Suite that
provide ready packages for EEG analysis without direct
access to the EEG signals. In our work, we used the more
expensive Development Kit that allowed us to store and
handle the EEG signals. Figs. 1-3 respectively show the
headset, its sensor locations, and a sample of the picked-up
signals. All channels are wirelessly transmitted to a USB
module in the PC via a proprietary encoding/modulation on
a 2.4GHz carrier.

It is known that various artifacts such as facial movements
and eye blinks result in large spikes in the EEG signals. For
example, Fig 4 shows the picked-up EEG signals with three
eye blinks at the end.
In order to limit the operation of our BCI system to brain
thoughts only, we recorded all data without any such artifacts
by asking the users not to make any facial gestures including
eye blinks. Three volunteers participated in the data
collection: User1 is a female student (age 23, left-handed),
User2 is another female student (age 23, right-handed), and
User3 is a male adult (age 50, right-handed). All subjects

were normal in the sense they had no disability. The intent
was to collect data from some handicapped people, but this
was not possible at the time of preparation of this initial work.
Each subject recorded a total of 100 samples for each of the
four motions: Forward, Backward, Right, and Left. The
recording was carried out at different time intervals and
mental conditions. Each recording was about eight-secondslong during which the user is asked to relax with eyes open
and think of one of the four directions. Ten of the 100
recordings were used for testing purposes and the remaining
90 for training the classifier.

Based on previous reports[19], it was clear that 14
sensors were more than needed for this problem. Hence, the
first intent was to reduce the redundancy in the EEG signals.
PCA was used for this purpose. Each measurement was
organized in a matrix of size 14 by 999. Let Xik be such a
matrix corresponding to measurement “i" (i = 1,…90) of
class “k” (k = 1,…4). After making Xik zero mean, The 14
by 14 covariance matrix Ck of class “k” is obtained by

𝑪𝑪𝑘𝑘 = 𝑷𝑷𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 𝚲𝚲𝑘𝑘 𝑷𝑷𝑘𝑘

Where “ ” denotes the transpose operations and the
expected value is carried out by averaging over the 90
measurements. Next, an Eigen analysis is performed on Ck
to yield
Where the 14 by 14 unitarian matrix Pk is made up of the
fourteen eigenvectors as its rows, and 𝚲𝚲𝑘𝑘 is a diagonal
matrix made up of the 14 eigenvalues (all non negative)
arranged in descending order of magnitude.
The data redundancy is removed by keeping only the “m”
largest eigenvalues and neglecting the smaller ones along
with their eigenvectors. Let 𝑷𝑷𝑚𝑚
𝑘𝑘 denote the “m” by 14
reduced eigenvector matrix obtained by keeping the “m”
eigenvectors (rows) corresponding to the largest “m”
eignvalues. The reduced data matrix 𝑿𝑿𝑚𝑚

is obtained by

%Mean Square Error

The choice of “m” is rather subjective. Fig. 6 shows the
mean squared error between Xik and 𝑿𝑿𝑚𝑚

classes and measurements for various values of m.

𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 versus the number of
“m” largest eigenvalues taken

It can be seen from Fig. 6 that keeping the 6 or 7 largest
eigenvalues is a good compromise between reducing the
problem dimensionality and loss of data. A rough initial
classification using the K Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
showed that after the 7th eigenvlue, little effect on the
performance is obtained. Hence, it was decided to reduce the
problem dimensionality to 999 by 7 only. This is equivalent
to saying that 7 of the 14 signals picked-up may be omitted
without considerable loss of performance. This is in
agreement with the previous results that use only an
eight-signal EEG system[19].

37

Next, the reduced EEG signal is concatenated into a 999*7
vector onto which a wavelet transform is applied. In an effort
to find a closer matching wavelet to the EEG signal in hand,
different types of mother wavelets have been tested. A
five-level decomposition is used leading to details d1-d5 and
approximation a5. These five levels conveniently map to the
5 frequency sub-bands of EEG signals shown in Table 1.
Taking into account the sampling rate of 128 Hz, this
important mapping is shown in Table 2 below.
It is known that the Beta band is the most dominant during
problem solving. Hence, we expect that “d2” to be the focus
of the feature vector as it contains the most discriminatory
information for this current application. Since the users
record the data in a meditation-like session, we also expect
the Alpha and Theta (corresponding to d3 and d4
respectively) to be of importance. This observation shall be
validated by the experimental testing in the next section.

Previous approaches use the coefficients of the wavelet
transform as features. For example Vijay Khare et. al. use 21
of the wavelet coefficients as input to the NN classifier. In
our work, the average power in each sub-band (the mean of
the squared terms of a1 and d1-d5) is calculated and used as a
feature candidate. This is motivated by the argument stated
above related to the variations of the power in the EEG
sub-bands due to various mental states. As shall be shown in
the next section, extensive testing narrowed down the feature
vector to size 3, resulting in a considerable speedup of the
BCI system’s training and testing. Finally, using National
Instrument’s data card, the decision of the classifier is output
as one of four bits (using the USB as a virtual parallel port of
the laptop PC). Hence, our BCI system provides direct
switching to the wheelchair motors via relays. For testing
purposes, we connect the four bits to four LEDs.

4. Results
In order to find an optimum feature vector, we performed
an extensive testing using the average powers of the details
and approximation of the wavelet transform. In this we were
guided by the a-priori expectations that d2 should be our
focus. Table 3 shows the overall classification results for
different feature vector sizes using dB5 as mother wavelet.
The three-point vector made up of the average powers of
d2, d3, and d4 led to the best overall classification rate, hence
shall be used in what follows. This corresponds to the
average powers of the beta, alpha, and delta bands.

It is a fact that the degree of correlation between the
wavelet and the signal in hand has an effect on the
decomposition coefficients. Hence, our BCI system was
tested using different types of mother wavelets. The results
are summarized in Fig. 7. Even though the effect of the
wavelet type was not very pronounced, dB5 seemed to lead
to the best results hence was adopted in all the subsequent
testing. Fig. 8 summarizes the overall classification rate for
the four directions. It can be observed that the Forward
direction is the most favorable. This observation was
consistent in all the testing we performed. With the human
senses naturally geared forward, it is expected that people
tend to perceive the forward direction easiest. In addition, it
may be favored because it is generally related to an
optimistic and progressive perception of life events.

Due to the free-style data collection in our work, we left

expected the performance to vary from one user to another.
Figs. 9-11 depict the classification rate for each user. As can
be seen, user 2 seems to have the most “consistent” way of
perceiving the four directions and led to the highest
classification rate of 97.5%, while it is 85% and 90% for
