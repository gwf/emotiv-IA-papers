Abstract
This research investigated the effects of violent and football video games on the cognitive
functions, cortisol level, and brain waves. A total of 64 participants were competed in a singleelimination tournament. Saliva samples of all players were obtained before and after games for
the assessment of cortisol levels. The cognitive performances of player were also assessed by
PASAT cognitive test. Moreover, EEG recording was conducted during the games. Analysis
showed that salivary cortisol levels were significantly decreased after playing both games. In
addition, football game increased reaction time, while decreased sustained attention and mental
fatigue. Conversely, following violent game, the reaction time was decreased and sustained
attention and mental fatigue were increased. Furthermore, the results of EEG recording revealed
that violent game engaged more brain regions than football game. In conclusion, violent game
more effectively improved cognitive performances in the players than football game.

Introduction
Nowadays, video games are not only the means of entertainment and relaxing, but also form one
of the biggest industries in the world of information and communication technology(Newman,
2015). Publicity of video game contents is increasing and there is a high tendency toward video
games in almost all children and adolescents(Lenhart et al., 2008).
A grow body of evidence showed that video games can improve life skills such as problemsolving, learning and memory, attention, decision-making, and self-confidence (Green and
Bavelier, 2003; Aliyari et al., 2015). However, adverse effects of video games can lead toan
inability to acquire personal and social life skills and may result in psychological disorder
including stress and depression (Anderson et al., 2010). In addition, the type of video games can
differently influence the audience. Recent studies have indicated that complicated, serious,
strategic, and action games improve communications between different brain regions, especially
the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, and optic tracts (Spook et al., 2016; Anderson,
2004; Bisoglio et al., 2014; Buelow et al., 2015). It has also been shown that playing violent
video games increases hostility and aggressive behaviors in the players(Hollingdale and
Greitemeyer, 2013; Anderson and Carnagey, 2009). Moreover, it has been shown that several
video games through continuous stimulation of the stress system, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis influence the brain functions such as memory and decision-making (Lupien et al.,
2005; Lupien and Lepage, 2001). Several studies have also reported that video games result in
arousal and physiological reactions including increased heartbeat, blood pressure,and blood flow
to muscles, as well as increased breathing responses (Hébert et al., 2005; Segal and Dietz, 1991;
Wang and Perry, 2006).

Recording of the brain wave patterns by an electroencephalogram (EEG) is increasingly used by
researchers in different areas as a conventional approach to assess the brain signals variations
(Wehbe and Nacke, 2013; Aliyari et al., 2017). The EEG signal provides online and real-time
information about the brain status and activity (Mullen et al., 2015). In addition, this method is
currently used for cognitive state monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and therapeutics(Fairclough,
2009; Debener et al., 2012).
In the presentstudy, we investigated the effects of different styles of video games, violent game
and football game, on cognitive performance, hormonal change, and the brain activity during
continuous playing the games using EEG in the players.
Methods
Participants
A total of 64 volunteer male participants (32 per each game) were registered and screened
through an invitation for under graduatesstudents aged between 20-25 years. All participants had
not played the game formerly. A research questionnaire which covered personal information,
favorite games, game types, and the average time spent playing during a day were completed by
the participants. In the beginning, players completed a form covering their personal information
and were given the instructions to play each game before starting the game. All ethical
considerations were met in the maintenance and working with the human subjects and prior to
data collection an informed consent was obtained from each participant. This research carried out
according to a certain code (ir.bmsu. rec. 1394. 112) of ethical rules.
Cortisol Assay

6

Saliva samples of all players were obtained before and after the games to measure the levels of
cortisol. Salivary cortisol was measured using human cortisol enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) kits (Diagnostics Biochem Canada Inc, dbc).
PASAT Assay
The PASAT cognitive test was also conducted before and after the game to assess the cognitive
performance of the participants and analyzed in PASAT software. In this test, 61 random
numbers between 1 and 9 were presented to the subjects with 3-second intervals. The respondent
had to sum every two consecutive final numbers and answer the question before a new number
was announced. For instance, if numbers 2 and 6 were announced in the mentioned order, the
respondent’s correct answer should be 8. The answers to questions were compared before and
after playing the game. The mean time to respond (reaction time), the longest chain of correct
answers (sustained attention), and the longest chain of wrong answers (mental fatigue) were also
evaluated in this research.
EEG recording
Data Collection
In this study, EEG data were collected from 64 male participants. The participants were healthy
with no history of mental disease and the average age of 20-25 years. For data collection, we
used Emotiv EPOC headset, a recently developed wireless EEG acquisition device. The device
had 14 electrodes located and labeled according to the international 10-20 system. The device
further consisted of two reference electrodes for noise reduction. The available electrode
positions for the device wereas follows: AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC5, F4, F8,

7

and AF4. The EEG datawas transmitted wirelessly to the Bluetooth device and saved on the hard
disk for further processes.
Data Classification
In order to determine the type of the games the participants played from the EEG data, we
assessed two well-studied features: arousal and valence. These features have been used in the
context of emotion detection and proven to be useful in the emotion recognition (Choppin,
2000). Arousal refers to the state of excitability of a person and indicates whether the subject is
alert or relaxed. On the other hand, affective valence indicates the positive or negative state of
the mind. According to Ramirez & Vamvakousis study(Ramirez and Vamvakousis, 2012), we
used following relations to extract arousal and valence features from the EEG data:

In which α and β indicate the power of the signal in alpha (8-12Hz) and beta (12-30Hz) bands,
associated with the electrodes denoted by subscripts.
To obtain the power of signals in the specific bands of interests, initially, we pre-processed the
EEG signals. The main source of artifacts was mostly due to the eye blinks/movements,
heartbeats, muscle activities, and power line noise. By referencing the EEG signals and
exploiting a band-pass filter, the power of the signals in alpha and beta bands were extracted and
the artifacts components were mainly removed. The level of arousal and valence in participants
were determined using the power of EEG signals for specified electrodes in the alpha and beta
bands.
8

The EEG signal was acquired by a sampling frequency of 128Hz. To analyze the EEG data, we
apply a temporal window on the EEG signals and shift it every 0.0625 seconds. Therefore, each
data point corresponds to the power of the signal in alpha and beta bands at the time interval of
[t,t+1] seconds for all channels and the next data points were generated with specific increments
of t. The incrementsof t should be small enough to capture fast dynamics of the brain activity.
For this matter, we used increments of 0.0625 seconds.
In the present study, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was used to discriminate the
specific video-games (tasks) that the participants played. We utilized statistics toolbox in
MATLAB and specifically SVM learning algorithms to implement the SVM classifier.
Data Analysis
Data was expressed as mean  standard error of means (Mean  SEM) and analyzed with SPSS
software. The paired sample t-test analysiswas used to determine the difference between before
and after playing the games. In addition, p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Salivary Cortisol
The resultsshowed that playing the football video game significantly(p<0.05) decreased cortisol
concentration as compared to before playing the game. However, after playing violent gameno
significant differencein salivary cortisol was observed as compared to before the game (Fig. 1).

Reaction time
Our results also showed that the mean time spent to answer reaction time of the players after
playing football game was increased (p<0.05) indicating increased reaction time. However, a
considerable decrease was observed in the reaction time of participants playing violent game
demonstrating a high speed of response (Fig. 3).

Sustained attention
We also found that playing football game slightly increased sustained attention (the longest chain
of correct answers) of the participants as compared to the pre-playing status. However, sustained
attention of violent game players was slightly decreased after playing (Fig. 4).

Mental fatigue
The result of paired t-test analysis revealed that mental fatigue (the longest chain of wrong
answers) was slightly decreased in the players offootball video game, whereas this indicator was
slightly increased in the participants who played violent game (Fig. 5).

Brain mapping
Given arousal and valence as main features, the average accuracy of the classifier was 78.76%.
Since the training data consists of nearly equal data points of each class, the expected accuracy
of a naïve classifier was 50%. The training data, support vectors, as well as the boundary of
margin are depicted in Fig. 6.

illustrates the boundary of margin which the data is classified. Please note that the data

dispersion for two classes exhibits a clear distinction between two classes, i.e. football and
violent games data.
Selecting other sets of features may result in better classifiers. Arousal and valence represent a
β

family of features that exploit ratio of the power of distinct bands, e.g. α. We used other feature
candidates that may result in better classification accuracies. In the Table 1, the accuracies of
classifiers for different feature sets have been summarized. Each vector comprises power of
alpha and beta bands of the same electrode, e.g. (αAF4 , βAF4 ) . The result of this analysis
demonstrated that (αF4 , βF4 ), (αAF3 , βAF3 ), (αFC6 , βFC6 ), (αAF4 , βAF4 ) feature vectors offer
classifiers with the accuracy of 88%, 87%, 84%, and 83%, respectively.

Furthermore, we used sole alpha and beta band powers to assess the detect ability of the tasks
according to the level of relaxation and alertness, respectively. The logic behind this feature
selection was the fact that alpha activity is associated with relaxed state of mind and is more
prominent in the occipital and parietal lobes. On the other hand, beta activity is associated with
alertness and active mental state and is predominantly observed in the frontal cortex. To this aim,
trained SVM classifiers with two sets of features(αi , αj ) and (βi , βj ) in which i and jare subscripts

Discussion
The results of the present study revealed a significant decrease in the stress hormone, cortisol
levels, after playing football and violent games. Moreover, playing football game increased
response speed and decreased sustained attention and the number of wrong answers as a marker
of mental fatigue. However, the violent game reduced reaction time and increased sustained
attention and mental fatigue. Furthermore, EEG recording demonstrated that violent game
involved more brain regions than football game.
According to the previous studies, different types of video games significantly improve cognitive
functions of the players in the long run(Gray, 2015; Spence and Feng, 2010). It has been proven
that video games are included different forms of active learning. In other words, logical problem
statement or problem-solving methods train and activate the central nervous system and improve
cognitive functions more effectively than passive learning methods (Bisoglio et al., 2014).
Moreover, learning takes different concurrent forms, which exponentially reinforce cognitive
functions (Basile and Hampton, 2013). Most video games offer a dynamic level of difficulty,
which not only increases the player’s skills but also constantly challenges the player. Video
games use a combination of internal boosters (e.g. positive social interactions and feelings) and
external forces (e.g. scores and medals). These motivational forces are precisely embedded in
games and are accessed at different times on certain gradients to attract and encourage the
audience to continue the game (Baddeley and Longman, 1978). Video games also constantly
keep the brain’s reward system active, resulting in increased brain flexibility (Bao et al., 2001;

17

Kilgard and Merzenich, 1998). Numerous studies have examined the positive effects of action
games on the brain functions and almost all of these studies suggested that these games improve
the brain functions including contrast sensitivity, vision and power of vision (Green and
Bavelier, 2007), peripheral vision (Buckley et al., 2010), time processing (Donohue et al., 2010),
and many others. In the present study, results of comparing violent and football games revealed
that these two games have a different effect on cognitive function of the participants.
Stress can disturb several cognitive factors such as memory, learning, attention, and
concentration (Pechtel and Pizzagalli, 2011; Sandi and Pinelo-Nava, 2007). Cortisol is the most
important hormone secreted by human adrenal gland in response to stress. When the brain
considers a factor as a threat (a stress factor), the amygdala and hypothalamus are activated
resulting incorticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
release (Keegan et al., 2007). Due to the fat-soluble nature of cortisol, it easily flows in the
saliva. Therefore, salivary cortisol and its variations can be used as a measure of changes of
plasma cortisol and activity of the HPA axis and the adrenal gland (Smeets et al., 2008; Kazemi
et al., 2017). In addition, the adrenal-sympathetic stress axis, the second stress response axis,
stimulates the sympathetic system and increases the secretion of noradrenalin(Chrousos, 2009;
Feinstein et al., 2011). Previous studies found that salivary cortisol decreased after playing the
games, which reflects tranquility of the players during the games. In this study, comparison of
the effects of violent game and football game on the players indicated that salivary cortisol
decreased after playing these games (Fig. 1). It seems that as a result of the game arrangement,
players were highly concentrated on the accuracy of the game and the attention of gamers was
increased. Hence, playing-induced emotions were suppressed in the gamers and the activity of
stress systems are subsided(Feinstein et al., 2011).
18

PASAT is commonly used as a research software for examining the natural cognitive activity of
the brain(Aliyari et al., 2015). It was used for the first time by the American army to assess the
cognitive readiness of soldiers who survived blasts (Tombaugh, 2006). Results of various studies
have revealed the ability of this test to assess cognitive factors including sustained attention,
working memory, dual processing, information processing speed, speed of digit retrieval, speed
of mathematical facts retrieval, and time components(Aliyari et al., 2015; Tombaugh, 2006).In
this research, PASAT test also revealed the positive effects of football and violent games on
cognitive function of the participants, and the mental health of the players was improved by
playing both games (Fig. 2). Baniqued et al. (2014) found the positive effects of casual video
games and demonstrated that casual games can improve cognitive functions (Baniqued et al.,
2014). In a study by Nouchi et al. the effects of two extremely popular games, the Brain Age
game (Nintendo Co. Ltd) and puzzle game called Tetris (Nintendo),on 8 major cognitive
functions of the brain including short-term memory, working memory, executive functions, fluid
intelligence, attention, processing speed, visual ability, and reading ability, were studied. Their
findings revealed that Brain age game was related to improved executive functions, working
memory, and processing time in young participants, whereas the puzzle game improved attention
and spatial visual abilities of the players (Nouchi et al., 2013). In our study, PASAT test revealed
that football and violent games had different effects on reaction time of the participants.
Although football increased reaction time, sustained attention, and mental fatigue of the players,
violent game reduced these factors following the game. It seems that being in the presence of
stress deteriorates capability of the brain to collect exact and acceptable answers and disrupts
memory resulting in increased the numbers of wrong answers(Lupien et al., 2005; Maheu et al.,
2005).

19

Previous studies demonstrated that frontal lobe largely involves in the processing of attention
and executive functions and playing video games can facilitate its function (Stuss and Alexander,
2000; Smith and Jonides, 1999). Several studies used EGG recording to explore brain activity
during different computer games (He et al., 2008; Bakaoukas et al., 2016). In the current study,
SVM classifiers were used to classify EEG signals based on various spectral features. All of the
proposed features contributed to a significant accuracy in the classification of the EEG signals.
Among these feature families, paired alpha band features resulted in most accurate classifiers and
suggested a variety of features with significantly accurate classifiers. Moreover, paired beta band
features presented classifiers with proper performance, even though the results were not as good
as previous feature family. Interestingly, the best performance of classifiers occurred in frontal
channels (AF3, AF4, FC6, and F4 for paired alpha band features and AF3, F7, FC5, and F4 for
paired beta band features). It seems that these two games provoked distinct cognitive demands
which in turn reflected differently in the EEG recordings suggesting that cognitive signatures of
games may be detectable in EEG signals. Another exciting fact about these families of features
was the fact that the alertness or relaxation state of the mind isa reliable candidate to train
accurate classifiers(Aliyari et al., 2017; Aliyari et al., 2018). In this case, the paired alpha band
features lead to more accurate and robust results, suggesting that the relaxation pattern predicts
type ofthe tasks more accurately. Further research is needed to validate the latter prediction
behaviorally. Furthermore, F4 channel is an electrode that presents reliable features both in alpha
and beta bands proposing the potential of this channel in assessing cognitive task using EEG
signals more precisely. The (α, β) pairs also offer dependable features in the frontal channels
especially in AF3, FC6, F4, and AF4 channels. Again, F4 feature presentsignificant potential in
the precise classification of EEG signals. Additionally, arousal and valence features illustrated

20

acceptable classification accuracy, but less than previous features; however, their significance
was due to the fact that these features are more indifferent from subjects to other subjects. Due to
the difference in electrode installation and skin impedance, EEG signals may differ in amplitude
and frequency content and different levels of signal to noise ratio. This may make former
features useless because due to individual difference and the signals may be already distinct
enough hence the difference in EEG pattern would not be a matter(Aliyari et al., 2017; Aliyari et
al., 2018). On the other hand, ratio features like arousal and valence could resolve this problem,
since they are normalized and hence more indifferent between subjects. It is important to take
this problem into our consideration when working with specific scenarios depending on our
specific application.
Conclusion
Our data indicated that football and violent games decreased salivary cortisol levels. However,
these two games had different effects on cognitive performance of the players. Response speed,
sustained attention, and mental fatigue were increased by playing football game, whereas these
factors were decreased after playing violent game. Moreover, we found that spontaneous brain
activity was changed in response to video games. These positive and negative effects show the
necessity of further research, further investment, and proper policies which may result in more
