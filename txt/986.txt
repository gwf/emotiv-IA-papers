Information foraging connects optimal foraging theory in ecology with how humans
search for information. The theory suggests that, following an information scent, the
information seeker must optimize the tradeoff between exploration by repeated steps in
the search space vs. exploitation, using the resources encountered. We conjecture that
this tradeoff characterizes how a user deals with uncertainty and its two aspects, risk and
ambiguity in economic theory. Risk is related to the perceived quality of the actually visited
patch of information, and can be reduced by exploiting and understanding the patch to a
better extent. Ambiguity, on the other hand, is the opportunity cost of having higher quality
patches elsewhere in the search space. The aforementioned tradeoff depends on many
attributes, including traits of the user: at the two extreme ends of the spectrum, analytic
and wholistic searchers employ entirely different strategies. The former type focuses on
exploitation ﬁrst, interspersed with bouts of exploration, whereas the latter type prefers to
explore the search space ﬁrst and consume later. Our ﬁndings from an eye-tracking study
of experts’ interactions with novel search interfaces in the biomedical domain suggest
that user traits of cognitive styles and perceived search task difﬁculty are signiﬁcantly
correlated with eye gaze and search behavior. We also demonstrate that perceived risk
shifts the balance between exploration and exploitation in either type of users, tilting it
against vs. in favor of ambiguity minimization. Since the pattern of behavior in information
foraging is quintessentially sequential, risk and ambiguity minimization cannot happen
simultaneously, leading to a fundamental limit on how good such a tradeoff can be. This
in turn connects information seeking with the emergent ﬁeld of quantum decision theory.

1. INTRODUCTION
Foraging is a common pattern of behavior: humans and animals share dedicated cognitive
mechanisms to ﬁnd resources in the environment. Amenities such as food are distributed in
spatially localized patches where the task is to maximize one’s intake, that is, knowing when to
exploit a local patch vs. when it is time to move on and explore one’s broader surroundings.

Risk and Ambiguity in Information Seeking

In humans, the underlying neuropsychological mechanisms
result in cognitive searches, such as recalling words from
memory (Hills et al., 2012, 2015). As part of users’ information
seeking behavior, the concept of information foraging describes
the above quest by a similar strategy (Pirolli and Card, 1999).
Key to the understanding of decisions by a consumer of
information is that they are subject to uncertainty: his or her
knowledge of the environment is incomplete, so the resulting
decisions must go back to perceptions and certain heuristics. By
turning to classical works in economy, we can identify two facets
of this uncertainty, namely risk and ambiguity (Knight, 1921;
Ellsberg, 1961). Their interpretation according to the foraging
scenario is in place here.
Brieﬂy, risk is the quality of the current patch and our
fragmented perception of it. Is the place of good quality? Should
one stay here or move on? Since we are already at the preselected
location, we do have prior information about it. A riskminimizing behavior will favor exploitation over exploration,
staying longer at individual locations, potentially losing out if
outstanding patches remain unvisited.
The above immediately have anthropological overtones.
Foraging behavior seems to apply to a much larger domain than
just looking for food, such as the optimization of upper and
lower extremities of pleasure and pain, gain and loss, beneﬁt and
cost, reward and punishment, joy and sorrow. Seeking one while
avoiding the other is the subject of risk analysis, where the nature
of risk is hesitation. It is obvious that if we are too quick or
too slow, we lose a positive option by gaining a negative score
somewhere else without even having noticed.
Ambiguity, on the other hand, is related to opportunity cost,
the price of not foraging elsewhere. “Elsewhere” refers to the
rest of the unknown distribution which is not observed at the
moment. A human forager who wants to reduce ambiguity ﬁrst
will jump around diﬀerent patches and explore more, learning
as much as possible about the information distribution while
reducing the associated uncertainty. This behavior will not stop
at the ﬁrst good enough patch.
To continue the anthropological implications, ambiguity
would also mean that all of the above are the essence of situations,
of problem solving in general, but any decision we make (and
the crucial belief that thereby we have resolved the problem)
results in a new situation by trying to escape one. So in a
sense, risk would belong to the surface layer and ambiguity to
the deep layer of any decision situation. If the above hold, we
could identify many more scenarios relevant from psychology to
decision theory and from cognitive science to the stock exchange.
Resonating with the aforementioned, our working hypothesis
below will be that if animal foraging is subject to uncertainty,
and information seeking is an essentially identical activity in a
diﬀerent context, then a limit to simultaneous risk and ambiguity
minimization must apply to information foraging as well. This
limit emerges from the sequential and incompatible nature of
the decisions made to minimize these two aspects of uncertainty.
The incompatible decisions are similar to measurements in
quantum mechanics where they give rise to the uncertainty
principle; thus our work connects information foraging and
information seeking behavior to the thriving ﬁeld of quantum

decision theory (Yukalov and Sornette, 2008; Bruza et al., 2009;
Khrennikov, 2010; Busemeyer and Bruza, 2012; Ashtiani and
Azgomi, 2015). We will demonstrate our point on eye tracking
studies data in our analysis of user interactions with novel search
interfaces for biomedical information search.
After an overview of the origins and application areas of
uncertainty, we provide background information regarding the
concept and its relationship with foraging decisions, and the
connections between information foraging and information
seeking. A user experiment with eye trackers in the context of
information search is oﬀered to demonstrate uncertainty as a
composite of risk and ambiguity. The eye gaze patterns exhibited
by users with diﬀerent cognitive styles and their search behavior
are discussed, and future research is provided.

2. BACKGROUND
2.1. The Origins and Application Areas of
Uncertainty
A decision in the presence of uncertainty means that the
outcome cannot be fully predicted before the decision is made.
Multiple possible outcomes can occur, and our knowledge of the
probability distribution only allows for a limited characterization
of uncertainty. Following Knight (1921), Ellsberg (1961), and
Camerer and Weber (1992), we can distinguish between two
fundamental aspects of uncertainty, aforementioned ambiguity
and risk. The simple deﬁnition of risk is uncertainty with known
probabilities, a certain a priori probability for a given outcome.
Ambiguity is also probabilistic but less well deﬁned, generally
associated with events that the decision maker has even less
information about than the risk of outcomes. The two aspects are
also called expected and unexpected uncertainty. Dealing with
unexpected uncertainty involves a more subjective evaluation
of probabilities. In the case of ambiguity, less information is
available, and expected utility is harder to estimate. Not knowing
crucial information, such as the probability distribution of the
outcomes, is a frightening prospect which explains why most
people are ambiguity-averse (Ellsberg, 1961). The two forms of
uncertainty are so diﬀerent that dealing with risk and ambiguity
are supported by distinct neural mechanisms in humans (Huettel
et al., 2006).
Apart from this probabilistic nature of decisions in an
uncertain environment, there is an even deeper form of
uncertainty: the kind we normally refer to in the context of
quantum mechanics. Some measurements on a quantum system
are simply incompatible: measuring one aspect of the system
prevents us from learning more about another aspect thereof,
explored by a diﬀerent measurement—this is known as the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle (Heisenberg, 1927). Using the
formalism of quantum mechanics in decision theory is not
novel either: recently there has been a surge of interest in this
topic (Bruza et al., 2009; Khrennikov, 2010; Busemeyer and
Bruza, 2012; Wittek et al., 2013).

2.2. Uncertainty and Foraging Decisions
We are especially interested in how risk and ambiguity appear
in sequential decisions. Simultaneous or coordinated decision

Risk and Ambiguity in Information Seeking

The information foraging nature of the data was recognized
by eye tracking analysis, based on the concept of information
scent, operationalized as “the proportion of participants who
correctly identiﬁed the location of the task answer from looking
at upper branches in the tree” in a study of user interactions with
visualization of large tree structures (Pirolli et al., 2000). Pirolli
et al. (2001) provided further theoretical accounts for scanpaths
from cognitive perspectives in which users were able to ﬁnd
information more quickly when strong information scent was
detected. Chi et al. (2001) built a computational model for user
information needs and search behavior based on information
scent, and the model and algorithm were evaluated by simulated
studies. More recently, the modeling of user search behavior
using eye tracking techniques has focused on levels of domain
knowledge, user interests, types of search task and relevance
judgments in search processes (Cole et al., 2010, 2013; Gwizdka,
2014; Vakkari et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). However, there is
still limited understanding of the eﬀect of individual diﬀerences
and user perceptions of search tasks on eye gaze patterns
in information search. White (2016a,b) provided a review of
information foraging and user interactions with search systems.
The eye gaze patterns, an indicator of user attention and
cognitive processes have been extensively studied for designing
user interfaces, such as the functional grouping of interface
menu (Goldberg and Kotval, 1999; Brumby and Zhuang, 2015),
faceted search interface (Kules et al., 2009; Kemman et al.,
2013) and comparison of interface layouts (Kammerer and
Gerjets, 2012). Information retrieval researchers have been
concerned with users’ attention to the ranking position of
documents and diﬀerent components of search engine results
page (SERP) (Cutrell and Guan, 2007; Lorigo et al., 2008; Dumais
et al., 2010; Savenkov et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2016). These studies
generally suggest that there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in users’
eye gaze patterns on comparisons of search interface layouts, and
users’ attention to elements of interfaces depends on the length
and quality of snippets on SERPs, as well as the displayed position
of search results.

making, on the other hand, is more complex, being less common
among animals because it involves comparative evaluation.
Pointing at a major diﬀerence between the animal kingdom
vs. man, Kolling et al. (2012) showed that humans are able to
choose between these two models in uncertain environments.
A foraging scenario is a good example of sequential decision
making: food resources are available in patches, and a forager
must ﬁnd an optimal strategy to consume the resources. There
is a cost associated with switching from one patch to another.
Uncertainty relates to the quality of the current patch, the quality
of background options—the opportunity cost of not foraging
elsewhere–, while the environment is also subject to changes.
The forager has to minimize the tradeoﬀ between exploitation
of a patch vs. exploration of background options. This pattern
is not restricted to food consumption: for instance, it pertains
to mate selection, retrieving memories, and consumer decisions.
In fact, the same neural mechanism can serve these diﬀerent
functions (Adams et al., 2012).
Optimal foraging theory establishes the strategy to follow
if the probabilities can be estimated and updated by the
forager (MacArthur and Pianka, 1966; Charnov, 1976).
Ambiguity alters the behavior: for example, unexpected forms of
uncertainty may trigger more exploration (Cohen et al., 2007).
We would like to see how ambiguity and risk can be minimized
in sequential decisions, and how that aﬀects exploration and
exploitation.
Many decisions require an exploration of alternatives before
committing to one, and exploiting the consequences thereof. This
is known as foraging in animals that face an environment in
which food resources are available in patches: the forager explores
the environment looking for high-quality patches, eventually
exploiting a few of them only. Such decisions take place in an
uncertain environment: ambiguity about the quality of patches
and the risk of not foraging at better patches force the forager to
accept a tradeoﬀ.
Risk-sensitive foraging is not exclusive to animals, human
subjects also show similar behavioral patterns (Pietras et al.,
2003; Rushworth et al., 2012). An optimal solution between
exploration and exploitation is generally not known, except
in cases with strong assumptions about both the environment
and the decision maker (Cohen et al., 2007). The tradeoﬀ
between exploration and exploitation is also known as the
partial-feedback paradigm, linking the decision model to the
description–experience gap (Hertwig and Erev, 2009): people
perceive the risk of a rare event diﬀerently if the probability
distribution is known (decision from description) vs. when they
have to rely on more uncertain information (decision from
experience).

3. USER EXPERIMENT
A user experiment was designed to investigate user eye gaze
and search behavior in biomedical search tasks, with particular
reference to diﬀerent elements of search interfaces (i.e., Medical
Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, title, authors, and abstract).
We used a 4 × 4 × 2 factorial design with four search interfaces,
controlled search topic pairs and cognitive styles. A 4 × 4 GraecoLatin square design was used (Fisher, 1935) to arrange the
experimental conditions. Each user was assigned 8 topics in total,
with a 7-min limit for each topic, and the experiment took about
90 min in total. Refer to Video S1 in the Supplementary Material
for a demonstration.
This study was carried out in accordance with the
recommendations of National Statement on Ethical Conduct in
Human Research, The National Health and Medical Research
Council, with written informed consent from all subjects. All
subjects gave written informed consent. The protocol was

2.3. Information Seeking As Foraging
To take the next step in our working hypothesis, below we
shall look at a scenario where seeking was exercised by gaze
ﬁxation at segments of user interfaces with signiﬁcant elements
of content, and show that underlying the seemingly random
walks of eye gaze on the screen, there is order in the patterned
data inasmuch as a certain typology of user behavior applies
to them.

approved by the The Science & Medical Delegated Ethics Review
Committee, The Australian National University, and the Human
Research Ethics Committee, Charles Sturt University.
A information sheet regarding the nature and procedures of
the research project was explained to the participant. A consent
form was signed with the conditions of (1) freely given consent;
(2) engagement with searching an experimental system and
collection of background information, search experiences and
individual diﬀerences, such as cognitive styles; (3) conﬁdentiality
of personal information; (4) the consent form and any other
identifying materials will be stored separately; (5) withdrawal
from the research project at any time; and (6) participation is
completely voluntary.

Interface “B” (Figure 1A) added MeSH terms to the interface.
After the user’s query was run, MeSH terms from all results
were collated; the ten most frequent were displayed at the
top of the screen. This mimics the per-query suggestions
produced by systems like ProQuest1 .
MeSH terms were introduced with “Try:” and were
clickable: if a user clicked a term, his or her query was
reﬁned to include the MeSH term and then re-run. It was
hoped that the label, and the fact they work as links, would
encourage users to interact with them.
Interface “C” (Figure 1B) used the same MeSH terms as “B” but
displayed them alongside each document, where they may
have been more (or less) visible. It is a hybrid of interfaces
“B” and “D.”

3.1. Research Hypotheses
This study has been informed by uncertainty and foraging
decisions in information seeking, since patches of information
can be found in diﬀerent elements of search interfaces in
potentially uncertain search environments. The hypothesis that
unexpected forms of uncertainty may trigger more exploratory
behavior can be approached from user perceptions of task
diﬃculty in information search (Cohen et al., 2007). Exploitation
of a patch vs. exploration of background options in foraging can
be observed by eye gaze and user search behaviors, and explained
by the concept of information scent (Chi et al., 2001; Pirolli et al.,
2001).
Based on the concepts of uncertainty and foraging decisions
and their relationship to information seeking, we propose four
research hypotheses in this study:

Interface “D” mimicked EBSCOhost2 and similar systems that
provide indexing terms alongside each document. As well
as the standard elements from interface “A,” interface “D”
displayed the MeSH terms associated with each document,
as part of that document’s surrogate (Figure 1C).
Again, terms were introduced with “Try:” and were
clickable.
Each interface was labeled with a simple ﬁgure: a square,
circle, diamond, or triangle, which was referred to in the exit
questionnaire. A save icon alongside each retrieved document
was provided to collect user perceived relevant documents.

H1: Users will attend to diﬀerent elements of search
interfaces when they are under perceived diﬃcult search
environments.
H2: User traits of cognitive styles will aﬀect information seeking
strategies in terms of eye gaze behavior.
H3: Search behavior associated with expanding mental eﬀorts
will change in uncertain environments.
H4: Search behavior types that involve notable mental eﬀorts
and exploitation of resources are correlated with changes in
eye gaze patterns.

3.3. Search Topics
The search topics used were a subset of the clinical topics
from OHSUMED (Hersh et al., 1994), originally created for
information retrieval system evaluation. They were slightly
rewritten to read as instructions to the participants (see Figure 2
for an example). Topics were selected to cover a range of
diﬃculties.

3.4. Procedure

3.2. Search Interfaces

Participants were given brief instructions about the search
task and system features, followed by a practice topic and
then the searches proper. They were informed that the test
collection is incomplete and out-of-date since the OHSUMED
test collection (Hersh et al., 1994) was used, with MEDLINE data
from 1987 to 1991. Recorded user interaction data included all
queries, mouse clicks, retrieved and saved documents, time spent,
and eye movements. Electroencephalogram (EEG) readings were
also captured.
Background and exit questionnaires collected demographic
information and asked participants about their perception of
the search process. Participants’ opinions of the tasks and the
interfaces were sought. Finally, information on their cognitive

Participants searched on four diﬀerent search interfaces, with a
single search system behind the scenes. The four search interfaces
were distinguished by whether MeSH terms were presented and
how the displayed MeSH terms were generated, partly because we
were concerned with how users search for patches of information,
using diﬀerent information seeking strategies such as exploitation
of a patch vs. exploration of background options. The complexity
of interface design characterized diﬀerent perceptions of risk of
information patches.
Interface “A” mimicked web search and other search systems
with no controlled vocabulary. This interface had a brief
task description at top; a conventional search box and
button; and each result was represented with its title,
authors, publication details, and abstract where available.

The search system was built on

speciﬁcally weighted.
Eye gaze data was recorded from two Sony VFCB-EX480B
infrared (IR) cameras which were controlled by Seeing Machines
FaceLab 4.5 software4 and attached to a dedicated machine
running Windows 7. At the same time, EyeWorks Design and
EyeWorks Record5 were used to present instructions for the
corresponding search tasks during the experiment. Gaze points
were recorded at 60 Hz, and the eye gaze data included the x
and y coordinates of where the eye was looking on the screen,
as well as the time of that recording. EEG data were recorded
with an Emotiv headset6 to monitor brain activities throughout
the search session. A Windows 7 computer was dedicated to the
cognitive styles test.

Areas of interest

applied in the study of the relationship between user traits and
search performance (Saracevic et al., 1988).
In the study a post-search questionnaire was used to assess
user perceptions about the search processes, in which search
task diﬃculty was also identiﬁed as important moderator of eye
gaze behavior (Toker et al., 2013). No follow-up interview was
conducted in this study. As such, our data analysis was focused on
information search in a diﬃcult environment with a high degree
of perceived uncertainty.

3.6. Data Analysis
Recordings were analyzed to see how often there were ﬁxations
in diﬀerent parts of document surrogates (i.e., diﬀerent elements
of the interfaces), and therefore how often people looked at each
part.
Four common areas of interest (AOI) were speciﬁed:
title, author, abstract and MeSH (except for Interface A,
without MeSH) to investigate which elements received attention.
EyeWorks Analyze7 was used to specify the AOI, and ﬁxations
were speciﬁed as gazes within a 5-pixel radius which lasted at least
75 ms (Marshall, 2000). The EEG data was not included since our
analysis was focused on eye gaze and search behaviors.
Since we were interested in the relationship between user
perceptions of search tasks vs. system features, and eye gaze
behavior, the data were analyzed by a logarithmic cross-ratio
analysis (Fleiss et al., 2003) for dichotomous outcomes. The
independent variables of user traits of cognitive styles and
perceived search task diﬃculty, as well as dependent variables
of search behavior and eye gaze measures, were converted into
binary variables for further analysis. This data analysis technique
was chosen because it is resistant to sample selection bias and

4. RESULTS OF SEARCH BEHAVIOR AND
EYE GAZE
Overall, our results support H1, H2, and H4, indicating
signiﬁcant signiﬁcant eﬀects on eye gaze behavior in terms of
proportion of ﬁxations in reading time. This in turn translates
to diﬀerent strategies in dealing with risk and ambiguity.

4.1. Search task difﬁculty and eye gaze
Table 1 reveals that there was a statistically signiﬁcant
relationship between user perception of search task diﬃculty
and proportion of ﬁxations in reading time on all elements in
interfaces. One-way ANOVA indicates a signiﬁcant interaction
eﬀect of interface and task diﬃculty on the ﬁxations time
spent in title [F(3, 248) = 3.72, p < 0.05] and MeSH terms
[F(3, 248) = 3.71, p < 0.05], but it is not the case for the
element of author [F(3, 248) = 1.69, p > 0.05] and abstract
[F(3, 248) = 1.55, p > 0.05]. These results support our ﬁrst
research hypothesis that users will attend to diﬀerent elements of
search interfaces, when they are under perceived diﬃcult search
environments.

less attention to the abstract in interfaces. This might reﬂect the
fact that using MeSH terms can be more eﬃcient in the search
processes.
Number of mouse clicks. Table 5 indicates a statistically
signiﬁcant relationship between the number of mouse clicks and
the element of title visited. That is, users who clicked the mouse
more often were less likely to be interested in the titles.
Number of pages viewed. Table 6 brings evidence for the same
inverse relationship between the number of pages viewed vs. titles
inspected.
Number of documents saved. Table 7 reveals that there was
a statistically signiﬁcant relationship as regards the number of
documents saved vs. abstracts and MeSH terms as document
segments inspected: when users saved more documents, they
devoted signiﬁcantly more attention to the element of abstract,
but less attention to the MeSH terms.

In the study the E-CSA-WA (Extended Cognitive Style Analysis–
Wholistic Analytic) test was used to determine user’s cognitive
style. A Wholistic Analytic ratio (WA ratio) for each participant
was produced (Peterson et al., 2003). The results suggest that
there was no signiﬁcant relationship between the users’ cognitive
style and eye gaze across all elements in interfaces in terms of
proportion of ﬁxations in reading time.
One-way ANOVA of the eﬀects of search task diﬃculty, search
interface and cognitive style and their interactions on eye gaze
indicates signiﬁcant interaction eﬀects of diﬃculty and cognitive
style [F(1, 240) = 4.54, p < 0.05], and cognitive style vs. search
interface [F(3, 240) = 2.89, p < 0.05] in terms of ﬁxation time on
the element of abstract. We found signiﬁcant interaction eﬀects
between search task diﬃculty and search interface [F(3, 240) =
4.19, p < 0.01], and search interface and cognitive style
[F(1, 240) = 4.24, p < 0.01] for the element of MeSH terms. These
results suggest that searchers with diﬀerent cognitive styles may use
diﬀerent search strategies under an environment with uncertainty
perceived as diﬃcult and observed by their eye gaze behavior. Our
second research hypothesis that user traits of cognitive styles
will aﬀect information seeking strategies in eye gaze behavior is
supported.

4.3. Search Task Difﬁculty and Search
Behavior
Table 2 shows that when search tasks were perceived diﬃcult,
users tended to spend less time searching, issued less queries
or typed queries, saved fewer documents and had fewer mouse
clicks, but there was no diﬀerence in the number of MeSH queries
issued and the number of pages viewed.
Overall, the results indicate that searchers made less mental
eﬀort when the search tasks were diﬃcult, and they tended to
optimize limited resources in information seeking, demonstrated
both by eye gaze (Table 1) and search behavior (Table 2). Search
behavior associated with expending mental eﬀorts like issuing
MeSH terms and viewing SERPs has not changed according to the
uncertainty within the environment, such as perceived search task
diﬃculty. Therefore, our third research hypothesis that search
behavior associated with expanding mental eﬀorts will change in

Number of queries issued. Table 3 shows that there was a
statistically signiﬁcant relationship between the number of
queries issued and the area of interest (AOI) of MeSH terms.
In other words, when users issued more queries, they paid
signiﬁcantly more attention to the MeSH terms in search results.
This might indicate that processes of query reformulations are
very resource intensive, particularly for using MeSH terms.

Risk and Ambiguity in Information Seeking

Summary of search behavior and gaze pattern types. Table 8
provides a summary of search behaviors and gaze patterns. These
results clearly show that types of searching behavior, such as
issuing queries with MeSH terms that imply notable mental eﬀort
and strive at the exploitation of resources, are correlated with
changes in eye gaze patterns. Therefore, our fourth research
hypothesis that search behavior that involve with notable mental
eﬀorts and exploitation of resources are correlated with changes
in eye gaze patterns is supported.

In the above eye tracking study, the document surrogates
and the four layouts characterize diﬀerent perceptions of risk of
information patches, gazing time being a good ﬁgure of merit
for exploitation. Exploration is the jumping gaze combined with
a repeated query as these reduce overall ambiguity. There is
evidence that wholistic users prefer to get an overview of tasks
before drilling down to detail, whereas analytic users look for
speciﬁc information. These two extreme user behaviors rely
on the two measurement operators, namely risk- vs. ambiguity
reduction, in diﬀerent order, proving non-commutativity. At
this point there is no signiﬁcant relationship between the users’
cognitive style and the AOIs though.
However, if we also change the perceived risk by varying
the search interface, the picture changes. The eﬀect of cognitive
styles, interfaces and their interactions on the AOI of MeSH
terms (excluding Interface A) is statistically signiﬁcant in terms of
cognitive style and interface interactions, and weakly signiﬁcant
in terms of cognitive style [F(1, 188) = 2.79, p < 0.01]. Interfaces
make a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence for the wholistic style
[F(2, 111) = 6.58, p < 0.001], and cognitive styles make a
statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in Interface B [F(1, 62) = 5.11,
p < 0.05]. The results indicate that wholistic users’ attention
to the MeSH terms is more aﬀected by search interfaces than
that of analytic users, and this interaction eﬀect is signiﬁcant
when interacting with Interface B. Thus, non-commutative
measurements emerge.
To sum up, uncertainty as a composite of risk and ambiguity
drives information seeking behavior in a complex way, with
successive decisions attempting to minimize both components
at the same time. However, to ﬁnd their joint optimum is
not possible, because risk-prone and ambiguity-prone behavior
manifest two versions of foraging attitude, called the “consume
ﬁrst and worry later” (exploitation) vs. the “worry ﬁrst and
consume later” (exploration) types. Whichever option taken,

The relationship is not statistically signiﬁcant (—), positively signiﬁcant (●), or negatively
signiﬁcant (❍).

These ﬁndings indicate distinct strategies in dealing with
uncertainty, possibly changing from preferring exploration to
exploitation and vice versa, and therefore corroborate our
hypothesis that the corresponding observations do not commute,
which hints at a form of quantum-like behavior.

it becomes the context of the opposite alternative, so that
ambiguity minimization dependent on risk minimization vs.
risk minimization dependent on ambiguity minimization yield
diﬀerent sets of retrieved items, i.e., the outcome of information
seeking as a process is non-commutative.
For every case where this joint optimum seeking mentality
inﬂuences the results, plus the decision making process that
has led to a particular outcome must be preserved for future
reconstruction, our ﬁndings are relevant. We have found that
the above two types of behavior go back to the application of
two operators, risk- and ambiguity-aversion, so that by applying
now this, then the other ﬁrst, their sequential application leads
to diﬀerent results, called non-commutativity. This is related to
the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics, therefore we
identify information seeking as another link to quantum decision
theory (Wittek et al., 2013; Ashtiani and Azgomi, 2014; Aerts and
Sozzo, 2016).

cognitive types in a diﬀerent setting. In a broader context,
noncommuting measurements are standard tools in quantum
mechanics, and they are being explored in quantum decision
theory for modeling decision problems and known fallacies—
our work connects information seeking to this line of
research.

6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE
RESEARCH
We interpreted risk and ambiguity as two types of measurement
on an uncertain environment, arguing that in an information
foraging scenario, these measurements are sequential and do not
commute, that is, reversing their order yields diﬀerent outcomes.
We demonstrated this by analyzing user behavior in interacting
with diﬀerent designs of search results, speciﬁcally, by tracking
the gaze of users. Depending on the degree of uncertainty
involved, qualitatively diﬀerent types of information seeking
behavior emerged, agreeing with our hypotheses.
We have reason to believe that similar data, such as
clickstreams, will show similar patternedness as evidence
of non-commutative user behavior manifesting the same
