Introduction

Technological advances in several knowledge areas enable the
development of hardware and software solutions that aims to
simplify people with specific needs’ lives. Among the users’
profiles that can benefit from this scenario, the one formed
by people with physical disabilities compose a universe directly favored by these advances. According to the report
by the World Health Organization, more than a billion people have some kind of disability worldwide (WHO, 2017).
This number reveals the existence of a considerable part of
the population who have difficulties in performing simple
daily tasks properly, such as eating, communicating, cleaning,
working or even moving.
Specifically in Brazil, according to the 2010 census by the
Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, 23.9% of the
Brazilian population declared having at least one type of disability. Of these, 7% reported some type of motor impairment,
ranging from mild restrictions such as tremors or lack of mobility of a limb, to more severe problems such as amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis or tetraplegia, for example (IBGE, 2010). Assistive Technology (AT) is the research area concerned with
the development of devices and applications that seek to improve the quality of life of people with physical or cognitive
limitations (DRNP, 2012).
The AT term itself is relatively new, and its definition is
still maturing. However, the use of AT resources is not recent,
since it refers back to the beginnings of human history. At
that time, the adoption of mechanisms to assist people’s daily
lives could be observed in the use of primitive artifacts, such
as tree branches, used as walking sticks, for example. On
the other hand, the emerging preoccupation with assistive
issues must be credited to the more contemporary thoughts
that focus on the inclusion of all individuals in a society where
each individual should have the right to participate actively

in it.
Formally, the term originates in 1988, defined in the United
States of America as a legal element within that country’s Public Law 100-407, which makes up the American Disabilities
Act (ADA). These laws regulate the rights of disabled citizens
in the United States, providing a legal basis for public funds
to purchase the resources they need. At the European level,
AT is often replaced (or used as a synonym) for ”Technical
Aids”or ”Assistive Technologies”. Galvão Filho (2009) specifically highlights the EUSTAT (Empowering Users Through
Assistive Technology) project, in which the term ”Support
Technologies”has the following definition:
”The term Support Technologies encompasses all products and services capable of compensating for functional limitations, facilitating independence and enhancing
the quality of life of people with disabilities and the elderly”.
In Brazil, the concept of AT is even more recent. In the
Brazilian context, Bersch (2017) states that AT is a research
area that aims to provide greater independence, quality of
life and social inclusion for the physically disabled, increasing the possibilities of communication, mobility, interaction
with the environment, learning and integration with family,
friends, and society. Thus, analyzing AT definitions around
the world, it is possible to perceive that they all converge
to one essential goal: improving the people’s life quality by
investing in processes, devices, or services that enhance these
users’ preserved skills.
Researches related to AT have been producing solutions
that aim to help or simplify people’s lives. Prosthetics, wheelchairs, optical glasses, television legends, hygiene aids,
assistant robots, computer access tools, among others, are
examples of products with an assistive nature. According to

Solutions focused on High-Level Assistive Technology: Perceptions and Trends observed from a Systematic Literature Mapping

SEABRA and MENDES (2009), several classifications that
can be used to categorize AT types. One of them considers the
cost and the resources used, dividing them into three levels:
• Low-level AT - simple, non-electric and low-cost devices;
• Medium-level AT - devices that use electricity, but
without computational resources; and
• High-level AT - applications, services, or devices that
use specific software and/or hardware to achieve their
goals.
The use of high-level AT, specifically, brings together several fields of study, depending on the designed application.
Areas such as Universal Accessibility (UA), Decision Support Systems (DSS), Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) and
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) potentialize a new generation of AT to improve the lives of people with physical
limitations (Alonso, 2015).
An example of this type of solution is the IOM (an acronym
for Interface Óculos Mouse, in Portuguese), a project that
develops a wearable device with sensors, which implement
an interface to computer access, using data captured from
head movements (Machado, 2010; Rodrigues et al., 2016;
Machado et al., 2019). Figure 1 highlights the IOM operating
scheme.

Figura 1. IOM basic operating scheme. Source: Cardoso et al. (2018).

However, to consolidate and effectively adopt a high-level
AT, such as IOM, specific applications and development
frameworks must accompany it. In this scenario, this paper’s
primary goal is to identify the main high-level AT-based
solutions, aimed at people with motor limitations, developed
by the scientific community. Besides mapping this research
area, this work also investigates trends concerning the main
development methods, technologies, and practices used to
design software applications of this nature.
To achieve these goals, a bibliographical review was executed on this topic. Thus, this paper presents the Systematic
Literature Mapping (SLM) about this theme, highlighting all
process stages. The SLM focuses specifically on applications
for people with motor limitations, but with have preserved
head movements. Based on the observations and analysis of
the scientific paper set retrieved by the SLM, a taxonomy
for classifying the high-level AT solutions found during the
mapping is proposed. Finally, the paper answers three SLM
research questions besides highlighting a series of technological and architectural characteristics perceived in the studied
works.
Thus, this paper’s main goal is to map this research area
to identify relevant characteristics in the AT development
process, in academia. The SLM outcomes will serve as a
foundation for understanding the state-of-the-art of this research area. Besides that, the survey’s results will guide the
development of an AT-based specific framework for the IOM
device, as a case study.

Cardoso et al. 2020

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 details the
SLM’s organization and execution. Section 3 presents the proposed taxonomy. Section 4 highlights main characteristics,
aspects and technological trends, based on the works’ analysis. Section 5 discusses and answers the three SLM research
questions. Finally, Section 6 presents the paper conclusions
and indicates the project’s next steps.

Systematic Literature Mapping

To map the state-of-the-art in the work’s research area, the
SLM methodology was used. The SLM performs a series of
steps to generate the map of the area, that is, a set of works that
builds a broad prospection of the researched theme (Petersen
et al., 2008). The following subsections detail the SLM protocol used in this work. The complete flow of SLM execution
is shown in Figure 2.

2.1

Initial exploratory search

To complete the protocol properly, it is necessary to perform
an earlier step, the search for a reference article. This phase’s
aim is to find, through simple exploratory research, a work
related to the research topic to be investigated.
The idea is to use this study as a calibrator during the SLM
protocol completion. As this step result, the following papers
were entirely examined: Ossmann et al. (2014); Salnikov et al.
(2014); Miesenberger et al. (2014); Neto et al. (2012).
The comparative analysis between these works resulted in
the choice of Ossmann et al. (2014) as a reference article for
this SLM. This paper introduces AsTeRICS (Assistive Technology Rapid Integration & Construction Set), a development
platform that enables the creation of adaptable AT solutions
through reusable software components. Thus, it was considered more complete when compared to the other papers, since
it allows the AT applications design in different contexts of
use, through the reuse of software structures.

2.2

Filling the SLM protocol

The SLM protocol initially requests the definition of several
elements about the research to be performed. The first one is
the main goal of the bibliographic review. For this mapping,
such aim was defined as:
”Identify and characterize the state-of-the-art on ATbased solutions for people with motor limitations.”
By reaching this objective, it is expected to ground the work
conceptually, allowing a broad view of this area of research.
In addition to providing this conceptual basis, surveying these
perceptions and trends will further assist in the design of highlevel AT solutions focused on the IOM interaction device.
Due to the diversity of limitations that can affect individuals physically or cognitively, it was necessary to restrict
the focus of this work. Thus, the specific application domain
covered by this paper concerns AT solutions for users with
preserved head movements. This choice was driven by two
main motivations. First, the fact the head is the last part of
the body that loses its mobility (Mulfari et al., 2015a). Also,

Solutions focused on High-Level Assistive Technology: Perceptions and Trends observed from a Systematic Literature Mapping

losing functional capacity, specifically in terms of mobility,
is a natural factor throughout people’s lives (da Cruz and
Emmel, 2012; Nunes et al., 2010). The second aspect, as previously highlighted, is related to the IOM project, which aims
to develop an alternative interaction device, aimed at people
with motor limitations in the upper limbs.
Following the protocol, it is recommended that at least
three researchers be involved in SLM to ensure the quality
of the results. In this context, the mapping, which lasted six
months, covered three research axes:
1. AT-based Application Developments;
2. AT-based interfaces; and
3. Evaluation Methodologies for AT Solutions.
SLM’s main objective encompasses these three research
axes. However, each axis focuses on different aspects described in the works retrieved by SLM. This paper specifically
highlights the first subject, for which three research questions
were elaborated:
1. How does scientific research present the development
and evaluation of AT software that allows people with
physical limitations to use computational applications?
2. Are there software development frameworks specifically
focused on AT? and
3. What does characterizes a solution for software development as AT-oriented?
Considering the SLM main goal, the three research questions, and using the reference article as a calibrator, the protocol
was completed. Firstly, the following search engines have
been chosen to retrieve the SLM’s studies:
•
•
•
•

IEEE Xplore Digital Library;
ACM Digital Library;
Springer; and
Science Direct.

Then, the following generic search string was elaborated
to retrieve the initial articles set:
((”human computer interaction”OR HCI) AND (”assistive technology”OR accessibility) AND (motor OR physical OR impairment OR disability) AND (framework
OR platform OR API OR evaluation OR test OR guidelines OR protocols))

This string was adapted to the specific syntax of each of the
search engines used. The period covered by the mapping was
between 2012 and 2017. It is noteworthy that date information
is not part of the search string, as this filter is set separately
in these search engines.
To complete the protocol, exclusion, and inclusion criteria were defined to be applied in the SLM filter stages. The
following criteria were used for exclusion:
• Study published exclusively in medical area events or
journals;
• Study published before 20121 ;
• Abstracts, posters or articles with two or fewer pages;
• Duplicate works (retrieved by more than one search engine);
• Work-related only to non-motor deficiencies;
• Complete books; and
• Study related to seniors without motor limitations.
On the other hand, to add works to the partial set of studies,
the following inclusion criteria were used.
• Study related to AT for computer accessibility; and
• Study published before 2012, but considered relevant.
The idea of applying these filters is to ensure results that
are within a specific period, which deal with the development
of assistive solutions aimed at people with motor limitations.

2.3

Running the SLM

The steps predicted in the process were executed, following
the flow highlighted in Figure 2. In this way, the search execution step was performed, and, as a result, 2,257 bibliographic
references were retrieved and stored. This article collection
was then submitted to the first filter where a group of seven
researchers analyzed the work’s title, keywords, and abstracts,
applying the exclusion and inclusion criteria previously established.
Applying the first filter resulted in a subset of 173 articles.
These studies were submitted to the SLM’s second filter. In
this step, three expertise researchers analyzed title, abstract,
keywords, introduction, and conclusions of the 173 articles.
This step intended to characterize these studies in the three
SLM’s research axes. The three researchers’ analyses were

crosschecked in discussions mediated by the group supervisor,
resulting in the Venn diagram shown in Figure 3.

Figura 3. Articles grouped by research axis, after the second filter.

Specifically, concerning this article, we selected 35 works,
identified as Framework in Figure 3. These papers were sent
to the last filter, which consisted of fully reading and analyzing each of the 35 selected articles. This last filter resulted in
27 works that can be defined as the search area map. The next
section explores these works, beyond presenting a taxonomy
that classifies them according to their functionality and type.

SLM’s Taxonomy

The SLM articles’ analysis resulted in the proposition of two
works’ classifications: Type of Solution and Applications’
Functionalities.

3.1

Types of Developed Solutions

This classification groups the works according to the proposed software artifact. From this perspective, the studies
were qualified as:

specifically designed for game development. Both have whitebox framework characteristics since to develop applications
through them, it is necessary to have reasonable knowledge
about the operation and structure of their source code.
All other works retrieved by the SLM have developed
specific prototypes, used for particular users or contexts. They
were designed to solve individual problems, i.e. they are not
intended to be reusable software frameworks applicable to
different contexts or usage scenarios.

3.2

Applications’ Functionalities

This classification divides studies according to their primary
goals. From this perspective, the works were grouped in:
• Computer Access (CA): simplifies or allows access to
the computer;
• Environment Control (EC): allows the management of
the space where the user is inserted;
• Assistive Games (AG): provide games tailored to the
special needs of specific user groups; and
• Mixed Solutions (MS): applications that can be used for
more than one of the above purposes.
Figure 5 highlights the distribution of the works retrieved,
according to this classification.

• Software frameworks: general and reusable proposals
used to simplify application development; and
• Specific prototypes: solutions for special purposes. Used
for validations or as case studies to solve individual
problems.
In the universe of analyzed studies, four papers were categorized as Software Frameworks. Among these, AsTeRICS
consists of a framework that uses concepts of prototyping
through visual modeling, making feasible the development
of AT solutions without the need for knowledge of advanced development techniques or even programming languages (Ossmann et al., 2014; Veigl et al., 2013). Considering
the evolutionary process of building software frameworks
proposed by Roberts et al. (1996), AsTeRICS is a visual programming tool, since it allows the generation of applications
through visual components connection. Figure 4 shows the
configuration suite used to develop the AT-based solutions
with AsTeRICS.
In turn, the ATLab (Miesenberger et al., 2014) and the
GNomon (Aced Lopez et al., 2015) frameworks are solutions

Figura 5. Works grouped by functionalities.

As can be seen, according to the SLM’s results, most of the
works (ten papers) seek to enable or simplify CA, adapting
devices and applications to overcome the problems caused
by a specific disability, when using computers. Three studies
describe solutions designed to work exclusively with EC. In
turn, five of them are assistive games (18 in total). The nine

solutions are MS, where two apply to the three categories, one
for AG and CA and the other five provide CA in conjunction
with EC, totaling 27 studies retrieved by SLM. Table 1 groups
the studies considering this classification.

Among the works focused on CA, the FHCI (Facial HumanComputer Interface) is a solution that helps people to use
computers without using hands (Antunes et al., 2016). It is
based on a control scheme that combines the current cursor
position on the computer with the user’s visual intent. The
FHCI interface also records various usage data, besides supporting the adaptation of other sensors to simulate the buttons.
FHCI contextual architecture is presented in Figure 6.

Cardoso et al. 2020

The ETM (Eye Tracking Mouse) is another work in this
category (Lupu et al., 2013). It consists of a prototype that
uses video glasses, webcam, and specific software running
an eye-tracking algorithm. ETM allows the user to navigate
its particular GUI (Graphical User Interface) just by moving
their eyes. Following this research line, Rantanen et al. (2011)
propose a solution that combines video-based eye tracking
with eyebrow motion detection.
In turn, Martins et al. (2015) propose a multi-modal interface that uses MS Kinect to control the computer through
head, eyebrows, or mouth movements, and voice commands.
Finally, Galante and Menezes (2012) develop an application
that uses eye-tracking for people with cerebral palsy. Its goal
is that users can communicate by choosing symbols on a
virtual card.
A conceptual model architecture for a universal AT is presented in Karpov and Ronzhin (2014). Its goal is to allow users
with different disabilities to use the proposal through several
interaction ways. Cruz et al. (2015) propose two software
extensions using Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) through
the Emotiv EPOC device. DOSBOX Gyro consists of an extension to navigate the DOSVOX GUI menus through head
movements. The second extension is microFenix, an application that simulates mouse and keyboard actions to computer
control from user-generated sounds or breaths captured by
specific sensors.
Mulfari et al. (2015b) present an application that uses cloud
computing to access AT-based software. The paper discusses
the impact of using SaaS (Software as a Service) with webaccessible AT applications. In turn, Mulfari et al. (2015a)
explore IoT (Internet of Things) concepts to use low-cost
embedded systems to support interaction between users with
disabilities and computers. The goal is to create AT-oriented
solutions on embedded devices. As a study case, the paper
details a prototype development, consisting of glasses adapted
for people to control the computer without using their hands.
McCullagh et al. (2013) propose a multi-modal system to
control virtual environments. The solution, called hBCI (Hybrid BCI), combines sending EEG signals with eye-tracking
interaction.
In terms of EC, Paul et al. (2013) present an environment
control interface that can be controlled from different interaction methods, such as tongue movements. The application
automatically discovers home appliances that understand wireless protocols (Zigbee and Bluetooth) in the environment,
presenting services supported by these devices in its own GUI.
Figure 7 presents the solution architecture.

Figura 6. FHCI contextual architecture. Source: Antunes et al. (2016).

STTK (Speech-To-Text plus Kinect), is a multi-modal Natural User Interface (NUI) (Salnikov et al., 2014). It aims to
improve computer access experience for users with motor
disabilities in the upper limbs. The solution combines two
types of data input: gestures and voice using STT (SpeechTo-Text), TTS (Text-To-Speech) technologies, and gesture
recognition.

Figura 7. Device control architecture. Source: Paul et al. (2013).

SINASense is technological support to provide its users

Solutions focused on High-Level Assistive Technology: Perceptions and Trends observed from a Systematic Literature Mapping

with greater autonomy when interacting with their environment (Manresa Yee et al., 2013). It provides sensory stimulation based on the user’s movements, detecting and tracking
movements through a webcam and a tape placed on the user’s
hand. Tripathy and Raheja (2014) describe the development
of an application to control a robot (FireBird V) as an assistant
for people with disabilities. The robot receives commands
from EEG signals, triggered by the EPOC device via a specific
GUI.
Concerning works categorized as AG, for example, there
are solutions like the Doce Labirinto (Sweet Labyrinth, in
Portuguese). It consists of a game that challenges the player
to move the Sphero robot to the maze’s end, using head movements (captured via IOM device) to do it (Cardoso et al.,
2016). Figure 8 presents Doce Labirinto’s usage context.

environment to encourage rehabilitation exercise. This paper
falls into the CA and AG categories.
The other works related to the AC and EC categories. In
this context Caruso et al. (2013) introduce My-World-in-MyTablet (MWiMT), a modular user-centric platform that supports two types of data inputs: hardware-based and bio-signal
based. MWiMT uses a tablet to run its core components: AuxiliHome - Used for home control through accessible from a
specific GUI; and FlexyGlass/Adapters- software module that
makes the input type transparent to the controlled application.
Figure 9 highlights the MWiMT’s architecture.

Figura 9. MWiMT’s architecture. Source: Caruso et al. (2013).

Figura 8. Doce Labirinto’s usage scenario. Source: Cardoso et al. (2016).

In turn, Ossmann et al. (2012) present an application developed with the AsTeRICS framework to adapt PlayStation
3 (PS3) games to people with disabilities. To this end, the
paper describes a model that allows controlling PS3 games
via the OSKA (On-Screen Keyboard Application) keyboard.
As a case study, the article explores two PS3 adapted games
to use the developed control.
Scardovelli and Frère (2015) highlight an AT-oriented
solution composed of a webcam and a 3D computer game.
The game, called “Beto in the Forest”, is monitored by a
supervisor system running in the background. This system
maps user actions via webcam so that, when movements are
captured, commands are triggered in the game.
In this category, it is also worth mentioning the two works
previously described in Section 3.1 as development frameworks. The articles describing GNomom (Aced Lopez
et al., 2015) and ATLab (Miesenberger et al., 2014) solutions highlight games’ development to validate their respective
reusable software structures. Finally, in relation to mixed
solutions, articles using the AsTeRICS framework are case
studies that cover prototyping in the three categories defined
by the taxonomy (Veigl et al., 2013; Ossmann et al., 2014).
Lin et al. (2017) feature AID (Adaptive Interface Design)
a multi-modal interface for people with arthritis. It uses a
special glove designed to measure finger movements and grip
strength. In addition, the eye-tracking technique is also used
for alternative virtual environment interface. It provides an

In turn, Mulfari et al. (2014) propose a tool that acts as
an adapter between particular assistive equipment used by
users and computers. Huo et al. (2013) present the dTDS
(dual-mode Tongue Drive System) to expand the TDS (an
interface that works through tongue movements) by adding
the use of voice commands to it.
Aly et al. (2015)’s paper introduces SMARTUNIVERS,
an interface for people with different physical disabilities,
designed to integrate them into the work environment. Levy
et al. (2013) describe ActiveIris, an accessibility toolkit that
uses a webcam to track the eyes of its users. Through its
interface, ActiveIris provides computer access, facilitating
access to social networks, smartphones, and Internet browsing,
as well as providing options for environment control.
It was possible to realize that, despite the classification by
proposed functionalities, all the works deal with an intermediate interface that mediates the interaction between user and
application. This interface usually has two main purposes:
• Perform or assist the basic functions of the solution itself;
and
• Configure the proposed AT-based application.
Thus, it is feasible to state that all proposals, at some point,
interact with the computer, even if through a third user who
sets up the application. Finally, Table 2 highlights both the
devices and the main forms of interaction used in AT solutions characterized as prototypes according to the proposed
taxonomy.

Structural aspects and technological trends

Besides classifying the solutions in the SLM, the complete
analysis of the recovered works allowed extracting relevant
data about them. This made it possible to draw a panorama of
the researched area, identifying some tendencies, techniques,

Diagrams and models

In terms of modeling and design, the works use different strategies to represent their overall architecture. In this sense, two
types of diagrams appear frequently: Context Diagrams and
Layer Component Diagrams. The use of the first diagram
makes sense once many of the works use design and development strategies based on UCD (User-Centered Design)
concepts. In this way, providing a perspective of using the application, from the user point-of-view, allow contextualizing
all the elements and actors involved in the interaction.
On the other hand, the works that represent their structures
employing schemes of components in layers, use levels of
abstraction that vary according to the specificity that they
want to detail. Thus, this representation is widely used, simplifying aspects such as general functioning and communication between the components of developed AT applications.
The third possibility of representation is explored in Caruso
et al. (2013), where a group-by-container view is adopted.

4.2

Software architectures

Most of the works analyzed present architectural features
based on the Client-Server model, dividing the structures into
at least two layers of software. Exceptions are the projects
that adopt Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) concepts in
their design (Miesenberger et al., 2014; Caruso et al., 2013;
Mulfari et al., 2015b; Paul et al., 2013).
Although some projects address their basic needs with
Client-Server adoption, they can naturally evolve into servicebased adoption. The maturation of some prototypes in market
solutions may lead to the need for better structuring, to scale
the solutions.

Perceptions about solution-user interactions

A trend towards the adoption of multi-modal solutions is
easily observable since 56% of the analyzed works use at least
two types of data entry in the applications. The motivations
for using multi-modal interfaces found are:
• Enhancement: The second data input is used to refine
the main data entry to improve the interaction quality;
and
• Reducing fatigue: Alternative input aim at reducing fatigue caused by excessive movements required from the
primordial interaction form of the solution.
In these cases, a clear feature in multi-modal solutions is
using voice commands as the second form of interaction in
applications.
Solutions that do not focus on the interaction itself, but that
act as facilitators to use AT have also been found (Paul et al.,
2013; Mulfari et al., 2014, 2015a). The idea behind these
projects is to provide the infrastructure that allows a specific
AT to be used by its users outside a previously configured

Solutions focused on High-Level Assistive Technology: Perceptions and Trends observed from a Systematic Literature Mapping

environment. In this sense, strategies for accessing an AT
configuration from cloud services, for example, simplify the
AT configuration process in a new environment.
Finally, considering the data output and feedback to users,
applications usually adopt GUI as the main interaction way.
Also, some projects use alternative data output, such as interactions through tangible interfaces, using robots, for example (Ossmann et al., 2014; Veigl et al., 2013; Cardoso et al.,
2016).

4.4

Technological trends

The technologies employed in the projects usually depend on
the work team expertise or are linked to applications’ characteristics. To reduce costs, most solutions use free tools
and/or develop adapted devices. However, some works use
proprietary libraries or frameworks, a practice that increases
the final cost of the application, and limits the possibilities
of innovation, since it is not always possible to customize or
extend these tools.
Some trends have also been noted in using libraries and
devices, such as the use of OpenCV for image capture and
processing, and the adoption of EPOC for the BCI solutions
development.

of the developed solution. There are, however, solutions that
suggest the adoption of more formal methods of development,
for example, in Ossmann et al. (2014); Veigl et al. (2013);
Ossmann et al. (2012).
Still in this context, the article describing Doce Labirinto, for example, uses concepts of agile software development, in addition to project management strategies based on
SCRUM (Cardoso et al., 2016). Thus, the use of methods,
similar to those practiced in industry, would be a coherent
strategy, since the applications’ design of an assistive nature shares similar characteristics with conventional software
development.
Specifically addressing the evaluations of the developed
solutions, the works usually perform functional tests in them.
In this sense, several works carry out usability tests on the
solutions, using several specific tools for this purpose (Huo
et al., 2013; Levy et al., 2013; Antunes et al., 2016; Martins
et al., 2015). Others also evaluate the user experience (UX)
aspects in using the proposed solution (Manresa Yee et al.,
2013; Cardoso et al., 2016). Finally, the use of structural
tests, to guarantee the level of quality or coverage of the
modules, classes, or even parts of the developed software is
not mentioned.

4.5

Development Processes

The papers do not mention the techniques used throughout the
application development process. The use of methods, similar
to those practiced in the industry, would be likely since the
design of assistive applications shares characteristics with
conventional software development.
About tests, most of the studies perform functional evaluations on the solutions, using techniques and questionnaires that
generate both quantitative and qualitative data regarding the
use of the applications. No paper reports the use of software
quality assurance tools, a practice that could be interesting,
especially to ongoing works. Finally, another important issue
is the difficulty in testing the proposals with the final target
audience. Most of the developed prototypes are tested by
users with no physical disability, which influences the results
achieved.

Discussion

The execution of the SLM allowed covering a large and relevant set of works that explore the researched topic addressed
in this paper. This analysis attempted to answer three SLM
research questions highlighted below.

5.1

Research Question 1

”How does scientific research present the development and
evaluation of AT software that allows people with physical
limitations to use computational applications?”
It was not noticed the existence of specific standardization
in the process for the development of AT applications or devices. The papers do not describe nor mention the techniques
used in the development process, focusing on the presentation

Cardoso et al. 2020

Research Question 2

Are there software development frameworks specifically focused on AT?
Three solutions may be characterized as frameworks for
AT-based development. Among these, the AsTeRICS project
presents visions about both the use context of the proposed
solution and the architectural model of high-level layered
components. This framework is a visual editing tool, once it
allows the generation of applications from the components’
connection through a graphic tool (Ossmann et al., 2014;
Veigl et al., 2013; Ossmann et al., 2012).
The two other papers characterized as software frameworks
focus on specific fields of application, assistive games, in both
cases (Miesenberger et al., 2014; Aced Lopez et al., 2015).
On the other hand, the works that have resulted in prototypes, concentrate on the creation of solutions to meet certain
purposes or help to carry out some specific activity. They are
not characterized as development frameworks, as they are not
designed to provide software reuse in the design process of
other applications.

5.3

Research Question 3

What does characterizes a solution for software development
as AT-oriented?
No evidence was found regarding the application of development techniques or the adoption of architectural standards,
which would allow asserting that a device or application is
assistive. The proposals share the fact that they use, or adapt,
interaction devices to simplify (or make feasible) the use of
technologies to a specific group of users with physical disabilities. The provision of alternative interaction modes for
accessing computational resources is the closest approach to
the answer to this question.

Solutions focused on High-Level Assistive Technology: Perceptions and Trends observed from a Systematic Literature Mapping

Although there is a need for specific devices for AT, the
application of Universal Design principles in the mainstream
products’ development can eliminate the need for some of
them. However, to reach this level, it is necessary to consider
both similar and different characteristics in terms of design
and development of products aimed at anyone, regardless of
having or not any physical limitations.

Conclusion

Although broad and relevant, the result achieved with SLM
left some gaps to be filled. This can be partly explained by
the query string used on the search engines. To address the
three axes of research and, at the same time, to respect the
maximum number of characters accepted by the search engines, some keywords for this work were not used. SLM has
retrieved several works that use commercial devices such as
Microsoft Kinect, Leap Motion, or MYO, for example. The
articles usually describe adaptations made with these devices,
which allow their use by people with physical disabilities, in
very specific contexts. Thus, a look at the software development structures provided by these commercial devices is an
interesting point for the continuation of the work, seeking to
detect the basic characteristics of them, which are used by the
AT-oriented projects.
In the context of recognition of the field of research, SLM
was very important because it provided a broader view of
the area studied, allowing a better knowledge about trends,
technologies, and approaches that are being used for the development of high-level AT. The analysis of all these works
motivated the proposal of taxonomy to categorize the works
according to their functionalities or type of developed solution. This classification was used initially to group the works
found. However, with the progress of reading the SLM works,
it has become an interesting tool to organize and detect the
main uses, functionalities, and areas of development of highlevel applications of AT. The goal is that this classification
is extensible as new projects are developed enlarging this
research area taxonomy.
This bibliographic review also found a series of characteristics and tendencies used in the area. In this perspective,
developing solutions based on AT share similarities with conventional software design. Although there is still a need for
specific devices for AT, the growing application of Universal
Design principles in the mainstream products should gradually eliminate the need for them. However, this process takes
some time until it is possible to incorporate so many particularities into the products so anyone can use them. This
process tends to be long since there is no commercial interest
in developing assistive, low-cost solutions for a very specific
audience.
Analyzing the process involved during SLM, the result
helped to draw the general map of the research area, quantitatively, highlighting a significant number of works in progress
in this field. The next step in this work is the identification of
specific work focuses so that the results can be expanded.
Regarding the project in which this work is inserted, an
even more detailed review of the studies related to the software development frameworks will allow us to examine

Cardoso et al. 2020

the subject deeply. It is expected that the conjunction of
the SLM’s results with the analysis of the development frameworks of the interaction devices available in the market,
allows the initial identification and specification of the characteristics and functionalities desirable to guide a practical
case study.
It is expected to apply these perceptions and trends to design a specific software framework for the IOM device. This
can be achieved through the development of applications that
use it in different contexts. Thus, the scenarios highlighted
in the taxonomy proposed in this article will be explored to
raise features and functionalities that must compose such a
structure for the IOM interaction device, as an object study.
Lastly, the aim is to use this knowledge to propose a set of
design guidelines for AT-focused architecture, specifically
for users with motor disabilities.
