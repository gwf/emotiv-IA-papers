Abstract. Robots have been of great use to mankind for several years. In situation where human body fails
to operate as per the need robot’s functions in those situations quite efficiently. Electroencephalogram (EEG)
controlled hand assistant makes use of EEG signals and Brain Computer Interface (BCI). EEG signals are
obtained from the brain using Emotiv Insight headset, after which processing and features extraction of the
signals is performed and then conditioning of signals is done as it is a low amplitude signal with additive
noise. Signals processing is done on the analog signal by using wavelet transform. Wavelet transform will
help to extract information from the analog signal. Then the signals are assigned with the signatures to perform
the dedicated task Filtered signal is given to analog pins of Arduino Uno. With the help of inbuilt ADC
available on Arduino Uno, Digital Data is also made available on the digital pins. Then through MATLAB
access Arduino board. In near future if it gets similar kind of input it will understand exactly what operation
to perform. Further the Robotic hand assistant can be operated as we want.

1 Introduction
The human brain begins to show the electrical activity
during the embryonic period weeks. After birth, there are
1011 neurons (5*1014) synapses. The functioning and
movements of all body parts is controlled by brain. After
the registration of Aegean signal in all parts of the Cortex
in 1943, the extensive research area started from the first
year of 70th year. EEG is non-interfering and cheaper as
compared to other devices. As a result, EEG is considered
as most suitable one among all other. There are many
things which are highly automated in this world. People
who are paralyzed have to depend on others for the
fulfilment of a particular task. Also there are various tasks
which a scientist wants to handle but he is unable to,
because of the hazards of that particular substance or
chemical. Not only in such research areas, but also in
areas where the human being can ‘t be physically present
but needs to operate various important work in such areas,
EEG and BCI controlled prototypes can be used. In our
work, we have introduced a method in which servo motor
is controlled using an EEG signal collected from the
cerebral cortex area, which then artificially inserted as a
biological application. The proposed project uses AF3,
AF4, T7, T8, and Pz electrodes from EMOTIV INSIGHT
Headset [1]. To establish this purpose, the signals from
the PhysioBank ATM for EEG Motor Movements have
been taken. The signals are recorded by performing
various tasks out of which the selection of the first two
tasks which are 1) Baseline, eyes open. 2) Baseline, eyes
closed. These signals are recorded using BCI2000 system.

The data is provided in EDF+ format (European Data
Format) which have 64 channel output, each channel is
sampled at 160 samples per second [2]. The signals are
saved in .mat format for the ease of computation in
MATLAB. Standard Databases undergoes the feature
Extraction process which is done using Wavelet
Decomposition. During Decomposition, the selection of
Beta waves is done. EEG signals are often analysed in
terms of the frequency bands. In terms of voluntary motor
activity, 15-30 Hz range is reported which corresponds to
the Alpha and Beta range. The proposed project gives the
best classification in Beta range (16-31) Hz. The
classified task is then sent to the Arduino via socket
programming in Arduino- MATLAB interface. The task
value is then mapped to the servo movement, for task 1 it
rotates 90 degrees and for task 2, by 180 degrees. In this
manner, the task of up and down arm movement is
established.
1.1 Objective
The main and the utmost purpose of this work is to
implement robotic arm that is controlled totally by the
EEG signals. The Hand assistant is driven by the servo
motor, which is controlled totally by the EEG signals.
When the user enters any random input signal then, that
signal is compared with the database using classification
and the servo is then actuated according to the task
classified.

1.2 Motivation

University of Washington. The best part of this invention
is monkeys were trained to move a dial using the nerve
impulses which were recorded from their brain commands
[5]. In 1982, scientists were able to predict in which
direction a monkey’s limb is moving. This was done by
charging the motor cortex with electricity [6]. An
unimaginable discovery took place in 1998, where a
paralyzed man who cannot speak was able to do cursor
movement and selecting messages from a computer menu.
A paralyzed lady’s brain was screwed in the motor cortex
area of her brain, 2014. As a result of this, she was able to
move a robotic hand with her brain [7]. From the last
several decades, numerous studies have developed in
BCIs with the goals ranging from providing means of
communication to functional rehabilitation and in that
EEG based BCI systems plays important role for
communication and rehabilitation [8].

The field of EEG and BCI, widely recognized as the
current challenge for Machine Learning and Neural
Network, is attracting the interest of many researchers.
People who are paralyzed have to depend on others for
getting their work done. The proposed project makes the
paralyzed people independent. The work is not limited for
these people but it can be used in many areas, such as
gaming, virtual reality, also in the research areas for
helping scientists, to work with the hazardous materials.

2 Literature Survey
The Electroencephalography (EEG) is the process that
records electrical activity of the brain. On the scalp with
conductive gel electrodes are placed to obtain EEG
signals. The electrical activity done due to ion exchange
in brain cells and it is the measure of current flow from
the summated activity of number of neurons in our brain.
The EEG signals recorded after placing electrodes on
scalp having the range from 0-200 micro-volts. EEG
waves, also called as brain rhythms are classified
according to the frequency, amplitude and shape of the
scalp at which they are recorded. The EEG waveforms are
mainly classified in five classes as alpha waves, beta
waves, theta waves, delta waves and gamma waves. These
waves are identified by frequency (Hz or cycles/sec) and
amplitude.

3 Proposed Methodology
The block diagram shown in Fig. 1 consists of Data
Acquisition of EEG signals, EEG signal overlapping,
Feature Extraction, Training Dataset Creation,
Classification, Arduino- MATLAB interface and Servo
Motor. The Feature Extraction is performed on the EEG
signal acquired from the PhysioBank, in MATLAB. The
classified task obtained from KNN classifier is mapped to
the servo movements.

Alpha waves were discovered by German neurologist
Hans Berger. Alpha waves occur at frequencies between
8-13 Hz. The alpha waves are generally associated with
relaxation and are originated from the occipital lobe of
brain during wakeful relaxation while eyes are closed.
During deep sleep, the alpha waves get disappear. Beta
waves occur at frequencies between 13-30Hz. In alert
state of the individual these waves occurred and also
occurred during deep sleep. Beta wave represents
alertness and tension with that it also associated with
remembering the memories. Theta waves occur at
frequencies between 4-7 Hz. These waves normally occur
in children, but they also occur in some adults during
emotional stress. The individuals having brain disorders
and often in degenerative brain states these theta waves
occur. Delta waves occur at frequencies between 0.5-4Hz
and during very deep sleep these delta waves occur.
Gamma waves have frequencies from 35Hz and above.
They are most energetic waves and have the smallest
amplitude. The higher frequency wave beta is more
prominent when eyes are open and closed thus beta waves
were considered for the further processing and feature
extraction of the signals [3].

3.1 Data Acquisition
The EEG signal dataset is collected from the PhysioBank
ATM. This data set consists of over 1500 one-minute
EEG recording ad it is obtained from 109 volunteers. 64
channel electrode system were used to record EEG using
BC2000 while subjects performing different motor tasks.
The Bank mentioned four tasks, out of which for this
project we opted two tasks which are-(1) Baseline, eye
open and (2) Baseline, eye close. Out of the 64 channels
the 5 electrodes are taken into consideration i.e., AF3,
AF4, T7, T8 and Pz. The signals are saved in .mat format
for the ease of computation in MATLAB for further
processing, that is performing feature extraction.

From past many years, the researchers are very curious in
the field of BCI and EEG signal processing. In late, 1870,
the Motor Cortex part of the Brain was discovered.
Scientist applied electricity to this part of the dog’s brain
and it resulted in the movement of limbs [4]. The first
Brain Machine Interface was invented in the year 1969 in

3.2 EEG Signal Overlapping and Window Size

𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 ∑𝑁𝑁
𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 |𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 ,𝑘𝑘𝑘 , 𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝑗 𝑗 𝑗 𝑗 𝑗 𝑗𝑗

After collecting the EEG signals these signals were
overlapped with window size of 750ms. The entire
windowing technique and framing is applied to all the
electrodes separately [9]. The first window size is the
largest and it is same as size of the EEG signal. After that
subsequent steps include reducing the previous window
size by half and same will be repeated until getting the
smallest windows size of 1 second. This is due to 160
sample/second sampling rate. The Hamming window is
selected for 50 percent overlapping so that any particular
information is not lost. Since we are performing
overlapping and due to the spectral plot of the Hamming
window, it provides the entire signal information with the
best accuracy.

where Cj, k is the detail coefficients or approximation
coefficients and N denotes the number of wavelet
coefficients at each level of decomposition. The energy of
the wavelet packet is normalized by comparing the energy
of detail with total energy of the signal according to Eq.

𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 = ∑𝑘𝑘 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸

The important step in this work is the feature extraction.
The total accuracy, the final output will be affected if
the accuracy of the dataset obtained from feature
extraction is not achieved. In EEG signals essential
information is present at low frequency range generally
between 0 to 50 Hz so multilevel wavelet decomposition
was performed on EEG signals. The decomposition is
multi layered indicates the frequency element and for the
next process it increases the signal information. The
feature extraction is done using discrete wavelet
transform with 3 level of decomposition. In discrete
wavelet transform dynamic scales and positions are
utilized for extracting the features and defined in Eq. (1)
as follows [10]:

𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸

The total energy Et of the signal is calculated according to
Eq. (4) as follows:

3.3 Feature Extraction

𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷(𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝑗𝑗) = ∫−∞ 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥

(2)

(4)

This process is continued to generate the relative wavelet
entropy. Wavelet entropy is used to calculate the degree
of similarity between different EEG signal segments. The
total wavelet entropy is calculated as per Eq. (5) as
follows:

𝐺𝐺(𝑥𝑥) = − ∑𝑗𝑗 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃,𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃,𝑘𝑘

(5)

To characterize, the variability and most importantly the
location of the dataset, the inclusion of skewness and
kurtosis has been done. The measure of symmetry or more
precisely the lack of symmetry is the skewness. A
symmetricity is there between distribution and dataset if
it resembles the same in both left and right from the centre
point and it is expressed according to Eq. (6) as follows:

(1)

where 2j*k is time localization and 2j is scale respectively,
while x(t) represents the mother wavelet function.
Daubechies (db4) wavelet is selected as the mother
wavelet function, using sampling rate 160 sample/second
EEG signals are decomposed and it provides the result
into 5 bands as delta (0.5-4Hz); Theta (4-7Hz); Alpha (813Hz); Beta (13-30Hz); and Gamma (35-63Hz) and rest
is noise. Then energy will be extracted from related
frequency bands. Out of the 5 frequency band, only Beta
Band is utilized. In this stage, since the work is with the
Beta Waves, the selection of cd3 coefficient has been
taken into consideration, which is nothing but a detailed
coefficient. The most important part
of this feature
extraction stage is calculating the features and
corresponding values mapping into the database. Features
like Mean, Minimum, Variance, Standard Deviation,
Entropy, Skewness, Kurtosis have been calculated for cd3
coefficient of each electrode. The Energy of wavelet
coefficients is calculated for approximation and detail
according to Eq. (2) as follows [11]:

𝑠𝑠 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠

(𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥3
𝜎𝜎 3

(6)

where µ is the mean value of x, σ is the standard deviation
value of x, and E(t) shows the expected value of the
quantity t and the sample version of this population value
is calculated from skewness. Kurtosis is used to measure
whether the data are heavy tailed or light tailed relative to
a normal distribution. If lighter the tails, then lower is the
Kurtosis. Similarly, if heavier the tail, then higher is the
Kurtosis. The kurtosis of a distribution is calculated
according to Eq. (7) as follows:

𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘

(𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥4
𝜎𝜎 4

(7)

The Kurtosis is used to calculate the sample version of
population value.

3.4 Training dataset Creation

4 Components

For 20 subjects and for total 2 tasks, 40 samples are
created in the database for total 8 features. This database
is obtained automatically by running the MATLAB script,
and loaded in the form of a matrix. This Dataset is used
for training purpose in the classification. Any random
signal is compared with this standard database.

4.1 Arduino Uno Board
Arduino Uno is AT-mega328 microcontroller based
board. In this work, Arduino Uno receives command on
one of the 14 digital input/output pin and then on the same
pin servo motor is connected. This command is crucial to
Rotate the servo motors accordingly. Thus based on the
classifier output servo motors are being controlled with
the help of Arduino.

3.5 Classification
Classification is the most important step for insuring the
proper working of the system. There is a need to classify
whether the task is eyes open or eyes closed. For
classification of these tasks K-Nearest Neighbour
classifier is used. KNN is a supervised classification
method and it is a nonlinear classifier [12]. It uses class
labels for training data. KNN makes prediction directly
using the training dataset. It is the simple algorithm that
stores training dataset of different classes or tasks and
classifies new classes/tasks based on similarity measure
(e.g. distance functions). In this the standard training
dataset and the group matrix is provided with task labels.
Further random sample is provided to the classifier and
the classification is done based on distance functions.
There are different types of distance functions such as
Euclidean, cityblock, cosine, correlation and hamming.
City block distance is used in classifier to get better
accuracy of the classification. Another name for city
block distance is Manhattan distance. It represents the
absolute difference between co-ordinates of pair of
objects. City Block distance is calculated according to Eq.
(8) as follows:

∑𝑘𝑘𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 |𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 − 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 |

4.2 Servo Motor
A Servo Motor is basically a rotary mover or actuator
which allows user to do precision control of linear or
angular position, velocity and acceleration. Servo motors
work upon a feedback system and therefore they are often
referred to as motors suitable for working in Closed loop
system. A servo motor has inbuilt motor, feedback circuit
and motor driver. To use servo motor it needs power line,
ground, and control pin. Through control pin, servo motor
can be made to rotate upto 180 degrees. Therefore, a high
torque servo motors are used for arm and finger
movements respectively.

5 Software Implementation
The main steps for operating the robotic arm with BCI are
shown in Fig. 2. The first step is to acquire the standard
database from PhysioBank. After collecting the database,
the signal processing is performed on it. Matlab R2017a
has been used for the processing of the EEG signal and its
classification. For Matlab-Arduino interfacing Support
Packages of Arduino Hardware were installed on the
System. This enabled the complete access of Arduino
board on Matlab.

(8)

Based on the random input provided to the system, KNN
classifier does comparison with the standard dataset and
provides the output [13]. The classification between the
two classes is then obtained and the information is then
given as command to Arduino to control the movements
of the servo motor.
3.6 Arduino MATLAB interface
The Arduino MATLAB interface is the last stage of this
proposed work wherein, the computed and classified task
is communicated to the Arduino via the MATLAB script.
The Arduino Hardware packages are readily installed in
the MATLAB R2017a. By simple connecting the Arduino
board to a specific com port and mentioning the same in
the MATLAB script, the servo motor is actuated
according to the task. For example, for task 1 the arm
rotates by 180 degrees and the wrist by 90 degrees. The
rotation can be provided according to one’s convenience.

corresponding to the different tasks is recorded and
features are extracted from them. After that the
classification among different tasks is done by using KNN
classifier. The system is trained based on the signals
collected from the Emotive Insight Headset. Based on the
random input provided to the system, first the features are
extracted from this input and then KNN classifier does
comparison with the standard dataset and provides the
output.
The output from the signal processing is then send to the
digital input/output pin of Arduino onto which servo
motors are connected. The interfacing of robotic arm is
shown in Fig. 4. This output acts as a control command
for the servo motors and the rotatory movement is
performed according to the tasks.

7 Conclusion

The original EEG signal collected from Emotive Insight
headset from the recording electrodes as shown in Fig. 3.
The Emotiv Insight headset has an inbuilt EEG amplifier
and ADC converter. The digitized data of EEG signal
send to a computer system via Bluetooth in 2.4 GHz band.
The EEG output having the frequency range of 0.2 to 45
Hz. The digitized EEG data doesn’t need to be filtered as
Emotive Insight headset itself contains notch filters of
frequency range 50Hz and 60Hz to reject the power
supply frequency.

The prototype of robotic arm using BCI has been
successfully developed and tested. The objective of the
proposed work was to develop such a system that would
help the paralyzed person work in similar fashion to a
normal human being where the arm movement done by
the brain signals. This system is useful for the paralyzed
person whose brain functions properly. After extracting
and processing EEG signals suitably, the movement of
robotic arm can be designed to move in the direction
according to the user brain commands. The applications
of BCI are unbounded, similarly the applications and
scope of improvement of proposed system is unbounded.
As the number of brain commands increases, the more
degree of freedom can be taken into consideration for the
robotic arm movement. The same idea can be used to
develop a BCI controlled Robotic leg.
