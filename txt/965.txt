Abstract. In this paper we develop a game-theoretic model of ambiguous pronoun resolution, namely, the pronoun reference is not clearly determined in the
context. We propose that iterated best response (IBR) reasoning offers a reasonable solution to ambiguous pronoun processing. Using electroencephalogram
(EEG) (14 channels) to investigate Chinese processing, we provide evidence
that the processes of resolving ambiguous and unambiguous pronouns are signiﬁcantly different at both neural and behavioural level. The differences mainly
manifest in longer reaction time and signals collected from the channels O1 (left
occipital cortex) and P8 (right inferior parietal cortex), which are activated during probabilistic expected utility generation. These ﬁndings are consistent with
general assumptions of our model that ambiguous pronoun resolution involves a
mechanism of decision-making.

Introduction

Personal pronouns such as he and she refer to an earlier mentioned person in the context. Pronoun resolution is a fundamental process in daily language processing, and
many linguistic studies have investigated how people assign a referent to a pronoun according to grammatical rules (see [1–4]). These researches have shown that some types
of linguistic cues can be used to pronoun resolution including: gender, verb-bias, focus

and so on. However, pronouns carry little content by nature, and thus are referentially
ambiguous in certain cases. Compare, for example, the following sentences:
(1) The wife stopped the husband. She cried.
(2) The owner blamed the waiter. He was angry.
In (1), the gender information of the nouns help to identify pronoun denotation, and
therefore the pronoun she must refer to the wife. In this case, the pronoun’s referent
is determined by some linguistic cues (here, gender), and we call it the unambiguous
pronoun. While in (2), gender is not informative to determine the pronoun’s referent, we
call it the ambiguous pronoun. The pronoun he in (2) may either refer to the owner or the
waiter, and its referent is undetermined. Another linguistic cue that may help pronoun
resolution is the verb-bias, that is, the semantic meaning of the verb may lead to a bias
for pronoun interpretation. In a seminal work of psycholinguistics on pronouns, Garvey
& Caramazza [1] have reported strong bias in pronoun resolution for speciﬁc verbs.
They found a strong bias in interpreting she as a reference of the object the daughter
for the verb scold (e.g. The mother scolded her daughter becasuse she . . . ), while she
referring to the subject the mother for the verb confess (e.g. The mother confessed to her
daughter becasuse she . . .). This suggests that people do not simply decide the referent
of an ambiguous pronoun by proximity.
Unambiguous expressions show prima facie advantages comparing to their ambiguous counterparts. Actually, the pronoun he as shown in sentence (2) is more brief than
the deﬁnite descriptions the owner or the waiter. Brevity is commonly argued as a rationality principle in communication. Grice’s [5] Maxims of Conversation have shown
this tension between brevity and ambiguity: Maxim of Quantity and Maxim of Manner.
Therefore, it is worthy of discussion about the rationale of the use of ambiguous expressions in daily communication. The present work assumes that ambiguous pronoun
processing involves rational decision-making, which can be modelled in game theory.
The tradition of applying game models to pragmatics can be traced back to the seminal
work of David Lewis [6]. Lewis introduced signalling games, which characterize communication as a speaker’s attempt to inﬂuence a hearer’s action by sending a certain
signal. On the basis of Lewisian tradition, Parikh [7, 8] developed a more comprehensive framework named games of partial information. Parikhian model has been applied
to analyze reference resolution (see [9, 10]). Clark and Parikh [10] adopted the conception of Pareto Nash Equilibrium to solve the game of ambiguous reference. Another
branch of game-theoretic pragmatics couches iterative dynamics as an analysis of rational language use (see for example [11–13]). An inﬂuential model of iterated response
reasoning is the so called pragmatic back-and-forth reasoning developed by Franke and
Jäger [13]. Recently, the dynamic reasoning model has been applied to an analysis of
ambiguous expressions [14].
In this paper, we develop a game-theoretic model of ambiguous pronoun resolution. The model includes two parts: a signalling game as an illustration of the situations
where people process ambiguous pronouns, and a reasoning account as a solution of
the game. We point out that the solution conception of Parikhian model requiring the
agents being rational enough to select the most proﬁtable strategies is too constrictive.
To solve the game of ambiguous pronoun, we introduce the iterated best response (IBR)

reasoning. We argue that IBR reasoning by assuming a step-by-step interactive reasoning procedure allows analyzing actions under bounded rationality.
It is arguable whether the cognitive processing of pronoun resolution only involves
the core language network or it also recruits the network of strategic decision-making
as suggested in our model . To test the assumptions of our model, we use electroencephalogram (EEG) (14 channels) to study ambiguous pronoun processing in Chinese.
Though recent years some work has been done on neural measures of reference resolution (see[15–19]), neural correlates to ambiguous pronoun resolution remain greatly
uncharacterized. In our experiments, participants observed a sentence containing two
nouns followed by the other sentence containing a personal pronoun (for example, sentence (1)). Behavioural data including reaction time (the time consumed by a participant
to identify a pronoun referent) and neural data including EEG signals of 4 frequency
bands and 14 channels during the whole resolution procedures are recorded. These data
suggest a signiﬁcant difference between processes of ambiguous and unambiguous pronoun resolution. The neural data of channel P8 and O1 demonstrate more activated recruitment of right inferior parietal cortex and left occipital cortex during ambiguous
pronoun resolution. According to a review of neuroimaging studies (see [20, 21, 18]),
these areas respectively implicate expected utility calculation under probabilistic situations and extra effort paid for entire sentence reading. These ﬁndings are consistent with
the assumptions of our model that ambiguous pronoun resolution involves a mechanism
of decision-making. Our work also extends previous research on English processing to
Chinese processing, which is structurally different from English. The results indicate
that game-theoretic model can be applied across languages, and encourage further generalization of the model in future research.

A Game-Theretic Model to Ambiguous Pronoun Resolution

In this section, we will ﬁrst construct a game-theoretic model, and then apply it to
the case of ambiguous pronoun resolution. The model follows the main assumptions
from the tradition of Gricean pragmatics (see [5]): communication is considered to be a
cooperative and rational activity. The model presented in this paper will consider about
a basic case that involves just one ambiguous message. The current model is aiming at
offering a brief guideline to analyze ambiguous pronoun resolution and is competent
to explain the rationale of the pragmatics in cases such as sentence (2). To analyze
more complicated sentences with more than one ambiguous pronouns would require an
extended model which can be derived from the basic model in principle. However, the
development of an extended model has gone beyond the present work.
2.1

The Model

Context Modelling In the model, we assume that there is a speaker S, who has the
relevant information about the world where she is in, and a hearer H, who has to judge
about the world by reasoning on the message that the speaker transmits. Assuming there
are two possible worlds: w1 and w2 , we now model the speaker’s knowledge about the
world as types: t1 indicates that S knows that she is in w1 , t2 indicates that S knows

50

Mengyuan Zhao et al.

that she is in w2 . We introduce Nature, say N, as an impersonal player of the game. N
chooses a move to either type, say t ∈ T , with a probability, say p. Let Pr(t) ∈ Δ (T )
be prior distribution over types, where Δ (T ) refers to a probability distribution over
types t1 ,t2 , . . . ,tn . We assume that p = Pr(t) implicates H’s prior belief in t before
receiving any message. S will send a message, say m ∈ M, to H to inform her about the
world, and H will interpret the received message into a type of S. We assume that the
players will play according to the sematic meaning of messages. This constraint can be
shown by introducing a lexicon B that maps type-message pair to the Boolean truthvalue of the message for the speaker’s type. A minimal lexicon fragment that involves
choices between ambiguous and unambiguous messages is one with two types and three
messages, where B(t1 , m1 ) = B(t1 , m̄) = 1, B(t2 , m2 ) = B(t2 , m̄) = 1. Put into words, for
type t1 , S may either send an unambiguous message containing a deﬁnite description,
say m1 , or send an ambiguous message containing a pronoun, say m̄. Similarly, for type
t2 , S may send an unambiguous message m2 or an ambiguous message m̄. Accordingly,
we assume that the speaker will play a semantically consistent strategy, say σ , which is
deﬁned as follows:
Deﬁnition 1. A semantically consistent strategy of the speaker σ is a function that
maps each speaker type t ∈ T to a probability of each message m ∈ M to be sent in t,
given that m is semantically true in t: σ ∈ Δ (M)T , B(t, m) = 1.
Thereafter, H will interpret m1 into t1 , m2 into t2 . And when H receives m̄, she may
possibly interpret it into either m1 or m2 . Accordingly, we assume that the hearer will
also play a semantically consistent strategy, say ρ, which is deﬁned as follows:
Deﬁnition 2. A semantically consistent strategy of the hearer ρ is a function that maps
each message m to a probability of each interpretation t to be chosen, given that m is
semantically true in t: ρ ∈ Δ (T )M , B(t, m) = 1.
We further assume that a successful communication using a pronoun will provide
players with an extra gain, say ε, since the communication is complete with less words.
We assume that S and H are purely cooperative, in the sense that S and H share the
same utility functions. It means that both S and H would prefer that H’s interpretation
of m, say t j , is identical to S’s type, say ti . We deﬁne the utility functions of players as
follows.
Deﬁnition 3. Let UN (ti , m,t j ) be payoff of N ∈ {S, H} given ti , m and t j , where i, j =
1, 2.
⎧
1, if i = j and m ∈ {m1 , m2 }
⎨
.
UN (ti , m,t j ) = 1 + ε, if i = j and m = m
⎩
0, if i = j
Deﬁnition 3 suggests: Both players will gain a plain payoff, say 1, using unambiguous messages; both will gain an extra payoff, say 1+ε, if H correctly understands the
ambiguous pronoun message; and both will earn 0, if H misinterprets the pronoun. We
denote by p ∈ (0, 1) H’s prior belief that S is of type t1 , i.e. Pr(t1 ) = p. The game tree
in Fig. 1 illustrates the signalling game of our model.

Solution Modelling As a solution of the game, we introduce the IBR reasoning framework. The IBR reasoning includes two reasoning sequences, namely, the S0 -sequence
and the H0 -sequence. In the S0 -sequence, the ﬁrst step of reasoning starts from a level-0
speaker, say S0 . We assume that S0 is a naı̈ve speaker, in the sense that she will choose
a random message that is semantically consistent with her type. The level-1 hearer, say
H1 will play rationally based on her belief in S0 , in the sense that H1 will choose the
strategy that offers her the best expected utility. Similarly, S2 will play rationally based
on her belief in H1 , and the reasoning continues in this way. In the H0 -sequence, the ﬁrst
step will be taken by a level-0 hearer, say H0 . H0 will choose the strategy that offers her
the best expected utility based on her posterior belief in the speaker’s strategy. In other
words, we assume that H0 , unlike S0 , is rational. The level-1 speaker, say S1 will play
rationally according to her belief in H0 , and so on. As a generalization, a level-(k + 1)
player will play rationally according to her belief in the strategies that a level-k player
will choose. Now we illustrate by induction the IBR reasoning scaffolding.
Naı̈ve Levels The S0 -sequence starts from the level-0 speaker S0 , who will randomly
play a semantically consistent strategy. According to Deﬁnition 1, S0 may choose either
m1 or m̄ in t1 , and she may choose either m2 or m̄ in t2 . We perspicuously list all possible
choices of S0 for both types as follows.

S0 = 1
t2 → m2 , m̄

52

Mengyuan Zhao et al.

The H0 -sequence starts from the level-0 hearer H0 , who will play rationally according to her posterior belief. A posterior belief of H0 , say μ0 , results from the hearer’s prior
belief updated by the semantic meaning of the messages: μ0 (t|m) = Pr(t) × B(t, m). For
unambiguous messages m1 and m2 , H0 will choose semantic interpretations t1 and t2 ,
respectively. For the ambiguous message m̄, the posterior beliefs in two types are calculated as follows: μ0 (t1 |m̄) = Pr(t1 )×B(t1 , m̄) = p, μ0 (t2 |m̄) = Pr(t2 )×B(t2 , m̄) = 1− p.
H0 will choose any t with a higher posterior belief as an interpretation of m̄ . This means
H0 ’s interpretation of the ambiguous message is dependent on the value of p, which represents the hearer’s prior belief in speaker’s types.

Sophisticated Levels We assume that in both S0 - and H0 -sequences, level-(k + 1) player
will play as the best response to her belief in the other’s strategies (k > 0). For simplicity,
we assume that the players believe that their opponents are of the level that is exactly
one level lower than her own. For the level-(k + 1) speaker, her belief is given as the
semantically consistent strategies (see Deﬁnition 2) of the level-k hearer, say ρk . We
further assume that the speaker will give a best response to her belief, say Br(ρ). A best
response means a rational play, namely, the speaker will choose a pure strategy, say s(t),
that will maximize her expected utility. The speaker’s expected utility, say EUS (t, m, ρ),
can be calculated as follows.
EUS (t, m, ρ) =

∑ ρ(ti |m) ×US (t, m,ti )

(1)

ti ∈T

As shown in Equation (1), the expected utility of the speaker is a sum of the utilities
(see Deﬁnition 3) of all possible outcomes weighted by their probabilities dependent on
the speaker’s belief. Accordingly, the speaker’s strategy as a best response of her belief
is as follows.
s(t) = BR(ρ) ∈ arg max EUS (t, m, ρ)
m∈M

(2)

As for the level-(k + 1) hearer, her belief is given as the posterior belief, say μk+1 ,
which is derived from the hearer’s prior belief and the semantically consistent strategies
(see Deﬁnition 1) of the level-k speaker, say σk , by Bayesian conditionalization.
μk+1 (t j |mi ) =

Pr(t j ) × σk (mi |t j )
∑t  ∈T Pr(t  ) × σk (mi |t  )

(3)

In Equation (3), the Bayesian conditionalization represents the belief dynamics: the
likelihood for each type t is computed after a certain message m is received in t given

EEG Evidence for Game-Theoretic Model to Ambiguous Pronoun Resolution

53

prior probability of t and the expected probability of m to be sent in t. We assume that
the hearer will show a best response to her belief, say Br(μ). A best response of a
hearer is a pure strategy, say h(t), that will maximize her expected utility. The hearer’s
expected utility, say EUH (t, m, μ), can be calculated as follows.
EUH (t, m, μ) =

∑ μ1 (ti |m) ×UH (ti , m,t)

(4)

ti ∈T

In Equation (4), the hearer’s expected utility is a sum of the utilities (see Deﬁnition
3) of all possible outcomes weighted by their probabilities dependent on the hearer’s
belief. Accordingly, the hearer’s strategy as a best response of her belief is as follows.
h(m) = BR(μ) ∈ arg max EUH (t, m, μ)
t∈T

(5)

Now we start reasoning in the S0 -sequence. After S0 sends a certain m to H1 , the
latter will respond based on her posterior belief in S0 , say μ1 (t|m). From Equations
(3) and (4), we calculate H1 ’s expected utilities of different choices while receiving m̄:
EUH1 (t1 , m̄, μ1 ) = p × (1 + ε), EUH1 (t2 , m̄, μ1 ) = (1 − p) × (1 + ε). From equation (5),
H1 will interpret m̄ into t1 if and only if EUH1 (t1 , m̄, μ1 ) > EUH1 (t2 , m̄, μ1 ), requiring
p > 12 . Thus, the strategy of H1 can be perspicuously illustrated as follows.

Accordingly, h1 (m) can be calculated from Equation (5): h1 (t1 |m1 ) = h1 (t2 |m2 ) =
h1 (t1 |m̄) = 1, if p > 12 ; h1 (t1 |m1 ) = h1 (t2 |m2 ) = h1 (t2 |m̄) = 1, if p < 12 . S2 will respond
upon her belief, say ρ1 , which is equal to h1 . From equations (4) and (5), we illustrate
S2 ’s strategies as follows.

Accordingly, s2 (t) can be computed from Equation (2): h1 (m̄|t1 ) = h1 (m2 |t2 ) =
1, if p > 12 ; h1 (m1 |t1 ) = h1 (m̄|t2 ) = 1, if p < 12 . H3 will give the best response upon
her posterior belief in S2 , and her strategy can be ﬁgured out following a similar procedure of what happens in the case of H1 . We perspicuously illustrate H3 ’s strategy as
follows.

It is clear that H3 shows the same strategic pattern as H1 . Given the reasoning principles of best response operation, S4 should play the same as S2 , H5 should play the same
as H3 and so on. This means the strategies of the players start to repeat themselves from
the level-3 hearer after two rounds of best response reasoning in the S0 -sequence. And
it is also easy to reach similar results in the H0 -sequence, of which we would like to
skip the details for the sake of simplicity.
Predictions In our model, both the sets T and M are ﬁnite, therefore, there are ﬁnitely
many pure strategies. This means the IBR reasoning sequences will deﬁnitely repeat
themselves at a certain level. We deﬁne an idealized prediction of IBR reasoning as
follows.
Deﬁnition 4. The idealized predictions of IBR reasoning are inﬁnitely repeated strategies S∗ and H ∗ :
S∗ = {s ∈ S|∃i∀ j > i : s ∈ S j }
H ∗ = {h ∈ H|∃i∀ j > i : h ∈ H j }
From the steps that we have shown in the S0 -sequence, the strategy repetition begins
after two rounds of reasoning. And it is also easy to prove that a reasoning of H0 sequence will lead to similar results. Accordingly, we provide a prediction of our model
in Proposition 1:

Proposition 1 suggests: Whether an ambiguous pronoun is used instead of an unambiguous noun is dependent on the hearer’s prior belief in the frequency of the world
where the speaker is in . When the hearer believes that it is more likely for the speaker
be in the world w1 , where S is of type t1 , the speaker will send a pronoun message for t1
and a noun message for t2 , and the hearer will successfully translate the pronoun message into t1 . And the same reasoning will also stand in the case where the hearer’s prior
belief is biased towards t2 .

Comparison with other Models

Gricean Approches The game-theoretic model of ambiguous pronoun resolution presented here is highly in the spirit of Gricean pragmatics (see [5]). Grice accounted for
pragmatical reasoning as a rational behaviour of agents. Pronoun resolution has been
explained by application of the Gricean or neo-Gricean approaches (see for example
[22, 23]). Our game model follows Grice’s idea by modelling inferences of ambiguous
pronoun resolution as rational interaction between the speaker and the hearer.
The differences between our model and the Gricean approaches are mainly in two
aspects. Firstly, in the conceptual aspect, the game model presented in this paper does
not rely on a formulation of Grice’s Maxim of Conversation. The game model is constructed based on a simple assumption of cooperation in the sense that both of the players share a common interest. And this cooperation is formalized in terms of the utility
functions (see Deﬁnition 3). Furthermore, our model also leaves open the possibility of
explaining non-cooperative situations by a revision of utility functions. Secondly, in the
epistemic aspect, the model presented here uses an iterated best response reasoning to
show epistemic concerns of which the Gricean approaches are lack. The IBR reasoning
have three features: semantic meaning focus, step-by-step interactive pattern and tolerance of bounded rationality. These features correspond to actual epistemic situations.
IBR reasoning starts from level-0 players, who select according to the semantic meaning of the messages. The semantic meaning acts as a psychological focus of the agents
during the reasoning, that is, the agents are psychologically attracted by the semantic
meaning, from which they start the pragmatic reasoning. The IBR model also simulates a step-by-step interactive reasoning. This framework allows agents to update their
belief in each other’s rational strategies, and to upgrade their reasoning level. In addition, IBR reasoning is tolerant to limited rationality, which shows a more real situation.
The model offers freedom to stop at any level of sophistication to check the result of
reasoning from either bounded or ideal rationality.
Games of Partial Information A game of partial information involves ambiguous
information states in the game tree and is to be solved by adoption of Pareto-Nash
Equilibrium (see [7, 8]). It has been applied to the analysis of pronoun resolution (see
[9, 10]). Games of partial information share the same tradition of game-theoretic pragmatics with the model presented in this paper.
The difference between the model presented here and the games of partial information is mainly in the aspect of solution concepts. The games of partial information adopt
the solution concept of Pareto-Nash Equilibrium. A Pareto-dominant Nash Equilibrium
is the best-paid strategy proﬁle among those which offer both players the best payoff
given the strategy of her opponent. In other words, the Pareto-Nash Equilibrium is the
most proﬁtable equilibrium of the game. To follow this, it is required that the agents
compute all equilibria and make the comparison as well. This requirement not only
is too much for the rationality of the agents, but also presumes an outsider’s view of
the game to complete the calculation. In comparison, our model adopts the solution of
IBR reasoning predictions. The IBR reasoning illustrates a step-by-step interaction. It
allows the agents to respond from different levels of sophistication with more tolerance
to the rationality of the players. It also shows as a simulation of the real procedure of

56

Mengyuan Zhao et al.

the agents updating their belief and responding to it . Therefore, the IBR reasoning is
more like an insider’s view of the game.
Pragmatic Back-and-Forth Reasoning The back-and-forth reasoning combines the
idea of signalling games as the context formulation and iterated response reasoning as
the solution schemes (see [12, 13]). It has been applied to analyze the resolution of
ambiguous reference (see [14]). The model presented here bear a close resemblance to
the back-and-forth reasoning.
The difference between our model and the back-and-forth reasoning is mainly in
two points. Firstly, as for the context modelling, the back-and-forth reasoning uses signalling games to describe the context of a sender sending messages to inform a receiver
about the state t. Instead, in our model, we use t to represent the type of the speaker, who
will send a message to inform the hearer about her knowledge of the world. Comparing
to the settings of the back-and-forth reasoning, our model is capable of representing the
speaker’s expertise, and thus leaves open the possibility that the speaker has only partial
information of the world. Secondly, as for the solution modelling, the back-and-forth
reasoning includes at least three types of iterated response reasoning schemas: iterated best response, iterated cautious response and iterated quantal response. Our model
adopts a solution concept that is most close to the iterated best response in Franke’s
work (see [12]). In the vanilla IBR model, Franke assumed that the receiver would show
unbiased prior beliefs in all states. In comparison, our work intruduces a parameter p
to represent the hearer’s prior belief in different speaker types. This parameter is key to
our model in the sense that it determines the ﬁnal solution to the game. Furthermore,
the parameter of prior belief also plays an important role both in our pretest work and
in the experiments (see Section 3 for details).
2.3

The Application

Game-theoretic models have been applied to various pragmatic phenomenons (see [24–
26] for a selective survey). However, most researches are based on an analysis of English sentences. We explore our game-theoretic model to an analysis of Chinese, which
is structurally different from English. We ﬁrst construct 200 pairs of Chinese sentences
dividing into different groups, then we investigate the value of prior belief in the referent
of ambiguous pronouns based on a 30-participant survey.
We construct 200 pairs of sentences through the following steps: We ﬁrst identify 80
nouns, 40 of which are gender-biased (for example, qizi ‘wife’) and the other 40 genderneutral (for example, laoshi ‘teacher’); we then generate meaningful 200 sentences by
pairing nouns with a transitive verb (for example, piping ‘blame’); we ﬁnally generate
200 sentences including a pronoun and an intransitive verb (for example, xiao ‘smile’).
We divide the 200 pairs of sentences into different classes according to a group of characteristics. A main classiﬁcation is to distinguish between ambiguous and unambiguous
pronoun resolution. For example, compare the following pairs of sentences:
(3) Qizi lanzhu zhangfu. Ta
ku-le.
wife stop husband. She cry ASP.
‘The wife stopped the husband. She cried.’

(4) Dianzhang piping fuwuyuan. Ta shengqi-le.
owner
blame waiter.
He angry ASP.
‘The owner blamed the waiter. He was angry.’
The pronoun in (3) unambiguously refers to the wife, while the pronoun in (4) may
either refer to the owner or the waiter. Our model can be applied to analyze ambiguous
pronoun resolution as shown in example sentences (4). Since the hearer’s prior belief is
key to solve the game as shown in Proposition 1, we conduct a pretest survey to investigate how the verb-bias as a linguistic cue inﬂuence people’s resolution to ambiguous
pronouns. 30 healthy young adults from University of Shanghai for Science and Technology participated in the survey. We replace the nouns of each sentences with X and Y
(for example, X piping Y. Ta shengqi-le. ‘X blamed Y. She was angry.’), and ask the participants whether the pronoun refers to X or Y. On average, the object noun is preferred
(74.5%).
We now apply the model to analyze the case shown in example sentences (4). Here
are two possible worlds: w1 , where the owner was angry, and w2 , where the waiter was
angry. Accordingly, the speaker’s types include: the speaker knows that she is in w1 , say
t1 , and she knows that she is in w2 , say t2 . From the survey analysis, the hearer’s prior
belief is biased towards t2 , that is, p < 12 . According to Proposition 1: If the speaker is
of t1 , she will utter The owner was angry; if the speaker is of t2 , she will utter He was
angry. The hearer, after receiving the message He was angry, will interpret it into t2 ,
namely, assigning the referent the waiter to the pronoun he.
The prediction of our analysis on ambiguous pronoun resolution is consistent with
the results of our EEG experiment, which will be illustrated in the next section.

The Experiment
Methods

10 healthy adults from University of Shanghai for Science and Technology participated
in the EEG experiment. All participants are native speaker of Chinese and right-handed.
We excluded one participant due to signiﬁcantly low accuracy rate of unambiguous
pronoun resolution results. Therefore, all data analyses are based on 9 healthy adults.
We ﬁrst construct 200 pairs of meaningful sentences in Chinese as described in Section 2.3. The sentences include both unambiguous pronouns and ambiguous pronouns.
We not only construct sentences with the syntactic structure of S+V+O, (e.g. sentences
(3) and (4)), but also construct pairs of sentences with unique syntactic structures of
Chinese, N1 +N2 +V. Consider, for example, the following sentences:
(5) Laoshi he yanjiuyuan yuehui. Ta xiao-le.
teacher and researcher date.
He smile ASP.
‘The teacher dated the researcher. He smiled.’
The sentences are displayed on a computer screen. For each experimental trial, a
ﬁxation cross (500ms) shows ﬁrst, and then three stimulus events follow (each 3000
ms). The ﬁrst stimulus event is the presentation of a sentence containing two nouns

58

Mengyuan Zhao et al.

(e.g., Qizi lanzhu zhangfu. ‘The wife stopped the husband.’). The second stimulus event
is the presentation of a sentence containing a pronoun (e.g., Ta ku-le. ‘She cried.’).
The last stimulus event is a question for participant to choose whether the pronoun
refers to the noun on he left (e.g. qizi ‘the wife’) or the noun on the right (e.g. zhangfu
‘the husband’). Participants are given up to 5500ms to respond, and their responses are
recorded by tapping a certain key on the keyboard (key z as choosing the left noun,
and key m for the right noun). All 200 pairs of sentences of either unambiguous classes
or ambiguous classes are pseudo-randomly distributed. The experimental procedure is
illustrated in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2. The experiment procedure

EEG was recorded by Emotiv Xavier SDK at a sampling rate of 128 Hz using 14
Cu electrodes, placing according to international 10-20 system. The frequency bands
included in EEG signals are as follows (see [27]): Theta (4-8 Hz), Alpha (8-12.5 Hz),
Beta(12.5-28 Hz), Gamma (30-40 Hz). The schematic representation of the 14-channel
positions is illustrated in Fig. 3(a).

Results and Discussion

We evaluate the response accuracy for the unambiguous pronoun resolution. The performance was highly accurate: M=95.8%. These results conﬁrm the efﬁcacy of gender
information as useful for pronoun resolution. To evaluate the uses of verb-bias information, we analyze the proportion of participants assigning the referent to preferred
object noun in the cases of ambiguous pronoun resolution. As predicted in the pretest
survey (see Section 2.3), participants prefer choosing the object as the referent of pronoun (M=69%). We also analyze the cases of ambiguous pronoun resolution with a
sentence structure of N1 +N2 +V, and participants show preference to the second noun
as the referent of the pronoun (M=62%).
We investigate reaction times of pronoun resolution of various classes. We ﬁnd that
there are signiﬁcant differences in reaction times between ambiguous and unambigu-

ous pronoun resolution in both sentence structures, namely S+V+O and N1 +N2 +V.
More speciﬁcally, we report signiﬁcant differences in reaction times collected from
all 9 participants while resolving the following three groups of comparisons: Firstly,
comparing unambiguous pronoun identiﬁed directly by both gender-biased nouns (e.g.,
sentences (3)) relative to ambiguous pronoun with the structure of S + V + O (e.g.,
sentences (4)) shows a p value of t-test much smaller than 0.01(p=0.000); secondly, unambiguous pronoun identiﬁed indirectly by a gender-biased noun and a gender-neural
noun (e.g., sentences (6)) versus ambiguous pronoun with the structure of S + V + O
(e.g., sentences (4)) (p=0.000); thirdly, unambiguous pronoun identiﬁed directly by
gender-biased nouns (e.g., sentences (8)) versus ambiguous pronoun with the structure
of N1 +N2 +V (e.g., sentences (5)) (p=0.000).
(6) Kuaiji

‘The accountant encouraged the daughter. He smiled.’
(7) Nüyanyuan he zhangfu zhengchao. Ta juezui-le.

‘The actress quarrelled with the husband. She pouted.’
To investigate the neural correlates of pronoun resolution, we compare EEG data
collected from 9 participants while processing unambiguous pronouns relative to the
data of ambiguous pronoun resolution. More speciﬁcally, we report signiﬁcant difference in EEG data collected from all 9 participants while resolving two groups of comparisons. Firstly, for EEG data collected from channel P8 for frequency bands Theta
and Alpha, signiﬁcant differences (p=0.005 for both frequency bands in signrank test)
have been reported comparing resolution of unambiguous pronoun identiﬁed directly
by gender-biased nouns (e.g., sentences (8)) relative to resolution ambiguous pronoun
with the structure of N1 +N2 +V (e.g., sentences (5)). This result is illustrated as box
plots in Fig. 3(c)-(d), where the signiﬁcant difference from channel P8 is highlighted
in red. Secondly, for EEG data collected from channel O1 for frequency bands Beta,
a signiﬁcant difference (p=0.006 in signrank test) has been reported comparing resolution of unambiguous pronoun identiﬁed directly by both gender-biased nouns (e.g.,
sentences (3)) relative to resolution ambiguous pronoun with the structure of S +V + O
(e.g., sentences (4)). This result is illustrated as box plots in Fig. 3(e)-(f), where the
signiﬁcant difference from channel O1 is highlighted in red.
The EEG signals from channels P8 and O1 are correlated with the recruitment of
right inferior parietal cortex and left occipital cortex (see [28]). Right inferior parietal
cortex is a region that has been correlated to an integration of of probabilistic assessment
and evaluation of expected utility (see [20, 18]). Activation in occipital cortex has been
reported as an increase of brain workload of the entire sentence reading (see [18]),
which can be explained as correlated to increased demands of language processing.

Conclusions and Outlook

In this paper, we construct a game-theoretic model for ambiguous pronoun resolution.
The behavioural ﬁndings suggest that people use gender information of nouns for pro-

noun resolution with high accuracy. When gender is not informative, people use verbbias information to resolve ambiguous pronouns. The experimental results are consistent with the assumptions and predictions of our model in three ways. Firstly, people
spending more time in ambiguous pronouns than unambiguous pronouns is consistent
with the assumption of our model that ambiguous pronoun resolution involves more
complicated and time-consuming cognitive procedures, namely, decision-making. Secondly, people’s consistent preference over object nouns in ambiguous pronoun resolution revealed in both pretest surveys and experiments is consistent with the prediction
of our model that the solution to the game of ambiguous pronoun resolution is dependent on hearer’s prior belief in speaker’s types. Thirdly, signiﬁcant differences shown in
EEG channel P8 (right inferior parietal cortex) and O1 (left occipital cortex) comparing
ambiguous to unambiguous pronoun processing implicates that the evaluation of probabilistic expected utilities are involved and accordingly increased demands of sentence
processing are also involved, which is consistent with the assumption of our model.
The experimental results shown in this paper offers evidence that the epistemic processing of ambiguous pronoun resolution involves not only the core language network
but also the network of strategic decision-making. These results coincide with the main
assumption of the game-theoretic model: agents are making strategic decisions according to their belief in expected utilities. However, due to the limitation of EEG settings,
it is extremely difﬁcult to collect as well as analyze the neural data from both a speaker
and a hearer at the same time during a conversation. To perform a closer test to the intersubjectivity of the agents assumed in the game model, the analysis can be further developed in the following two ways. First, to compare the predictions of the current model
with corpus study results. A corpus study may provide with sentences in a certain context, and it may help to distinguish a speaker’s intention from a hearer’s interpretation.
Second, to adopt psycholinguistic skills in the design of pretest. The psycholinguistic
skills may help to separate the role of the speaker from that of the hearer by setting the
pretest and the experiments apart.
