ABSTRACT
Nowadays, the technology advance has been allowed the development of new applications for brain computer
interfaces (BCI), due to its ability of detect brain activities (motor, cognitive, sensory) from a user that can be used to
control different movements or tasks of a device. This article has as objective, make an acquisition experiment of brain
signals associates with the imagined movement to left or right, later these signals will be filtered to extract the features
using the analysis of common spatial patterns (CSP) and the independent component analysis (ICA). Obtaining as a result,
a comparison of features extracted by each analysis and determining which method has a better accuracy in the
classification of two imagined movement tasks through support vector machines (SVM).
Keywords: independent component analysis, common spatial patterns, emotiv.

1. INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, due to the technology advance is
possible obtain encephalographic signals of a noninvasive
manner and with a response almost instantaneous for any
cognitive activity. Taking into account the previous
information and different control and identification
algorithms, are the reasons why the application of brain
computer interfaces has growing up in the last years.
For a best performance of these algorithms, the
brain signals should be filtered in the desired frequency
range, in order to discard additional signals. On the other
hand, one of the process with big development and variety
of methodologies is the feature extraction, this process is
critical for recognizing cognitive activities.
Among the different feature extraction
methodologies and its classification, is possible find works
as [7], where the performance of the technic of selforganizing maps was evaluated for classifying EEG
signals of the imagined movement of hands, classifying
correctly 80% of the EEG signals. The work made in [8]
makes a comparison between classification of imagined
movement by similitude with the real movement and the
self-organizing maps, increasing the recognition in a 50%
of the subjects studied through self-organizing maps.
The general applications of these algorithms
usually are for helping persons with physical disability.
For example, control a wheelchair through a brain
computer interface that relates two mental tasks with the
move forward or backward [9]. In this work the
classification of the signals were made using the linear
discriminant analysis (LDA), due to the low percentages
of error was possible include more commands for the
wheelchair movement.
The study of the different methods to classify
EEG signals of imagined movement was the objective in
[10], with the purpose of find the best method for
optimizing the BCI’s performance. As a conclusion of the
work, determined that the probabilistic neural network of

Parzen and SVM exceed the performance of Naïve
Bayesian Parzen Window.
In [11] evaluated different technics of
classification for EEG signals of motion imaginary. With
the development of this work was determined that the
support vector machines with Kernel Gaussian function is
one of the methods more powerful to classify, achieving
97% of accuracy in the classification of mental patterns.
Finally, a study of the performance of the features
based in the power of EEG signals in different frequencies
was made in [12], in order to identify a signal of imagined
movement and a signal of real movement. As a result, the
technics ICA and SVM had the better performance in
classification of the EEG signals.
2. METHODOLOGY
In order to make the classification of the brain
signals with a better accuracy, an acquisition experiment
was designed for capturing the encephalograms related
with the motion imagination, later these signals are filtered
and extract their features through CSP and ICA, all of this
with the purpose of train the support vector machines that
will classify the imagined movement to left or right, this
process is shown in Figure-1.

Figure-1. Problem statement.
The acquisition experiment of brain signals used
the Emotiv® sensor, this sensor has 14 channels located
according with the international standard 10-20.

without have information of

In order to solve this problem, the ICA defines an
“unmixing matrix”W from the measured data
, where
W is approximately the inverse of the mixing matrix
−
, transforming the equation 1 in equation 2.

Figure-2. Paradigm of signal acquisition.
The experiment consist in visualize a Cartesian
axis during 3 seconds and after shows a visual stimulus
during 3,5 seconds, this stimulus is for helping the user
imagine the movement to right or left. The previous
process is shown in Figure-2.

Taking into account the previous information is
possible define that the effect of an independent
component, is observably in the sensor projection from an
isolate component from the others, these projections are
given by the estimation of the mixing matrix as is shown
in equation 3.
̂=

Figure-3. Methodology used.
Each session of the acquisition paradigm lasts 65
seconds, in which take 10 samples of each imagined
movement and the experiment consists 10 sessions per
movement. With this data is applies the methodology
shown in Figure-3, which begins with a pass band filter
before of do the feature extraction through ICA and CSP,
necessary process for training the support vector machines
to classify the imagined movements.
The data take into account the 14 channels of the
Emotiv ® sensor that work with a sample frequency of
128Hz but according with the literature review, the
motion imagination occur in the alpha brain signals, that
have a frequency range of 8-12 Hz and in the beta brain
signals, that have a frequency range of 13-28Hz [7], [8].
For this reason the filter passband used comprise the
frequency band of 8-30Hz.
With the filtered data is used 2 analysis for
extracting features of each filtered sample. The first
analysis is the independent components analyses, which
seek transform different multivariate signals in a signal
that contain the common components statistically
independent of the signals [9].

The equation 1 is the basic representation of ICA
model, where
is the data measured continuously with
the Emotiv® and represented as vectors of n dimensions,
A is the matrix of maximum range called “the mixing
matrix” and
is the matrix of independent components
[10].
The ICA must calculate the independent
components
or estimate the matrix A from the

Each column of the − matrix represents the
spatial map of the relative projection weights of each EEG
channel, this means that the first column is the spatial map
of the first independent component and so on [12].
The second analysis used is the common spatial
patterns, which represents each signal with a matrix (∅)
composed by n x m, where nis the channels number and m
is the samples number per channel, with this information,
the spatial covariance of matrix (β) is calculated with the
equation 4 [13].
β=

Where ∅𝑇 ) is the transpose matrix, tr is the sum
of diagonal elements of ∅∅𝑇 ). This analysis seek define a
matrix X that with a βdetermine the diagonal of matrix A
for the imagined movement to left and matrix B for the
imagined movement to right, as is shown in equation 5.

Where A + B = I (identity matrix), lately the
spatial covariance is calculated through equation 6 [15].

Where β𝑐 = U𝑐 W𝑐 𝑈𝑐𝑇 and U𝑐 is the matrix of
eigenvectors and W𝑐 is the diagonal of the eigenvalues
matrix.
Finally, in this step is calculated the Whitening
transform represent by equation 7, where the variances in
the space embraced by U𝑐 are level [16].
With the variances leveled is possible define that
the eigen values (Y) are the same both the imagined
movement to left as right.
With these parameters is possible analyze the
common spatial patterns using equation 2 and rethink it

The CSP analysis uses the same number of
channels to extract features, this means that the analysis
determines a square matrix, where the first half are the
features of matrix A and the other half are the features of
B matrix.
With the extracted features for the captured
signals, the 200 samples were taken to train a support
vector machine per channel of Emotiv®. For training was
identified the imagined movement to left with 1 and the
imagined movement to right with -1.
Each support vector machine seeks define a
hyperplane that separate the 2 labeled classes (1,-1), due to
the captured data are not lineal , the trick of kernel was
used to classify them, the representation of a support
vector machine is given by equation 9 [17].

3. RESULTS
The Emotiv® sensor has 14 sensors (AF3, AF4,
F7, F8, F3, F4, FC5, FC6, T7, T8, P7, P8, O1 y O2)
distributed according to the international standard 10-20,
each channel has a sample frequency of 128 Hz. Due to
this frequency a IIR passband filter was used , to filter
between 8Hz and 30Hz as is shown in Figure-5.

Where Φ
is the dimensional space of the data,
that with the Kernel Gaussian function represented
by𝐾( , ) = exp⁡ −𝛾|| − ⁡ || ,
seeks
separate
spatially the two classes of data (imagined movement to
left or right). This separation allows to project a class
spatially to up while the other class is projected spatially
to down, on this way is possible graphic a hyperplane that
separate the two classes, as is shown in Figure-4.

Figure-5. Response of fast fourier transform to the signal
(a) and response of bandpass filter IIR (b).
With the filtered signals in the desired frequency
range was made the feature extraction using the ICA. This
analysis used the 200 samples taken previously and was
designed to extract 6 features for both imagined
movements, as is shown in Figure-6.

Figure-4. Hyperplane of the Kernel Gaussian function.
If a vector is perpendicular to the hyperplane may
have a formulation as⃗⃗ = ⁡ ∑𝑁= 𝛼 𝛾 Φ , then is
possible represent the SVM as is shown in equation 6 [18].

With the trained SVM were taken 30 additional
samples per imagined movement, this new samples may
be uses to prove the accuracy of the machines both the
features obtained with CSP as the features obtained with
ICA . On this way make a comparison between the two
analyses, in order to determine which has better results
during the classification process with the SVM.

left, but both sets of features have a defined pattern
excepting the error samples located in the peaks and dips
of the features.
On the other hand, the CSP analysis used just 26
samples from the 200 samples taken previously to obtain
as a result, 7 features that describe efficiently the behavior
of the imagined movement to left and other 7 features that
describe the imagined movement to right, as is shown in
Figure-7.

Figure-7. Features of imagined movement to right
(a) and features of imagined movement to left
(b) obtained with CSP.
In this case, the behavior of the motion
imagination to right has a stable magnitude while the
motion imagination to left tends to reduce its magnitude
until almost zero. Besides, is possible evidence a pattern
for both imagined movements according with their peaks
and dips?
Once identified the patterns of each analysis, 14
support vector machines were trained for both ICA as
CSP. These machines were proved with 60 new samples
for both imagined movement to right as the imagined
movement to left.

4. CONCLUSIONS
The ICA analysis allowed to use large volume of
samples ensuring a successful feature extraction for all
taken data, but due to the complexity of the analysis was
not possible have repeatability in the results. This mean
that the ICA required many trainings to define a set of
features appropriate for an accurate classification the brain
signals.
On the other hand, the CSP analysis presented
some problems when was used a large volume of samples
that implied reduce the number of sample in a 77 %.
Despite of this reduction, the CSP had repeatability due to
his process is clearly mathematic, this mean that to get the
best set of features to classify the brain signals is
necessary changing the number of samples used.
In the classification of the signals of motion
imagination through support vector machines, those
machines trained with the features from ICA analysis had
a recognition of 75% of the samples, where were
recognized 83,3% of samples of imagined movement to
right and 66,6% of samples of imagined movement to left.
Moreover, the machines trained with the features
from CSP analysis reached a recognition of 66,6 % of the
samples ,where were recognized 70% of samples of
imagined movement to right and 63,3% of samples of
imagined movement to left.
Comparing these analyses concluded that the
features from ICA analysis can handle bigger volume of
data and reach 10% more accuracy than the features from
CSP analysis. Otherwise, the CSP can reach excellent
results with low volume of data and no require retraining
as the ICA analysis, that each time the features are
extracted these are different.
