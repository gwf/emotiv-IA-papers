Abstract: In Phase I, we collected data on five subjects yielding over 90% positive performance
in Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) mid-and post-movement activity. In addition, a driver was
developed that substituted the actions of the Brain Computer Interface (BCI) as mouse button
presses for real-time use in visual simulations. The process was interfaced to a flight visualization
demonstration utilizing left or right brainwave thought movement, the user experiences, the aircraft
turning in the chosen direction, or on iOS Mobile Warfighter Videogame application. The BCI’s data
analytics of a subject’s MEG brain waves and flight visualization performance videogame analytics
were stored and analyzed using the Hadoop Ecosystem as a quick retrieval data warehouse. In Phase
II portion of the project involves the Emotiv Encephalographic (EEG) Wireless Brain–Computer
interfaces (BCIs) allow for people to establish a novel communication channel between the human
brain and a machine, in this case, an iOS Mobile Application(s). The EEG BCI utilizes advanced and
novel machine learning algorithms, as well as the Spark Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), Cassandra
NoSQL database environment, and also the competitor NoSQL MongoDB database for housing BCI
analytics of subject’s response and users’ intent illustrated for both MEG/EEG brainwave signal
acquisition. The wireless EEG signals that were acquired from the OpenVibe and the Emotiv EPOC
headset can be connected via Bluetooth to an iPhone utilizing a thin Client architecture. The use of
NoSQL databases were chosen because of its schema-less architecture and Map Reduce computational
paradigm algorithm for housing a user’s brain signals from each referencing sensor. Thus, in the
near future, if multiple users are playing on an online network connection and an MEG/EEG
sensor fails, or if the connection is lost from the smartphone and the webserver due to low battery
power or failed data transmission, it will not nullify the NoSQL document-oriented (MongoDB)
or column-oriented Cassandra databases. Additionally, NoSQL databases have fast querying and
indexing methodologies, which are perfect for online game analytics and technology. In Phase II,
we collected data on five MEG subjects, yielding over 90% positive performance on iOS Mobile
Applications with Objective-C and C++, however on EEG signals utilized on three subjects with
the Emotiv wireless headsets and (n < 10) subjects from the OpenVibe EEG database the Variational
Bayesian Factor Analysis Algorithm (VBFA) yielded below 60% performance and we are currently
pursuing extending the VBFA algorithm to work in the time-frequency domain referred to as VBFA-TF
to enhance EEG performance in the near future. The novel usage of NoSQL databases, Cassandra and
MongoDB, were the primary main enhancements of the BCI Phase II MEG/EEG brain signal data

Thus, the acquisitioned tomographic magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography
(MEG/EEG) subject brainwave signals can be uploaded locally on a single node or into a new and
innovative cloud based hosting infrastructure referenced as a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) utilizing
MongoDB and/or Cassandra as the NoSQL databases.
The previous tomographic MEG/EEG subject brainwave data analysis locally stored acquisitioned
brainwave signals into directories in a UNIX based file system or utilizing a relational database
system, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL. However, this proved unfruitful for real-time data acquisition
for subject’s brain signals and was focused on a RAID (Redundant Array of Disks) architecture. The
main fallbacks and hazards with utilizing a Relational Database Management System for acquired
subject’s brain signals in real-time is if a MEG/EEG electrode array or sensor fails to acquisition signal
data from the subject it will result in nulls in the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).

The concept of extracting brainwaves and classification of user intent is referred to as
brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), sometimes called mind-machine interfacing (MMI) or brain-machine
interfacing (BMI), has been evolving for many years. These interfaces are used for both noninvasive
procedures (such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG)), as well
as for invasive procedures (such as electrocorticographic (ECoG) events). What follows is a brief
discussion of the history and importance of BCIs in the noninvasive procedures of MEG and EEG as
they relate to recent applications, ranging from interactive video game technology to robotics and
mobile applications.

As a result of the innovation of the next generation MEG and EEG BCI applications, this
technology is potentially applicable to other types of cloud based architectures utilizing Big Data
analytics to reduce computational time and expense. The general consensus is that such methods
could yield the same result with less time lag and more compact BMI devices [2].

3.1. EEG Data Acquisition and Signal Processing
The aim of the wireless BCI research assumes that it is possible to assess thought movements
of individuals that are induced by specific events in the virtual environment while using EEG and
videogame analysis. In it is stated mental thoughts which are characteristics of user intent can be
classified using machine learning algorithms, while the subject’s brain waves are being acquired
via wireless EEG, and are essential in this research for measuring multiple states from left-right
thought movement. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the recording of electrical brain activity, which is
caused by the firing of neurons within the brain. The EEG brain signals and machine learning/signal
processing feature extraction are used to classify the EEG signal will be used as a control signal for
the warfighter simulator or NAZZY Frozen Video game. The classification of EEG brainwave data
illustrating multiple states of left-right thought movement are detected and analyzed with novel
machine learning algorithms. The output of the subject’s analytics while playing the flight simulator
videogame or NAZZY Frozen Videogame post signal classification is recorded and warehoused in a
NoSQL Cassandra and MongoDB database environment.
The dilemma with wireless EEG is that the sensors typically may have a very poor signal-to-noise
ratio (e.g., lower monetary EEG sensor array cost may yield poor conductivity) and the utilization
of proprietary software (e.g., Emotiv Back-Propagation Neural Networks) are often necessary to
pre-process the wireless EEG brain-wave signals before the VBFA machine learning classifier can be
applied, see in Figure 13 [15]. The lack of conductivity from EEG sensor array as opposed to MEG
sensor arrays are based on a higher remuneration cost for design for brain signal acquisition. In the
human brain, the current is generated mostly by pumping the positive ions of sodium, potassium,
calcium, and the negative ion of chlorine, through the neuron membranes in the direction that is
governed by the membrane potential [16]. Thus, an EEG signal is a measurement of currents during
synaptic excitations of neurons in the cerebral cortex. The human head pertains to three different layers
inclusive of the skull, scalp, and brain, and myriads of subsequent thin layers. The lack of conductivity
from EEG sensors to acquisition brain signals is due to the skull attenuating the signals approximately
one hundred times more than soft tissue [10,16].
EEG is the quintessential tool to study and diagnosis myriads of neurological disorders and other
brain related abnormalities. The utilization of EEG Brain Computer Interface technology has myriads
of applications to the following [1,17]:
