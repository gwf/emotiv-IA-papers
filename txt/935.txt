Abstract:
Aim /Objective:
A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a communication medium, which restructures brain signals into respective commands for an external device.
Methodology:
A BCI allows its target users like persons with motor disabilities to act on their environment using brain signals without using peripheral nerves or
muscles. In this review article, we have presented a view on different BCIs for humans with motor disabilities.
Results & Conclusion:
From the study, it is clear that the P300 based Electroencephalography (EEG)BCIs with Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) nonparametric feature extraction techniques work with high efficiency in the major parameters like Information Bit Transfer Rate (ITR), Mutual
Information (MI) rate and Low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and achieve a maximum classification accuracy using Self Organized Fuzzy Neural
Network (SOFNN).

I. INTRODUCTION
The human brain has a huge network of nervous
cells/neurons. The neurons fire inside the brain and produce an
electrical signal. These neurons transmit information from the
brain to discretionary muscles to control the motor organs [1].
When the neurons are not able to transmit signals among the
brain and nervous system, these disorders lead to coma and
paralysis. Such kind of individuals needs Brain-Computer
Interface (BCI) for communication [2]. BCI systems enable a
person with motor disabilities to send commands to a device by
means of brain signals [3,4]. In order to control a BCI, the user
must have to produce brain activity patterns that can be
transmitted to the system and translated into commands [5].

The BCI system (Fig. 1) has subsequent components: (i) a
tool to record brain functionaries either invasive Electrocorticography (ECoG) [6] or non–invasive Electroencephalography (EEG) [7]; (ii) a preprocessor that minimizes
the artifacts and noises [8]; (iii) a decoder which decodes the
preprocessed signal into an impact signal [9] for (iv) an
adscititious tool that might be a suitable application for the BCI
(e.g., an automatic mechanism, a display monitor etc.) [10]
[11]. The opinion of the user was a vital feature of the BCI
model because it gives the previous input concerning errors.
With this, it encourages the user to regulate the activity of the
brain to extend consideration and involvement within the work
or a task, therefore, observing to a neurofeedback principle, the
BCI is often considered as an impactful model with the active
response (closed-loop system) [12 - 15]. A BCI could be a
communication system that is not based on the brain’s
conventional fasciculus output channels. The user’s objective is
delivered through brain signals (EEG) instead of by peripheral

muscles and nerves, and these signals of the brain do not rely
on his or her production on fasciculus actions. The BCI
provides a period of communication to the user and also to the
external world. The user gets a reflective response as the result
of the BCI tasks, which response will have an effect on the
user’s resultant objective and its expression in signals from the
brain.

2.2. Partially Invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces
Partially invasive BCI systems are deep-routed inside the
skull, and rest is fixed externally from the brain, rather than
inside the grey substance. Signal quality exploitation, this sort
of BCI is somewhat vulnerable once it correlates to Invasive
BCI. They generate high-quality signals than non-invasive
BCIs. Partly invasive BCIs have the minimum threat of
connective tissue development when placed beside Invasive
BCI.
2.3. Non-Invasive BCI

2. BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE TYPES
There are many forms of BCI determining the essential
reason for those tools to block the electrical signals which pass
among neurons within the brain and convert it to a signal
which is detected by external tools.
2.1. Invasive BCI
Invasive BCI tools are those deep-routed directly into the
brain to acquire signals without artifacts. Invasive BCIs do not
work with ECoG signals, hence they utilize direct brain signals
to operate leg, limbs, and arms. As they rest inside the grey
substance, invasive tools make the best signals of BCI devices;
in any case, they are at the risk of scaring brain -tissues,
perpetrating the signal to turn out vulnerable or maybe lost that
the body responds to an external object within the brain.

The non-invasive method is one within which the clinical
scanning sensors or devices that are fixed on caps or headbands
to scan the brain signals. Here, electrodes cannot be fixed
straightforwardly on the predefined region of the brain but on
the scalp. One of the very popular devices beneath this class is
that the EEG equipped device to present fine temporal resolutions. It is easy to utilize, minimal cost and transportable.
Non-invasive BCI has the lesser signal clarity once it includes
human action with the brain (skull distortion signal) which is
most secure of all sort. This type of device has been utilized to
make progress in enabling a patient to move muscle implants
and reestablish partial movement.
ECoG is a non-invasive technique. Here, the electrodes are
implanted in a thin plastic pad which is fixed on the cortex, at a
minimum place with respect to the meninx. ECoG based
robotic BCI devices utilize one-dimensional control utilization. Light-weight Reactive Imaging BCI devices are still
inside the realm of theory. These would include embedding
optical tool inside the bone. The optical tool would be trained
on a single nerve cell. In this manner, each neuron's coefficient
will be estimated by a single detector. When nerve cell fires,
the optical tool’s light-weight pattern and its wavelength
reflection would modify marginally so as to reduce the chance
of scar tissue development through non-invasive ECoG.

BCIs specializing in motor neuroprosthetics mean to either
reestablishing development in paralytic individuals or to
provide devices for supporting them, like interacting with
computers or robotic arms. This experiment utilizes a lot of
refined embedded based active mapping of phosphenes as
appeared in Fig. (2).

2.4. The Emotiv Education Edition SDK
The EEG headset receiver, to extricate an individual's brain
waves to diagnose them, is an EPOC headset receiver. Insights
of an EPOC headset receiver are defined below. The Education
Edition SDK by Emotiv Systems has a headset: a fourteen

names upheld the International 10-20 regions are: AF3, F3, F7,
FC5, P7, T7, P8, O1, O2, T8, F4, FC6, F8, &AF4 [16].

reduction. When the input file to an algorithmic program is
simply too large to process and it is assumed to be excess, at
that point, it will be renovated into a reduced set of choices.
This technique is named feature selection. The selected option
squares the measure of predicting important data from the input
file, so the predefined task will be performed by mishandling
this reduced outline instead of the entire initial data.
The extraction of the feature includes lessening the number
of resources required to clarify a large set of data. When performing analysis of different data, one among the first issues
originates from the number of factors considered. Analyzing
with a larger usual range of factors needs a large amount of
memory and computation power; collectively, it should cause a
classification algorithmic program to overfit to instruct the
samples and sum up ineffectively. The extraction of features
could be a common term for developing combinations of
variables, to initiate the input with adequate accuracy. From the
study [21 - 29], several high-performance feature extraction
techniques have been reported, as listed in the summary. The
majority of the techniques listed from the study [21 - 29] are
reported with non-parametric types of feature extraction
techniques, the study [29] alone used parametric AR method
for feature extraction.
4. CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS OF BCIS

The Education Edition SDK moreover comprises a restrictive package toolbox that uncovers the Apis and identification libraries. The SDK gives a better improvement setting
that combines well with new and existing systems. Various
methods for obtaining brain signals epitomize EEG and
Magnetoencephalography (MEG). These methods are being
considered of MRI and Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) to
provide an analysis of brain wave and chemical patterns; in any
case, they are impractically inferable due to their size [17].
2.5. P300 EEG Based BCI
The P300 is an Event Relatedpotential, a quantifiable
electrical charge that is linearly associated with impulse. A
P300 BCI will linearly make an interpretation of an individual's
intention into electrical signals which control artificial devices
[18,19]. A P300 speller is predicated on this standard, the
identification of P300 waves allows the user to enter characters. The P300 speller comprises of two various classification
issues. The main classification is to locate the existence of a
P300 inside the graphical record (EEG). The second relates to
the combination of various P300 reactions for a significant
possible character to spell [20].
3. FEATURE EXTRACTION
In a BCI framework, the extraction of the feature begins
from an underlying set of estimated data and develops
determined qualities (features) intended to be instructive and
non-repetitive, facilitating the next learning and speculation
steps. The extraction of features is said to be spatiality

The classification step followed throughout the BCI system
is to acknowledge the subject’s activity with the support of a
feature vector and to classify it. Either regression or
classification algorithms are utilized [30]. The classification
algorithms use alternatives of extricated variables for stipulating boundaries among the feature sets [31]. As represented
the difference among any two modifications, for a two-target
case, each of a regression method or a classification method is
desired to have the parameter of 1 that may be operated
throughout the distributed area directly. In distinction, the
classification method works with the perseverance of 3
functions, one for every 3 boundaries among the 4 targets.
Therefore, the classification method may collectively be
helpful for two-target applications and additionally, the
regression method is utilized for larger targets, once these
targets are organized on one or many dimensions. Additionally,
the regression method was efficient for constant feedback i.e.
application that comprises constant control of movements [32].
In comparison, an on-line session gives away BCI framework
analysis throughout real-time conditions. This means, offline
simulation and cross-validation are effective ways to develop
and correlate new algorithms.However, separate on-line analysis will result in better BCI performance [33 - 46]. The
classification algorithm has been labeled by users through
supervised learning in the feature extracted dataset.
5. DISCUSSION
The majority of the individuals with disabilities will have
to manage their activities using brain signals, the EEG signals
were mostly an applicable choice of input signals for the BCI
system. EEG signals were acquired from channels associated
with persons with motor disabilities. The corresponding commands were derived from EEG signals, which support the brain
signal pattern. If the amplitude recorded from the brain signals

130 The Open Biomedical Engineering Journal, 2019, Volume 13

throughout the trials was larger than the limit, then the system
identifies a command for processing. For e.g. “turn right” and
“turn left” command is detected, whereas positive or a negative
potential recorded from the brain signal seems larger than the
connected threshold. If each value were matched with the
threshold value, there will be “no action”, brain signal order
was identified. The common benchmarked electrode placements are C21, C23, A1, A3, A19, A20, and A21, which are
mostly used in BCI experimentations. As far as the
conventional P300 were concerned, they deal with EventRelated Potential (ERP) related stimulus, such type of stimulus
produces comparatively less accuracy than the SSVEP based
visual stimulus techniques. The SSVEP is an oscillatory signal
that evokes in the occipital lobe of the EEG in reaction to a
visual stimulus, which was modified at a certain frequency. In
SSVEP based BCIs, the visual stimulus was modulated at
various frequencies. Once a BCI user aims attention on a
bound pattern, the related stimulating frequency predominantly
generates in the spectral illustration of the EEG signal obtained
at occipital sites, such action connected to the dominant
frequency were executed [47,48]. BCI study [27] presents a
high-speed speller BCI with a rate of conveying 40 characters
that have been presented for 13 subjects involving in visual
stimulus, hence this study proves that SSVEP has been a
promising analysis. In feature extraction methods, SSVEP
based non-parametric extraction technique has given more
information like time-domain features and spatiotemporal
features, which were most predominant than the ERP based
Parametric feature Extraction Technique. Many neural network
classifiers like SVM, PNN were presented in several BCI
studies but the classification accuracy seems comparatively
lesser than the hybrid variety of neural network classifiers (e.g.,
(SOFNN)). In SSVEP based visual stimulus,SOFNN Classifiers are more predominant in processing the raw EEG signals
such that it spontaneously evokes Mu and Beta frequencies for
Right and left-hand motor imagery movements and achieves
classification accuracy with high ITRs and low SNR [49 - 60].
Several analyses had the accuracy of BCIs and produced
suitable data bit rate, though the inherent major challenges in
the brain signal process. However, the recent vital
improvements, issues, and problems are yet to be resolved.
Such tasks were performed using invasive, non-invasive and
partially invasive BCIs for the persons with motor disabilities.
Majority of the researchers ignored partially invasive and

Anitha et al.

invasive methodology due to its practical difficulties. In
common, speller based BCIs with the combination of Brain
signal to audio and brain signal to text with SSVEP parametric
feature extraction seems to be much efficient than the
conventional type of BCIs. For resolving the practical
drawbacks, a new concept of P300 with Global System for
Mobile Communications (GSM) based BCIs with SSVEP
based Statistical feature extraction technique for EEG
operations with an additional operation of transmitting the
brain signals to text as well as audio during emergency will
perform more efficiently than the above existing conventional
type of BCIs for reducing the practical difficulties of a person
with motor disabilities.
CONCLUSION
This work has analyzed the progression of BCI systems,
discussing essential parts of different BCI models and the most
significant objectives that have driven BCI analysis in the past
twenty years. It has been noticed that a lot of progress has been
made in the analysis of BCI. Various neuroimaging
methodologies are included in this progress which are to be
implemented in BCI; (I) EEG, that presents satisfactory quality
signals with high versatility and is beyond the regular
methodologies; (ii) fMRI works with large integer scale, that
squares the measure of attempted viable methods for confining
active zones inside the brain; and (iii) Invasive methods, that
are significant techniques to deliver high quality signal that are
required in some dimensional control applications e.g.
neuroprostheses management. BCI studies have considered
time, frequency, and spatial components of brain signals
individually. These signal dimension interdependencies are the
latest developments in BCI. BCI analysis suggests that creative
improvements are awaiting in the near future. These
accomplishments and furthermore the potential for brand new
BCI applications have clearly given a valuable improvement to
BCI analysis including multidisciplinary researchers e.g.
neuroscientists, mathematicians, engineers, and medical rehabilitation experts, among others. Interest within the BCI
domain is predicted to expand based on the possibilities. In the
future, the BCI system may become another model of humanmachine combination with various levels in the day to day life
of individuals with motor disabilities.
