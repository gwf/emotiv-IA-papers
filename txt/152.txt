ABSTRACT

Article history:

Brain-computer interface is a technology that allows operating a device
without involving muscles and sound, but directly from the brain through
the processed electrical signals. The technology works by capturing electrical
or magnetic signals from the brain, which are then processed to obtain
information contained therein. Usually, BCI uses information from
electroencephalogram (EEG) signals based on various variables reviewed.
This study proposed BCI to move external devices such as a drone simulator
based on EEG signal information. From the EEG signal was extracted to get
motor imagery (MI) and focus variable using wavelet. Then, they were
classified by recurrent neural networks (RNN). In overcoming the problem of
vanishing memory from RNN, was used long short-term memory (LSTM).
The results showed that BCI used wavelet, and RNN can drive external devices
of non-training data with an accuracy of 79.6%. The experiment gave
AdaDelta model is better than the Adam model in terms of accuracy and value
losses. Whereas in computational learning time, Adam's model is faster than
AdaDelta's model.

INTRODUCTION
Humans in every day always carry out activities that involve the movement of limbs. The brain
instructs the resulting action through motor nerves. Every human activity requires a focus on carrying out
activities for particular purposes. Nevertheless, the focus can be influenced by several factors such as
stimulation of sound or vision that can affect the activities being carried out. In meanwhile, the command to
move a limb occurs over a state of mind called motor imagery (MI). However, moving the object can be carried
out without involve gestures, muscles, sounds, and other motor functions. These commands are obtained from
the brain through intermediate devices to translate brain commands, known as the brain-computer interface
(BCI). This system can help people with physical disabilities in moving external devices. Currently, BCI has
been widely used to drive games [1, 2], robots [3], to help post-stroke patients [4] and neuromuscular
disabilities [5].
BCI consists of three parts, particularly command input, intermediate device, and command control.
BCI usually uses standard tools such as electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to translate brain commands [6].
The EEG signal is bioelectric in the brain that is captured on the surface of the scalp. EEG signal has a low
amplitude, non-stationary, and complicated patterns. The signal consists of frequency components such as

Alpha waves (8-13 Hz), Beta waves (14-30 Hz), Theta waves (4-7 Hz), Delta waves (0.5-3 Hz), and Gamma
waves (> 30 Hz). EEG signal identified mental task variables as appropriate actions on a computer [7].
Therefore, the representation of EEG signals into the frequency domain is very considerate for
getting conditions particular thoughts. Some previous studies in extracting EEG signals using wavelet
transform [8-11] in BCI. Wavelets can filter signals from precise frequency components. So that method is
proper for non-stationary signals such as EEG. However, with a short time segmentation, it is possible to use
other methods such as fast Fourier transform (FFT) for extracting non-stationary signals [12]. FFT has
advantages in terms of computational speed, although wavelet is usually more accurate. Wavelet extraction
can increase accuracy by 3.6% and accelerate detection time by 0.003 seconds. The last study obtained 93.6%
accuracy of training data, and 90% of non-training data [13].
Some variables that affected EEG signals are determinants of classification in previous studies,
such as emotions [14], disorder [15] and focus [16]. Meanwhile, usually, the EEG signal variable translated
in BCI is focus [16], attention level [17], relax [1], emotion [18, 19], hand grasping imagination [20] and hybrid
of motor imagery and speech imagery [21]. Usually, the studies used one characteristic variable in
the classification process. Previous studies used BCI to move characters in arcade games based on focus
feedback [22], controls for computer applications, or action on imagined conditions of the mind [6] and
wheelchair robotic [23].
In pattern recognition, after extraction features, then into the classification system. In BCI application,
the previous research used some methods such as learning vector quantization (LVQ) [1], recurrent neural
networks (RNN) [24], and convolutional neural networks (CNN) [25]. There was using CNN to BCI game
control [26]. Meanwhile, time series cases often use RNN, which facilitates the connection of sequential data
with past time [19]. In previous studies using RNN to recognize emotions from EEG signals with an accuracy
rate of 87% [14]. This research proposed the BCI model to drive the drone simulator from the focus state and
motor imagery. Models developed using wavelet and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The drone simulator
is designed to be driven by an imagery motor into four, particularly "forward", "right", "left", and "silent".
Besides, the simulator action added focus factor (two classes: focus or not focus), which is described as
the rotation speed. So that eight classes are obtained.

2.2. Wavelet extraction
The wavelet transform can extract the needed signal components, hence reducing the number of data
without losing important information. Besides, this method is suitable for non-stationary signals. The output
of the wavelet transform into a time-domain allows its application as a pre-model [6]. Wavelet transformation
has two main processes, specifically decomposition, that extract a signal into a specific frequency and
reconstruction that recombine extracted signals into their original form [27]. Wavelet works in a convolution
signal with mother wavelet. Various forms of wavelets used for EEG signal extraction from previous studies,
such as Daubechies Haar and Symmlet. The researchers did not specifically mention the basic shape of
the wavelet that gives good accuracy. But in general, the asymmetric Daubechies [7], combine of Daubechies
and Symlet [28] and Symmlet [29]. Both forms are compatible with EEG signal characteristics. One type of
wavelet transform is wavelet packet decomposition (WPD). Wavelet packets are linear combinations of
wavelet functions [9]. A wavelet function has three indices, j: index scale (integer), k: translation coefficient,
n: oscillation parameter and t is time as (1).
𝑛
𝑊𝑗,𝑘
= 2𝑗/2 𝑊 𝑛 (2𝑗 𝑡 − 𝑘)

(1)

The wavelet packet functions are a scaling function  (t ) and the mother wavelet function  (t ) .
Wavelet packet functions with higher filter are:
2𝑛
2𝑛
(2𝑡 − 𝑘)
𝑊0,0
= √2 ∑𝑘 ℎ(𝑘)𝑊1,𝑘

(2)

2𝑛
2𝑛+1
(2𝑡 − 𝑘)
𝑊0,0
= √2 ∑𝑘 𝑔(𝑘)𝑊1,𝑘

(3)

The factor h(k) and g(k) indicate quadrature mirror extraction [30]. The value (h(k) and g(k) related
to the scaling function and the mother wavelet function. The inner product signal f(t) with wavelet packet
functions in a range of t show (4):
𝑛
𝑛
𝑛
(2𝑡 − 𝑘)
𝑊𝑗,𝑘
= 𝑓(𝑡)*𝑊𝑗,𝑘
= ∑𝑡 𝑓(𝑡)𝑊𝑗,𝑘

(4)

For original signal S, the left-side is obtained in low pass filter h(k) as an approximation coefficient
and the right side as high pass filter g(k) or detail. In (6) showed the scale, translation, and oscillation values.
In (4), the signal can be decomposed into a scale factor j in a particular frequency, either high or low. In this
study, using the standard form Daubechies 4, which consists of four low-pass filter coefficients [29]. Wavelets
decompose signals into specific frequency ranges, such as delta, alpha, beta, theta, and gamma waves, such as
Figure 3.
2.3. Recurrent neural networks
RNN is one method used in Deep Learning for sequential data [31], by looping to store information
from the past [32]. This configuration is shown in Figure 4. RNN is activated with a function such as sigmoid
as Figure 5. RNN has the problems of short memory, so it needs control to forget some parts throughout
the gate. Some of the methods are gated recurrent unit (GRU), backpropagation through time (BPTT), and long
short-term memory (LSTM). This research used the LSTM gate to overcome short-term memory problems or
often called vanishing gradient [14], which has a increase in capability from a single layer [33].

Figure 3. Wavelet multilevel

Figure 4. Recurrent neural network architecture

Figure 5. LSTM cell architecture

The LSTM network consists of modules with repetitive processing, as in Figure 4. Memory in LSTM
is called cells that take input from the previous state (ht-1) and current input (xt). The collection of cells decides
what will be stored in memory and what will be removed from memory. LSTM combines the previous state,
current memory, and input. LSTM has three gates, particularly the forget gate, to determine which eliminating
information from the cell using the sigmoid layer [34]. In (5) with the activation function used is the release
shown in (8).
𝑓𝑡 = 𝜎(𝑊𝑓 . [ℎ𝑡−1 , 𝑥𝑡 ] + 𝑏𝑓 )

(5)

𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑈(𝑥) = max(0, 𝑥)

(6)

The second gate is the input gate (i), which of the sigmoid layer (σ) will be updated, and tanh of
the layer will be formulated as a vector of the updated value. It can be seen at (7) and (8) where x t is input for
each current step time. At this layer, a vector of updated values will be produced [35].
𝑖𝑡 = 𝜎(𝑊𝑓 . [ℎ𝑡−1 , 𝑥𝑡 ] + 𝑏𝑖 )

(7)

𝐶̃𝑡 = tanh(𝑊𝑐 . [ℎ𝑡−1 , 𝑥𝑡 ] + 𝑏𝑐 )

(8)

Then the cells of (7), (8) will be updated using (9).
𝐶𝑡 = 𝑓𝑡 ∗ 𝐶𝑡−1 + 𝑖𝑡 ∗ 𝐶̃𝑡

Finally, the output gate will be calculated based on cell updates, and the sigmoid layer looks like (10) and (11).
𝑜𝑡 = 𝜎(𝑊𝑜 . [ℎ𝑡−1 , 𝑥𝑡 ] + 𝑏𝑜 )

(10)

ℎ𝑡 = 𝑜𝑡 ∗ tanh(𝐶𝑡 )

(11)

where 𝜎 is the sigmoid activation function, and tanh as the tanh activation function used for the results of
multiplying the weight of each gate, namely Wf, Wt, Wc, Wo with input values and added bias including bf, bi,
bc, bo. Gate used is gate input it , forget ft, , and output ot . Each passing gate will be searched for hidden state
candidates 𝐶̃𝑡 obtained from the gate calculation with the current hidden state 𝐶𝑡 furthermore, the previously
hidden state Ct-1 to produce the latest hidden state, which is used as the output of the hidden layer.
In the identification layer, there is an effort to minimize the difference between the target output and
the output of computational results. Objective functions are often referred to as cost functions or loss functions
so-called "loss". One of the loss functions that can be used is cross-entropy, as in (12). Where loss is a distance,
S is the result of the activation function, and L is the target of each class label. A loss function is used to
measure convergence in the learning process.
Loss (S , L ) = −  Li log (Si )

In machine learning such RNN, it is essential to set input features. This research used MI and focus
variable, so alpha, mu, beta, and gamma (32-40Hz) waves relate that. Based on Figure 3, we got the waves of
four channels, as shown in Table 1. The BCI works every two seconds. While the RNN configuration is as
shown in Table 2. In the first model, the number of neurons of the model is faced with the same amount as
the input vector with a two-dimensional shape that applies the return sequence to the second LSTM model.
The LSTM model has a one-dimensional vector, which results in the dense layer, which has eight neurons,
according to the number of classes produced.

RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
The experiment was carried out by comparing the effect of using wavelet as the extraction of alpha,
mu, beta, and gamma waves. Experiments were also carried out on the model in terms of providing the highest
accuracy and considering the computational time of learning. Identification involves eight classes, namely
"Forward", "Right", "Left", and "Silent" each in focus and not. In using BCI, performance depends on
translating variables from the EEG signal being reviewed. Identification performance is very dependent on
the use of extraction methods. Therefore, testing begins with wavelet performance.
3.1. Wavelet extraction
Wavelet extraction uses Daubechies 4 at 9-40Hz, which has been normalized as in Figure 6. Wavelet
extraction is shown in blue compared to the original signal using orange. The EEG signal after going through
wavelet extraction is more stable because it is adjusted to the waves which are in the frequency range. Then
eliminate unused waves and signal noise. The results of each channel are stored sequentially into input vectors.
3.2. Compared between optimization model
This study used three-weight correction models that are adaptive moment estimation (Adam), adaptive
learning estimation (AdaDelta), and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We experience optimizer models and
optimal learning parameters that higher accuracy and shortest time computing. Adam has a fast convergence
property, but it is only unstable due to very rapid error reduction. Besides the optimizer model, we compared
using wavelet and without wavelet, as in Figure 7 of Accuracy and Figure 8 of losses value. There are three

models. Adam and AdaDelta are convergent of 100 epoch learning, except for the SGD model. So that
100 epochs are optimal enough, except with SGD with 500 epoch addition. Each color in Figure 7 and
Figure 8 indicates the testing of training data with wavelet (blue), training data without wavelet (green),
non-training/validation data with wavelet (orange), and validation data without wavelet (red). From the three
models shown in Figure 7 that using wavelet can increase accuracy and reduce computing time. The exact
values of the three models are shown in Table 3. Likewise, the value of Losses from using wavelets for
the three models generally decreases. This result told that wavelet could improve accuracy by reducing
the non-stationary properties of EEG signals.

Figure 7. Accuracy of the optimizer model; (a) Adam, (b) AdaDelta (c) SGD
The accuracy of the three models is relatively the same, mainly between 76-80% for validation data
while 100% for training data. Even so, the highest AdaDelta model is 79.81%. The exciting thing is that
the Adam model quickly corrects weights, which causes accuracy to increase rapidly and losses to decrease
at the beginning of the iteration. However, conditions of small fluctuations continue at the end of the epoch.
While the AdaDelta model tends to be stable at the end of the epoch, it achieves longer than the Adam model.
But it is understood that the weight correction method of the Adam model tends to jump like a ball that rolls
easily. Besides, the SGD model had almost no ripples of instability during the training. But the disadvantages
require longer iterations. Even in the 500th epoch, the accuracy is still increasing.

From various experiments, showed that RNN and wavelet could be used to support BCI using MI and
Focus variables with an accuracy of almost 80% non-training data. The future experiment needs to look out
the configuration of the input features and channel usage of the EEG signal. So that can improve accuracy.
This research gave the duration of computational learning using Adam, AdaDelta, and SGD optimization with
several configurations. A comparison of the length of time from the three optimizations can be seen in Table 4
with several configurations in 100 epochs.

CONCLUSION
This research showed that brain-computer interface could use motor imagery and focus variable of
EEG signal to move drone simulator. Nevertheless, the emphasis is real-time action with other computing time
applications that can be used. Proposed methods using RNN and wavelet could support BCI with MI and focus
variables with an accuracy of almost 80% non-training data. The research gave that the use of wavelet as
a pre-process can improve accuracy, lead to stability, and reduce the training data computation time. This result
is consistent with the hypothesis referring to previous research that wavelet is suitable for non-stationary signals

such as EEG signals. In using RNN, it is necessary to pay attention to the optimization model for the correction
of weights and the number of epochs used. Adam's model reaches asymptotically faster, but still fluctuates
at the end of the epoch, so it requires the right number of iterations. The SGD model is quieter in performance
but requires far more epochs. While the AdaDelta model adopts both models, it provides stable and high
accuracy. The next thing to look out for is the configuration of the input features and channel usage of
the EEG signal.
