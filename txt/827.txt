Gastronomic experiences offer a set of stimuli that affect the customer’s perception of
chef-designed food. This empirical study aims to analyze the influence on the consumer,
at a cerebral level, of the stimuli characteristic of a high-level gastronomic experience, in
a Michelin starred restaurant. The presentation by the waiter or chef, the plate design,
the dish served, the taste of food, interaction or moment in which the food is served are
the variables analyzed. Through the use of neuromarketing techniques – galvanic skin
response to register emotional arousal, eye tracking to identify where consumers look,
and electroencephalography to interpret emotional reactions – combined with qualitative
research technique (In-depth interviews with all consumers), in order to know the natural
and suggested memories, the objective of this research is to determine the emotional
impact of the variables analyzed against the actual taste of food, obtaining conclusions
about each variable in overall experience and allowing the authors to propose a model of
order design of dishes, designed by the chef, based on emotions and thereby achieving
greater efficiency in results of the experience and the memory of it. Results indicate a
favorable influence on emotions when the chef presents the food. Likewise, dishes with
special presentation have a greater influence at the level of interest than conventional
dishes. It is important to highlight that the levels of emotion and attention fall after the
midway point of the experience, due to the duration of the experience. Therefore, the
dishes do not have the same emotional impact, despite being as special as at the
beginning of the experience.

INTRODUCTION
One of the most traditional sectors of any economy is the restaurant sector (Díaz, 2015). It is a
cyclical sector that is in line with the economic situation of the country, so that it grows when
the country goes through a favorable economic moment (Ostelea, 2018). The World Tourism
Organization (UNWTO, 2017) dependent on the United Nations, indicates that, in the world
restaurant scenario, the countries in which the greatest investment is generated are the, China
and Japan, with 514,600, 485,600 and 234,500 million Euros, respectively. In the United States
alone, the restaurant industry turns over $ 899 billion, with more than 1 million restaurants spread
throughout the country (UNRA, 2020). The consumers that spend the most on restaurants are
the Japanese, those of the United States and Canadians, with more than € 1,100 per inhabitant,
unlike the Germans and the Chinese with an expenditure of € 412 and € 350 per inhabitant,
respectively (Díaz, 2015).

Neuromarketing – Haute Cuisine Gastronomic Experiences

In the world there are 136 restaurants with three Michelin
stars, spread across 17 countries (Cancela, 2019). Currently,
Spain is the fifth highest country in the world regarding
number of Michelin stars, with a total of 206 stars (11 new
stars compared to 2018), maintaining the fifth position, leading
Japan in the ranking.

Although the perspectives of the restaurant sector are
optimistic, this sector must face many challenges derived
from new consumer habits (Bertoch, 2018) which are being
influenced by factors such as technological changes, the need
to try new experiences or the increase in competition in the
sector (IFMA, 2017). Continuous innovation is the secret to
keeping the restaurant sector attractive, adapting to the trends
and needs of new generations of consumers. The current
consumer associates restaurants with experience, either because
they consider it as an alternative to household chores, or
because they can enjoy the moment intensely, sharing with
family or friends; or looking to be surprised with new flavors.
The challenge for the sector is to offer unique and memorable
experiences, making use of culinary creativity, the decoration of
the premises and tables, quality of service, special events and
technological level.
The culinary movement of haute cuisine, also known as
techno-emotional (or molecular) cuisine, has as its main objective
to excite the diner (Moreno, 2015). It consists of a gastronomic
modality in which you take more risks in the elaboration of
the dishes, playing, apart from the textures and temperatures
of the food, with the five senses. In this way, the diner
remains participatory during the meal, enjoying the fumes,
essences, colors and visual effects. It is a type of cuisine
that requires time for research, design and preparation and
that takes care of even the smallest detail. The establishments
must set themselves apart and sell a unique experience to
the client, resorting to experiential and sensory marketing.
This is the direction to follow to satisfy customer expectations
and build loyalty.
Haute cuisine is one of the most important tourist attractions
of large cities worldwide, and the most famous chefs and
restaurants in the United States, Europe, and Japan have spent
years working on their personal brands and making themselves
known in the Middle East, China and India. The Michelin guide
(Michelin, 2019) whose original mission was to contribute to
better mobility, has become a world reference in gastronomy,
publishing 28 Michelin Guides in 25 countries. From the year
1926, the valuation of the restaurants with stars began to be
incorporated into the guide and it was in 1936 when the valuation
criteria applied when awarding the stars were released.
Michelin has 85 inspectors around the world. All of them
are anonymous and salaried, professionals with an excellent
preparation (instructed in hospitality schools and with a
minimum professional experience of 5 years) and follow the same
criteria and methodology throughout the world. Subsequently,
the organization itself trains them, teaching the criteria for the
attribution of the stars, the comfort categories and how other
qualities and services are to be valued (they are accompanied
by another experienced inspector, for their first 6 months). All
inspectors must rigorously follow the same quality evaluation
criteria and follow the same standards on their visits. The main
rules are: independence, anonymous visit, choice of the best,
annual update and homogeneity of the selection. Annually, an
inspector has to travel more than 30,000 kilometers to visit
some 800 establishments, including 250 meals in restaurants and
around 150 nights in hotels.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The aim of this research is to determine through neuromarketing
techniques the cognitive perception of consumers, between
35 and 55 years old, with a medium-high socio-economic
level, who like to experience a gastronomic experience of
haute cuisine. The level of learning is linked to the influence
of the presentation, the food and the moment in which it
is served. The rest of the aspects (restaurant, atmosphere,
table and menu) remain constant. To do this, we have
used neuromarketing techniques that have allowed us to
analyze the attention of the subjects to the stimuli (eye
tracking), the emotional intensity experienced (Galvanic Skin
Response) and the interpretation of the sensations and emotions
experienced (electroencephalography).

Objectives
This research work helps answer the question of which aspects
are more relevant for consumers in haute cuisine gastronomic
experiences. The experience was carried out in a restaurant
with 2 Michelin stars called L’Escaleta, located in Alicante
(Spain), whose chef, Kiko Moya, seeks an identity of his own,
without falling into reconstruction, based on the flavors of
the region, aiming to contribute something new from the
traditional flavors.
The main objective of the research is to analyze the mixed
construct type “experience” of a consumer, in response to the
presentation (description) and tasting of food in a restaurant.
The specific objectives are as follows:
• Monitor, by synchronizing the galvanic response of the
skin, the gaze fixation (pupil trajectory) and the recording
of emotional levels (through electroencephalography) to
identify the emotional traces (somatic markers) based on
the levels of the bio-measurements recorded, for each phase
and for the overall experience.
• Measure the perception of value of the tasting experience
(based on the measurement of emotional or arousal
intensity, and the percentage value of the register
of emotions, expressed in terms of “engagement,”
“excitement,” “interest,” “focus,” “Stress,” and ”relaxation”).
• Register areas and elements of greatest interest to the
consumer and verify that they coincide with the elements
that add value to the product (design of the dish or
support and presence of the Chef) and are manifested based
on the increase in emotional arousal and the degree of
interest by the dish.
• Analyze whether the perception of value of the sensory
experience can be improved by modifying the order

Neuromarketing – Haute Cuisine Gastronomic Experiences

Neuromarketing originates from combining neuroscience and
marketing, with technological advances that allow us to analyze
what brain reactions trigger the stimuli of marketing and
communication in consumers (Reimann et al., 2011). The
purpose of marketing is to facilitate the meeting between
products and people (Ariely and Berns, 2010). Based on this,
neuromarketing promotes understanding of the connection of
the activity of the neural system with consumer behavior. The
theoretical, empirical and practical field of neuromarketing is
still developing, due to the fact that it is a young discipline
(Garcia and Saad, 2008). Butler (2008) suggests a neuromarketing
research model in which marketing professionals, researchers,
and other interested parties are interconnected, pointing out that
more research is needed to confirm its academic importance
(Álvarez del Blanco, 2011).
At present, the new trend of commercialization and marketing
must focus its efforts on understanding the behavior and needs
of customers and consumers, based on the knowledge of the
functioning of the brain that neurosciences applied to the
economy provide (Hsu, 2017; Molchanov et al., 2017). The
insufficiency of offering quality products or services coexists with
the decreasing power of traditional advertising communication,
a fragmentation of the media that causes the presence of new
channels, especially through the Internet, and the appearance
of the informed consumer (Schmitt et al., 2003). Satisfaction
currently only guarantees to a certain extent that consumers do
not file complaints, but in order to build customer loyalty over
the long term, customers, in addition to being satisfied, must be
delighted with the brand (Lindstrom, 2008).
It is about the emergence of the culture of experience
(Piqueras-Fiszman and Jaeger, 2016). Consumers expect
experiences in other environments, such as going to a restaurant
or shopping center (not only in traditional places where
entertainment is offered as a cinema or a theme park). In
this sense, experiences can become complex, personal and
provide a lot of information (Manzano, 2011). Sensory
marketing (Krishna, 2012) allows brand communication to
be managed toward the five senses, with the aim of affecting
the perception and purchasing behavior in relation to a product
or service (Manzano, 2011) filling the previous deficiencies
of a very rational marketing (Daucé and Rieunier, 2002).
Create unforgettable experiences, where “sensory pleasure”
permeates the client’s consciousness by appealing to the
senses (Krishna, 2011). Going beyond the traditional means
of sight and sound marketing, brands can establish a stronger
and more lasting emotional connection with consumers
(Medina, 2008). Multisensory marketing (Filser, 2003) allows
the attention of the public (Filser, 2003) to be increased,
empowering a rational and emotional client (Schmitt, 2006)
who reacts better to emotional and creative stimulation,
with stimuli that appeal to senses, feelings and reason itself,
with a connection to certain lifestyles with which clients feel
identified (Li and Wang, 2017). The techniques and tools
used depend on the product being researched (Schmitt, 2006).
Available techniques include eye movement analysis, brain focus
techniques and traditional verbal methods (surveys, focus group
or in-depth interviews).

of the dishes, based on the results of the registered
biomedical measurements.

Research Instrument
In this study, the research technique used is neuromarketing.
Its purpose is to measure the cognitive processing of the
stimuli designed in a haute cuisine gastronomic experience.
Neuromarketing combines neuroscience, psychology and
economics (Madan, 2010) analyzing the effectiveness of brand
stimuli (Baron et al., 2017) and the psychology of consumer
behavior (Plassmann et al., 2012) improving conventional
research methods, limited by participants’ perceptions or
behaviors (Ariely and Berns, 2010).
Eye tracking, galvanic skin response (GSR) and
electroencephalography (EEG) are the three specific
neuromarketing techniques used in this work. Eye tracking
has been used to record the visual attention of the subjects based
on their eye movements (Duchowski, 2007) identifying the
areas that are of interest to the subject (AOI). The GSR collects
electrodermal activity (EDA), reflecting changes in the state
of emotional arousal, influencing the cognitive perception of
stimuli (Critchley, 2002). The EEG provides valuable information
on brain activity, analyzing and recording changes in electrical
currents, in the form of brain waves (Yadava et al., 2017). When
subjects focus their attention on a stimulus, it is recorded by
the eye tracking system and cognitive and affective processing
(partially recorded by GSR and EEG) begins, resulting in an
influence on consumer preferences (Bornstein and D’agostino,
1992; Ramele et al., 2012; Sanei and Chambers, 2013).
Market research has not had the impact it should have
on business decision making (Martínez, 1991). The outputs
generated by the market research department should have a
direct impact on the economic results of companies (Báez and
De Tudela, 2007), however, between 75 and 85% of all new
product launches fail (Innerscope, 2018) often due to failing to
predict major changes and new trends. Neoclassical economics,
specifically the concept of the Homo Economicus (Smith, 1794)
and the Theory of Expected Subjective Profit (Savage, 1954)
has influenced the basis on which market research was based
until now. It has particularly influenced quantitative research and
prediction of future consumer trends (Nicosia, 1966; Engel et al.,
1968; Howard and Sheth, 1969).
The economic and rational approach of the human being
is left behind (Simon, 1959; Kahneman and Tversky, 1979)
revealing that the human being uses heuristics (mental shortcuts)
that are far from logical models (León and Botella, 2003).
Emotion analysis and cognitive psychology transform the study
of consumer behavior and market research (Thaler, 2000;
Kahneman, 2011).
It highlights the relevance of emotions in the decision-making
process (Zajonc, 1980). Emotion and reason can be understood
as two complementary mechanisms in the brain (Mackie and
Worth, 1989) when making decisions (Damasio, 1994).
Consumer neuroscience (Escera, 2004) can be defined as
the analysis of neural conditions and the processes involved
during consumption, as well as the consequences on behavior
and its psychological significance (Reimann et al., 2011).

Neuromarketing – Haute Cuisine Gastronomic Experiences

The statistical analysis of the data was performed with the
R software, v.3.6.3. Common elements (stimuli) were defined
for all diners (volunteers). The subjects were exposed to a total
of 18 dishes, structured into 11 snacks or starters, 4 main
courses and 3 desserts (Figure 1 and Table 1). Subjects could
not eat while the dishes were presented to them, proceeding to
the separation between stimuli – presentation and tasting – to
prioritize the areas of interest that captured the most attention
(Añaños-Carrasco, 2015).
The independent variables were the age and sex of the
participants, with a similar sociocultural profile and determined
by the main profile of the restaurant’s clients. The dependent
variables were the focus of attention, the peaks of emotional
excitement and the levels of brain activity recorded in response
to the observed stimuli.
In the first phase of the study, the dishes were served
according to the order established by the chef, collecting the
records of eye tracking (visual attention), electrodermal activity
(states of emotional excitement) and electroencephalography
(interpretation of brain activity based on waves), in order
to identify those dishes with the greatest impact on
diners (Figure 2).
In order to achieve this regulation of emotions and avoid
the saturation and fatigue of diners in a 2 and a half hour
experience, we proceeded to a second phase to order the
dishes on the menu, interspersing (agreed with the chef) dishes
of greater emotional intensity, with less emotionally charged
dishes, according to phase 1 records, looking for alternate peakvalley moments, beginning and ending with a peak moment,
with the intention of improving the memory of the experience
(Renvoisé and Morin, 2007).
Both the dishes and the people who presented them remained
constant during the experiment (phases 1 and 2).
Regarding the semi-structured in-depth interview, the
interview protocol was designed to provide evidence of the
tasting experience. The interviews were carried out by the
authors. All interviews were conducted face-to-face. All
interviews were videotaped, transcribed, and analyzed.

Neuromarketing studies applied to the food sector aim to
provide best practices in food marketing, as well as other aspects
such as the perception of nutritional elements (Thomas et al.,
2016) the health content of labels (Velasco et al., 2015) the
presence of additives and the evaluation of the information
transmitted by food packaging (Enax et al., 2015; Hahnel et al.,
2015; Fenko et al., 2018; Stasi et al., 2018). The use of eye
tracking in order to verify the efficacy of food styling (Tichy et al.,
2017) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to analyze
brain activity against brand logos and their food products, in
order to analyze their brain activation (Fehse et al., 2017) or
neuromarketing techniques to improve a quantitative study on
consumer preferences for organic products (Stoica et al., 2015)
are lines of work in research for the food sector. However,
everything that is extraordinary (good or bad) becomes ordinary
after a time (Smith, 2010). The human mind, in a more or less
long period of time, returns to its natural and accustomed state
of balance and tranquility (Smith, 2010) regulating the level of
emotions, seeking to ensure balance and stability. The brain seeks
homeostatic balance (Oatley, 1970) and just as body temperature,
blood oxygen, or sleep is regulated (VanItallie, 2006) it also tries
to balance the human organism on a psychological level (Wilson
et al., 2003) under the concept of emotional evanescence.
Taking this emotional regulation into account, it is important
to provide emotional changes that momentarily increase visual
retention (peak-valley-peak emotional moments) (Teixeira et al.,
2012) this being consistent with a high evaluation of the
experience, if it ends with a peak moment of emotion.

Sample
In the present research, the sample consisted of men and women,
according to the profile of the target indicated by the restaurant
for the current consumer. A total of 60 people (50% men and 50%
women) participated randomly and voluntarily as study subjects
after meeting the requirements of being between the ages of
35 and 55 and with a medium-high socioeconomic level. The
fieldwork was carried out between January 2018 and February
2019. The location of the study was in the L’Escaleta restaurant,
selecting “table zero” for its particular location which was isolated
from other diners, measuring subjects of various origins. The
study was structured in 2 phases, and in each phase the sample
size (consisting of 15 men and 15 women) was suitable for a
neuromarketing study (Cuesta-Cambra et al., 2017).

RESULTS

Data Collection and Analysis

Analysis of the Emotional Intensity of
Each Dish (Presentation and Tasting).
Phase 1

The research phase with the dishes from the tasting menu was
carried out using the Pupil Labs manufacturer’s “Pupil Core”
eye tracking model, with a sampling frequency of 200 Hz.
Pupil Capture software, v.1.23 was used for data collection. The
Shimmer3 GSR + model was used to record the electrodermal
activity, using the ConsensysPRO software, v.1.6, for data
collection. Finally, for recording changes in electrical currents
in the form of brain waves, the EEG EPOC + model from
the manufacturer Emotiv was used, with 14 channels and
saline-based electrodes. EmotivPRO v.2.0 software was used for
data collection.

In the following figure (Figure 3), the emotional level of the
presentation phase can be seen, followed by the data from the
tasting phase, for each dish:
The average GSR for this phase 1 is 0.47 (parts per unit).
The GSR values are referenced with respect to the average
gastronomic experience.
Some dishes, such as Hummus, Polen, Gamba or Mostaza
(dishes 4, 9, 10 and 11, respectively), show an average of GSR in
the presentation below the average, but during the tasting they
have risen considerably. The emotional intensity of the tasting
was greater than the presentation of the dish.

The dishes whose presentation has shown a higher level of
emotional intensity than the tasting have been: Turrón, Oreo,
Chicharrón, Queso, Musgo, Pan, Arroz, Asado and Brioche
(dishes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 14, 15 and 17, respectively).
Below (Figure 4) the global value – joint representation – of
the emotional intensity of each dish is shown:
The GSR values are referenced with respect to the average
gastronomic experience. It should be noted that the dishes with
the best record of emotional intensity in Phase 1 have been (in

Oreo, Polen, Hummus, Turrón, Chicharrón, Pan, Gambón,
Musgo, Mostaza Brioche and Queso. Although, the dishes with
the lowest register of emotional intensity have been (in order
and below average value): Arroz, Mero, Chirivía, Asado, Erizos
and Supermousse.
The following graph (Figure 5) breaks down the level of
emotional intensity into three groups, corresponding to starters,
main courses and desserts. The average GSR data of the

fatigue on the emotional intensity of the subjects, separating the
representation of the level of emotional intensity of the dishes,
before and after the midway point of the experience. Figure 7
shows the average GSR data of the presentation and tasting phases
of each dish:
As can be seen in the graph, the average emotional intensity
level of the first half of the experience is 23,8% higher than that
of the second half (0.52 versus 0.42). This raises a possible partial
conclusion about the fatigue of the diners, after the midway point
of the experience, the moment from which the main dishes and
desserts arrive.
The following graphs (Figures 8, 9) show the average
percentage of each dish with respect to the GSR and each
interpretation value of brain activity obtained using the
EEG (Table 2).

Phase 2

presentation and tasting phases (joint data) of each dish are
included. Comparing the levels of emotional intensity by groups
of dishes – menu designed by the chef – of the experience,
it is observed that there is a lot of difference between these
moments, so that the starters are the ones that obtain better
ratings (with an average GSR of 0.53), followed by desserts (0.41)
and main dishes (0.38).
The emotional intensity level registered in the dishes with
special plating (the design of the plate is not standard) is then
compared with those with a conventional plating (Figure 6).
Regarding the dishes that have a special plating, it is worth noting
that their average emotional intensity level (0.48) is slightly higher
than that of the dishes with a conventional plating (0.47).
Regarding the duration of the experience, with an average of
2 h and 32 min, the authors considered analyzing the effect of

Based on the results obtained. identifying emotional intensity as
a key aspect for homeostatic balance in emotional regulation,
the authors propose a new order – agreed with the chef – that
introduces breaks (reductions in emotional intensity) to facilitate
the level of perceptual attention, interspersing dishes of higher
emotional intensity with dishes of lower emotional intensity,
forming a ridge-valley evolution, proceeding to the recording and
subsequent analysis of the results in a phase 2 of the empirical
part. Table 3 shows the proposed order, ruling out a grouping
of dishes based on snacks and starters, and main courses (but
keeping desserts for the end of the gastronomic experience):
Next, the GSR results obtained in phase 1, the starting
proposal for phase 2 (new order of dishes proposed)
and the actual result recorded in phase 2 are shown
graphically (Figure 10):

In the following graph (Figure 11), the emotional level of the
joint experience of presentation and tasting of the phase 2 dishes
is represented, whose average emotional intensity value is 0.51.
Thus, the complete experience of the dishes from phase 2 has
an average emotional intensity value higher than that of Phase 1,
by 8.51% (0.51 vs. 0.47 in phase 1).
Comparing the levels of emotional intensity according to
moments of the experience, it is observed that, in this second
phase, the first group of dishes (integration of snacks and
main courses) obtained a better record (average of 0.53). On
the other hand, desserts have registered the same valuation of
0.41 in both phases.
Similarly, there is a greater difference between the average
level of emotional intensity of special dishes, compared to
conventional dishes (0.52 vs. 0.49), improving the perception of

diners of these special dishes in the phase 2 – in the first phase
they were 0.48 and 0.47, respectively.
Note that a level of emotional intensity is observed in the first
half of the experience (before the midway point) higher than
in the second half (0.53 vs. 0.48), but lower than in phase 1 –
in the first phase were 0.52 and 0.42, respectively, which may
reflect a lower level of fatigue in the second phase of the empirical
work (proposal based on the regulation of emotional intensity
perceived by the subjects).

experience seemed very good and that they would not change
anything. The order of the dishes is very suitable and they
consider it a very complete proposal.

the interview are related to the dishes tasted, the service, the
decoration, the accessories and the overall experience. There was
a first phase of open-ended and natural recall questions (about
the experience) and a second phase of suggested recall questions.
In both phases the subjects have – in general – a clear memory
of the dishes. The experience, in general, was rated by everyone as
very good and enriching. The service, the facilities and the food
stand out (presentation, ingredients and flavors). Many would
repeat the experience. Most have been able to cite about 15 dishes,
of the 18 served, and were able to describe them quite well. As for
the order in which the dishes were served, they were remembered
in groups of starters, main courses and desserts. Among the
dishes that really stood out were Blanquet and Mostaza (due to
their flavors), as well as Brioche (option to be able to interact).
All diners remember the originality of the plating for some
dishes, such as Mostaza, Polen, Gamba, Arroz or dessert dishes,
since they represent very well the food on offer.

DISCUSSION
The first part of the study analyses the intersection between
consumer behavior, sensory and experiential marketing, and
haute cuisine restoration (Cerea and Rurale, 2010), with the aim
of designing a guide of recommendations to guide the design
of the most appropriate experience strategy, satisfying the needs
of haute cuisine and consumers (Olders, 2014). In this area,
neuromarketing is very useful as it allows us to efficiently obtain

the knowledge, objectivity and precision of the information, as
well as the quality of the results (Ohme et al., 2011).
From the biometry application (neuromarketing analysis), it
can be highlighted that, according to the galvanic skin response
(GSR) records, it is observed that in phase 2 the overall value of
the experience is higher than in phase 1 (Figure 10) in 8.51%,

Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org

a fact that confirms that the order of dishes proposed in phase
2 improves the assessment of the emotional intensity of the
experience (Orquin and Mueller, 2013).
The perception of the subjects of the dishes with special
plating (Ungureanu et al., 2017) allows a comparison of the level
of emotional intensity, because the shape of the dish is more

23.81%, as well as the interaction with the dishes (Sterner, 1997).
The approach of a plate order model based on improving the level
of perceptual attention leads to greater activation and emotional
intensity in phase 2, after the midway point of the experience,
decreasing to 10.42%.
The breakdown of the emotional level into three groups:
starters, main dishes and desserts, allows us to observe that in
phase 1 there is a range of responses, with the starters obtaining
better valuations (GSR average of 0.53, compared to main dishes

attractive (Bloch, 1995) than in the case of conventional dishes.
The same effect occurs in both phases, obtaining an average of
2.12% higher than the emotional intensity level of the dishes
with special plating. Furthermore, this difference is even more
pronounced in phase 2 (6.12%).
The study of the level of emotional intensity of the first 9 dishes
(before the midway point of the experience), comparing them
with the following 9 dishes, reveals that the level of emotional
intensity decreases over time (Parker and Tavassoli, 2000) to a

and desserts, with values of 0.38 and 0.41, respectively). In phase
2, since there was no division between starters and main dishes,
it was broken down into 2 groups: starters / main and desserts,
with better ratings also being observed in the first block (average
value of GSR equal to 0.53). Although with the order of dishes
proposed in phase 2, the emotional intensity of the main dishes is
increased (compared to phase 1), since the tandem starters plus
main dishes of phase 2, obtain the same average as the starters
of phase 1. On the other hand, desserts have registered the same
evaluation in both phases.
According to the records of brain electrical activity -EEG(Fakhruzzaman et al., 2015) note that the average of phase 2 is
higher than that of phase 1: the values of Engagement, Excitement
and Interest are higher in the Phase 2, compared to 1. The stress
has the same value in both phases, and the other 2 registers,

Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org

Relaxation and Focus, are slightly higher in Phase 1. The average
EEG values of phase 2 exceed those of the phase 1, both before
the midway point of the experience, and after. This also occurs
with the GSR values, reflecting the order proposed for the stimuli
(Darchambeau, 2005).
Regarding the information obtained from the application
of the eye tracking technique (Duchowski, 2007) it is worth
commenting that the common denominator in the dishes is
that the diner, during the presentation of a dish alternates
attention between the Chef and the dish, although in the
most striking dishes, the dish is contemplated for a longer
time than the Chef. Moreover, during the tasting of the
dishes, the diner mainly focuses on looking at the dish he is
tasting, especially on those dishes in which the dish must be
interacted with.

the tasting experience, using qualitative research techniques and
neuromarketing. The analysis takes into account the different
aspects of the experience, establishing the variables on which the
research is focused, such as eye trajectory, galvanic response of
the skin and recording of brain waves.
The greatest contribution of this research has been the design
of a new order of the menu of dishes of a tasting experience,
based on the metrics of the levels of emotional intensity of
the diners. This has allowed us to know the results in the
levels of emotional intensity (arousal) of the consumer caused
by a proposal to change the order of the dishes, as well as to
identify the most highly valued aspects in the consumption of
gastronomic experiences, suggested shopping and consumption
habits, (understand when the customer would buy a gastronomic
experience), the gastronomic projections of the target audience
based on the restaurant’s and chef ’s brand, and the level of
brand memory, product and service, after the high gastronomic
experience kitchen.
This research has contributed to the analysis, from the
neuromarketing perspective, of the cognitive and emotional
options of consumers regarding gastronomic products (Sturiale
and Scuderi, 2017). The results can be used to support specific
improvement campaigns, through the use of a communication
that highlights the emotional components of the purchasing
process. Thus, we can speak of a regulation of emotions,
referring to processes by which people regulate positive or
negative emotions over time, automatically and unconsciously
or in a conscious and controlled manner. The purpose of this
emotional regulation is to reduce, maintain or intensify the
emotional experience resulting from exposure to the stimulus
(Gross and Thompson, 2007).
This line of research can be continued with the analysis of the
influence of the wine, the duration of the experience, the variation
of the emotional impact when repeating it by consumers, or the
reversal of the order of the dishes (desserts at the beginning, main
dishes in the middle and starters at the end), as proposed by some

From the application of traditional marketing (in-depth
interview), it can be highlighted that the experience was generally
valued by all as very good and enriching in both phases,
since satisfied consumers consider their expectations met (Ran
et al., 2016). However, consumers are delighted when they have
lived an experience that meets their expectations (MartínezRuiz et al., 2017). The approach to a sensory experience works
with a language capable of activating each of the consumer’s
five senses (Lindstrom, 2008). Sensory stimulation positively
influences the brand experience and its value, which favorably
impacts the purchase intention (Moreira et al., 2017) evoking
sensations or feelings associated with the brand (Elder et al., 2011;
Mercado, 2018).
Changes in consumer habits make traditional marketing
approaches less effective (Wohlfeil and Whelan, 2005). Today’s
clients are more independent than ever, and advertising is less
effective and more expensive every day (Madinaveitia, 2018).
It is important to know how consumers experience brands
(Lenderman, 2008) since the differential offer of experiences
(Pine et al., 1999) being memorable and personalized, can help
protect the company from the erosion of its profit margins
and prices, as a result of commoditization of supply and
undifferentiation (Pine and Gilmore, 1998; Schmitt et al., 2003).
The limitations considered in this research have been the
influence of the restaurant’s name, its geographical location,
the chef ’s public recognition, the presence of the wine and
the sommelier, the influence of repeating the experience or
reducing its duration.

CONCLUSION
The main objective of this study was the emotional analysis of
the experience of tasting a menu of a restaurant with 2 Michelin
stars, through neuromarketing, using equipment and knowledge
of neuroscience. The methodology performs a global analysis of

renowned chefs worldwide. Likewise, contrast the emotional
levels of high-quality traditional menus against haute cuisine
menus with innovative experiences, or contrast the results of a
quantitative investigation with those obtained in the combination
of neuromarketing and qualitative research.
Regarding the application of this neuromarketing analysis
perspective to other possible areas or sectors, the authors consider
that there are key sectors (due to the high emotional component
of the product) in which applying this methodology would be
very interesting, such as the footwear sectors, clothing, jewelry,
luxury vehicles or real estate.
Finally, this study revealed that knowledge of the conscious
and unconscious mental states of the consumers allows the design
of much more efficient commercial strategies, since it is based on
a deeper knowledge of the stimuli that influence the brain and,
in turn, consumer behavior and decision making (Morin, 2011).
Considering also that consumer habits change, organizations
must generate other types of proposals and actions for each
contact or communication carried out with their consumers,
through all the aspects that accompany the brand, generating a
link through the stimulation of the senses and experiences with
high emotional charges.
