Background and Objectives: The gap prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response
has been used to screen tinnitus in an animal model. Here, we examined changes in the auditory late response under various conditions of gap prepulse inhibition. Subjects and Methods: We recruited 19 healthy adults (5 males, 14 females) and their auditory late responses
were recorded after various stimuli with or without gap prepulsing. The N1 and P2 responses
were selected for analysis. The gap prepulse inhibition was estimated to determine the optimal auditory late response in the gap prepulse paradigm. Results: We found that the gap
per se generated a response that was very similar to the response elicited by sound stimuli.
This critically affected the gap associated with the maximal inhibition of the stimulus response. Among the various gap-stimulus intervals (GSIs) between the gap and principal
stimulus, the GSI of 150 ms maximally inhibited the response. However, after zero padding
was used to minimize artifacts after a P2 response to a gap stimulus, the differences among
the GSIs disappeared. Conclusions: Overall, the data suggest that both the prepulse inhibition and the gap per se should be considered when using the gap prepulse paradigm to
assess tinnitus in humans.

Introduction
An auditory evoked response (AER) is an electrical potential evoked by an external auditory stimulus. The AER is
thought to provide useful neurophysiological information because of its sensitive temporal resolution. Among the various
AER components, the N1 and P2 peaks of the auditory late
response (ALR) represent auditory perception and provide
information about the psychological state of an individual [1].
Experiments using a model of neurophysiological tinnitus indicated that these components affect tinnitus [1,2]. The N1 and
P2 components differ significantly between tinnitus patients
and healthy subjects [2].

Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a general neurological phenomenon wherein the magnitude of a response to a principal stimulus is reduced when a certain stimulus precedes it by 30500 ms [3]. PPI is indicative of sensorimotor gating and can
be affected by various factors such as drugs, attention, and
psychological issues [4,5]. Recent studies have demonstrated
that prepulsing reduced the magnitudes of the cortical auditory
evoked potentials (AEPs; P50, N1, P2, and P300) in healthy
humans [5].
Advances in the methods of tinnitus assessment in animals
have facilitated significant developments in tinnitus research.
Turner, et al. [6] used a novel method termed gap PPI (gPPI)
of the acoustic startle reflex to screen for tinnitus in an animal
model. This new paradigm is based on the concept that a gap
in the auditory stimulus serves as a prepulse and affects the
acoustic startle response. By providing a gap before the main
stimulus, in the presence of background noise similar to tinni-

tus, the startle response of an animal was reduced due to PPI.
However, such inhibition was not evident in animals with
tinnitus. Several studies have used this model to measure behavioral changes in various animals with noise-induced tinnitus [7,8].
Previous studies have investigated the relationship between
the human startle reflex and PPI in the presence of various
levels of background noise; a prepulse sound inhibited the
startle response in humans [9,10]. In humans, an eye-blink
startle response is typically measured using electromyography of the orbicularis oculi muscle [3]. Some studies have reported an inhibited response after a small pulse sound, especially in patients with insomnia [11] and traumatic stress disorder
[12]. We speculate that the prepulse paradigm can also be used
for evaluating humans; the startle response is replaced by the
ALR when tinnitus is present.
Ku, et al. [13] used the gPPI paradigm with humans to evaluate if it could be used for the objective assessment of tinnitus.
It was found that the auditory responses of the N1P2 complex
were stable. The N1P2 ratios under gap and no-gap conditions differed marginally, depending on the gap duration,
gap-stimulus interval (GSI), level of background noise, and
response attained at the maximum noise level with the shortest
gap duration (20 ms) and the lowest level of background noise.
However, as the recording of AEPs with short repetition rates
is uncommon because of overlapping neural responses [14],
an ALR may include a response due to a preceding gap if
there is only a short interval prior to the main stimulus. This
possibility should be considered if a gap serves as an “auditory stimulus” that can itself evoke an auditory response.

We explored the possibility that a “gap” can serve as a stimulus for generating an auditory response at the cortical level.
We also examined the feasibility of the gPPI paradigm for
ALR measurement and investigated the differences in gPPI
values derived using various GSIs between a gap prepulse
and the principal pulse. Additionally, we investigated the effects of gap-only stimuli in the gap prepulse paradigm by correcting for the responses evoked by the gap prepulse stimuli.
Our results demonstrate how the positioning of the gap prepulse affects the gPPI.

Subjects and Methods
Subjects
We enrolled 19 adults (5 males, 14 females) with a mean
age of 28.68 years (range 21-50 years). None of the participants had any history of tinnitus or neurological disease. Their
hearing was normal, as shown by pure tone audiometry at
500, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 Hz; all hearing thresholds were
below 25 dB HL (hearing level) at all tested frequencies. This
study was approved by the Institutional Board of Dankook
University Hospital (DKUH 2013-08-009).
ALR measurement
The system used to measure ALR is described in Fig. 1.
ALR potentials were measured using the wireless electroencephalogram (EEG) neuroheadset device (Epoc, EMOTIV
Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA) and the computer-based custom data acquisition (DAQ) (NI PXI-6251, National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) system (ALR system algorithm)

(Fig. 1). The system featured the DAQ software, EEG amplification and logging software, an EEG trigger, and the auditory
response signal collection software.
Stimulus and response processing
The stimuli used are shown in Fig. 2. All stimuli included a
continuous background noise with duration of 1,000 ms. The
principal pulse (white noise) was 80 dB SPL (sound pressure
level) and 20 ms in duration, delivered within a 500 ms stimulus train. To measure gap-only responses, stimuli of a 50 ms
gap presented at the 400 ms time point within the background
noise (8 kHz, 1/3 octave band) of 60 dB SPL was used (Fig. 2).
Except when gap-only stimuli were delivered, both the gap
and principal stimuli within the background noise were considered a single stimulus (Fig. 2). Gaps were placed at three
different time points in the stimulus train: GSIs of 50, 150, and
250 ms. The stimuli were randomly presented at inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) of 1-3 s to avoid adaptation and temporal
prediction of the acoustic stimuli, using the ER-A3 (Etymotic
Research, Elk Grove Village, IL, USA) insert earphone.
ALR measurements and response processing
All ALRs were measured in a double-walled soundproofed

room. Participants were seated in comfortable chairs, and an
inspector ensured that they did not sleep or engage in habitual
movements. The common mode sense electrode was placed
on the ipsilateral ear (reference) and the driven light leg electrode was placed on the contralateral earlobe (ground). Headgear with four channel electrodes (AF3, AF4, F3, and F4) was
placed, and measurements commenced when the impedances
of all electrodes were ≤5 kΩ. Stimuli were delivered (via the
earphone) to the left ear, and the contralateral ear was blocked
with a sponge earplug (KE-1100, Moden zone, Seoul, Korea).
For each subject, three 5 min measurements at a 128 Hz
sampling rate were made. The responses were processed using
a software, and the responses to no-gap and with-gap stimuli
were displayed as bold and dotted lines, respectively (Fig. 3).
EEG signals transferred to the computer were processed
using specialized software. Both baseline drift and high-frequency noise were removed using a 1-30 Hz band-pass filter.
The responses with or without gap prepulse were averaged.
With- and without-gap responses are presented together; the
ranges of interest including N1 (first negative peak) and P2
(second positive peak) are highlighted using yellow bars. The
amplitudes of with- and without-gap responses were automatically calculated from the N1P2 amplitude, within the region

Auditory Late Response after Gap Prepulse Stimulus

Data analysis
Epoch durations of 1,000 ms (which are sufficient to include all responses to the longest GSI) were analyzed. Four
peaks developing within 0.4 to 0.8 ms were measured: N1,
P1, N2, and P2 peaks. Of these, the N1 and P2 peaks after
both no-gap and gap stimuli were automatically identified,
and the gPPI was defined using the following equation:
gPPI=

N1P2no gap-N1P2gap
N1P2no gap

Zero padding was applied to the corrected data. The responses after the zero-crossing points of P2N2 waves after
gap-only stimuli were set to zero. Thus, the ALR gap-only response was subtracted from the response after both a gap and
a principal pulse. Mean and standard deviation (mean±SD)
of all peak amplitudes were compared.
Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the
Social Sciences ver. 19 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni post-hoc and paired ttest were used to determine the effect of GSI on the gPPI.

Results
Effects of gap prepulsing on N1P2 amplitudes at
different GSIs
All responses were averaged, yielding the grand-averaged
data. The grand-averaged ALR after an 80 dB SPL (8 kHz)

stimulus is shown in Fig. 3. The N1P2 amplitude was 8.66 µV,
and the N1 and P2 latencies were 0.6 and 0.69 ms, respectively. The N1P2 amplitude decreased when a silent gap (50 ms)
was inserted prior to the principal stimulus (Fig. 3). In this case,
the N1P2 amplitude was 4.96 µV. The N1P2 amplitudes
(mean±SD) at different GSIs are listed in Table 1. A GSI of 50
ms resulted in the greatest decrease in the N1P2 amplitude.
We calculated gPPI values to explore ALR changes at various GSIs. The gPPI values at GSIs of 50, 150, and 250 ms
are shown in Fig. 4. The gPPI was maximal at the GSI of 50
ms and decreased as the GSI increased. We used the paired ttest to explore how the GSI affected the gPPI. Significant
differences between the gPPI values at GSIs of 50 and 150
ms (p=0.012), and at GSIs of 50 and 250 ms (p=0.001), were
apparent, but not between the gPPI values at GSIs of 150
and 250 ms (p=0.435).

was applied prior to the principal stimulus is assumed to reflect the PPI of the N1P2 response. Moreover, the gap prepulse-induced auditory response may generate interference.
Previously, several studies have reported that the AEPs evoked
within 300 ms of multiple stimuli changed if they were overlaid with auditory responses [15,16]. Thus, we first measured
the ALR under gap-only conditions (within background noise),
and acquired evoked responses that were morphologically
similar to those evoked by the principal sound stimulus (Fig. 5).
All peak latencies were also similar (N1=0.56, P2=0.64). Thus,
the decrease in the N1P2 amplitude of the gap response may
reflect the simple mathematical summation of the two waveforms (the gap-only and no-gap responses). To explore this
possibility, we corrected each ALR response by subtracting
the auditory response elicited by the gap-only stimulus, and
then averaged the responses to derive a corrected grand-average gPPI. The N1P2 amplitudes after correction of the data
obtained at various GSIs are listed in Table 2.
The gPPI values after correction are shown in Fig. 6. The
mean±SD gPPI values were 18.59±27.47%, 2.26±24.62%,
and 17.93±12.7% at GSIs of 50, 150, and 250 ms, respectively.
The value was highest at the GSI of 50 ms, decreased markedly
at 150 ms, and increased again at 250 ms. We used the paired
t-test to examine the effect of the GSI on the corrected gPPI
values. The gPPI values at GSIs of 150 and 250 ms differed sig-

nificantly (p=0.011), but those at GSIs of 50 and 150 ms (p=
0.058) and 50 and 250 ms (p=0.922) did not.
The gPPI values after zero padding
ALRs can be classified as exogenous and endogenous responses, depending on latency [17]. An exogenous response
is highly dependent on the physical properties of the stimulus, whereas an endogenous response varies with the characteristics of the stimulus and psychological status of the subject
[17]. As PPI was apparent even after a very brief GSI, we
considered that such inhibition was more indicative of an exogenous rather than an endogenous response. Thus, we zero
padded the gap-only response to minimize any effect of an
endogenous response. All responses after zero-padding correction were averaged to obtain corrected grand-averaged gPPI
values. The values at GSIs of 50, 150, and 250 ms are shown
in Fig. 7. The highest value occurred at the GSI of 50 ms,
and the lowest at the GSI of 250 ms.
All gPPI values associated with gap-only stimuli were subjected to zero-padding correction (Table 3). The mean±SD
gPPI values were 18.31±22.17%, 14.49±17.16%, and 13.07±
11.73% at GSIs of 50, 150, and 250 ms, respectively (Fig. 8).
The highest gPPI value occurred at the GSI of 50 ms and then
decreased as the GSI increased. We used the paired t-test to analyze the effect of the GSI; no difference was apparent among
the GSIs of 50, 150, and 250 ms.

that the ALR was inhibited by a gap prepulse. This was in line
with the assumption that an AER can be generated using the
gap prepulse paradigm [18]. Recently, various gap parameters
have been shown to inhibit the effects of a gap prepulse on the
ALR [19] and the eye-blink reflex in healthy adults [20]. Our
results are similar to those of Ku, et al. [13]. Furthermore, although direct comparisons of our data with those of animal
studies would be inappropriate, we measured human responses derived using the gap prepulse paradigm; the results
were similar to those of animal studies. Therefore, we support
the use of the gap prepulse paradigm for tinnitus assessment
in humans.
The ALR responses obtained using various GSIs showed
that gap placement 50 ms prior to the principal stimulus resulted in the greatest inhibition of the response. Previous work
on gPPI focused on gap duration; a longer gap prepulse was
associated with greater inhibition, both for a simple gap prepulse and a gap following a prepulse when background noise
was lacking between the gap and principal pulse [21]. Although
a recent study on gPPI in healthy adult humans reported that
the GSI did not affect the response [13], all GSIs were <100
ms. It is possible that other factors (such as gap offset or onset and background noise) affect the ALR response. Thus,
the study does not confirm that the GSI between the gap and
the principal stimulus is irrelevant in the context of the gap
prepulse paradigm. We found that responses varied signifi-

cantly with the GSI, even after the gap-only stimulus was subtracted. Our data and previous results suggest that further studies using GSIs of various durations <100 ms, with gap response
subtraction, are required to confirm whether the GSI influences
the gap prepulse paradigm in humans.
We found that the GSI of 250 ms also inhibited the response
to the principal stimulus, albeit not as markedly as the GSIs
of 50 and 150 ms. However, the GSI of 250 ms is clinically
relevant, and temporal summation is impossible. Blumenthal
[9] reported that the extent of the eye-blink inhibition by a prepulse depended on the prepulse duration and the interval between the prepulse offset and the onset of the principal pulse (the
GSI in our present study). However, all GSIs applied were between 100 and 144 ms. Furthermore, whether the GSI of 50 ms
was more inhibitory than GSIs of 150 or 250 ms was not investigated. Therefore, the ALR response under gap prepulse
conditions is influenced not only by gap duration but also by
a GSI >150 ms.
To identify the pure inhibitory effects of all GSIs, we subtracted the responses evoked by gap prepulsing; such prepulses were not inhibitory at the GSI of 150 ms. This is an interesting finding as it shows that the effect of the gap prepulse
on the ALR depends on the GSI, and at some GSIs, the effect
is saturated. We considered many other factors that might explain this result. As the AEP is very sensitive to measurement
conditions and long measurement times, extreme caution is
required during experiments for estimating such potentials.
Grand-averaged data indicate gPPI trends. We sought to average all data obtained using the same GSIs; these are the most
generalizable results of our study. Although statistical analysis
was not possible, the most prominent inhibition was associated with the GSI of 50 ms, and the ALR response after a gap
prepulse was more inhibited at shorter GSIs. Previous studies
have proposed the use of the gap prepulse inhibition paradigm
for tinnitus assessment in clinics [13,22]. We also concluded
that it could be a useful assessment tool for patients with tinnitus. However, according to our results, the gap prepulse itself
and application of zero padding affect the result of the auditory
brainstem response (ABR) after a gap prepulse stimulus, and
these effects should be considered in this paradigm.
The N1P2 peak has been used to evaluate cochlear implants [23], explore the effects of drugs on auditory cognition [24], and functionally assess patients with schizophrenia
[25]. Ku, et al. [13] reported that the N1P2 amplitude peak
was the most prominent of the various ALR peaks (N1, P2,
N2, N1P2, and P2N2) in the gap prepulse paradigm. These
studies suggest that our evaluation of the N1P2 peak of the
gPPI ratio is appropriate when applying the paradigm. Sensory gating (inhibition of the AER by a prepulse) has also

Lee JH, et al.

been evaluated [26-28]. Several works have explored the relationship between the eye-blink response and the AER (especially N1P2) in the context of the prepulse paradigm, and
suggested that different mechanisms are in play [27,28]. As
the eye-blink is a behavioral response that is easily influenced
by a subject’s intention, assessment of an AER, especially an
N1P2 response, is appropriate for tinnitus evaluation. However, the utility of the paradigm for children should be carefully considered, as ALR responses do not fully represent auditory sensitivity until late adolescence.
Multiple or paired stimuli delivered at various GSIs have
been used to evaluate the auditory processing capacity [29].
However, when evaluating cortical responses, rapid re-presentation rates trigger response overlaps, making it difficult
to interpret the results [14]. We found that a gap per se in the
background noise evoked auditory responses. The response
patterns associated with gaps in the background noise were
very similar to the responses to sound stimuli. The relatively
large baseline fluctuation noted in a previous study wherein gap
prepulse stimuli was applied [19] may be attributed to overlaps. A recent study showed that use of the gPPI paradigm was
associated with similar auditory responses in both tinnitus
patients and normal subjects, perhaps because of a similar issue with overlap [22]. We used zero padding to eliminate any
possibility of remnant wave fluctuation even after allowing
sufficient time for a cortical response. After zero-padding correction, the gPPI did not vary according to the GSI. This challenges the conclusion of a previous study that the AEP varies
with the time between the gap and principal stimulus in the
gap prepulse paradigm. In conclusion, both the effect of a gap
per se and that of the PPI should be considered when using
the gap prepulse paradigm to evaluate humans.
