Abstract
Prolonged auditory sensory deprivation leads to brain reorganization, indicated by functional
enhancement in remaining sensory systems, a phenomenon known as cross-modal plasticity.
In this study we investigated differences in functional brain network shifts from eyes-closed
to eyes-open conditions between deaf and hearing people. Electroencephalography activity
was recorded in deaf (N = 71) and hearing people (N = 122) living in rural Africa, which
yielded a unique data-set of congenital, pre-lingual and post-lingual deaf people, with a
divergent experience in American Sign Language. Functional networks were determined from
the synchronization of electroencephalography signals between fourteen electrodes distributed
over the scalp. We studied the synchronization between the auditory and visual cortex and
performed whole-brain minimum spanning tree analysis based on the phase lag index of
functional connectivity. This tree analysis accounts for variations in global network density
and allows unbiased characterization of functional network backbones. We found increased
functional connectivity between the auditory and visual cortex in deaf people during the eyesclosed condition in both the alpha and beta bands. Furthermore, we found functional network
backbone shifts both in deaf and healthy people as they went from eyes-closed to eyes-open
conditions. In both the alpha and beta band the deafs’ brain showed larger functional
backbone-shifts in node strength compared to controls. In the alpha band this shift in network
strength differed among deaf participants and depended on type of deafness: congenital, prelingual or post-lingual deafness. In addition, a correlation was found between functional
backbone characteristics and experience of sign language. Our study revealed more insights in
functional network reorganization specifically due to prolonged lack of auditory input, but
might also be helpful for sensory deprivation and cross-modal plasticity in general. Global
cortical network reorganization in deaf people supports the plastic capacities of the young
brain. The differences between type of deafness stresses that etiology affects functional

Introduction
Audition is an important sensory modality, which is essential for daily life and
communication. Impairment or loss of hearing interferes with many activities, specifically
limiting communication with others, which could easily lead to social isolation. The
prevalence of this serious disability is greatest in middle- and low-income countries (Durkin,
2002; Stevens et al., 2013; WHO, 2014). While in the United States about two out of every
1,000 children is born with disabling hearing loss (Vohr, 2003), this number is considerably
higher in Sub-Saharan Africa where about two percent of the children is born with disabling
hearing loss (WHO, 2012). A subset of these children has profound hearing loss, resulting in
absolute deafness. Infectious diseases are a major cause of deafness in these regions
(Mulwafu et al., 2016).
Prolonged periods of deafness are believed to cause profound neural reorganization
related to functional enhancement in remaining sensory systems, which is referred to as crossmodal plasticity (Bavelier and Neville, 2002; Merabet and Pascual-Leone, 2010; Ptito et al.,
2001). Deaf people have to rely more on visual input (and input from other modalities), which
consequently leads to increased involvement of neuronal networks processing visual
information (Bavelier et al., 2006; Bosworth and Dobkins, 2002; Brozinsky and Bavelier,
2004; Dye et al., 2007; Finney and Dobkins, 2001; Hauser et al., 2007). While this
reorganization occurs inevitably as a result of profound deafness, cross-modal plasticity is
also strongly related to the acquisition and use of sign language and lip reading (Meyer et al.,
2007; Pénicaud et al., 2013). Furthermore, the extent of cross-modal plasticity is also
dependent on the age of onset and the duration of deafness (Brotherton et al., 2016; Li et al.,
2013), as well as on the use of hearing aid and degree of auditory deprivation (Doucet et al.,
2006; Shiell et al., 2014). Cross-modal plasticity has been reported in different studies on deaf
as well as blind people (Collignon et al., 2011; Klinge et al., 2010; Lewis et al., 2010; Liu et
al., 2007; Ptito and Kupers, 2005; Renier et al., 2014; Théoret et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2008).

Brain mapping techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
electroencephalography (EEG) enable detection of functional neural reorganization in deaf (as
compared to hearing people), as well as assessment of differences between early-deafness and
late-deafness, e.g. by using task-based or resting-state paradigms. For example it has been
shown that cortical auditory or auditory association areas in deaf people are responsive to
visual motion stimuli. These auditory regions include the planum temporale (Petitto, 2000;
Sadato et al., 2005; Shiell et al., 2016) and primary auditory cortices, like posterior superior
temporal gyrus (Almeida et al., 2015; Ding et al., 2015; Karns et al., 2012; Li et al., 2015) and
Hechl’s gyrus (Karns et al., 2012; Meyer et al., 2007; Scott et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2011).
Furthermore, functional MRI studies have shown that the middle superior temporal sulcus is
more prominently activated by visual stimuli in early-deaf subjects than in late-deaf subjects
(Li et al., 2013; Neville et al., 1998; Sadato et al., 2004). Although these task-based
approaches have provided valuable insights in cross-modal plasticity, they do not take into
account the mutual dependency of different functional regions and the integrative nature of
the human brain to process auditory information (Hackett, 2012).
The human brain forms a complex integrative network, which consists of spatially
distributed, but functionally connected (i.e. synchronized activated) regions that continuously
interact with each other (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009; van den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol,
2010). Brain function and reorganization can only be properly understood when studied in

approach to assess organizational aspects of functional brain networks is provided by graph
analysis (Bullmore and Sporns, 2012). Graph analysis describes a complex system like the
human brain, as a set of nodes (i.e. functional brain regions such as the auditory or visual
cortex) and edges or ties (i.e. the functional connections between regions), and provides

quantitative information on the topological properties of networks (Bullmore and Sporns,
2009; Heuvel et al., 2012; Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). It has been shown that the healthy
human brain can be characterized as a complex network that effectively combines integration
(i.e. global efficiency, indicated by a short average path length) and segregation (i.e.
functionally specialized brain regions (Bullmore and Sporns, 2012), indicated by a high
clustering coefficient), which together is defined as a small-world organization (Bullmore and
Sporns, 2009; Watts and Strogatz, 1998). Other important aspects of brain organization,
typified by graph analyses, are modularity (i.e. different functional modules) and hubness (i.e.
relatively small number of highly connected nodes) (Barabasi and Albert, 1999).
So far only a few studies have used graph analysis to examine structural or functional
brain networks in deaf subjects. Kim et al. showed that pre-lingual deaf adults have altered
morphological networks compared to normal controls, whereas post-lingual deaf adults did
not show differences with normal controls, indicating that auditory experience might affect
the morphology of brain networks in deaf adults (Kim et al., 2014). Li et al. (2016) showed
increased connectivity between the limbic system and regions involved in visual and language
processing, as well as decreased connectivity between the visual and language processing
regions. However small-worldness was not changed in pre-lingual deaf adults as compared to
hearing controls (Li et al., 2016).
Although classical graph analysis has revealed significant aspects of brain
reorganization in deaf people, and despite its potential and popularity (Giusti et al., 2016), it
has some intrinsic limitations, particularly for inter-subject or between-group comparisons
where network sizes and densities are different (van Wijk et al., 2010). Commonly used
network metrics, such as the clustering coefficient (i.e. segregation) and average path length
(i.e. integration or global efficiency) are highly affected by the number of connections (i.e.
density) and average degree (i.e. mean number of connections per node) of a network (Stam et

al., 2014; van Wijk et al., 2010). Hence, comparing healthy and affected (or reorganized)
brain networks might give biased results (Tewarie et al., 2015; van Wijk et al., 2010; Zalesky
et al., 2010). A promising alternative analysis approach, which might solve these limitations,
is selective assessment of the functional network backbone by means of the minimum
spanning tree method. Network backbone analysis allows for unbiased comparison of
networks since all minimum spanning trees have the same size and density (Stam et al., 2014;
Tewarie et al., 2015). An increasing number of studies have shown the usefulness of this
approach in capturing subtle network changes in brain development and ageing (Boersma et
al., 2013; Otte et al., 2015; Smit et al., 2016; Vourkas et al., 2014) but also in brain diseases,
like multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease and epilepsy (Engels et al., 2015; Tewarie et al.,
2014; van Diessen et al., 2016, 2014).
In the present study we investigated the effects of prolonged periods of deafness on
topological characteristics of brain functional network backbones. Therefore we acquired
resting-state electroencephalograms from both healthy controls and congenital, pre-lingual
and post-lingual deaf people in eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. Opening and closing
the eyes are very basic attention-directing behaviors (i.e. towards the internal or external
world) (Xu et al., 2014), related to different brain states (Marx et al., 2004; Zhang et al.,
2015). Moreover, deaf people completely lack audiovisual input during the eyes-closed
condition. We made use of a unique homogeneous population in a representative rural region
in sub-Saharan Africa where deafness is a common disability but cochlear implants are not
available. The study of brain plasticity in deaf people in countries with a well-established
health-care system is complicated as many people with hearing disabilities will have a
cochlear implant. Cochlear implants changes the brain organization, including functional
cortical reorganizations at rest (Strelnikov et al., 2010). If the implantation is done early,

auditory language develops almost normally in those people (Hammes et al., 2002). In our
study population none of the people had a cochlear implantation.
Electroencephalography recordings were used to construct functional networks and
functional network backbones. We hypothesized enhanced functional connectivity between
auditory and visual cortex in deaf people. In addition that functional network backbones differ
between healthy and deaf people, indicating that sensory processing is a distributed brain
function. As deaf people hardly get any sensory input when they are in resting-state condition
with eyes closed, we speculated that we would detect larger network backbone-shifts between
eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions in deaf people as compared to healthy controls. Lastly,
we anticipated the backbone characteristics in deaf people to be related to years of American
Sign Language (ASL) experience.

Methods
Study setting and ethics
The study pipeline as described below is visualized in Figure 1. Our study was conducted at
two inclusive primary schools and one inclusive secondary school located at two separate
rural places in Ebonyi State, southeast Nigeria in September-October 2016, which are part of
a Community-Based Rehabilitation (CBR) program. In this inclusive education schools all
community students, with or without disability, attend and are welcomed in age-appropriate,
regular classes and are supported to learn, contribute and participate in all aspects of the life
of the school. Standard ASL is taught at those Nigerian schools for more than twenty years.
So all students, deaf and non-deaf learn sign language. This educational approach is a
potential strategy to reduce the burden of disability (Eleweke and Rodda, 2002; Pförtner,
2014). The distribution of students with and without disabilities is about equal. The lessons
are taught in English and if the teacher does not know sign language there is an interpreter for
the deaf students. Every class consists of non-disabled as well as (a maximum of fifty percent)
disabled students. Deaf children receive lessons in both Sign Language and Speech therapy.
All children live in the surrounding villages for full integration within the community. In this
way many people in the community master and/or understand Sign Language as well.
Our study was approved in by the organizational boards (RBC/CBR Effata) and the
local health ministry (Izzi, Local Government Area) and federal government (Ebonyi State
House of Assembly, Abakaliki [7-11-2016]) in Nigeria. Written informed consent was
obtained from adult participants and caretakers of children below eighteen years. Assent was
obtained from the children. Prior to asking volunteers for the recordings, the study protocol
was clearly explained to all students in class.

Participants
Table 1 shows the demographic information of all participants. We included 193 participants
between ten and 43 years old (mean age of 18.5 (standard deviation 6.0); gender: 103 male,
90 female), both students and teachers. Sign language experience of participants varied
between zero and seventeen years at the time of recording. We selected two groups: hearing
(n=122) and deaf (n=71) participants. The pre-lingual deaf participants were all capable of lip
reading.

Data acquisition
We used a high-resolution sixteen sensor / fourteen channel EEG monitor configured to
sample at 128 Hertz with a 16-bit resolution (EMOTIV Inc, San Francisco, USA) (Aspinall et
al., 2013; Badcock et al., 2015; McMahan et al., 2015; Prause et al., 2016; Yu and Sim, 2016).
This wireless headset can be connected to a computer via Bluetooth and is an invaluable tool
to collect EEG signals from participants in rural or resource-limited areas, where access to a
clinical type of EEG system is often impossible or burdensome. Two sensors were preserved
for reference and grounding: the ‘common mode sense’ (CMS; located at P3) sensor was used
as the active reference for absolute referencing. The ‘driven right leg’ (DRL; located at P4)
sensor was used for feedback noise cancelation. The electrodes were located at anterofrontal
(AF3, AF4, F3, F4, F7, F8), frontocentral (FC5, FC6), occipital (O1, O2), parietal (P7, P8)
and temporal sites (T7, T8), according to the International 10–20 system. Signal quality
scores are recorded for each electrode with a range of one to five (no units), with five as best
quality.
Participants were asked to sit on a chair in a quiet room for five minutes while wearing
the Emotiv headset. They were instructed to keep their eyes closed for the first three minutes
and open in the next two minutes. The order of the conditions (i.e. ‘eyes closed’ or ‘eyes
open’) was assigned alternatingly, so that half of the participants started in the ‘eyes open

condition’ whereas the other half of the participants started in the ‘eyes closed condition’. The
researcher kept a log on deviations from the protocol or unusual events in the environment
that may affect the experiment. Example recordings are shown in Figure 2. The
electroencephalography signals were band-pass filtered into the delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta (4–8
Hz), alpha (8–16 Hz), beta (16–32 Hz) and gamma (32–64 Hz) frequency bands (examples
shown in Suppl. Figure 1 and 2).

Data cleaning and window selection
Time segments of the recordings were removed if i) the research log indicated a deviation
from the protocol, ii) the electroencephalography signal quality score was below four for any
of the channels, and iii) if the absolute deviation of the gyroscope signals relative to the
gyroscope signal median was larger than five times the standard deviation. This threshold was
based on visual data inspection (See example in Suppl. Figure 3). The cleaned filtered data
were cut into 10-sec epochs. Functional connectivity and multiple network backbone metrics
– calculated in a similar way as in our study – stabilize within recordings if the minimal epoch
length is at least six seconds (Fraschini et al., 2016). Therefore we used this conservative 10sec length. Multiple epochs per subject result in stable network backbone metrics (van
Diessen et al., 2015).

Functional connectivity
For each epoch a functional network was constructed. Recorded time-series within each epoch
were used to determine functional connectivity between different electrodes capturing
neuronal signals from underlying brain areas. Functional connectivity was computed and
quantified with the phase lag index. This is a measure of the asymmetry of the distribution of
instantaneous phase differences between two time series and scales between zero and one
(Pillai and Sperling, 2006). It is relative resistant to the influence of common sources,

including volume conduction and active reference electrodes. An index of zero indicates no
phase coupling between time series, or coupling with a phase difference centered on zero ± p
radians. A non-zero index indicates the presence of phase coupling. A more mathematical
description of computing the phase lag index can be found elsewhere (Stam et al., 2007).

Occipital – parietal functional connectivity
We expected remodeling of the auditory cortex in deaf people reflected as enhanced
synchronization between the auditory and visual cortex. We therefore characterized in both
groups the average phase lag index between the electrodes P7/P8, covering the auditory
cortex, and the occipital electrodes O1/O2, covering the visual cortex, at eyes-open and eyesclosed conditions.

Minimum spanning tree analysis
For each functional network a minimum spanning tree (MST) was calculated from the
connectivity graph G by applying Kruskal’s algorithm (Kruskal, 1956). An MST captures the
network’s backbone and is defined as a subset of the network nodes (forming the original
weighted graph G) that connects all the nodes and does not contain cycles or loops (Jackson
and Read, 2010). A minimum spanning tree T minimizes the sum of the costs of its edges,

The following MST metrics were calculated at nodal or network level:

iii)

Diameter (d) (network): the largest distance between any two nodes in a tree, which
has a lower bound of two and an upper bound of m = N – 1. The largest possible

Statistical analyses
We compared topological network differences between congenitally deaf, pre- and post
lingually deaf and hearing subjects by means of Bayes factors extracted from Bayesian model
comparisons (Table 2). We determined the model likelihood of a null model without
interaction between group and eye condition and the likelihood of a model with an interaction
between group and eye condition for each MST network metric. Bayes factors give the ratio
of model likelihoods; thereby providing which model (i.e. the presence or absence of a
difference in the parameter change) is supported (i.e. more likely to occur). This was repeated
for each frequency band separately. Since sex (Boersma et al., 2011) and age (Smit et al.,
2012) influence functional network topologies, we included both as covariates in the analysis
to correct for potential sex- and age-related group effects.
All network analyses, statistical modeling and visualization were performed in R
(http://www.r-project.org/) using the packages igraph, BayesFactor and ggplot2. All epoch
data is available at the Open Science Framework in anonymized form (Otte et al., 2018).

Results

Occipital – parietal functional connectivity
Functional connectivity differences between eyes-open and eyes-closed in occipital-parietal
cortex are shown in Figure 3: left panel. The functional connectivity is lower in the eyesopen condition in the theta, alpha and beta frequency range. Differences are most pronounced
in the alpha frequency range with -54.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): -68.2 to -41.6%)
reduction in functional connectivity during switching from eyes-closed to eyes-open in the
control group (Figure 3: right panel). This reduction was larger in the deaf group -88.0%
(CI: -112.4 to -63.6%). Reductions in functional connectivity between eyes-closed and eyesopen were also present in the beta frequency range: -27.7% (CI: -37.3 to -18.0) in controls and
-36.1% (CI: -49.2 to -23.0) in deaf people. These alpha and beta functional connectivity
reductions were statistically significant (Table 3).

Functional backbone differences between eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions
Transition from eyes-closed condition to eyes-open condition showed visible changes in
functional network backbone characteristics. The most notable differences were found in the
alpha band and beta band, which are shown in Figure 4. In both the alpha and beta band the
backbone leaf number and kappa were lower in eyes-open condition than in eyes-closed
condition for both deaf and controls. Contrary, in both the alpha and beta band the backbone
diameter, eccentricity and radius were higher in eyes-open condition compared to eyes-closed
condition, again for both deaf and controls. Furthermore, changing from eyes-closed to eyesopen condition showed an increase in closeness centrality and a decrease in mean and
maximum node strength, in the alpha band only.

Larger functional network modifications in deaf
As shown in Figure 4, from the eyes-open to the eyes closed condition, several functional
network backbone characteristics show larger shifts in deaf as compared to hearing
participants. As indicated by the Bayes factors in Table 4, there is extreme evidence for a
larger shift (i.e. from eyes open to eyes closed condition) of the functional backbone node
strength in both alpha and beta band in deaf. Furthermore in the alpha band there was
moderate to strong evidence for a larger shift of the backbone closeness centrality median and
maximum respectively in deaf. In addition, in the beta band there was some evidence for a
larger shift in backbone closeness centrality, leaf number, diameter and kappa in deaf as
compared to controls.
Furthermore, the results showed differences among the deaf participants. Figure 5
shows a difference in functional backbone node strength between different types of deafness
(i.e. congenital, pre-lingual and post-lingual deafness), which is supported by the Bayes factor
indicating strong evidence as shown in Table 5. In addition, these Bayes factors show
moderate evidence for a difference among deaf participants in both the maximum and the
median of closeness centrality of functional network backbones.

Relation between backbone characteristics and American Sign Language
Next we investigated the effect of ASL on functional backbone characteristics, which
revealed a correlation between experience in ASL and several functional backbone metrics.
Initially, no distinction was made between deaf and hearing subjects, because hearing subjects
had relatively little ASL experience. Figure 6 shows that ASL experience is related to altered
backbone characteristics in the theta band. More specifically, an increase in ASL experience
is related to a larger backbone diameter and radius, a higher backbone eccentricity and
betweenness centrality (median), combined with a lower leaf number, kappa and hierarchy
(see Table 6 for corresponding Bayes factors). Figure 7 shows the relationship between ASL

experience and functional backbone characteristics for deaf subjects only. An increase in ASL
experience is related to a larger maximal closeness centrality in the theta-band network (see
Table 7 for corresponding Bayes factors). Furthermore, Table 6 shows strong evidence for a
correlation between mean and maximum backbone strength and ASL experience as well as
extreme evidence for a relation between closeness centrality and ASL experience in the delta
band.
Discussion
Our study employed resting-state EEG to investigate and map functional network backbone
differences between deaf and hearing people. We showed that transition from the eyes-closed
to the eyes-open condition was associated with changes in functional connectivity between
occipital and parietal cortex as well as changes in functional network backbones. These occur
especially in the alpha and beta frequency bands, in both deaf and hearing participants. This
indicates increased synchronization between auditory and visual cortical regions in response
to visual stimuli (Boytsova and Danko, 2010) or suggests topological network reorganization.

Functional cortical remapping
The ‘spontaneous’ intrinsic activity of the brain is affected by incoming stimuli, such as visual
information, which will be different in the ‘eyes open’ and ‘eyes closed’ conditions.
Moreover, the number and strength of connections also change, which is known as ‘alpha
synchronization’ and is shown to be related to the wiring cost variation between ‘eyes-open’
en ‘eyes-closed’ conditions (Gómez-Ramírez et al., 2017). However, in addition to
connectivity variation between conditions, the strong interaction effect we found between
deaf and control conditions in alpha and beta functional connectivity between occipital and
parietal cortex favors the hypothesis that in grown-up humans the neocortex possesses longterm plasticity. This cortical plasticity is known to be a multicomponent process which
involves both synaptic and cellular mechanisms (Feldman, 2009). What is interesting from

our results is that the modifications in cortical mapping occur at a relative large distance,
namely between occipital and parietal regions. This remodeling is also in line with neural
plasticity of the primary visual cortex. It has been shown in multiple studies across three
different species, such as cats and monkeys, that the location of V1 neuronal receptive fields
shifts after induction of lesions in the retina (Calford et al., 2000; Chino et al., 1995; Heinen
and Skavenski, 1991; Kaas et al., 1990). These shifts are cortically mediated given that the
thalamic input to the visual cortex shows limited reorganization (Eysel, 1982). In deaf people
it may even be the case, as suggested by our increased neuronal synchronization between
occipital and parietal recordings, that these shifts occur at a much larger scale as well.
Validation studies with experimental animal models are required to characterize the
underpinnings of this enhanced functional synchronization.

Functional backbone differences between eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions
During the eyes-open condition the functional network backbone showed a larger diameter,
higher eccentricity and a lower leaf number in the alpha and beta bands. This suggests that the
backbone topology in the eyes-open condition was more chainlike (i.e. less integration and
global efficiency), whereas during the eyes-closed condition the topology was more star-like
(i.e. more functional integration and global efficiency) (Stam et al., 2014). Visual input during
eyes-open conditions might suppress the connectivity of default-mode network activity during
eyes-closed condition (Chen et al., 2008). These results may also be explained by alpha
desynchronization, which will lead to less connections in general, indicating a ‘real change’ in
functional connectivity and not just a change in alpha activity (Gómez-Ramírez et al., 2017).
The alpha desynchronization from the eyes-open to the eyes closed condition in deaf as well
as healthy subjects is in line with previous research among healthy adults (Barry et al., 2007;
Gómez-Ramírez et al., 2017) and children (Barry et al., 2009). Two other studies reported

increased global efficiency of functional networks in the alpha band, but not in the beta band,
during the eyes-open condition as compared to the eyes-closed condition (Miraglia et al.,
2016; Tan et al., 2013), which seem to contradict our findings. These discrepancies might be
explained by demographical and methodological differences. Miraglia et al. (2016) only
included 30 healthy elderly with an average age of 65.4, while Tan and colleagues included
only 21 healthy Chinese university students, whereas our study includes 193 participants, both
teenagers and adults. Both studies used more EEG electrodes or regions of interest (i.e.
respectively 128 and 84) leading to larger networks with potential higher densities. Moreover,
these previous studies used classical graph analysis to investigate whole brain network,
whereas we have used MST analysis and studied the functional backbones of neural networks
only, which might arguably lead to slightly different results.

Larger functional network modifications in deaf
We found larger functional backbone shifts in both alpha and beta bands, from the eyes-open
to the eyes-closed condition in deaf people compared to hearing controls. These differences
between the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions may be related to the different attentional
states of the brain (i.e. internal versus external attention) (Marx et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2014;
Zhang et al., 2015). In the beta band, the shift (i.e. from a more chainlike backbone in the
eyes-open condition towards a more star-like backbone in eyes-closed condition) was more
pronounced in deaf than in healthy controls. Specifically we found a larger shift of functional
backbone node strength in deaf people from eyes-open to eyes-closed, indicating a higher
overall physiological efficacy of backbone nodes in deaf during the eyes closed condition, but
a lower overall efficacy during the eyes open condition (Hagmann et al., 2010). These effects
might be more pronounced in deaf due to cross-modal plasticity (Bavelier et al., 2006;
Bavelier and Neville, 2002; Hauser et al., 2007; Merabet and Pascual-Leone, 2010),

especially in the alpha band, which has been related to visual stimuli (Boytsova and Danko,
2010) and awareness (Putilov and Donskaya, 2014), as well as the complete lack of
audiovisual input in the eyes-closed condition.
The larger functional backbone shifts we found in deaf people, especially in the alpha band,
may therefore reflect increased awareness in eyes-open condition (i.e. they rely to a greater
extend on visual modality) and decreased awareness in eyes-closed condition. This hypothesis
is based on the deprived sensory input typically found in deaf people. Interestingly, we also
found that backbone node strength differed across the different forms of deafness and might
depend on whether people were born deaf (i.e. congenital deafness) or acquired deafness later
in life (i.e. pre-lingual or post-lingual deafness).
The lack of differences between deaf and hearing in functional backbone shifts from the eyesopen to the eyes closed condition in other frequency bands (i.e. delta, theta and gamma),
suggests that auditory deprivation does not alter functional networks as much in these
frequency bands. This might indicate that auditory deprivation leads to a strengthened
functional networks regarding situations related to sensory input (i.e. the alpha and beta
bands), rather than functional networks consisting of gamma waves. Gamma rhythms are
involved in higher processing tasks and cognitive functioning (Herrmann et al., 2010)),
whereas theta waves are involved in daydreaming, sleep and creativity. It seems therefore that
topology of functional networks in the brain (of deaf) is strongly related to conscious
achievement together with visual input, although further research is needed to investigate this
into more detail.

Relation between backbone characteristics and American Sign Language
Another interesting finding of our study is the clear relation between years of ASL experience
and functional backbone characteristics in the theta band. Increasing experience in sign

language reduced the leaf number, the maximum degree and the hierarchy of the functional
backbones, while it increased the eccentricity, diameter, median betweenness centrality and
radius of functional backbones (i.e. together indicating less integration and efficiency). This
means that the organization of functional backbones shifts toward a more chain-like or
decentralized organization with gaining ASL experience. This pattern is unlikely to be caused
by age alone as these functional network backbone patterns have different or even opposing
(e.g. leaf number, tree-hierarchy and diameter) directions in studies across the lifespan (Smit
et al., 2016). The correlation between functional backbone characteristics and years of ASL
experience is in line with previous research showing plasticity of functional and structural
network organization in the brain due to sign language (Meyer et al., 2007). However, to the
best of our knowledge there is no study that includes early-deaf teenagers and adults with sign
language experience ranging from one year up to sixteen years.

Advantages of study design and tools
Our results again show that MST graph parameters are highly suitable in exploring the
topology and connectivity of brain networks (Engels et al., 2015; Tewarie et al., 2014; van
Diessen et al., 2016), in our case related to cross modal neuroplasticity. Also our study shows
the usefulness of the portable electroencephalography device as an invaluable tool to be used
in rural or resource-limited African areas. This device enabled us to acquire an unique data-set
of recordings from deaf and hearing subjects in a country where auditory deprivation is more
prevalent than in Western countries, but where neuroimaging research is often impossible or
burdensome due to geographic conditions, poor health-care infrastructure and high levels of
poverty.

Study limitations and future directions

The downside of electroencephalography is that neural activity is measured at a few places on
the scalp and lacks information from deeper brain structures. In addition, the current data set
was limited to fourteen channels. The signals are linear combinations of the neural generators
they project to the scalp location of the electrodes. Together this means a reduction in
precision of functional network mapping. Other neuroimaging techniques, such as MRI,
might therefore be more capable to capture different activation patterns of the whole brain,
specifically in sub-cortical areas, also because functional MRI studies have shown that visual
motion stimuli caused a response in some specific auditory regions in deaf subjects (Almeida
et al., 2015; Ding et al., 2015; Karns et al., 2012; Li et al., 2015; Neville et al., 1998; Petitto,
2000; Sadato et al., 2005, 2004; Scott et al., 2014; Shiell et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2011). The
use of wireless headsets for recording EEG may have increased the noise in the EEG signal,
and affected the backbone computations. However, recent studies have shown similar
performance as standard EEG hardware (Badcock et al., 2013; David Hairston et al., 2014;
Schiatti et al., 2016), making wireless EEG recordings ideal for research in resource-poor
settings (McKenzie et al., 2017). Lastly, an additional limitation is that history taking might
be affected by a recall bias; in as much patient records (i.e. dates of births) in Nigeria are not
stored like they are in modern Western countries. This bias will have increased the noise-level
in the regression analysis.

Since both electroencephalography and the use of network backbones reduce data density (i.e.
does not take into account peripheral functional network elements), future research should
also use, or combine electroencephalography with, other neuroimaging techniques such as
functional MRI and magnetoencephalography, which allows mapping of different functional
aspects of the brain. Furthermore, in addition to the application of MST analysis, future
studies should use other network analysis techniques such as Bayesian exponential random

graph models (Caimo and Friel, 2011; Sinke et al., 2016), mixed-effect models (Simpson and
Laurienti, 2015) and Gibbs distribution models (La Rosa et al., 2016), which also enable
unbiased comparison of networks differing in size and density. This might further elucidate
the role of specific brain areas in functional backbone shifts in normal and sensory lacking
conditions, which may improve our understanding of neuroplasticity occurring after auditory
and other types of sensory deprivation.

Conclusion
We were able to detect functional network backbone differences in eyes-closed and eyes-open
conditions as well as larger shifts in some functional backbone characteristics in deaf as
compared to controls. Furthermore, differences were seen between different forms of
deafness, and our study demonstrated subtle functional network backbone changes and
differences with increasing experience of American Sign Language. Our results provide
original insights into the organization of functional brain networks derived from
electroencephalography data, both in deaf and healthy people. This might help to better
understand functional brain connectivity with lack of auditory input and the development of
sign language specifically, as well as cross-modal plasticity due to lack of sensory input in
general. Our results further underpin the notion of brain-wide neuroplastic capacities and
global network reorganization in the cortex of deaf people. The distinct reorganization
patterns between different types of deafness informs on the importance of underlying etiology
and staging of the auditory damage in the process of reorganization. The link between the
functional network backbone characteristics and acquired sign language experience reflects
ongoing brain adaptation in people with hearing disabilities.

(EEG) was acquired with wireless headsets in deaf and controls. The sensor locations
corresponding to the fourteen channels are shown in orange; the CMS/DRL sensors are shown
in blue. Two minutes within this recording were with eyes closed and two minutes with eyes
open. The order of open/closed was random. Frequency bands included delta, theta, alpha,
beta and gamma bands. Functional networks were constructed from 10-seconds epochs.
Network backbone metrics were related with years of sign language experience. Interaction
effects in the two populations and between ‘open/closed conditions’ were assessed with
