Environments are unique in terms of structural composition and evoked human
experience. Previous studies suggest that natural compared to built environments
may increase positive emotions. Humans in natural environments also demonstrate
greater performance on attention-based tasks. Few studies have investigated cortical
mechanisms underlying these phenomena or probed these differences from a neural
perspective. Using a temporally sensitive electrophysiological approach, we employ an
event-related, implicit passive viewing task to demonstrate that in humans, a greater
late positive potential (LPP) occurs with exposure to built than natural environments,
resulting in a faster return of activation to pre-stimulus baseline levels when viewing
natural environments. Our research thus provides new evidence suggesting natural
environments are perceived differently from built environments, converging with previous
behavioral findings and theoretical assumptions from environmental psychology.

INTRODUCTION
Natural environments can increase positive emotions (Roe et al., 2013) and creativity (Atchley et al.,
2012), decrease stress (Ulrich, 1984; Mayer et al., 2009; MacKerron and Mourato, 2013; Hartig
et al., 2014; Kuo, 2015; Von Lindern et al., 2017; Mennis et al., 2018), decrease impulsive decisionmaking (Berry et al., 2014; Berry et al., 2015), and are preferred over built images by adults (Kaplan
et al., 1972; Meidenbauer et al., 2019). Natural environments can also improve working memory
(Triguero-Mas et al., 2015) and attention (Hartig et al., 1991; Tennessen and Cimprich, 1995; Wells,
2000; Kuo and Faber Taylor, 2004; Berto, 2005; Berman et al., 2008; Mayer et al., 2009; Debener et al.,
2012; Hartmann et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2015; Dadvand et al., 2017; Torquati et al., 2017; Ulset et al.,
2017; Van Hedger et al., 2018; Stevenson et al., 2019).
Attention is often required when engaging in a behavior (i.e., maintaining attention to an
ongoing task). If a person continues to engage in the behavior, their perceived cost in attentional
resources is likely outweighed by the potential reward gained from continuing the behavior.
However, with time on task, a person’s likelihood of continuing the behavior decreases as attentional

2007; Berman et al., 2008; Berto et al., 2008, 2010). Fewer
studies examine how exposure to natural and built environments
correlates with brain activity. Aspinall et al. (2013) conducted
an EEG spectral analysis of how humans perceive walks through
natural environments versus walks through built environments.
Their data suggest general neural differences correlated with
natural environments versus built environments, but do not
pinpoint specific neural mechanisms. Another study reported
cortisol differences correlated with exposure to natural versus
built environments, postulating that these differences arise due
to differences in stress (Roe et al., 2013). To our knowledge,
though, no study has used the temporal sensitivity of EEG to
investigate potential electrophysiological differences correlated
with viewing images of natural versus built environments. It
is possible that temporal differences measured by EEG, via
event-related potentials (ERP’s), can help elucidate physiological
differences in humans while viewing natural versus built
environments. Employing such methodology also enables the use
of implicit measures.
In the present study, we specifically focus on the p3 and
late positive potential (LPP) ERP components. The p3 correlates
with detection of categorical differences: greater activation is
found when a rare stimulus (the ‘target,’ i.e., not a member
of a category commonly experienced within the experimental
paradigm) is shown (Sutton et al., 1965; Rozenkrants and Polich,
2008). For example, p3 amplitude correlates with detection of
changes in category of facial features (Azizian et al., 2006). Here,
we use a set of diverse stimuli to represent distinct natural versus
built environmental categories; stimuli within each category were
determined prior to our electrophysiological experiment by a
separate sample of adults who completed an explicit, binary
environmental categorization task. Then, p3 activation to these
two environmental categories was recorded while participants
passively viewed a high frequency of multiple non-target stimuli
representing one category (e.g., natural environments) and a low
frequency of target stimuli representing the opposite category
(e.g., built environments). Greater p3 amplitude for target
stimuli, regardless of stimulus category (natural vs. built), is
hypothesized. Such a finding from this passive viewing ‘oddball’
paradigm would provide electrophysiological support for implicit
categorization of environmental scenes as natural versus built.
The LPP ERP component is examined most often with respect
to stimulus valence (Bradley et al., 2007; MacNamara et al.,
2009, 2011) or perceived pleasantness (Hajcak and Olvet, 2008).
When a given stimulus (such as a building or landscape) is
perceived as pleasant or unpleasant, rather than neutral, the LPP
shows a slower recovery time to baseline levels of activation,
which can be quantified by greater positive mean amplitude than
is observed for neutral stimuli. Negative stimuli have greater
positive amplitude than pleasant stimuli, while neutral stimuli
show more baseline amplitude. Simultaneous recordings of EEG
and fMRI taken while participants viewed affective pictures have
shown LPP and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) frontal
activity to indicate contributions to perceptual categorization and
emotional processing (Liu et al., 2012).
Previous behavioral research shows that natural environments
correlate with a decrease in negative affect and are preferred

resources, which are finite, deplete. This depletion is experienced
as mental fatigue (Kaplan, 1995). The fatigability of attention
can thus be conceptualized as a cost-benefit analysis (Boksem
and Tops, 2008), and mental fatigue can be understood as the
point at which the perceived attentional costs of continuing
a behavior are greater than the potential reward gained from
continuing that behavior. Maintenance of attention to engage
in a behavior can be guided by either top-down (endogenous
and goal-driven) or bottom-up (exogenous and stimulus-driven)
processes that support cognitive control (Posner and Petersen,
1990). Interacting with natural environments, such as taking a
walk in the park, can improve performance on tasks designed
to measure these systems of attention, especially endogenous
attention (Ohly et al., 2016). Fewer cognitive resources may
be needed to reach the same level of attentional performance
when tested outdoors vs. indoors (Debener et al., 2012; Torquati
et al., 2017). Such evidence suggests that interactions between
attention and environment play a role in behavioral performance,
specifically with respect to the onset of mental fatigue. Yet,
there is little research to explain underlying mechanisms or
physiological correlates of this relationship (Berman et al.,
2019). It is important to understand biological underpinnings
to this potentially transformative, yet low-cost and noninvasive, avenue for bolstering mental health and well being
(Schertz and Berman, 2019).
Attention Restoration Theory (ART; Kaplan, 1989) largely
drives this research. ART posits that certain environments better
replenish attentional resources from a depleted state, based on
five psycho-environmental characteristics: fascination, extent,
coherence, being away, and compatibility. Fascination is an
environment’s ability to capture exogenous attention. Extent is
the degree to which the environment is of large enough scope to
keep exogenous attention engaged for more than a brief moment.
Coherence, as defined within ART, is the degree to which
the scene makes sense as a whole. Being away represents the
conceptual removal of the potentially restorative environment
from the fatiguing environment. Finally, compatibility represents
characteristics of the potentially restorative environment that
would facilitate a person’s goals for restoration. Thus, the first
three characteristics are responsible for an environment’s ability
to capture and hold exogenous attention, whereas the last two
conceptually distinguish environments in which mental fatigue
occurs (being away) and align with a person’s restorative goals
(compatibility; Kaplan, 1989, 1995; Kaplan and Berman, 2010).
The theory posits that when finite resources for endogenous
attention are depleted, the cognitive mechanisms for inhibiting
distractions suffer. In this state of mental fatigue, environments
that easily engage exogenous attention effectively allow these
inhibitory mechanisms to rest and attentional resources to
replenish; this is defined as attention restoration (Kaplan, 1989).
Previous research has shown natural environments, when rated
along these five characteristics, to be more restorative than built
environments (Berto, 2005, 2007; Berman et al., 2008; Lee et al.,
2015).
Studies driven by this theory concerning human responses
to natural and built environments have primarily examined
behavioral responses (e.g., Kaplan, 1989, 1995; Berto, 2005,

over built environments (Kahn and Kellert, 2002; Berto, 2005,
2007; Berto et al., 2008, 2010; Falk and Balling, 2010; Aspinall
et al., 2013). Previous data from EEG spectral analyses also
suggest that natural environments hold greater positive valence
than built environments (Aspinall et al., 2013; Roe et al.,
2013), but LPP was not measured in these studies. We ask in
the current study using the passive oddball viewing paradigm
whether natural environments not only correlate with behavioral
responses indicating preference, but also electrophysiological
evidence in the form of LPP differences as well.
In sum, the current study employs a passive viewing oddball
task in which stimuli from each of two environmental categories
occur, with one category appearing at a high frequency and
the other appearing at a low frequency. We examine the p3
and LPP ERP components correlated with viewing the stimuli.
Hypotheses for this study are twofold: first, if natural versus
built environments are implicitly perceived as being from distinct
visual categories, a greater p3 should occur after viewing a target.
Second, if natural environments are perceived as more pleasant
than built environments, there may be a faster LPP recovery
time after viewing non-target blocks of natural environments
than after viewing non-target blocks of built environments.
Either such result would identify electrophysiological markers
signifying that humans implicitly categorize environments along
dimensions of naturalness and/or pleasantness, and move closer
to elucidating potential mechanisms and neural correlates
underlying benefits of human exposure to natural environments.

Naturalness categorization
Four hundred and eighteen scenic images were crowd-sourced
via lab Facebook page and lab contacts. Instructions for
submission of photos were as follows:
“The Multisensory Cognition Lab at USU is running a
study on environmental perception, and is looking for
participants to contribute stimuli to this study. If you would
like to contribute some of your own photos, please send
us your best photographs of different types of scenes –
we are particularly looking for photos of a wide variety of
natural settings and separate photos of manmade settings.
Photos should be in color and should not contain people.
They should not be easily recognizable landmarks that are
commonly known to the general population. If we choose
to use your photos in our experiment, they will first be
rated by some of our participants and will then be viewed
by other participants while they complete various cognitive
tasks. They will not know you took the photos. You will
not receive any compensation for or feedback about your
photos. Please email childcognitioncenter@gmail.com with
up to 10 photos if you would like to participate. Thanks!”

MATERIALS AND METHODS

To determine categories of natural vs. built indicated by
explicit behavioral choice, participants in the categorization
sample were asked to categorize each of the 418 images as
“natural” or “built” by placing their index fingers on the “q”
and “p” keys on a standard keyboard and pressing “q” for
“natural” and “p” for “built.” The images were presented on a
1900 LCD monitor (aspect ratio 4:3) in randomized order across
participants, in a self-paced task, via Eprime. Images rated as
“natural” by 60% of these participants or more were considered
“natural” stimuli, and those categorized as “natural” by 40% or
less were considered “built” stimuli. This resulted in 227 natural
and 162 built images submitted.

Participants
All participants signed IRB-approved consent forms.
Students who participated received course credit toward
their undergraduate psychology course work.

Categorization Sample
Fifty-one adults (21 Females; 18–38 years old; M = 23.58 years
old) participated in a binary stimulus categorization task.
Participants provided their gender, handedness, and age.

Rating Sample

Perceived restorativeness ratings

Thirty-seven adults (21 Females, 1 unreported; 18–32 years old;
M = 21.22 years old), different from those in the categorization
sample, rated scenic images on an adapted version of the
Perceived Restorative Scale (PRS) called the PRS short version
(Berto, 2005; for original see Korpela and Hartig, 1996) and
a preference item, which will be described below. Participants
provided their gender, handedness, and age.

The 418 images were randomly assigned to 8 subsets of images
so that sets were a manageable size to be rated in one sitting by
participants. Each subset was rated by 6–9 participants on the
PRS-short items. This rating procedure and sample sizes of the
rating groups were designed to be consistent with that of Berto
(2005). Images within a subset were presented in randomized
order across participants. Participants were instructed to view
each image, read each statement carefully, and assess whether
the statement applied to how they would experience the place
depicted in the image. Images remained on the screen while the
participants recorded their responses on a response sheet; this
involved an 11-point (0–10) rating scale beside each statement,
through which they would select from ‘0’ indicating ‘not at all’
to 10 indicating ‘very much.’ After answering all items for one

ERP Sample
Seventy-four right-handed adults (30 Females; 18–40 years old;
M = 21.8 years old), different from those in each of the

categorization and rating tasks. Handedness was measured using
the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory - Short Form (Veale, 2014).

viewed the natural-non-target block, in which 80 natural and
20 built images were presented in random order. In the builtnon-target block, image category frequencies were reversed. For
each participant, the experimental software was programmed to
select images randomly for non-target and target roles in the
respective blocks from all images in the “nature” and “built”
categories as determined by the results of the categorization task
described above. Thus, two participants would not necessarily
see all of the same images by the end of the experiment. The

order. Images were shown for 1,000 ms followed by a 500 ms

image, the participant pressed the spacebar to proceed to the
next. The average restorativeness score across participants for
each image was calculated.
One further item of scene “preference” was included to be
rated on the same 11-point (0–10) Likert scale as the PRSshort. The preference item, “The scene depicted is a place in
which I would like to live,” was adapted from Falk and Balling’s
(2010) investigation of landscape preference. See Figure 1
for the PRS short version including the additional preference
item by Falk and Balling (2010).

EEG Data Acquisition
The EEG data were acquired using the EEG Emotiv headset and
TestBench software with 14 channels (AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7,
O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, and AF4) using Common Mode
Sense active electrode and Driven Right leg passive electrode
(CMS/DRL) references at P3/P4; left/right mastoid process
alternative. Samples were collected at a rate of 128 per second
(2,048 Hz internal) and scalp impedance were below 10 k at
recording onset. Data were preprocessed in EEGLab (Delorme
and Makeig, 2004). Data were filtered (bandpass: 0.1–59 Hz),
re-referenced to average scalp reference, and trials containing
artifacts were removed algorithmically based on abnormal trend
and improbable data (Delorme and Makeig, 2004). Independent
component analysis was used to reject stereotypical eye blinking
and jaw-related muscle clenching. Each trial length spanned
1,200 ms, where the first 200 ms served as baseline for the
1,000 ms post-event epoch.

ERP Analysis
For all ERP analysis the grand mean was taken across standard
and target epochs. The p3 analysis window was defined as
200–400 ms (Rozenkrants and Polich, 2008). P300 amplitude
was measured at AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8,
FC6, F4, F8, and AF4 from base to peak. P3 was calculated
by taking the percent change of the p3 window relative to
the ISI. This was then aggregated to calculate the grand
means across channels. Mean peak amplitudes were used to
derive the p3 across all participants for each condition. A 3way repeated measures ANOVA for Environment (natural and
built) × Stimulus (target and non-target) × Channel (14
channels) was conducted on p3 mean amplitude. A planned
comparison excluding the Stimulus factor was also conducted
in order to further isolate effects specific to Environment in
the different Stimulus conditions. The LPP was defined as the
mean amplitude at 550–930 ms after the target stimulus was
presented (MacNamara et al., 2011). An initial 3-way repeated
measures ANOVA (rmANOVA) for Environment (natural and
built) × Stimulus (target and non-target) × Channel (14
channels) was also conducted on LPP mean amplitude. Achieved
power (1 − β) was 1.00. Statistical analyses were performed
in JASP (JASP Team, 2016). Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
methods were used for group level comparisons. To correct

Passive Oddball Viewing Task Procedure
Participants were seated in a chair 24 inches from the monitor.
The experimenter placed the EEG cap on the participant’s head
and ensured that all electrode sites showed an impedance of
less than 10 k before starting data recording. Participants
completed a passive oddball task with instructions as follows:
“You will be seeing a series of pictures. View the images as they
appear.” After the instructions, the EEG headset was equipped
for recording from participants. Participants were shown two
blocks consisting of various images. Half of the participants first

ANOVA comparisons.

A significant difference for preference between natural
(M = 5.48, SD = 1.72) and built (M = 4.74, SD = 2.03)
images was also revealed [t(309.599) = 3.755, p < 0.001,
d = 0.43]. The assumption of equal variances was also not
met for this comparison, with built images having significantly
greater variance in preference than natural images (F-max = 1.39,
p < 0.05), so the adjusted statistics are reported above.

Behavioral Results: Restorativeness
Ratings and Categorical Preferences

ERP Results

Perceived restorativeness averages of the two environmental
categories were compared using an independent samples t-test.
The natural images (M = 6.48, SD = 0.94) were rated as
more restorative than the built images [M = 5.64, SD = 1.12;
t(307.675) = 7.732, p < 0.001, d = 0.88]. Natural images were
expectedly rated higher on fascination [t(312.204) = 8.599,
p < 0.001, d = 0.97], being away [t(305.266) = 10.844,
p < 0.001, d = 1.24], extent [t(316.204) = 16.863, p < 0.001,
d = 1.89], and compatibility [t(304.169) = 8.637, p < 0.001,
d = 0.99]. Notably, natural images were unexpectedly rated
lower than built on coherence [t(306.882) = −15.634, p < 0.001,
d = 1.78]. The assumption of equal variances was not met for the
comparisons of overall restorativeness, being away, fascination,
extent, and compatibility. Thus, test statistics accounting for
this violation have been reported; however, this assumption was
met for the coherence comparison, and values for that test are
thus unadjusted. For descriptive statistics by category for each
restorativeness subcomponent, see Table 1.

p3 Results
After conducting the analysis along p3 mean amplitude,
we found no significant interaction effects between
Environment × Stimulus × Channel. A significant main
effect for Channel was found [F(2.462,145.25) = 162.37;
p < 0.001; η2p = 0.733, 1−β = 0.99], but no significant differences
were found for Environment or Stimulus. A planned comparison
excluding the Stimulus factor was also conducted in order to
further isolate effects specific to Environment in the different
Stimulus conditions, but no effect of Environment was found.
Thus, no oddball effect of the 80/20% categorical frequency
presentation scheme on attentional resources was shown. We
failed to see a significant oddball effect for p3 [F(1,59) = 0.135;
p = 0.715].

LPP Results
A significant main effect for Channel along LPP mean amplitude
was revealed [F(1.97,116.25) = 50.845; p < 0.001; η2p = 0.463]
as well as a significant interaction for Environment × Channel
[F(4.36,257.34) = 4.36, p < 0.01, η2p = 0.07], which indicated
a difference in polarity between frontal channels and posterior
channels (Figures 3, 4). Two separate 3-way rmANOVA
were conducted on these two areas to compensate for
polarity differences, and p-values were subsequently Bonferroni
corrected. In frontal channels, a significant main effect for
Environment was found [F(1,59) = 11.12; p < 0.005; η2p = 0.16],
indicating a greater LPP mean amplitude for built environments
than natural environments [t(59) = 3.34; p < 0.005]. A Bayesian
rmANOVA was also conducted, indicating strong support in
favor of built environments eliciting greater LPP activity than
natural environments (BF10 = 28.08; posterior probability:
96.56%; Figure 5). In posterior channels, a significant main effect
for Environment was also found [F(1,59) = 11.12; p < 0.005;
η2p = 0.16], indicating a greater LPP mean amplitude for
built environments than natural environments [t(59) = 3.34;
p < 0.005]. A Bayesian rmANOVA was also conducted,

Aspinall et al., 2013), it is suspected that the greater perceived
restorative potential of the nature images used in this study
underlies participants’ demonstrated greater implicit preference
for them. Further, some research has begun to explore the basic
visual characteristics of natural scenery that may underlie the
cognitive and emotional benefits of this scenery. For example,
similar to Aspinall et al. (2013) findings of greater alpha wave
activity when viewing natural scenery, Hägerhäll et al. (2015)
found that viewing statistical fractals – the type of repeating
visual patterns characteristic of natural scenery – correlated with
greater alpha wave activity compared to exact fractal patterns –
those characteristic of human architecture. As alpha activity
is associated with a wakeful relaxed state and attentiveness, it
may be that the same visual characteristics facilitating attention
restoration may implicitly cue scene category.
Convergent, implicit electrophysiological evidence of this
association derives from the lesser LPP activation found while
viewing greater frequencies of natural compared with built
images. In previous research, lesser LPP amplitude for valent
stimuli has been indicative of greater perceived pleasantness
(Hajcak and Nieuwenhuis, 2006; Hajcak and Olvet, 2008;
MacNamara et al., 2011) as well as implicit and explicit
categorization processes (Ito and Cacioppo, 2000). Since viewing
natural scenes correlated with lesser LPP amplitude when
compared to built scenes in the current study, it is plausible that
natural scenes are more emotionally valent, and particularly more
pleasant, than built scenes, even when viewed passively with no
explicit instructions for categorization.
Late positive potential differences in response to viewing
natural versus built stimuli were more apparent over frontal
sensor sites than parietal or occipital sites (which showed
significance, but with weaker consistency as determined by
Bayesian analyses). Liu et al. (2012) LPP-BOLD coupling revealed
between-category (pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant) differences
in LPP amplitude, BOLD activity, and recruited neural substrates.
These substrates’ level of contribution to LPP modulation was
also valence-specific. In the context of previous findings, we
take the significant difference in LPP amplitude to indicate
potential differences in perceived valence between natural and
built scenes. However, LPP’s being evoked by mere arousal, rather
than also being moderated by valence, is debated, as cognitive
neuroscientific conclusions are inherently prone to reverse
inference (e.g., Hajcak and Nieuwenhuis, 2006; Poldrack, 2011).
In fact, research has shown the effects of arousal and valence
on LPP to be difficult to tease apart, though some differences
in return to baseline have been found between high-arousing
unpleasant images and pleasant images (O’hare et al., 2017).
A recent review by Hajcak and Foti (2020) concluded that even
more so than arousal, LPP may likely be modulated specifically
by motivational significance. This significance is that which
facilitates approach and avoidance responses to stimuli, whether
task relevant or not. Thus, it is plausible that the LPP from
the current EEG sample correlates with such responses to both
natural and built stimuli. Further, Gable and Adams (2013) found
that paradigms with a long stimulus duration (e.g., 1,000 ms)
elicit a more protracted p3, similar to the LPP elicited in an
emotional viewing task, while oddball paradigms with a short

indicating support for built environments eliciting greater LPP
activity than natural environments (BF10 = 2.32; posterior
probability: 69.88%).

DISCUSSION
This study was designed to investigate, with ERP methodology
and a passive oddball paradigm, whether viewing natural versus
built environments correlates with distinct electrophysiological
patterns. Unlike previous, primarily behavioral investigations,
this study utilized temporally sensitive electrophysiological
measures to examine potential differences in neural responses
while viewing natural versus built environments. Our findings
indicate lesser LPP amplitude and faster LPP recovery time when
the non-target stimuli were those of natural environments versus
built environments. Data suggest that participants perceived
natural scenes as more pleasant than built scenes. Results also
suggest that, in addition to explicit behavioral categorization,
there may be an implicit categorization of natural and built
environments that can be revealed through distinct physiological
signatures. The current results leave open the question of whether
stimuli were implicitly categorized as a function of naturalness,
restorativeness, or both. Future studies should experimentally
distinguish between these stimulus constructs.
Subjective ratings revealed greater perceived restorative
potential for natural images than for built images. This finding
is consistent with previous empirical studies of environmental
imagery (Berto, 2005; Berman et al., 2008). While we did not
collect self-report ratings of image emotional valence, we did
find that preference was greater for natural environments than
built. This suggests more positive association with natural images
compared to built images when behavioral preference is explicitly
measured. Given that previous research has found restorative
environments to also be more explicitly preferred (Berto, 2005;

task, in which participants received instructions to specifically
search for, and respond to, various exemplars of the low
frequency target category, using the current stimuli, may have
shown p3 differences, and thus an oddball effect—though this
remains to be tested. In combination with the passive nature
of the task, another limiting factor with respect to examining
the p3 may have been within-category stimulus diversity: the
large number of unique images within each category. The p3
component is traditionally studied using one exemplar of a
category in each of the target and non-target roles (Polich,
2003; Rozenkrants and Polich, 2008). A design incorporating
within-category stimulus homogeneity may more directly elicit
a p3 component. Another limitation is that, given our stimulus
categorization thresholds (>60% = natural, <40% = built), the
lack of a significant p3 finding could also be due to the inclusion
of environmentally heterogeneous images. For example, a
natural image that was categorized as “natural” by 61% of the
categorization sample may still contain a substantial number
of built environment features. Operationalizing the natural
and built categories at the chosen thresholds was necessary,
though, to ensure sufficiently large stimulus sets in the current
study. Furthermore, within-environment stimulus diversity was
necessary in order to draw category-level conclusions for
environment. Previous behavioral studies of natural versus built
environments have also employed diverse stimulus sets (Berto,
2005; Berman et al., 2008; Roe et al., 2013; Pasini et al.,
2014), prompting the neural comparison design reported herein.
Questions concerning potential methodological limitations,
however, should be addressed in future research.

stimulus duration (e.g., 200 ms) elicited a more typical p3. That
stimuli in the current study were displayed for 1,000 ms, but the
p3 analysis window was restricted to 200–400 ms, could explain
the lack of p3 differences found between conditions.
This lack of a significant oddball effect in the current
study, though surprising, may also be due to the use of a
passive task. Given that the standard and target images were
determined at the category level, perhaps an active oddball

Future Directions
The current results leave open the question of whether
stimuli were implicitly categorized as a function of naturalness,
restorativeness, both, or possible correlating low-level visual
features (Kotabe et al., 2017); the variables correlate in the

current design. Natural stimuli within this study were rated
higher in four of the five components of ART, indicating
natural environments in this study to be more restorative than
built environments. Since the design of this study relies on
a passive task measuring implicit categorization, it is possible
that components of ART requiring greater implicit (bottomup) processing are most critical in determining categorical
differences in restoration. An example of one such component
could be fascination, or how an environment captures exogenous
attention. In the current study, though, we cannot separate out
the different components of ART for each given stimulus in
order to accurately assess whether the differences are truly due
to restoration as opposed to the ‘naturalness’ of environmental
categories (e.g., Scopelliti et al., 2019). Image statistics and
the time course of visually processing natural vs. non-natural
scenes may also drive the implicit categorization of these two
environment types. The fractal structure in natural scenes may be
more quickly and easily processed than the straighter structure
in man-made scenes, and contextual cues to category may
derive from quickly established global action (affordance) or
function related properties of environments—rather than merely
segmented, local objects and parts (e.g., Torralba and Oliva,
2003; Green and Hummel, 2004; Greene and Oliva, 2006, 2009;
Oliva and Torralba, 2006, 2007). Future research should further
measure and characterize the statistical properties in scenes to
help elucidate mechanisms underlying the current findings (e.g.,
Geisler, 2008). Future research should also further address neural
correlates with natural versus built environments using stimuli
presented in modalities other than vision. Previous studies
suggest that organisms may judge soundscape environments as
pleasant based on perceived indicators of safety – though in
contrast to the visual processing discussed above, this type of
auditory processing is subcortical (e.g., Andringa and Lanser,
2013; van den Bosch et al., 2018). It would be interesting if
across modality, findings converged to show that organisms more
rapidly and easily categorize natural environments as safe and
therefore also as more pleasant.
Although participant ratings of the stimuli used in this study
revealed natural scenes to be more restorative overall than
built scenes, natural scenes were surprisingly lower than built
scenes along the ‘coherence’ component. To clarify this result,
replications using these stimuli should collect negative- and
positive-specific valence ratings. Also, further ratings using the
PRS-short should be collected to ensure that the direction of
the coherence difference reported herein is not spurious. It is
also possible that ‘coherence’ was interpreted by participants
differently than it has been defined within ART; perhaps, for
example, participants rated coherence lower in natural scenes

since unlike built environments, they are not designed for some
human-driven purpose. Finally, future research should explore
correlations between specific ART components and positive and
negative valence, as well as performance on directed attention
tasks. It may be that some ART components - expectedly,
being away and compatibility – may contribute more to positive
valence of a scene while others, such as fascination, extent,
and coherence, are more strongly related to replenishment of
attentional resources as suggested by previous ART research.
Although the work presented here is only an initial exploration,
understanding the role of positive experience within attention
restoration—including from a neural perspective – is a ripe area
for future investigation. A neural methodological perspective will
help us understand more completely the various health benefits
humans can accrue from exposure to natural environments.
