Objective: The most important part of signal processing for classification is feature extraction
as a mapping from original input electroencephalographic (EEG) data space to new features
space with the biggest class separability value. Features are not only the most important, but
also the most difficult task from the classification process as they define input data and classification quality. An ideal set of features would make the classification problem trivial. This
article presents novel methods of feature extraction processing and automatic epilepsy seizure
classification combining machine learning methods with genetic evolution algorithms.
Methods: Classification is performed on EEG data that represent electric brain activity. At
first, the signal is preprocessed with digital filtration and adaptive segmentation using fractal
dimensions as the only segmentation measure. In the next step, a novel method using genetic
programming (GP) combined with support vector machine (SVM) confusion matrix as fitness
function weight is used to extract feature vectors compressed into lower dimension space and
classify the final result into ictal or interictal epochs.
Results: The final application of GP–SVM method improves the discriminatory performance of
a classifier by reducing feature dimensionality at the same time. Members of the GP tree structure
represent the features themselves and their number is automatically decided by the compression
function introduced in this paper. This novel method improves the overall performance of the
SVM classification by dramatically reducing the size of input feature vector.
Conclusion: According to results, the accuracy of this algorithm is very high and comparable, or
even superior to other automatic detection algorithms. In combination with the great efficiency,
this algorithm can be used in real-time epilepsy detection applications. From the results of the
algorithm’s classification, we can observe high sensitivity, specificity results, except for the
Generalized Tonic Clonic Seizure (GTCS). As the next step, the optimization of the compression stage and final SVM evaluation stage is in place. More data need to be obtained on GTCS
to improve the overall classification score for GTCS.
Keywords: genetic programming, adaptive segmentation, SVM, fractal dimensions, EEG

Epilepsy is a form of neurological disorder manifested by seizures, which are not
linked to direct causes such as head injury or drug abuse. Epilepsy seizure is caused
by a sudden electrical discharge in the brain, which may be a result of exogenous
stimuli in case of reflex seizures or endogenous stimuli caused by chemical imbalance.
About 1%–2% of the world population suffers from epilepsy.1 Also, 25%–30% of this
group cannot be treated surgically or by drugs.2 These people suffer from so-called
“refractory epilepsy”, and devices and methods for automatic epilepsy detection are

of great importance to them and for their quality of life.3 The
most severe consequence of the epilepsy disease is sudden
unexpected death in epilepsy.3
Electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing for final
ictal, interictal activity is divided into the following steps:
1. Low pass signal filtration
2. Adaptive segmentation based on fractal dimension
3. Feature extraction and compression based on genetic
programming (GP)–support vector machine (SVM)
algorithm
4. Final stage SVM classification.
The most important part of signal processing for classification is feature extraction. Feature extraction is mapping
from original input EEG data space to new features space
with the biggest class separability value. Separation problem cannot be properly solved unless provided with proper
features and their relationship consideration. Scientists also
came to agreement that features are not only most important
but also a most difficult task from the classification process.
An ideal set of features would make the classification problem trivial.
In this paper, we introduce a novel method for EEG signal
classification based on the methods of GP in combination with
SVM confusion matrix, as the GP fitness function weighs for
the tree structure individual quality, which represents the
feature itself. Number of features is determined automatically
by the novel function for the best feature selection. This part
of an algorithm covers feature extraction and compression
with the best feature selection in one stage. Reduced feature
vector dimensionality also improves the performance of final
SVM classification. This novel method is tested and proven
to be more successful and effective for automatic epilepsy
detection than most of the currently presented methods.
Approximately 1/100 of people suffer from a seizure attack
once in their lifetime. The occurrence of an epileptic seizure is
unpredictable and its cause is understood very little. The EEG
signal which is used to present and test this novel algorithm
is a signal obtained from the number of (usually 128, 34, 32,
19, 14) electrodes placed on a scalp. This signal contains the
sum of electric activity produced by millions of neurons. This
signal contains not only a lot of valuable information but also
great amount of noise and useless information. Detection of
ictal activity is very important in diagnosis and therapy.4
Visual analysis of the long-term EEG recording by the
neurologist is very time consuming, and development of an
automatic epilepsy detection algorithm had been analyzed
in a number of studies.

Materials and methods
Automated epilepsy detection
Since the beginning of automated epilepsy detection, this
field had developed in two main directions:
1. Interictal spike detection or epilepsy spike detection and
2. Epileptic seizure analysis.
This paper presents method from the group of automated
spike detection based on methods of GP combined with SVM
confusion matrix.

GP
GP method was developed for finding the approximate or
exact problem solution by Koza.5 GP method is based on
an individual evolution in the population tree, where every
individual represents certain solution to the problem. GP
method looks for the best solution using Darwin’s evolution
theory, where the original line of individuals (generation) is
changed and selected by means of mutation, crossover, and
natural selection.
Methods of GP were already used to improve k-nearest
neighbors classification method performance, where a decision
tree was declared for every feature, which was the function of
the feature itself.6 Methods based on GP were also used in image
processing to classify specific images.7 Another application
found its place in the new feature vector extraction that improved
the overall performance of the kNN classification method.8 GPbased methods were also used in optimal feature vector search
that improved the classification algorithm efficiency.9
The method introduced in this article creates new synthetic set of features instead of searching for the best feature
set as in the abovementioned articles.

Problem definition
The method introduced here is being developed as a part of
the complex system for environmental reflex seizure stimuli
localization using a series of sensor fusion and complex analysis methods. This complex system is a part of the dissertation
thesis “Biometrical data processing and analysis – exogenous
epilepsy seizure source localization and classification”.10,11
Main motivation of this thesis and its part described in this
paper is to improve the quality of life of people suffering
from seizures and initiate development in areas of automatic
exogenous stimuli detection and localization which had been
overlooked by both scientists and doctors, and current research
state in this field is far beyond its current possibilities.
There is a clear link between environmental stimulants
and reflex seizures as described by researchers, but there is

also an expressed unsatisfactory state of current research in
this area.12,13 The developed algorithm criteria were efficient in
terms of low computational cost and high classification accuracy. All the above-described issues were important to improve
the current research state in the area of automatic seizure detection in environmental stimuli localization application.
Current automatic seizure detection approaches are trading computational cost for high accuracy.14 Highly accurate
methods come with high computational cost, and highly
efficient methods used, for instance, in Brain Computer Interface come with results of lower accuracy.15 This study uses
linear machine learning method, SVM, in combination with
GP to introduce an efficient method with high classification
accuracy in automatic epilepsy detection.
Details of specific signal preprocessing, basic feature
set extraction, and implementation of this newly purposed
GP–SVM algorithm are described in the “Automatic EEG
signal segmentation using fractal dimension measure” and
“Automatic epilepsy classification GP–SVM method” sections. Tests on sample of specifically selected 42 test subjects
and final evaluation of this algorithm are described in the
“Testing” and “Results and discussion” sections, respectively.
The final conclusion and future work are described in the
“Conclusion” and “Future work” sections, respectively.

Automatic EEG signal segmentation
using fractal dimension measure
Before the EEG signal can be analyzed, it needs to be separated into time fragments called epochs. Because this algorithm is analyzing and searching for epileptic (ictal) activity,
it is effective to use such measure for adaptive segmentation
algorithm, which performs the best in separating ictal and
interictal signal.

State of the art
The frequency and amplitude of EEG signal are highly variable.
This is given by the nature of the biological signal source itself.
The final EEG signal contains, besides useful information,
lots of biological noise (electrocardiography [ECG], electromyography, electrooculography) and artificial environmental
noise (electromagnetic disturbances). For further processing,
it is necessary to separate the signal into time segments called
epochs. There are two types of segmentations: constant with
the constant time fragment length and adaptive with variable
time fragment length changing according to the nature of the
signal. Constant segmentation is not described any further as
results of this old technique are not satisfactory.

Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment 2018:14

Automatic epilepsy detection

Adaptive segmentation looks for transient states in the
signal. Signal transition in the case of epileptic EEG data is
transition from interictal to ictal state.
Adaptive segmentation algorithm was first presented in
1986 by Silin and Skrylev using two sliding Fast Fourier
transform (FFT) windows. The algorithm was based on difference in the sliding window values. New segment is detected if
the difference crosses a certain threshold. This basic method
was not very effective, thanks to the non-stationary nature of
the EEG signal. This algorithm was later on updated by Varri
who used differences in signal amplitude summations in two
sliding windows.15 This algorithm became the basic algorithm
for all other adaptive segmentations. There is a whole series of
adaptive segmentation algorithms, namely, linear prediction
method, autocorrelation method, FFT, fuzzy c-means, and
fractal dimensions. Linear prediction and autocorrelation methods do not support multichannel segmentation that is required.
FFT and two-window method is not suitable for highly nonstationary epileptic signal, and fuzzy c-means method has a
high computational cost. Adaptive segmentation based on
fractal dimensions uses only this feature to separate the signal
into segments and its calculation is fast and effective.
Fractal dimension is a statistical index of signal complexity given by signal detail change to size change.16 In EEG
signal processing, the fractal dimension feature expresses
signal’s non-stationary value.
Signal’s fractal dimension is calculated using Katz’s
algorithm. When the fractal dimension value thus EEG signal
complexity crosses a certain threshold (0.4) calculated from
series of heuristically performed experiments the new signal
segment is detected.17
The fractal dimension is calculated using Equation 1,
L
where n = , L … is the total length of the curve calculated
d
as an Euclidian distance between samples and d … is the
curve diameter defined as the maximum distance of the first
sample with any other signal sample

D=

log10 ( L)
log10 ( d )

=

log( n)
 d
log( n) log  
 L

The adaptive segmentation value is then calculated
according to Varri using the following equation:15
G j = D j +1 − D j

Basic feature set

M

The first step described in the “Automatic feature extraction and compression” section is the basic feature set
extraction using DWT. This transformation is used due to
the fact that the EEG signal has a non-stationary character. Discrete form of wavelet transform uses quadrature
mirrored set of finite impulse response filters where the
low-pass filter’s output represents input signal approximation and high-pass filter’s output represents input signal
detail components.
Every decomposed signal using DWT represents
specific time frequency spectrum. A set of six features is
extracted for every such decomposed information. These
features are selected from area of time, statistical analysis, and information theory to extract the most important
characteristics of the EEG signal. These features are
as follows:
• Signal average value, which is represented by the signal’s
amplitude average value (Equation 3).

Synthetic feature extraction and
compression
The second stage of the presented algorithm is using combined methods of GP and machine learning SVM method.
Every individual in a genetic tree represents a new set of
features, which is created by nonlinear transformation of the
previous individual. These new features are put into SVM
classifier that expresses the features of individual quality via
its error function ξ, which is a part of the confusion matrix
expressing the quality of classification using 10-fold crossvalidation testing.18
In standard GP-based methods, one individual in a genetic
tree expresses one result and in the end of the tree evolution,
only one feature vector (result) is obtained. In this paper, we
present a method that includes the F function in every genetic
population tree which expresses the new feature vector. The
F function has only one argument and one output which is a
copy of the function input. The output value of function F is
taken as one of the final synthetic feature vectors. Number
of feature vectors and, thus, the compression level is defined
by the number of F functions.
An example of such an F function is given in Figure 3.
This population tree is fed with an input of ten values x1 ... x10
and given two F functions (nodes) that form the new feature
expressed as a combination of the population descendants.
This algorithm uses the result of the F functions and not
the result of the whole population tree evolution. The best
descendant is given by the best basic arithmetic operation
combination which is found by the maximum fitness value
or minimum SVM error function value given by confusion
matrix. Two new feature vectors will be created as shown
in the picture: the first feature vector will be expressed as
multiplication of input basic features x5x9 and the second
feature vector will be expressed as summation of x3+x8.

SVM confusion matrix and GP fitness
function
Most important part of the algorithm is the population
member fitness evaluation. The value of this function is
given by the misclassification value of the SVM classifier
given by the confusion matrix obtained by the 10-fold crossvalidation. The process of the fitness function evaluation

2. Evaluation of the population tree, best member selection,
and new features extraction.
3. Trained SVM classifier classifies the validation data.
Important value in this step is the value of the misclassified labels given by the confusion matrix. ξi = Nv - Ns,
where Nv represents the total number of validation samples
and Ns gives the number of correctly classified samples.
4. Steps 1–4 are repeated for every population member in
search for the ones with the maximum fitness function
value (minimum ξi value).

the GP. Thirty-six patients (85% of the group) were previously suffering from tonic–clonic episodes, of which 10
(24% of the group) were unwitnessed and not medically
assessed and 26 patients (62% of the group) were medically
diagnosed or EEG recordings were labeled to contain tonic–
clonic seizure.

Clinical diagnosis
This section and Table 1 describe the clinical diagnosis of partial, generalized, and unclassified epilepsy types of patients.
These data are based solely on the neurologist’s evaluation
provided either by the patient himself or by the neurologist
upon patient’s agreement. A total of 12 patients (29%) were
classified with generalized epilepsy, 23 (54%) with partial
epilepsy, and 7 patients (17%) were unclassified.

Testing
This section presents the results of the classification algorithm described in previous sections. Data were obtained
in children from the neurological department of university
Hospital Ostrava-Poruba and clients of Trigon association
that provides support for people with social disabilities.
The patient whose results are shown in this section was
diagnosed with photosensitive epilepsy, more specifically
Jeavons syndrome.19 Data from this patient were fully classified and described by the neurologist. EEG signal record was
fully labeled by the neurologist as well. These data contained

Extraction of the basic feature vector
The basic features set is created by input signal decomposition using four-level DWT. Daubechies wavelet is used as
the mother wavelet. Number of levels and type of mother
wavelet were determined to be the best possible to discover
most details and separate the EEG signal most appropriately
according to its spectral composition.19 Wavelet filter bank
frequency bands are specified for the sampling frequency of
128 Hz in Table 2.
Figure 5 shows the four-level wavelet decomposed signals for seizure-free signal. Figure 6 shows the EEG signal
decomposition with myoclonic seizure.
Basic set of six features is calculated for every decomposed frequency sub-band according to features described in
the “Basic feature set” section. Table 3 describes the input
feature vector mapping with respect to decomposed sub-band
and calculated feature.

Feature vector combination
Figure 7 shows results of SVM training phase defining
hyperplane separating classified and non-classified samples
using exponential radial basis function as defined in 10.
Training samples of the population tree descendants combining the input features x9+x10 are clearly distinguishable
from the population member genetically combining the input
features x17+x18, and thus, these two members are suitable
for the new features.
These two members were found using fitness function value obtained from the confusion matrix, which is
the output of the SVM classifier expressing classification
quality.
An example of such confusion matrix can be observed in
Figure 8. Elements of this matrix are used to express the quality of the classifier output. Diagonal elements represent the
number of points correctly classified (predicted label = target
true label) and off-diagonal elements express mislabeled

Results and discussion
Algorithm described in the “Automatic epilepsy classification GP–SVM method” section was tested on the dataset
obtained from 42 subjects with 1–3 tests on each subject
measured primarily over the night. Origin of the dataset is
closely described in the “Data” section.
Algorithm results were evaluated using the following:
1. 10-fold cross validation technique X10.
2. Statistical success rate evaluation of sensitivity XE (classification success,0; 1.), specificity XS (measure of the
test ability to express the correct results – test quality),
positive predictive value (PPV) – correctly detected
events from all detected events, and negative predictive
value (NPV) – falsely detected events from all detected
events.

Figure 8 Confusion matrix for dataset shown in Figure 7.
Notes: Diagonal elements represent the number of points correctly classified
(predicted label = target true label) and off-diagonal elements express mislabeled
samples. The higher the diagonal values mean, the better is the result of the
classifier.

10-fold cross validation technique can be summarized
into the following steps:
1. Break data into ten sets of size n/10.
2. Train on nine datasets and test on one.
3. Repeat ten times and take the mean accuracy.
Table 4 summarizes the results of tests on a total of 77
EEG signal recordings using GP–SVM automatic epilepsy
classification algorithm. Results are separated into groups
defined by ictal and interictal class and seizure type labeled
by the neurologist.

The following test results display increased performance in
epilepsy classification using basic feature set and compressed
feature set with compression level 5 for a photosensitive
patient. Table 5 displays the compressed basic vectors for
occipital electrode O1. Table 6 presents results of the test
comparing the performance results with PPV and NPV. A
total of 356 events were recorded in the testing session.

Conclusion
This paper presents a novel method for automatic epilepsy
detection using a combination of GP and SVM as a GP
fitness function value and second stage stacking style

classification for final ictal/interictal class. This novel
method improves the overall performance of the SVM
classification by dramatically reducing the size of input
feature vector. According to the results, the accuracy of
this algorithm is very high and comparable, and even
superior to other automatic detection algorithms. 14 In
combination with the great efficiency, this algorithm can
be used in real-time epilepsy detection applications. Test
results of the algorithm can be seen in the “Results and
discussion” section.
The results of the algorithm’s classification are of high
sensitivity and specificity, except for the Generalized Tonic
Clonic Seizure (GTCS). This bad performance might be the
result of the small number of testing subjects with this specific
seizure and also strong artifacts (moving, EMG) interfering
with the original EEG signal. This had caused low PPV and
X10 for this type of seizure.

Future work
This algorithm is currently being deployed and implemented
on mobile device for real-time multimodal epilepsy detection
using EEG emotive headset with a combination of acoustic,
visual, and mechanic (accelerometer) modalities that support
epilepsy detection. As the next step, the optimization of the
compression stage and the final SVM evaluation stage is in
place. More data need to be obtained on GTCS to improve
the overall classification score for GTCS.
All the results and calculations described in this article
had been performed using python and scikit libraries. Currently, this algorithm is being implemented on android
phone device in Java to provide fully mobile support for
the mobile non-clinical environment automatic epilepsy
detection system.
