Abstract
Emotion is an internal and subjective experience that plays a significant role in human life. There are several
methods of recognizing emotions in people, the most authentic of which is using physiological signals, as they
are beyond one’s control and strongly correlated with human emotions. This study aims to develop an emotion
recognition system based on three physiological signals, namely, brainwave, heartbeat, and facial muscular
activity. It utilizes deep neural network (DNN) and the T method of Mahalanobis-Taguchi system (MTS) to
process the multiple physiological signals and further recognize the states of human emotion. As such, nine
emotions are effectively recognized on a two-dimensional model through the DNN, then compared against
several other algorithms, such as MTS, SVM, Naive Bayes, and K-means, where its superior accuracy is
validated. Moreover, although the T method only improves the classification accuracy on the valence state, it
rather obtains the intensity of emotion in different states. Furthermore, in this study, the proposed DNN is
implemented into a wide range of applications for an accurate understanding of the human emotional states,
whereas the T method is utilized to respond to the emotional intensity in different states. Finally, a real-time
emotion recognition system is developed with DNN as the classifier; this system can directly monitor the
variation of the human emotion through reliable and objective emotion analysis results from the physiological
signals. Thus, the method can provide useful treatment effect information for robots or assistive apparatus
serving activities of daily living.

1. Introduction
Emotion recognition is a key technology of human-computer interaction. Recent studies on recognizing emotions
have extensively focused on facial expressions, speech, posture, and physiological signals (Adolphs et al., 1996), but
since understanding and expression of emotions promote interpersonal communication, human–computer interaction
methods that pay attention to the user’s emotional information are more suitable. Emotion recognition based on
physiological signals has significantly different characteristics compared with that utilizing speech-and-image elements;
thus, the former method becomes an important direction in the field of affective computing (Picard et al., 2001).
Psychology and physiology provide evidences of strong correlation existing between physiological responses and human
emotional states. For instance, the physiological signal is directly controlled by the autonomic nervous system and is not
subjectively influenced by the subject; therefore, the recognition result becomes more realistic and objective (Andreassi,
2000). Through measuring electrocardiogram (ECG), the arousal emotion could be assessed by the ratio of sympathetic

value and parasympathetic value (Tanaka et al., 2017). Agrafioti et al. (2012) devoted to analyzing the ECG pattern to
determine the arousal state for emotion recognition. In addition, facial electromyography (EMG) is a technique for
monitoring the facial muscle activities. For emotion recognition, zygomatic and corrugator muscles’ activities are usually
used to identify valence emotion, such as smile and frown. Former study had studied individual differences in emotion
perception according to facial EMG signals (Künecke et al., 2014). Furthermore, electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis
is one of the most effective approaches to identify emotions. An emotion recognition method based on EEG features were
proposed (Mehmood et al., 2017). Lin et al. (2010) proposed a framework to process EEG-based emotion recognition.
Studying EEG is valid for comprehending the human emotion. Generally, previous studies used a single physiological
signal for judging emotion and ignored the fact that different emotional states may trigger multiple physiological signals,
through which a fusion analysis may more accurately identify specific emotional states. Emotion recognition technique
is useful to various fields. Especially, during the rehabilitation, it is necessary to understand patients’ mental state, which
may provide medical staff to know their current condition further give mental assistance to patients. In our previous
research (Tanaka et al., 2016a), we focused on developing an assistive walking device for hemiplegic patients and the
elderly due to muscle weakness. The device can drive the joint in the ankle to trigger stretch reflex mechanism and further
raise the user’s leg via a muscle linkage effect to prevent them from stumbling. Nevertheless, from the viewpoint of
rehabilitation, the patients’ physical and mental aspects should be considered. Rehabilitation is a long-term and difficult
work, and the patients are required to maintain their mental states for completion of the tasks involved. In other words,
the mental states of the users are taken into account prior to using the assistive device for rehabilitation (Tanaka et al.,
2018). Moreover, we applied the beat sounds to investigate the emotional variation of human in walking (Tanaka et al.,
2016b). Afterward, we used the clustering algorithm to analyze the physiological signals mapping on the two-dimensional
(2D) emotion map (Zhang and Tanaka, 2017) and attempted to control the assistive walking device using the users’
heartbeat signals (Tanaka et al., 2017). To recognize emotion precisely, we introduced DNNs to classify the multiple
physiological signals, along with an answered questionnaire, and then identified nine emotional states on a 2D emotion
map (Zhuang et al., 2018).
Herein, we aim to develop such emotion recognition system that is based on the analysis of multiple physiological
signals, extracted via emotional stimuli experiments, and apply the proposed classification algorithms to accurately
realize the states of human emotion on an arousal–valence plane. Our final goal is to employ this emotion recognition
system to real life for offering beneficial in various fields.

2.1 Emotion model
Figure 1 (Posner et al., 2005) describes a 2D emotion model using two indicators, valence and arousal, of emotional
state measurement. Valence is represented by the horizontal axis, which is divided into two types of emotions: positive
and negative. Positive emotions refer to feelings that are pleasant, i.e., happy and contented, whereas negative emotions
include unpleasant feelings, i.e., sad, upset, etc. On the other hand, arousal is indicated by the vertical axis and reflects
the intensity of the emotions.

2.2 Questionnaire Survey–SAM (Self-Assessment Manikin)
Imprecise understanding of words in conventional studies has often led to wrong description of emotions. Bradley
and Lang (1994) attempted to solve this problem by designing a picture tool called Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) to
directly evaluate pleasure and arousal. SAM is mainly characterized by a nonverbal pictorial assessment, that is, it uses
simple figures to describe the dimensions of the emotion model. Moreover, SAM representative expressions provide a
range of dimensions from smiling to frowning (pleasure) and from excited to relaxed (arousal). In our experiment, we
presented a level 1–7 scale for both dimensions, as shown in Fig. 2.

2.3 Physiological signals
Methods of emotion recognition based on physiological signals analyze the autonomic and central nervous systems.
Recognition based on the autonomic nervous system identifies the corresponding emotional states through measurement
of physiological signals, such as heart rate, skin impedance, electromyography, and respiration (McCraty et al., 2015).
On the other hand, recognition based on the central nervous system analyzes signals generated by the brain under different
emotional states (Jenke et al., 2014; Javaid et al, 2015; Ismail et al., 2016). Emotion is recognized through changes in the
physiological signals using both methods and cannot be hidden; thus, we can get objective results. This paper considered
the measurement of three physiological signals, namely, heartbeat, brainwave, and facial muscle activity.

3. Emotion elicitation experiment
3.1 Normative–affective stimuli
Samson et al. (2015) proposed a film library storing 199 film clips (51 positive, 39 negative, 59 mixed, and 50
neutral), which were selected from 300 clips. These film databases are available for eliciting positive, negative, and
mixed emotional states. The emotions of 411 participants stimulated by watching the clips were recorded and analyzed.
Based on the participants’ ratings, the researchers could give the films an accurate judgment of the emotion they elicit.

3.2 Experiment devices
Figure 3 shows the devices EEG (electroencephalogram), EMG (electromyography), and ECG (electrocardiogram)
acquired using EMOTIV EPOC+, Personal EMG, and myBeat, respectively.
(1) EEG: We used EMOTIV EPOC+ (Emotiv Inc., 2018) with 14 channel electrode caps to collect the brain signals.
The 14 channels were AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, and AF4. We used two references
(CMS/DRL) at P3/P4. The sampling rates were configured at 128 Hz. Built-in digital 5th order sinc filter (at 50–60
Hz) was applied to EEG signals at a bandwidth of 0.16–43Hz.
(2) EMG: We used Personal EMG (Oisaka Electronic Device Ltd., 2018) as our surface muscular activity acquisition
device. The EMG and iEMG (integrated electromyography) were sampled at 3000 Hz using a 12-bit A/D converter.
EMG sensors were placed on zygomatic and corrugator muscles for measurement of “smile” and “frown,”
respectively.
(3) ECG: We used myBeat (Union Tool, Co., 2018) to obtain the heartbeat signals. Sampling rates were 1000 Hz. From

a matched visualized software, we were able to obtain real-time records of people’s heart rate. We determined LF/HF
(LF: low frequency (0.04–0.15 Hz)/HF: high frequency (0.15–0.4 Hz)) ratio to understand the balance of a human
autonomic nervous activity.
Consideration of the practical application, it is necessary to prepare the simple wearable devices without losing the
accuracy of recognition emotion. In this study, we used the portable brainwave detector, wearable heartbeat detector, and
muscle activities detector to build the emotion recognition system. Muscle activities detector could be replaced to a
wireless type of muscle activities detector in the future. Through consideration of the practical application and the
effective physiological signal selection, the authors prepare these three physiological signals.

3.3 Emotion elicitation experiment protocol
Before the experiment, the authors carefully explained the experiment condition and attained the consent of each
subject. We did not force the subjects to conduct this experiment. Twenty healthy students (16 males and 4 females; 21–
27 years old) participated in the emotion elicitation experiments, presented in a rigorous arrangement to ensure the quality
of the collected physiological signals. Figure 4 depicts the actual experimental scenario. Elicitation materials consist of
30 films selected from the film library. At the experiment onset, the MVC (maximum voluntary contraction) of each
participant was measured for preliminary assessment of the ultimate ability of their muscle activity. The setup of the
emotion elicitation protocol was as follows:
(1) Rest period: The subjects were asked to calm themselves and relax for 1 min. The generated physiological signals
were recorded as their baseline.
(2) Emotion elicitation period: The subjects were asked to watch the emotional stimuli clips.
(3) Self-assessments period: After watching each clip, the subjects were instructed to evaluate their emotion by
completing a 30-s survey questionnaire.
(4) Washout period: Before going to the next clip, the subjects watched a 30-s washout video, mainly of a landscape
accompanied by light music, to eliminate the emotional influence of the previous clip.
Figure 5 describes the entire emotion elicitation process. Compared with pure visual or auditory stimulation,
watching a video film can simultaneously stimulate people’s visual and auditory senses and, thus, can give them a
stronger sense of substitution and better emotional evocation. Throughout the experiments, the subjects were instructed
to wear three physiological detectors. In the experiment, the number of subjects exhibited gender imbalance. However,
to prevent the difference caused by gender, we had eliminated the individual difference for each subject through
processing the physiological baseline signal.

4.2 Feature extraction
We employed the mean and maximum values of the generated physiological signals as the features represent the
physiological level of the emotion data from the experiment, as we proved these parameters to be more sensitive than the
other values in our previous experiences. All the features were calculated from the raw physiological data, which were
collected while the subjects watched the specific film clips. Table 1 presents the 17 extracted features, processed by the
raw data of three physiological signals (EMG, ECG, and EEG). Previous researches have shown that the levels of
biological signals are significantly different in subjects, as each has a unique physiological baseline. Therefore, the
physiological baseline signal measured at the initial recording period was utilized to eliminate the effect of individual
differences on the experimental results. Thus, the 17 extracted features were calculated by dividing the raw physiological
signals with the baseline signal to obtain sample data for individual differences.

4.3 Evaluate dataset
We collected the experimental data to determine the correlation between emotion and physiological signals, rather
than to obtain the precise emotion elicited in response to a specific stimulus. Hence, it did not matter whether the response
emotion did not match the expected emotion. In general, human emotions are dynamic, due to different environmental
factors, including culture, nationality, and memory. The same stimulus may elicit different emotions in different people
(or even to the same person) or situations. We compared the actual emotional states (based on the questionnaire results)
with those from the database, as shown in Fig. 7. In the right side of the figure, the actual emotions were generally close
to the selected emotion stimuli area; nevertheless, with respect to personal independence, the same emotions could be
felt in different stimuli. For example, after the subjects watched the films eliciting excited and un-pleasure (solid red
circle) emotions, some subjects had responses close to those on the database, whereas others gave different feedback. As
the factual basis of this study, the actual emotional responses of the subjects were used. After the emotion elicitation
experiment, all actual emotional responses would follow our emotion definition (in Section 4.1) to as emotion label. After
that, we used the emotional label to correspond to physiological data (17 extracted features indicated in Section 4.2).
From the mentioned steps, we created the 20 subjects’ physiological signal-emotion dataset.

5. Methodology
5.1 Feature selection
We selected a valid amount of physiological data from the experimental results and removed redundant information
to prevent data noise from greatly reducing the accuracy of our data classification. In the process, we proposed feature
selection to improve both the recognition result and the efficiency of the classifier and obtain only the valid features. In
principle, feature selection extracts only the most effective of the features available as different types carry different
signal information. For example, some features may express one’s emotions more clearly, whereas others may contain
invalid information. After selection, we individually analyzed the valence and arousal emotions; thereby, we had two
classifiers.
Moreover, we utilized the information gain ratio, a statistical method that employs entropy to evaluate the worth of
an attribute by the measured gain ratio (Karegowda et al., 2010) for this study. Table 2 breaks down the selected
physiological features of the two emotional states. We selected the valid features according to the rank attributes
calculated via the gain ratio; hence, we were able to trim down the number of extracted features for both states. The
extracted features for the valence axis went down from 17 to 9 and from 17 to 11 for the arousal axis.

5.2 Deep neural networks
After processing the physiological signal data, we applied the classification methods for emotion recognition. In
particular, we used DNN, a digital simulation of the biological neural networks (LeCun et al., 2015). Corresponding to
the organism’s nervous system, the artificial neural network is also composed of a large number of neurons as basic
functional units, as in the many nerve cells of a biological nervous system (Sutskever et al., 2014), constituting neural
modules with different functions. Each module performs its functions and cooperates to complete varied tasks.
DNN is a supervised learning method, described by hidden layers and a softmax classifier; each layer undergoes a
layer-by-layer training initially before the whole neural network is trained. Furthermore, DNN training minimizes the
difference between an output and an input. In this paper, we necessarily had to label the corresponding physiological
data before learning. The emotional label is the emotional evaluation data for the stimuli tested during the experiment.

Journal of Advanced Mechanical Design, Systems, and Manufacturing, Vol.13, No.4 (2019)
We specifically used the activation function RELU and gradient descent algorithm for our proposed DNN for processing
of a highly nonlinear problem; moreover, we employed softmax layer for classifying the learned features of the deep
network structure. The weight and bias parameters of the softmax layer are trained through the supervised learning
methods. After the network has completed learning of the parameters in the softmax classifier, the algorithm must finetune them in the entire network simultaneously, which improves all weights for all layers through backpropagation
techniques with supervised methods. Additionally, backpropagation processes are used to learn network weights and
biases based on marked training examples, for minimizing classification errors.
Herein, by collecting all physiological data and questionnaire answers from 20 subjects, we built the training set to
create the DNN models. We constructed two classifiers, one with 9 neuron nodes of valence emotional states and the
other with 11 neuron nodes of arousal states. The three hidden layer neurons had 60, 30, and 20 nodes, respectively,
giving three output classifications, as shown in Fig. 8 (a). Moreover, the number of neurons in the input layer was the
same as the number of dimensions of the feature vector, and the number of neurons in the hidden layer was determined
through repeated experimental training. If there are too many nodes in the hidden layer, then over-fitting will occur;
otherwise, under-fitting is expected. The softmax classifier outputs the probability of categorizing the emotional states,
where the final discriminant results are the most probable. Figure 8 (b) reveals the accuracy and loss function of the
valence and arousal classifiers (learning rate: 0.01; number of epoch: 500). Results of the test sets indicate that our
constructed DNN was able to fit the training sets and then achieve high accuracy with low loss.

5.3 T method of Mahalanobis–Taguchi system
Subsequently, we divided the emotions on both axes into three classes. However, based on the results, we could
know only the classes of emotions, but not their intensity; as such, we used the T method of the Mahalanobis–Taguchi
system (MTS) for prediction.
The T method technique was developed by Genichi Taguchi for overall estimation of calculated values based on
the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio (Taguchi, 2005). Compared with MTS, this method does not need to use either the
Mahalanobis distance, or the Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization, to remove variables. In general, the T method follows a
three-step procedure.
First, a unit space is chosen from a sample dataset (for an a number of sample datasets), including the output values.
Thus, the unit space (xij; i = 1, 2, …n; j = 1,2, …k) is the dataset that presents the relation between the input and the
output values (yij; i = 1, 2, …n; j = 1 and 2) (Taguchi, 2005; Kawada et al., 2015). The unit space scale is shown in Table
3, for n number of sample data. The input and values represented the extracted features and the questionnaire results,
respectively.

Second, the signal space is constructed with the rest of the sample data after selection of the unit space. The data
of the signal space would be normalized by subtracting its average values (Xij = xij - 𝑥̅𝑘 ; Mij = yij - 𝑦̅) (Taguchi, 2005;
Kawada et al., 2015). Normalization of the signal space (input value: Xij; i = 1, 2, …l; j = 1,2, …k; output value: Mij; i =
1, 2, …l; j = 1 and 2) measures the data offset from a given unit space. The number of the signal space datasets is l = an. Table 4 illustrates a normalized signal space scale. Furthermore, the unit and signal spaces are used for construction
and validation of the predictive model.

Third, sensitivity (β) (the sensitivity of the output concerning the input data) and S/N ratio (η) are calculated using
Eqs. (1) and (2) (Taguchi, 2005; Kawada et al., 2015), respectively. These data give an overall estimation of the actual
output value. Table 5 shows the sensitivity (βj (1,2)) and S/N ratio (η j (1,2)) of each xj.
From the mentioned steps, the predictive model can be established, and the overall predicted output (Y), which is
expressed in Eq. (7), can be obtained by a weighted integration with the corresponding S/N ratio.

6. Results and discussion
6.1. DNN results
As mentioned earlier, we normalized the experimental data of physiological signals for various emotional states.
We selected a total of 460 emotional samples as the training set for the classifier and used another 50 samples as the test
set. We can separately divide each valence and arousal state into three groups using our proposed DNN and achieve a
classification accuracy of up to 79.2%, for discriminating the valence state (un-pleasure, neural, and pleasure), and 81.1%,
for discriminating the arousal states (un-excited, neural, and excited). To validate this accuracy, we employed other
algorithms (SVM, Naive Bayes, and K-means) and compared their accuracy with that achieved by DNN. For the
comparison, we conducted several classification accuracy measurements and determined the average accuracy, as shown
in Fig. 9. Results confirmed that our method could attain the highest accuracy following the same data processing
procedure. As classification accuracy is sometimes influenced by the initial weight and bias of the data, we moderately
adjusted these parameters in each layer of the whole neural networks. The layered structure of the neural network maps
the sample in the original space into a new feature space through a layer-by-layer feature transformation, thus making
the classification easier. Moreover, by feature selection, it can effectively improve the classification accuracy by
extraction of the most important input features to the DNN while eliminating the worse effect from irrelevant features.
We can dig a deep relationship between the features through the deep structure of DNN; therefore, our DNN classifier
is capable of recognizing human emotions in the next step.

distribution with score 2 as unit space.

Through individually discriminating the valence and arousal states into three groups, we were able to obtain a
combination of the nine emotional states. Figure 10 gives the recognition results of DNN. The graph on the left shows
the results of combining the two classifiers on a 2D plane, where the nine emotional states are displayed; each color
marker represents the data recognizable in the specific emotion class, such as “excited but un-pleasure.” Moreover, the
cross symbols represent unrecognized data, which contain misclassified emotions. On the other hand, the graph on the
right presents grids that correspond to the emotional states of the left-side graph and their respective classification
accuracy. Here, 27/11 would mean that for 38 data, 27 are recognized and 11 are unrecognized, thereby giving an
accuracy of 27/38 × 100% = 71.1%. From the point-of-view of the database results, we believe that good emotion
prediction is achieved when the user is stimulated by a specific film, which is depicted by our recognition results that
were located at the region similar with that of the database. Moreover, we think that better emotion prediction is achieved
when a specific film stimulates the user, which is depicted by our recognition results and the user response
(questionnaire) being located in the same region. Nevertheless, based on our experiences with different people, our
recognition method can achieve approximately 70% of accuracy, indicating its feasibility, and further, its ability in
general, to predict real emotion.

6.2. T method results
Following the procedure in Section 5.3, we utilized the specified unit and signal spaces to individually predict the
output on the two axes (valence and arousal states). Furthermore, based on the two distributions (positive and negative
states on a single axis) of the predicted output, we could respectively classify the “unpleasant or pleasant” and
“deactivation or activation” on the valence and arousal states.

With this method, selection of the unit space would create substantial influence on the results. At the first trial, we
selected the datasets of score 4 as unit space for the two axes; however, the results yielded a figure of the two distributions
overlapping. Thus, we could not use this dataset as unit space to classify the emotional state. Next, we applied the
datasets of other scores. Finally, for the valence state, we found the datasets of score 7 as unit space giving the best
classification results; the overall distribution results displayed that “happy” and “unhappy” can be discernibly classified
on the valence state. Figure 11(a) shows the distribution of scores 1-6 against the overall distribution: Scores 1, 2, and 3
are locally distributed in the right side from 0 while scores 5 and 6 in the left side from 0. Hence, for the valence state,
this situation illustrated overall distribution results having a one-directional tendency (from negative to positive emotion),
which is consistent with the direction of the emotional score axis. Correspondingly, on the arousal state, the datasets of
score 2 as unit space yielded better classification results (“un-excited” or “excited”) than the others. Figure 11(b) shows
the individual distribution of scores 1 and 3-7 against the overall distribution: Scores 4 and 5 are locally distributed in
the right side from 0 while scores 1 and 3 in the left side from 0. Although some scores showed irregular phenomena,
the overall distribution results had a one-directional tendency.
Furthermore, these results indicate that we can observe the emotional intensity in different states through the
individually distributed score. To verify the accuracy of the T method, we examined 30 test samples 10000 times. The
resulting classification accuracy was 77% and 47% for the valence and arousal states, respectively. The classification
accuracy of arousal states showed the low value. We thought that the score distribution mainly concentrated at score 3,
4, and 5, which may lead to difficult to classify the data by using the T method for judging unexcited and excited. We
will add more subjects to participate in the emotion elicitation experiments to further acquire the more valid data, then
increase the classification accuracy.

6.3 Discussion
We devoted our time on recognizing states of human emotion through classification algorithms. Two methods
demonstrated advantages on this respect. Firstly, through DNN, we were able to accurately classify nine states of emotion
on a 2D model. During validation, DNN outperformed the classification accuracy of conventional algorithms. In addition,
it reduced the calculation time, which makes it very suitable for real-time emotion recognition. Secondly, although the
different human emotions could be easily recognized, their intensity was needed for a more precise evaluation of the
mental states; thus, through the T method, we were able to individually distribute the scores of each emotion and
determine their intensity. Should assistive robots and other advanced technology be allowed to use the technique we
employed in this study, it is inevitable that they could accurately predict or recognize the emotional states and, further,
mental states of people.

6.4 Real-time emotion recognition system
Finally, we developed a real-time emotion recognition system using the proposed DNN as the classifier. The system
is presumed to quickly process many physiological signals and accurately recognize emotion. Initially, we collected realtime physiological data from users. Next, the data was analyzed for feature creation, feature selection, and data
classification via the Python Software. Before using the platform, we first had to establish the suitable DNN model. A
trained DNN model can operate on the physiological signal features input to the emotion recognition platform to output
the emotional states we need to identify. Finally, we mapped the classification results on our developed emotion
recognition interface. During practical applications, we found that users were uncomfortable wearing the facial sensors,
i.e., makeup factor in women. Thus, we tried applying the system without the sensors and observed good results. Figure
12 illustrates the respective flow diagram. As a whole, the recognition system is composed of data input/output, feature
extraction, DNN, and emotion recognition modules.
To evaluate the efficiency of this system, we conducted the same emotion elicitation experiment as in Section 3.
We asked subjects to watch four specific stimuli videos (on the 2D plane; for “un-pleasure and excited,” “pleasure and
excited,” “un-pleasure and neutral,” and “pleasure and neutral” states) and then compared the output of the system with
the actual responses (questionnaire results) of the subjects. Figure 13 presents the results. We observed that these
recognition results have a tendency similar to the specific stimuli. However, the actual emotions of the subjects are the
most important. We further compared the actual emotions of the subjects with recognition results. From the actual

response results, for the valence recognition, we found that the recognition results could achieve 83.3 % recognition
accuracy to actual response (here, for 12 results, 10 results are same as actual responses, thereby giving an accuracy of
10/12 × 100% = 83.3%). For arousal recognition, the recognition results could achieve 50% recognition accuracy to
actual responses (here, for 12 results, 6 results are same as actual responses, thus, an accuracy of 6/12 × 100% = 50%).
We believe that when the participants filled out the questionnaire, the answer of the arousal evaluation was too neutral
(subjects usually answered score 3, 4 and 5), which may lead to system misjudgment, thus it leads to low accuracy. In
the future, we will focus more on the analysis of neutral answers. We believe that increasing the number of subjects and
thus improving the deep learning model will help improve accuracy. Although the recognition accuracy was not very
high, we still can prove our system that exhibited a possibility to as the practical application in recognizing human
emotion. In the current article, our system is applicable to younger people (21-27 years old) and has not yet extended to
other age groups, such as the elderly. Due to the different emotional characteristics of different age group people, in the
future, we will not only increase the number of subjects but invite different age group people to conduct more experiments.

7. Conclusion
In the research field, emotion recognition has always been met with complicated and comprehensive details. In this
study, we proposed algorithms of recognizing human emotions using multiple physiological signal inputs, which may
prove beneficial in real-life applications.
To resolve the problem of high feature dimension and large computational complexity in emotion recognition, we
employed DNN and the T method. Our proposed DNN was trained by datasets of 20 people's physiological signals with
questionnaire results and came out to successfully identify nine states of human emotion. We validated its superior
accuracy over conventional algorithms through a comparison of their respective classification results. Furthermore, to
deeply comprehend the mental state of an individual under an elicited emotion, we employed the T method and assessed
the intensity of such emotion. T method achieved a high accuracy rate on the valence state, although it had some difficulty
on the arousal state. In our future studies, we will optimize the existing algorithms to address this issue. Hence, with
these two techniques, we could successfully predict and further recognize the emotion of a certain individual. At a later
part, we presented a real-time emotion recognition system for practical applications in different fields; the algorithm
includes a fast and accurate identification of the user’s human emotion. We verified its efficiency by assessing human
subjects through an experiment identifiable to an earlier test, which yielded affirmative results. We believe this system
can offer advantages for human use; for instance, assistive apparatus or devices adopting it can recognize the mental
state of rehabilitation patients, which further reflects the pacing of their progress. Our future work direction includes,
aside from an already mentioned objective, developing techniques to improve the classification accuracy of our human
recognition methods and system (incorporating an emotional intensity function to the system) and applying them into a
practical device to improve the quality of human life.
