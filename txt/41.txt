ABSTRACT EEG signals are an important tool for monitoring the brain activity of a person, but
equipment, expertise and infrastructure are required. EEG technologies are generally expensive, thus
few people are normally able to use them. However, some low-cost technologies are now available.
One of these is OPENBCI, but it seems that it is yet to be widely employed in Human-Computer
Interaction. In this study, we used OPENBCI technology to capture EEG signals linked to brain
activity in ten subjects as they interacted with two video games: Candy Crush and Geometry Dash.
The experiment aimed to capture the signals while the players interacted with the video games in
several situations. The results show differences due to the absence/presence of sound; players appear
to be more relaxed without sound. In addition, consistent analysis of the EEG data, meCue 2.0 and
SAM data showed high consistency. The evidence demonstrates that interesting results are able to
be gathered based on low-cost EEG (standard) signal-based technologies.

I. INTRODUCTION

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a research area
related to the design and use of technology and computers by
people. Preece et al. [1] define HCI as pertaining to designing
a computer system that supports people so that they can carry
out their activities productively and safely. As HCI primarily
focuses on people, evaluating the user experience is a basic
concern. User eXperience (UX) is defined by ISO 9241-210
[2] as the perception and responses of a person resulting
from the anticipated use of a product, system or service.
UX does not have one single definition. The Nielsen
Norman Group [3] consider UX as "Senses, feelings,
emotional response, assessment and satisfaction of the user
and of the interaction with the provider". Meanwhile,
Hassenzahl [4] relates UX to how people perceive
interactive products, taking into account two dimensions: (1)
pragmatic quality is related to how the user manages to
perceive the product in performing a specific task to achieve
its objective; (2) hedonic quality is related to the
psychological needs and emotional experience.
UX is concerned with the emotional and affective
aspect in entertainment media such as the video game. The
term Player eXperience (PX) thus duly emerged. The
experience of playing video games is multifaceted,
VOLUME XX, 2017

depending on the game type, as well as the amount of
experience the players have and the skills they possess. As
González et al. [5] indicate, video games can be considered
a special interactive system, the objective of which is to
make the player feel good when playing. PX may thus be
considered as a particular case of UX, but with very specific
dimensions. It involves UX characteristics with player
dimensions using a broad set of attributes and properties to
measure the experience of players when playing a video
game. In the literature, we find several definitions related
with PX in games. In 2011, Gerling et al. [6] defined the term
PX as follows: “in video games, [PX] describes the
individual perception on the interaction process between
player and game”. Lazzaro [7] meanwhile mentions that the
two definitions are not the same. This is because UX is
related to the experience of use, and PX is the experience of
play.
Evaluating PX is challenging because we have to
consider its specific aspects. Therefore, HCI and video game
researchers are starting to learn from each other. This article
discusses the evaluation of the user experience in interactive
entertainment systems, such as video games.

Video games are able to induce emotions in the player.
For example, learning in video games can be difficult, as they
require significant effort from players to achieve the set goal.
This can turn into a challenge, as can learning to play the
game itself. In contrast, the game may be quickly abandoned
because trying to advance may be a frustrating experience.
In the video game field, different types of players are found.
Some players are more skilled or have more experience than
others so that the skill levels of some players are not suitable
for the difficulty level of a certain game. One of the aspects
that affects UX is the level of challenge. In addition, the
attention span of a player can affect his/her level of
immersion [8].
Video games themselves have different forms of interaction:
traditional forms such as the mouse, keyboard, or joystick,
as well as non-traditional ones such as the touch screen. The
type of interaction can therefore affect user experience in
interacting with a video game. A number of studies have
sought to evaluate user experience through proposed
qualitative methods (direct observation, interviews, surveys
and focus group) [9-10] and quantitative methods [11].
Different methods are used in different stages of
development of a product, reflecting the importance of
evaluating before, during and after use of the product. Some
authors focus on evaluating emotions. SAM (SelfAssessment-Manikin) was created to assess the affective
states [12], and PrEmo [13] is an instrument specifically
designed to measure emotions. PrEmo uses pictograms that
represent 14 emotional states. Applying these questionnaires
to the user, the emotional state upon interacting with a
product must be determined, even if the user experiences a
number of emotional states within a short period of time
during the interaction. Other questionnaires have been
created to assess UX, such as the UEQ (User Experience
Questionnaire) [14] composed of 26 items grouped into the
following six scales: attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency,
dependability, stimulation and novelty.
Use of these techniques/methods can result in the
player becoming distracted while interacting with the
system. In addition, the questions must be asked at specific
moments [15]. With other methods such as recording or
direct observation, it is not possible to identify when there is
frustration or confusion in users. Moreover, a questionnaire
can be delivered to players directly after playing, but the full
experience is not contained in their memory. Questionnaires
provide a way of obtaining quantitative insights into player
feelings and attitudes, but they lack the depth of objectivity
of metrical measures. Another type of evaluation, heuristic,
carried out by a group of specialists, does not evaluate the
end user and experts only intuit about the use of the
technologies and the possible impacts they might have on
users.
As a result, the questionnaires and techniques that exist
to evaluate aspects of UX are behavioural, and in other words
not as objective as they might be. The responses and physical
reactions identified in the users are very subjective, and very
often fail to detail any relevant aspects that can affect user
VOLUME XX, 2017

experience. Today, physiological responses [16] are being
implemented to evaluate such UX aspects as emotions and
perceptions. Technologies for measuring physiological
signals can aid in the evaluation of UX, identifying small
variations that cannot be perceived directly.
Techniques and methodologies enable affective data to
be gathered without asking users what they have experienced
and how they feel. Studies have been carried out on
measuring affective perception using physiological methods
that feed from body responses including body temperature,
pupillary response, galvanic skin response (GSR),
electromyography (EMG), plethysmograph (blood pressure
and volume), and electroencephalogram (EEG). Currently,
there is a growing interest in studying and decoding states
from physiological responses, not only in evaluating UX of
video games but also applied to industry and health. Today,
researchers working in the field of neuroscience have used
the electroencephalogram (EEG) technique using BCI
(Brain-Computer Interface) technology, based on
monitoring, analysing and decoding signals captured from a
subject. These EEG signals are obtained through electrodes
placed on the head of a subject. The signals are captured
during a stimulus or other type of mental/motor activity, the
objective of which is to find a correlation between the action
executed by the subject and the brain response generated.
BCI was developed in response to the need to
understand the behaviour of human beings when presented
with technology such as a video game and enables analysis
of neuron physiology through the study of neuronal waves.
It is thereby possible to capture the EEG signals of a person’s
brain activity [17]. EEG activity comprises a variety of
waves identified by frequency, localization or amplitude.
EEG signals are directly related with the functional activity
of the brain, and the process of decoding and classification is
related with the associated type of action. Therefore, the aim
of the studies in this article is to decode the EEG signals
associated with UX while a subject is interacting with a video
game.
The development of this technology brings about new
problems. New technology can often mean high costs, and
fewer people being able to access it. Additionally, it is
necessary to learn which signal types to use. EEG devices
measure brain activity through one or more electrodes placed
on the scalp. However, processing techniques must be
applied to determine the relevance of the information, and
without extensive medical expertise. In addition, it is timeconsuming, requiring approximately one hour in some cases
[18]. The captured EEG amplitude values are very small and
noise may occur in the signal due to sudden movements or
artefacts [19]. Capturing EEG signals requires patient
preparation, which involves applying conductive gel to the
scalp to improve electrical conductivity [20]. Dry electrode
technology is used as a novel mechanical design to achieve
improved connection with the skin without the use of
conductive gels. However, the type of dry comb electrode
used in OPENBCI [21] that can penetrate the hair and make

direct contact with the scalp may cause the patient to
experience an unpleasant pain.
One of the main problems when using EEG
technologies in HCI research is their high cost. It is expected
that their costs will decrease, and no technologies will
become available. However, for now, the low-cost
technologies are also providing relevant results.
This work presents a study of UX through EEG signals
using OPENBCI, an open-source approach based on a low
cost hardware device.
The main objective of this study is therefore formulated
through the following research question: Is a low-cost open
source EEG device capable of collecting information to help
evaluate UX?
II. BACKGROUND

Today, with the growth of technology, different ways
of interacting with video games have been implemented. The
games have been implemented in a number of areas, with
specific purposes. They have thus captured the imagination
of researchers studying cognitive and emotional processes
through brain activity that occurs while playing.
There is stronger interest in the HCI line from
researchers evaluating UX through physiological responses.
As a consequence, EEG signals have become a field capable
of adding new dimensions in the field of HCI.
Today, researchers aim to evaluate emotions through
psychophysiological responses using several means with the
support of technology. One research group [22] conducted a
study of pupillary response using eye tracking to sense
changes in arousal while gaze analysis revealed the focal
attention of the user during moments of increased arousal.
Arousal detection has thus been used to identify frustration.
These authors focused on frustration-induced arousal, using
common causes of frustration during user interaction,
comparing pupillary responses between frustrating tasks and
normal tasks. The authors discuss how arousal sensing opens
up research avenues for usability and accessibility testing.
Other authors [23] meanwhile explore the relationship
between eye movements and the pupillary response from
formative user experience.
Elsewhere, researchers [24] observe that responses
obtained through the physiological responses of a subject are
usually involuntary, and as such may be more objective. In
using sensors to capture physiological signals, the responses
captured are uncontaminated by the verbal response of the
participant. These measures are more sensitive when
capturing responses in real time, within which context an
evaluator cannot manage to identify every detail while
observing the subject at play.
A number of studies have been conducted [25-28] in
which electrodes were used to capture the brain activity
responses of a subject. Physiological sensors can be used to
take account of changes in the body of a subject in HCI [29].
These include recording EEG signals to analyse brain
VOLUME XX, 2017

activity responses upon interacting with a multimedia system
[26-27].
According to some research [30], the predominant
waves for measuring cognitive load in frequency analysis are
the Theta and Alpha waves. Changes in these two wave types
are related to cognitive performance [31]. For example,
when the eyes are open, a suppression of Alpha activity
occurs, indicating alert attention. There are certain EEG
parameters that are widely used for measuring mental
workload. A low amplitude of the Alpha wave is assumed to
represent the attribution of attention more than a high Alpha
amplitude. A high Theta amplitude represents an increase in
the load of a task: the smaller the amplitude, the lower the
load.
In 2015, a group of researchers analysed video game
effects using brain waves [32]. They sought to analyse brain
wave Alpha-Beta signals during the playing of a game, with
the aim of analysing the effect of stress during play.
Applying an analysis of Power Spectral Density (PSD) per
histogram on the Fp1 channel for each type of wave, they
identified that, as the player begins playing, Alpha waves in
this region decrease, while Beta waves in the Fp2 increase.
The same authors concluded that more subjects experienced
more high frequency Beta waves, which indicate that a
person is in a state of stress, while before playing the subject
is in a state of relaxation.
Research presented by [33] evaluated UX using EEG
measurement techniques. The authors applied an
experimental study with eight participants (four men and
four women) between the ages of 20 and 40. Each evaluation
was applied individually, in which each participant was
shown five videos in order to induce different emotional
states, e.g., disgust, serenity, or enjoyment. Some of the
videos were shown with and without audio.
EEG is related to the cognitive and emotional states that
may be captured from a subject. Work carried out by [34]
proposed to capture brain activity signals using the EEG
technique to evaluate user experience upon interacting with
a system. To evaluate UX, they proposed three methods:
mental load, attention and error recognition. Their
experiment consisted of evaluating the user in the course of
interacting, but they selected two interaction types –
indirect, using the keyboard, and direct, using Touch. To
measure UX, an analysis of EEG signals was carried out for
the Delta, Alpha, Theta, and Beta wave types. Analysis of
the EEG signals was performed at a spectral and temporal
level. The authors employed 32 electrodes using the EEGLab
library: AF3, AFz, AF4, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, FC3, FCz,FC4,
C5, C3, C1, Cz, C2, C4, C6, CP3, CPz, CP4, P7, P3, Pz, P4,
P8, PO7, POz, PO8, O1, Oz, and O2. Other authors [35]
carried out a study of EEG signals while interacting with
video games. The authors performed an analysis of the
signals in the frequency domain, where they observed
changes in the Theta (4-8 Hz) and Alpha (8-13 Hz) wave
types. They further observed that the Theta waves increased
in the frontal lobe, while in the parietal lobe the Alpha waves

decreased. Authors have used the NASA-TLX questionnaire
to validate the workload induced.
For this study, 128 channels were used, recording a subject
for 3 minutes as they played. To perform a spectral analysis,
they also used the Welch method of spectral density
estimation. In 2019, a group of researchers [36] used two
types of waves (Alpha and Beta) to identify mood: when the
Alpha wave is in a low state, it indicates stress, high means
reluctant, and optimal indicates relaxed. A low Beta wave
means lack of attention, high indicates anxiety, and optimal,
focused. The experiment consisted in the user playing a
video game called DX-Ball while the signals were captured
using the Neurosky Mindwave Mobile 2 system as BCI. The
system features two electrodes, one located in the frontal
lobe (FP1) and the other in the temporal lobe (T3).
In 2015, researchers examined surprise effects in a serious
game using EEG Signals [37], where players were exposed
to surprising situations. Authors used Neurosky’s Mindwave
Mobile to capture the brain activity.
There are video games whose purpose is entertainment,
while others are more educational and are called serious
games. Affective studies evaluate the player's emotion [38]
and cognition using psychophysiological methodology.
Therefore, techniques of affective computing have received
much attention in video games, both in entertainment and
serious games [39], where those studies supported subjective
methods to validate the consistency using questionnaires,
such as: Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) [40], Game
Engagement Questionnaire [41], and others.
In addition, some researchers have worked with commercial
video games to analyse the effects of video games with a
brain-computer interface. Carrera et al. [42] used fivechannel EMOTIV and participants played the video game
Call of Duty, which aimed to provide an early insight into
how playing a video game with an EEG-based BCI would
impact a participant’s mood as compared with a traditional
video gaming setup. Commercial video games have been
used to analyse emotions, including Little Big Planet2 [43],
Counter Strike [32], DX-Ball [36] and Quaker3 Arena [44].
III. VIDEO GAMES, EMOTIONS AND GENDER

Researchers are interested in studying how video games
impact the emotional experiences of players. Emotions are
feelings that are experienced over a short time and can
change rapidly [45]. Emotions are associated with activation
of certain regions in the brain. When a player is gaming,
he/she can experience various emotional responses if the
game becomes too boring or too exciting. Entertainment is
commonly related to games. A study made by Salminen et
al. [46] showed that games with different characteristics (i.e.,
Tetris, Super Monkey Ball 2, Monkey Bowling 2 and James
Bond 007: NightFire) presented different emotional
responses. A study presented by Porter and Goolkasian [47]
used two types of video games, Mortal Kombat and Tetris,
VOLUME XX, 2017

to determine the effect on stress. Authors found that the
players presented higher positive emotions ratings while
fighting, while the puzzle game (Tetris) players presented a
stress response. Therefore, the video games include
attributes, such as: type of interaction, storytelling, colours,
mechanics, sounds, and other elements that can influence the
emotional state. A study presented in 2000 by Wolfson and
Case [48] measured the impact of emotions when changing
the colour and sounds of the video game. A study was
designed by researchers [49] to analyse how the
physiological effects of colour in EEG signals can influence
perception and attention. Various colours showed effects on
the mean power of Alpha band, Theta and on the total power
in the Theta-Beta EEG bandwidth.
In addition, video games do not have the same emotional
effects on people. Researchers have examined the role of
gender in video games. Studies have shown that men and
women prefer different types of gaming experiences [50].
Another study presented by Desai et al. [51] examined the
effects of player gender. Authors found differences both by
gender and by gaming experience.
Therefore, video games have effects on emotions of players,
which can be influenced by elements of video games
including type of interaction, storytelling, and colours,
among others. However, they may affect females and males
differently.
IV. METHODOLOGY

The brain activity of five male and five female subjects
was recorded and analysed for each experiment. The mean
age was 20 years old and none of the subjects suffered any
discomfort or pain during the recordings. All experiments
were conducted in a quiet room and with the subject seated
playing a video game. In our study, the OPENBCI EEG
device used was configured using the Cyton board
(+reference, +ground) and eight channels (Fp1, Fp2, T5, T6,
T3, T4, O1 and O2), using as reference and ground those
located in positions A2 and A1, respectively. A sampling
frequency of 250 Hz was used to capture the EEG signals.
Recordings were composed of four tasks: 90 s eyes closed,
180 s playing a video game, 90 s eyes closed and 60 s
answering two questionnaires: meCUE 2.0 [52] and SAM
[53]. Both are considered as qualitative assessment
instruments, a common practice to allow the players or
participants to self-assess their emotions and perceptions.
Figure 1 shows the flowchart of the experiment protocol,
where 153,600 data points per channel were captured for
each subject in 10 minutes.

The meCUE 2.0 questionnaire is based on the component of
the user experience model (CUE-Model). The SAM (SelfAssessment-Manikin) questionnaire was created to assess
the emotional states of participants and is made up of three
pictographic scales, each with five humanoid drawings,
which represent each of the three dimensions of emotion:
Valence (Pleasant-unpleasant), Arousal (Relaxed-active)
and Dominance (Dominant-dominated). Two case studies
were applied in this experiment: (1) a video game featuring
direct interaction, called Geometry Dash1; (2) a video game
featuring indirect interaction, called Candy Crush2. Figure 2
shows the methodology of the experiment.
The raw data were captured using Processing (Java). In
addition, the raw data recorded were processed offline using
signal processing techniques developed by MATLAB. As
seen in Figure 2, two PCs were used: one for capturing EEG
signals and the other by the player.

FIGURE 3.

Procedure for EEG signal processing.

In the Signal capture stage, the skin of the subject was
carefully cleaned at the positions determined for the wet
electrodes, and the electrodes were placed on the skin of the
scalp. In the pre-processing stage, the signals collected were
then divided into segments and processed off-line using
MATLAB, the EEGLab library. According to the work
presented by [70], a high-pass filter using fourth-order
Butterworth filter was applied to remove frequencies below
0.2 Hz, and a notch filter was used to remove power line
noise. The signals were segmented and grouped by gender.
The method used were proposed by [32]. In the Feature
extraction stage, FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) was applied,
where the average of the first two thousand samples and the
last two thousand samples is calculated for each segment for
each subject, thereby revealing the differences between the
initial and final reaction of each segment with the aim of
reducing the dimensionality of the sample to 384,000 data
points. Having separated the data by channel, gender and
segment, the signal in the frequency domain was transformed
by applying FFT to analyse the data. In the last stage, Data
analysis, the MATLAB EEGLab library was used, obtaining
a representation of the signal by wave type. The EEG signals
vary in frequency and amplitude. There are five basic EEG
frequency patterns: Delta (0-4 Hz), Theta (4-7 Hz), Alpha (813 Hz), Beta (13-35 Hz) and Gamma (35 Hz and higher)
[56]. According to the studies presented in the background,
the wave types analysed were Theta (4-7 Hz), Alpha (8-13
Hz), and Beta (13-35 Hz) [56].
A. PARTICIPANTS

FIGURE 2. Methodology of the experiment.

The procedure carried out for this study is shown in Figure
3, in which a set of steps is followed in order to analyse the
EEG signals. In data analysis, the PSD (Power Spectral
Density) was calculated, taking the highest amplitude value
(peak). The PSD was obtained by applying FFT (Fast Fourier
Transform) to the power of the square to the signal. PSD was
applied for each electrode [32, 54-55] to determine
differences between the type of wave for each electrode.

Ten subjects were selected (five male and five female), aged
between 18-23 years, with an average female age of 19 and
male age of 21 (mean=20, SD=1.8). Each subject provided
their signed, informed consent to participate in the study, at
which point the conditions and protocol of the experiment
regarding publication of the data were explained. In turn, the
procedures followed met the human experimentation ethical
standards according to the Helsinki declaration. All
participants had some prior experience with video games.

The OPENBCI device was used to measure the electrical
activity of the brain using electrodes placed on the skin of

the scalp. According to previous studies [57], EEG signal
quality is excellent using wet electrodes with an appropriate
preparation of the skin and the use of a conductive gel, aimed
at reducing skin-sensor interface impedance [58]. The type
of electrode used, therefore, was Gold Cup, applying
conductive gel to the scalp of the subject. When too much
gel is applied, however, it excessively presses on the scalp.
In the skin preparation, the subject must wash his or her hair
with coconut soap, with the aim of establishing a better
contact area between skin and electrode and to reduce the
impedance (between 10 kOhm to 5 kOhm).
Two types of video games were selected. The first, Geometry
Dash, whose interaction is through a computer and keyboard,
can be said to involve direct interaction. Geometry Dash is a
video game created in 2013 by the Swede, Robert Topala. In
synopsis, the focus of the game is the completion of various
levels. Stars, coins, power fragments, diamonds and keys
may be earned in the course of the game. The second game,
Candy Crush, which makes use of a smartphone, involves
indirect interaction. The mechanics of Candy Crush involve
gathering three of the same kind of candy to build up a score.
Questionnaires were also used for evaluating each
participant. The questionnaires were meCUE 2.0 [52] and
SAM [12]. The meCUE 2.0 questionnaire is based on the
component of the user experience model (CUE-Model). This
questionnaire has five modules: Perception of the quality of
the instrument (Module I), Perception of non-instrumental
qualities (Module II), Emotions of the user (Module III),
Consequences of use (Module IV) and Global assessment
(Module V). The meCue 2.0 questionnaire is a scale that
relates its variables bi-directionally, and allows an accepted
analysis of user experience for desktop applications, web
applications, video games and other types of interactive
systems. For this study, modules II and III were used. The
questionnaire features a Likert scale of 1 (strongly disagree)
to 7 (strongly agree).
The SAM (Self-Assessment-Manikin) questionnaire was
created in 1985 by P.J. Lang [53]. It assesses the emotional
states of participants and is made up of three pictographic
scales, each with five humanoid drawings, which represent
each of the three dimensions of emotion: Valence (Pleasantunpleasant), Arousal (Relaxed-active) and Dominance
(Dominant-dominated). The questionnaire utilizes a Likert
scale from 1 to 9, where 9 is the best score and 1 the lowest.

FIGURE 4.

an EEG cap.

The second phase makes use of the two qualitative
assessment instruments - meCUE2.0 and SAM. It is possible
to capture 153,600 data points per channel for each subject.
For the eight channels used, a total of 1,228,000 data points
were captured per subject. With 10 subjects participating,
therefore, 12,288,000 data were collected.
Once the signals were segmented, the results were grouped
by gender, since we sought to show differences by gender.
An algorithm was implemented in MATLAB to calculate the
average of the first two thousand samples and the last two
thousand samples of each segment, for each subject, thereby
revealing the differences between the initial and final
reaction of each segment with the aim of reducing the
dimensionality of the sample to 384,000 data points.
V. RESULTS

Tables I and II show the results obtained for the two video
games, separated by gender and channel. To identify the
behaviour of the signals, maximum values were taken for the
Alpha, Beta and Theta wave types for each channel. In turn,
they were subdivided into segments according to the activity,
as follows: Candy Crush with sound, Candy Crush without
sound, Geometry Dash with sound, Geometry Dash without
sound. Each segment was divided into an initial and final
phase for each activity type.

C. PROCEDURE

The subjects were first asked to close their eyes for 90 s.
They then followed the two phases proposed for data capture.
In the first phase, the subject interacts with the first video
game for 90 s, without sound, followed by another 90 s, this
time with sound, repeating this same process with the second
video game (see Figure 4).

and 20% (7); Arousal 40% (9), 20 (8) and 20% (6);
Dominance 20% (8), 20% (7), 20% (6), 20% (2) and 20%
(1). Meanwhile, the results for males were as follows.
Valence 40% (9), 40% (7) and 20% (6); Arousal 40% (9),
20% (8), 20% (4) and 20% (1); Dominance 20% (9), 40%
(7), 40% (5) and 20% (2).
Figure 6 shows the results obtained with the Candy Crush
video game, where 40% (9) of the participants rated the
valence at 9, 40% at 7, 10% at 6 and 10% at 5. Valence
scored 9 for 40% of men and 20% women, and Arousal for
40% (9) of men and 20% (8) of women.

The results obtained in the meCUE2.0 questionnaire from
module III, which correspond to assessing player emotions
for both video games, are shown in Figure 7. It is observed
that women (Figure 7a) have an average of 4.23 positive
emotions and men (Figure 7b) presented an average of 5.08
positive emotions.

of Fp2. Channels O1 and O2 are related to visual stimuli. T5
and T6 are related to certain memory functions. Therefore,
for the Alpha waves, the most active areas are the frontal and
occipital regions.

VI. DATA ANALYSIS

The analysis of the captured data was carried out according
to three aspects: by gender, by presence/absence of sound,
and by interaction type (direct or indirect). One Spectral
Density (PSD) analysis per histogram was applied for each
electrode position for Alpha and Beta waves.

In Figure 9, the results obtained for the Geometry Dash video
game are observed: the Fp1, Fp2, T5, T6 and O1 channels
are activated more in men, and the T3, T4 and O2 in women.
In men, the active Fp1 and Fp2 electrodes relate to the frontal
lobe and are associated with emotions [60]. The hemispheric
valence theory [61] argues that positive emotions occur in
the left frontal cortex, while negative emotions occur in the
right frontal cortex. This could be observed in areas Fp1 (left
frontal cortex) and Fp2 (right frontal cortex), where Fp2 was
activated more than Fp1 in women, while in men Fp1 was
activated more than Fp2.

A. GENDER

Differences were compared between gender (male and
female). In Figure 8, the results of the Alpha waves are
observed. It is observed that men have greater amplitude in
the Fp1, T4, O1 and O2 channels. Meanwhile, the most
active electrodes in women are Fp2 and T3. FP1 is related to
attention, organization of responses and is more related to
visual working memory [59], while Fp2 is more related to
emotions. As seen in Figure 8, women had greater amplitude

Figure 10 shows that the Beta waves with the greatest
amplitude during Candy Crush video gameplay in men are
obtained in the Fp1, Fp2, T3, T4, T5 and O1 channels, and
channels T6 and O2 in women.
Beta waves relate to relaxation and originate in the occipital
lobe, which indicates that functioning accelerates when
attentive to visual stimuli or movement, as occurred with
Candy Crush, where in men the occipital region was
activated on both sides of the brain: O1 (left Lobule) and O2
(right Lobule).
Similarly, with Geometry Dash (Figure 9), most electrodes
with the greatest amplitude are from the male gender.

FIGURE 11.
sound.

Alpha waves for the Candy Crush video game with/without

For the Beta waves (Figure 13-14), there is an increase in
changing from no sound to sound for electrodes O1-02, T3T4 and T5-T6 for both games. With the Candy Crush game,
O1 and O2 are activated more compared to Geometry Dash.

The greatest amplitude in the female gender is observed for
Fp1 and O1. It is important to mention that Beta waves have
a frequency range of 13-30 Hz. This type of wave is activated
in mental activities, so it is usually associated with active
things, attention and active focus, or for the resolution of
specific problems. Some studies have found that Beta waves
better describe arousal/alert status [62]. Therefore, a
decrease could indicate a reduction in concentration.

FIGURE 10.

B. ABSENCE/PRESENCE OF SOUND

FIGURE 13.
sound.

Beta waves for the Candy Crush video game with/without

Data analysis was performed for both video games
without/with sound regardless of gender. The results
obtained from the Alpha and Beta waves are shown in
Figures 11-14. Amplitude was observed to decrease when
there is a change from no sound to sound for Alpha waves
(Figure 11-12). Studies have used Alpha waves to measure
stress levels with acoustic stimuli [63].
It has further been reported that the amplitude of the Alpha
wave is reduced and the wave fluctuations increase
significantly in the face of an unpleasant sound, which can
influence the emotion of a subject [64]. Figure 11 shows that
major changes occur with sound and without sound for O1
and O2 (left and right Occipital channels) and that Geometry
Dash elicits a higher activation than Candy Crush. For both
games, T3 was greater without sound, and T4 was greater
with sound. The temporal lobe is related to the recognition
of auditory stimulation, perception and memory.

FIGURE 14.
Beta waves for the Geometry Dash video game
with/without sound.

What was observed in the interaction by auditory perception,
that both Alpha and Beta waves increase, is a response to
stress [65]. Therefore, it can be concluded that people
became more stressed in the presence of sound.
C. TYPE OF INTERACTION (KEYBOARD vs TOUCH)

The results obtained from the Alpha and Beta channels to
evaluate the interaction are shown in Figures 15 and 16. The
results are obtained by averaging the genres and segments

with/without sound. It is observed in Figure 14 that Alpha
waves showed greater activation for a type of direct
interaction - using the mobile device - while the amplitude is
smaller with the computer.
The most active region with direct interaction was the
occipital (O1 and O2). Furthermore, Alpha waves were
observed to decrease in an indirect interaction. Some studies
[66-67] have mentioned that this decrease may be related to
the increased demand for attention and cognitive load, i.e.,
the type of interaction can affect the emotional state of a
subject, since an increase in cognitive load indicates that
their attention span is overloaded, and could produce a
negative emotional state.

FIGURE 15.
Alpha waves from Candy Crush (direct interaction) and
Geometry Dash (indirect interaction)

The Beta waves increase with direct interaction for
electrodes T3, T4, T5, T6, O1 and O2. However, for Fp1 and
Fp2, indirect interaction is greater.

In the meCue 2.0 questionnaire results in module III,
corresponding to emotions, the men had a higher positive
emotional state (5.08) than the women (4.23). In the negative
emotional state, there was little difference between the two.
It could therefore be determined that direct interaction
activates more cognition than indirect interaction, while
indirect interaction causes more effort to be required to
perform the task.
In the SAM questionnaire for the Geometry Dash game, a
valence mean of 7.83 for women and 7.4 for men was
obtained, along with arousal of 6.67 for women and 7 for
men and dominance of 5.83 for women and 5.2 for men.
Relating the results obtained in the EEG signals, the Alpha
and Beta waves present gender differences. A study carried
out to analyse valence, arousal and dominance in the EEG
signals during gameplay [70] found some correlations
between the Alpha and Beta waves.
Using Candy Crush, the valence mean is 8.1 in women, and
7 in men; arousal is 6.33 in women and 5.6 in men;
dominance is 3.6 in women and 5.4 in men. Women thus had
higher percentages in valence and arousal, and men in
dominance. The arousal is related to the activation of
emotion, and valence is the motivational component of
emotion (pleasure vs. displeasure). Dominance, meanwhile,
is related to the degree of control the person perceives over
their emotional response, in which men obtained higher
scores.
It is also worth noting that another aspect related to UX is
visual perception. One of the aspects related to visual
perception in a video game is colour. A study carried out
mentions that there may be an influence of colour on
emotions [71]. Therefore, colour can be a stimulating signal
for a subject. A group of researchers in 2018 [72] performed
an EEG analysis on the visual response to colour variation.
They identified that the FP1 electrode presented changes in
response to varying colours.

FIGURE 16.
Beta waves from Candy Crush (direct interaction) and
Geometry Dash (indirect interaction).

For the beta waves, the frontal and central areas of the brain
predominate. The Beta wave is associated with increasing
arousal and activity [68]. In 2009, Dooley [69] indicated that
this type of wave represents cognitive awareness, activity,
busy state or anxious thinking.
Alpha waves are also observed to decrease when subjects
must perform an indirect interaction. Samples were taken
when subjects closed their eyes for 90 s. Observation was
thus made when they moved from a state of relaxation to
interacting with a video game. In the data obtained, Fp1
positions decreased for the Alpha wave type upon starting
play, while Fp2 in Beta increases, indicating that the person
is in a state of stress upon starting play.

VOLUME XX, 2017

The O1 electrode that is located high in the visual cortex in
the occipital region, and both O1 (left) and O2 (right), are
responsible for colour processing [73]. However, this
analysis should be carried out in a more detailed and
controlled manner, since both video games were similar in
colour.
VII. BCI TECHNOLOGIES

There are a number of BCI systems that can support the
recognition of emotions in computer games. Literature was
reviewed to evaluate the emotions, and researchers have used
some BCI devices such as EMOTIV, EPOC+, MindWave
Mobile, USBamp, and InterAxon Muse, among others [74].
These devices use the standard EEG technique, which
consists of capturing signals of brain activity by means of dry
electrodes. However, wet electrodes provide much better

quality of recorded signals compared with dry electrodes
[58].
EPOC+ is developed by Epoch. This device has 14
channels + 2 references at the mastoids. EPOC+ does not
generally offer access to the data. However, access to the
data can be acquired with a monthly subscription, which can
end up being more expensive in the long run. Given this,
using EPOC requires internet connectivity. The MindWave
Mobile headset is a low cost device, but only provides two
electrodes (A1 and T4). The information is very limited, and
it is used more to measure the level of attention. USBamp is
a biosignal amplifier of medical grade. Therefore, medical
grade device signals are very close to EEG readings.
OPENBCI is an open source DIY hardware and software
device which can be analysed with respect to 4 (Ganglio
board) to 16 channels (Cyton board + Daisy module). In
addition, data can be read with Processing (JAVA),
MATLAB, Python, or OpenVIBE, among others. The
electrode connection of the OpenBCI can include a 3Dprinted headset (Ultra-cortez Mark IV) or any traditional
gold cup electrode system. Therefore, the device is very
modular, and it is possible to fix and replace parts that fail.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS

The analysis carried out in the frequency domain by means
of EEG signals shows that there are differences between
women and men in their interaction with video games.
These differences were further emphasized by the results
from the instruments used, the exception being the SAM test
results with Candy Crush, where differences were minimal.
A high consistency was thus found between the EEG data
and the data produced by meCue 2.0 and SAM.
Differences in EEG signals were also evident in the type of
interaction, with sound and without sound, with the game
without sound being more relaxing, as observed in the Alpha
waves, and more stressful with sound, with an increase in the
Beta waves.

that contribute to the analysis of user experience.
Inconsistencies were also evident between the results
obtained through the questionnaires and the neuronal signals
obtained by EEG. This is because the questionnaires have
subjective components, while the EEG analysis is objective.
Results showed that the use of low cost technology was
nevertheless able to produce results similar to those obtained
using more expensive techniques. As such, a low cost
technology may offer an alternative for evaluating UX.
Additionally, when using high-cost commercial devices,
access to the monitoring data must be paid for through
service plans, depending on the number of users to be
monitored.
Future work would include applying other analysis
techniques that allow relevant information to be gathered in
order to evaluate user experience.

Differences in interaction type are also observed, in which
direct interaction turns out to be less stressful for the
subjects, whereas indirect interaction activates more logical
processes in users. The OpenBCI system provides
economical and non-invasive EEG capture, making the
technology easily accessible, and its documentation is
extensive and complete, facilitating its use. One of the
limitations that arose when collecting data is that when using
Bluetooth for the connection of the OpenBCI programmable
dongle, some data are lost during capture.

[5]

Due to the significant presence of Theta waves in the EEG
signals, a more robust pre-processing of the signal (or the use
of a more precise hardware) is recommended in future work
to eliminate noise signals that can affect the final result of
the investigation. Alpha and Beta waves are characteristics
