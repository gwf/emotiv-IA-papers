Abstract. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is an interface connecting the human neural system and computer.
This article explains the fundamental principles of BCI and devices, which can be controlled using
electroencephalography (EEG). Firstly, this article describes Brain-Computer interface according to obtaining
brain activity. After that, the applications of BCI are proposed, which can be used in clinical practice. In the
experimental part, the external systems are defined. These external systems are operated by BCI technology.
This technology is developed at the Department of Informatics and Artificial Intelligence of the Faculty of
Applied Informatics, Tomas Bata University in Zlin. This BCI system contains EEG technology, which is
responsible for scanning a brain activity with a fourteen-channel device developed by Emotiv company. In
the near future, this design of peripheral systems can be involved in clinical practice in various medical
branches, especially physiotherapy.

1 Introduction
Brain-Computer Interface is a system that enables
detection and analysis of electric signals generated in the
human brain. These brain signals translate into discrete
computer form, which allows communication between
electrical devices and the brain in real time. The
transform and process these signals would partially
recover communication of the impaired human organism
with the surroundings. According to foreign publications,
future potential could have a significant impact on clinical
practice. This can be especially beneficial for
rehabilitation treatment, patients after a stroke, a spinal
cord injury, degenerative diseases of the nervous system,
such as ALS, muscular dystrophy, etc. [1-3]
A neuron is the basic unit of the nervous system. The
main function of this neuron is the transmission of the
nerve impulse. The impulse is an electric signal generated
by ion changes on the surface of the cell membrane. The
groups of neurons create a network in the brain tissue to
transform information for subsequent scanning and
processing electric impulses.
This electrical activity can be obtained by the devices,
which can measure EEG activity. The most popular
companies interesting in the EEG are the Emotiv system
and Neurosky. The devices from the Emotiv system was
used in this research.
The selected device for obtaining electrical activity
with the 14-channel scanner of EEG signals is called
Emotiv EPOC+. It is a scalable system applied in context
research of the human brain. Using this system can record,
identify, interpret the brain activity and due to our control
unit we can provide the ability to control external or
inbuilt system (neuroprosthesis, rehabilitation aids,
*

wheelchairs, household equipment, etc.). Our solution to
a simple dynamic BCI system developed at the Faculty of
Applied Informatics in Zlin, which are well applicable
and universal. As knowledge of small desk computers
Raspberry Pi and Arduino is utilized, compatibility with
any sensors and communication environment is solved via
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, following the current technological
and transmission standards, approaching communication
in real time. The accuracy of classification depends on the
equipment sensitivity and adjustment to a concrete
person. [4-7]

2 Monitoring of brain activity
BCI technology has three types of implementation invasive, partially invasive and non-invasive. The
implementations are based on scanning brain activity.
2.1 Invasive BCI
Invasive implantation of a BCI system means implanting
of electrodes direct to grey matter. Contact of the
electrodes with the tissue is direct. Therefore, the signal is
the highest quality. However, the implementation in the
brain requires an operation, which is not suitable for our
research. Also applied to the invasive BCI can cause
irreversible brain damage. Risks of the surgery are
connected with craniotomy and postoperative changes
accompanied by scar tissue formation. These time
changes may weaken the signal or destroy it. [8]

3 Application of BCI
Currently, many research teams are working on function
BCI applications. The focus is at least partial recovery of
communication of the impaired human organism with the
surroundings. Today, this functioning system using BCI
which includes spelling systems, virtual limb or
neuroprosthesis devices.

2.2 Partially invasive BCI
3.1 Spelling systems

Partially invasive BCI system is also implemented
intracranially. However, a part of the system rest outside
of the brain, not in the grey matter. Partially invasive BCI
system produces a worse quality of the signal than the
invasive system. Nevertheless, the risk of brain tissue
damage is lower. The typical representative of this
technology is electrocorticography (further referred to as
ECoG). [8]

These systems are designed for patients who are not able
to communicate with their surroundings because of a
combined phatic disorder. The most advanced systems
make using „steady state visually evoked potential“
(SSVEP). The EEG sensor of brain signals is
interconnected with a computer. There were developed a
unique application. The person chooses the group of
symbols using SSVEP. The process is repeated until is
choose a specific letter or symbol. This technology
replaces simple verbal communication. [10-11]

2.3 Non-invasive BCI
Non-invasive BCI system monitors brain signals through
electrodes placed on the surface of the head. This system
is called an electroencephalograph (EEG). The EEG is a
record of temporal change in electrical potential, caused
by brain activity. This record contains s broad frequency
spectrum. The frequency range is usually specified
between 0.1 and 100 Hz. The suitable frequency for the
BCI system was detected, which is the range up to 40 Hz.
The non-invasive system is easy to use, but their
major disadvantage is producing a poor quality of the
signal because the skull dampens and disperses
electromagnetic waves formed by the neurons. The
problem mentioned above is solved by mathematical
approximation algorithms implemented in research and
scientific systems and kits included Emotiv EPOC+,
which is used in this research. The first successful noninvasive BCI system was built in 1998. Doctor
Christopher Guger built a system which, „taught“ the
computer how to control 80 movements of both the left
and the right hand using EEG. This system made use of
27 electrodes located on the surface of the head. [8-9]

3.2 Virtual limb
One of the BCI system applications which are used to
compensate the ability to move with a limb is called the
virtual hand. This application shows palms in the graphic
interface. A patient is interconnected with the EEG signal
sensor. The patient imagines the left or the right-hand
movement. The sensor will evaluate electric signals
coming from the brain, and the virtual palm moves the
same as in the patient's mind. [10]
3.3 Neuroprosthesis devices
By processing and interconnecting the EEG signal with
the neuroprosthesis, e.g., spinal cord lesions can be over
bridged with the use of electric impulses. The first
successful experiment using non-invasive BCI system to
recover a palm function in a quadriplegic patient occurred
in the year 2000. [10]
The mention examples indicate that not only the control
actions for hardware platforms may be mapped
universally, but also commands of the operating system
or the system of keyboard shortcuts, without the presence
of any further technological environment. The future
solution to this research will be the introduction of
a complex BCI in the field of applied robotics (e.g.,
neuroprosthesis in CNS injuries), remote controlled

models operation (e.g., assistance robots), external
devices or software operation (e.g., spelling system after
CMP).
A very interesting application can also be a solution to the
lock/unlocked in syndrome problem. These assumptions
are also confirmed by the structure of the applications,
which have been created at the Faculty of Applied
Informatics, TBU in Zlin in recent years. New research
direction focuses on hybrid systems. Interconnection of
the BCI and EMG „ideas can be transformed into
actions.“
Combination of physiological EEG and EMG signals
ranks among strong areas of interest in research on
physiotherapy. The first system makes records of the
brain activity, and the second system measures the
activity inside the patient´s muscles. The differences in
EEG and EMG activities, compared to data in a healthy
patient, may indicate the cause of loss motor skills
function. This can be helpful, especially in different
degrees of movement ability disorders, irrespective of the
type of a handicap. In the future, we will aim to transform
the findings inside our multi-branch team into different
clinical applications in physiotherapy. [3, 12-15]

Hz, with sufficient resolution of 14 bites in one channel
and frequency response within the range of 0.16-43
Hz. Besides, it enables wireless transfer of data, with a
frequency of 2.4 GHz, with a battery enabling continuous
work for eight hours. One of the assets of the equipment
is its possibility to use a saline solution instead of a
conventional conductive gel, to build contact between the
electrodes and the head skin. [20]
The Emotiv Epoc+ is a scientific and research
device which guarantees sufficient, and not only essential
accuracy with its parameters (for the list of specific
parameters of the current system see the reference [20]).
Our team aims to verify the abilities of the sensor and
apply them in clinical research, which is currently being
done.
When the technical design was being developed, the
risk of a low-quality signal, described in the literature on
non-invasive applications, was removed successfully. The
system was tested. Dissertation, theses, and articles were
published. See the reference list. From this information
was built a multi-branch team. This team included
technicians, doctors, and physiotherapists with a focus on
the future application of BCI technologies in clinical
practice. This team can help patients with permanent
impairment of the nervous system, such post-traumatic
states, degenerative and metabolic disorders, strokes and
other neurological diseases. During the first stage, the
team focused on the ability to catch (measure) digitallyprocessed signals using BCI.

4 Experimental part
The aim of this section focuses on our research and
methodology in the sphere of BCI.
The Faculty of Applied Informatics, Tomas Bata
University in Zlin has been solving projects on BCI
systems since 2008. Between 2016-2017 a team at the
Faculty of Applied Informatics, TBU in Zlin developed a
model of a non-invasive, simple BCI system serving to
operate technical equipment as well as a robot built-up
from intelligent components of a robotic kit with LEGO
EV3. See in Figure 4.
External systems are controlled by activating mimic
facial muscles, via the EEG sensor. It can be seen in
Figure 2. The brain headset equipment by Emotiv system
under the specification EPOC+, is a fourteen-channel
EEG signal sensor, with two reference sensors - AF3, F7,
F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, AF4. The
device records signal in sequences, with a speed of 128

At the current stage of the research, we can register
and subsequently evaluate the measurement outputs,
which are based on multidisciplinary cooperation. The
signals are processed and evaluated within a more
extended period (months). After that, the team will deal
with the possibilities of the knowledge application in
practice. It means there is the area of objective evaluation
of physiotherapy, utilizing recognizable activities of brain
regions or evaluating the feedback process in patients with
various types of impairment of the nervous system during
the complex physiotherapeutic treatments. It belongs to
exercise on machines, ergotherapy, psychology, and other
methods. This information has been confirmed by the
results of international research studies focusing on these
problems. See the reference list [16 -19].

4 Conclusion

[14]

The technology of the BCI system is a relatively new
research area, with broad application potential. This
system can be helpful in the possibility of improving the
quality of life in patients with permanent neurological
disease. Up to now much research focused on this neuroinformatics area can be traced. However, in the field of
clinical physiotherapy research activities are at the
beginning, and their possibilities are unknown. The
patient suffering from a neurological deficit has a
possibility of not only a passive rehabilitation, but also of
active help of „concentrated attention – the strength of
ideas“. The first findings in our multi-branch cooperation
with still relatively simple BCI applications indicate new
possibilities in this sphere of medicine.
