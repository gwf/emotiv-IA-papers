Abstract
This paper aims to develop brain-computer interface system based on electroencephalography that
can aid disabled people in daily life. The system relies on one of the most effective event-related
potential wave, P300, which can be elicited by oddball paradigm. Developed application has a
basic interaction tool that enables disabled people to convey their needs to other people selecting
related objects. These objects pseudo-randomly flash in a visual interface on computer screen. The
user must focus on related object to convey desired needs. The system can convey desired needs
correctly by detecting P300 wave in acquired 14-channel EEG signal and classifying using linear
discriminant analysis classifier just in 15 seconds. Experiments have been carried out on 19
volunteers to validate developed BCI system. As a result, accuracy rate of 90.83% is achieved in
online performance.

Introduction
For severe disabled people, assistive technology is very significant aid. It not only let them to make
their life more independent but also increases quality of their life. People who suffer from spinal
cord injury (SCI), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or guillain-barre syndrome needs assistive

technology to make their life survived. Most of these have not ability to perform daily activities
without any help. Global communities are trying to help disabled people meet with their needs.
Also, researchers are currently investigating adaptive technologies that can aid them particularly
in controlling computer and accessing information (Subaşıcıoğlu, 2008). Researchers have been
investigating different approaches to develop effective assistive technologies since 2 decades. The
principal part of these approaches is to be able to convey commands and communicate with other
people without any motor muscular system.
Several ways are used by researchers for interacting without motor muscular movements.
Electrooculography (EOG) based human-computer interfaces (HCI) that are able to determine the
eye movement direction in 2 dimensions. This approach is used to control computer (Borghetti,
Bruni, Fabbrini, Murri, & Sartucci, 2007) and to advance mouse cursor control system (Surdilovic
& Zhang, 2006).
Another promising approach is brain-computer interface (BCI) systems that rely on the use of
signal acquired from brain. BCI systems are field of adaptive technology that make them feasible
for both disabled and able-bodied people not only to interact with each other but to control their
daily activations such as navigating computer cursor, gearing up/down in a car, guiding drone and
more. Unlike conventional control systems (speaking, writing, touching, seeing and more) that
necessitates motor ability, BCI systems are controlled by "Brain" that serves as the centre of the
nervous system and do not necessitates any motor ability. BCI systems include not only either
neurology or computer science also physiology, biology and mathematics, because of complexity
of this interdisciplinary research area. Measuring and exploring brain activity and dynamics include
invasive and non-invasive amplifying techniques. While invasive techniques amplify signal from
deeply placed electrodes on the brain with high cost and surgical intervention, non-invasive
techniques amplify signal from scalp surface with low cost and non-surgical intervention. BCI
systems prefer non-invasive brain signal Electroencephalography (EEG) due to its low setup cost,
good temporal resolution, simplicity of use and mobility. In 1924 Berger amplified EEG signal
from human's scalp which was the leading attempt of researches based EEG (Masson & Berger,
1924)..
In 1964 Walter averaged the EEG signal and revealed the brain response called event-related
potential (ERP). He showed the first ERP component named contingent negative variation (CNV).
This is the pioneering study that investigates ERPs (Walter, Cooper, Aldridge, & McCallum, 1964).
ERPs are electrophysiological response that is voltage fluctuations to auditory, visual or tactile
stimulus (Mesulam & others, 2000). ERP is a wave form that can be amplified from the surface of
human scalp and revealed from online EEG after filtering and signal averaging processes. ERPs
extracted from EEG provide evidences about information cognitive processing in human brain that
is needed in performing BCI systems. Mainly there are two types of ERPs; exogenous and
endogenous components. While exogenous component is a compulsory response of brain evoked
by physical (light, sound and more)activity in external world, endogenous component is a
processing response of brain like mental activities that is/isn’t evoked by external world (Handy,
2005).
In 1965 Sutton et. al detected that when subject has no prior knowledge about stimuli (light or
sound), latency of reaction in EEG signal is longer than when type and dynamics of stimuli is
known before. This is the pioneering study that investigates P300 (P3) wave and oddball paradigm
(Sutton, Braten, Zubin, & John, 1965). P3 wave is an ERP endogenous component elicited during
decision making process. The most common and validated method is implementing the oddball
paradigm, in which low-probability target items are mixed with high-probability non-target items
(Berlad & Pratt, 1995). P3 wave is a positive deflection in voltage and can be evoked approximately

Natural and Engineering Sciences

250 to 500 ms after the stimulus onset (Sutton et al., 1965). While latency of P3 wave elicited by
visual stimuli is 350 to 450 ms, latency of P3 wave elicited by auditory or tactile stimuli is 150300 ms. P3 wave is widely used in BCI systems; mouse control (Citi, Poli, Cinel, & Sepulveda,
2008), spelling (Rakotomamonjy & Guigue, 2008; Rivet, Souloumiac, Gibert, & Attina, 2008;
Ron-angevin & Silva-sauer, 2006), robotic arm control (Potentials, 2011), visual object detection
(Hoffmann, Vesin, Ebrahimi, & Diserens, 2007; Kutlu, Yayik, Yildirim, & Yildirim, 2015). In
2010 Donnerer M. and Steed A. investigated using P3 wave from 8 channel EEG signals in 3dimentional (3D) environment and proved its possibility by developing a BCI system in 3D
(Donnerer & Steed, 2010). Objects paradigm, tiles paradigm and 36 spheres paradigm were tried
to integrate BCI to an augmented reality style control system. 36 spheres is exactly the same
paradigm that is known as single character flashing in conventional BCI 6  6 sized speller scenario.
In 2010 Townsend et. al proposed checkerboard paradigm to enhance BCI based 8  9 sized speller
system (Townsend et al., 2010) that relies on P3 wave from 32-channel 256 Hz. EEG signals. The
system was tested on 18 subjects and compared with row/column paradigm introduced by Farwell
and Dolchin in 1988 (Farwell & Donchin, 1988). As a classifier stepwise LDA was preferred. As
a result, it was seen that proposed checkerboard paradigm is superior to row/column paradigm. In
2010 Su et. al introduced BCI based Chinese speller system that uses P3 wave form 14-channel
250 Hz. EEG signals. The system was tested on 3 subjects. The important property of this study is
channel selection is implemented with three different methods, rough set, F-score and accuracy of
Fisher’s LDA classifier both for Fisher’s LDA and SVM classifiers. Rough set is selected as best
one. As a result, channels that have high impact on classifiers were detected especially in midline
and posterior of brain (Su et al., 2010). In 2011 Postelnicu et. al focused on controlling robotic arm
with XVR (eXtreme Virtual Reality) software using 256 Hz. only 1 channel (O2) EEG and
electrooculography (EOG) signals that could aid disabled people. The system tested on 8 subjects
could convey 4 type of commands; left, right, top and bottom (Postelnicu, Talaba, & Toma, 2011).
In 2011 Ashari et al. developed BCI based virtual telephone keypad that relies on SSVEP (Ashari,
Al-Bidewi, & Kamel, 2011). In 2012 Kaufmann et. al investigated whether N2 wave of ERP can
be used in a BCI based 6  6 speller system, or not. They reached that the best way was using only
P3 wave or both P3 and N2 waves, not just N2 wave. 12-channel 256 Hz. EEG signals were used
and the given results were proven with tests on 51 subjects. Important properties of this study are,
flash duration (31.25 ms) and inter stimulus duration (125 ms) are very short and filtering range
(0.1 Hz. and 30 Hz.) of raw EEG signals is broad. For denoising raw EEG signals any operation
was performed except for filtering. It is seen that though high overlapping on ERPs and notdenoising raw EEG signals, successful results were reached (Kaufmann & Hammer, n.d.). In 2012
for a novel user interaction, Esfahani and Sundararajan achieved to distinguish primitive shapes
(cube, cylinder, pyramid, sphere or cone) using 14-channel mental imagery EEG signals with
features extracted by independent component analysis (ICA) and hilbert transform and linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier (Esfahani & Sundararajan, 2012). In 2012 Jin et. al proposed
BCI based speller system that relies on both P3 wave and motion-onset visual potential. In this
combined system visual stimuli effects includes colour change (blue/green, white/grey), moving
(with 6 m / s speed in 3 cm distance) and both. The system was tested on 10 subjects. EEG signals
were recorded from 12 channels and sampled at 256 Hz. The researchers preferred downsampling
EEG signals to 36.6 Hz. for extracting meaningful features, and bayesian LDA classifier. Also
three different range of durations (0-800 ms, 0-299 ms. and 300-800 ms.) were tried to segment
EEG signals. As a result, in online and offline experiments practical feedback was observed (Jin,
Allison, Wang, & Neuper, 2012). In 2012, Long et. al investigated hybrid using of P3 wave and

Natural and Engineering Sciences

motor imagery to control computer cursor that performs moving on the screen and
selecting/rejecting target with 30-channel EEG signals. They showed that hybrid approach was
more effective than both P3 wave and motor imagery (Long, Li, Yu, & Gu, 2012). In 2012, Blasko
et. al investigated developing three different visual stimuli based BCI systems for different
purposes, using only P3 wave and only N2PC (N2-posterior-controlateral) wave and both of P3
and N2PC waves of EEG signals from 16-channels . These were exploring on internet browser,
controlling robotic arm and a commination tool. As a result, it was reached that accuracy of both
types of waves was relatively higher than that of others (Blasco, Iáñez, Ubeda, & Azor’\in, 2012).
In 2012 Bougrain et. al investigated controlling a JACO robotic arm using motor imagery based
BCI that uses 512 Hz. EEG signals from 13 channels and LDA classifier (Bougrain, Duvinage, &
Klein, 2012). Four different motor imageries (left hand, right hand, both hands and feet) were used
to convey four commands (left move, right move, forward, backward). The important property of
this study is inverse reinforcement learning that focuses on post-processing of BCI system
(Bougrain et al., 2012). In 2012 Shi et. al introduced a novel paradigm BCI based speller system,
sub-matrix based paradigm. In this study, 6  6 sized matrix was divided into 6 number of 2  3
sub-matrices and 6  9 sized matrix was divided into 6 number of 3 3 sub-matrices and their
performances were compared. The system was tested on 7 subjects with SVM classifier using 4,6,8
and 10 electrode configurations and it was seen that sub-matrix based paradigm was superior than
row/column based paradigm, expansion of size in sub-matrix based paradigm did not make the
system slower and 10 electrode configuration gives better results than others (Shi, Shen, Ji, & Du,
2012). In 2013, Velasco-Álvarez et. al investigated the use of wheel-chair on 6 subjects via EEG
signals from 16-channles using navigation paradigm (that uses motor imaginary), in particular,
without visual -stimuli (Velasco-Álvarez, Ron-Angevin, da Silva-Sauer, & Sancha-Ros, 2013). As
a result, they showed online successful implementation. In 2013 Kaplan et. al surveyed exiting BCI
games (chess, mindgame, bacteria hunt, brain invaders, mind the sheep! and a face card game)
relies on P3 wave and explained how shortcomings were handled (Kaplan, Shishkin, Ganin,
Basyul, & Zhigalov, 2013). In 2014 İşcan and Dokur introduced novel BCI system that is character
plotter. It is really an advanced version of conventional BCI speller system. 6 circles were used to
draw character, and 3 circles were used for drawing procedure (undo, raise and ok). The system
was tested on 16 subjects. Steady-state visual ERP of 500 Hz EEG signals from 16-channels are
used with SVM, LDA and nearest mean classifiers. The novelty of this study is, innovative speller,
named as character plotter (İcscan & Dokur, 2014). In 2014 Vourvopoulos and Liarokapis
investigated usefulness and effectiveness of commercial EEG amplifier devices in a robot
navigation BCI application. They reached that Emotiv (tested on 31 subjects) and Neurosky (tested
on 54 subjects) headsets are useful and effective (Vourvopoulos & Liarokapis, 2014). In 2014
Tsuda et. al presented BCI based visual object detection using P3 wave of 4-channal 256 Hz. EEG
signals and oddball paradigm. As visual stimulus 4 different images are used. LDA, k-NN and
nearest mean classifier are applied and compared (Tsuda, Lang, & Wu, 2014). In 2014 Koo et. al
proposed a combined human computer interface (HCI) system that relies on both P3 wave of EEG
and EOG signals. In this system two monitors exist and monitor selection is performed by EOG
signals and task selection is performed by P3 wave of EEG signals. Originality of this study is
requiring half time for decision because of being a combined system. 8-channel 2048 Hz. sampled
EEG signals were used. The system was successfully test on only 1 subject with SVM classifier
(Koo, Nam, & Choi, 2014). In 2015 Bai et. al presented a hybrid BCI system, relies on both P3
wave and motor imagery of 250 Hz. EEG signals, could operate an explorer. The system included
BCI mouse, BCI speller and an explorer. The system was tested on 5 subjects with SVM classifier
and promising results were reached (Bai, Yu, & Li, 2015). In 2015 Combaz and Hulle proposed

Natural and Engineering Sciences

combining P3 and steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) to receive better performance than
when each one is used purely. To see results, three different experiments (pure P3, pure SSVEP
and combined) were designed. While flashings colour of target changes grey to yellow. 32-channel
1024 Hz. EEG signals were classified using SVM classifier. The system was tested on 25 subjects
(9, 8 and 8 of them participated in experiment 1, 2 and 3, respectively). As a result it was reached
that performance of combined potential was relatively higher than that of others. Important
properties of this study are providing synchronizing between display and recording times,
Psychophysics Toolbox (Brainard, 1997) Matlab extension was used and selecting train and test
sets using leave-one-out cross validation (Combaz & Van Hulle, 2015).
Main objective of this paper is to construct a non-invasive BCI system based on P3 wave that
enables neurologically disabled people to convey their needs and to communicate with other people
easily and effectively. The system is based on one of the most effective event-related potential
(ERP) wave, P3, which can be elicited by oddball paradigm. Developed application has a basic
interaction tool that enables disabled people to convey their needs to other people selecting related
objects. These objects pseudo-randomly flash in a visual interface on computer screen. The user
must focus on related object to convey desired needs. The system can convey desired needs
correctly by detecting P3 wave in acquired 14-channel EEG signal and classifying using linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier just in 15 seconds. Experiments have been carried out on 19
volunteers to validate developed BCI system. An accuracy rate of 90.83% is achieved in online
performance.
The remaining of this paper is organized as follows; in Section 2 experimental setup and
database information are performed. Pre-processing and classification algorithms are described in
Section 3. The experimental results obtained with 19 volunteers are given in Section 4. Conclusion
and discussions of results are performed in Section 5.
Material and methods
Database Description
19 no-paid male volunteers (aged between 20-32) participated in this study. All of the subjects did
not have any BCI application experiences. In the course of EEG recordings, subjects were asked
to relax and refrain movements that are redundant.
EEG signals were amplified with Emotiv EPOCH+ with 128 Hz sampling frequency. EEG
signal was recorded from 14 channels from standard locations of 10-20 international system. EEG
electrodes are AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, and AF4.
Experimental Setup
Experimental scenario is designed using OpenVIBE designer software (Renard et al., 2010) and
to provide parallel processing between scenario and EEG amplifier, OpenVIBE acquisition server
is used in a different computer as seen in Figure 2. At the beginning of experiment, each subject
were asked to fill poll to learn about personal knowledge, any neurologic disease experience and
cigarette, alcohol or any drug habits. The experiment didn’t begin for the subject who has
neurologic disease or is drug habit because of negative effect on P3 wave’s both latency and
amplitude. Subjects were seated about 100 cm in front of 30  48 cm sized LCD screen on which
twelve images related to scenario that were on 4  3 matrix in Figure 1 are displayed. The images
shows; house, television, telephone, car, bed coffee, meal, bath, shopping cart, internet modem,
popcorn and heart. The images selected for system in which subjects will be able to request help

using developed BCI. In P3 paradigm each flash lasts 200 ms ( d flash ) and in course of next 100 ms
( d nonflash ) no images flash.

Figure 1. Images shown in the experimental scenario.
The images flashes block-randomly to avoid double flashings, one by one (Fazel-Rezai, 2007).
So interstimulus interval is 300 ms. EEG laboratory layout is shown in Figure 2. Signal processing
and machine learning algorithms are implemented in MATLAB EEGLab toolbox (Delorme &
Makeig, 2004) and WEKA data mining tool (Hall et al., 2009).

Experimental Schedule
All the participants had been informed about EEG recording procedure and ethical issues in the
Declaration of Helsinki, World Medical Association (VMA)-Ethical Principles for Medical
Research Involving Human Subjects (Association & others, 2001), before experiment started.
 In this study, each subject completed an experiment that includes 6 scenarios. And, scenario
includes 12 sessions each of which has 6 runs. Following schedule is used while recording.
 When experiment started in adaptation duration of 10 s ( d adapt ) all of the images are shown
and amplified EEG are not recorded.

 Image that subject will follow during each run is shown as information in 3 s ( d inf ).
Aftermath of each run subjects whispered counted number in previous run.
 Subject counts how often prescribed image flashes in each run. If subject didn’t count
accurately, recording removed and experiment was repeated after warning for attention.
 Random sequence of flashing starts and EEG is being recorded simultaneously.
 Interval of runs is 0.2 s ( druninterval ).
Duration of each run is,

Pre-processings
Filtering
Although P3 wave particularly exists between 0.1 Hz and 4 Hz (Jin et al., 2012), due to
possibility of its existing in higher frequencies (Kolev, Demiralp, Yordanova, Ademoglu, & IsogluAlkaç, 1997) cut-off frequencies is preferred as higher than 4 Hz. 3rd order butterworth
(Butterworth, 1930) band pass filter that has 0.1 Hz low cut-off frequency and 20 Hz high cut-off
frequency is designed to filter data.
Feature Scaling
In this thesis, to suppress the effect of outliers, in all classifiers feature data is scaled to 0 and
+1 range using min-max normalization method before classification step.
Segmentation
For each subject;
 Each run has 12 segments,
 Each session has 12  6  72 segments,
 Scenario has 12  6 12  864 (72 of which had P3 wave and 792 of which has not P3 wave.)
segments.

Feature Vector Construction
Data acquired from channel FC5 is removed because of having very high number of NaN values.
Therefore, remaining process is implemented for 13 EEG channels. The segments obtained from
EEG channels are concatenated and used as features. Features size is
(4)
Feature Size=1 (Dc  Ds )
where Dc is number of channels (13) and Ds number of EEG data in segment.
Ds  (Sampling Frequency)  (Duration of Single Trial)

(5)

=128  0.5
=64 (for avaraging it is preferred as 65)
So, each feature vector size is 13  65  1 845
Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is implemented to disassemble the band passed filtered
EEG signal into artefacts and spontaneous EEG activity. Therefore STNR can be enhanced and
clearer signal can be revealed (Makeig, Bell, Jung, Sejnowski, & others, 1996). ICA is an algorithm
group which tries to achieve blind separation of sources. Observed EEG signal is,
(6)
x(t )  As(t )
where s( t ) is statistically independent sources which is unknown and A is mixing matrix that is
unknown but invertible. The aim of ICA algorithm is to calculate u(t ) that is recovered version of
s( t ) .
(7)
u(t )  Wx
where W is de-mixing matrix that is equal to A 1 and allows to calculate recovered version of
source signal. In this thesis, FastICA algorithm (Hyvärinen, Karhunen, & Oja, 2004) is used for
ICA implementation.
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
The classifier is responsible for deciding on whether acquired signal is produced while focusing
on target or not. In this paper linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier is used for this process.
LDA is mostly used for separating two classes in a multidimensional space. This method is not
computationally intensive because it is based on the 1st and 2 nd moments of each distribution. In
order to evaluate the minimum classification error the two classes are Gaussian with equal
covariance (Mika, Ratsch, Weston, Scholkopf, & Mullers, 1999). It is a limitation of LDA
classifier. The method is based on projection of high-dimensional data onto a line and classifies in
a one dimensional space. Assume that the feature vectors be denoted by x. LDA is defined as the
linear function y  w T x which maximizes the criterion function (Duda, Hart, & D.G., 2012). Subindices denote the groups.

Experimental Results
Experiments with 19 volunteers have been carried out to validate efficiency and availability of BCI
system. It is very important that before performing online experiment, with existing EEG data
subject-based training process is performed for each volunteer for 2 times, as shown in Figure 3.
First training is performed with acquired EEG data during scenario and classifier coefficients are
saved. Then online BCI system is implemented using these coefficients and at the same time EEG
data is acquired and saved.

Figure 3. Performed training process for each volunteer.
At this point, low online performance is observed due to timing mismatch between acquiring
and online scenario software. In order to handle this problem second training is performed with
EEG data saved during online scenario and classifier coefficients are saved. Then with secondly
calculated coefficients online scenario is performed and higher performance is achieved. It must
be mentioned that during first online scenario flashing target sequence of objects are exactly same
as in first acquiring process, while second online scenario can be fully independent.
Using constructed online scenario after 2 training process, at first volunteers self-decides the
object related to desired command then focus on it and count how many times it flashes. LDA
classifier classifies online acquired EEG signal as target or non-target using P3 wave in 3 trials. In
each trial this classification process is performed, then classifier votes majority one as selection.
As a response selected object appears in computer and relates sound file is played. For example
when “car” object is selected, “Get my chauffeur prepare my car” sound plays.
120 objects, which includes 10 number of each objects in Figure 1, are given to volunteers and
asked them to select each one in turn. 3 trials are implemented, so volunteers always counted 3
when focusing on desired object. And classifiers votes majority one in 3 decisions. Figure 4 shows
mean number of correctly selected objects against each object in Figure 1, after BCI system is

Natural and Engineering Sciences

46

tested on each volunteer. 109 of 120 objects are correctly selected by volunteers, this mean
developed BCI system has 90.83% accuracy rate in online performance.
For end user of this BCI system, training and saving coefficients takes 15 minutes and selecting
any desired objects takes just 15 seconds.

Discussion and Conclusion
Objective of this paper is to advance a non-invasive BCI system based on P3 wave that lets
neurologically disabled people to transmit their needs and to communicate with other people easily
and effectively.
In Figure 4 objects that are in particularly at corners of screen (in Figure 1) are wrongly selected,
while others are correctly selected by LDA classifier. It can be said that position of objects in visual
screen highly affects online performance of BCI system. Accuracy rate of 90.83% can be increased
via constructing different shapes and dimensions of visual objects.
The results show that developed BCI system is able to decide on the focused object in a very
short time and conveys command easily. This work can inspire researches to advance robot control
applications using proposed techniques.
