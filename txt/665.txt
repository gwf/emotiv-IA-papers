Abstract

Electroencephalography (EEG) holds promise as a neuroimaging technology that can be used to
understand how the human brain functions in real-world, operational settings while individuals
move freely in perceptually-rich environments. In recent years, several EEG systems have been
developed that aim to increase the usability of the neuroimaging technology in real-world
settings. Here, the usability of three wireless EEG systems from different companies are
compared to a conventional wired EEG system, BioSemi’s ActiveTwo, which serves as an
established laboratory-grade ‘gold standard’ baseline. The wireless systems compared include
Advanced Brain Monitoring’s B-Alert X10, Emotiv Systems’ EPOC and the 2009 version of
QUASAR’s Dry Sensor Interface 10–20. The design of each wireless system is discussed in
relation to its impact on the system’s usability as a potential real-world neuroimaging system.
Evaluations are based on having participants complete a series of cognitive tasks while wearing
each of the EEG acquisition systems. This report focuses on the system design, usability factors
and participant comfort issues that arise during the experimental sessions. In particular, the EEG
systems are assessed on ﬁve design elements: adaptability of the system for differing head sizes,
subject comfort and preference, variance in scalp locations for the recording electrodes, stability
of the electrical connection between the scalp and electrode, and timing integration between the
EEG system, the stimulus presentation computer and other external events.

which can be analyzed to examine how particular cognitive
tasks modulate brain activity. With its small form factor, EEG
holds promise as a neuroimaging technology that can be used
to understand how the human brain functions in real-world,
operational settings while individuals move freely in perceptually-rich environments. Development of advanced
technologies of this manner has been emphasized as a high
priority [1–3], as they will impact a wide range of applications
from enhancing bench level neuroscience efforts [4–7] to
optimizing soldier-system design [8–10].
EEG is among the least invasive neuroimaging technologies and features excellent resolution of neural activity in the
time domain, although it lacks the degree of spatial resolution

Electroencephalography (EEG) has been used for the last
century to study how brain function relates to human performance, and this method is widespread among neuroscience
laboratories. The technique uses electrodes on the scalp to
record electrical ﬁelds generated by neuronal dynamics,

possible with other neuroimaging technologies. Recent
advances in signal detection algorithms (e.g., [11]) and
wireless transmission [12] have led to the development of
numerous wireless, multi-channel EEG systems designed to
eliminate restrictions on the participant’s behavior while
decreasing the difﬁculty of system use and maintenance.
These advancements have greatly streamlined the process for
acquiring data and demonstrate promise for conducting studies in less restricted environments, complimenting recent
research illustrating the gains to be made in this area [13–17].
To date, however, the focus of discussion amongst the
EEG technical development community has been on the
performance of primary system components, and evaluating
the efﬁcacy of new approaches for acquiring data. Examples
include advocating the use of ‘active’ sensors to maximize the
SNR, use of dry, gel-free [18–20] or non-contact sensors
[21, 22], or simply comparing the signal quality of a whole
new system [23–25]. In contrast, there has been very little
objective discussion dedicated to the physical features of the
system that mitigate the general usability of the system, such
as the comfort necessary to wear the system for long periods
of time or adaptability to a wide range of head sizes. System
usability features have a direct impact on the total system
design and its viability for adoption by both consumers and
scientists. Consequently, a detailed comparison of recently
developed wireless EEG systems to a laboratory-grade system
will address pragmatic concerns that beneﬁt the neural engineering community working to develop real-world neuroimaging systems.
In this study, 16 volunteer participants performed the
same seven cognitive tasks during four separate experimental
sessions in the lab. Participants wore a different EEG system
for each of the four 60 m sessions: three commerciallyoriented, wireless EEG systems and a wired, laboratory-grade
BioSemi ActiveTwo system (ﬁgure 1). In addition to comparing the signal quality among the systems [26], we investigated usability features of each system and evaluated their
viability for future system development efforts. The system
evaluations in this report integrate comments from two
populations—feedback from 16 experimental participants
who wore each system and feedback from 11 experimenters
who oversaw the data collection and analysis of the experiment. Importantly, the amount of previous EEG experience
varied across the experimenters, ranging from less than a year

3.80 cm2

to over 15 yr; consequently, this range of experience captures
usability comments based on conventions from established
neuroimaging laboratories, as well as concerns from relatively
novice users learning how to use a new system quickly and
effectively. These evaluations highlight several issues related
to the general usability of an EEG system, and they have been
organized into ﬁve main design elements: (1) the adaptability
of the system for differing head sizes, (2) the participant’s
rating of comfort and preference, (3) variance in the selected
scalp locations for the recording electrodes, (4) the stability of
the electrical connection between the scalp and electrode, and
(5) the integration between the EEG system and event timing
information for the cognitive tasks from the stimulus presentation computer and other external events. Additional
hardware details and related timing accuracy of each system
has been discussed previously [27, 28].

2. Descriptions of the EEG systems
The technical descriptions contained here are intended to
provide an overview of the four EEG systems used in this
comparison study: ActiveTwo from BioSemi, B-Alert X10
from Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM), the EPOC from
Emotiv Systems, and the 2009 helmet-mounted version of the
Dry Sensor Interface (DSI) 10–20 from QUASAR (which we
refer to as ‘HMS’) (table 1). The overview section for each
system provides details about electrode sensors and their
locations, their native recording reference, and the scalp
application method. These descriptions specify how each
system was conﬁgured for use in our laboratory, including
technical information about system adjustments for head size
variability and acquisition options for collecting and synchronizing the EEG data.
2.1. ActiveTwo (BioSemi)—baseline for comparison

BioSemi products are frequently used for EEG research
within the neuroscience community, and as such, this system
served as an example of a laboratory standard to evaluate the
three newer systems marketed to enabling neuroscience in the
real world. The ActiveTwo system is capable of simultaneously recording scalp electrical activity from up to 256
electrodes, but for this study, we used the 64 electrodes
2

J. Neural Eng. 11 (2014) 046018

large to accommodate differing head sizes, with caps ranging
from 46 cm to 66 cm diameter (http://www.Biosemi.com/
headcap.htm). Most of our study participants used the medium/large head cap that ﬁts heads with a circumference
between 56 and 60 cm. The ActiveTwo system is wired, so
the participant must be physically tethered to a data collection
computer. The complementary data collection software provided by the manufacturer, ‘ActiveView,’ is a LabVIEW
(National Instruments , Austin, TX) based script, and as such,
it is easily manipulated to integrate external signals from other
sources (such as a PC parallel port, serial port, TCP/IP, etc).
The native hardware is capable of receiving external event
code triggers from stimulus presentation software through a
single 16 bit interface (which can be paired to up to two 8-bit
parallel ports) using an external integration box which interfaces directly with the acquisition hardware prior to reception
with the PC.

2.2. B-Alert X10 (ABM)

Currently, ABM makes an EEG head unit (X24) with 20
electrodes; however, at the time of testing, we used the BAlert X10 that consists of a ﬂexible plastic strip connecting
nine electrode sites that are located on the standard 10–20
electrode grid at F3, Fz, F4, C3, Cz, C4, P3, POz, and P4
(table 1). Two additional, separate but electrically-linked
electrodes connect to the head unit via wires to provide the
signal reference, which we placed on the right and left mastoids to match our conﬁguration of the ActiveTwo comparison system. The reference electrode leads, which require
minimal gel, attach to the skin via a standard adhesive pad
similar to most medical grade pads. The EEG electrodes
embedded within the ﬂexible plastic strip are ﬂush with the
surface of the plastic. Adhesive sponge discs are attached to
the electrode surface to enable gel to be applied inside a
hollow center (‘donut hole’) of the adhesive sponge to lower
impedance and increase conductivity between the scalp and
each electrode. The system also includes two additional,
optional leads for recording electrocardiography, which were
applied to the left sternoclavicular notch and the right ﬁfth
intercostal rib space. This unit has multiple sizes of electrode
strips to accommodate different head sizes; the small and
medium sizes of the electrode strips accommodated the head
sizes of our study participants. This unit is capable of wired or
wireless (Bluetooth) transmission to the data collection
computer, and we acquired EEG data in the wireless mode for
this comparison study.
The manufacturer-supplied software package supports
integration with secondary sources for event triggering
through a parallel port, serial port or a TCP/IP connection. In
addition, the manufacturer also supplies a C++ SDK and
MATLAB routines compiled in C for communication directly
with the headset, so the user can develop their own software if
desired. The B-Alert X10 system permits event code triggers
via serial or parallel port directly at the wireless receiver.
Consequently, these signals are integrated prior to communicating with the acquisition PC.

version which utilizes the standard 10–20 electrode grid
scheme (table 1). Additional channels are available and can be
placed anywhere according to the researcher’s requirements.
We recorded from two sites on the right and left mastoid to be
used as a reference as this matches previous studies from our
laboratory (e.g. [29–31]).
The ActiveTwo system is unique compared to most other
systems in that it natively records data without reference,
requiring it to be manually subtracted later during processing.
The system is also capable of receiving external event code
triggers through a single 16 bit interface (two 8-bit parallel
ports) using an external integration box (part of the ActiveTwo system) which interfaces directly with the acquisition
hardware prior to reception with the PC.
To place the ActiveTwo system electrodes on the head, a
snug ﬁtting cap with electrode holders is ﬁrst stretched over
the head. The experimenter then inserts a conductive gel at
each electrode site to ﬁll the gap between the scalp and
electrode and then snaps the electrodes into the cap. Although
the gel results in an easily established and relatively stable
electrical connection through non-conductive hair, it takes
time to setup and clean the equipment. The manufacturer sells
the electrode caps in sizes ranging from extra small to extra

data transfer mode. The system is ‘dry’ because it requires no
gel or ﬂuids on the scalp and it does not use any consumable
supplies to collect data. The dry electrodes, which consist of
an array of spring-loaded metallic pins, rely on direct contact
with the scalp. Each sensor has a notch for inserting a tool that
can twist the sensor back and forth to separate hair and
facilitate direct contact between the sensor and the scalp, a
process which is essential to successfully record scalp electrical activity from these electrodes. The electrodes are connected to and spaced around the electrode at Cz by rigid,
hinged bars, so this unit has a very limited ability to
accommodate differing head sizes. This unit can be used in
both a wired and wireless (2.4 GHz proprietary protocol)
mode. To support wireless data transfer, a wireless transmitter
and replaceable battery can be attached to the back of the head
unit. For the system used in this study, the only hardware
option for external event code trigger integration from separate stimulus presentation software is via a single binary
connection to the wireless receiver. In the system that we
used, the native data collection software, ‘Q-Streamer,’ creates a ﬁle with event latencies without event codes. This
necessitates a third-party ﬁle generated by the stimulus presentation software which must be manually synchronized and
integrated with the binary ﬁle generated by the manufacturer’s
data collection software (see [27] for a full description of the
correction routine). We acknowledge that additional options
for synchronizing event information have evolved since the
time of data collection in this study.

2.3. EPOC (Emotiv)

The EPOC head unit consists of 14 data electrodes placed at
pre-designated 10–20 electrode locations: AF3, AF4, F7, F3,
F4, F8, FC5, FC6, T7, T8, P7, P8, O1, and O2 (see table 1),
Electrodes used for reference and common-mode sensing are
hardwired in parallel to locations that approximate the P3/P4
locations and the two mastoids, such that users select their
preferred reference locations (e.g. use either P3 and P4, or
left/right mastoids) and place rubber non-conductive pad in
the alternative location. We chose the mastoid locations to
match our conﬁguration of the ActiveTwo comparison system, placing rubber pads at the P3/P4 locations. Gold-plated,
passive electrodes contact the scalp through saline-soaked felt
pads. The headset also includes two accelerometers for
measuring head movement. This system has a limited ability
to accommodate differing head sizes, because the electrodes
are mounted on semi-rigid plastic arms connected to a plastic
frame that wraps around the head and also contains the battery/transmitter unit. The ﬂexible arms that house the electrodes can be adjusted to small distances, but overall, the unit
does not provide much accommodation for very small or very
large head sizes. The EPOC system only permits wireless
communication between the headset and a USB data collection device via a proprietary 2.4 GHz protocol. Some initial
signal conditioning (ﬁltering, resampling, etc) occurs on the
headset prior to transmission. The system does not provide
means for additional external trigger integration prior to
acquisition by the primary PC, and it relies solely on software-based integration by the host PC. The native data
acquisition software ‘TestBench’ does provide an option for
receiving external events through the PC serial port, although
it should be noted that in separate testing we found substantial
timing jitter and signal drift with this method [27, 28], An
SDK is available from the manufacturer for the headset,
potentially allowing the user to develop their own software to
integrate signal from other sources if desired. Some
MATLAB routines are also available through third parties
although they are not currently developed by the manufacturer directly.

3. Tasks and hardware conﬁguration
3.1. Participants and tasks

Sixteen right-handed participants (seven females) between the
ages of 19 and 45 volunteered to be ﬁtted with each of the
four EEG acquisition systems on four different days. During
each 60 min experimental session, the participant performed
seven cognitive tasks that cover a range of common experiments. These included visual processing tasks with and
without imposed radio frequency artifacts, working memory
tasks (‘N-Back’) with two levels of difﬁculty, an error-monitoring task, and an artifact inducing task which required
participants to perform several speciﬁc muscular actions such
as blinking and jaw clenching [33]. Neuroimaging data from
these tasks are not discussed since they have been described
in part elsewhere [26], and this report focuses on issues
related to general usability of the different EEG systems, not
the signal quality. The order in which the participants
experienced the EEG systems was counter-balanced, but the
task order remained constant in order to compare the systems,
not the tasks. At the end of each experimental session, each
participant provided feedback about their experience by discussing their level of comfort during the experiment.
Experimenters also made notes about their experiences, such
as how long it took to set up each subject, any problems that
occurred, or complaints from subjects. After wearing all four
systems, participants ranked them in order of comfort and

2.4. HMS (QUASAR)

Currently, QUASAR makes an EEG head unit (DSI 10–20)
with 21 electrodes that record in aggregate and contact the
scalp directly. At the time of testing, we used a prototype
version designed to ﬁt within an Army combat helmet with
only nine electrodes that are positioned at the nominal F3, Fz,
F4, C3, Cz, C4, P3, Pz, and P4 10–20 electrode locations
[32]. We refer to this helmet-mounted system, which we used
without the external helmet shell, as ‘HMS.’ The electrode at
P4 is predeﬁned as the reference electrode and a ground
electrode is built into the chin strap. There are no options for
recording mastoid or ear location as a reference, so this system cannot match the reference site conﬁguration of the
ActiveTwo comparison system. The system also includes an
EKG chest belt but it was not used in this study due to
technical issues related to securing the battery and setting the

preference. All participants provided written informed consent in accordance with procedures approved by the Institutional Review Board of the US Army Research Laboratory,
and all testing conformed to the guidelines set forth by the
1964 Declaration of Helsinki.

4.1. System adjustments for head size

Variability in the size and shape of the human head must be
considered when designing an EEG system intended for use
by the general population. Our baseline laboratory-grade
system, the ActiveTwo, accommodates this variation by
creating a range of sizes for their electrode caps, a technique
common for traditional laboratory EEG systems. Their extra
small, adult electrode cap ﬁts a head circumference between
46 and 50 cm, while their extra large cap ﬁts a head circumference between 62 and 66 cm (http://www.Biosemi.com/
headcap.htm). As is discussed in section 4.3, these stretchable
caps ensure electrode positions at standard or modiﬁed 10–20
locations after setting a few reference points. This requires
that a laboratory purchase and maintain several different size
caps for a given study, but it allows for a degree of subjectspeciﬁc customization. None of the other three tested systems
support this degree of adjustment for differing head sizes and
shapes among study participants.
The B-Alert X10 system does have different sizes for the
plastic strip that holds the electrodes on the scalp. These strips
can account for some variability in the length and width of the
head, but not for the variability in the shape or roundness of
the head without also adversely affecting electrode placement
(see section 4.3). The EPOC and HMS share an alternative,
but similar design, where the electrodes radiate out from
speciﬁc locations and attempt to accommodate longer and
wider heads with ﬂexible components. The EPOC utilizes
semi-rigid arms that can ﬂex outward for larger heads; however, some electrodes do not contact the scalp in very small
heads. In contrast, the HMS has a complex system of springloaded joints on arms radiating out from the central (Cz)
location which allow for a range of motion to the each electrode, so it can accommodate most adults. However, the small
heads of children and adults with extremely large heads are
largely incompatible. This additional complexity also creates
additional potential burdens for repair and maintenance of the
head unit.
Maintaining the position of the EEG electrodes on the
head is very important to obtain a stable and reliable signal.
The ActiveTwo cap is relatively stable on the head, as long as
the participant does not scratch their scalp or otherwise adjust
the cap during the recording session; in contrast, the B-Alert
X10, EPOC, and HMS systems are not as snug to the scalp
and can move around if there is sufﬁcient movement by the
user. Although the current comparison study did not require
large-scale, continuous body movement, this instability in
system position will be an issue for stability of recording sites
in future systems designed for use in real-world, operational
settings while individuals move freely in perceptually-rich
environments.

3.2. EEG acquisition

The respective acquisition software for each EEG system was
run on a Dell Precision 690 running Windows XP SP3. All of
the EEG receivers (wired and wireless) were connected to this
PC via USB. Task stimuli were presented with E-Prime 2.0
on a separate Del Optiplex GX620 running Windows XP
SP3. Stimulus events were also logged on the data acquisition
computer, though the method of data transfer varied among
systems due to differences in capabilities (see table 2).
pt?>Although we implemented procedures to acquire
data under as similar conditions as pragmatically possible,
there were some differences among the setup of each system.
Our approach relies on equating electrode position across
systems using the standard 10–20 electrode grid locations.
Consequently, to maximize the spatial alignment of the
electrodes across the recording sessions, the central Cz electrode was placed at the intersection of two measurements: the
center point of an auricle to auricle measurement and the
center point of a nasion to inion measurement. However,
despite this procedure, variability in electrode placement
occurred among the systems (discussed in section 4.3). As
noted earlier, only three of the four systems could use the
right and left mastoid reference since the HMS predeﬁnes the
electrode at P4 as the reference. Furthermore, the systems also
require different interactions between the subject and
experimenter. The EPOC, B-Alert X-10, and HMS systems
are initially adjusted by the subject with minor adjustments in
electrode placement made by the experimenter while the
ActiveTwo requires that the experimenter perform all of the
system preparation with only minor adjustments by the subject. None of these inconsistencies among the system conﬁgurations are expected to negatively inﬂuence the
interpretation of the usability ﬁndings from this comparison
study.

4. Issues affecting system usability
Replicating a single experiment with four different EEG
acquisition systems gave participants and experimenters an
opportunity to compare directly the pros and cons of using
three new wireless EEG systems in comparison with a wired,
laboratory-grade system. We focus the current discussion to
ﬁve main design elements of the tested EEG systems:
adaptability of the system for differing head sizes (4.1), participant ratings of system preference and comfort (4.2), differences in available scalp locations for the recording
electrodes (4.3), stability of the electrical connection between
the scalp and electrode (4.4), and integration between the
EEG system and event timing information for the cognitive
tasks from the stimulus presentation computer (4.5).

4.2. System preference and comfort ratings
4.2.1. Statistics. Twelve of sixteen participants provided

overall preference rating data for all four of the systems,
ranking their most-preferred system as a one and their leastpreferred system as a four. Table 3 shows rank descriptive

When a head unit does not ﬁt correctly, pressure may not
be distributed across the area as designed, resulting in
discomfort for the subject. For the laboratory-grade ActiveTwo system, discomfort typically occurs with a cap that is
too small. Over an extended period of wear, this constant
pressure may result in subject discomfort. However, this is a
rare problem because researchers can select an appropriately
sized cap for the user from a wide range available from the
manufacturer. For the EPOC and HMS systems, however, the
electrode array is held in place by spring-loaded pressure. On
the EPOC, these are plastic pre-bent arms, while the HMS
headset uses spring-loaded metal arms. In both cases, subjects
reported feeling ‘hot spots’ that developed over the hour long
experimental session due to the pressure of the electrode pad.
Generally, these types of complaints did not appear
immediately, but rather after several minutes or even an hour
of wearing time. Also, problems of this nature were mostly
common with individuals with larger heads, due to the
increased pressure created by the spring action (especially the
Emotiv system—see also section 4.3). We did not receive any
similar complaints about the ABM B-Alert X10, likely
because it uses relatively little pressure at the electrode site to
hold it in place.
The ActiveTwo system components worn on the head are
not very heavy (170 g), but both the B-Alert X10 and EPOC
are notably lighter (110 and 125 g, respectively). The HMS,
in contrast, headset is considerably heavier (510 g) and
bulkier than the other units. The heavy HMS head unit
resulted in some reports of neck pain and headaches by
participants towards the end of the experimental session. This
lack of comfort may arise because the weight is focused on
fewer locations on the scalp rather than being distributed
across the scalp in a diffuse number of points, as with the
conventional caps used in the ActiveTwo. Multiple participants noted that the HMS was comparatively heavier, and one
speciﬁcally complained about discomfort due to the system
weight. The EPOC system also elicited similar problems
stemming from uneven weight distribution, as it has fewer
points of contact with the scalp, while no such complaint
arose with the B-Alert X10 head unit. For future systems,
determination of a comfortable, maximum weight for an EEG
head unit will vary across participants, but designs that
minimize pressure points are likely to be more comfortable
overall.
Finally, we were surprised at participant feedback
regarding system application and clean-up. While participants
clearly would prefer minimal gel in their hair, their overall
concerns were biased less towards this factor than towards the
general comfort of use and ease of application; this is

scores for each system, omitting any participants that did not
complete reports for all cases.
The subjective ratings, based on an ordinal scale, were
analyzed using a non-parametric Friedman’s test with
Wilcoxon sign-rank tests for a priori pair-wise comparisons
between BioSemi and each of the other systems (table 4). A
statistically signiﬁcant difference in ratings was found among
the systems overall (χ2(3) = 16.5, p = 001; Kendall’s
W = 0.458). Follow up comparisons reveal that the B-Alert
X10 was preferred signiﬁcantly more often than the
ActiveTwo system (table 4; z = −2.44, p < 05). The rating
comparisons between the other systems suggest that subjects
generally preferred the ActiveTwo more often than the EPOC
and HMS, although these differences fell short of the criterion
for signiﬁcance. Across the group, all of the systems received
rankings ranging from being the most-preferred (1) and leastpreferred (4), except for the B-Alert X10 which was ranked
by all participants in the top two slots, reﬂecting the overall
comfort of the system.
Additionally, thirteen of the sixteen participants provided
comfort ratings for all four systems on a scale from 1 to 7,
with 1 labeled as ‘very comfortable’ and 7 labeled as ‘very
uncomfortable’ table 5 shows the descriptive comfort rank
scores for each system. Similar to the ranking data shown in
table 3, the variability between the minimum and maximum
ratings was smallest for the B-Alert X10 system (1–4)
reﬂecting the overall comfort of the system, although the
HMS also showed a slightly tighter range (1–6) than the
ActiveTwo and EPOC systems (1–7).
A Friedman’s test indicated overall signiﬁcant differences in comfort ratings between systems, (χ2(3) = 20.52,
p < 001; Kendall’s W = 0.526). Follow up comparisons
showed comfort ratings between the B-Alert X10 and the
ActiveTwo were signiﬁcantly different indicating more
comfort for the X10 system (z = −2.35, p < 05), while the
HMS was rated as signiﬁcantly less comfortable than
ActiveTwo (z = 1.97, p < 05) and there was no signiﬁcant
difference with the EPOC system (table 6). For comparisons
of both preference and comfort, including partial data did not
substantially alter the results.

4.2.2. General observations.

Overall, concerns about system
comfort identiﬁed by participants can be grouped into three
broad categories: discomfort due to pressure on speciﬁc
points of the scalp, discomfort from overall weight or
constriction of the unit as a whole, and difﬁculty of general
application and clean up.

reﬂected in the ratings of overall preference described above
(tables 3 and 4). For example, many noted how simple and
non-invasive the saline-based EPOC system was; however,
participants who had a lack of comfort from EPOC pressure
points found this to be a greater problem than the gel used by
the B-Alert X10 or ActiveTwo systems. Likewise, although
the HMS system required virtually no clean-up and only
minimal preparation from subjects, the difﬁculties encountered in twisting the electrodes to achieve a good signal (see
section 4.4) and pressure from the electrode pins outweighed
this advantage. This is probably why participants had an
overall preference for the B-Alert X10 system. Even though it
required some gel, the cleanup was minimal (especially when
compared to ActiveTwo), and it was lightweight with
virtually no problems of comfort, even for participants with
larger head sizes who were included in this study.

ten people wearing all four systems, and compared these data
to the ideal target 10–20 locations for the wearer.

4.3.1. Impact of form factor on electrode placement. A major

challenge in comparing data across different EEG systems is
the inconsistency of electrode locations. Although each
system states the 10–20 locations for the electrodes (the
industry standard scheme based on an inter-electrode
percentage relative to the total scalp distance; see table 1),
the accuracy of these intended locations during an EEG
recording session may vary based on how the EEG systems ﬁt
across different head sizes and shapes. In the conventional
method utilized by the laboratory-grade ActiveTwo system,
the caps stretch between electrode locations to distribute them
approximately equivalently with the percentage-based interelectrode distances from subject-to-subject, and a speciﬁc cap
size is chosen so that the range is correct. However, this
requires purchasing and maintaining multiple caps. In contrast
to this approach, the EPOC and HMS systems target a onesize-ﬁts-all approach by utilizing semi-rigid components that
allow the electrodes some ﬂexibility in ﬁtting different head
sizes; however, the inter-electrode distance (for some
electrodes) is ﬁxed, limiting the total compensation possible
for inter-electrode distances. The B-Alert X10, alternatively,
comes in a range of sizes of electrode strips with a ﬁxed
distance between electrodes and attachment points at the end
of the strips to an elastic headband.
In all of these systems, the manufacturer provides
instructions for placement of the system on the wearer’s

4.3. Variability in electrode locations

EEG acquisition device manufacturers typically describe the
position of their sensors in the context of the International
10–20 system for electrode placement [34, 35] (table 1). Even
though this system is not perfect [36], it is essential for
comparison of brain activity measurements taken in different
labs, which inevitably entails different subjects, equipment,
and approaches to electrode placement. Each of the four
systems discussed in this manuscript features a different form
factor for ﬁtting electrodes to the scalp, which will have an
inﬂuence on the precision and accuracy of electrode placement. We measured the actual electrode locations on a total of
7

J. Neural Eng. 11 (2014) 046018

W D Hairston et al

The three wireless systems showed imprecision at
speciﬁc regions of the scalp based on the form factor of the
head unit. Figure 4 plots this error for each electrode in
relation to the laboratory-grade ActiveTwo system. We found
that the B-Alert X10 repeatedly showed errors and interindividual variability at position POz. This is likely a result of
how the cap is bent in order to plug into the electronics unit
(see section 4.3). Otherwise, the variability of the B-Alert
X10 is similar to variability in the ActiveTwo system. The
EPOC shows the highest amount of error at O1 and O2 at
locations at the back of the head over occipital cortex and F3
and F4 at locations at front of the head over frontal cortex.
These positions are most susceptible to location errors based
on the ﬁxed length of the semi-rigid arms and variability in
head size that changes the distance between these arms when
expanded to ﬁt the head circumference. The HMS shows the
highest amount of position error for the P3 and P4 electrodes
positioned over the parietal cortex. However, since the HMS
has relatively large electrodes, collecting potential across a
broad surface area, the position offset is likely least relevant
for this system.

head based on aligning one or two electrodes to anatomical
landmarks (ActiveTwo: Cz; B-Alert X10: Cz; EPOC: T7/T8;
HMS: Cz). The user must then accept a certain error in
placement of the rest of the electrodes. For the ActiveTwo,
the most common solution to this problem is to purchase a
variety of cap sizes so that the error is minimized for each
subject. For the EPOC, the ﬁxed curvilinear distance between
T7/T8 and the other electrode sites cannot be adjusted.
Similarly, the HMS electrodes radiate out from CZ, which
results in varying 10–20 location errors, highlighting the same
fundamental issue for EEG systems with ﬁxed inter-electrode
distances. The B-Alert X10 allows setting the position of a
single electrode site, but the inter-electrode distances are ﬁxed
along the plastic strip. The strips are pulled tight and fastened
with Velcro to the headband in order to maintain good
connectivity, which allows for some judgment in electrode
placement when the system is put on the wearer. However, it
should be noted that the plastic strip yielded a unique issue
where it buckled in the back, with the plastic strip having to
fold and bunch in order for the connector to align properly,
resulting in some connectivity problems with the electrodes
near the back of the head.
Another critical variation among the systems is the scalp
areas covered by the electrodes (ﬁgure 2). Most notable in the
coverage differences, the EPOC system lacks recording
locations along the midline. When selecting a system for
real-world applications, EEG experiments should consider
which scalp locations produce the strongest signal of interest
and take care to select an EEG system that will provide
consistent and sufﬁcient coverage of these scalp areas across
participants.

4.4. Electrical connection styles, setup time and stability
4.4.1. Styles and setup. Across the four systems, three

approaches were implemented to facilitate conductivity
between the electrodes and the scalp. The ﬁrst was
electrically conductive gel, which is the traditional approach
for laboratory EEG systems used by the ActiveTwo and BAlert X10 systems. This approach allows for electrical contact
through hair, but increases set up time to gel each electrode
(64 for ActiveTwo and 9 for X10) and requires clean up time
for the participant at the end of the EEG recording session.
The application of the gel is accomplished more quickly using
the ABM design because there are only nine channels, and
each electrode has the gel applied prior to application to the
participant’s head. Thus, the experimenter only needs to push
down on the electrode once it has been placed on the
participant’s head to release the gel. The BioSemi system
requires that a syringe of gel be used to ﬁll each electrode
separately after the EEG cap is positioned on the participant’s
scalp, which is time consuming (taking two experimenters
working concurrently around 20 m to gel 64 electrodes).
The second approach utilized by the EPOC system was
saline-soaked foam pads, which is also capable of establishing a connection through most types of hair. The pads are
soaked in saline before they are inserted in the headset, so
there is nothing to apply after the headset is positioned on the
participant’s scalp. This approach is also advantageous to the
participant because the only residue left in their hair is saline.
Since saline is roughly similar to sweat, it dries quickly after
completion of the session and is not bothersome to the user.
The third approach was ‘dry’ electrodes on the HMS
system, which required no gel or additional ﬂuid. The dry
electrodes are designed to work through hair by inserting a
tool into a notch on the top of the sensor and twisting the
sensor back and forth to separate hair, enabling direct contact
between the sensor and the scalp. The pins are spring-loaded

4.3.2. Measurement of variability in electrode locations. To

determine the extent of the variability in electrode placement
between systems, we digitized electrode placement of each
system on ten different individuals with an ELPOS system
(Zebris; Isny, Germany). This generates polar coordinates
(azimuth, latitude, and radius) for each electrode position
relative to anatomical points. These coordinates are compared
to the actual 10–20 coordinates projected onto a sphere using
the radius measured at that location, yielding differences in
cord length between points (error in mm). Error reported here
thus represents the accuracy and inter-individual variability in
electrode placement for each system relative to the
manufacturer’s stated position. For the purpose of this
study, we used the width of the plastic electrode snap for
the ActiveTwo system. Based on indentations and residue left
on subjects’ skin after wearing the ActiveTwo, it is rare that
gel extends beyond this area.
We found that the average error in the placement of the
center of the electrode was comparable for all four systems
(ﬁgure 3). However, if the size of the sensor is taken into
consideration (see the horizontal bars in ﬁgure 3), the HMS
system is the most accurate due to the large diameter of the
sensors. It should be noted that for all systems, including the
ActiveTwo, the size of the scalp area covered by the electrode
compensates for the imprecision in the 10–20 location.

positions and 10–20 positions for each system (error bars show

reliable contact between the electrodes and the scalp at all
positions simultaneously, especially at the Cz location.
Additionally, this system required a ‘settling time’ of
several minutes for the impedance to come within an
acceptable range after application. As a result, the total time
for preparation often matched or exceeded what was typical
for the gel-based systems. In contrast, the EPOC and B-Alert
X10 systems only required a small amount of manual
manipulation of the electrodes to work the conductive
liquid into contact with the scalp because the application of
saline or conductive gel could be completed prior to the
participant’s arrival for the study. Thus, based on the current
designs, the less dense, wet electrode systems were generally
faster to apply than the dry electrode system. The BioSemi
ActiveTwo still required the most time, simply due to the
substantially larger number of channels to set up.
Another component of the total setup time relates to the
ease of reading the current impedance values of each
electrode. The interface for each of the three wireless systems
was easier to use than the ‘ActiveView’ software for the
laboratory-grade comparison system. In ActiveView, the
voltage offset (impedance is not reported, but offset from the
common mode follower circuit is used as a surrogate) is
shown in a bar plot for all 64 channels on the same screen, so
it is often time consuming to decipher which bar on the screen
corresponds to which location on the scalp. In contrast, the
other three systems report impedance in a graphical depiction
that plots each electrode on the scalp, which greatly eases
identiﬁcation. It should be noted, however, that while both the
HMS and EPOC software report in real-time, the current
software for B-Alert X10 requires a manual button click to
begin calculation to compute the impedance for the entire set
of channels (taking takes several seconds for each electrode).
As a result, the total time to read impedance on all channels
for the B-Alert X10 system can be extremely long, and the
duration of this process is extended every time a channel is
manipulated and must be re-checked. Altogether, it was
universally agreed among the experimenters collecting data
that while the EPOC took the least amount of time and effort
for total setup, and the ActiveTwo cap consistently took the
longest, it was unpredictable whether the B-Alert X10 or

Figure 2. Manufacturer’s stated electrode positions. BioSemi’s

ActiveTwo had 64 recording locations with a recording reference
located near POz and additional recording electrodes placed at the
mastoids. ABM’s B-Alert X10 uses nine recording locations and
reference the electrodes located at the mastoids. QUASAR’s HMS
system has nine recording electrodes, reference predeﬁned as
electrode at location P4, and a ground electrode on the chin (not
shown). Emotiv’s EPOC has 14 recording locations and hardwired
references located at P3/P4 or left and right mastoids (user’s choice).

on concentric rings so that they roughly conform to the scalp.
Thus, the array of electrode pins used by the HMS system is
capable of contacting the scalp through hair. However, the
HMS electrode can become tangled in long, thick hair
resulting in an uncomfortable experience for the wearer and/
or insufﬁcient connectivity. We were unable to establish
sufﬁcient connectivity with the HMS system in one
participant with thick, curly hair, despite success with the
other three systems. As a result, although the HMS is more
convenient for the participant because no liquid residue
remains in their hair, two major trade-offs for the system are
not comfortable to the participant from the twisting of the
sensor in their hair and additional cleaning by the experimenter to remove tangled hair from the unit.
4.4.2. Total setup time.

In addition to the initial application
of the system, the total time to prepare the participant was also
affected by the effort necessary to obtain acceptable electrode
impedance, which indicates the quality of connection with the
scalp. For example, with the HMS unit, even though the
initial time to setup the headset on the participant was very
quick, it often took considerable effort to make strong,

data, instead of using a separate integration box (details of
this have been described in [27]). The HMS uses a simple
TTL pulse to signal that an event occurred, but this does not
permit coding of different event types or classes; as a result,
this solution requires a post-processing step to decode what
event type occurred for each TTL pulse. The timing of data
trigger integration has been covered in depth elsewhere
[27, 28], but the main conclusion from that work is that the
transfer of data into the acquisition PC prior to integration of
event triggers negatively impacts the synchronization of EEG
data with events of interest. This issue was of particular
concern for the EPOC system, which is the only system of the
four discussed here that does not use an external method of
synchronization.

4.4.3. Contact stability over time.

Across all three approaches
in the newer systems, we were pleasantly surprised by the
stability of the connection between the electrodes and the
scalp. Conductive gel (used by both ActiveTwo and B-Alert
X-10) dries out a small amount during the 60 min
experimental session which can result in an itchy sensation
on the scalp for the participant, but it remained conductive
throughout the experiment. The saline-soaked felt pads used
in the EPOC remained damp enough to be conductive
throughout the experiment, although this may be contingent
on the relative humidity of the area where they are being
used. The dry electrode sensors on the HMS system also
maintained their conductivity as long as the headset position
was not adjusted by a head scratch or other manipulation at
the scalp.
As neuroscience moves from the laboratory into more
complex settings, environments that cause a participant to
sweat should increase the durability of scalp-electrode
connections for every connection type. However, for any
ﬂuid conductivity-based system, there is a risk of bridging the
gaps between electrode sites in high-density electrode
systems. Interestingly, sweat may enhance the signal quality
in the pin-array style of dry electrodes by bridging the small
inter-pin distances. Excessive sweating, however, may result
in an electrical bridge between pin arrays identical to the
bridging between electrodes in other systems. Future EEG
systems designs will need to be implemented and tested in
whole-body-movement paradigms and various temperature
environments to examine these real-world recording
considerations.

5. Summary
Recently, several commercial-grade, wireless EEG systems
have been developed that aim to increase the usability of the
neuroimaging technology in real-world settings. We recruited
16 participants to complete a series of cognitive tasks in four
experimental sessions to assess the pros and cons of using
three new wireless EEG systems in comparison with a wired,
laboratory-grade system. BioSemi’s ActiveTwo served as an
established laboratory-grade ‘gold standard’ baseline for a
comparison with three wireless EEG systems: the ABM BAlert X10 system, the Emotiv EPOC system, and the early
QUASAR HMS system. The experimental design for this
comparison study provided both participants and experimenters an opportunity to directly compare the EEG systems,
and the design of each wireless system is discussed in relation
to its inﬂuence on the system’s usability as a potential realworld neuroimaging system.
Only the standard ActiveTwo system has a systematic
approach to accommodate variation in both head size and
shape. The wireless system with the most comparable performance was B-Alert X10 which uses different sizes for the
plastic strip that secures the electrodes and accommodates
variable head sizes; however, this solution was less adaptable
for a range of head shapes. Meanwhile, the ﬂexible sensor
arms on the EPOC and HMS headsets provided the opposite
accommodation—some adaptability for head shape, but not
for head size. Even worse, the ﬂexible arms resulted in
uncomfortable pressure points across participants and undesired movement of the entire unit on the scalp with participant
head rotation. Additionally, participant feedback revealed that
the B-Alert X10 system was preferred overall compared to the
EPOC and HMS systems, and that the B-Alert X10 system
was also rated as signiﬁcantly more comfortable than the
ActiveTwo comparison system.
Experimenter feedback identiﬁed additional usage concerns based on the variation in the system designs. The
intended 10–20 electrode locations of the systems were not
accurate across participants because the ﬁxed inter-electrode
distances could not accommodate variability in head sizes and
shapes. The systems also vary in the coverage of scalp
locations, which may be signiﬁcant for particular tasks if the

4.5. Event integration

Typically for research purposes, EEG is time-locked to an
external event or action to understand the brain’s response to
a speciﬁc activity occurring in the environment. To synchronize the EEG data with experimental tasks, environmental cues, and other sensors, there must be a method for
integrating event triggers with the EEG data. The precision
and reliability of this synchronization can be critical to
properly assessing the neural response, which can vary by
only milliseconds. Each of the systems compared utilizes a
different method for logging event triggers. Some systems use
a parallel data port (ActiveTwo, B-Alert X10) which allows
for logging not only the timing of an event, but permits
coding of different types of events. This is the most common
among conventional laboratory systems, and it is the preferred
method because it simpliﬁes the analysis and prevents mislabeling of event types. In fact, the B-Alert X10 receiver has
connections for two serial inputs as well, greatly increasing
the options available for different devices to synchronize.
EPOC offers a method for recording event triggers over the
serial port, but the timing is highly susceptible to jitter and
delay due to a reliance on the recording PCs operating system
to coordinate with the serial port for integration with the EEG

6. Conclusions and recommendations

brain signal of interest occurs most strongly at an uncovered
location on the scalp. It is important to note that many
manufacturers of wireless EEG systems are actively developing form factors utilizing higher densities of electrodes to
accommodate the requirements of signal decomposition analyses. It is unclear whether increasing the sensor density may
limit the deviation from actual 10–20 locations by reducing
the available space on the scalp. However, the structural
sources of error that result from semi-rigid arms, stretchable
caps, and ﬁxed-distance systems will remain.
All three wireless systems showed good stability in the
signal connectivity over the time period of recording, even
though three different approaches were used for establishing
contact between the electrodes and the scalp. However, the
approaches did differ in their comfort to the user, ease of
setup for the experimenter, and total time for setup. The
current wet designs out-performed the dry design overall in
this respect, even with the clean-up time saved from the lack
of gel. Finally, all systems used slightly different methods for
event synchronization, with the B-Alert X10 overall providing the largest number of options (both parallel and serial
input), and the HMS system having the most limited option
(only a single binary timestamp) which made it necessary to
rely on additional third party event logging and ﬁle synchronization post-hoc (options from the manufacturer have
evolved since the time of testing).
This study highlights the need for ergonomic assessments [37] of neurotechnologies, including a need to deﬁne
quantiﬁable goals for usability of EEG systems to determine
the utility of various design elements for speciﬁc neuroscience applications [4, 6, 9, 10, 38]. This report focused
on ﬁve design elements: (1) adaptability for head size variance, (2) comfort and preference, (3) variance in the
selected scalp locations for the recording electrodes, (4) the
stability of the electrical connectivity, and (5) the integration
between the EEG system and other information. However,
within each of these elements, more systematic study of
usability factors would enhance our knowledge for future
system development efforts. Candidate factors include
measurement of discomfort, in addition to comfort, and how
these ratings evolve over time since a system may be
comfortable for an hour but unbearable for three; recording
the time for each of the setup and clean up steps (prepping
the cap or participant, establishing impedance levels, etc) to
quantify differences among the systems; characterization of
hair types and how they inﬂuence impedance levels and
comfort ratings; additional ergonomic issues, such as
sustainability [39], and their impact on usability; and
establishing thresholds for speciﬁc applications of the
system because a system viable for one use, e.g., seated
in air conditioning, may not be viable for another use, e.g., walking around a heated desert. Future work is needed
to systematically evaluate a host of usability factors
tailored to the speciﬁcs of the intended neuroscience
application.

Out of the three wireless systems tested, participants and
experimenters preferred the approach by ABM on the B-Alert
X10. The gel-infused sticky foam pads were easy to apply
and comfortable to wear. The saline-soaked pads at the end of
semi-rigid ‘ﬁngers’ (EPOC approach) are designed for easy
application and wear, but the semi-rigid ‘ﬁngers’ result in too
much pressure for some larger heads (leading to decreased
comfort over time). In contrast to this, the stretchable-cap
approach by BioSemi leads, which is the more common
method used in most conventional laboratory systems, yielded consistent electrode recording sites, but also requires
effort to setup and clean. Interestingly, the dry electrode, pinarray approach of QUASAR also required effort to apply. The
overall weight of the system was also a problem, leading to
diminished comfort among most participants.
The three new, commercially oriented systems described
here provide important advancements by pushing EEG technology towards wireless solutions and alternative approaches
to establish connectivity between the electrode and the scalp
through hair. Their wireless un-tethered operation makes
them more applicable for use in every-day, less restrictive
scenarios [6]. Thus, they are better suited for studies where
the goal is to monitor neural activity within naturalistic scenarios, where whole body movements, normal social interaction, or minimal disruption to everyday behavior is
necessary [6, 40].
However, this level of freedom and ease of application
comes at the cost of substantially lower channel count, limiting their use to paradigms where high spatial resolution is
not necessary. Additionally, the current, wireless EEG systems still fall short of allowing for comfortable, long-term
wear for a variety of head sizes and hair types. While it is
probable that dry, gel and preparation-free electrode designs
will be needed for more widespread adoption in real-world
settings, additional work must be completed to reﬁne the
current approaches for realistic applications. In particular,
performance criteria regarding speciﬁc design features
affecting usability should be established. Using these as a
guidepost, future designs can then continue to improve on
these advancements and enable ease of use in real-world
environments while still providing the needed consistency in
electrode recording location, synchronization with external
events, comfort and overall wearability of the system for the
participant.
