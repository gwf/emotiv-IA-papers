Abstract:
Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is becoming an emerging problem for
developing countries where there is an increase in expected age. There is no specific curative
therapeutic treatment available for these patients.

t

Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate short and long-term changes in the

ip

electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters and cognition of MCI patients with aerobic exercises.

cr

Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted on 40 patients which were randomly

us

divided into two groups, “aerobic exercise treatment group (n=21)” and “no-aerobic control

an

group (n=19)”. Short-term effects of exercise were measured after single session of exercise and
long-term effects were measured after an 18 sessions (6 weeks) treatment. The outcomes which

M

were measured were, electroenphelogram paramaters (slowness and complexity of the EEG) and

d

cognitive functions (using mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal cognitive

pt
e

assessment (MoCA), and trail making test (TMT) A and B).
Results: After one session of aerobic exercise there were significant improvements in slowness

ce

(delta waves; 0.678+0.035 vs 0.791+0.033; p=0.015) and complexity (0.601+0.051 vs

Ac

0.470+0.042; p=0.027) of the EEG in aerobic exercise treated group as compared to no-aerobic
exercise group. After six weeks there were significant improvements in slowness (delta waves;
0.581+0.036 vs 0.815+0.025; p=0.005) and complexity (0.751+0.045 vs 0.533+0.046; p=0.001)
of the EEG in the aerobic group as compared to no-aerobic group. Moreover, significant
improvements were observed in the MMSE (p=0.032), MoCA (p=0.036), TMT-A (p=0.005) and
TMT-B (p=0.007) in aerobic exercise group as compared to no-aerobic group.

Introduction

cr

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the most rapidly developing problem and affects the elderly

us

population [1]. It is a clinical condition in which people are found to a have minor deficit in
cognitive functions and they also exhibit poor motor control [2]. MCI is a risk factor for

an

developing Alzheimer’s disease and/or dementia [1]. Pakistan is the 6th most populated country
of the world, and 7% of its population is above 60 years [3], and this number is predicted to

M

increase upto 27 million by 2050 [3]. The prevalence of dementia in South Asia is 1.9% which

d

suggests that more than 1.5 million people living in Pakistan suffer from dementia and this

pt
e

number is expected to increase [4, 5]. Besides suffering of the subjects and their families,
dementia also causes a large socioeconomic burden in countries like Pakistan.

ce

MCI is considered as a pre-dementia stage between normal ageing and dementia [6], and 5-15%

Ac

of MCI patients become dementia patients [7]. This suggests that if we can identify, characterize
and control MCI at an early stage, we may be successful in decreasing the number of dementia
cases. Early intervention/attempts to stop MCI may help slow down the progression of MCI.
Exercise is considered as one of the non-pharmacological strategies to increase cognitive
functioning of MCI patients and is also thought to reduce risk factors (sedentary life style).
Several studies have shown that short or acute bouts of aerobic exercise increase attentional
resources during cognitively demanding tasks [8, 9] and performance in executive function
3

(reaction time and attention) [10]. Long-term treatment with aerobic exercise is also known to
improve executive functions (as measured using the trail making test (TMT) B, verbal fluency,
and task switching) but memory does not improve [11]. Previous studies support that exercise
improves cognition of MCI patients, there are still some studies that contradict this notion. Some
studies have shown no improvements in cognitive tasks and executive functions with

ip

t

interventions, such as, multi component exercise [12], functional task exercise [13] and
resistance training [14]. Tai-chi programs also showed no effects on executive functions but it

us

cr

improved memory [15]. Therefore, the type of exercise may be an important factor to consider.
Previous studies have shown that there are three types of exchanges associated with MCI and

an

Alzheimer’s patients: EEG slowness, complexity of the EEG and perturbation in the EEG [16].
The power in low frequency bands (delta 0.5-4 Hz, theta 4-8 Hz) are increased in Alzheimer’s

M

and MCI patients while the power in high frequency bands (alpha 8-14 Hz and beta 14–35 Hz) is

d

decreased [17]. Besides the spectral power, approximate entropy (ApEn) has been used to

pt
e

represent complexity or irregularity in the EEG data [18]. Neurocognitive testing is also used
commonly in these populations. Combining EEG parameters with neurocognitive tests would

ce

provide an in-depth understanding about the mechanisms of any potential effects of an
intervention. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the short and long-term cognitive

Ac

effects of aerobic exercise in MCI patients (effects measured through EEG and neurocognitive
tests). We hypothesize that aerobic exercise will have both short and long-term positive effects
on cognitive function in MCI patients.

Patient recruitment

We selected the subjects from those patients who visited hospital and were diagnosed as MCI

an

patient by a clinical expert. MCI patients (n= 40) were randomly divided into two groups;
aerobic exercise treatment group (n=21) and no-aerobic exercise control group (n= 19). The

M

mean age of the aerobic exercise treated group was 58+2 years, and the control group was 60+3

d

years (Table 1). Patients were diagnosed by applying Mini-mental state examination (MMSE)

pt
e

and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) tests. Keeping in the view the specificity and
sensitivity of MMSE and MoCA [19-21] (mentioned in section: “EEG and neurocognitive

ce

assessments”), MCI patient were diagnosed by these tests which are powerful diagnostic tests

Ac

with substantial accuracy. These tests have been proved valid and reliable tests for screening of
cognitive functions, not only in MCI, as suggested by several studies [19-21], but also in stroke
[22] and Parkinson disease [23]. The inclusion criteria for the patients were: 1) MMSE and
MoCA test’s score < 25 points, 2) the patient could read and write his or her name in Urdu (local
language) and English, 3) physical ability to perform the aerobic exercise plan, 4) adequate
visual and hearing capacity to perform neuropsychological testing, and 5) be able to give verbal
and written consent.
5

The exclusion criteria were:1) cognition problems due to other brain pathologies such as stroke,
brain tumor, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis, and 2) a history of
cardiac disease in the past, epilepsy, any/or any other major diagnosed psychiatric problem, renal
failure, or any other systemic disease (Figure 2). The patients should not be taking any drugs
which could interfere with cognition such as antidepressants, benzodiazepines or other central

ip

t

nervous system agents. Patients having habits of smoking, alcohol and significant disturbances in

cr

sleep were also excluded from the study.

Exercise treatment/intervention protocol

an

Aerobic exercise treatment

The patients were treated individually with exercise using a treadmill and a stationary bicycle in

M

a physical therapy department (Figure 1). The target heart rate of the patient was recorded, and it

d

should be between 60% and 80% of the maximum heart rate based on the Karvonen formula.

pt
e

The intensity of patient exercise was also monitored and calculated from the heart rate by using
Borg’s rating of perceived exertion [24]. Each exercise session consisted of a 5-10 minutes

ce

warm-up period at the beginning and a 5-10 minutes cool-down period at the end. The aerobics
exercise was performed on the stationary bicycle. During the entire exercise session the heart

Ac

rate and oxygen saturation were monitored continuously by a cardiac monitor. Each exercise
session was continued for a pre-determined time, or it was stopped early if the subject’s heart
rate (calculated by Karvonen formula) became too high or they over-exerted themselves
(assessed by Borg’s scale). The EEG recordings were done before and after the first session of
aerobic exercise to measure the short-term effects. The duration of each session of exercise was
aimed to be increased gradually from 20 minutes to 40 minutes, from the first session to the last

6

session; however, this would depend on the heart rate and exertion response of each individual
patient as described above. Aerobic exercise sessions were performed, three days per week by all
the participants for six weeks. EEG, MMSE, MoCA, TMT-A and B were recorded before and
after six weeks of treatment to measure the long-term effects.
No-aerobic exercise control group

ip

t

For the no-aerobic exercise control group, no proper exercise treatment was given. Instead only

cr

gentle movements and general body stretching were advised to perform at their home. It was

us

recommended that each patient should perform these movements three times per week for six
weeks, and follow-up questioning confirmed that this was adhered to. Pre- and post-

an

intervention/control measurements of EEG and neuropsychological testing were performed on

M

these patients as well.

d

EEG and neurocognitive assessments (MMSE, MoCA, TMT-A and TMT-B)

EEG was recorded before and after the first session of aerobic exercise or stretching session and
after six weeks of aerobic exercise training or stretching in both groups. Neurocognitive testing

ce

was done only before and after six weeks of training.

Ac

EEG validation

Emotiv was used to record EEG in this study. To validate the EEG recordings, EEG was
recorded two times on two separate days using the EEG recording protocol described below. The
differences between these two separate recordings were analyzed. Slowness and complexity of
EEG was calculated, in both eyes open and eyes closed state.

7

EEG recordings
EEG was recorded using the Emotiv EPOC® Headset with 14 channels (AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7,
P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, and AF4) and 2 references (according to the International 1020 electrode location system). The data acquisition parameters were: sampling frequency = 128
Hz, resolution 14 bits (1LSB = 0.51μV), bandwidth = 0.2 to 43 Hz (5th order Sinc Filter, 50 Hz

ip

t

notch). All recordings were performed with electrode impedances below 10kΩ in a noise

cr

reduced environment. The total recording time was 2 minutes. During this time the patients
alternated between closed their eyes for 30 seconds and then opened their eyes for 30 seconds

us

based on the experimenter’s instructions. This process was repeated two times. Patients were

an

seated in a chair and were told not to move their hands, eyes and other parts of the body [25-28].

M

MoCA and MMSE

d

For MoCA, the testing procedure was the same as described previously [20, 21] with slight

pt
e

modifications. MoCA is a highly sensitive (80-100%) and specific (56-76%) screening tool for
MCI patients [21]. It consisted of 30 points, which cover eight different domains of cognition:

ce

visuospatial/executive function, naming, verbal memory registration and learning, attention,
abstraction, delayed verbal memory and orientation. Patients with MoCA scores of less than 26,

Ac

are considered as cognitively impaired. The Urdu version of MoCA was used in this study.
For MMSE, the testing procedure was the same described previously [19, 20] with slight
modifications. MMSE is a sensitive (40-60%) and specific (65-90%) tool used for screening of
MCI patients. It also consisted of 30 points, covering different domains of cognition. Patients
with MMSE scores of less than 25 are considered as cognitively impaired [20]. The MoCA and

8

MMSE tests were only applied after six weeks of treatment (and not after a single session to
avoid a potential learning effect).
TMT-A and TMT-B
TMT-A and TMT-B are used to determine the executive functions (processing speed and task

t

switching), and the testing procedure was same described previously [29, 30], with slight

ip

modifications. TMT was performed on a paper using a pen. TMT consists of two sub tests. In

cr

TMT-A, the patient has to connect numbers in a sequence by continuing patterns. In TMT-B, the

us

patient has to draw a line switching between letters of the alphabet and numbers in a correct
sequence. The time to complete both tasks was recorded. A blinded trained therapist for these

an

tests applied tests before and after the intervention/control. The TMT-A and B tests were only

M

applied after six weeks of treatment, and not after a single session to avoid a potential learning

d

effect.

Data processing

To measure the slowness of the EEG signals, average power of the following frequency bands

ce

were calculated: delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta (4–8Hz), alpha1 (8–11 Hz), alpha2 (11–14 Hz), beta1

Ac

(14–25 Hz) and beta2 (25–35 Hz). Calculations of relative band spectra of the above mentioned
bands were performed using Matlab® 2015. The power across frequencies in the specific band
was normalized to the total power in the EEG.
For complexity, the ApEn was calculated and used as a measure of regularity. ApEn is a nonlinear statistically valid formula tool that can quantify their regularity of time series. As
suggested by Pincus [31] we have used an embedding dimension of two and a tolerance of 0.2
times the standard deviation of the original data. The results of the ApEn have been averaged
9

based on all the artifact-free frames/epochs within the two-minute period of EEG recordings,
during eyes open and eyes close state.
Statistics analysis
Data are reported as mean + standard error of mean (SEM). Equipment validation was done by

t

comparison of two readings of EEG at two different times, by using paired t-test. To determine

ip

the effects of aerobic exercise on slowness and complexity of the EEG, a two-way ANOVA was

cr

applied. The factors were “time” (three levels: before treatment, after one session, and after six

us

weeks) and “group” (two levels: aerobic exercise and no-aerobic exercise); this test was repeated
for eyes open, eyes close and each EEG measure separately. Potential significant test statistics

an

were followed up using Scheffe’s post hoc test. Independent t-tests were used to determine

M

differences for MMSE, MoCA, TMT-A and TMT-B between the aerobic exercise group and noaerobic group. The results were considered significant only if the “p” value was less than 0.05.

Discussion

Aerobic exercise due to its potential therapeutic effects represent as an emerging candidate for

ce

MCI subjects. Although, aerobic exercise is one of the main types of exercises, but to our

Ac

knowledge its effects on MCI subjects were not explored on slowness and complexity of EEG,
particularly short and long-term effects in a single study. A pilot study from our lab [32]
encourage us to determine effects of aerobic exercise in MCI patients in detail.

It has been reported that the MCI patient’s EEG becomes progressively slow over time compared
to a healthy individual [33]. Such “slowing” of EEG appears to be a sensitive measure of
changes in cognitive impairment during the early stages of disease progression [33]. Delta waves
13

powers are increased in MCI patients due to loss of cortico-cortical connectivity [34], but the
theta waves are increased due to slowing of subcortical axonal time conduction in MCI Patients
[35]. These findings have been suggested to reflect, or represent indicators, of disease
progression towards Alzheimer’s disease [36]. This loss of cortical connectivity and slowness of
reactivity is due to damage of the cholinergic neurons in lateral capsular pathways and

t

Perisylvian pathways. These pathways have a significant role in cortical activity, and thought to

ip

be responsible for the “readiness” state [37]. These pathways have dense cholinergic fibers [38].

cr

It has been reported previously that exercise increases neurotransmitters, such as, acetylcholine

us

in brain [39]. Different studies suggested that patients of MCI show a decrease in beta bands

an

intensity. Theta and beta bands powers are the earliest detected changes in MCI patients [40, 41].
Moreover, it has been reported that after aerobic exercise, there is a constant increase in BDNF

M

levels up to 60 minutes [42], helping in improved cognitive function by increasing neural
plasticity [43], suggesting the immediate effects of aerobic exercise at molecular level. Other

pt
e

d

studies have consistently shown that a single bout of physical exercise enhances neuroplasticity
[44, 45]. Aerobic stationary bicycling for 30 minutes increases attentional processing and

ce

plasticity among frontal, central and parietal midline brain areas [46]. Along with this, aerobic
exercise can improve perfusion of various parts of the brain [47, 48]. These above mentioned

Ac

studies have given clear indication about the immediate effects of exercise on brain. Therefore,
the aerobic exercise conducted in our study is likely to have immediate effects in the form of
increased levels of acetylcholine, BDNF and cerebral blood flow, which may have caused
significant improvement in delta, theta and beta bands after single session and 6 weeks of aerobic
exercise treatment.

14

In the present study the focus was also to determine effect of aerobic exercise on the complexity
of EEG. There are various measures one can use to determine the complexity of EEG, including
sample entropy [49], ApEn [31], auto-mutual information [50] and Lempel – Zev complexity
[51, 52]. In the current study complexity of EEG was measured by ApEn, as this is widely
accepted for the diagnosis of cognitive impaired patients [31, 53]. Electrophysiological

parameters within the cerebral cortex of Alzheimer’s patients are more regular as compared to
healthy individuals [53], although the exact mechanism for this regularity is not clear [16].

cr

Neuronal death and loss of neurotransmitter activity have both been suggested as reasons for

us

more regularity or reduced complexity of EEG in Alzheimer’s patients [16, 54]. It has been

an

reported previously that exercise increases neuronal plasticity by up-regulating neuronal cell
proliferation programs, increasing cerebral blood flow, increasing the permeability of the blood-

M

brain barrier [48], due to angiogenesis and by increasing the number of neurons in transient stage
[55, 56]. Our results reveal that aerobic exercises increased the complexity of EEG, not only in

pt
e

d

the short-term but also as a long-term effect. Previously, it is reported that acute exercises (shortterm effects) activates the prefrontal cortex, as there is a direct relationship between cognitive

ce

control and oxygenation of prefrontal cortex during exercise [57]. Another study has reported
that short bouts of exercise also increase neurophysiological changes, with the key factor being

Ac

the intensity of the exercise, while exercise duration showed no significant difference [58]. The
increased complexity of the EEG observed in the current study following exercise therefore
appears to have a positive effect of exercise. It may in the future also be used as a prognostic
indicator.
As part of the neurocognitive tests utilized in this study the MoCA, MMSE, TMT-A and B were
performed to assess specific executive functions such as visual search, movement speed and
15

cognitive alteration [29, 59]. Executive functions are compromised or decrease in MCI and
Alzheimer’s patients [29]. As the brain ages its reactivity integrative ability is thought to
decrease. This has for example been shown with decreased values of clustering coefficients
(small world index) and path length in older adults as compared to young people [60]. The
current study supports these previous findings and extends our knowledge in relation to MCI

ip

t

patients, as it showed that aerobic exercise improved several domains of cognition, such as,
alternating trail making, visuo-constructional skills, naming, memory, attention, sentence

cr

repetition, verbal fluency, abstraction and delayed recall, as measured by neurocognitive tests.

us

The results of the current study also support another study that found that aerobic exercise

an

improves executive functions [11], behavior performance and cognitive controls. However, such
effects have so far only been measured in healthy individuals after three days of exercise [58].

M

Previously it is reported that physical exercise provide enriched environments, and therefore
improves and promotes neurogenesis and synaptogenesis within the hippocampus [55, 56, 61]

pt
e

d

that prevents the deterioration in brain function and cognition of MCI patients.
Limitations and other considerations

ce

Medication can have multiple side effects and their therapeutic effects may take an extended
period of time to eventuate [62]. It is therefore not possible to exclude some medication

Ac

confounding effects may have occurred in the current study. It is also important to keep in mind
that physical activity not only improves cognitive function, but it is also known to provide other
health benefits, like positive effects on depression [63], improvement of quality of life [64],
decreased risk of falls [65], improved cardiovascular function [66] and decrease disability [67].
Although exercise is non-invasive and is usually without side effects, it should still be planned
and carried out under supervision by a trained individual because specific exercises may be
16

needed for specific individuals, and exercise has the potential to cause damage in certain cases
where patients have cardiovascular diseases [68]. An individualized exercise program is
recommended, as for example, acute effects of high intensity aerobic exercise is known to
decrease executive functions [69]. The sample size of this study was limited, thus the reader
should interpret the findings with caution. There were also some drop outs that may have

ip

t

influenced the current findings. Future studies should include a larger sample size. Future studies
should also consider using more advanced EEG equipment to determine the mechanism and inter

us

cr

segment pathways of different parts of brain.

an

Conclusion

An important finding of this study was that cognitive impairment associated with age not only

M

slowed down but it could also be improved with aerobic exercises. This aerobic activity could be
performed on a stationary bicycle, treadmill or both. This intervention could be given in any

pt
e

d

setting, ranging from rehabilitation centers to the home of the individual. It could be concluded
that mild to moderate aerobic exercise has both short and long-term positive effects in MCI

ce

patients.
