Abstract
Neuromarketing has become an academic and commercial area of interest, as the advancements in neural recording techniques and interpreting algorithms have made it an effective tool for recognizing the unspoken response
of consumers to the marketing stimuli. This article presents the very first systematic review of the technological
advancements in Neuromarketing field over the last 5 years. For this purpose, authors have selected and reviewed a
total of 57 relevant literatures from valid databases which directly contribute to the Neuromarketing field with basic
or empirical research findings. This review finds consumer goods as the prevalent marketing stimuli used in both
product and promotion forms in these selected literatures. A trend of analyzing frontal and prefrontal alpha band signals is observed among the consumer emotion recognition-based experiments, which corresponds to frontal alpha
asymmetry theory. The use of electroencephalogram (EEG) is found favorable by many researchers over functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in video advertisement-based Neuromarketing experiments, apparently due to
its low cost and high time resolution advantages. Physiological response measuring techniques such as eye tracking,
skin conductance recording, heart rate monitoring, and facial mapping have also been found in these empirical studies exclusively or in parallel with brain recordings. Alongside traditional filtering methods, independent component
analysis (ICA) was found most commonly in artifact removal from neural signal. In consumer response prediction and
classification, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
have performed with the highest average accuracy among other machine learning algorithms used in these literatures. The authors hope, this review will assist the future researchers with vital information in the field of Neuromarketing for making novel contributions.

1 Introduction
Neuromarketing, an application of the non-invasive
brain–computer interface (BCI) technology, has emerged
as an interdisciplinary bridge between neuroscience and
marketing that has changed the perception of marketing research. Marketing is the channel between product and consumers which determines the ultimate sale.

Without effective marketing, a good product fails to
inform, engage and sustain its targeted audiences [1].
The expanding economy with new businesses is continuously evolving with changing consumer preferences. It
is hard for the businesses to grow and sustain without
having quantitative or qualitative assessment from their
consumers. Newly launched products need even more
effective marketing to successfully enter into a competitive market. However, traditional marketing renders
only by posteriori analysis of consumer response. Conventional market research depends on surveys, focus

group discussion, personal interviews, field trials and
observations for collecting consumer feedback [2]. These
approaches have the limitations of time requirement,
high cost and unreliable information, which can often
produce inaccurate results. In contrast to the traditional
marketing research techniques, Neuromarketing allows
capturing consumers’ unspoken cognitive and emotional
response to various marketing stimuli and can forecast
consumers’ purchase decisions.
Neuromarketing uses non-invasive brain signal recording techniques to directly measure the response of a
customer’s brain to the marketing stimuli, superseding the traditional survey methods [3]. Functional magnetic resonance (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG),
magnetoencephalography (MEG), transcranial magnetic stimulator (TMS), positron emission tomography
(PET), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) etc.
are some examples of neural recording devices used in
Neuromarketing research. By obtaining neuronal activity from the brain using these devices, one can explore
the cognitive and emotional responses (i.e., like/dislike,
approach/withdrawal) of a customer. Different stimuli
trigger associated response in a human brain and the
response can be tracked by monitoring the change in
neuronal signals or brainwaves [4]. Further, the signal
and image processing techniques and machine learning
algorithms have enabled the researchers to measure, analyze and interpret the possible meanings of brainwaves.
This opens a new door to detect, analyze and predict
the buying behavior of customers in marketing research.
Now with the help of brain–computer interface, the mental states of a customer, i.e., excitement, engagement,
withdrawal, stress, etc., while experiencing a marketing stimuli can be captured [5]. Besides these brain signal recording techniques, Neuromarketing also utilizes
physiological signals, i.e., eye tracking, heart rate and
skin conductance measurements to gather the insight of
audience’s physiological responses due to encountering
stimuli. These neurophysiological signals with advanced
spectral analysis and machine learning algorithms can
now provide nearly accurate depiction of consumers’
preferences and likes/dislikes [6–8].
Early years of Neuromarketing generated a controversy between the academician and the marketers due
to its high promises and lack of groundwork. From
the claim of peeping into the consumer mind to finding the buy buttons of human brain, Neuromarketing
has long been under the scrutiny of the academicians
and researchers [9, 10]. However, academic research in
this field has started to pile up and the scope of Neuromarketing to reveal and predict consumer behavior is
gradually becoming evident. Neuromarketing Science
and Business Association (NMSBA) was established

Page 2 of 19

in 2012 to bridge the gap between academicians and
Neuromarketers, and it is promoting Neuromarketing research across the world with its annual event of
Neuromarketing World Forum [11, 12]. It may be proposed that further dialogue may continue under such a
platform for further industry–academia collaboration.
Evidently, more than 150 consumer neuroscience companies are commercially operating across the globe and
big brands (Google, Microsoft, Unilever, etc.) are using
their insights to impact their consumers in a tailored and
efficient way. Academic research, especially the high analytical accuracy from the engineering part of Neuromarketing has garnered this breakthrough and acceptance
over the world. Hence, reviewing the building blocks of
Neuromarketing is essential to evaluate its scopes and
capacities, and to contribute new perspective in this
field. Numerous literature reviews have been published
focusing the theoretical aspect of consumer neuroscience, such as marketing, business ethics, management,
psychology, consumer behavior, etc. [13–15]. However,
systematic literature review from the engineering perspective with a focus on neural recording tools and interpretational methodologies used in this field is absent. In
this regard, our article sets its premises to answer the following questions:
– What are the types of marketing stimuli currently
being used in Neuromarketing?
– What are the brain regions activated by these marketing stimuli?
– What is the best brain signal recording tool currently
being used in Neuromarketing research?
– How are these brain signals preprocessed for further
analysis?
– And what are the current methods or techniques
used to interpret these brain signals?
These questions will allow us to gain a comprehensive
knowledge on the up-to-date research scopes and techniques in consumer neuroscience. After this brief introduction, our methodology of conducting this systematic
review will be presented, followed by the state-of-the-art
findings corresponding to the aforementioned questions
and synthesis of the important results. We concluded this
review with relevant inference from synthesized result
and a recommendation for future researchers.

2 Methodology
The systematic literature review is a process in which
a body of literature is collected, screened, selected,
reviewed and assessed with a pre-specified objective for
the purpose of unbiased evidence collection and to reach
an impartial conclusion [16]. Systematic review has the

Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.

obligation to explicitly define its research question and to
address inclusion–exclusion criteria for setting the scope
of the investigation. After exhaustive search of existing
literatures, articles should be selected based on their relevance, and the results of the selected studies must be
synthesized and assessed critically to achieve clear conclusions [16].
In this systematic review, we would like to explore
the marketing stimuli used in Neuromarketing research
articles over the last 5 years with their triggered brain
regions. We would also like to focus on the technological tools used to capture brain signals from these regions,
and finally deliberate on signal processing and analytical
methodologies used in these experiments.
Therefore, the inclusion criteria defined here are as
follows:
– Literatures must be published in the field of Neuromarketing from 2015 to 2019.
– Studies must use brain–computer interface and/or
other physiological signal recording device in their
Neuromarketing experiments.
– Studies must have experimental findings from neural and/or biometric data used in Neuromarketing
research.
The exclusion criteria for this review are set as:
– Any other literature review on Neuromarketing are
excluded from this review.
– Book chapters are excluded from this review. Since
Neuromarketing is comparatively a new research
field, alongside relevant academic journal articles,
book chapters conducting empirical experiments
using BCI can only be included.
– Literatures written/published in any language other
than English are excluded from this article.
To serve the purpose of this systematic literature
review, a total of 931 articles were found across the

internet by using the search item “Neuromarketing”
and “Neuro-marketing” in valid databases. Among the
screened publications, Table 1 presents the database
source of selected 57 research articles including book
chapters, which directly contribute to the Neuromarketing field with basic or empirical research findings.
As for the aggregation of relevant existing literatures,
the researchers defined that the search for articles would
be performed in six databases—Science Direct, Emerald Insight, Sage, IEEE Xplore, Wiley Online Library,
and Taylor Francis Online. After the initial article accumulation, the articles were exhaustively screened by
the authors by reviewing their title, abstract, keywords
and scope to match the objective of this research. Once
the studies met our aforementioned inclusion criteria,
they were selected for further review and critical analysis. Table 2 classifies the selected articles in terms of the
aforementioned dimensions.
By exploring the articles selected to develop this systematic review, it was possible to successfully categorize
the trends and advancements in Neuromarketing field in
following dimensions:
i. Marketing stimuli used in Neuromarketing
research
ii. Activation of the brain regions due to marketing
stimuli
iii. Neural response recording techniques
iv. Brain signal processing in Neuromarketing
v. Machine learning applications in Neuromarketing.
Some of these Neuromarketing studies have used
eye tracking, heart rate, galvanic skin response, facial
action coding, etc., with or without brain signal
recording techniques to gauge the consumer’s hidden
response. As they are the response from autonomous
nervous system (ANS), they have proven themselves
as successful means of exploring consumer’s focus,
arousal, attention and withdrawal actions. Hence, this
study includes articles those empirically used these

3 Systematic review on the advancements
of Neuromarketing
Neuromarketing research utilizes marketing strategies in
the form of stimuli, and aims to invoke, capture and analyze activities occurring in different brain regions while

Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.

(2020) 7:10

subjects experience these stimuli. To conduct a systematic review on this matter, it is important to recall the
interconnection between brain functions with human
behavior and actions triggered by the external stimuli.
The knowledge of brain anatomy and the physiological functions of brain areas as well as the physiological
response due to external stimuli along with it, makes
it possible to model brain activity and predict hidden
response. For this purpose, current neural imaging systems and neural recording systems have contributed
much to capture the true essence of consumer preferences. This section will discuss the marketing stimuli,
their targeted brain regions, neural and physiological
signal capturing technologies used over the last 5 years
in Neuromarketing research. Comparing these signals
with their associated anatomical functionality some studies have already reached high accuracy. A number of the
selected studies have used machine learning techniques
to predict like/dislike and possible preference from the
test subjects.
For the purpose of Neuromarketing experiments, the
following literatures selected right-handed participants,
with normal or corrected-to-normal vision, free of central nervous system influencing medications and with no
history of neuropathology.
3.1 Marketing stimuli used in Neuromarketing

As Neuromarketing is a focus of marketers and consumer
behavior researchers, different strategies from marketing have been applied in Neuromarketing and they are
being investigated for quantitative assessment from neurological data. Nemorin et al. asserts that Neuromarketing differentiates from any other marketing models as
it bypasses the thinking procedures of consumers and
directly enters their brain [74]. Over the last 5 years,
Neuromarketing stimuli has been mainly in two forms—
products with/without price, and promotions. Product
can be defined as physical object or service that meets
the consumer demand. In Neuromarketing, product can
be physical such as tasting a beverage to conceptual like
a 3D (three dimensional) image of the product. Price in
Neuromarketing experiments is mostly seen as a stimuli
is most of the time intermingled with product or promotion. However, it plays an important role that determines the decision of test subjects to buy or not to buy
the product [75].
Consumer response to a product has been recognized
by either physically experiencing the product or by visualizing the image of it. To understand the user esthetics
of 3D shapes, Chew et al. [17], used virtual 3D bracelet
shapes in motion and recorded the brain response of
test subjects with EEG with motion. As 3D visualization of objects for preference recognition is a new area

Page 5 of 19

of research, the authors used mathematical model (Gielis superformula) to create 3D bracelet-like objects.
Their study displayed 3D shapes appear like bracelets as
the product to subjects. Using the 3D shapes gave the
authors an advantage to produce as many of 60 bracelet
shapes to conduct the research on. Another new product was the E-commerce products presented to the test
subjects by Yadava et al. and Çakar et al. [18, 34]. Yadava
et al. proposed a predictive modeling framework to
understand consumer choice towards E-commerce products in terms of “likes” and “dislikes” by analyzing EEG
signals. In showing E-commerce product, they showed a
total of 42 product images to the test participants. These
product images were mainly of apparels and accessory
items such as shirts, sweaters, shoes, school bags, wrist
watches, etc. The test participants were asked to disclose
their preference in terms of likes and dislikes after viewing the items [18]. Çakar et al. used both product and
price to explore the experience during product search of
first-time buyers in E-commerce. To motivate the participants, this research provided each participants around
73 USD as a gift card to use during the experiment. The
test participants were asked to search and select three
products of their interest from an e-commerce website
and reach the maximum of their gift card limit to activate. Test subjects often experienced negative emotion
while being unable to find necessary buttons such as “add
to cart” or “sorting options” [34]. These Neuromarketing
experiments on E-commerce products may help developers to build better user experience. Retail businesses lose
large amount of money when they invest in the wrong
product. Among retail products, shoes have thousands
of blueprints for manufacturing. Producing thousands
of shoes of different designs to satisfy consumers can be
laborious and unprofitable since a large number of the
designs turn out to be failures. Baldo et al. directly used
30 existing image of shoe designs to show the test subjects to and to choose from a mock shop showing on the
screen [39]. EEG signals were recorded during the whole
shoe selection time and then subjects were asked to rate
the shoes in a rank of 1 to 5 of Likert scale. This experiment helped realize brain response-based prediction can
supersede self-report-based methods, as the simulation
on sales data showed 12.1% profit growth for surveybased prediction, and 36.4% profit growth for the brain
response-based prediction.
Similar to the shoe experiment, Touchette and Lee [21]
experimented on the choice of apparel products among
young adults, based on Davidson’s frontal asymmetry
theory. EEG signals were recorded while 34 college students viewed three attractive and three unattractive
apparel products on a high-resolution computer screen
in a random order. Pozharliev et al. [20] experimented

Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.

(2020) 7:10

on the emotion associated with visualizing luxury brand
products vs. regular brand products. The experiment displayed 60 luxury items and 60 basic brand items to 40
female undergraduate students to recognize the brain
response of seeing high emotional value (luxury) products in social vs. alone atmosphere. The study found
that, luxury brand products invoked a higher emotional
value in social atmosphere which could be utilized by the
marketers. Bosshard et al. and Fehse et al. experimented
on brand images and the comparison between the brain
responses associated with preferred and not preferred
brands [32, 33]. In the study performed by Bosshard et al.,
consumer attitude towards established brand names were
measured via electroencephalography. Subjects were
shown 120 brand names in capital white letter in Tahoma
font on black background and without any logo while
their brain responses were recorded. On the other hand,
Fehse et al. compared the brain response of test subjects
while they visualized blocks of popular vs. organic food
brand logos. These experiments on brand image may help
marketers to recognize the implicit response of consumers on different types of branding.
As price is mentioned as an important factor that
determines the user’s interest on purchasing a product,
a number of Neuromarketing studies have used price
alongside the products. In the aforementioned study
by Çakar et al. [34] price was displayed while recording
brain response during first-time e-commerce user experience. Marques et al. [22], Çakir et al. [24], Gong et al.
[35], Pilelienė and Grigaliūnaitė [36], Hsu and Chen [26],
Boccia et al. [37], Venkatraman et al. [38], and Baldo et al.
[39] have included price as a marketing stimuli with the
product or promotional.
An interesting concept was tried by Boccia et al. to
recognize the relation between corporate social responsibilities and consumer behavior. The author attempted
to identify if consumers were willing to pay more for the
products from socially or environmentally responsible
company. Consumers were found to prefer the conventional companies over the socially responsible companies
due to lesser price. Marques et al. [22] investigated the
influence of price to compare national brand vs. ownlabeled branded products. In the experiment of Çakir
et al, product then product and price were shown to
the subjects before decision-making time and the brain
responses were recorded through fNIRS [24]. Sometimes
price can play a passive role in the form of discounts or
gifts in a promotional. Gong et al. innovatively designed
an experiment to compare consumer brain response
associated with promotional using discount (25% off ) vs.
gift-giving (gift value equivalent to the discount) marketing strategies. Their study found that lower degree of
ambiguity (e.g., discounts) better motivates consumer

Page 6 of 19

decision-making [35]. Hsu and Chen used price as a control variable in their wine tasting experiment. As price
plays a pivotal role in purchase decision, two wines were
selected of approximately equal price $15. Then the EEG
signals of test subjects were recorded during the wine
tasting session [26].
Promotion is the communication from the marketers’
end to influence the purchase decision of consumers [75].
In Neuromarketing research, promotion is usually found
as the TV commercials and short movies for advertisement. One of the key focus of Neuromarketers is to
evaluate the consumer engagement of advertisements.
Predicting the engagement of advertisements before
broadcasting them on air, ensures higher rate of successful promotions.
In 2015, Yang et al. used six smartphone commercials
of different brands to compare among them in terms
of extract cognitive neurophysiological indices such as
happiness, surprise, and attention as well as behavioral indices (memory rate, preference, etc.) [41]. A common experimental design procedure is found among the
promotion-based Neuromarketing experiments, that is
subjects are first made comfortable in the experimental
setting, consecutive advertisements were placed at a time
distance no shorter than 10 s and consecutive advertisements used neutral stimuli such as white screen, green
scenario, blank in between them to stabilize the test
participants.
The Neuromarketing experiments of Soria Morillo
et al. [40, 43] tried to find out the electrical activity of
audience brain while viewing advertisement relevant to
audiences’ taste. They display used 14 TV commercials
displayed to their 10 test subjects for their experiment
and predicted like or dislike response from audience
with the help of advanced algorithms. Cherubino et al.
[42] investigated cognitive and emotional changes of
cerebral activity during the observation of TV commercials among different aged population. Among seven TV
commercials displayed during the experiment, one commercial with strong images was analyzed for the adults’
and older adults’ reaction. Other than them, Vasiljević
et al. [44] used Nestle advertisement to measure consumer attention though pulse analysis; Daugherty et al.
[46] replicated an experiment of Krugman (1971) using
both TV advertisements and print media advertisements to recognize how consumers look and think; Royo
et al. [47] focused on consumer response while viewing
advertisements of sustainable product designs. For their
experiment, an animated commercial was made containing verbal narrative of sustainable product and an existing commercial was used to convey the visual narrative
of conventional product. Venkatraman et al. focused
on measuring the success of TV advertisements using

Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.

(2020) 7:10

neuroimaging and biometric data [38]. Randolph and
Pierquet [51] showed super bowl commercials to undergraduate students to compare the class rank of the commercials and the neural response from the test subjects.
Nomura and Mitsukura [52] identified emotional states
of audiences while watching favorable vs. unfavorable TV
commercials. They selected 100 TV commercials among
which 50 commercials were award winning which were
labeled as favorable advertisements. Singh et al. [56] used
promotion in the form of static vs. video advertisements
to predict the success of omnichannel marketing strategies. Ungureanu et al. [53] measured user attention and
arousal by eye tracking while surfing through web page
containing static advertisements, while Goyal and Singh
[54] utilized facial biometric sensors to model an automated review systems for video advertisements. Oon
et al. [55] used merchandise product advertisement clips
to recognize user preference. Singh et al. [56] used video
advertisements to measure visual attentions of audiences.
Most of the TVC (television commercials) in these literatures had a standard time of 30 s. In Neuromarketing,
these TVCs were displayed in between other videos such
as documentary film, gaming video, drama, etc., to capture the true response of consumers.
Sometimes Neuromarketing is observed dealing with
advertisement of different purposes, such as social advertisements or gender-related advertisements. The application of Neuromarketing in social advertisement is to
predict the success of these ads to reach its messages to
the targeted social groups [45, 49, 69]. Chen et al. [49]
experimented on the neural response of adolescent audiences while they are exposed to e-cigarette commercials.
Another social advertisement stimuli of smoking cessation frames was used by Yang [45], to understand what
types of frames (positive/negative) achieve better attention from smokers and non-smokers. Gender plays a
substantial role in advertisement industry from celebrity
endorsement to gender-targeted marketing. Missaglia
et al. [69] conducted a research on fast marketed consumer goods (FMCG) advertisements with celebrity vs.
non-celebrity female spokesperson. Casado-Aranda et al.
[50] worked on gender-targeted advertisements using
congruent vs. incongruent product–voice combination.
These studies show us the diversity of marketing stimuli
for future Neuromarketing applications.
3.2 Activation of brain regions due to marketing stimuli

Human brain is a matter of profound astonishment.
The anatomical development of our brain resulted in
the complex web of cognitive and emotional process we
experience every day. The evolution of vertebrate brain
was initially proposed by Paul D. MacLean in his Triune Brain model [76]. In his hypothesis, evolution of

Page 7 of 19

vertebrate brain is formed through three phases. First
the reptilian complex, which indicates the association
of instincts with the anatomical structure basal ganglia. The paleomammalian complex consists of septum, amygdalae, hypothalamus, hippocampal complex,
and cingulate cortex as the limbic system. These organelles were associated with motivation and emotional
response of mammalian brain. Finally, neomammalian
complex consists of cerebral neocortex or the outer
layer of advanced mammalian brain, which is particularly a unique feature of human brain. In the cerebral
neocortex, we find four lobes which control our sensory, motor, emotional and cognitive processes [76].
The triune brain model has been rejected by new neuroscientists due to the interconnectivity of human brain
structures and their function. However, the anatomical
structure of human brain explained by this theory plays
a vital role in recognizing cognitive, emotional and
behavioral process.
Understanding the anatomy of human brain has
showed itself indispensable in Neuromarketing
research, as its functionality is deeply associated with
the interpretation of neural response. The outer layer of
the human brain is a complex system organized in four
lobes, namely (frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital
lobes), each having distinct functionalities for cognitive, emotional, and motor responses. The frontal lobe
is the region where most of our thoughts and conscious
decisions are made [77]. Cognitive decision-making
mainly takes part in the prefrontal region of this lobe,
and movement-related decisions are made in the end
part of frontal lobe. Information about taste, touch and
movement is processed by the parietal lobe. The occipital lobe is the primary center for visual processing,
and the temporal lobe is responsible for visual memories, auditory recognition and integrating new sensory
information with memories [78]. Besides the primary
lobes, cerebral cortex brain anatomy has gyri and sulci
which create the folded appearance of the brain. The
gyri functions on increasing surface area for information processing. Alongside the primary lobes, gyri of
these lobes can be considered as the region of interest
(ROI) in neural imaging techniques [79].
Deeper structures of the human brain consisting thalamus, amygdalae, etc., produces sensory and
instinctual responses which are later transported to
the cerebral cortex. Hypothalamus works as the master
control of our autonomic system. Sleep, hunger, thirst,
blood pressure, body temperature, sexual arousal are
controlled and regulated by hypothalamus. Thalamus
on the other hand regulates sensory information, attention and memory. Amygdalae originate our emotional

Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.

(2020) 7:10

response and hippocampus is the mainframe of our
memory [77].
Retrieving information from brain requires diverse
types of methodology. In Neuromarketing experiments,
different parts of brain are selected for retrieving distinct information. An experiment which solely focuses
on attention might only look at the signals from frontal
lobe, whereas experiments focusing on buyer’s motivation might want to look at deeper structures [38].
According to Soria Morillo et al., brain signal acquisition may capture neural signals either from cerebral cortex or from the deeper layer of the brain [40, 43]. Their
experiment on TV advertisement liking recognition initially uses information only from prefrontal cortex using
a single electrode EEG device. Their experiment showed,
it is possible to classify like/dislike with information collected solely from frontal lobe.
Similarly, Cherubino et al. emphasized on the significance of frontal cortex (FC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC)
in Neuromarketing studies. PFC processes the conscious
and unconscious cognitive and emotional information.
Hence, devices using only a single sensor select PFC as
their signal acquisition region [42]. Also, ventromedial
prefrontal cortex corresponds to motivational behaviors,
imaging of which by fMRI or MEG can reveal purchase
motivations [22].
Neural communication in the brain is conducted
through the action potentials, or the firing of neurons [80]. A neuronal signal is the electrochemical
information that neurons send to each other. These
information are acquired as signals of non-linear pattern called the brainwaves [80]. These brainwaves are
further associated with the neural signature of brain
states. The neural signature is divided into frequency
bands known as rhythms, such as the delta (0.1–4 Hz),
theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), beta (12–30 Hz), and
gamma (30–90 Hz). These frequency bands are related
to different brain states, regions, functions or pathologies. Delta (δ) waves are characteristic of deep sleep and
have not been explored for BCI applications [81]. Theta
(θ) waves are enhanced during sleep in adults and often
related to various brain disorders. During wakefulness
under relaxed conditions alpha (α) waves with moderate amplitude appear spontaneously. Beta (β) waves have
less amplitude and are strongly related to motor control
and engagement or decision-making procedure. Gamma
(γ) waves are associated with movement-related activity of the brain and intensely observed in invasive neural
recording [81].
In Neuromarketing, beta wave amplitudes are associated with reward processing which can further predict
success of a product or TVC (Boksem and Smitds) [57].

Frontal alpha asymmetry is a key concept of hemisphere-based like–dislike classification approach.
When the brain is considered as two hemispheres, left
and right frontal cortices show hemispheric asymmetry in their activation during processing positive and
negative emotion. Another term for emotional engagement, Approach–Withdrawal Index refers to the emotional response from Frontal Alpha Asymmetry theory
[34]. Frontal Asymmetry Index is a marker of approach
and avoidance. “Emotional Engagement” in Neuromarketing is expressed as the power of specific frequency
bands from left and right frontal regions. The F3/F4 and
F7/F8 electrodes are the best candidates for these EEG
power reception as they are positioned at the most sensitive places (International 10–20 System). The alpha
frequency band (8–12 Hz) is commonly used in the
frontal alpha asymmetry theory. However, as the alpha
activity corresponds with relaxation and meditation, it
is negatively correlated with cognitive engagement.
Frontal Asymmetry Index is measured from the
equation:

Frontal Asymmetry Index
Alpha Power of Right F4 or F8
.
= ln
Alpha Power of Left F3 or F7
Higher the Frontal Asymmetry Index value, the more
approach response is obtained from the test subjects
and vice versa. This high or positive asymmetry score
can determine pleasant feeling of a test subject and vice
versa, which was explored in the study conducted by
Touchette and Lee [21].
Neuroimaging and neural signal recording devices
use these locations and brain states to map the mind of
a consumer. A standard 10–20 system has been established, which is an internationally recognized method
to apply the EEG sensors or electrodes on a human
scalp. EEG electrodes under 10–20 system have letters to express their location on skull such as prefrontal (Fp), frontal (F), temporal (T), parietal (P), occipital
(O), and central (C). Even number of electrodes are
placed on the right side of the head.
On the other hand, a test subject is placed inside an
fMRI machine where the activities of the cortices can
be recorded from the hemodynamic response or blood
oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) imaging process.
fMRI can look deeper within the spatial range from
millimeters to centimeters. This enables Neuromarketing researchers using fMRI imaging to examine the
response at putamen, thalamus, amygdalae and even in
the hippocampus.
Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
is another new brain imaging tool which uses the

Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.

(2020) 7:10

hemodynamic responses associated with neuronal
activities [24, 60]. However, fNIRS has a lower spatial
resolution than fMRI and cannot look deeper than 4 cm.
Alongside brain regions associated with neural
response, the human has a peripheral system which
corresponds to cognitive and emotional processes. Eye
movement, skin conductance, heart rate, facial expression all are result of neural processes. Eye tracking is
primarily considered as the physiological response in
consumer neuroscience, however studies have suggested
eye tracking as a result of activation of the visual cortex
or a secondary neural response [34, 36, 38, 53, 70].
Neuromarketing experiments focused on the affect–
circumflex coordinate or valance–arousal coordinate use
autonomic nervous system (ANS) response from sweat
glands of hands or galvanic skin response (GSR), and cardiovascular measure or heart rate (HR). GSR is viewed as
a sensitive and convenient measure for indexing changes
in sympathetic arousal associated with emotion, cognition and attention. On the other hand, HR correlates with
the emotional valence of a stimulus, e.g., the positive or
negative component of the emotion [34].
Considering the available regions to capture signals
from, it is highly likely that Neuromarketing will exponentially improve its recognition and predictions in user
response and preferences.
3.3 Neural response recording techniques

The groundwork in Neuromarketing field is evidently
indebted to the advancement of neuroimaging and neural recording tools. Neurophysiological tools, such as
electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI), eye tracking, skin conductance, heart rate, etc., made it feasible to conduct the academic and commercial Neuromarketing research. Many
research-grade neurophysiological and biometric signal
capturing devices are now available in the market. However, some devices have cost and mobility advantages
over the others and therefore replacing the expensive and
immobile devices for Neuromarketing purpose.
Among all neuroimaging devices, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been the most
widely used neuroimaging technique in Neuromarketing research during the initial time of consumer
neuroscience. The reason behind the wide acceptance
of fMRI is that it offers the identification of cerebral
regions associated with cognitive and emotional process. Combining magnetic field and radio waves, fMRI
produces a sequence of images of the cerebral activity by measuring the blood flow of the cerebral cortex [38]. The signal imaged in fMRI is called BOLD
(blood oxygen level dependent) signal. This technology also allows 3D views of the coordinates that denote

Page 9 of 19

certain location, making possible to investigate deeper
brain structures [57]. The primary disadvantages of
this method are that it is very expensive and till now
has a poor temporal resolution. The computer screen
used in fMRI refreshes the image every 2 to 5 s. This
low temporal resolution to the order of seconds due to
the time requirement of the cerebral blood flow’s increment after being exposed to the stimuli, makes fMRI
unsuitable for tracking brain activities to the order of
milliseconds, which is required in video advertisement
analysis. Other disadvantage is the head of the subject
must remain static during the whole image recording
process [62]. This restriction causes complex preprocessing and movement-related artifact removal from the
fMRI signals. A number of studies, i.e., Venkatraman
et al. [38], Marques et al. [22], Hubert et al. [25], Hsu
and Cheng [26], Chen et al. [49], Casado-Aranda et al.
[50], Wang et al. [30], Wolfe et al. [31], Fehse et al. [33],
etc., have used fMRI as the neuroimaging technique
in their Neuromarketing studies. fMRI in all studies
required the test subjects to remain static and displayed
the subjects the images and commercials of products
for 3–5 s. Later the subjects had to make purchase decision within 5 s after their exposure to the stimuli [50].
Researchers over the last 5 years are found using 3-T
fMRI scanner 3.0-T Siemens Magnetom Trio system
MRI Scanner equipped with a 32-channel bridge head
coil (Hubert and Hsu and Cheng) [25, 62] and 3 Tesla
Siemens Verio scanner (Wang et al. [30]). Cost of an
fMRI machine can be from $500,000 to $3 million varying on its spatiotemporal resolution.
Alongside fMRI, electroencephalography (EEG) is
another popular tool used in Neuromarketing research.
Number of research in Neuromarketing using EEG
devices is increasing due to EEG’s cost efficiency high
temporal resolution and mobility advantages. The EEG
measures electrical activity in the cerebral cortex, the
outer layer of the brain. EEG devices are placed following the 10–20 system. According to the 10–20 system,
the 10 and 20 refer to the actual percentage of distances
between adjacent electrodes which are either 10% or 20%
of the total front–back or right–left distance of the skull
[82]. As EEG is portable and allows capturing signal from
cerebral cortex with high temporal resolution, it is mainly
used in TV commercial engagement or success analysis. EEG signal of interest in Neuromarketing are mainly
event-related potential (ERP), and late positive potential
(LPP). ERP and LPP are used by Pozharliev et al. [20] to
measure the emotional value of luxury products. Çakar
et al. [34] used ERP to explore the experience of first-time
user of E-commerce product. Pilelienė and Grigaliūnaitė
[36]) used ERP along with eye tracking signal to measure
the impact of celebrity spokesman in TVC. Shen et al.

Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.

(2020) 7:10

[23] used ERP and LPP to explore the influence of rating
reviews on online products.
Research-grade EEG devices are vastly used in Neuromarketing. Emotiv Epoc and Emotive Epoc+ were found
as the mostly commonly used EEG devices in the review.
These devices were used in the studies of Yang et al. [45],
Chew et al. [17], Soria Morillo et al. [40], Yadava et al.
[18], Royo et al. [47], Jain et al. [63], and Singh et al. [56].
Emotive Epoc+ is a moveable, cost-effective EEG headset having 14 electrodes those cover the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes with channels AF3, F7,
F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, AF4. The
acquired brain signals from Emotiv Epoc+ are highly
dependable and have already been used in these scientific
researches. Another popular EEG device in Neuromarketing, NeuroSky Mindwave, has only one sensor placed
on the prefrontal cortex of the head or the forehead.
Unlike EEG devices with wet electrodes, Neurosky Mindwave employs a biosensor which does not require any
conductive medium to be applied on the test subject’s
scalp [40]. With the help of NeroSkyLab, the provided
scientific research tool, data viewing and analysis can be
conducted easily by non-engineer population. In 2015,
Soria Morillo et al. and Ogino and Mitsukura in 2018
conducted Neuromarketing experiment with NeuroSky
device and with the help of machine learning algorithm,
their choice prediction accuracy was over 70% [40, 68]. A
10-channel EEG device BrainAmp, from BrainProducts
GmBh was used in the Neuromarketing experiment conducted by Cherubino et al. [42]. Another device EEGO
Sports from ANT Neuro (32 channels) was used to analyze non-linear features of EEG signals by Oon et al. [55].
B-alert X10 headset from ABM consisting 9 electrode
channels is found in use by the experiment of Chew et al.
[17]. 8-channel E-Prime from Neuroscan is another EEG
device is used in the sales strategy experiment by Gong
et al. and Touchette et al. conducted their apparel liking
experiment with NeXus-10 biofeedback system. EEG
devices have different sampling rates starting from 128
to 512 Hz. This sampling rate determines the highest
frequency recordable by the EEG device. In general EEG
has a lower frequency spectrum, having Gamma band up
to 90 Hz. This gives researchers advantage to choose the
right EEG device from numerous manufacturers. Price
of EEG devices depends mainly on the number of electrode channels and performance. Cost of EEG device
starts from $99 and can go beyond $25,000, which gives
researchers buying flexibility.
Magnetoencephalography (MEG) uses magnetic
potentials to record brain activity at the scalp level, using
magnetic field sensitive detectors in the helmet placed
on the subject’s head. Magnetic field is not influenced
by the type of tissue (blood, brain matter, bones), unlike

Page 10 of 19

electrical field-based EEG, and can indicate the depth of
the location in the brain with high spatial and temporal
resolution [3]. Similar to MEG, transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) uses varying magnetic field [83] generated by electromagnetic induction using an iron core.
TMS can stimulate targeted part of the brain, which
enables it to conduct social or behavioral experiments.
TMS and MEG are also used frequently in Neuromarketing experiments. However, the selected databases for
this review did not contain any Neuromarketing research
articles using these technologies over the last 5 years.
The electromyography (EMG) measures electrical
activity produced by skeletal muscles when the muscles contracts and expands in order to move the body
[70]. Also EMG is generated from the autonomic nervous activity related to emotional or mental activity. In
Neuromarketing research, facial EMG is the best measure of the valence of the emotional reaction as it records
facial muscle movement from two different muscles, i.e.,
zygomaticus muscle and corrugator muscle. Zygomatic
muscle is found to react more while exposed to positive
stimuli [70].
Besides these brain signal recordings, eye tracking
is the most popular method for analyzing consumer
response. Eye tracking offers to measure visualization
time and gaze path across a screen in Neuromarketing experiments. Besides tracking eye movement, pupil
dilation measurement allows one to associate audience’s focus and arousal to the marketing stimuli. In the
reviewed literatures, Tobii Pro X2-30 system from Tobii
Technology was found as the most popular eye tracking device. In 2019, Etzold et al. used this eye tracking
device to explore attention research on online booking [48]. Tobii Pro can also cooperate with fMRI-based
Neuromarketing experiment (Venkatraman [38]). Other
than Tobii, Eye Tribe is found in use by Çakar et al. [34].
Ungureanu et al. used eye tracking to measure the attention level of consumers while displaying static advertisements of cars and clothing products [53]. Figure 1 depicts
the most popular methods of neural response recording
i.e. EEG, fMRI and eye tracking used in the Neuromarketing experiments.
Some of the Neuromarketing studies used heart rate, as
one of the metrics to measure arousal and focus of the
consumer while they encounter TV commercial stimuli.
Heart rate is the speed of the heartbeat and it is typically
measured by electrocardiogram (EKG). An EKG measures the electrical activity of the heart using external skin
electrodes. Heart rate is controlled by two antagonistic
nervous systems, i.e., the sympathetic nervous system
(SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS).
Automatic response to external stimuli is determined by
the sympathetic system of the body. Activation of this

appointment [48]

system increases heart rate, causing fight or flight mode,
which is an independent measure of arousal [38]. In contrast, the calm and relaxed state characterized by slower
heart rate is controlled by the parasympathetic system.
Slower heart rate in response to an advertisement implies
the increased focus on the ad, hence provides an independent measure of attention [38]. Another physiological parameter, skin conductance (SC), or galvanic skin
response (GSR), develops when the skin acts as an electrical conductor due to the increased activity of the sweat
glands from exposure to stimulus [38]. Skin conductance

amplitude and response latency provide direct measures
of arousal when watching TV commercials, unlike selfreported measures that are often based on later memory
recall. Although GSR cannot independently relate to
emotional valence, some of the Neuromarketing studies,
i.e., Cherubino et al. [42], Çakar et al. [34], Ungureanu
et al. [53], Magdin et al. [71], Goyal and Singh [54], and
Singh et al. [56] have used skin conductance along with
heart rate to measure the consumer attention and focus
on the TVC.

3.4 Brain signal processing in Neuromarketing

Since neural signals and images are highly vulnerable
to noise and artifacts, before performing any analysis
or interpretation it is imperative to preprocess the neural signals to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
Noises that commonly accompany the EEG signals
are cardiac signals (ECG), power line interference, eye
movement artifact (EOG) and muscle movement artifacts (EMG). Preprocessing in Neuromarketing consists
of filtering the signals to the frequency bands of interest, re-referencing the filtered signal to a common average, detecting and interpolating bad channels, noise
and artifact removal, and framing or segmentation for
further machine learning process.
EEG signals usually spread across its energy from
0.5 Hz to around 90 Hz. For classification purpose, it
is required to have energies only from the relevant frequency bands, hence EEG preprocessing commonly
uses band pass filtering techniques. Band pass filter
requires two cutoff frequencies, one upper and one
lower to pass the energy between them and blocks
energies from all other frequencies. Band pass filter
used in these Neuromarketing experiments are basically the digital version of the filter mostly applied by
MATLAB and EEGLAB (a toolbox designated for EEG
signal processing in MATLAB). Re-referencing to a
common average reference is also found common after
band pass filtering in the studies of Yang et al. [41], Fan
and Touyama [66] to reduce possible shifts from external artifacts. Power line interference is usually found
removed by using a notch filter at 60 Hz or 50 Hz.
The reviewed literatures had some common
approaches in noise removal techniques. Since the noise
accompanied with EEG signals are random in nature,
signal averaging is a common approach to reduce these
noises. Fan and Touyama [66] averaged the ERP signals
for noise removal. Chew et al. [17] used ABM software
development kit (SDK) in MATLAB to remove 5 types
of artifacts, namely EMG, eye blinking artifact, excursions, saturations and spike. Excursion, saturation and
spike artifacts in the EEG signals are replaced by zero values. Then they applied nearest neighbor interpolation to
replace those zero values. Another type of filter Savitzky–
Golay is found in use by Yadava et al. [18] for signal
smoothing. For noise and artifact removal, the ­4th-order
Butterworth filter was used in the studies of Ogino and
Mitsukura [68] and Oon et al. [55].
Independent component analysis (ICA) is an approach
to separate the statistical subcomponents of EEG signals. ICA is found as the most sought after technique
for removing artifacts and noise from EEG signals in
these articles. Studies of Cherubino et al. [42], Bhardwaj
et al. [53], Venkatraman et al. [38], Pozharliev et al. [20],

Page 12 of 19

Boksem and Smitds[57], Wriessnegger et al. [29], Fan and
Touyama [66], Pilelienė and Grigaliūnaitė [36] all used
independent component analysis mostly for eye blink
and eye movement artifact, and muscular movement
noise removal.
Neuromarketing with fMRI studies have a different
method for image preprocessing. Since the fMRI provides
a 3D image of the brain region with time information, it
is basically a 4D signal. A 4D dataset is motion corrected
for any head movement, slice time corrected, spatially
normalized and finally smoothed to recover a denoised
fMRI image. Wang et al. [30] used statistical parametric
mapping (SPM) software to preprocess their fMRI data.
Their raw fMRI signal was subjected to standard preprocessing involving correction for head motion, slice timing
correction, temporal and spatial denoising and normalization into standardized Montreal Neurological Institute
(MNI) space. The mean fMRI signal from each region of
interest was extracted from voxels in a sphere of 6-mm
radius centered at the activation point in the regional
activation map.
fMRI scan was also used by Hubert et al. [25] in their
experiment on hedonic vs. prudent shopper based on
consumer impulsiveness. Decision-making process with
cognitive deliberation and the consideration of longterm consequences are associated with processing in
brain areas such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
(vmPFC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC).
Hence, these vmPFC and dlPFC were the region of interests to capture the BOLD activation imaging [62]. Brain
activation through BOLD signals was used by Hsu and
Cheng [26] to investigate negative emotion after product harm crisis. fMRI region of interest in this study
included amygdala, left calcarine, striatum, ventral tegmental area (VTA) and right insula. The amygdala is
associated with memory and subjective evaluation, left
calcarine relates to human visual processing, the striatum
is associated with goal-oriented evaluation, and reward
evaluation, VTA relates to decision-making process and
motive functions, and the insula regions are involved in
consumer decision-making related to negative reinforcement. Acquiring activation within these regions affirms
the relation between stimuli and cognitive response.
Signal detection and segmentation is the process by
which the signal of interest is detected from the original signal and then separated for further procedures.
The energy of the signal may be used as a threshold
for detection of the signal. Often the Neuromarketing
experiments contain multiple types of stimuli shown
to the test subjects. In such cases segmentation separates the event-based time signals for further processing, example Bhardwaj et al. [58]. Segmentation
or framing the EEG signals to a shorter time window

Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.

(2020) 7:10

is mostly required to process the signal in time–frequency domain [58]. Cherubino et al. [42] segmented
their acquired and filtered EEG traces to extract the
cerebral activity during the exposure to the marketing stimuli. Oon et al. [55] used 1-s segmentation time
to extract non-linear detrended fluctuation analysis
features.
The goal of feature extraction is to find the set of
feature that minimizes intra-class variability and maximizes inter-class variability. So we need to extract useful information from the preprocessed signal, which
can be spatial, spectral or temporal [45]. As the EEG
signal is non-stationary, the feature extraction procedure is quite often complicated. Discrete wavelet
transformation (DWT) is a viable way to extract features from EEG signals.
Yadava et al. [18] performed DWT-based four-level
wavelet analysis to extract features from their EEG signals and decomposed the EEG signal into delta, theta,
alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands. Another
feature extraction approach, principal component
analysis (PCA) was used by Venkatraman et al. [38]
for extracting fMRI features in their Neuromarketing
experiment. In 2016, Fan and Touyama applied spatial
and temporal principal component analysis (STPCA)
for feature extraction from ERP P300 signal. Rakshit
and Lahiri [67] used a different approach to extract
features from EEG signals. They used Welch method
for one-sided power spectral density estimate and then
applied a 256-point DFT algorithm on hamming window of length 50 to extract features. Chew et al. [17]
adopted Hadjidimitriou and Hadjileontiadis methods
in feature extraction where the feature estimation is
based on the event-related synchronization and desynchronization theory.
Feature selection is also popularly known as dimensionality reduction or subset selection. This is a wellknown concept in machine learning which is about
selecting an optimal set of features that decreases
dimensionality, but has the most contribution to the
classification accuracy. In the past few years, feature
selection has caught the attention of most researchers because of the nature of high dimensionality of
bio-signals and the low number of sample data. Selection of the optimal feature subset is always relative to
an evaluation function. In most cases it is the evaluation function that measures the classification accuracy. Feature selection techniques can be divided into
three categories, namely: filter, wrapper and embedded approach. Wang et al. [30] used Recursive Cluster
Elimination (RCE) algorithm in spatiotemporal fMRI
feature selection. Soria Morillo et al. [40] used PCA for
feature reduction from their dataset. One-way analyses

Page 13 of 19

of variance (ANOVA) then cross-validation were also
found in use to identify the optimal feature set for cognitive or affective state classification by Yang et al. [41].
3.5 Machine learning application in Neuromarketing

Using advanced neural recording method and signal processing tools, one can analyze EEG signals and interpret
their correspondence with marketing stimuli. Frontal
alpha asymmetry theory helped the researcher classify
emotional approach/withdrawal response of the test subjects using sub-band power of left and right hemispheric
frontal electrode [21]. However, classifying approach/
withdrawal or like/dislike without the FAA is possible,
even possible from single electrode EEG signals. This
requires advanced Machine Learning algorithm application in Neuromarketing. Both supervised and unsupervised learning methods were used in the following
Neuromarketing experiments. Supervised learning in
Neuromarketing uses a priori ground truth, usually the
interviewed response (like/dislike) from the test subjects
as the labels. The labels help the classifier know the signal pattern of like and dislike EEGs in the training datasets. During the testing phase, like/dislike is predicted
from a dataset without the labels. Researcher can hide
the training dataset labels from the classifier, and later
use it for accuracy calculation. On the other hand, unsupervised learning approach used in Neuromarketing does
not require prior knowledge of the like/dislike labels.
It analyzes the signals with an aim to infer the existing
structures for different classes. Supervised learning usually solves either classification problem or a regression
problem. Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes,
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forests
(RF) are the most common supervised learning classifiers in Neuromarketing. In parallel, unsupervised learning
in Neuromarketing has prominently the clustering type
classifiers, such as K-NN (k-nearest neighbors), principal
component analysis, singular value decomposition, and
independent component analysis (ICA).
Neuromarketing researches over the last 5 years mainly
dealt with like/dislike classification problem and predicting consumer choice problem. Besides the learning
method, both linear and non-linear classifiers have been
used in these Neuromarketing experiments. The most
used classification algorithms used in Neuromarketing
over the last 5 years are Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Naïve Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor
(KNN) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM).
SVM is a supervised learning method, which requires
training data for inferring a relation and recognizing patterns. SVM works as a discriminative classifier while a
hyperplane separates the different classes. Based on the

Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.

(2020) 7:10

training data SVM creates a hyperplane which further
classifies the new data. The advantage of using SVM in
Neuromarketing is its computational simplicity and
accuracy level. LDA classifiers are used in several literatures in comparison with SVM classifiers. LDA gathers
data points with similar frequencies as distinct groups
and 1D Eigen transformation creates the separate classes.
Bhardwaj et al. [53] extracted energy and power spectral
density as the feature from the acquired EEG signal and
applied SVM and LDA classifiers to classify human emotions from EEG signals. Their model achieved 74.13%
average accuracy for SVM-based emotion (happy, sad,
anger, disgust, neutral, fear and surprised) classification.
In contrast, the model achieved 66.50% average accuracy for LDA-based emotion classification. In the P300
signal-based experiment of Fan and Toyuyama, they used
LD classifier to retrieve emotional faces from different
subjects.
In 2016, Ogino and Mitsukura experimented on a
single-channel EEG device for emotion estimation for
mobile application. Their study used SVM, LR, KNN and
SVR together to create a model of valence estimation
from EEG signals. They used two regression methods linear regression (LR) and support vector regression (SVR)
to define valence as sequential value from 1 to 9. SVM
and KNN classified nine emotional classes, and SVR minimized the number of sample errors. Rakshit and Lahiri
used SVM and interval-type 2 fuzzy classifiers to classify
red blue and green colors from EEG signals. Their model
achieved the classification with 78.81% average accuracy
for SVM-based color classification [67]. However, IT2FS
achieved the highest 80.04% mean accuracy compared to
other classifiers in the experiment.
The hidden Markov model (HMM) is non-linear classifier under another supervised learning method. It is
derived from statistical modeling and is widely used
in temporal and biomedical signals. In Neuromarketing experiments, HMM is used to classify multiclass
sequential data where transition from one mental state to
another mental state can occur. Researchers can find possible observation of the states using the state transition
probabilities. Yadava et al. proposed an HMM-based consumer choice prediction (like/dislike) model using EEG
signals from frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobe.
They compared their classification model with standard
classifiers such as SVM, RF and ANN. Their HMM-based
model achieved classification accuracy of 70.33% for male
test subjects and 63.56% for female test subjects [18]. In
comparison, accuracy of 62.85% was achieved with SVM
classifier with C = 6, whereas ANN with two hidden layers achieved 60% average accuracy.
K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm serves both as a classification and regression algorithm. KNN algorithm predicts

the test sample’s category based on to the K training samples which are the nearest neighbors to the test sample.
In contrast to the hyperplane of SVM, KNN creates a
decision boundary among different distinct classes. In
the experiment of Chew et al. [17], SVM and KNN are
used to explore the esthetic preference for 3D shapes.
The mean accuracy for SVM classifier obtained was 68%,
whereas the mean accuracy for KNN classifier was 64%.
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a form of neural
network classifiers. ANN is a collection of artificial neurons which produces non-linear decision boundaries
among large number of classes. ANN and its different
subtypes are now becoming more common for the Neuromarketing data interpretation. However, ANN requires
large number of sample data and large number of features. Soria Morillo et al. used ANN algorithm in 2015
and 2016 in comparison with Random Forest algorithm
C4.5 and Ameva, respectively. In 2015, their advertisement liking recognition model achieved 80% average
accuracy with ANN and 69.4% for C4.5 classifier [43]. In
2016, ANN, C4.5 and Ameva achieved average accuracy
of 80%, 69%, and 75%, respectively.
Oon et al. focused on recognizing preference among
different categories of products (food, automobile, etc.)
using KNN and ANN to analyze non-linear features of
the EEG signals [55]. ANN and KNN inputs were used
as the features for Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)
which achieved the highest classification accuracy 80%
for alpha waves, and 76.18% for beta waves. Doborjeh
et al. [64] used another type of Neural Network, Spiking
Neural Network (SNN) to recognize attention bias pattern from spatio-temporal EEG signal. In their study, a
brain-like SNN methodology (NeuCube) was used to create models from EEG signals to evaluate how attention
bias can affect the consumer preferences. Their SNNbased classification model achieved 89.95% average accuracy, while traditional machine learning SVM classifier
achieved 48.5% accuracy.

4 Result synthesis
This section synthesizes the results from already discussed research articles and book chapters with empirical findings on Neuromarketing, published from 2015 to
2019. To ensure the reliability of the experimental findings, the reviewed literatures had largely set their statistical significance at p < 0.05 [20, 38, 42, 43, 46, 59, 60, 70].
With the advancements in technologies, marketing
stimuli have become more TV commercial or image
of the product oriented rather than the original product [18–26, 34–43]. 3D image of the products have also
added to these virtual product purchase decision-making
[17]. E-commerce products have gained interest among
the Neuromarketing researchers, since these products

Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.

(2020) 7:10

are now more available to the consumers through online
shopping [34]. First-time user experience in online shopping and user experience in online appointment have
also diversified the stimuli group of Neuromarketing
research. Other than these marketing focused stimuli,
some of the Neuromarketing studies focused on social
advertisements, particularly the campaign against smoking and alcohol consumption among young adults. These
social advertisements used neuroimaging and neural signal decoding techniques to assess and predict the success
of their message reaching the targeted social groups.
Analyzing consumer’s emotional response is found
as a focus of current Neuromarketing research articles.
These experiments widely used Frontal Alpha Asymmetry theory for left and right frontal channel. Besides the
alpha band, beta and theta bands are also found in use
in these literatures to recognize cognitive and emotional
response of the consumers. Table 3 summarizes the findings related to brainwaves and their functionalities in the
reviewed Neuromarketing literatures.
Over the last 5 years in consumer neuroscience
research, the use of research-grade commercially available EEG devices has become more popular than fMRI
scanners. EEG has been particularly used in TV advertisement evaluation, where a high temporal resolution is
required to explore the dynamic effects of TV commercials. Even though fMRI has been used less in the Neuromarketing experiments, the use of fMRI is particularly
found when a consumer is displayed product images and
asked to make purchase decision [30]. The reason behind
using product images as marketing stimuli in fMRI-based
Neuromarketing research is that, fMRI can point out the
activated brain region when a subject encounters a marketing stimuli. The activated brain region can estimate
the positive or negative experience of the consumer in
their brain. However, TVC changes stimuli in millisecond
time frame, response of which cannot be obtained by an
fMRI scanner with 2–5 s image refresh rate. Other than
EEG and fMRI, fNIRS has started to enter the Neuromarketing research field. Having the advantage of mobility,
fNIRS has been used in purchase behavior correlation
and consumer reaction examination by Çakir et al. and
Krampe et al. In these cases, fNIRS has shown accuracy over 70% and scored in reliability scale 0.7 out of 1,

Page 15 of 19

respectively [24, 60]. This shows fNIRS can be a promising mean of neural recording for future Neuromarketing
experiments.
While comparing the EEG devices, Emotiv Epoc
and Emotive Epoc+ had the largest number of academic research conducted through them. Other than
the 14-channel device, BrainAmp is a 10-channel EEG
device and eego Sports is a 32-channel device used by
Neuromarketing researchers. NeuroSky MindWave
despite having only one sensor, provided denoised EEG
data and performed well with accuracy over 70%.
All of the fMRI-based Neuromarketing studies over
the last 5 years have used 3-Tesla fMRI scanner Magnetom Trio, SIEMENS, and Siemens Verio scanner for
their experiments [25, 30, 62]. The advantage of 3.0-T
functional MRI is the high spatial resolution. However,
BOLD signal-based fMRI has the possible confusion
with blood flow due to head or muscle movement.
Signal preprocessing in the selected articles was
mainly performed by using MATLAB and EEGLAB.
Besides band pass filtering, increased used of independent component analysis (ICA) in spatiotemporal
domain is also observed over the course of last 5 years
[20, 36, 38, 42, 53]. Other than noise and artifact
removal, preprocessing dealt with framing or segmentation of the temporal EEG signal. The fMRI data were
preprocessed using the statistical parametric mapping
(SPM) software.
In this systematic review, a number of Neuromarketing research experiments used artificial intelligent
algorithms for prediction and classification purposes.
Table 4 compares the average classification accuracy
achieved by these algorithms in the selected Neuromarketing studies.
While comparing the classification performance
of machine learning algorithms in Neuromarketing
research, we found the Artificial Neural Network had
the highest classification accuracy around 80% among
all other algorithms [40, 43]. However, ANN requires
more training data than other classifiers such as 70%
data in training and 30% in testing, which calls into
question its viability in Neuromarketing. After ANN,
SVM was the algorithm most widely used in Neuromarketing with the second highest classification accuracy

5 Recommendation
From this systematic review, authors would like to suggest future Neuromarketing researchers to first define
the scope of their inquisition, which defines the rest
of the process. Neuromarketing on product purchase
assessment and purchase decision-making have been
using functional MRI to locate the activated region in
consumer brain to predict the success or failure of the
product. However, to recognize consumer engagement
with product commercial, it is worthwhile to use EEG
devices with high temporal resolution. Neuromarketing experiments with EEG devices of 14 channels and 32
channels have established their research-grade performance. However, the raw data availability should be kept
in mind by the researchers while selecting an EEG device.
Also, researcher should consider availability of bilateral
EEG electrodes if they would like to utilize frontal alpha
asymmetry theory. Accompanying EEG, eye tracking has
also shown high performance in attention and arousal
locating. Eye tracker, heart rate monitor, galvanic skin
response device can be used alongside brain signal to

cross-validate the experimental findings. While choosing
among classifiers, although ANN has shown better performance consistently. However, authors would recommend preferring linear classifier over neural networks, as
most of the Neuromarketing sampling EEG dataset does
not contain plethora of samples to train a complex classifier as ANN.

6 Conclusion
Neuromarketing is an emerging field with opportunities in commercial, social and political advertisement
domain. The advancements of this field hence requires
proper documentation to capture its state-of-art. This
study was conducted with a focus to shed light on the
technological scope and possible opportunities in this
field. Authors found over the course of last 5 years, Neuromarketing experiments have been conducted mainly
with the stimuli of consumer goods, in both product
and promotion forms. However, Neuromarketing is
showing its possibilities in the domain of social advertisement. Neuromarketing researchers tend to focus on
the frontal and prefrontal cortex of consumer brain for
cognitive and emotional inquiries. Among all brain signal recording devices, we found EEG is becoming more
popular in Neuromarketing experiments, especially with

Rawnaque et al. Brain Inf.

(2020) 7:10

TVC analysis due to its high temporal resolution and
cost effectiveness. However, EEG devices have different
sampling rates causing a limitation for highest analyzable frequency, which should be under the scrutiny of
the researchers. Signal processing in these studies largely
adopted ICA for noise and artifact removal. Finally, the
highest number of studies have used SVM for classification purpose among all other algorithms, perhaps due
to its simplicity. We hope, our findings will guide future
researchers to explore the opportunities in this field in a
more efficient manner.
