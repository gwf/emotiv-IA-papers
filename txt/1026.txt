Abstract: During a non-invasive procedure, participants both helped and helped by a confederate
with features that create social distance (membership in an ethnic outgroup or another social group).
For this purpose, we created a set of virtual scenarios in which the confederate’s ethnicity (white
vs. black) and appearance (business man vs. beggar, with casual dress as a control condition)
were crossed. The study aimed to explore how the emotional reactions of participants changed
according to the confederate’s status signals as well as signals that they belong to the same or a
different ethnic group. Participants’ alertness, calmness, and engagement were monitored using
electroencephalogram (EEG) during the original virtual reality (VR) video sessions. Participants’
distress and empathy when exposed to helping interactions were self-assessed after the VR video
sessions. The results pointed out that, irrespective of whether they helped the confederate or were
helped by him/her, white participants showed higher levels of alertness when exposed to helping
interactions involving a white beggar or a black businessman, and their emotional calmness and
engagement were higher when interacting with a black beggar or a white businessman. The results
for self-assessed distress and empathy followed the same tendency, indicating how physiological
and self-assessed measures can both contribute to a better understanding of the emotional processes
in virtual intergroup helping situations. Based on the presented results, the methodological and
practical implications of VR in terms of enhancing self-reflective capacities in intergroup helping
processes are discussed.

1. Introduction
The present work aims to test the emotional dimensions of intergroup helping interactions using
a virtual environment. According to classical socio-psychological literature, both the decisions to give
and seek help are associated with emotional arousal. Giving help may be associated with a personal
evaluation (“Am I capable of helping?” “Can my help be effective?”), eventually leading to a final
decision regarding whether to help [1]. When seeking help, emotions are aroused by the admission of
incapability and implication of dependence on the donor in any explicit request [2]. Moreover, since
helping interactions decrease social distance when the helper and helpee are perceived as dissimilar
from one another, as in cases in which one belongs to an outgroup, emotional arousal is theoretically
expected to increase [3] and the decision to help or request help is expected to become lower. However,
empirical pieces of evidence collected according to this theoretical framework while directly observing

help-seeking and help-giving behaviors, hypothesized how emotions and self-assessed emotional
arousal could be associated with social desirability of respondents. We, therefore, planned to run a pilot
experimental study within a virtual reality (VR) environment in which participants’ emotional reactions
could be both directly monitored and self-assessed. Social distance during helping interactions was
manipulated by exposing participants to virtual scenarios in which they were faced with both seeking
and giving help to a confederate helper/helpee with three different types of dress (business man vs.
beggar, with casual dress as a control condition) and different ethnicities (white vs. black), which
were either the same or different from the ethnicity of the participants (all of whom were white Italian
university students). Aside from the control scenario, when crossed, these two variables led to four
different conditions. Two conditions involved maximum similarity between the participants and
confederate (played by a white actor), and either high status (the actor was dressed as a businessman)
or low status (the actor was dressed as a beggar) was signalled. The other two conditions involved
maximum dissimilarity between the participants and confederate (played by a black actor), and either
high status (the actor was dressed as a businessman) or low status (the actor was dressed as a beggar)
was signalled.
Within this research, the role played by empathy was taken into account using traditional
self-assessed measures. According to the consolidated scientific definition [4], empathy is a complex
emotional state composed of a positive empathic experience of being focused on the other (which
causes one to feel soft-hearted, compassionate, and moved), as well as a negative experience of personal
distress due to others’ suffering (which causes one to feel upset and distressed).
The results revealed that the two self-assessed sides of empathy (personal distress and empathic
interest) loosely mirrored the EEG measures of alertness, calmness, and engagement. Thus, these
were directly monitored during participants’ exposure to helping interactions with confederates.
Participants showed higher alertness according to the EEG measure and self-reported more personal
distress while exposed to a helping interaction in which the person in need was either a high-status
member of another ethnic group or a low-status member of the same ethnic group. On the contrary,
participants showed higher levels of calmness and engagement when interacting with a person in need
who was either a low-status member of another ethnic group or a high-status member of the same
ethnic group. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sections 2 and 3 present classical works
on helping, empathy, and intergroup relations and look at studies that use VR; Section 4 illustrates
the performed experiment and discusses the results, and the last section discusses conclusions and
future work.
2. Intergroup Helping and Empathy
According to psychological studies, cognitive processes based on prosocial decisions are strictly
associated with emotional processes [5]. Classical studies on prosocial behavior have tested how positive
emotions like empathy [4,6] can promote prosocial behaviors. In addition, they have tested more
generally how low-arousal emotions, like sadness, can drive other-oriented cost–benefit processing
rather than automatic and more intuitive processing, which is used when emotions are stronger and
more difficult to regulate [7]. The decision to help or not has been largely studied with the theoretical
model of intergroup helping relations as status relations [8], which stresses that giving help can
perpetuate the social dependency of people in need. Within this framework, outgroup people in
need are perceived by “powerful” helpers as people with low competence and opportunities, and the
powerful helpers tend to help the people in need since they can elicit emotions of sadness or pity [8,9].
From this perspective, the helping process should depend on helpers’ expectations. On the other
hand, refugees and immigrants are generally described [10] as criminals (“crimmigration”) [11] and
associated with the stigma of dependence [12,13]. They are perceived as dependent people (e.g., as
“parasites”) in need of humanitarian protection. Thus, immigrants can be perceived as “dangerous” or
“helpless” [11] and therefore, can be associated with negative emotions, such as anger [12], pity, sadness
and bitterness [14]. Based on prior studies, intergroup helping interactions are mediated by the helpers’

Appl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1196

3 of 12

expectations and perceptions of dissimilarity, which can be associated with motivation to defend the
ingroup image [3,15]. When dissimilarity is high, the helper can perceive more psychological costs and
then can avoid making the decision to help. The aim of this preliminary study is to observe potential
differences in calmness, engagement, and alertness in relation to the helpee’s ethnicity (black or white)
and relative autonomy or dependence.
In addition to these theoretical considerations, we also want to observe the role played by empathy,
which can promote helping behaviors [16,17] since it is based on perspective-taking of the other.
Empathy can be considered a complex emotional state composed of a cognitive side, which involves
perspective-taking and a positive approach toward the other, and an affective side, which involves the
emotions related to the act of taking the other’s perspective. In this context, Stephan and Finlay [18]
differentiated between parallel empathy, which involves trying emotions similar to those of the target,
and reactive empathy, which involves feeling emotions in response to the emotions of the target [19].
Also, Batson [4] acknowledged the complex nature of empathy, which is composed of the empathic
experience of being focused on the other (in which one is softhearted, compassionate, and moved)
and personal distress for others’ suffering (in which one is upset and distressed). From psychological
studies on empathy, we know that it is important to differentiate between the two sides of empathy:
spontaneous empathic interest in the other, which is close to an altruistic orientation, and the negative
side, defined in the literature as personal distress in reaction to another person’s need or suffering. This
double nature of empathy has been also explored in psychophysiological studies, in which scholars
pointed out that empathy can be associated with both left and right EEG asymmetry as it is an emotional
response to the other’s need (left frontal asymmetry) and, at the same time, involves emotional sharing
of the other’s pain (right frontal asymmetry) [20].
3. Prosocial Virtual Reality
Schutte and Stilinović [21] have shown that prosocial behavior is closely related to the degree of
involvement in VR, which can, in turn, increase user empathy. The experiment conducted by Groom
and colleagues [22] was significant, as it showed that experience in VR (a job interview) with an avatar
of different skin colour might be affected by prejudice; the interaction with a black avatar generated
negative evaluation and a higher level of implicit bias. A more recent study by Peck et al. [23] obtained
results in the opposite direction. Using sophisticated technology involving body transfer into avatars,
Peck and colleagues found that when participants embodied an avatar with black skin, they tended to
present fewer racial implicit biases than those who embodied an avatar with white skin. Similarly,
in a study by Gillath et al. [24], participants seated at a bus stop witnessed an accident involving a
blind man’s dog. The verbal reactions to the man’s request for help showed that VR scenarios can
arouse positive behavioral emotions and tendencies towards virtual people in need, similar to scenarios
involving needy people in the real world. However, a study done by Eastwick and Gardner [25]
showed that the helping relationship in VR follows a certain logic: people tend to help similar helpees.
In their experiments, white helpers tended to give less help to black-colored avatars than white ones.
More recently, Gamberini et al. [26] analyzed helping behavior in a VR emergency, which generally
increased participants’ level of anxiety, and showed that time pressure worsens the effect of ingroup
favoritism and results in less help given to black victims.
4. The Pilot Study
The majority of the cited studies that involved VR contexts focus on the elicitation of negative
emotions of anxiety or concern and pay less attention to helping behaviors within familiar contexts, in
which an outgroup member may be in a temporary state of need or may provide help. The research
goal of this pilot study is to explore potential differences in calmness, engagement, and alertness in
simulated helping situations (both seeking and giving help) in relation to the ethnicity (black of white)
of passersby and in relation to the relative autonomy or dependence of the passersby, manipulated by
their external social appearance (dressed like a businessman, casually, or like a beggar). By crossing

Appl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1196

these two variables, we created a stereotypical condition, called the socially expected situation, and a
counter-stereotypical one called the socially unexpected condition. Since we referred to the classical
theorization of stereotypes, in the interpersonal judgements, we used simplified schema that generally
associates Africans or black people with low status and white people with high status [27]. In our
case, the stereotypical conditions include a black passerby dressed like a beggar and a white passerby
dressed like a businessman. The opposites are regarded as counter-stereotypical conditions. Another
goal was to test empathic responses, considering both personal distress and empathic interest, during
the VR intergroup helping session.
4.1. Method
4.1.1. Participant and experimental design
The total number of participants was 40 (19 women and 21 men, mean age 23.76). All were white
Italian university students in human sciences programs, mainly from Rome, and they were randomly
and equally distributed across the experimental conditions. We initially included participants from
other countries and ethnicities, but we deleted them from the present sample. The study consists of
a 3 × 2 between-subjects experimental design, in which we manipulated the following independent
variables: the social appearance of the confederate (businessman vs. casual vs. beggar) and the
ethnicity of the passerby (white vs. black), which determined their membership in the ingroup or
outgroup, respectively. We assumed an effect on the dependent variables—calmness, engagement,
and alertness (EEG measures)—during the helping VR session and self-assessed empathy, personal
distress, and empathic interest at the end of the VR session.
4.1.2. Procedure and tools
The experimental procedure involved three phases. In the first phase, the participants were
subjected to a pre-test in order to explore their previous experiences with VR. In the second phase of
the experiments, participants were involved in a VR video session with a total length of seven minutes.
The VR experience had a medium level of immersion since participants could, from their point of view,
be partially physically present in the context (which was familiar), and they could decide and respond
to the actors, but they could not influence the virtual scene (i.e., the user had a low level of agency). For
recording, we used a 4K Ricoh Theta V monoscopic camera to obtain 360◦ video and audio. The 360◦
videos were watched by wearing a headset (HTC Vive) that could track users’ position in space by
increasing the level of immersion. After instructions on using the display were provided and the EEG
sensors for calmness, engagement, and alertness were positioned, the participants began to see a video
that corresponded to one of the six experimental conditions. The video introduced the participant to
the virtual environment through a training session, which was appropriately designed to familiarize
them with the device and provide him/her with the instructions necessary to interact with actors in
the scenes and with the pop-up system used in the scenario. During the training, the participant was
shown his “travel” kit, which consisted of a metro pass, two metro tickets and four 50-cent coins, which
he could have used during his experience. The participants did not have anything else with them.
The training scene was followed by an environmental scene that served as the real experimental
session, with a duration of about five minutes. In this session, a guiding voice accompanied the
participant throughout the route. The participant then entered the heart of the experience and was
projected at the entrance of a metro station, where he/she met a hurried friend who informed him/her
of a party and invited him/her to come, giving him/her the name of the street. In the following scene,
called “Google Maps,” the participant met a passerby—a potential helper (ingroup vs. outgroup
x businessman/casual/beggar; Figure 1a–c)—who, if asked, could help the participant find his way.
Through the pop-up system, participants made a choice to either ask or not ask for help, provided
reasons for their choice, and moved on to the next scene. This scene, called “Ticket Office,” presented the
opposite situation, which was focused mainly on help-giving interactions, and participant encountered

Appl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1196

a helpee with the same features, for social appearance and type of group, of the first session. Thus, the
two confederates, both male, encountered during the virtual experience, had the same features of the
assigned experimental condition, even if two different actors interpret them.
In the second session, the participant became a potential helper for a confederate passerby (ingroup

and θ (4–8 Hz). The values of the indicators described below were then calculated as averages for the
selected channels.
1. Calmness Index (TBR)
The calmness index (theta-beta ratio, or TBR) was calculated based on the ratio between the beta
band and theta band (see Equation (1)) [31]. A decrease in beta band power (which leads to higher
TBR) is associated with a decrease in information processing, which leads to a more relaxed condition.
TBR has been shown to be negatively correlated to attention and anxiety [31]. Conversely, it increases
when the level of attention decreases, and thus it is defined an objective marker of executive cognitive
control [32].
θ
TBR =

β
2. Engagement Index (EI)
The engagement index (EI) was obtained by considering alpha, beta, and theta activities (see
Equation (2)). An increase in beta activity is directly related to task engagement, while an increase in
alpha and theta activities reflects relaxation, a low level of alertness, and a decrease in information
processing [33,34]. An increase in the EI index reflects an increase in the level of engagement [35].
EI = β/(α + θ)

(2)

3. Alertness Index (BBR)
The alertness index (beta-beta ratio, or BBR) was calculated based on the ratio between the upper
beta band and the lower beta band (see Equation (3)) [36]. It has been shown that an increase in βhigh
is linked to an increase in alertness and strain [37], while an increase in βlow can be linked to an
increase in inattention [36,37]. Therefore, an increase in BBR may indicate an increase in alertness and
attention levels.
BBR = βhigh /βlow
(3)
4.2.2. Self-Reported Measures: Empathy
The level of empathy felt towards the confederate in a state of need was measured using the
Batson scale [4], which is composed of fourteen adjectives that describe emotional states of personal
distress (alarmed, embittered, annoyed, uncomfortable, baffled, embarrassed, worried, and upset) and
empathic interest (empathetic, sensitive, affable, compassionate, affectionate, and moved). Participants
indicated on a seven-point scale (1 = not at all, 7 = very much) the intensity of each emotion.
The data obtained from the Batson empathy scale [4] were subjected to a preliminary analysis
to measure their reliability using the Cronbach’s alpha index. Factorial analysis confirmed the
two-dimensional structure of the scale (the saturation for each item was higher than 0.30). In order
to obtain a single general index of empathy, we followed validated methodological suggestions [4],
initially calculating the sum of the scores of the personal distress and empathic interest indexes.
Subsequently, personal distress scores were subtracted from the empathic interest scores. This score
theoretically represents the classical significant measure of empathic response [4].
4.3. Results
The following results are related to combined indexes for the two sessions (Google Maps and
Ticket Office), both when participants receive both when they give help to the virtual confederate; only
in one case we reported a measure referred in particular to the second session (Ticket office), and it has
been reported in the Table 1.

during a helping interaction. In order to test the theoretical assumption that was previously discussed

In order to test the theoretical assumption that was previously discussed in this paper, participants
were asked to interact with two confederates, one in the first scenario who provided help and another
one who asked for help. The social distance of the confederate was manipulated by crossing two

Appl. Sci. 2020, 10, 1196

independent variables: the confederate’s ethnicity and social status. During both the help-giving
and help-seeking interactions, participants were confronted by a person of the same or different
ethnic group (i.e., white or black), who showed signals of either high status (i.e., was dressed like a
businessman) or low status (i.e., was dressed like a beggar), depending on the condition. Interestingly,
the physiological monitoring of emotional arousal during actual helping interactions, extracted by an
EEG tool, and self-assessment of empathic involvement in personal distress, measured after the end of
the VR experience, seemed to converge. Regarding alertness, both the information extracted from EEG
data and the responses to the empathy scales suggested that participants reacted with alarm and were
evaluated as more personally distressed when intergroup helping interactions—both help-seeking and
help-giving—involved either a low-status member of the ingroup (i.e., a white beggar) or a high-status
member of the outgroup (i.e., a black businessman). In contrast, socially expected conditions elicited a
state of calmness or engagement [38] or, in terms of self-assessed measures, empathic interest.
Two theoretical frameworks can be used to deepen our discussion of these data. On the one
hand, several scholars proposed that intergroup contact situations [39] can increase what they called
“intergroup anxiety [40],” which makes the social distance between people belonging to different
groups more salient. On the other hand, it has been proposed that socially-expected situations produce
a higher sense of control, while situations with events that do not follow stereotypical assumptions elicit
a state of alarm since people have less possibilities to foresee and manage these surprising occurrences.
Based on this, it could be argued that irrespective of their role as the helper or helpee, participants felt
alarmed in helping interactions with a low-status ingroup member or a high-status outgroup member,
as things occurred in an unexpected and troubling way.
Another reason these data are of interest is the fact that the results for self-assessed distress and
empathy followed the same tendency as directly measured physiological reactions. This suggests
that using both EEG monitoring and self-assessed measures can significantly contribute to deepening
the understanding of emotional processes involved in intergroup helping processes. Moreover,
allowing participants to discuss virtual intergroup settings can be a powerful tool for enhancing
their self-reflective capacities. This proposed application is strongly supported by the fact that, at
the end of their VR experience, all participants positively evaluated the setting as immersive and
familiar, which allowed them to behave naturally. These appreciative comments suggest that such
a methodology could be used for not only collecting empirical data but also offering participants a
precious opportunity to reflect on their daily reactions to intergroup helping dynamics [13,41–43].
It must be stressed that this pilot study was limited. Specifically, the relative paucity of the sample
did not allow for generalization of the results. Further research must be performed using the same
procedure, but recruiting a larger number of participants and extending the variables to include other
familiar [44] and cultural backgrounds. Despite these limitations, however, the results encourage us,
and we propose that VR experiences could be a useful methodology for integrating into future studies
and may be applied to efforts to deepen the real time emotional processes [45] and to overcome the
social exclusion of discrimination.
