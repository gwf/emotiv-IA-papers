Abstract—Anxiety affects human capabilities and behavior
as much as it affects productivity and quality of life. It can
be considered as the main cause of depression and suicide.
Anxious states are detectable by specialists due to their acquired
cognition and skills, humans interpret the interlocutor’s tone of
speech, gesture, facial expressions and recognize their mental
state. There is a need for non-invasive reliable techniques that
performs the complex task of anxiety detection. In this paper, we
present DASPS database containing recorded Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of 23 participants during anxiety elicitation
by means of face-to-face psychological stimuli. EEG signals were
captured with Emotiv Epoc headset as it’s a wireless wearable
low-cost equipment. In our study, we investigate the impact of
different parameters, notably: trial duration, feature type, feature
combination and anxiety levels number. Our findings showed that
anxiety is well elicited in 1 second. For instance, stacked sparse
autoencoder with different type of features achieves 83.50% and
74.60% for 2 and 4 anxiety levels detection, respectively. The
presented results prove the benefits of the use of a low-cost
EEG headset instead of medical non-wireless devices and create a
starting point for new researches in the field of anxiety detection.
Index Terms—Electroencephalogram, stress and anxiety detection, psychological stimulation, feature extraction, feature
selection.

I. I NTRODUCTION
NXIETY is a mental health issue that has physical
consequences on our bodies. However, it can affect the
immune system, and unfortunately, there is evidence that
too much anxiety can actually weaken the immune system
dramatically [1]. Anxiety is essentially a long term stress, in
such a way the stress hormone is liberated by our bodies in
huge quantities which correlates with body performance degradation. This invisible disability can greatly affect academic
performance as well. Anxiety impacts memory capacities,
leading to difficulties in learning and retraining information.
An anxious individual performs less efficiently, which significantly affects his capabilities. One in eight children suffers
from anxiety disorders according to the Anxiety Disorders
Association of America reports [2]. Nevertheless, it presents
a risk for poor performance, diminished learning and social/behavioral problems in school. Since anxiety disorders

in children are difficult to identify, it is an imperative task
to learn how to detect them in early stages in order to help
them. It may manifest by signs such as increased inflexibility,
overreactivity and emotional intensity.
Besides, effective anxiety and stress management can help
balance stress in your life, while keeping high productivity
and enjoying life. The intention is to find harmony between
work, relationships and self-awareness, and to learn how to
deal with anxiety states to confront challenges. But anxiety
management is not one-size-fits-all, so we need to detect when
anxiety is present, how it manifests in our bodies and how our
neurological system reacts to such situations.
Recently, Dr. Shanker introduced the Self-Reg Framework
which helps individuals understand and interact with others
by considering self-regulation from the biological, emotional,
cognitive, social, and pro-social domains using The Shanker
Method: Reevaluate the behavior.Identify the stressors, Minimize the stress, Enhance stress awareness and Develop personalized strategies to promote resilience and restoration. Hence,
anxiety and stress management is one of numerous fields that
requires the need for automated anxiety detection.
Anxiety detection is an underlying part of affect recognition.
Another area that could significantly benefit from progress
in affect recognition is the video game industry. New trends
of therapeutic environments for rehabilitation of patients with
serious mental disorders, implement an affect detection algorithms. Biofeedback systems can help children, adolescent and
adults control and manage their levels of anxiety, and facilitate
real life challenges.
For our research we treated anxiety as a temporary state as
such, we selected healthy patients and we used the recitation
of real life situations to stimulate anxiety within them.
Anxiety mainly arises due to three factors, namely external,
internal and interpersonal. Table I shows anxiety categories
and their stimuli from real life situations. To select the
situations with the highest anxiety levels, a survey was carried
out and diffused for all volunteers who wanted to participate
in our experiment. Based on the conducted survey, we selected
6 situations where participants experienced the highest anxiety
levels as portrayed hereinafter: Loss (68%), Family issues
(64%), financial issues (54%), Deadline (46%), Witnessing
deadly accident (45%) and Mistreating (40%).
This paper is organized into 8 sections. In section 2, we
present an overview of the realized works for anxiety detection
from EEG signals. In section 3, we detail the implemented
experimental protocol and the analysis of the collected data in
terms of variability and coherence. The followed steps for data

II. L ITERATURE OVERVIEW
Based on biometrics, many researches were conducted for
the recognition of persons’ identity, mental and physical health
[11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16].
Researches conducted for anxiety/stress detection based on
EEG signals analysis are few compared to those done for emotion recognition surveyed in [17] [18]. Most of the proposed
works for EEG-based emotion recognition as in [19] [3] were
validated using DEAP datatset [20]. It was recorded using
Biosemi Active 2 headset with 32 channels. 32 particpants
were watching 40 videos of one-minute duration. In their
work, Giorgos et al. [6] extracted two subdatasets of trials
from DEAP dataset [20] according to predefined conditions
for two emotional states: stress and calm. The idea is to
define thresholds for valence and arousal and extract only
trials which respect this condition. Consequently, the previous
step leads to a subset of 18 subjects conform to the adequate
norm. The authors extracted spectral, temporal and non linear
EEG features to represent the investigated states. Otherwise,
some researchers opt to conduct a suitable experimentation to
collect their own EEG signals. In the work of Vanita et al.
[7], the authors looked at students’ stress levels and defined
their own experimental protocol to record EEG signals during
stress elicitation session. Thenceforth, data was preprocessed
for noise and ocular artifact removal. Features were extracted
by the mean of a time-frequency analysis and classification
was performed by an hierarchical Support Vector Machines
that gave an accuracy of 89.07%. To investigate the realtime
issue, Lahane et al. [21] proposed an EEG-based stress detection system. They employed an android application to gather
EEG data. As feature, the Relative Energy Ratio (RER) was
calculated for each frequency band.
Single channel EEG signal was recorded from 25 students
from the Sunway University for a Stress Detection System

proposed by [9]. Using the NeuroSky Mindwave headset, the
data was collected and stored for further analysis. Students’
stress was elicited for 60 seconds by Stroop color word test
preceded by 30 seconds of one-screen instruction reading.
EEG signal’s high-frequency components comprising noise
and artifacts were discarded, and only low-frequency components obtained after a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) were
processed to the classification. Based on an interview with the
subjects who reported that the instruction reading was the most
stressful part of the experiment, it was concluded that only
the first 30 seconds of the recorded data were preprocessed
and processed for stress classification. Results show that k-NN
which reaches 72% outperforms LDA(60%) and ANN(44%)
in classifying stress.
Khosrowabadi et al. [10], discerned that the examination
period is the most stressful for students. Based on this fact,
they conducted their experiment during and after the examination period. Collecting EEG signals from 26 students (15
during examination period and 11 two weeks after). Data were
preprocessed to noise removal with an elliptic band-pass filter
(2-32 Hz). Three different features were investigated in this
work: Higuchi’s Fractal Dimension (HFD), Gaussian mixtures
of EEG spectrogram and Magnitude Square Coherence Estimation (MSCE). The classification step was handled using
k-NN and SVM classifiers. As a result, MSCE gives the best
accuracy up to 90% in classifying chronic mental stress. To
detect stress in healthy subjects, Norizam et al. [22] used in
their study a k-NN classifier and some parameters such as
Shannon Entropy (SE), Relative Spectral Centroid (RSC) and
Energy Ratio (ER). Their study employed 185 EEG data from
different experiments.
According to Table II, most of the previous works rely
on audio-visual stimulus from the international IAPS, IADS
databases [23]. Whereas, others used arithmetic tasks as practiced in [24] where the level of stress is supposed to increase
when the hardness level of tasks is increased. In our opinion,
mathematical tasks can not be realized by any person. Thus,
the experience is limited to specific participants. Let’s recall
that anxiety is felt by any person and our aim is to detect it
in all people without any restriction. The definition of anxious
states differs from a study to another. In our work, we will keep
the term anxiety and present its levels as recommended by our
therapist. For the classification, k-NN and SVM are popular
among all works. Therefore, we follow these works and use
them for the detection of anxiety levels. To add, we also
use Stacked Sparse AutoEncoder (SSAE) for the classification
step.
In this context, we rise the challenge of proposing a new
database 1 of EEG signals for anxiety levels detection. The
innovation of our work does not reside only in making public
EEG data for affective computing community but also in
the design of a psychological stimulation protocol providing
comfortable conditions for participants thanks to the face-toface interaction with the therapist and to the use of a wireless
EEG cap with lesser channels, i. e. only 14 dry electrodes.

III. E XPERIMENTAL PROTOCOL
A. Protocol description
We defined an experimental protocol that meets our needs.
After a discussion with a psychotherapist, she recommended
the use of exposure therapy. The latter is a form of the
well known Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Exposure
therapy involves starting with items and situations that cause
anxiety, but one that you feel able to tolerate [25]. There are
different forms of exposure, such as Imaginal Exposure, virtual
reality exposure, and in-vivo exposure. In our experimental
protocol we used the Flooding as in-vivo exposure therapy
[26], actual exposure to the feared stimulus. A patient is
confronted with a situation in which the stimulus that provoked
the original trauma is present. Regarding the conditions of
our experimentation, we used Flooding since it is quick and
usually effective.
The fixed protocol is as follows. Each participant is asked to
sign a consent before starting the experiment. The anxiety level
is calculated before stimulation according to the Hamilton
Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) in order to measure the
severity of participants’ anxiety. This tool provides 14 items,
each one contains a number of symptoms that can be rated on
a scale of zero to four.
Our psychotherapist inquires the participant about the degree of severity of each symptom and its rate on the scale,
with four being the most severe. This acquired data is used to
compute an overarching score that indicates a person’s anxiety
severity [27]. After which, the participant is prepared to start
the experiment, with closed eyes and minimizing gesture and
speech. The psychotherapist starts by reciting the first situation
and helps the subject to imagine it. This phase is divided into
two stages: recitation by the psychotherapist for the first 15
sec and Recall by the subject for the last 15 sec.

Fig. 1. The experimental protocol of anxiety stimulation

When time is over, the subject is asked to rate how he felt
during stimulation using the Self Assessment Manikin (SAM).
It has two rows for rating: Valence ranging from negative to
positive and Arousal ranging from calm to excited. Each row
contains nine items for rating. In order to evaluate the current
emotion, each volunteer has to tick items that are suitable
for emotion on only two dimensions (Arousal, valence). This
trial is repeated until the sixth situation. At the end of the
experiment, some items from HAM-A are re-evaluated by the
psychotherapist to adjust the participant’s anxiety level. All
steps of the protocol of stimulation is presented in Fig. 1.

B. Data analysis
Before the preprocessing phase, the data were evaluated
to eliminate those with large difference between expected
and real rating. In [28] [29], Russell defines anxiety as:
Low Valence and High Arousal. As a matter of fact, trials
having this condition and belonging to LVHA quadrant are
the main focus of our work as shown in Fig. 2. To analyze
data across all participants, we opt to measure the relative
variability by computing the Coefficient of Variation (CV) for
all participants’ ratings for all stimuli situations.

IV. M ATERIALS AND M ETHODS
This work covers all stages needed to create a robust EEGbased anxiety detection system, starting from the elaboration
of an anxiety stimulation experimental protocol to the classification of anxiety levels. The general architecture of the
proposed system is depicted in Fig. 3.
A. EEG recording

CV is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean
(average). If the calculated CV is equal to zero, it indicates
no variability whereas higher CVs indicate more variability.
The mean CV between the participants’ assessments was 0.58
for valence and 0.42 for arousal, which can be considered as
low variability. Note that this value is higher than expected. In
most cases, this variability is due to the lack of comprehension
of SAM scales leading to no objective rating. The mean rating
across all study participants for each stimuli case in terms of
valence and arousal are shown in Table V.
For each situation, the participant rating can be presented
in 2D plan corresponding to the valence and arousal values.
This plan can be divided into four quadrants according to
the possible combinations of valence and arousal scales. The
four quadrants as shown in Fig. 2 are: Low Valence and Low
Arousal (LVLA), High Valence and Low Arousal (HVLA),
Low Valence and High Arousal (LVHA), and High Valence
and High Arousal (HVHA). A summary of the subjective
classification into the four Valence-Arousal quadrants from
participants’ ratings is presented in Table III.
As shown in Fig. 2, samples are focused on LVHA and
LVLA quadrants, which proves that the employed situations
successfully worked in eliciting anxiety with most participants.
Table IV presents the number of participants classified by
anxiety levels based on HAM score before and after the
experiment.The number of participants with severe anxiety
increased from 7 to 13 denoting the impact of elicitation of
participants’ anxiety level.

The experiment was performed on 23 healthy subjects not
suffering from psychological diseases. 13 women and 10 men
with an average age of 30 years old. The purpose was clearly
explained to each participant before starting the experiment.
Items of the Hamilton test are highlighted to avoid misunderstanding each question. The experiment was performed in
an isolated environment to avoid distracting noises and to
guarantee a subject’s full concentration. The anxiety stimulation is accomplished by face-to-face psychological elicitation
performed in a professional manner by our psychotherapist.
EEG signals were recorded using a wireless EEG headset, the
Emotiv EPOC 14 channels and 2 mastoids [30] were placed
according to the international 10-20 system. The electrodes
were attached to the scalp at position AF3, F7,F3, FC5, T7,
P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8 and AF4 as shown in Fig.
4. he M1 mastoid sensor acts as a ground reference point
to compare the voltage of all other sensors, while the M2
mastoid sensor is an indirect reference to minimize electrical
interference from the outside. [5].
Emotiv Epoc neuro headset [30] is used in this work
regarding it’s easiness of use. It offers comfort to users and
mainly it is a wireless equipment and don’t require an intricate
set up like with clinical EEG material. In addition, it shows
efficiency while used for emotion recognition systems like
proved by [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] and more recently by [5]
[36].
The recording was performed through Emotiv Epoc Software for EEG raw data recording. It allows us to view and save
data for all channels or just customised the ones we need. The

5

produced raw data have ”.Edf” extension that is convertible
using matlab script to ”.mat” for further processing. The
recording started before carrying out the first situation and
ended after finishing the sixth one. Each recording took 6 min
as depicted in Fig. 1, divided into 1 min by trial. The acquired
EEG signals were processed at 128 Hz and impedance was
kept as low as 7 kΩ.
B. EEG preprocessing
In biomedical signal processing, the determination of noise
and artifacts in the acquired signal is necessary to move to the
feature extraction phase with a clean signal and achieve good
classification results. Physiological artifacts are generated by a
source different than the brain, such as electroculogram (EOG)
artifacts under 4 Hz, muscle artifacts (EMG) with frequency
exeeding 30 Hz, and heart rate ( electrocardiogram: EMG) of
about 1.2 Hz. They can also be extra physiological, unrelated
to the human body and are in the 50 Hz range. This may
be caused by the environment or related to EEG acquisition
parameters [23] [27] .
For the aim of denoising our set of signals, we have applied
an EEGLab script serving to cut relevant sub-band of EEG
signals, removing baseline and removing Ocular and Muscular

artifacts. A 4-45 hz Finite impulse response (FIR) pass-band
filter was applied to the raw data. The Automatic Artifact
removal for EEGLAB toolbox [37] (AAR) was used to remove
EOG and EMG artifacts.
This toolbox implements several algorithms for EMG and
EOG artifacts removal. We used the implementation of BSSCCA Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) which projects
the observed EEG data into maximally auto-correlated components [38]. We chose the criterion emg psd that considers
the components whose average power ratio in the typical EEG
and EMG bands is below certain threshold to be EMG-related
. In order to estimate the power in the EEG and EMG bands,
the default estimator used is a Hamming-windowed Welch
periodogram with segment length equal to the analysis window
length.
By default, the toolbox uses a combination of iWASOBI
which is an asymptotically optimal Blind Source Separation
(BSS) algorithm for autoregressive (AR) sources [39], and the
criterion eog fd to automatically correct EOG artifacts in the
EEG. Eog fd marks as artifactual the components with smaller
fractal dimension. Conceptually, components with low fractal
dimensions are those that are composed of few low-frequency
components [40]. This is often the case of ocular activity and
therefore it is a suitable criteria for detecting ocular (EOG)
components. The AAR toolbox offers a graphical interface,
but we recommend scripts that facilitate and automate the
denoising of all signals.
As mentioned, the experiment lasts almost 6 minutes divided into 6 different situations. We are only interested by
the first 30 seconds of each trial. 15 seconds of SAM are
removed during this step. As a result, we have 6 trials of
30 sec each per participant. We recall that, as shown in the
experiment protocol, after each 30 sec of stimulation the
participant is asked to fill in the SAM survey to express
in terms of excitement (Arousal) and feeling (Valence) his
emotions during the stimulation. And after the end of the
whole experiment, the participant is asked to identify the most

6

approaches were employed in the researches to extract this
type of features. In our work, we have extracted Hjorth features
and FD features:
1) Hjorth Features: Hjorth parameters [43] are: Activity,
Mobility, and Complexity. The variance of a time series
represents the activity parameter. The mobility parameter is
represented by the mean frequency, or the standard deviation
proportion of the power spectrum. Finally The complexity
parameter represents the variation in frequency. Besides, it
indicates the deviation of the slope.
Assume that dxi = xi+1 − xi0 (i = 1, .., n − 1), ddx =
dxi+1 − di0 (i = 1, .., n − 1).

Hjorth were used in many EEG studies such as in [44] [43]
[45]. In our work, we calculated Hjorth parameters for all EEG
channels, that produce a size Feature Vector of 42x1 for each
trial.
2) Fractal Dimension: The Higuchi algorithm calculates
fractal dimension value of time-series data. X (1), X (2),...,
X (N) is a finite set of time series samples. Then, the newly
constructed time series is defined as follows:

anxious situation. We used this information to label all trials.
By applying this labeling step, we get: 156 ’Normal’ trials,
90 ’Severe’ trials, 10 trials ’Moderate’ and 20 ’Light’ trials.
In order to increase the number of samples per participant, we
follow previous work [41] by constructing two additional sub
datasets for 5 seconds and 1 second trials extracted as sample
from the main EEG signal.
The labeling process is depicted in the Flow Chart of Fig.5.

V. F EATURE EXTRACTION
A wide range of EEG features for emotion recognition have
been investigated in the literature [42]. Generally, we can
classify these features into three main classes according to
the domain, namely, time-domain features, frequency-domain
features and time-frequency-domain features. Other features
can be extracted from a combination of electrodes, we mention
one of them in this section.
A. Time Domain Features
Time-domain features are results of an exploration of signal
characteristics that differ between emotional states. Many

where L(k) denotes the average value of Lm (k) , and a
relationship exists as follows:

(6)

Then, the fractal dimension can be obtained by logarithmic
plotting between different k and its associated L(k).
B. Frequency Domain Features
Band Power Power bands features are the most popular
features in the context of EEG-based emotion recognition. The
Definition of EEG frequency bands differs slightly between
studies. Commonly, they are defined as following: δ (1-4 Hz),
θ (4-8 Hz), α (8-13 Hz), β (13-32 Hz) and Γ (32-64 Hz).
The decomposition of the overall power in the EEG signal
into individual bands is commonly achieved through Fourier
transforms and related methods for spectral analysis [46] as
stated in [42]. Otherwise, short-time fourier transform (STFT)
[41] is the most commonly used alternatives, or the estimation
of power spectra density (PSD) using Welch’s method [20].

1) Hilbert-Huang Spectrum: The Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) along with the Hilbert-Huang Spectrum
(HHS) are considered as a new way to extract necessary
information from EEG signal since it defines amplitude and instantaneous frequency for each sample [47]. EMD decomposes
the EEG signal into a set of Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF)
through an automatic shifting process. Each IMF represents
different frequency components of original signals. EMD acts
as an adaptive high-pass filter. It shifts out the fastest changing
component first and as the level of IMF increases, the oscillation of the latter becomes smoother. Each component is bandlimited, which can reflect the characteristic of instantaneous
frequency [48].
x(t) is then represented as a sum of IMFs and the residual
[47].

In this work, we computed HHS for each signal using
the EMD to obtain a set of IMFs representing the original
signal. Extracted features are Hilbert Spectrum (HS) and
instantaneous energy density (IED) level. The decomposition
into IMfs resulted in 10 IMFs per each channel.
2) Band Power and RMS using DWT: Discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) is a recent technique of signal processing,
it proceeds by the decomposition of the signal into different
levels of approximation and detail corresponding to different
frequency bands. It also keeps the temporal information of the
signal. Compromise is done by downsampling the signal for
each level.
For example. Correspondence of frequency bands and
wavelet decomposition levels depends on the sampling frequency. In our case, the correspondent decomposition is given
in the last column of Table VI for fs = 128 Hz. In our approach,
in addition to the Band Power, the statistical feature Root
Mean Square (RMS) derived from a wavelet decomposition
with the function ’db5’ for 5 levels, is extracted for each
frequency band.

D. Other Features
1) Quantitative Features: In addition to the aforementioned
features, we adopted the set of features used in [50], which
include a variation of commonly used EEG features. However,
for some features we use all channels and bands unlike
in [50] in which, a reduction of features was applied by
averaging outputs. The feature set includes stationary features
that capture amplitude and frequency characteristics and interhemispheric connectivity features like shown in the Table VII.
The column FB indicate if features are generated for each
frequency band or not.
A feature vector resulting from this step containing a fusion
of all qEEG features, constructed for ulterior classification.
2) Differential Asymmetry: Frontal asymmetry (the relative
difference in power between two signals in different hemispheres) has been suggested as biomarker for anxiety [51]. In
different studies, FA was calculated from the beta band (1325 Hz) or the gamma band (> 30 Hz), but there are also
studies using the alpha (8-12 Hz) frequency band. Due to the
inverse relationship between alpha power and cortical activity,
decreased alpha power reflects increased anxiety [51].
Frontal asymmetry within the alpha band can be inversely
related to stress/anxiety [18] [6]. The feature was calculated
using alpha band power. The natural logarithm of left side
channels were subtracted from the right ones (L-R).

To calculate the asymmetry index, the continuous signal must
be broken into small parts. Scientific studies recommend
overlapping epochs with each limited to a duration of 12 seconds [41]. For each epoch a DWT is calculated. The
DWT determines which frequencies underlie the actual data,
allowing you to extract the power in a specific frequency band.

k-NN and SSAE.
A. Support Vector Machines
SVM [52] is known primarily as a binary classifier, while
it can complete a multilabel classification. Known by its
high generalization ability, it is tested and proven as a good
classifier [53]. Consider a training set (xj , yj ); 1 ≤ j ≤ N ,
where xj indicates the extracted EEG feature vectors, yj
denotes the corresponding labels, and N is the number of
data. The SVM decision function is expressed by the following
equation:
N
X
f (x) =
αi yi k(si , x) + b
(10)

anxiety levels.

i

x denotes the the input vector extracted from the EEG
signal, k is the kernel function, si indicates support vectors,
weights are denoted by αi and the bias is denoted by b. The
kernel of SVM used in this work is the Radial Basis Function
(RBF).
B. k-Nearest Neighbor
k-NN showed efficiency in EEG signal classification [54].
The k parameter is an integer constant always chosen par
the user, where new case will be assigned to the class most
common amongst its k nearest neighbours measured by an
Euclidean distance, or Manhattan, Minkowski, and Hamming
distances. k-NN have an issue in classifying unbalanced sets,
results can be influenced by the most dominant class.
C. Stacked Sparse Autoencoder
Autoencoders seek to use items like feature selection and
feature extraction to promote more efficient data coding.
Autoencoders often use a technique called backpropagation
to change weighted inputs, in order to achieve dimensionality reduction, which in a sense scales down the input for
corresponding results. A sparse autoencoder is one that has
small numbers of simultaneously active neural nodes. The data
processing in an auto-encoder network consists of two steps:
Encoding, where the original data x = [x(1) , x(2) , ..., x(m) ]T
are encoded from the input layer to the hidden layer :
y = f (x) = S(W x + b)

(11)

where y = [y (1) , y (2) , ..., y (n) ]T indicates the feature expression of the hidden layer; m is the number of nodes in the
input layer. n is the number of nodes in the output layer. W
denotes the weight matrix and b design the bias vector. S(x) is
the sigmoid function, which is expressed as S(x) = (1+e1−x ) .
Decoding, the feature expression y is decoded from the
hidden layer to the output layer:
0

z = g(y) = S(W T y + b )

(12)

The term Sparse AutoEncoder [55] is used when sparse
restrictions are added to the hidden noses of an autoencoder,
in order to control the number of activated neurons. Sparse
AutoEncoder shown better results in learning features regarding to its reduced number of activated neurons [56].

VII. A NXIETY DETECTION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The main aim of the current work is to provide a new
database for EEG-based anxiety detection. Therefore, to validate the proposed methodology three experiments basing on
trial duration were conducted. As a preliminary step, data
were labeled by applying an algorithm based on arousal and
valence values to handle two classification problems which are
anxiety two levels detection and anxiety four levels detection.
The number of trials for each class resulting from this step is
presented in Fig. 6 in term of distribution percentage leading
to unbalanced classes.
We believe that unbalanced data in the case of 4 anxiety
levels affects the classification results. So, we propose in order
to obtain a balanced data, to regroup classes two-by-two:
normal and light in the first class and moderate and severe
in the second class. The dataset becomes slightly unbalanced,
with samples amounting to 36% and 64% in average for
the first class (labeled light) and the second class (labeled
severe) respectively. Fig. 6 shows the overall class distribution
throughout the whole dataset for the two-class rating scale.
Classification was performed using a SVM classifier with
Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. It was trained and tested
in Matlab. Furthermore, a 5-fold cross validation technique
was used in order to validate the classification performance. It
must be noted that k-NN was also evaluated using the same
procedure, and happened in some cases to produce a more
significant results than SVM. We highlight that the task here
is subject-independent that means the training and test samples
does not belongs to the same subject.
Anxiety detection results for 4 levels are presented in Table
VIII. We report results obtained from different kind of features.
We remark that DWT-based RMS features with SVM achieve
the best results 59.10% and 65.30% for 15s and 5s trial
duration respectively. When the trial length is 1s, the result
is increased with k-NN classifier again with DWT-based RMS
features to reach 73.60%.
Table IX presents the results of two anxiety levels (light
and severe) detection. Power and RMS features obtained after
a DWT for the 15 s EEG signals give a significant rates
66.30%, 67.00% with SVM and k-NN classifiers, respectively.
For 5s Trial duration, 73.40% is achieved with DWT based
RMS features and k-NN classifier which slightly outperforms
the result 73.10% obtained with Power features and SVM

classifier. Classification accuracy reached 81.40% using Hjorth
parameters and k-NN classifier against 77.40% with DWT
based RMS features and SVM for 1s trial duration.
Through the aforementioned results, it is clear that detection
from one second trial length is more accurate and this is
related to the anxiety as an emotion. It can be evoked in
1s, but 5s or 15s are too long and may contain more than
one emotion. To add, we can notice that the best rates are
related to time-frequency features obtained after a wavelet
transform. Regardless of the trials’ duration, features produced
from a Hilbert Hung Transform and the set of quantitative EEG
features do not lead to a great accuracy, despite proving that
this approach outperform rates in many researches. Knowing
this, Hjorth parameters are the most simple features to extract
from an EEG signal, yet they produce a significant accuracy
throughout all types of datasets. For further study the impact of

feature type on the performance of the proposed system, Feature vectors from 1s trial are grouped by type and then passed
to SSAE. As the role of SSAE is the selection of the most
relevant features, we specified the size of both hidden layers
to be lower than the input size. Note that, a softmax layer
is added to perform the classification task. Table X depicts
the results obtained for Time, Frequency, Time-Frequency and
All Features. Frequency features outperform other types with
82% and 71.20% for 2 and 4 anxiety levels, respectively.
The highest accuracy is obtained with the combination of all
features to reach 83.50% for 2 anxiety levels and 74.60% for
4 anxiety levels.
While, the combination of features allows to provide rich
information, the representation generated by SSAE proved
their effectiveness in handling more discriminative aspect. The
result of 2 levels is higher than the 4 levels and this is mainly
to the increase of complexity aspect in the classification task.
VIII. C ONCLUSION
A novel approach to anxiety elicitation based on a faceto-face psychological stimulation has been presented in this
paper. A dataset was constructed containing EEG data gathered
during the experimentation. We present insights to analyze
acquired data showing the efficiency of the followed strategy.
The approach showed success in inducing anxiety levels,
which was validated by HAM-A Test Scores calculated before
and after the experiment.
A various sets of emotion recognition features and in
particular anxiety/stress, based on EEG signal, are reviewed
and applied in this paper. We presented the most popular
feature extraction techniques from the wide range used in the
literature. Some methods perform slightly better than others.
We also investigated which trial durations are most promising
and which features are most effective for it.
To the best of our knowledge, there are no available
databases that contain EEG data recorded with a portable devices. The headset Emotiv Epoc used in our work is available
for everyone and is easy to install and use. Patients can use
it at home and check their stress levels without consulting
an expert. Many clinical applications can be derived from this
work improving life quality and reducing cognitive disabilities.
