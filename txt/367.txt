Abstract
The use of mindfulness meditation (MM) in the treatment of problem gambling (PG), has
been used effectively for over five years. However, the neural mechanisms responsible for the
improvements are unknown. The literature describes healthy individuals with an increase in
alpha power and a decrease in alpha frequency after eight weeks of mindfulness meditation, but
it is unknown if changes are similar amongst individuals with PG. Using resting-state
electroencephalography (rsEEG), we measured the changes in alpha oscillations before and after
an eight-week mindfulness meditation intervention (MMi) and a pre/ post-five-minute
mindfulness meditation body scan (MMb). For people with PG, we observed an increase in alpha
power and decreased alpha peak frequency after the MMi, while the inverse was true for the
MMb. The most considerable alpha rhythm changes occurred in the frontal and temporal lobes,
areas sensitive to reward and sensory processing in PG. Our observed changes may reflect
theories that MMi for PG may improve attentional control as hypothesized by previous research
in alpha oscillations and cue-reward processing.
Introduction

Mindfulness meditation (MM) has been used in conjunction with cognitive behavioural
therapy as a treatment for individuals with problem gambling (PG) (Chen et al., 2014). In
healthy individuals, eight weeks of MM results in a decreased alpha frequency and an increase in
alpha amplitude (Cahn & Polich, 2006). We measured the alpha oscillations of PG to determine
if an eight-week mindfulness meditation intervention (MMi) results in similar alpha changes.
The study we have conducted is the first to analyze resting-state electroencephalography (rsEEG)

data for this treatment group (PG). A small body of rsEEG research discusses alpha amplitude
and frequency amongst those with PG (Cahn & Polich, 2006; Guo et al., 2017). Missing from the
literature are the changes in alpha oscillations after a mindfulness meditation (MM) for treatment
of PG. This novel study will contribute to the understanding of the currently unknown neural
mechanisms of MM and PG treatment.
The MMi is founded on mindfulness-based cognitive therapy protocols that have been
used as one of the treatment options for mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety and
problem gambling (Barnhofer et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2014). Individuals who have participated
in an MMi for PG reported improved control over gambling, greater task-specific attention and
reduced automatic thought patterns (Chen et al., 2014). Traditionally, an MMi consists of eight
weekly sessions, however, mindfulness is also practiced with a five-minute mindfulness
meditation body scan (MMb). The MMb is a tool taught and practiced as a component of the
MMi. It was hypothesized that an individual could learn to control alpha oscillations with the
MMb by purposefully attending to externally cued locations of the body (Kerr et al., 2013).
Changes in alpha oscillations are measured by shifts in alpha peak frequency and alpha
amplitude. rsEEG measures alpha amplitude and frequency changes by recording summed
electrical activity on the surface of the scalp. Neurological activity is measured in the unit of
power, or microvolts squared (μV2). Microvolts are transformed from the time domain to the
frequency domain through a calculation called the Fast Fourier Transform (Akin, 2002). The
Fast Fourier Transform is an algorithm that samples a signal over a period of time and divides it
into single sinusoidal oscillations at specific frequencies each with their own amplitude (Akin,
2002). The distance from one peak of a wave to the another is termed amplitude (μV). Amplitude
squared is termed power (μV2). The rhythmic activity of waves in the frequency that range

between 8-14 Hz is referred to as the alpha wave. The alpha wave contains the most power
amongst delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma identified in the brain (Kilmesch, 2012). The alpha
rhythm has been found to be a marker of spontaneous cell firing which occurs during inactivity
(Adrian & Matthews, 2010). The alpha rhythm disappears when the eyes are opened and during
concentrated attention when the eyes are closed (Adrian & Matthews, 2010).
As alpha amplitude increases, weak cells are inhibited from firing, and blood flow
decreases in the cortical area. As alpha amplitude increases, task-irrelevant stimuli from the
external environment is filtered from cognitive processing (Klimesch, 2012). As cortical
activation decreases, a selection of attentional resources occurs, and task-irrelevant information
from the external environment is filtered. Alternatively, alpha amplitude decrease occurs as cell
inhibition is released and cortical activity increases (Klimesch, 2012). With increased cortical
activity, inhibition of sensory stimuli is difficult and reflected in decreased alpha amplitude
(Klimesch, 2012).
The MMb may be used as a tool to control the regulation of thalamocortical activity by
purposefully attending to parts of the body (Kerr et al., 2013). Alpha oscillations reflect changes
in thalamic-cortical activity (Klimesch, 1999). The thalamus acts as a relay centre sending
sensory input to different parts of the cortex. By controlling the regulation of thalamocortical
activation loops, one may be able to modulate the transfer of sensory input received from the
environment.
Changes in alpha frequency sub-bands reflect different cognitive processes, arousal (11 to
14 Hz), attention (9 to 10 Hz) and memories (7 to 8 Hz) (Klimesch, 2012; see Appendix). An
increase in alpha frequency is associated with improved cognitive performance and memory
(Klimesch, 1999). Alpha frequency is higher in childhood to early adulthood and decreases with
aging (Chiang, 2011). Low alpha frequencies have been noted in individuals with low IQ and/or
neurodegenerative diseases (Duffy et al., 1984; Nimmrich et al., 2015). More recently, cortical

alpha has been shown to predict the confidence in an impending action (Kubanek et al., 2015)
which could reflect motor preparation of an impending action (DeSouza et al., 2003) or motor
efference copy signals (DeSouza et al., 2000; DeSouza et al., 2002) which also employ
thalamocortical loops.
PG has displayed lower alpha amplitude in the left frontal (F7) and temporal (T7) lobe
and activation of reward centres during high-risk decision making (Miedl et al., 2014). MM has
resulted in an alpha power increase in the frontal and temporal lobes in healthy individuals (Cahn
& Polich, 2006). MM has also resulted in a reduced neurological response to rewards (Tang et
al., 2009). PG exhibits a dysregulation in neural networks involved in gambling-related cue and
reward responses (Murch & Clark, 2015). External stimuli from gambling such as lights or noise
produce physiological sensations. The insula is sensitive to physiological signals and encodes an
emotion via the amygdala to be later recalled by the hippocampus (Davis & Whalen, 2001;
Gupta et al., 2011). PG has shown to create a heightened sensitivity to triggering cues,
previously associated with gambling, resulting in physiological arousal. Conditioned gambling
cues activate the mesolimbic system, resulting in cravings for gambling-related rewards (Tang et
al., 2015). Attentional bias towards gambling cues occurs with PG (Janssen et al., 2015; Murch
& Clark, 2015). Greater internalized control over attention to gambling-related cues may be
beneficial in the prevention of PG behaviours. It has been hypothesized MMi compliments
treatment for PG because it leads to greater attentional control over internal and external stimuli
(Chen et al., 2014). Internalized control over attention to external stimuli is also positively
correlated with alpha oscillations (Klimesch, 2012) and thus our examination of the neural
mechanisms in this report.
rsEEG data was collected in two separate conditions, eye’s open (EO) and eye’s closed
(EC) for 6-minutes. The EO and EC conditions reflect different measures of baseline alpha

activity (Barry et al., 2007; Adrian & Matthews, 2010). In the EO condition, visual stimulation
leads to information processing and global activation of the cortex (VaezMousavi et al., 2007).
The EO condition is a better measure of the resting state baseline while visual processing takes
place before a task-specific situation (VaezMousavi et al., 2007). The EC condition measures
arousal or one’s energetic state at a given moment (VaezMousavi et al., 2007) and would use
differing corticothalamic loops than with EC. The EC condition putatively leads to a decrease in
cortical activation and alpha waves are more dominant (Barry et al., 2007). rsEEG data was
collected and analyzed in both conditions (EO/EC) to compare and contrast different aspects of
the dynamics of alpha oscillations. Alpha frequency should be higher in the EO condition than
the EC condition due to the visual processing and heightened cortical activity.
Methods:
rsEEG recordings used an Epoc Emotiv 14 channel headset with TestBench, the
accompanying software that displays and records rsEEG data. Saline solution was applied to the
felt tips of the EEG headset, the participant’s head was measured, and the headset was placed on
the head in accordance with electrode measurement positions: AF3, AF4, F3, F4, F7, F8, FC5,
FC6, P7, P8, T7, T8, O1, O2 and reference electrodes at P3/P4, based on the modified
combinatorial nomenclature system (Adjouadi et al., 2004). Sensors were adjusted to ensure the
best impedance. Participants were instructed to look at a cross displayed on a laptop screen in
front of them via MediaLab software (v2012). A three-minute recording collected rsEEG data
once with the participant’s eyes open (EO) and once with the participant’s eyes closed (EC).
Data markers were set to indicate the beginning and end of the EO and EC conditions, sent by
Virtual Serial Port Driver (Version 7.1, Eltima Software, 2013, Bellevue, WA) to TestBench and
saved as an EDF file (Di Nota et al., 2017).

A total of 28 self-selected volunteers with PG took part in this study. Compensation of
$40 was provided to each participant before and after the MMi. Participants completed a
mindfulness-based body scan (MMb). The MMb was led by a clinician or researcher with more
than ten years of MM practice. The participants were then briefed on the MMb, and the lights in

the room were dimmed. Participants were invited to sit in a chair and close their eyes if it suited
their comfort. Next, participants were instructed to bring their attention to each part of their body
from toe to head beginning with the left or right side, chosen by the instructor. Participants were
asked to direct attention to the physical body or their breath upon awareness of internal thought
dialogue. Upon completion of the five-minute MMb, the lights were turned on, and rsEEG data
was collected for the second time (t2). Participants then took part in an eight-week MMi led by a
clinician at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) services in Toronto, Ontario.
The MMi was led in accordance with mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and mindfulnessbased relapse prevention protocols. Post MMi, participants returned to CAMH for data
collection. Participants first completed the STROOP test, followed by rsEEG data collection (t3),
an MMb, then a fourth data collection point (t4).

Data Preprocessing
Six minutes of rsEEG data were preprocessed into two-second epochs using the Fieldtrip
toolbox (Oostenvelde et al., 2011) in Matlab v7.12.0, R2011a (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick,
MA). An independent component analysis on the Fourier transform of EEG signal was used to
reject artifacts. Components were visually inspected before rejection. Artifacts were removed,
due to putative eye blinks, muscular movements and signal noise. Power spectrum data was
transformed using a fast Fourier transformation (for data pipeline see https://

Data Analysis
Alpha power was log-transformed for statistical normalization. Data was then imported to
SPSS v24 for analysis. A linear mixed model was used to accommodate for missing cells of data
across the sample size (n=28) and random effects (Aarts et al., 2014; Wang & Goonewardene,
2004). Time was treated as a continuous variable, and subject variables were fixed. The model
assigned each participant their own point on the y-intercept which randomly deviates from the
group mean at each time interval along the x-axis. The factor analytic, first order covariance
structure was used to accommodate unequally spaced time intervals with maximum likelihood
(ML) estimation. Histograms were created, and normality was assessed. Model fit was assessed
with Akaike information criterion (Akaike, 2011). Post-hoc mean comparisons were made using
the Bonferroni adjustment.
The model had a total of eight repeated measures observations per participant (4-time
intervals x 2 EO/EC conditions). Level one consisted of participants (N=28). In level two, each
participant had two pairs of data collection pre- and post MMi, creating unequally spaced time
intervals. Time point one (t1) consisted of rsEEG data collection, followed by a five-minute
MMb at time point two (t2). A second rsEEG measurement was taken immediately after. Time
point three (t3) and time point four (t4) consisted of the same pattern of data collection after the
MMi.
Missing data (MAR) was <5% of cases. An unbalanced data set was due to participant
drop out, failure of EEG marker transfer to TestBench, unresolved errors and muscular artifacts
or noise creating unusable rsEEG data. With unbalanced data sets, estimates of fixed effects are

based on the maximum and minimum likelihood methods (ML) (Field, 2013). The ML
estimation of variance was selected for its robustness as compared to the restricted maximum
likelihood method (REML) when looking at fixed effects (Field, 2013). We hypothesized that
the group of participants, the fixed effect, would show a change in alpha oscillations over time,
therefore use of the ML was appropriate.

Results
Electrodes in the left and right frontal and temporal areas changed after the MMi and
MMb (see Figure 1). We hypothesized an increase in alpha power and decrease in alpha
frequency after the MMi and MMb. After the MMi, a significant increase in alpha power and a
decrease in frequency was observed, however, after the MMb, the inverse was observed (see
Figure 2).

Discussion
We hypothesized an increase in alpha power and decrease in alpha frequency after the
MMi and MMb in the frontal and temporal lobes in people with PG. The overall trend after the
MMi of an increase in alpha power and a decrease in frequency was observed, however, the
inverse was true after the MMb. Individual electrodes in the fronto-central and temporal regions
changed significantly as predicted based on previous research in normal people undergoing
mindfulness meditation.

Mindfulness meditation intervention - MMi
Frequency (Hz)
After the MMi, a decrease in frequency was observed in the left and right frontal lobes
(F7 and F8) in the EO condition. The EO condition represents visual processing before a taskspecific situation with heightened activation of the entire cortex (Barry et al., 2007). Our results
suggest a reduction in cortical activity in the frontal lobes during visual processing before a taskspecific situation. A decrease in frequency was also found in the left and right temporal lobes
(T7 and T8) in the EC condition. The EC condition represents internal arousal or energetic state
at any given moment (VaezMousavi et al., 2007).
Reduced frequency in the temporal lobes may represent a reduction in sensory
information transfer at any given moment. Previous research has hypothesized that theT8
represents a gating mechanism for incoming sensory information to be relayed to the cortex
(Jensen & Mazaheri 2010; Klimesch, 2007). Changes in alpha frequency reflect attentional
resources and the transfer of sensory information to the cortex (Klimesch, 2012).

After the MMi, a significant decrease in alpha frequency was found in the left frontal and
temporal areas (F7 and T7) in the EO and EC conditions respectively. Previous studies have
shown these areas to be overactive with a low alpha amplitude during risky decision making
(Miedl et al., 2014). The decrease in alpha frequency may result in lower cortical activation of
areas related to high-risk decision making. A lower frequency in F7 and T7 may represent less
information transfer between the sensory system and the cortex. iwPG have a strong reaction to
gambling cues attended to by the sensory system and hypersensitivity of cortical areas involved
in risk and reward. MMi may benefit iwPG when presented with a gambling cue by improved
attentional control over task-irrelevant sensory stimuli.
Frequency decrease was also found amongst electrodes and FC6 and AF4, the right
fronto-central and front-most electrodes. These results coincide with changes found amongst
healthy individuals after eight weeks of MM. The asymmetric changes warrant further research
on iwPG.

Log alpha power (µV2)
F8 and FC6 increased in amplitude after the MMi. Previous studies have found alpha
amplitude to be positively correlated with internalized control over attendance to the taskirrelevant sensory processing of environmental stimuli. Greater attentional control would be
beneficial for iwPG who show attentional bias to gambling-related cues in the environment.

Mindfulness meditation body scan - MMb
Alpha Frequency (Hz)
The trend of alpha frequency increase was observed after the MMb in both the EC and
EO conditions. However, a significant decrease in frequency in electrode AF3 was identified. A
significant effect of time was observed in FC6, but post hoc comparisons failed to identify the
time interval. This may have been due to our very conservative criteria of multiple comparisons
employing the Bonferonni correction. FC6 increases after the MMb, however, the significance of
the time period is unknown. As a trend, more electrodes saw an increase in frequency after the
MMb than not. Significant changes in electrodes FC6 and AF4 with significant post hoc
comparisons in AF4 result in the observation in the right frontal lobes changes in frequency over
time, with a decrease in AF4 after the MMb. Alpha peak frequency has been hypothesized to
represent the transfer of sensory information from the thalamus to the cortex (Klimesch, 1999).
Our results may represent the cognitive processing that occurs during the MMb as one
purposefully directs attention to each body part across time at the direction of the instructor
(authors FJ and K-LM). Usually, the thalamus inhibits the senses of the external body until
required, so the MMb requires increased attentional demands and cognitive processing upon
direction from the instructor. It was hypothesized that the MMb might be used as a tool to learn
to control alpha oscillations, by regulation of communication between the thalamus and the
cortex (Kerr et, al. 2013). Over time the use of this tool may provide greater control over
attendance to or suppression of irrelevant sensory input that is required in addiction research in
our population and could also be applied to others.

A decrease in alpha amplitude was observed after the MMb. A decrease in amplitude
putatively results in released inhibition of neuronal firing, increased cortical activity and
cognitive performance. The improved cognitive performance may be beneficial for iwPG who
display gambling related thinking distortions that have been shown to decrease with rational
thought (Emond & Marmurek, 2010). For example, if one is tempted to gamble, a five-minute
body scan phone app could be a useful tool to improve cognitive clarity and increase rational
thinking as opposed to automatic thinking.
Alpha power decrease may have also occurred as participants think about body
movement. For example, as attention is directed from one body part to another, or the
practitioner suggests subject’s direct attention to the chest as it moves in and out while breathing.
Alpha power decrease has been found when one cognitively prepares for movement (Brinkman
et al., 2014).
All observed changes in alpha oscillations that occurred in the subbands may be related to
attention (9 to 10 Hz) and memory (7-8 Hz). We plan to conduct follow-up studies to analyze
working memory and attention in more detail.
Limitations of our initial preliminary study include the lack of a control group; however,
future research is planned in the next stage. The changes in alpha amplitude and frequency,
amongst iwPG after an MMi, are not yet found in the literature. The results assist in
understanding neural changes after MM practices in iwPG. Future research may investigate
whether MMi for iwPG could lead to better internalized control over cues that lead to problem
gambling actions (Kubanek et al., 2015). It has been hypothesized that PG occurs with a strong
cue-related craving during high-risk decision making (Miedl et al., 2014). iwPG show attentional
bias to gambling-related cues relayed to the cortex by the sensory system (Tang et al., 2015). The

MMi may provide protection from PG by unconsciously reducing attendance to environmental
cues that trigger cravings and behaviour. The MMb may be a tool one can consciously
implement to improve problematic gambling behaviours.
