Abstract: This study aims to investigate the perceived images of Eastern and Southeastern Anatolia regions in
Turkey. These regions offer many opportunities in terms of history and culture, nature and food tourism. Using EEG and
Eye Tracker devices, these two destinations, where potential tourists are blurred, and the two destinations where there
are no clashes, measured levels of arousal, interest and negative value against the destination advertisements. It has
been found that, with the discovery of an important element in the conflicts in the two conflicting destinations, tourists
could take a small amount of risk with the intention of discovering new destinations.

1. Introduction
Destination branding has received considerable interest from researchers since the early 1970s
(Hunt, 1971; Mayo, 1973; Gallarza et al., 2002; Pike, 2002; Martín and Rodríguez del Bosque, 2008; Dolnicar
and Grün, 2013; Stepchenkova and Li, 2014).
Destination development and destination branding activities start with building a favourable
destination image that identifies and differentiates the destination from its competitors (Aaker, 1991; Cai,
2002). A destination’s image can be regarded as the pre-existing concept/s corresponding to that particular
destination (Pike, 2009). In fact, a destination image is “the sum of beliefs, ideas, and impressions that a
person has of a destination” (Crompton, 1979, p. 18).
The image of a destination brand can also be described as the “perceptions about the place as
reflected by the associations held in tourists’ memory” (Cai, 2002, p. 723). Many researchers view destination
image as a critical part of a brand, reflected by a set of brand associations (Keller, 1993; Tasci and Kozak,
2006; Stepchenkova and Mills, 2010; Stepchenkova and Li, 2014; Taşkın and Karadamar, 2016a). This means
that the image of a destination forms the basis of competitive positioning in terms of what destination offers
need to be communicated both efficiently and effectively to selected target markets (Day et al., 2002; Morgan

and Pritchard, 2002; Koc, 2009; Datzira-Masip and Poluzzi, 2014; Taşkın and Karadamar, 2016b). A strong and
favourable destination image reinforces a positive brand identity (Qu et al., 2011; Benedetti et al., 2011).
A destination’s image is formed based on a combination of information elements such as tourists’
past experience, knowledge, experiences, planned and non-planned marketing communications including
word of mouth communications (Stepchenkova and Li, 2014). As holiday decisions are complex and risky,
tourists engage in extended information search and generally use a variety of sources of information before
making their holiday decisions (Koc, 2000 and 2009; Sirakaya and Woodside, 2005).
2. The Main Thrust of and the Rationale for the Study
Tourism industry can make a significant contribution to the diversification of the economy and may
help alleviate regional imbalances. Besides tourism industry can provide an export opportunity which is
subject to relatively high growth rates and is less constrained (e.g. greater price flexibility and better
employment opportunities) than the more traditional forms of export (Fletcher, 1995). Moreover, tourism is
an important industry especially for a country like Turkey due to Turkey’s high multiplier value. According to
Fletcher’s (1995) tourism multiplier league, tourism activity in Turkey was found to have the highest
multiplier value (1,96) in the world to be followed by the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Egypt, with values
1.73, 1.72 and 1.23 respectively. According to a study by SKIFT (2015), an industry intelligence and marketing
platform in travel and tourism, after Spain and Italy, Turkey was the third most searched country on the
Internet in terms of tourism related searches, though in terms of the overall country brand strength shows
that Turkey was able to be only among the top fifteen countries in the world (SKIFT, 2015). According to
World Economic Forum (WEF) Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report (2015) the effectiveness of Turkey’s
marketing and branding strategy was poor with a figure of 4.8 (10 being the best). Turkey was the 58 th
country in the world, out of 141 countries, in terms of the effectiveness of marketing and branding of the
country as a destination.
Moreover, Turkish tourism faces major competition and it is highly vulnerable. Turkish tourism
industry figures show that the tourism activity in Turkey is highly seasonal and it is mainly based on one
tourism product, sun and sea tourism. Approximately 70 % of tourism revenues are earned from tourists
visiting Turkey between the months of April and October for sun and sea holidays.
In addition, although the number of tourists visiting Turkey has increased over the years, per person
tourist spending has declined (Koc and Altinay, 2007). This is partly to do with insufficient destination
development. In general Turkish destinations tend to be underdeveloped and do not have much on offer to
keep tourists engaged. Average nights tourists spent/stay in Turkey is only about three days (The Turkish
State Institute of Statistics, 2015), compared with, for instance the UK, with an average nights spent figure of
six (EUROSTAT, 2013).
International tourism trends show that tourists are moving away from, General Interest Tourism
(GIT), i.e. sun and sea type of tourism (Krippendorf, 1987a and b). Culligan (1992) suggests that the tourist’s
increasing desire for more novel, adventurous, and ‘authentic’ forms of tourism experience is a function of
the decline in utility associated with a decision to simply replicate previous experience. This means that there
is a move away from General Interest Tourism towards Special Interest Tourism (SIT) (Brotherton and
Himmetoglu, 1997). For instance, according to World Tourism Organization whilst the nature tourism
represents 8% of total tourism activity, as a segment it has grown three times faster than overall GIT (WTO,
2009). Turkey appears to have a strong potential in terms of cultural tourism due to its rich cultural resources
(World Economic Forum, 2015). The country may benefit from this segment which is estimated to grow 15%
per annum in the future. This figure is three times the rate of growth of general tourism (AOIFE, 2007).
Moreover, as another important SIT segment food tourism has also grown 30% in the world over the past
decade (Stanley and Stanley, 2014).
It may be suggested that new product and destination development are two significant challenges
Turkish tourism industry needs to confront based on above explanations. This study aims to explore the
present images of Eastern and South-eastern Anatolia regions as the two conflict-ridden destinations in
534

Turkey, in comparison with the Mediterranean and Aegean regions as the two non-conflicted, peaceful
destinations. As the conflict-ridden Eastern and South-eastern Anatolia regions are mostly undiscovered
destinations by many tourists, the study particularly aims to unveil the images held in the minds of tourists
with a view to provide managers with information which may be of use in making their destination
development, positioning and branding decisions. These two regions collectively were classified as conflictridden places with level 4 intensity (meaning limited war) in the Heidelberg Institute for International
Research report (Conflict Barometer, 2013). According to Economic Forum (WEF) Travel & Tourism
Competitiveness Report (2015), which identifies the safety and security as one of the most significant issues
in tourism development, Turkey, with an average figure of 4.2, ranks as the 121st country in terms of safety
and security. This low safety and security figure is primarily due to the terrorism incidents in and relating to
the Eastern and South-eastern Anatolia regions in Turkey. However, there is a distinction in terms of the
terrorism activity between these two regions, where Eastern Anatolia region is relatively much safer than the
South-Eastern Anatolia region.
Turkish tourism represents about 7 % of all world tourism activity in the world (WTO, 2014) according
to World Tourism Organization’s Tourism Highlights report (2014) with 37.8 million international tourists.
This figure makes Turkey the sixth country in the world in terms of the number of international tourist arrivals
(WTO, 2014). A significant proportion of Turkish landmass (about 28.5 %) lies in the Eastern and Southeastern Anatolia regions of Turkey. These two regions collectively have a landmass of approximately 228
thousand square kilometres, an area almost twice the size of the total landmass of the Netherlands, Belgium
and Switzerland.
The Eastern and South-eastern Anatolia regions in Turkey are to a large extent untouched and
undiscovered by both domestic and international tourists. These two regions housed many civilizations from
Urartu to Mesopotamian such as Sumer and the Akkadian, Babylonian, Elam and Assyrian. The world’s oldest
temple in the world, Gobekli Tepe is in Sanliurfa, a city in South-eastern Turkey. This temple dates back to
B.C. 11000, i.e. about 6000 years older than Stonehenge in the U.K. There are two UNESCO World Heritage
cultural sites in the region, one being Diyarbakir Fortress and Hevsel Gardens Cultural Landscape and the
other one being Nemrut Dagi (UNESCO, 2015a). The city of Gaziantep in this region was listed in the Creative
Cities Network by UNESCO under the category of gastronomy in 2015. It is the only Turkish city listed in the
Creative Cities Network and there are only ten cities in the world listed under the gastronomy category of
UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UNESCO, 2015b). The region has many natural beauties too, such as Mount
Ararat (5137 meters high) which is believed to be the landing place of Noah's ark, according to the biblical
story, and the Lake Van, the largest alkaline lake in the world (Evliyaoglu, 1994).
This huge area in the Eastern and South-eastern Anatolia regions has been almost completely
excluded from any tourism activity since the establishment of PKK (Partiya Karkerên Kurdistan - The Workers
Party of Kurdistan) in 1978. Since then a total of more than twelve thousand lives were lost including the
security forces and the civilians. The total economic cost of the conflict was estimated to be $350 billion
between the years of 1979 and 2009. However, a roadmap for a peace process has recently started. The
roadmap has already produced extremely positive consequences such as the decrease in the number of killed
security staff, custodies and instigations. These positive developments in the form of a de-escalation of the
conflict, are reflected in the Heidelberg Institute for International Research’s report (Conflict Barometer,
2014) too, as the intensity level of conflict decreased from 4 (meaning limited war) in 2013 to 3 (meaning
violent crisis) in 2014. However, some extremely severe terrorist activities, aimed at both the security forces
and the civilians, started recently right after the national elections on 7th June 2015, both in the conflictridden regions and in various other parts of Turkey, after a reasonable period of tranquillity starting in 2009
with the establishment of National Unity and Brotherhood project (Sayari, 2016).
Based on the above, it could be stated that there are two main thrusts of this study. First, the two
conflict-ridden regions in Turkey have a significant potential for both domestic and international tourism.
Alongside general interest tourism, as a growing special interest tourism segment these regions could well
be designed and marketed as cultural/historical, natural, and food tourism destinations (Isaac and Cakmak,
2014). Second, tourism activities may help the formation and the spreading of positive opinions about these

regions (Cakmak and Issac, 2012) and support the acceleration of the peace process. The starting of peace
process is important as Gallup’s Positive Experience Index (referred to as Global Happiness Index) (GALLUP,
2015) emphasized that positive experience index scores (level of happiness) was the lowest in conflict-ridden
countries. According to this survey among 148 nations in the world, Turkey with the score of 54 was the third
least happy nation, being only slightly happier than countries like Tunisia and Sudan with scores of 52 and 47
respectively.
3. Destination Image and Destination Positioning
Three main components of destination branding identified in Jing and Rong’s (2010) research are i)
the development of products intimately connected with the destination; ii) efforts to develop a positive and
attractive image; and iii) targeted marketing activities supported by appropriate marketing mix elements. A
positive image of a destination is expected to facilitate the inflow of investments, knowledge, employees,
tourists, and new businesses to the destination among competitive destinations (Clark, 2006).
Gnoth (2007) states that a destination brand encompasses cultural, social, natural, and economic
values. Compared with tangible product brands, service brands, such as destinations should convey more
than just the functional elements of the brand (Költringer and Dickinger, 2015), as the image of destination
includes not only tangible and verifiable destination attributes, but also perceptions of more psychological
nature and emotions regarding that destination (Echtner and Ritchie, 1991).
As many destinations are substitutable, due to the similarity of the features they have, a particular
attention needs to be paid to the differentiation of the image of the destination in line with its’ positioning
(Pike, 2005). In general destination positioning studies focus on image as the key construct (Uysal et al.,
2000; Chen and Uysal, 2002; Gallarza et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2005; Pike and Ryan, 2004). It is important for
destination to create a distinctive image in the minds of its potential customers. Failing to do so may cause
an ambiguous perception in the minds of the customers and an inability compete with the direct competitors
of this destination (Gartner, 1989; Gallarza et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2005; Jeuring, 2015). It must be kept in
mind that efficient and effective positioning of a destination could be a major source of competitive
advantage (Kim et al. 2005; Kavaratzis and Ashworth, 2007; Pike, 2009; Turok, 2009; Braun, 2012; Zenker and
Beckmann, 2013; Braun et al., 2014; Artal-Tur and Kozak, 2015).
4. Risk Perception and Conflict-Ridden Destinations
The main difficulties of destination branding are often associated with the complexity of tourism
decisions as a destination primarily is an intangible and risky product (Cai, 2002). The possibility of risk cannot
be completely avoided when purchasing a holiday, as it always involves a level of outcome uncertainty (Björk
and Kauppinen-Räisänen, 2012). This is mainly to do with the fact that the tourist purchases an intangible
service, an experience, and the service purchased cannot be experienced until after its purchase and use
(Fakeye and Crompton, 1991; Boksberger and Craig-Smith, 2006; Björk and Kauppinen-Räisänen, 2012).
The subjective judgment of the possibility of an adverse outcome may be defined as perceived risk
(Brun, 1994; Aven and Renn, 2009). The perception of the possibility of threat and danger may significantly
influence tourists’ holiday purchase decisions (Mansfeld, 2006; Reichel et al., 2007; Chew and Jahari, 2014).
Perception of risk starts with the tourist’s decision to visit a particular destination (Reisinger and Mavondo,
2005). In many instances, the quality and the quantity of information provided by various sources (Koc, 2002;
Kozak and Kozak, 2008) and past experience of a destination may decrease the tourist’s perception of risk.
As Tversk and Kahneman’s (1992) Prospect Theory puts forward people tend to put much more emphasis on
the probability of negative outcomes (the probability of losing) than the probability of positive outcomes (the
probability of winning).
Yet, by just participating in even many risk-free mainstream tourism activities, tourists may come
across a variety of types of risks. In general, most holidays involve encounters with the unknown in terms of
destinations, accommodation, and transport (Witt and Moutinho, 1995; Simpson and Siguaw, 2008; Fuchs
and Reichel, 2011; Fuchs, 2013). The specific service features such as intangibility, inseparability, variability
536

C. Taskin – E. Koc – H. Boz

and perishability tend to increase the perception of risk as they may pose additional threats to tourists
(Grönroos, 1990, Grönroos, 2007, Lovelock and Wirtz, 2007; Zeithaml et al; 2006; Seabra et al., 2013).
Besides, tourists may also take further risks by participating in extreme sports and risky recreational activities,
in which risk can be a vital component of creating memorable and satisfying experiences (Piekarz et al., 2015).
Yet, the safety of a destination remains as a central issue for tourists (Pizam et al., 1997) and
determines holiday decisions significantly (Sonmez and Graefe, 1998a; Pearce, 1998; Mawby, 2000; George,
2003; Lepp and Gibson, 2003; Eitzinger and Wiedemann, 2007; George; 2010; Woosnam et al., 2015) whether
to make a purchase or not. In fact, above all a destination’s success is primarily dependent on the risk
perceptions of tourists (Beirman, 2003).
There have been numerous studies to explore tourists’ perception of risk (Verhage et al., 1990; Pizam
and Mansfield, 1996; Dolnicar, 2005; Fuchs and Reichel, 2011; Björk and Kauppinen-Räisänen, 2012; Seabra
et al., 2013; Bellhassen et al., 2014). Terrorism and socio-cultural risk appear to be the most significant
predictors of risk perception and travel anxiety (Hall, 2002; Lean and Smyth, 2009; Hall, 2010; Fuchs and
Reichel, 2011; Ozcan and Erdogan, 2015). The fragile geopolitical situation and political violence in many
parts of the world increase interest in safety not by just academics but by policy makers and legislators too
(Pizam and Mansfield, 1996; Prideaux and Master, 2001; Shin, 2005; Fuchs and Reichel, 2011). For instance,
since March 2014, the assaults carried out by Islamic State alone has caused the killing of 650 people in cities
such as Algeria, Canada, Egypt, Brussels, Istanbul, Paris and Ankara. The safety concerns are especially high
for destinations that are under constant threat caused by geo-political unrest and acts of terror. It is believed
that for these volatile destinations understanding tourists’ risk perception may help marketers in formulating
marketing strategies that will take into account the various dimensions of risk perceptions and that will
mitigate some of the psychological barriers to travel (Fuchs and Reichel, 2011).According to WEF Travel and
Tourism Competitiveness Report (2015) political unrest in the Middle East significantly influenced tourism
activities in the region while benefitting neighbouring countries like Turkey as tourists saw these countries as
alternatives to experience Middle Eastern flair and ancient sights. Though, recent attacks since 2014 by the
Islamic State showed that, it is not only the Middle East that is unsafe to travel to.
A particular destination may be considered highly risky due to a recent political unrest or a terrorist
attack (Sonmez and Graefe, (1998a).The political unrest, conflict, violence and terrorist attacks in a particular
destination may have severe impacts on tourism (Hall, 1994; Hall and O’Sullivan, 1996; Pizam et al., 1997;
Richter and Waugh, 1986; Roehl, 1995; Sonmez, 1998; Cakmak and Isaac, 2012; Belhassen et al., 2014).
Research shows that tourists form images of a destination in their minds based on their perception of risk
(Kozak and Kozak, 2008; Björk and Kauppinen-Räisänen, 2012).
During the 1st Gulf Crisis in 1991, after Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, tourist arrivals to Turkey from OECD
(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries declined about 36% (Ekzen, 2004),
although the instability was not directly related to Turkey. During the Gulf Crisis although the distance
between the invaded city of Kuwait and Antalya, Turkey, the nearest popular destination for tourists was
more than 2500 kilometres, the arrival of tourists to destination almost completely stopped due to rising
risk perceptions of tourists. This means that the political instability and the ensuing threat perception can
significantly influence the risk perceptions of tourists and cause a significant decline in the tourism activity
both in the short and long run ((Wieviorka, 1994; Mansfeld, 2006; Hall and O’Sullivan, 1996; Lea, 1996; Pitts,
1996; Seddighi et al., 2001; Timothy et al., 2004; Neumayer, 2004; Arana and Leon, 2008; McDowell, 2008;
Noy and Kohn, 2010; Simone-Charteris and Boyd, 2010; Causevic, 2011; Bellhassen et al., 2014; Chew and
Jahari, 2014).
The fact that the distance between the invaded city of Kuwait and Antalya, the nearest popular
destination in Turkey for visitors from OECD countries, is more than 2500 kilometres, shows the vehement
influence of risk perception on tourism activities. As this particular example demonstrates political instability
can not only easily reduce tourism activity in the short run, but may also influence the image of a destination
in the medium to long run (Hall and O’Sullivan, 1996; Neumayer, 2004; Mansfeld, 2006; Noy and Kohn, 2010;
Simone-Charteris and Boyd, 2010; Bellhassen et al., 2014; Chew and Jahari, 2014).

According to Blain et al. (2005) the brand promise regarding a destination is important as it assures
tourist in terms of the potential of pleasant and memorable holiday experience. Hence, apart from reducing
the perception of various types of risks which may be associated with destination, a favourable image of a
destination also provides assurance to tourist about the fact that the destination has the potential to meet
the expectations of tourists(Berry, 2000; Chew and Jahari, 2014; Wong and Teoh, 2015).
5. Methodology
The validity and objectivity of research can be increased by the collecting data from a number of
sources (Smith, 1975; Babbie, 1983; Phillips, 1985; Cheng, 2005; Bogdan and Biklen, 2006). As stated above
Koc and Boz’s, (2014b) found a limited use of the combined methods (triangulation in tourism research (Koc,
2015b) a shortage of the combination of methods (triangulation) used in tourism and hospitality research. In
social research data collected from the participants may not reflect the truth as the participants may have
certain hidden motives of which they may be unaware of. Additionally, due to impression management
motives, i.e. the participants’ desire to provide responses which may enable them to make a good impression
on others also cause responses which may be far from the reality (Koc and Boz, 2014a; Boz, 2015).
Quite often the data collected through the accounts and evaluations of the participants may not
reflect actual truth. This may be due to i) participants in research studies may have hidden motives, which
even they themselves may not be aware of (Goffman, 1959; Koc and Boz, 2014a; Boz, 2015) To ensure the
objectivity of the study two devices of EEG (Electroencephalogram) and Eye Tracker were used in conjunction
with one another.
The purpose of this study was to measure the responses of the participants towards marketing stimuli
about both conflict-ridden and non-conflict-ridden destinations by using two sensors of EEG
(Electroencephalogram) and Eye Tracker. The EEG headset and Eye Tracker devices have been widely used
by neuromarketers to record consumers’ psychophysiological responses towards marketing stimuli, due to
their ease of use (Gordon and Ciorciari, 2017)
The Eye Tracker sensor data allow decision makers to identify how much a person concentrated on
various parts of a destination advertisement and where in a particular destination advertisement a potential
s/he has looked at first (the order).
Data collected by using EEG headset device allows decision makers to determine arousal (excitement,
liking and disliking), boredom /disinterest-engagement/interest, frustration, meditation/relaxation levels of
tourists when looking at a particular section or a marketing cue in the advertisement. The right frontal EEG
activation is associated with emotions of negative valence (disliking, disinterest, frustration and boredom) in
the participants and left frontal EEG activation is associated with emotions of more positive valence (liking,
interest/engagement, excitement).
6. Marketing Stimuli used in the Study
The marketing stimuli included package holiday advertisements for four regions (two of which
conflicted and the other too being non-conflicted regions) with both visual and verbal cues (See Figure 1).
Visual cues included food, nature and historical photo images relating to the particular destination for which
participants’ perceptions were aimed to be measured. Verbal cues included the name of the package tour
(e.g. Eastern Anatolia Region) and the names of the cities to be visited in the package tour. The package
holidays were similar to the brochure and the Internet advertisements for these types of holidays, except
that the advertisements did not contain many details including pricing and payment so as to eliminate the
influence of various factors outside the scope of this study. The EEG data both before and after the exposure
to the package holiday advertisement were analyzed by using ERPs (Event Even Related Potentials (ERPs), i.e.
the measured brain response that are the direct result of a specific sensory, cognitive, or motor event (Luck,
2014).

7. Subjects / Participants
For the study data were obtained from 21 right handed subjects between 2nd and 15th May, 2015,
during the period of tranquillity, before the latest serious terrorist attacks in Turkey following the national
elections on 7th June 2015. The use of right handed participants is due to the fact that these individuals are
more likely to perform a specific task in either the right or left hemisphere in the brain. On the other hand,
left handed people are more likely to perform a specific task equally both in their right and the left
hemisphere’s (Martin and Jones, 2009). The participants were chosen from people who never went to the
conflict-ridden regions nor had any close relationship with these regions. In order to avoid bias participants
were chosen from voluntary potential tourists selected from the customer databank of a travel agency. The
participants were not paid for taking part in the study.
The ages of the participants ranged from 20 to 53 years old. All subjects voluntarily participated in
the experiment. Subjects had no previous history of any psychiatric, psychological and neurological disorders,
and no alcohol or drug dependence. Of the 21 participants 15 of them were males and 6 of them were
females. The sample size may be thought to be limited for traditional questionnaire surveys. However, there
are many neuromarketing studies similar sample sizes such as Hedgcock et al., 2012; Valenzi et al., 2014;
Dimpfel, 2015; Falk et al., 2010 and Menéndez, 2015). Before the start of the experiment, each participant
was informed briefly about the study procedure and the EEG and Eye Tracker devices.
8. The Task and Experimental Procedure
In order to explore the images potential tourists may have for the conflict-ridden destinations in
Turkey (Eastern and South-eastern Anatolia regions) promotional materials (destination advertisements)
with visual and written verbal cues were prepared and pilot tested. Promotional materials (destination
advertisements) with visual and verbal cues were designed for two conflict-ridden and two non-conflictridden (peaceful) regions in Turkey, Eastern Anatolia, South-eastern Anatolia, Aegean and Mediterranean
regions respectively.
Each region was thought as a destination and advertisements were organised around separate
package tours for each destination region. As mentioned above the package tour holiday comprised verbal
messages including the names of the cities in the region with visual images focusing on themes of based on
the themes of historical sightseeing, local food and natural beauties in these regions, due to the growth rate
of these segments, as explained above in the literature.
Figure 1. Flowchart of the Experiment

The participants in the experiment were shown four package holiday stimuli, i.e. destination
advertisements (as shown in Figure 1) (both from the conflicted regions of Eastern and South-Eastern
Anatolia and non-conflicted regions of the Aegean and Mediterranean in Turkey) and their emotions were
detected simultaneously using the Affectiv SuiteTM software (for monitoring the user's emotional states)

After the placement of EEG, HR and GSR apparatuses subjects were asked to take a comfortable
position and relax. Participants ran the experiment individually using a mouse to answer
assessment questionnaires.
First visual destination marketing material was shown five seconds after the experiment started.
During these five seconds the participants were shown a black screen.
After having being exposed to marketing stimuli participants were asked to make an evaluation
for duration of ten seconds and indicate their responses on the screen by using the mouse.
The participants indicated their responses on a Likert scale A -4 (minus four) score meant “I
definitely did not like this holiday advertisement?” or “I would definitely not purchase this
holiday” and a score of +4 meant “I definitely liked this holiday” or “I would definitely buy this
holiday” on the screen with the mouse.

Each visual destination marketing material was shown for a duration of 20 seconds.
Between each of the four destination marketing advertisements the participants were shown a
black screen for five seconds.

As explained and shown in Figure 1 and Table 1 above during the experimental procedure the
participants were shown initially black screen as a baseline procedure to determine each participant’s
“resting state” for five seconds by using EEG. The emotion elicitation started following the baseline
procedure. During this stage the participants were shown the package holiday advertisements randomly so
as to eliminate the order effect. The emotion elicitation process lasted 20 seconds. After viewing a package
holiday advertisement for 20 seconds, each participant was given 10 seconds to respond to a self-report
questionnaire shown on the screen to indicate her/his emotional state by using a computer mouse. In
particular, the participant was asked to indicate the degree of pleasantness of the advertisement and her/his
purchase intention for that particular package holiday advertised on 9 point scale. After the completion of
each questionnaire following each package holiday advertisement, the participant was shown the next
package holiday advertisement.
9. Findings and Analysis
The first analysis of the study was based on the survey responses of the participants’ on the degree
of pleasantness (two questions) and their purchase intentions (2 questions) for each package holiday
advertisement they viewed for 20 seconds. The participants indicated their responses by using their mouse
on the options shown on the computer screen by using the mouse. The responses ranged from “I did not like
it at all” (for pleasantness) and “I definitely do not wish to purchase” (purchase intention) (-4) to “I liked it
very much” (for pleasantness) and “I definitely wish to purchase” (purchase intention) (4).

Table 2 shows a comparison of liking and purchase intentions of the participants for conflicted and nonconflicted, i.e. peaceful, regions based on their own evaluations. The second row of the table shows their
purchasing intentions of the participants who liked the particular package holiday, and the third row shows
a ratio of this.

It can be seen in Table 2 that both liking and purchase intentions of the participants for non-conflictridden / peaceful destinations (Aegean the Mediterranean region) are significantly higher (almost 100%) than
for conflict-ridden destinations (Eastern and South-eastern Anatolia Regions). This may be attributable to the
risk perceptions of tourists regarding the conflict-ridden destinations even after a reasonable period of
tranquillity. This finding is in line with many previous research studies mentioned above (Pizam et al., 1997;
Sonmez and Graefe, 1998; Pearce, 1998; Mawby, 2000; George, 2003; Beirman, 2003; Lepp and Gibson,
2003; Eitzinger and Wiedemann, 2007; George; 2010; Woosnam et al., 2015). In other words, it can be stated
that physical risk may decrease liking and purchase intentions of a destination (Hall, 1994; Hall and O’Sullivan,
1996; Pizam et al., 1997; Richter and Waugh, 1986; Roehl, 1995; Sonmez, 1998c; Neumayer, 2004; Cakmak
and Isaac, 2012; Bellhassen et al., 2014). A high level of risk perception even after a reasonable period of
tranquillity, between 2009 and 2015, may be attributed to cultural characteristics. According to Hofstede’s
cross-cultural dimensions, in general Turkish culture may be classified as a highly risk averse culture (with a
score of 85) and low indulgence culture, i.e. a restrained culture (with a score of 49) (Hofstede et al, 2015).
In restrained cultures (as opposed to indulgence) in general people are more likely to remember negative
emotions (Hofstede et al, 2015).
A paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare the periods prior to the showing of each
destination advertisement and the actual period the destination advertisement is shown in terms of arousal,
interest and negative valence scores. According to the test results there were no significant differences in the
scores for arousal prior to the period of the Eastern Anatolia region package holiday advertisement is shown
(M=40,11, SD= 11,88) and the Eastern Anatolia region package holiday advertisement is shown (M=42,60,
SD= 11,83); t(20)= -,630, p= ,54, the period prior to the Aegean region package holiday advertisement is
shown (M=50,30, SD= 17,45) and the period the Aegean region package holiday advertisement is shown
(M=47,64, SD= 11,05); t(20)= ,782, p= ,443, the period prior to the South-Eastern Anatolia region package
holiday advertisement is shown (M= 43,68, SD= 12,69) and the period the South-eastern Anatolia region
package holiday advertisement is shown (M=42,89, SD= 14,65); t(20)= ,264, p= ,794 and the period of the
Mediterranean region advertisement is shown (M= 55,12, SD= 17,76) and the period the Mediterranean
region advertisement is shown (M=49,73, SD= 15,87); t(20)= 1,750, p= ,095.
The above figures of arousal shows that the average level of arousal for the advertisements of
conflicted regions (the Eastern Anatolia: 42,60 and the South-eastern Anatolia:42.89) is much lower than the
average level of arousal for the non-conflicted regions (the Aegean: 47,64 and the Mediterranean: 49,73).

Perceptual Image of Conflict-Ridden Destinations: An EEG and Eye Tracker Analysis

This finding is in line with the findings of a number of studies which found that changes in experienced
joyfulness resulted in higher levels of arousal (Jong-Meyer, 1990 and 1991; Simons et al., 1999; Reeves, Lang,
Kim, & Tatar, 1999; Lang et al., 1999 and 2000; Bolls et al., 2001).
According to the test results there were no significant differences in the scores of interest prior to
the period of the Eastern Anatolia region package holiday advertisement (M=76,57, SD= 11,29) and the
period Eastern Anatolia advertisement package holiday advertisement is shown (M=76,14, SD= 12,69); t(20)=
,198, p= ,845, the period prior to the showing of Aegean region package holiday advertisement is shown
(M=75,00, SD= 11,15) and the period the Aegean region package holiday advertisement is shown (M=71,57,
SD= 11,05); t(20)= 2,073, p= ,051, the period prior the South-eastern Anatolia region package holiday
advertisement is shown (M= 70,23, SD= 12,17) and the period the South-eastern Anatolia package holiday
advertisement is shown (M=66,95, SD= 11,59); t(20)= 1,842, p= ,080, the period prior to the Mediterranean
region package holiday advertisement is shown (M= 68,57, SD= 8,46) and the period the Mediterranean
region package holiday advertisement is shown (M= 67,52, SD= 7,69); t(20)= ,732, p= ,473.
An analysis of the above figures show that the highest average level of interest was for the Eastern
Anatolia Region (76, 14) and the lowest level of interest was for the South Eastern Anatolia Region (66, 95).
As explained in the literature, though some terrorism activity occurs from time to time in the Eastern Anatolia
Region, it is much safer than the South Eastern Anatolia region. The interest levels for two non-conflicted
regions (i.e. the Aegean and the Mediterranean) are lower (71, 75 and 67, 72 respectively) than the Eastern
Anatolia region. As explained in the literature this may be attributable to the decline in utility associated with
a decision to simply replicate previous experience as these regions may have been visited by tourist for sun
and sea tourism activities frequently (Krippendorf, 1987a and b; Culligan, 1992; Brotherton and Himmetoglu,
1997; Koc, 2005). The highest average level of interest for the Eastern Anatolia Region may mean that tourist
may overlook small amount of risk at the expense of exploring new destinations.
According to the test results there were no significant differences in the scores for negative valence
(frustration) prior to the period of the Eastern Anatolia region package holiday advertisement is shown
(M=65,34, SD= 17,97) and the period the Eastern Anatolia region package holiday advertisement is shown
(M=57,86, SD= 15,21); t(20)= 1,443, p= ,165 and period prior to the Aegean region package holiday
advertisement is shown (M= 65,99, SD= 12,99) and the period the Aegean region package holiday
advertisement is shown (M=62,43, SD= 12,61); t(20)= ,943, p= ,357. There were significant differences
between the period prior to the South-eastern Anatolia region package holiday advertisement is shown (M=
60,44, SD= 12,06) and the period South-eastern Anatolia Region package holiday advertisement is shown
(M=53,09, SD= 10,81); t(20)= 2,18, p= ,041, the period prior to the Mediterranean region package holiday
advertisement is shown (M= 63,34, SD= 17,75) and the period the Mediterranean region package holiday
advertisement is shown (M= 52,60, SD= 12,32); t(20)= 2,542, p= ,019.

Figures 2 and 3 shows the heat / attention map data collected by the Eye Tracker and together with
data collected by EEG device for the destinations Eastern Anatolia, the Aegean, the South-eastern Anatolia
and the Mediterranean regions respectively. As stated in the methodology section the participants were
shown a black screen for five seconds before each advertising stimuli i.e., destination advertisements (vertical
lines separating the showing of each stimuli - 0-5, 25-30, 50-55 and 75-80 seconds) to eliminate cross
influences.
Figure 2. Number of Eye Fixations

Figures 2 and 3 show that participants had the highest level of arousals when they were looking at
advertisements of non-conflict-ridden destinations, i.e. the Aegean and Mediterranean regions. When
average arousal figures were presented above it was seen that the average level of arousal for conflicted
regions (the Eastern Anatolia: 42,60 and the South-eastern Anatolia:42.89) is much lower than the average
level of arousal for the non-conflicted regions (the Aegean: 47,64 and the Mediterranean: 49,73). It was
stated above that this finding was in line with a number of studies such as Jong-Meyer, 1990 and 1991;
Simons et al., 1999; Reeves, Lang, Kim, & Tatar, 1999; Lang et al., 1999 and 2000; Bolls et al., 2001).

Perceptual Image of Conflict-Ridden Destinations: An EEG and Eye Tracker Analysis

The Pearson correlation analysis shows that there was a significant correlation between the level of
pleasantness and purchase intention and moderate level of correlation with interest (r=-,56, p<0,01, r2=0,31)
and arousal (r=,67, p<0,01, r2=0,45). A positive high level of correlation is normally expected between
pleasantness and arousal (Vecchiato et al., 2015).
Additionally, the level of interest is negatively significant correlated with level of arousal (r=-,21,
p<0,05, r2=0,04). There was small correlation between arousal and the level of interest and negative valence.
The level of interest, the level of negative valence (r=,47, p<0,01, r2=0,22) were positively significantly
correlated.
Research shows that there is positive relationship between the level of arousal of consumers and
their intention to make a purchase (Baker et al., 1992; Sheng and Joginapelly, 2012). Moreover, the feeling
of pleasure also influences intention to make a purchase (Baker et al., 1992; Sheng and Joginapelly, 2012).
When consumers are exposed to a pleasant marketing stimuli, their level of interest and engagement appear
to increase (Lang, 1995). However, negative stimuli alos increase the level of arousal of consumers but leads
to negative feelings such as frustration or anxiety (Lang, 1995; Sheng and Joginapelly, 2012).
A heat map was produced based on the data collected. The heat map shows the emotional responses
of the participants towards the visual marketing stimuli they were exposed to.
Figure 3. Heat map of the Participants towards Destination Advertisements

The data collected through the Eye Tracker device (Figures 2 and 3) shows that in general total
fixation periods for verbal cues were relatively significantly higher than all other features of the
advertisements. The findings bear similarities with Rayner et al.’s (2001 and 2008) and Lykins et al’s. (2006)
neuromarketing studies which investigated the evaluations of participants in terms of whether they found a
particular advertisement pleasant and whether they would buy that particular product or service advertised
(i.e. their purchase intentions). In Rayner et al.’s (2001 and 2008) findings demonstrated that when customers
were asked to make a purchase they tended to look at text stimuli more often than the pictorial stimuli
provided in the advertisement. However, when customers were asked to evaluate the pleasantness or
effectiveness of the advertisements, they tended to fixate more on the pictorial stimuli than the text stimuli
in the advertisements (Seo et al., 2010). Hence, the increased number of fixations may be due to the amount
of attention a customer pays to a stimuli (Lykins et al., 2006; Rayner et al., 2008; Deans et al., 2010; Seo et
al., 2010). Hence, the increased number of eye fixations in this study may be due to the need to read (Seo et
al., 2010; Ho and Chua, 2013). Total amount of the eye resting on visual stimuli shows the fact that the
customer is interested in the specific stimuli (Lykins et al., 2006; Seo et al., 2010).

Fixation periods at the verbal cues in the advertisements may be to do with the loss aversion
motivation (Kahneman and Tversky, 1992) of participants as details to pay attention are usually in written
details in the advertisements. Emotions can perhaps be better expressed through photos, while facts relating
to terms and conditions can be better expressed though verbal cues (Koc, 2000). This is reasonable, although
holidays are hedonic experiences, they can be high risk purchases as explained above (Fakeye and Crompton,
1991; Sirakaya and Woodside, 2005; Boksberger and Craig-Smith, 2006; Björk and Kauppinen-Räisänen,
2012; Fyall et al., 2012; Wong and Teoh, 2015).
This is due to the fact that tourism decisions involve high level of various types of risks (e.g.
physiological, financial, social, psychological and time) (Hall, 1994; Hall and O’Sullivan, 1996; Pizam et al.,
1997; Richter and Waugh, 1986; Roehl, 1995; Sonmez, 1998a; Neumayer, 2004; Cakmak and Isaac, 2012;
Bellhassen et al., 2014). However, it is interesting to see that in general the fixation periods on verbal cues
were relatively high. The total fixation duration for the conflict-ridden destinations is relatively lower
compared with the total fixation duration for the non-conflict-ridden destinations. This may be due to the
risk associated with the conflict-ridden destinations. The participants may not really think of going to these
destinations as a holiday option and hence concentrate more on the verbal cues of non-conflict ridden
destinations.
The fixation count data show variations among the destinations. The number of fixations on history
and culture photos of conflict-ridden destinations (162) is higher than the number of fixations on history and
culture photos of non-conflict-ridden destinations (134). The total fixation duration for conflict-ridden
destinations is also higher (45105 ms) than the total fixation duration for non-conflict-ridden destinations
(39639 ms). This may attributable to the fact that the historical and cultural features of the conflicted
destinations are mostly unknown for most tourists. Tourists may be curious to explore the undiscovered
historical and cultural aspects of the conflicted destinations (Eastern and South-eastern Anatolia regions).
Tourists may be more familiar with the historical and cultural features of the non-conflict-ridden destinations.
For both non-conflict-ridden and non-conflict-ridden destinations both the number of fixations and
the duration of fixations were relatively lower for food photos. This may be attributable to two factors. First,
as a concept the culinary or food tourism has not yet developed sufficiently in Turkey. Second, as there is a
widespread tradition of all-inclusive holidays, and in general tourists in Turkey tend to have an extensive
experience of these types of holidays and they may not believe that they will really find local and ethnic
cuisine in these holidays. Due to widespread experience of all-inclusive type of lodging tourists may expect
to find standard food they may get anywhere else in Turkey. As discussed in the literature review
(Krippendorf, 1987a and b; Zauhar, 1994) there is a need for the development of various types of special
interest tourism products and special interest tourism destinations in Turkey. Based on this finding it may be
suggested that in both conflict-ridden and non-conflict-ridden regions the hospitality establishments may
concentrate on their menus and try to offer ethnic and exotic meals. It may be especially the case for the
conflict-ridden regions as these regions offer extensive opportunities from a food tourism perspective.
Hence, the conflict-ridden destinations may be suggested to position themselves around food and culinary
tourism and avoid all-inclusive type of lodgement. The findings of this study are parallel with the findings of
a number of neuromarketing studies (e.g. Goldberg et al., 1999; Bialkova and van Trijp, 2010; Bialkova and
van Trijp, 2011; Graham and Jeffery, 2012; Van Loo et al., 2015; Samant and Seo, 2016) which found that
participants spent longer time in looking at items that they considered purchasing.
10. Conclusions
The results of the study show the significant influence of risk and danger on the perceptual image of
a destination. It is also seen that although the risk associated with a conflict-ridden destination may be fairly
permanent, tourists may overlook a lower level of risk at the expense of discovering new destinations.
Tourist’s average level of interest for the Eastern Anatolia, a relatively safer region of the two conflicted
regions, was the highest.

Perceptual Image of Conflict-Ridden Destinations: An EEG and Eye Tracker Analysis

One strategy for the destination planners and practitioners may be to allow a longer period of time to fade
away the risk and danger associated with a conflict-ridden destination. Destination planners and practitioners
may then start developing destination image and related positioning strategies.
An additional strategy may be to start destination development activities as soon as possible in these
two conflicted regions. The association of risk and danger with a conflict-ridden destination, even after a
reasonable period of peace and calmness, may be to do with priming in the minds of potential tourists. This
means that with a Pavlovian conditioning, whenever a conflict-ridden destination is mentioned, individuals
may tend to produce pre-recorded risk and danger related responses. The practitioners may be
recommended to carry out marketing communications activities to eliminate the priming in the minds of
potential tourists. Additionally, policy makers may concentrate on organizing festivals and various events to
reduce the perception of risks associated with these regions.
As holidays are risky purchases and risky aspects of holidays tend to be communicated through verbal
cues rather than visual cues (photos), tourists tend to concentrate more on verbal cues. For this reason,
destination planners and managers in holiday establishments, both in conflict-ridden and non-conflict –
ridden destinations, are advised to pay a particular attention to the planning and designing of verbal cues.
Additionally, in line with recent trends in tourism activity in terms of a move from GIT to SIT, tourists tend to
pay more attention to cultural and historical aspects of a destination, rather than the features of a holiday
establishment. Hence practitioners may be recommended to concentrate more on the historical and cultural
aspects of a destination.
The findings of the study show that although tourists may be curious to explore the conflict-ridden
destinations of Eastern and South-eastern Anatolia they are still wary of the risks. Had the study been
implemented after the severe attacks following the national elections in Turkey on 7th June 2015, the level of
risk tourists felt would have been significantly higher. It may also be recommended that the two conflictridden destinations of Eastern and South-eastern Anatolia may be best positioned around the theme of
cultural and natural tourism. Although this region is famous for its rich variety of ethnic and exotic foods, as
Turkish tourists have extensive experience of open buffet all-inclusive package holidays, tourists do not tend
to be convinced by ethnic and exotic food claims. This may also be to do with the fact that food and culinary
tourism has not yet developed in Turkey. The practitioners may be recommended to work on developing
food and culinary tourism market in Turkey, not only for domestic tourists, but also for international tourists
too.
