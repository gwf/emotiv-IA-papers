Abstract

15
16

BACKGROUND: Commercially-made low-cost electroencephalography (EEG)

17

devices have become increasingly available over the last decade. One of these

18

devices, Emotiv EPOC, is currently used in a wide variety of settings, including brain-

19

computer interface (BCI) and cognitive neuroscience research.

20

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to chart peer-reviewed reports of Emotiv

21

EPOC projects to provide an informed summary on the use of this device for

22

scientific purposes.

23

METHODS: We followed a five-stage methodological framework for a scoping

24

review that included a systematic search using the Preferred Reporting Items for

25

Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-

26

ScR) guidelines. We searched the following electronic databases: PsychINFO,

27

MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore. We charted study data

28

according to application (BCI, clinical, signal processing, experimental research, and

29

validation) and location of use (as indexed by the first author’s address).

30

RESULTS: We identified 382 relevant studies. The top five publishing countries

31

were the United States (n = 35), India (n = 25), China (n = 20), Poland (n = 17), and

32

Pakistan (n = 17). The top five publishing cities were Islamabad (n = 11), Singapore

33

(n = 10), Cairo, Sydney, and Bandung (n = 7 each). Most of these studies used

34

Emotiv EPOC for BCI purposes (n = 277), followed by experimental research (n =

35

51). Thirty-one studies were aimed at validating EPOC as an EEG device and a

36

handful of studies used EPOC for improving EEG signal processing (n = 12) or for

37

clinical purposes (n = 11).

38

CONCLUSIONS: In its first 10 years, Emotiv EPOC has been used around the world

39

in diverse applications, from control of robotic limbs and wheelchairs to user

Introduction
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a continuous recording of the electrical

46

activity generated by groups of neurons firing in the brain. An EEG typically

47

comprises recordings of activity present at multiple sites on the head, indexed using

48

metal electrodes placed on the scalp. EEG recordings can be inspected by sight for

49

signs of brain dysfunction (e.g., epilepsy), or can be processed to produce spectral

50

analyses of the electrical activity over a period of time, and event-related potentials

51

(ERPs) that reflect the average pattern of electrical activity generated by a particular

52

stimulus (e.g., a speech sound, a face, a written word).

53

EEG is one of the oldest neuroscientific techniques in use today. Since the

54

first human recordings published by Hans Berger in 1929 [see 1, for a history], EEG

55

has become a popular tool for neuroscientists due to its non-invasive nature and

56

high temporal resolution. The technique has matured over the decades due to

57

advances in technology, which has allowed for greater instrument sensitivity and

58

better signal processing techniques. What used to be analogue signals scribed onto

59

rolls of paper are now digital recordings stored on hard drives, ready for processing

60

using a myriad statistical and mathematical techniques.

61

In recent years, one of the biggest evolutions in EEG applications has been

62

the development of consumer-grade devices. Not only do these devices make

63

acquiring EEG signals easier, but they can do so in natural environments outside the

64

traditional laboratory setting. In 2009, a biotech company, Emotiv Systems, released

65

EPOC, a consumer-oriented EEG device. EPOC was originally designed and

66

marketed as a hands-free videogame device, placing it within the class of brain-

67

computer interface (BCI) devices. As one of the first EEG devices available to

68

consumers, EPOC’s release demonstrated the feasibility of low-cost neuroimaging

69

outside of research laboratories. The next 10 years saw the EPOC developer re-

70

established as Emotiv Inc., a second iteration of the device called EPOC+, and the

71

market of EPOC evolve to include research applications. Neuroscientists, keen to

72

take advantage of efficiency increases and budget decreases, saw an opportunity in

73

EPOC for user-friendly research at a fraction of the cost of traditional research-grade

74

EEG systems.

75

In the decade since its release, EPOC has been used in hundreds of scientific

76

applications as its ease of setup and low price-point make it an appealing option for

77

researchers and engineers. The first published works using EPOC appeared in

78

2010, describing the use of EPOC in BCI applications [2-4]. In 2011, the first study

79

using for experimental research was published [5]. Two years later, studies

80

validating the use of EPOC in experimental research began to emerge [6-8]. In the

81

years that followed, EPOC appeared in many conference proceedings and journal

82

articles, suggesting its wide adoption as an EEG device. In our laboratory, we have

83

successfully converted the EPOC into an ERP device, which we have validated

84

against a research-grade system [8-10]. In addition, our department has integrated

85

EPOC into the Bachelor of Cognitive and Brain Sciences as a practical

86

demonstration of neuroscience methodology [11].

87

Given the demonstrated validity of the EPOC as a research tool, as well as its

88

low cost, researchers around the world are understandably curious about what the

89

EPOC system can and cannot be used for. This has inspired a number of reviews of

90

EPOC's use in specific domains such as BCI [12-17], cognitive enhancement [18,

91

19], stress detection [20], and education [21]. However, no review has considered

92

the use of the EPOC across multiple domains. In addition, while other reviews have

93

focused on portable EEG devices in general [22-26], none have focused on the

94

EPOC device specifically.

95

With this gap in knowledge in mind, we aimed to carry out a scoping review of

96

studies that have used the EPOC as an EEG and ERP device to understand the use

97

and location of EPOC research to date. We followed the framework put forth by

98

Arksey and O'Malley (27 p. 21) for conducting a scoping review, where, in contrast to

99

a systematic review, a scoping review does not seek to answer a narrowly-defined

100

research question but to examine and describe the “extent, range, and nature of

101

research activity”. We followed the five stages described by Arksey and O'Malley

102

(27), which were:

103

Stage 1: identifying the research question.

104

Stage 2: identifying relevant studies.

105

Stage 3: study selection.

106

Stage 4: charting the data.

107

Stage 5: collating, summarising, and reporting the results.

108

Additionally, we followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic

109

Reviews and Meta-analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR)

110

guidelines [28]. See supporting information (S1 PRISMA-ScR) for the checklist.

111
112

Stage 1: Identifying the Research Question
We sought to answer the question of where (i.e., locations) and how (i.e.,

113

applications) EPOC has been used in research settings. In addressing this question,

114

we aim to facilitate decision-making about EPOC useability and expect this review

115

may be particularly beneficial for researchers who are searching for inexpensive

116

neuroscience techniques. It may also be useful for clinicians in the development of

117

BCI-assisted technologies that support people with physical limitations.

118
119

Emotiv EPOC
There have been two versions of Emotiv’s device, EPOC and EPOC+. The

120

primary difference is that EPOC+ can capture data at 128 Hz and 256 Hz sampling

121

rates whereas EPOC samples at 128 Hz only. We reviewed projects using both

122

devices in this scoping review, but for simplicity we will refer to both versions as

123

EPOC.

124
125

Stage 2: Identifying Relevant Studies
The first author conducted a systematic search of the literature by retrieving

126

records from the following online bibliographic databases: (a) PsychINFO, (b)

127

MEDLINE, (c) Embase, (d) Web of Science, and (e) IEEE Xplore. These widely-used

128

databases cover a large breadth of fields, including psychology, cognitive science,

129

medicine, and engineering. Searches included peer-reviewed studies conducted with

130

human participants and written in English. Searches included studies published from

131

2009 onwards (i.e., the year EPOC was released). To find records in each database,

132

we used the following search strings in conjunction with wildcards to capture

133

keyword variations: Emotiv, EPOC, electroencephalograph, EEG, event-related,

134

ERP. For example, in PsychINFO we used: (Emotiv OR EPOC) AND

135

(electroenceph* OR EEG OR event-related OR event related OR ERP). The initial

136

search was conducted in June of 2018. A second search was conducted in February

137

of 2019 and a third search was conducted in February 2020.

Fig 1 outlines the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and

139

Meta-analyses (PRISMA) flowchart for this review (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, &

140

Altman, 2009). In brief, we identified 724 articles via the database search. This

141

included 249 duplicate articles resulting in 475 articles after removal.

Stage 3: Study Selection

145

We excluded twenty-two records for which the full-text could not be retrieved

146

and screened the remaining articles according to the following eligibility criteria: (1)

147

EPOC device used; (2) Actual data collected; (3) Articles published in peer-reviewed

148

journals or conference proceedings. We removed seventy-one studies that failed at

149

least one of these criteria. These included publications in which EPOC appeared as

150

the acronym for Effective Practice and Organisation of Care, in which no actual EEG

151

data was collected, which were not written in English, or were literature reviews.

152

The final number of studies included in this review was 382. Of these, 252

153

were conference proceedings and 130 were journal articles. As the conference

154

proceedings in this review meet the criteria of peer review, we did not distinguish

155

between conference proceedings and journal articles. However, Fig 2 provides a

156

breakdown of the types of studies over the years included in this review.

159

Stage 4: Charting the data
We charted the data by recording relevant information from each record. This

160

information included the author(s), year of publication, study location, and aims of

161

the study. We classified each study according to its aim into one of five categories:

162

(1) EPOC used as a BCI device (e.g., control of a wheel chair); (2) EPOC used as a

163

clinical tool (e.g., to assess depression); (3) EPOC used to collect EEG data for

164

developing or refining EEG signal processing techniques (e.g., to reduce artefacts in

165

EEG data streams); (4) EPOC used as a theory development tool (e.g., to examine

EEG device (e.g., comparing EPOC to research-grade EEG systems). See Table 1

To chart the location of EPOC studies, we used the first authors’

corresponding address. To visualise the global distribution of EPOC studies, we

173

obtained latitude and longitude coordinates from a world cities database

174

(https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities). If cities did not have coordinate

175

information in the database, we performed a Google search and entered the

176

coordinates manually. See supporting information (S2 Appendix) for data extracted

179

Stage 5: Collating, Summarising, and Reporting the Results
The first three EPOC-related studies were published in the year after its

180

release, 2010. These initial studies were all related to BCI: two P300 classification

181

studies [2, 4] and a robotic arm control study [3]. A year later, 2011, saw the first

182

study published using EPOC for experimental research [5]. This study examined the

183

relationship between EEG, personality, and mood on perceived engagement. The

184

first publications aimed at validating EPOC appeared in 2013 [6-8, 29, 30].

185

Overall, the number of EPOC studies showed a steady increase from 2010 (n

186

= 3) to 2015 (n = 61), after which the numbers fell to 58, 59 and 44 in 2016, 2017,

187

and 2018 respectively, and then increased to 52 publications in 2019 (see Fig 3).

188

While the true reason for this pattern is unknown, it may well reflect a change in the

189

licensing of Emotiv software, which switched to a subscription-based license in 2016

190

(previously the license involved a one-time fee). This increased the cost of the EPOC

191

for research, which may explain the declining in publications in 2015 – 2018. The

192

resurgence in 2019 could be acceptance of the licensing fee as the new standard

193

and being factored into budgets and grant applications. It remains to be seen how

194

this fee structure will impact EPOC use in the future.

Location

197

In the years 2009 to 2019, the five countries that published the most EPOC

198

studies were the United States (n = 35), India (n = 25), China (n = 20), Poland (n =

199

17), and Pakistan (n = 17). The five individual cities that published the most EPOC

200

studies were Islamabad (n = 11), Singapore (n = 10), Bandung, Indonesia (n = 7),

201

Cairo (n = 7), and Sydney (n = 7). See Fig 4 for overall global distribution of studies

Applications

205

BCI. BCI applications represented the majority of EPOC studies

206

(approximately 73% of studies in this review). To better characterise BCI studies, we

207

further classified them into four subcategories: (a) biometrics, (b) device control, and

208

(c) state recognition, and (c) general classification. See Table 2 for description of

209

each subcategory.

BCI biometrics. Much like a fingerprint or a password, individual brain

signatures can identify individuals, granting them access to systems or facilities. As

214

the variation between individuals’ brain waves can be quite complex, the use of

215

individual EEG signatures as a biometric indicator represents a promising application

216

of portable EEG technology. A total of 11 studies used EPOC to investigate EEG in

217

the context of user-authentication and security. The earliest biometric EPOC study

218

was published in 2013 and used a P300 speller paradigm to investigate the

219

feasibility of using EEG classification for user authentication [31]. Recently, study

220

designs and classification methods have grown more sophisticated. For example,

221

Moctezuma, Torres-Garcia (32) used feature extraction and classification to

222

distinguish between individuals’ EEG signatures while they imagined speaking

223

words. Likewise, Seha and Hatzinakos (33) also employed feature extraction, in this

224

case on auditory evoked potentials, to accurately (> 95%) discriminate between

225

individuals. Compared to BCI studies in general, relatively few EPOC studies have

226

focused on biometry. Nevertheless, there has been a general increase in biometric

227

studies since 2013 and this field represents one of the many practical applications of

228

portable EEG technology.

229

BCI device control. The control of external devices, such as prostheses or

230

wheelchairs, is the most straightforward application of EEG-based BCIs. A total of 97

231

studies, representing 35% of BCI studies and 25% of studies overall, used EPOC as

232

a means of controlling or interacting with machines in users’ environment. P300

233

spellers are perhaps the most well-known type of BCI interface that fall under this

234

category. P300 speller interfaces exploit the well-documented and robust signature

235

observed as deflection in an ERP waveform in a response to a target stimulus. By

236

capitalising on the P300, a computer can detect when a target letter flashes on a

237

screen thereby allowing selection of letters without physical interaction. Though there

238

were several EPOC studies in this review that investigated traditional P300 speller

239

BCI interfaces [34-37], others harnessed P300 for such purposes as interacting with

240

navigation systems [38] and robotic devices [39]. Suhas, Dhal (40) investigated

241

using ERPs to control a light bulb and a fan, with an eye towards giving physically

242

disabled individuals control of ‘smart’ appliances. Other studies have employed

243

EPOC as a means of controlling robots [41-47], tractors [48], and drones [49].

244

Practical and effective BCI device control using EEG has the potential to benefit a

245

large population, such as individuals who have lost the use of motor functions. For

246

this reason, this area of research has received much attention and it should be

247

expected to continue to do so.

248

BCI state recognition. Characterising and identifying cognitive or affective

249

states using EEG is critical for many BCI paradigms and is a hallmark of

250

neurofeedback applications. Many researchers have used EPOC to achieve this. For

251

example, an early EPOC study attempted to recognise EEG patterns when

252

participants imagined pictures [50]. More recent studies have used sophisticated

253

algorithms to identify cognitive states, such as confusion [51], fatigue [52] and

254

emotions [53-55]. Identifying an individual’s mental state can help to improve human

255

performance in demanding situations. For example, Binias, Myszor (56) used an

256

EPOC to develop algorithms aimed at helping pilots respond more quickly to

257

unanticipated events. Studies like these demonstrate that the rapid and accurate

258

identification of cognitive and affective states, even before conscious recognition,

259

may lead to safer roads and skies.

260

BCI general classification. A total of 75 BCI studies were not readily

261

classifiable in the above subcategories as they were not concerned with a direct

262

application of research. Rather, these studies aimed to increase the usability of BCI

263

technology through the development and refinement of EEG classification

264

algorithms. For example, Perez-Vidal, Garcia-Beltran (57) collected EEG data with

13

265

EPOC in order to determine the effectiveness of a machine-learning algorithm for

266

correctly identifying P300 evoked potentials. In this example, direct use of the P300

267

was not directly used for interfacing with a specific device/machine. Rather, the

268

central focus was on the algorithm itself. We categorised these types of studies as

269

general classification studies.

270

Clinical. The small form factor and ease of setup make portable EEG devices

271

ideal for use in clinical settings in which the objective is to treat or diagnosis health

272

conditions. Eleven studies in this review used EPOC for this purpose, with six

273

studies aimed at using EPOC specifically for a therapeutic purpose. For example,

274

studies have used EPOC to provide neurofeedback for motor rehabilitation [58, 59]

275

or for the treatment of depression [60] and pain [61, 62]. Five studies used EPOC as

276

a diagnostic tool with the aims of assessing conditions such as depression [63],

277

attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [64, 65], or encephalopathy [66]. Yet another

278

study used EPOC to monitor changes in the nervous system of a group of Turkish

279

researchers who visited Antarctica [67].

280

Signal processing. Twelve studies in this review aimed to improve EEG

281

signal processing techniques used with EPOC data. For example, Sinha, Chatterjee

282

(68), Soumya, Zia Ur Rahman (69), and Jun Hou, Mustafa (70) used EPOC to test

283

techniques aimed at reducing EEG artefacts and noise. Additionally, Moran and

284

Soriano (71) compared different techniques for maximising EPOC EEG signal quality

285

while Petrov, Stamenova (72) and Shahzadi, Anwar (73) investigated remote EEG

286

transmission and processing. These studies are important as the signal-to-noise

287

ratio of EEG can be small and techniques aimed at increasing it can broaden the

288

utility of EEG devices. In addition, the increasingly distanced nature of research and

289

clinical diagnostics necessitates the development of effective data transmission

290

pipelines.

291

Experimental Research. We identified a total of 51 experimental research

292

studies that used EPOC incidentally to answer questions related to brain function.

293

That is, researchers could have used any EEG device to collect data but they chose

294

EPOC. Most of these studies were directly concerned with investigating EEG

295

signatures related to certain processes, situations, or tasks. Many were cognitive in

296

nature including EEG signatures related to cognitive load [74-77], alertness [78],

297

distraction [79], learning styles [76], semantic association [80-82], and memory [83].

298

Other studies examined EEG signatures related to perception. These included

299

spatial perception [84], taste perception [85], olfactory perception [86], and visual

300

perception [87, 88].

301

Studies examining social phenomena also constituted a large proportion of

302

EPOC research projects. For example, we found studies in which EPOC was used to

303

investigate consumer behaviour and preference [89-92]. Other socially-oriented

304

studies examined the EEQ patterns associated with conformity [93], deception [94],

305

perception of quality, [95], and motivation and interest in an educational environment

306

[96].

307

Researchers also used EPOC to better understand ailments or disorders.

308

These types of studies are contrasted with those in the clinical category where

309

publications were aimed at treating ailments or disorders, rather than investigating

310

the ailments or disorders. For example, Askari, Setarehdan (97), Askari, Setarehdan

311

(98) used the device to investigate neural connectivity in autism. Similarly, Fan,

312

Wade (99) used EPOC to collect EEG data with the aim of building models to

313

accurately identify cognitive and affective states in autistic individuals while driving.

314

In addition to autism, other studies examined the EEG signatures associated with

315

bipolar disorder [100] and mild cognitive impairment [101].

316

Many research studies were more action-oriented. These types of studies

317

used EPOC to characterise the EEG signatures associated with video games [102,

318

103], driving [104-106], moving through urban [107] or virtual [108] environments,

319

and performance of specialised tasks [109, 110].

320

Validation. Assessing the validity of a device is an important step in

321

establishing its widespread implementation. If an EEG system cannot be

322

demonstrated to accurately capture the data it purports to, then any conclusions

323

drawn from this data are questionable. We identified thirty-one studies that tested the

324

validity of EPOC as a research-grade EEG device. The first EPOC validation studies

325

appeared in 2013. In this year there were five studies assessing the capabilities of

326

EPOC. These studies assessed the accuracy of P300 identification [6], the validity of

327

affect signatures [7], and whether EPOC could be used to collect valid ERPs [8, 29,

328

30]. Another five EPOC validation studies were published in 2014 before peaking in

329

2015 (n = 7) and then declining in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 (n = 4, n = 4, n = 3,

330

and n = 3, respectively).

331

Studies varied in both approach and intended application of the validation.

332

Some did not use a benchmark device with which to compare EPOC. For example,

333

Rodriguez Ortega, Rey Solaz (111) compared EPOC-captured affect signatures to

334

those demonstrated in the literature. Another simply aimed to determine the

335

classification accuracy of EPOC in P300 tasks [112]. However, most studies

336

compared the EPOC to the performance of other research- or consumer-grade EEG

337

devices. Four validation studies compared auditory ERPs between systems [8, 10,

338

113]. Three studies compared visual ERPs between systems [9, 114 McDowell, &

16

339

Hairston, 2014, 115, 116]. Tello, Müller (117) also conducted a visual-related

340

validation study in which they compared EEG device performance on steady-state

341

visual evoked potential (SSVEP) tasks, while Szalowski and Picovici (118) tested the

342

capacity of EPOC to distinguish between different SSVEP experimental parameters.

343

Melnik, Legkov (119) compared the performance of multiple systems on both visual

344

ERPs and SSVEPs. Also in the visual domain, Kotowski, Stapor (120) examined the

345

capacity of EPOC to collect ERPs of emotional face processing. Takehara,

346

Kayanuma (121) compared the performance of EPOC to another device on capacity

347

to capture event-related desynchronization while Grummett, Leibbrandt (122)

348

conducted a comprehensive validation study that compared EPOC to other devices

349

on power spectra, ERPs, SSVEPs, and event-related

350

desynchronization/synchronisation.

351

Some studies validated EPOC’s capacity to measure cognitive indicators with

352

one study comparing devices’ capture of cognitive load signatures [123 Sinharay, &

353

Sinha, 2014], and another comparing the performance of systems during cognitive

354

tasks using time and frequency analyses [124]. Likewise, Naas, Rodrigues (125)

355

tested whether EPOC could enhance cognitive performance in neurofeedback tasks.

356

Three studies validated EPOC for BCI use by comparing its performance to

357

other device performance on P300 speller tasks [6, 126, 127]. Two others compared

358

the performance of devices on motor imagery tasks [128, 129]. Finally, Maskeliunas,

359

Damasevicius (130) compared the capacity of devices to recognise mental states.

360

Since 2013, many studies have sought to determine the validity of EPOC.

361

While assessment of the conclusions of these studies are outside the aims of this

362

scoping review, what can be noted is that quantity of studies demonstrates

363

researchers’ interest in employing these devices in their work.

Limitations

364
365

This scoping review has some limitations. With nearly 400 records selected,

366

the charting phase represented an enormous undertaking. Although the review

367

employed a systematic methodology using PRISMA guidelines and searching a

368

broad array of databases, it was impossible to include every study that used EPOC.

369

We deliberately omitted common systematic search strategies, such as grey-

370

literature searching, hand searching, and backward citation searching. We did this as

371

inclusion of these strategies would not have added enough value to justify the

372

additional time and resources. We believe this scoping review represents a quality

373

characterisation of EPOC research and satisfies the stated aims of the project. In

374

addition, like all scientific reviews, its success depends on the search terms. If a

375

publication did not contain ‘Emotiv’ or ‘EPOC’ in the title, abstract, or keywords, then

376

it did not appear in our search. We could have overcome this limitation by

377

broadening our search terms. However, we again believe our search constraints

378

produced an accurate characterisation of the EPOC literature, without creating an

379

unwieldy scoping dataset.

380
381
382

Conclusion
In this scoping review, we aimed to chart the location and purpose of EPOC-

383

related research. In doing so, we have outlined the many studies that have used

384

Emotiv EPOC as an EEG acquisition device. From BCI applications to experimental

385

research studies to clinical environments, the last 10 years has seen diverse

386

implementation of EPOC. Global use and a low financial barrier likely facilitate

387

research in areas of limited resources. Considering the cost of a research-grade

388

EEG system, it is not hard to imagine scientists and engineers in developing nations

389

embracing EPOC as an ideal device with which to conduct neuroscience research.

390

In addition, this device (and devices like it) may enable collection of data that would

391

be impossible with traditional EEG devices. For example, Parameshwaran and

392

Thiagarajan (131) used an EPOC in both rural and urban settings in India to

393

demonstrate differences in EEG signatures related to factors such as socioeconomic

394

status, exposure to technology, and travel experience.

395

We expect that this review will provide a useful reference for researchers who

396

may be looking for cost-effective, portable EEG solutions. We hope it may also serve

397

as an inspiration for those considering incorporating portable EEG devices into their

398

research and facilitate the conceptualisation and development of future experiments

399

and applications.
