Technical advances, particularly the integration of wearable and embedded sensors,
facilitate tracking of physiological responses in a less intrusive way. Currently, there are
many devices that allow gathering biometric measurements from human beings, such
as EEG Headsets or Health Bracelets. The massive data sets generated by tracking
of EEG and physiology may be used, among other things, to infer knowledge about
human moods and emotions. Apart from direct biometric signal measurement, eye
tracking systems are nowadays capable of determining the point of gaze of the users
when interacting in ICT environments, which provides an added value research on many
different areas, such as psychology or marketing. We present a process in which devices
for eye tracking, biometric, and EEG signal measurements are synchronously used for
studying both basic and complex emotions. We selected the least intrusive devices
for different signal data collection given the study requirements and cost constraints,
so users would behave in the most natural way possible. On the one hand, we have
been able to determine basic emotions participants were experiencing by means of
valence and arousal. On the other hand, a complex emotion such as empathy has
also been detected. To validate the usefulness of this approach, a study involving
forty-four people has been carried out, where they were exposed to a series of affective
stimuli while their EEG activity, biometric signals, and eye position were synchronously
recorded to detect self-regulation. The hypothesis of the work was that people who
self-regulated would show significantly different results when analyzing their EEG data.
Participants were divided into two groups depending on whether Electro Dermal Activity
(EDA) data indicated they self-regulated or not. The comparison of the results obtained
using different machine learning algorithms for emotion recognition shows that using
EEG activity alone as a predictor for self-regulation does not allow properly determining
whether a person in self-regulation its emotions while watching affective stimuli. However,
adequately combining different data sources in a synchronous way to detect emotions
makes it possible to overcome the limitations of single detection methods.

Improving EEG Based Emotion Recognition

INTRODUCTION

measure biometric data such as temperature, pulse or skin
conductance.
Regarding other interesting biometric signals usable for
emotion detection, ElectroDermal Activity (EDA) is the property
of the human body that causes continuous variation in the
electrical characteristics of the skin. These changes in the
electrical properties of the skin are caused by an interaction
between environmental events and the psychological state of the
individual. Human skin is a good conductor of electricity and
when a weak electrical current is induced on the skin, changes
in the skin conductivity can be measured. Öhman et al. (1993)
discussed the role of autonomic activity in emotion, focusing
on EDA as a reliable estimator. On the other hand, Appelhans
and Luecken (2006) provided a review of the theoretical and
empirical rationale for the use of Heart Rate Variation as an index
of individual differences in regulated emotional responding.
Another interesting source of biometric measure about
emotion is human vision, which transmits the images it receives
via the eye, retina, and second cranial nerve (optic nerve) into the
brain passing the chiasm, thalamus, and visual cortex. Moreover,
it tries to control both eyes, directing them to the most relevant
position at that point in time. This task is performed by the
oculomotor system that controls the six muscles attached to
each eye via the third cranial nerves. Eye tracking provides
human vision feedback. The data collected by the eye tracker
captures the moment when the image is shown followed by
the response of the oculomotor system, including response time
and exact saccade characteristics. Data regarding blink frequency
and pupil size, which can indicate cognitive load changes, can
also be accessed by these means. Besides, the most desired
type of eye tracking output is the estimation of the Point Of
Regard (POR) of the viewer, that is, where he/she is looking. By
detecting eye position, gaze direction, sequence of eye movement
and visual adaptation during cognitive activities, eye tracking is
an effective tool for experimental psychology and neurological
research, as it can allows establishing which aspects of EEG or
biometric signals may be related to human vision (Popa et al.,
2015).
In fact, vision becomes a clue for understanding emotions
and becomes a first step to understand what is happening
emotionally. We must consider that physical activity not
detectable by EEG alone has influence on the brain activity.
Unintentional body movements have their influence in the EEG.
Eye movements introduce large artifacts to EEG and thus render
data analysis difficult or even impossible. Trials contaminated by
eye movement and blink artifacts have to be discarded, hence in
standard EEG-paradigms subjects are required to fixate on the
screen. Plöchl et al. (2012) aims at a better understanding of
individual eye movement artifacts, their interrelations and the
respective implications for eye artifact correction. Apart from
eye tracking, other biometric signals such as blood variations
and heart rate have also been used to more appropriately
interpret brain signals. For instance, De Pascalis et al. (1998)
recorded EEG and heart rate during self-generated happy and
sad emotions using a relaxation condition as a control after the
administration of a standard hypnotic induction. Such biometric
signals have to be considered in order to isolate and later

Emotion is a subjective experience characterized by psychophysiological expressions, biological reactions, and mental states.
From a psychological point of view, an emotion is a complex
psychological state that involves three distinct components: a
subjective experience, a physiological response, and a behavioral
or expressive response (Hockenbury and Hockenbury, 2007).
Ekman (1999) as part of his valuable legacy, established the
foundations for measuring emotions. During his research,
he discovered that basic emotions exist and are culturally
independent. These basic emotions can be read literally from
people’s facial expressions. Mehrabian and Russell (1974)
proposed that environmental stimuli are linked to behavioral
responses by the primary emotional responses of arousal,
pleasure, and dominance. Russell and Pratt (1980) presented his
two-dimensional model of affect, including pleasure-displeasure
and arousal-sleep as the two dimensions. The model itself is
based on the internal representation of affect of the people
tested, i.e., their cognitive structure of the interpretation of
emotions and not a description of their current affective state.
The result is a universal and easily transferable metric for
describing emotions. Dimension-based approaches are widely
used in affective computing for measuring emotions (Calvo and
D’Mello, 2010). According to Picard (1997), most theories about
emotions can be divided in two main groups. The first group
states that emotions are cognitive, emphasizing their mental
component, while the second group states that emotions are
physical, thus emphasizing their corporal component. However,
some emotions are not entirely corporal or have a pure
emotional component, they may also have a strictly cognitive
part associated. An example is empathy, in which two different
emotional and cognitive facets can be determined (Davis et al.,
1987).
Regarding systems that can help studying the affective
processes in the human brain, EEG, PET scans, or fMRI stand
out. EEG can detect changes in brain activity over milliseconds,
which is excellent considering an action potential takes
∼0.5–130 ms to propagate across a single neuron, depending
on the type of neuron. Nevertheless, EEG measures the brain’s
electrical activity directly, while fMRI and PET record changes
in blood flow or metabolic activity, which are indirect markers
of brain electrical activity. EEG can be considered as the most
studied potentially non-invasive brain activity detector system in
computational emotional systems, mainly due to its fine temporal
resolution, ease of use or portability, been not as invasive as
the other alternatives and relatively low cost. However, EEG
alone does not record indirect brain electrical activity markers,
such as changes in blood flow or metabolic activity. Therefore,
combining EEG with other non-invasive biometric information
detection systems is a promising way to improve emotion
detection.
Devices for biometric measurement are nowadays widely
available. Data from wearable sensors can be used for passive
tracking of physiological responses (Morris and Aguilera, 2012).
The range of available devices is very large, including wristbands,
accelerometers, posture sensors, or cameras, which serve to

discard their associated brain activity from the emotion analysis.
In order to differentiate the neural substrates of vagal tone
due to emotion, Lane et al. (2009) correlated HF-HRV with
measures of regional cerebral blood flow derived from PET and
15 O-water in 12 healthy women during different emotional
states.
Self-regulation with different bio signals viewing affective
imagery was analyzed by Davidson and Schwartz (1976), who
performed an experiment to obtain information on central
mechanisms underlying cardiac self-regulation by comparing
changes in cerebral asymmetry during self-control of heart
rate with changes observed during the production of affective
imagery. Heart rate showed significant effects between up vs.
down, and between anger vs. relaxing imagery in the image
phase. The EEG data indicated similar patterns of hemispheric
asymmetry.
We have performed a study to determine the validity of
proposed process in which it is aimed to determine whether
EEG activity alone is a good indicator of self-regulation when
viewing affective images. A group of forty-four people had to
watch a series of affective stimuli while their EEG activity,
biometric signals, and eye position were synchronously recorded.
The EDA data were processed according to existing literature
to determine which people self-regulated their biometric activity
while watching affective stimuli. Participants were divided into
two groups, the ones that self-regulated and the ones that did not
according to EDA.
The hypothesis of the work was that people who self-regulated
would show significantly different results when analyzing their
EEG data. In order to prove it, different machine learning
algorithms for emotion recognition were used for both groups
and their results compared.
Our results show that using EEG activity alone as a
predictor for self-regulation does not allow properly determining
whether a person in self-regulation its emotions while watching
affective stimuli. This fact shows that adequately combining
different data sources in a synchronous way to detect emotions
allows overcoming possible deficits when using single detection
methods. The use of un-invasive devices for different signal
detection will be favored in order to maintain user interaction
as natural as possible.
To validate this hypothesis and provide information about
how the process performs, the next sections present the
study in which eye tracking, biometric, and EEG signals have
been combined for determining basic and complex emotions.
Gathered information has been used to detect different emotions
the participants experienced while watching a predefined set of
stimuli.

Participants
Forty-four participants (6 males and 38 females, aged between 20
and 30 years with a mean of 22 years) participated in the study.
The participants were undergraduate students of the University
de Lleida. Individuals with a prior history of neurological or
psychiatric illness were excluded.

Emotion-Eliciting Images and Videos
Thirty-one images were retrieved from the International
Affective Picture System (IAPS) (Lang et al., 1999) to elicit
positive (Eleven pleasant images), negative (Thirteen unpleasant
images) or neutral (7 neutral images) emotions. Images were
presented at intervals of 5 s and neutral images were placed
after the images producing the higher values of valence to
test if participants did return to a neutral state or they just
reduced their excitement slightly. IAPS is a database of images
designed to provide a standardized set of pictures for studying
emotion and attention widely used in psychology, and emotion
research (Horlings et al., 2008; Petersen et al., 2011). Each
picture is accompanied by a detailed list of average ratings of
the emotions elicited, accounted for by valence, arousal, and
dominance dimensions. Apart from the images, four video clips
of 15 s each were also showed to the participants, illustrating
positive and negative emotions. These videos were taken from
Mind Reading Full Version 1.2 software and were displayed after
the images. To avoid order effects on emotion elicitation, the
presentation of the 31 images was counterbalanced using a Latin
square design.

EEG, Biometric Signal, and Eye Tracking
Measurement
EEG was recorded using Emotiv EPOC EEG. It has a headset with
sensor to capture 14 EEG channels plus 2 references. Channel
names based on the international 10–20 electrode location system
are: AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8,
AF4, with CMS/DRL references in the P3/P4 locations. Emotiv
EPOC/EPOC + uses sequential sampling method, single ADC,
at a rate of 128 SPS or 256 SPS (2048 Hz internal). Emotiv EPOC
operates at a resolution of 14 bits or 16 bit per channel with
frequency response between 0.16 and 43 Hz.
The technology used in the experiment also included an
Empatica Wristband. This bracelet has sensors to capture
different biometric signals at the same time, specifically EDA,
Blood Volume Pulse (BVP), Acceleration, Heart Rate, and
Temperature.
Tobii T60 Eye Tracker was used for eye tracking, which has
infrared diodes to generate reflection patterns on the corneas
of the user’s eyes. These reflection patterns, together with other
visual information about the person, are collected by image
sensors and enable calculating the POR in real time. Figure 1
shows a participant wearing EEG and biometric signal capture
devices while using the eye tracker.
The eye tracker is based on the pupil center corneal
reflection (PCCR) technique (Duchowski, 2007). The user eye

Experimental Protocol

is illuminated with near-infrared light and the reflections are
captured by the two eye tracker cameras. Both images are then
processed to identify the reflection of the light source on the
cornea (glint) and in the pupil. This information is used to
calculate the vector formed by the angle between the cornea
and pupil reflections, which allow computing gaze direction
and point relative to the image shown to the user in the eye
tracker monitor. This stream of data is processed by Tobii Studio
software to compute gaze plots, which show the location, order,
and time spent looking at locations on the stimulus. It is also
possible to use Tobii Studio to generate heat-maps that show
how looking is distributed over the stimulus. Both gaze plots and
heat-maps are then used in data pre-processing, as described in
Subsection Data Pre-processing.

The test was carried out in a usability laboratory located at the
Universitat de Lleida. Before the execution of the tasks defined
in the protocol, the facilitator provided the participants with
the pre-test questionnaire they had filled in, in which their
demographics and their suitability for the study were established.
If the participant was suitable for the study, the experimental
procedure started after all devices were checked and calibrated
in order to synchronize them and data collection began. The
facilitator explained the procedure to the participants and helped
them to wear the devices and check that they were well placed
and working correctly. The facilitator drove the experimental
protocol and assisted them during the requested tasks. The
facilitator also took care that anybody or anything disturbed the
experiment. The requested tasks were basically to observe the
set of 31 IAPS pictures and 4 videos from the MindReading
corpus. Each image was shown to each user for 5 s. To avoid order
effects on emotion elicitation, which could negatively bias the
execution of the tasks, the presentation of the thirty-one images
was counterbalanced using a Latin square design. When the
participants finished all tasks, which took about 15 min overall,
the facilitator asked them some post-test questions and briefly
interviewed them to detect issues experienced by the participants
during the test.

Hypothesis
The main hypothesis of this work is summarized next:
H1–Self-regulation affects emotions recognition in EEG
signals.
People whose self-regulated during the session was
determined by means of EDA would show significantly
different results when analyzing their EEG data with different
machine learning algorithms for emotion recognition.

Data Managing

Then, EDA is also included in the analysis. In this case
all Empatica Wristband data is time stamped and thus
synchronization is eased. This additional information will be
considered later during data analysis based on the fact that
changes in EDA occur as a result of activation of regions deep
in the brain. This is sustained by previous work showing that
when the amygdala or hippocampus get activated, they elicit
skin conductance on the same side of the body (Mangina and
Beuzeron-Mangina, 1996).
For instance, stimulating four brain regions on the left
or four on the right (with depth electrodes) produces large
skin conductance on the same side. Finally, we obtain valence
from EEG data analysis and arousal values from EDA analysis.
High/low arousal values are candidates to choose the same
temporal EEG values.

All used devices were synchronized and used jointly during the
experiments. Regarding data analysis, the following phases have
been performed.

Data Pre-processing
Input from different devices is combined to help filtering out
undesired signals. First, heat-maps and gaze plots are obtained
using the eye tracker and pre-processed. The eye tracker helps
deciding which part of the combined set of signals produced by
the different sensors used in the experiment is relevant. It shows
what the user is visualizing and helps correlating this with the
measures of the bracelet and the headset, thus making it possible
to relate what the user is looking at and what his/her feelings are.
Moreover, this way it is easier to disregard undesirable effects in
the EEG, such as blinking or head or muscle movements, as they
are recorded by the Eye Tracker.
Another combined signal is the accelerometer, which helps
discarding non-relevant signals coming from voluntary or
involuntary user movements. These undesirable signals can be
removed when detected using software filters. These filter have
been implemented with EEGLab, an interactive Matlab toolbox
for processing continuous and event-related EEG. In order to
analyze EEG data, several filters have been applied using Matlab
and EEGLab, specifically a passband filter (0.1–50 Hz), and a
notch filter (50 Hz) to avoid parasite power signal.
Besides, Independent Component Analysis (ICA; Karhunen
et al., 1997) was performed on filtered data removing artifacts,
such as eye blinks, which were detected by eye tracking, from
EEG data. ICA was run once, then bad epochs were rejected,
ICA was ran another time on pruned data and the resulting
ICA weights were applied to the same dataset. The disadvantage
of ICA is that the components do not necessarily only contain
artifact data, they might also contain underlying EEG data. Thus,
removing the contaminated component will lead to the loss
of EEG data. Consequenty, more sophisticated approaches that
improve the ICA algorithm have been explored (Plöchl et al.,
2012; Mannan et al., 2016). Particularly, methods that combine
the ICA algorithm and wavelets (Burger and van den Heever,
2015), which seems to be a promising approach.

Data Analysis
After data processing, all the signals to be considered during
the analysis are already filtered and synchronized. Data is then
combined by organizing it on the basis of the provided stimuli,
i.e., the IAPS images. For each stimulus, all the EEG and EDA
measures in the corresponding time range are processed to
compute valence and arousal.
EEG is used to compute the valence based on frontal
asymmetry, as previously introduced and detailed in Section Data
Analysis Remarks. On the other hand, EDA is directly used as a
measure of the arousal. The valence and arousal values combined
define a point in the Pleasure Arousal and Dominance (PAD)
2D space (Mehrabian and Russell, 1974). This point corresponds
to the emotion, which is then correlated with the valence and
arousal values reported in IAPS for each of its images.

Data Analysis Remarks
Some preliminary analysis has been performed over empathy
complex emotion. It has been found significantly higher P300
amplitudes on parietal electrodes (Kleih and Kübler, 2013)
in participants with a low ability for perspective taking and
therefore, lower empathy, as compared to participants with
higher empathy. As empathy can be divided in cognitive and
emotional facets (Davis et al., 1987) and P300 belongs to
its cognitive facet, the analysis is performed strictly over the
emotional facet. Empathic Gaze pattern was examined where
expressions of sadness and anger attracted more gaze dwelltime to the eye-region than other emotional expressions (Cowan,
2015). Calvo and Lang (2004) began to work in gaze patterns
when looking at emotional pictures and there has been intensive
work in measuring emotions with eye tracking (Raudonis et al.,
2013). These works have been taken into account when analyzing
gathered data.
Following Tóth (2015), it is possible to establish positive vs.
negative emotions using EEG analysis, as positive emotions such
as joy, amusement or excitement are mostly processes in the left
hemisphere of the brain, while negative ones, such as disgust, fear,
sadness are handled in the amygdala and the right hemisphere,
which gives rise to the phenomena of frontal alpha asymmetry.
Self-referential emotions such as pride, shame or guilt can also
be found, as they operate in the frontal lobe and arise when our

Data Processing
The segments of EEG data selected during pre-processing (called
Epochs) are processed using eye tracker guidance, based on
heat-maps and gaze plots. EEG data lacks time stamps, so
synchronization with Eye Tracker data, which is time stamped,
is attained using a loud sound. The sound is recorded together
with Eye Tracker audio and appears in the EEG signal due to the
user response to the sound.
Combining EEG and Eye Tracker data allows knowing the
time expended at different parts of the user interface (in our case
the pictures from the IAPS set shown to user), and even the order
they have been visualized. As during pre-processing, this analysis
is also performed using EEGLab, so it is possible to filter the EEG
Epochs that correspond to the time periods while the user was
looking at a particular IAPS picture or even an area of it.

5. k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): This algorithm is a case-based,
nearest-neighbor classifier (Aha et al., 1991). To classify a new
test sample, a simple distance measure is used to find the
training instance closest to the given test instance, and then,
it predicts the same class as this nearest training instance.
6. Naive Bayes (NB): The naive Bayes rule uses the Bayes
theorem to predict the class for each case, assuming that the
predictive genes are independent given the category (Cestnik,
1990).
7. Logistic Regression (LR): A logistic regression is considered as
a regression model where the dependent variable is categorical
(Freedman, 2009).
8. C4.5: It represents a classification model by a decision tree
(Quinlan, 1993). The tree is constructed in a top-down way,
dividing the training set and beginning with the selection of
the best variable in the root of the tree.
9. Radial Basis Function (RBF) network: A radial basis function
network is an artificial neural network using radial basis
functions as activation functions (Broomhead and Lowe,
1988). The output of the network is a linear combination of
radial basis functions of the input neuron parameters.
10. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP): A multilayer perceptron is a
feedforward artificial neural network model to map sets of
input data onto a set of appropriate outputs (Rosenblatt,
1961). An MLP consists of multiple layers of nodes in a
directed graph, with each layer fully connected to the next one.
Except for the input nodes, each node is a processing element
with a nonlinear activation function.

behavior is compared to social norms. Arousal is measured from
skin conductivity, which is driven by the sympathetic branch of
the autonomic nervous system and is used to capture the affective
state. Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) can be divided into two
main features: Skin Conductance Level (SCL), the tonic part,
provides a measure of arousal while Skin Conductance Response
(SCR), the phasic part, reflects instant changes in arousal. SCR
present quick changes in excitement, and corresponds to fast
changes in sympathetic arousal, and represent general vigilance.
Table 1 is used for describing the relationships between different
emotions and their biometric correlates.

Machine Learning Experiments
Derived from the gathered EDA data, the participants were
divided into two groups, one group in which participants selfregulated when watching the affective stimuli and another group
for the users that did not self-regulate. From the forty-four
participants, the data of one of them was discarded, as it was not
synchronized appropriately due to a hardware malfunction. Out
of the other 43, EDA activity showed that 21 self-regulated and
were assigned to group one, while the other 22 were assigned to
group number two.
The experiments were carried out using 10 well-known
machine-learning supervised classification algorithms through
the Weka software package (Hall et al., 2009), which includes a
collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks.
A brief description of the classifiers is presented below.

Selected hyperparameters and configuration options for each
classifier were: C 1.0 and Polykernel with a 1.0 value for its
exponent (SVM); 1.0E-8 for ridge estimator (L), unlimited tree
depth and 100 iterations to be performed (RF); 3.0 as the
minimum total weight of instances in a rule and 3 optimization
runs and 10-folds for pruning (RIPPER); 1000 neighbors and
linear nearest neighbor search (KNN); crossvalidated with
heuristic for greedy stopping and 500 maximum iterations for
logicboost (LR); 0.1 as confidence factor for pruning and at least
15 instances per leaf (C4.5); 2 clusters and 0.01 as minimum
standard deviation for the clusters (RBF); and 1000 epochs to
train through, (attribute + instance)/2 hidden layers on the
neural network, 0.4 learning rate and 0.3 momentum (MLP).
In all of the experiments, 10-fold cross-validation (Stone,
1974) was applied to get validated classification accuracy (wellclassified rate), which is the main measure that has been used
in this study to evaluate classification methods. The accuracy
reflects how many times the emotions are recognized. In this case,
three categories of emotions were defined: pleasant, unpleasant,
or neutral, according to the IAPS images that participants viewed.
Accuracy is expressed as a percentage with respect to the total of
the recordings.

1. Support Vector Machines (SVM): Set of related supervised
learning methods used for classification and regression
(Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). Viewing input data as two sets
of vectors in a n-dimensional space, an SVM will construct
a separating hyperplane in that space, one that maximizes the
margin between the two datasets.
2. Logistic (L): Class for building and using a multinomial
logistic regression model with a ridge estimator (Le Cessie and
van Houwelingen, 1992).
3. Random Forest (RF): Constructs a combination of many
unpruned decision trees (Breiman, 2001). The output class is
the mode of the classes output by individual trees.
4. Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction
(RIPPER): Rule-based learner presented in Cohen (2005) that
forms rules through a process of repeated growing (to fit
training data) and pruning (to avoid overfitting). RIPPER
handles multiple classes by ordering them from least to most
prevalent and then treating each in order as a distinct twoclass problem.

positively to the percentage of gaze time in the eyes area. This
approach was validated by Wang et al. (2006), who used this
technique with empathic tutoring software agents, as a way to
measure empathy without getting deeper into distinguishing
between cognitive and affective empathy. This part of the analysis
was performed over the videos alone.
Using the data collected by the eye tracker, Figures 5–7 show
a comparative between time fixations on eyes and mouth. In both
males and females, the percentage of gaze eye time fixation is
always bigger than the percentage of gaze mouth time fixation.
In just one case, a female never looked at another women’ eyes,
just to men’s eyes alone and just a few times; she preferred to
occasionally look at the mouth. She presented a small degree of
deafness. Another extreme case was found in another woman,
who focused on eyes almost the whole time (over 90%). In this
case, rather than being empathetic, the person was found to be
inquisitive, corroborated by the fact that her EDA activity was
flat.
We also analyzed the differences between females and males,
although the amount of men was small compared to women.
There were not substantial differences in the percentage of mouth
fixations, as it can be seen in Figure 8. Only in the percentage of
eye gaze fixations there is a small difference value between males
as females, being bigger for men than for women.
In Table 2, the relationship between the percentage of gaze
eye fixations and EDA values is shown. Antidepressants alter
EDA values, mostly the phasic activity. This information was
collected in the pre-test and correlated to EDA values where
tonic goes down. We related participants with EDA self-control
to values above 50% gaze eye fixations. The exception was people
consuming antidepressants, concretely 3 participants.
Table 3 summarizes the descriptive statistics for the numerical
measures collected during the study. These numerical measures
include the percentages of fixations in the eye tracking and
the minimum and maximum blood pressure values. The table
displays obtained overall values and also shows them per female
and male.

how basic emotions are determined regarding their valence and
arousal in the 2D PAD space and, then, the results for the complex
emotion empathy.

Valence and Arousal for Basic Emotions
With the data collected by Emotiv Headset, it can be
observed that the right hemisphere was clearly generating more
alpha waves between 7 and 10 Hz (see Figure 2) when users
saw unpleasant images. This phenomenon is called frontal
asymmetry and introduced in previous sections. In fact, this
example corresponds to an IAPS image with 1.59 valence and
7.60 arousal. It has been cataloged as unpleasant. Thus, it is
possible to establish a dichotomy between pleasant/unpleasant,
called valence. At the same time, all these results can be related to
GSR and BVP measures too, captured by the Empatica device (see
Figure 3). A correlation, according to the work by Tóth (2015),
can be established. Accelerometer measures were used to discard
signal artifacts due to muscles activity, whereas HB (Heart Beat)
was used as a measure of excitement and validated in the post-test
to rule out users that started the test in an over-excited state that
negatively affected the experimentation session.

Machine Learning Experiments
Table 4 shows the results obtained for each group when a
classification algorithm is applied for emotion recognition, in
addition to the mean values and standard deviation (SD) for
each group of users. The best accuracies obtained per group of
participants are highlighted in bold. The results suggest that there
is no clear algorithm that performs better. L is the algorithm
that performs best for Group1-Non self-regulated (40.9091%),
while MLP shows the best results for Group2-Self-regulated
(42.7035%), and Ripper (42.4606%) for all users together. There
are also no relevant differences among classifiers inside each
group, with the exception of G2, in which NB shows poor
results compared to the rest (29.8003% compared to a mean of
37.9416%), and MLP betters by more than a 1% the outcome of
the second best algorithm.
Following García et al. (2010), we employed two nonparametric methods to compare multiple algorithms, the classical
Friedman test (Friedman, 1937), and a modification by Iman
and Davenport (1980) to detect statistical differences among the

Complex Emotions: Empathy
As it is mentioned in the Introduction, when dealing with
more complex emotions, such as empathy, we must distinguish
two facets, the cognitive and the emotional one. In this work
we have focused on the emotional facet, the most complex
to measure. Following Cowan (2015) gaze empathy patterns,
bounded regions were drawn using Tobii Studio around eyes (see
Figure 4) and mouth. The percentage of gaze time fixation on
eyes (see Figure 4) and mouth were computed then separately by
the eye tracker, with the intention of discerning empathic people.
The basis for this classification is that empathy is correlated

different classification paradigms. In this case, none of the tests
rejected the null hypothesis of equivalence between groups of
participants, since the p-values (0.2725 and 0.2855 respectively)
are not lower than the α-value (0.05). In order to complement
these results, Friedman’s Aligned Rank Test and Quade Test
presented in García et al. (2010) were also used and also did
not reject the null hypothesis, as their p-values were 0.3603 and
0.4396 respectively. Consequently, the resulting p-values indicate
that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that all the algorithms
perform the same, we did not proceed with a post-hoc test.

DISCUSSION
The goal of this study is to establish the validity and the
limitations of a methodology for using devices for eye tracking,
EEG and biometric signal measurement for the study of emotion
in ICT environments. As the objective was that users should
behave as naturally as possible in the ICT environment, the
devices used for different signal data collection were selected to
be the least invasive possible. The results show that it is possible
to adequately combine different data sources to detect both basic
and complex emotions with devices capable of being used in ICT
environments.
Regarding basic emotions detection, there are several models
of emotions that can be used to determine a given emotion.
After reviewing the literature, the model defined in the Pleasure
Arousal and Dominance (PAD) 2D space (Mehrabian and
Russell, 1974) was used to characterize biometric measures. EEG
and EDA are used to get the Valence (Pleasure) and Arousal
values that determine the emotion in the PAD 2D space. On the
other hand, for complex emotions, empathy has been detected
using eye tracking and biometric signals, mainly EDA.

in real-time and not be invasive. In this regard, invasiveness in
HCI environments is not understood exactly as in other areas
in which EEG is used, such as in medicine. The presence of any
annoying object is enough to be considered invasive in HCI, as
users would not be able to interact with the ICT environment in
a natural way. Therefore, the devices for EEG data gathering in
HCI tend to be less invasive and, as a consequence, include less
EEG channels than the devices used in medical environments.
As a consequence, the data gathered is not as accurate in HCI

Invasiveness When Gathering Biometric
Information
Using EEG with other biometric devices requires an appropriate
synchronization among them in order to be used in real ICT
environments where the requirements are that they must work

environments as it is in medicine. This sacrifice is necessary in
order to preserve user comfort.
Fortunately, such loss of accuracy does not imply that
emotions recognition cannot be still performed accurately with
the devices for EEG available in HCI. Emotiv EPOC EEG headset
used in this work includes sensors to capture 14 EEG channels
plus 2 references, which has proven to be enough to measure
valence. This measure is combined with the arousal, determined
by means of a non-invasive wristband, to determine user emotion
using a PAD model based on the 2D space defined by the valence
and arousal dimensions. This hardware for EEG detection has
also been used in other studies for emotion recognition based on
EEG, such as Sourina and Liu (2011).

Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

In fact, the most recent prototypes of EEG devices are
becoming even less invasive, at the risk of losing even more
recall when acquiring EEG data. They are shaped like tiaras
and their electrodes do not need to be hydrated, such as in the
case of the Muse device1 With respect to emotion recognition,
such devices can record enough information to determine frontal
alpha asymmetry related to negative emotions, as the emphasis
is on the difference between hemispheres. Besides, software
algorithms performed over different measures improve accuracy
with the use of machine learning techniques. The economic
aspect is also a limitation in this regard, although the aim of such

inconsistences between gathered information and self-reports
or observations gathered during tests. Interviews and close
observations are important to determine the reasons for various
biometric measures, such as the nervousness of the participants.
As the combination of devices makes it feasible to implement
different preprocessing and data analyzing techniques, using
software other than that used for this study may be important for
a more accurate analysis. In this sense, BCILab software is being
evaluated for use in subsequent experiments.
More biometric information gathering methods can
be added. For instance, Rainville et al. (2006) combined
electrocardiography and respiratory activity recorded during
the recall and experiential reliving of one or two potent
emotional autobiographical episodes and a neutral episode.
However, the use of it must be carefully integrated with other
information gathering methods, as the information must be
properly synchronized, which is not always an easy task. Besides,
non-invasiveness of used signal detection devices must also be
taken into account.

devices is not to detect diseases, which requires greater precision
in the technology used.

Self-Regulation

Benefits of Signal Combination

The use of biometric signals has allowed us to find people who
control their own emotions while being tested. Self-control of
emotions may be due to a conscious effort or be a learned skill.
For instance, in the education of medical doctors, role-playing
techniques are used in which students are educated to play a
role and they learn how to control their emotions. It can lead to
showing flat EDA activity.
A priori, it seems that people with self-control tend to look
directly into the eyes. Moderated phasic activity is related to
values below 50% of gaze eye fixations, which theoretically
correspond to less empathic people. In order to detect if it
is true affective empathy or just people trying to imitate a
behavior, which would correspond to the cognitive empathy
facet, more variables such as mimicry should be correlated. In
fact, facial mimicry is related to muscles activity and there is a
correspondence between the facial muscles and Ekman’s six basic
emotions: happiness, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, and surprise
(Matzke et al., 2013). Flat responses on EDA values correspond
with no mimicry in the 90% of cases.
Video cameras and software to establish facial movement
have been helpful to detect mimicry. Emotiv EPOC EEG
can also be used for this because it also includes two facial
muscles sensors. In this sense, data redundancy is found to be
convenient.
For our surprise, we discovered than twenty-one users
controlled his/her EDA activity. Their EDA activity was normal
before we told them that the experiment was to begin.
Afterwards, it became flat or nearly zero as it can be visualized
in Figure 3, where EDA decreases and decreases till drawing a
very flat “U,” nearly zero. We have tried to find some profiles with
some equal characteristics as we are going to see in the following
paragraphs.

As it has been mentioned throughout the article, the combined
use of different devices to gather different kinds of signals, like eye
tracking, EEG or biometric signals has been useful to determine
emotions. Regarding the advantages of the combined use, there
are several aspects that are worth being taken into account as
detailed below.
Both pre-tests and post-tests have been crucial to detect
relevant aspects associated with the study, going from drug
consumption (antidepressants) to deafness detection. Both tools
are relevant to contextualize biometric data gathered in the study.
The eye tracker device has proved to be a useful tool in order
to visualize what the user is really doing and a useful complement
of other sources. Therefore, its use is highly advocated whenever
possible, although its economic cost is also an aspect to be taken
into account. As it has been explained in the previous sections,
it can be used to detect empathy combined with EDA. Besides,
more patterns of gazing explorations were found. Although they
have not been related to emotions yet, some users did not look
at the context of the image, they just focused on the problem
or disease displayed in the images. This is work in progress and
we are currently exploring the correlations with other variables
recorded with the different devices.
EDA activity has also proven very useful. It is divided
into phasic and tonic. The tonic part provides a measure of
arousal and is related to mood, while the phasic part, which
reflects instant changes in arousal, represents quick changes in
excitement and is related to individual stimuli. For this study, it
has been important to have devices that allowed us to measure
and monitor both of them. Additionally, the values gathered by
the accelerometer, heartbeats and BVP have been used to discard
or to evidence some other problems as movement or excitement
about something.
Altogether, we have shown that biometric measures that detect
emotional responses can be used to correlate to information
coming from questionnaires or to detect consistencies and

instance, they have shown that power spectrum across all
frequency bands extracted from EEG signals perform well on
distinguishing positive and negative emotional states (Wang
et al., 2014). Different kinds of algorithms have been used,
including SVMs (Liu et al., 2014), Neural Networks (Peng et al.,
2005), or K-NN (Wang et al., 2011). Still, no references have been
found by the authors in the literature dealing with self-regulation,
emotions and machine learning. Therefore, it has been necessary
to consider as many algorithms as possible to determine the
validity of the proposed process, including preprocessing and
synchronization.

This work presents a method to improve EEG based emotion
recognition by combining it with synchronized biometric and
eye tracking technologies in a non-invasive and low cost way.
The method is aimed at combining these techniques, adequately
synchronizing their data sources, in ICT environments. Gathered
information has been used to detect different emotions the users
experienced while watching a predefined set of stimuli based
on the IAPS set of images and the MindReading corpus of
videos. The equipment used to monitor users experience was

• An elevated percentage eye gaze fixations (>80%) could be
interpreted as inquisitive rather empathic.
• Flat responses on EDA values correspond to users with no

emotional one.

Volume Pulse, Acceleration, Heart Rate, and Temperature. This
kind of equipment is relatively low cost and is the only one
required to reproduce the study. After exposing users to stimuli
and monitoring their reactions using the previous equipment,
the gathered data has been synchronized and analyzed in the
ways described in subsections Data Managing and Data Analysis
Remarks using ad-hoc scripts.
We have been able to determine the basic emotions
participants were experiencing by means of valence and arousal.

Furthermore, the machine learning study that has been
performed has allowed determining that EEG alone is not a good
indicator of self-regulation when processing affective stimuli.
This supports the hypothesis that different biometric signal data
sources should be considered together in order to determine
self-regulation related to emotional stimuli.
As future work, it is foreseen to further improve the pretest in order to detect deafness and personality traits such as
shyness prior to the beginning of future studies. Apart from
that, the use of machine learning techniques will allow us to
predict an accurate valence degree. In this sense, EEG alone
has proved to be a useful technique to indicate frontal alpha
