This review explores how diﬀerent environments aﬀect brain activity and associated mood response. MEDLINE,
CINAHL, Web of Science, PsychInfo and EMBASE were searched for peer-reviewed literature published prior to
February 2019. 26 sources were included and divided into either a laboratory (n = 17) or naturalistic (n = 9)
design. Most (n = 16) compared natural environments against urban/non-natural environments. Natural environments were associated with low frequency brainwaves and lower brain activity in frontal areas, indicating
comfortable and subjectively restorative feelings. Urban environments appear to induce brain responses associated with negative aﬀect (demonstrated in an overactive amygdala region). Furthermore, urban environments
were associated with activation of the posterior cingulate cortex associated with top-down processing/eﬀortful
attention. A sensory accumulation eﬀect is suggested, where the realism of an experimental condition, and
therefore validity of participant responses, is greater when more senses are engaged. Longitudinal research is
needed to determine whether chronic exposure to environments can promote change in brain behaviour.

1. Introduction
In any given environment, a person is exposed to a variety of inﬂuential stimuli which impact individual quality of life, psycho-emotional health and overall health and wellbeing (Brown et al., 2008;
Dadvand et al., 2016; Trasande et al., 2008; Triguero-Mas et al., 2015).
For example, research has established that odours in built environments
eﬀect mood (Lehrner, Eckersberger, Walla, Pötsch, & Deecke, 2000),
noise impacts sleep quality (Carter, 1996; Halonen et al., 2012) and
depressive symptoms (Orban et al., 2015), temperature eﬀects decision
making (Gaoua, Grantham, Racinais, & El Massioui, 2012) and haptic
experience eﬀects motivation for outdoor activity (Brown, 2017). In
particular, access and exposure to natural environments are associated
with improved health outcomes across a variety of domains. For example, exposure to the natural environment is associated with better
general health (De Vries, Verheij, Groenewegen, & Spreeuwenberg,
2003), better sustained attention (Lee, Williams, Sargent, Williams, &
Johnson, 2015) and people experience less stress when in a room with
real nature compared to synthetic nature (Beukeboom, Langeveld, &
Tanja-Dijkstra, 2012). Evidently, various characteristics of the built and
natural environment have considerable impact on quality of life outcomes. However, the physiological impact of diverse environments is

not as well understood (Bailey, Allen, Herndon, & Demastus, 2018;
Chiang, Li, & Jane, 2017). Frumkin et al. (2017) detailed an agenda for
future natural environment research and emphasised the importance of
investigating the physiological mechanisms underpinning self-reported
and observed psycho-emotional health outcomes.
Measuring brain activity is an objective method of assessing the
physiological impact of engaging with the environment (Keshavarz,
Campos, & Berti, 2015; Schäfer et al., 2015). Brain imaging is useful for
measuring the eﬀects of unconscious or masked stimuli (Teplan, 2002;
Whalen et al., 1998). For example, the brain has well recognised patterns of activity for various emotional responses (LeDoux, 2009) and
states of alertness or rest (Aston-Jones, 2005; Greicius, Krasnow, Reiss,
& Menon, 2003).
Diﬀerent neuroimaging techniques produce diﬀerent outputs.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive measure of surface
cortical electrical activity generated by brain structures (Teplan, 2002).
EEG responses to emotional stimuli are well studied (Carretié, Iglesias,
& Garcı́;a, 1997; Cuthbert, Schupp, Bradley, Birbaumer, & Lang, 2000;
Pollatos, Kirsch, & Schandry, 2005). For example, EEG patterns have
identiﬁed left frontal activation associated with increased positive
mood (Waldstein et al., 2000) and frontal alpha activation with relaxed
wakefulness (Cacioppo, Tassinary, & Berntson, 2007). Functional

magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an alternative neuroimaging
method that maps haemodynamic changes in the brain with increased
blood ﬂow being interpreted as increased brain activity (Logothetis,
Pauls, Augath, Trinath, & Oeltermann, 2001). fMRI ﬁndings have established the role of the amygdala and hippocampus in processing fear
(Zelikowsky, Hersman, Chawla, Barnes, & Fanselow, 2014) and negative aﬀect (Doré et al., 2018), and the role of the subcallosal cingulate
in processing sadness (Phan, Wager, Taylor, & Liberzon, 2002). Nearinfrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measures brain activity through the detection of cerebral blood ﬂow. NIRS allows for non-invasive brain activity measurement, is easy to use, and is often a cheaper alternative to
fMRI and EEG. Further, NIRS is well suited to studies of emotion
(Balconi & Molteni, 2016). For example, in the emotional processing of
visual and auditory stimuli, where NIRS showed activation of temporal
areas (Maria et al., 2018); activation in prefrontal areas when participants recall emotional events (Ohtani, Matsuo, Kasai, Kato, & Kato,
2005); improved mood following mindful breathing being associated
with frontal activation (Matsubara et al., 2018). In summary, research
has established the presence of diﬀerent patterns of brain activity in
response to diﬀerent emotional responses.
An initial study measuring the eﬀect of environment on brain activity and associated moods was conducted by Ulrich (1981), who
found increased alpha waves and less subjective emotional stress
among participants who viewed slides of nature. However, the body of
research since then has not been reviewed. In cognitive psychology,
brain measures are criticised for being unable to add any new information to the literature since the seventies (Sawyer, 2011) and it is
unclear if this is also the case for environmental psychology.
Given the need for further research to understand the eﬀects of
engaging with diverse environments on the brain (Coburn, Vartanian, &
Chatterjee, 2017; Frumkin et al., 2017), this paper presents a systematic
review of research investigating the impact of engaging with built and
natural environments on brain activity and associated mood. Speciﬁcally, this review sought to:

landscape*). Details of the ﬁelds searched and sources identiﬁed from
each database have been included in Table 1 below.
2.2. Eligibility criteria
Studies were included in this review if they were peer-reviewed and
written in the English language. No date restrictions were set. Studies
must have investigated the impact of exposure to environment on mood
or emotion using a measurement of brain activity (structure or function). Furthermore, studies must have clearly described the methodology and environments to which participants were exposed.
2.3. Screening and study selection
Papers were screened in ﬁve steps, (a) duplicate screening using the
reference management system Endnote© (Reuters, 2013), (b) exclusions
based on title, (c) duplicate screening based on visual search, (d) exclusions based on abstract, and (e) exclusions based on full text. Fig. 1
below includes a ﬂow-chart detailing the screening process.
2.4. Data extraction and synthesis
Data was extracted and information was collated on the following:
(i) citation, (ii) sample, (iii) setting (laboratory or naturalistic) (iv)
neuroimaging technique (e.g. NIRS) (v) mood or emotion measure (e.g.
self-report scale), (v) conditions (e.g. urban, natural, urban green, virtual etc.), (vi) outcomes (e.g. EEG signal, NIRS output, subjective
scores), (vii) identiﬁed brain regions, and (viii) author conclusions.

1.) Identify how environments aﬀect brain activity and associated
psychological responses.
2.) Synthesise current research and identify research gaps.
2. Method
This systematic review was guided by the PRISMA approach
(Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaﬀ, & Altman, 2009) for conducting systematic
reviews and details around the review aims and methods are also registered within the PROSPERO register for systematic review protocols
(Lakhani et al., 2018b).

2.5. Quality appraisal
The quantitative version of the McMasters rating tool (Law et al.,
1998) was used to assess studies methodological quality. The McMasters Critical Review Form for Quantitative Studies is a methodological
quality assessment tool frequently used within systematic reviews
synthesising quantitative studies (see Lakhani, Norwood, Watling,
Zeeman, & Kendall, 2018a; Lakhani, Townsend, & Bishara, 2017; Li
et al., 2016; Norwood et al., 2019; Swanberg et al., 2018). The review
form includes eight overarching criteria. These eight criteria are underpinned by 14 domains which can be answered as yes, or no response
options. Furthermore, some domains have ‘not applicable’ or ‘not addressed’ response options. Consequently, studies within this review
were rated against these 14 domains. For each study, a rating of ‘yes’
was designated with a 1, while ‘no’ or ‘not addressed’, designated with a
0. Two researchers independently rated the studies and any quality
appraisal inconsistencies between reviewers were discussed by the ﬁrst,
second, and fourth author until a consensus was reached.

2.1. Search strategy
The following databases were searched for peer-reviewed literature
published at any date (with dates in brackets): MEDLINE (19 September
2017), CINAHL (19 September 2017), Web of Science (19 September
2017), PsychInfo (21 September 2017) and EMBASE (21 September
2017). A second search was made in the same databases for papers
published from 2017 to February 25th, 2019. The following search
string was utilised throughout all databases: (Electroencephalography
OR EEG OR “quantitative EEG” OR qEEG OR “event related potential”
OR ERP OR “brain oscillations” OR “brain activity” OR “cerebral activity” OR “brain response*” OR “Magnetic resonance imaging” OR MRI
OR “functional magnetic resonance imaging” OR fMRI OR “time resolved spectroscopy” OR “Near-infrared spectroscopy” OR NIRS OR
“Positron Emission Tomography” OR PET OR Magnetoencephalography
OR MEG) AND (built OR urban OR “physical environment” OR “spatial
environment” OR “virtual environment” OR environment OR communit* OR natural OR nature OR green* OR “blue space” OR park OR
parks OR wilderness OR bush OR countryside OR forest OR garden* OR

3. Results
Twenty-six studies were included in the review (see Table 2); the
screening process is displayed in Fig. 1. Of the 26, 17 took place in a
laboratory setting and 9 were naturalistic.

and a control condition.
Three studies used a virtual environment design. Two used EEG,
both exploring the notion of ‘presence’ in a virtual environment, and
one NIRS exploring the eﬀect of 3D versus 2D displays. Together, studies show the importance of presenting virtual environments with as
many senses stimulated as possible to increase eﬀects on mood and
feeling of presence.
In the following sections (3.3.1–3.3.5) neurological and subjective
results are listed as the included studies reported them. Synthesis and
critical discussion of included studies’ ﬁndings in relation to each other
and previous literature is provided in sections 3.4 and 4.

3.1. Characteristics of studies
Fourteen studies employed EEG as the measure of brain activity,
seven employed NIRS or time-resolved spectroscopy (NIRS/TRS) and
ﬁve employed fMRI (See Table 2 for full characteristics of studies table).
3.2. Quality assessment
Inter-rater reliability between the two researchers was moderate to
substantial (Cohen-Kappa (unweighted) = 0.56). The methodological
quality assessment of each article is provided in Table 3. The range of
quality appraisal scores for included papers was 9–13 (out of 14) and
the average was 11.19.

3.3.1. Laboratory: urban vs natural environment images
Eight studies compared urban and natural environments using
images as stimuli (Chang & Chen, 2005; Kim et al., 2010; Kim & Jeong,
2014; Lee, 2017; Martínez-Soto et al., 2013; Roe et al., 2013; Tang
et al., 2017; Ulrich, 1981). All eight studies reported the natural environment conditions as producing positive or subjectively favoured
states. Three studies employed EEG and two of these found that natural
scenes were associated with low frequency waves in various regions of
the brain (Chang & Chen, 2005; Ulrich, 1981). The third used an EEG
cap that does not provide frequency bands as outputs (Roe et al., 2013).
EEG data output was interpreted by the manufacturer's software as
indicating levels of: short-term excitement, long-term excitement,
meditation, engagement and frustration. The researchers further sorted
these into two larger categories of arousal (short and long-term

3.3. Summary of ﬁndings
Fifteen studies compared urban and natural environments either in
the laboratory using images (n = 8) or in naturalistic settings (n = 7).
Seven of the studies used EEG and eight used fMRI/NIRS and all found
neurological responses and associated emotional responses to natural
images or features of the actual environment.
Eight studies compared the eﬀects of speciﬁc environmental characteristics either in the laboratory (n = 6) or in naturalistic settings
(n = 2). Five of the studies used EEG and three used fMRI/NIRS and all
found neurological responses and associated emotional responses differed between the speciﬁc characteristic of the environment in question

Characteristics of studies.

Interior setting alpha in frontal lobe higher
than edge setting

In green setting EEG indicated meditation
state was higher and engagement and
frustration were lower.
Haptic sensory experiences were most
important for the feeling of presence and
increased excitement as measured by the
EEG.
Alpha waves in frontal lobes in less stressful
conditions (temperature of 25 degrees
Celsius, no road noises or unpleasant smells).
High beta in temporal lobe in hot, urban
noisy and unpleasant smell conditions.
Theta band power in the right frontotemporal and left temporo-parietal regions
associated with direct/indirect lighting over
purely direct lighting.
Theta power in the right frontal region
showed a positive correlation with lighting
seen as “cool”.
High presence showed increased theta power
across frontal and left temporal lobes.
High familiarity and comfort in frontal
midline.
Pleasantness resulted in alpha band
desynchronization of left parietal and frontal
sites.
Pleasant and comfortable VEs showed a
desynchronization of the mu rhythm in the
left hemisphere.
EEG headset predetermined outputs for
‘meditation’ and ‘attention’ were higher in
TND

No signiﬁcant diﬀerences found between
environmental satisfaction and EEG
Theta power associated with area
satisfaction and delta power associated with
height satisfaction

Nature and plants had signiﬁcantly higher
alpha levels in right prefrontal lobe. Any
window view resulted in high alpha in left
prefrontal lobe.
Urban scenes correlated with arousal.
Landscape scenes correlated with interest.
Landscape scenes associated with greater
meditation and lower arousal scores.

Higher alpha in both nature scenes compared
with urban in central parietal lobe

brain response and mood, with one using roses (Song et al., 2017) and
the other green foliage (Park et al., 2016). Participants entered the
room and looked at a box on a table. When the box was removed, it
revealed an empty space or the natural item. Both studies found less
activation in the right prefrontal cortex during exposure and associated
this with physiological and psychological relaxation and improved
mood, however the lack of an active control means it is diﬃcult to
conﬁrm eﬀects were due to the natural element, or just the presence of
anything at all. Four studies explored speciﬁc characteristics of environments and the eﬀect on the brain. An inner forest location promoted alpha activity more than forest edge (on the border of forest and
open land) and outer forest locations (viewing forest from a position
outside the forest on open land) and were reported as being more
subjectively relaxing (Chiang et al., 2017). Igarashi et al. (2015) aimed
to compare the eﬀects of viewing a real natural item (foliage plants)
versus a projected image of the same natural item. Real nature promoted a stronger physiological response in the prefrontal cortices than
artiﬁcial nature, with no diﬀerences in subjective responses (Igarashi
et al., 2015). Increased theta activity was found in right fronto-temporal
and left temporo-parietal when participants were placed in more subjectively pleasant lighting environments (Shin et al., 2015). Finally, the
combination of natural sounds, no odours and 25C temperature was
rated as the least stressful environment for individuals and this was
associated with low frequency EEG waves (Choi et al., 2015). Individual
characteristics of an environment eﬀect mood and the brain response
has shown some success as a part of a measurement of this mood.

excitement and low meditation) and interest (engagement and low
frustration). The subjective ﬁndings concluded that natural scenes
provided signiﬁcantly higher levels of attractiveness, willingness to
visit, and level of pleasure. EEG results established that urban images
were correlated with the arousal group while landscape scenes correlated with the interest group and high meditation (Roe et al., 2013).
Five studies used fMRI/NIRS and all found that various urban environments were associated with activity in frontal and prefrontal lobes
(Kim et al., 2010; Lee, 2017), parts of the limbic system (Kim et al.,
2010; Kim & Jeong, 2014) and the cuneus and cingulate gyrus
(Martínez-Soto et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2017). Urban scenes were associated with a fear response (Kim et al., 2010; Ulrich, 1981), stress
(Chang & Chen, 2005; Choi et al., 2015), eﬀortful cognitive processing
(Martínez-Soto et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2017), and sadness (Ulrich,
1981); whereas natural scenes were associated with happiness (Kim
et al., 2010), wellbeing (Chang & Chen, 2005), cognitive restoration
(Martínez-Soto et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2017) and attention (Ulrich,
1981).
3.3.2. Naturalistic: urban vs natural environment
Seven studies compared a natural, green environment with a nonnatural (urban or indoor) environment (Aspinall et al., 2013; Bailey
et al., 2018; Bratman et al., 2015; Joung et al., 2015; Neale et al., 2017;
Park et al., 2007; Tilley et al., 2017). All seven studies reported that
natural environments were positively experienced when compared to
non-natural environments. Four studies employed EEG and found that
natural settings promoted increased meditation, relaxation (Bailey
et al., 2018) and engagement (Neale et al., 2017), and non-natural
environments promoted higher levels of arousal (Aspinall et al., 2013;
Neale et al., 2017), frustration and engagement (Aspinall et al., 2013;
Tilley et al., 2017). Three studies used fMRI/NIRS and found that
natural settings were associated with decreased activity in the subgenual prefrontal cortex (Bratman et al., 2015) and prefrontal cortices
(Joung et al., 2015; Park et al., 2007). These researchers concluded that
natural settings were cognitively restorative (Aspinall et al., 2013;
Bailey et al., 2018; Neale et al., 2017), relaxing (Park et al., 2007) and
reduced rumination (Bratman et al., 2015).

3.3.4. Naturalistic: speciﬁc characteristics of an environment
Two studies explored the eﬀects of speciﬁc environmental characteristics in a naturalistic setting (Hollander & Foster, 2016; Qin et al.,
2013). Qin et al. (2013) explored subjective preferences of speciﬁc
characteristics - such as colour, area and height - of a natural environment. Then, using EEG, they compared brain waves of participants
in environments reported as preferred versus non-preferred. They found
that environments with participant reported preferred height and area
characteristics were associated with lower frequency waves (Qin et al.,
2013). Another study found that traditional neighbourhood design
(TND), which was characterised as having mixed-use buildings with
clear patterns and structure to the roads and architecture, promoted
EEG outputs associated with meditation and attentiveness compared to
a non-TND, which was described as more recently built and having
little architectural character and taller, single use buildings (Hollander
& Foster, 2016).

3.3.3. Laboratory: speciﬁc characteristics of an environment
Six studies explored the eﬀects of speciﬁc environmental characteristics in a laboratory setting (Chiang et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2015;
Igarashi et al., 2015; Park et al., 2016; Shin et al., 2015; Song et al.,
2017). Two studies explored the eﬀect of an individual natural item on

by delta, theta and alpha activity that indicated favourable mood states
(Qin et al., 2013; Shin et al., 2015). This ﬁnding is similar to those in
portable EEG studies ﬁnding states of ‘meditation’ higher in natural
settings (Aspinall et al., 2013; Roe et al., 2013) and preferred neighbourhood designs (Hollander & Foster, 2016). Subjectively, these conditions were reported as preferred by participants in terms of being
more attractive, relaxing, facilitating a favourable mood state/arousal
or as decreasing anxiety or stress. Clearly, the synthesis of included
literature suggests that lower frequency EEG bands may be the signature of more comfortable or restorative environments and associated
positive subjective moods. This ﬁnding is supported, and partly explained, by two existing studies. Firstly, Hagerhall et al. (2015) who
used EEG to investigate the brain response and mood of participants
viewing (n = 35) either images of statistical fractal patterns (similar to
the natural geometrical patterns of clouds, rivers and mountains found
in nature) or exact fractal patterns (mathematically exact geometric
patterns). Participants were exposed to three sets of three fractal image
patterns, where images gradually moved from exact fractals to statistical fractal patterns. The ﬁndings were such that alpha levels increased
and were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between viewing exact fractals to statistical fractals. In other words, viewing fractals aligned with natural
images were associated with higher levels of alpha power in the left
hemisphere of the brain. Secondly, Coburn et al. (2019) presented
participants with images of visual patterns in architecture. They found a
buildings naturalness rating was higher when it had low-level visual
features, such as contrast and scaling, (including intricate and layered
fractal scales similar to statistical fractal patterns) and that a higher
naturalness rating was preferred. This aligns with the included studies
ﬁnding higher alpha in natural settings, made up of statistical fractal
patterns, and lower alpha in urban settings, or exact fractal patterns
(Bailey et al., 2018; Chang & Chen, 2005; Chiang et al., 2017; Choi
et al., 2015). This suggests that reported mood in relation to any environment may be partly down to the brain response to the patterns in
the setting.
In general, EEG ﬁndings matched those obtained through fMRI and
NIRS data. Higher levels of alpha EEG are said to correlate with lower
activation in fMRI studies (Goldman, Stern, Engel Jr, & Cohen, 2002;
Laufs et al., 2003; Moosmann et al., 2003). Exposure to natural environments was associated with positive self-reported feelings of relaxation, restoration, and comfort or preferences, higher alpha on EEG
and low activation on fMRI and NIRS (Igarashi et al., 2014; Joung et al.,
2015; Lee, 2017; Park et al., 2007, 2016; Song et al., 2017). This pattern
of ﬁndings supports the conclusion that the positive eﬀect of natural
environments on mood is likely to occur via a brain-mediated process.
Although alpha rhythms are consistently associated with comfortable and restorative environments, there are some contrasting ﬁndings.
For example, Choi et al. (2015) reported alpha in the frontal lobes as
representing relaxation and high beta in the temporal lobe in uncomfortable conditions which were too hot, noisy and contained unpleasant odours which they interpreted as reﬂecting stress. In contrast,
Chang and Chen (2005) interpreted frontal beta as relaxation. However,
both studies support their own conclusion with behavioural or psychological data. This informs us of the importance of supplementing
EEG with other data to assist in interpretation. As one included author
states “not all neuroscience literature agrees on EEG indicators, with
various measures and labels being reported in previous research”
(Bailey et al., 2018). For example, as reported here, alpha activity is
frequently linked with beneﬁcial eﬀects of nature, however, alpha activity is also associated with creative ideation (Fink & Benedek, 2014)
and boredom or mental fatigue (Elpidorou, 2018; Fan, Zhou, Liu, & Xie,
2015). Given the ambiguity around the mood states associated with
brain activity, subjective measures complimenting objective brain
imaging techniques are vital towards establishing the impact of engaging with built and natural environments on individual mood states and
in assisting researchers from not over-interpreting brain imaging data.

3.3.5. Laboratory: virtual environment (VE) designs
Three studies used a VE design. Two studies required participants to
rate the feeling of ‘presence’ (i.e., the feeling of being actually present
within the virtual environment). One study reported that a greater
sense of presence, familiarity, and comfort was associated with theta
activity in frontal lobes and increased frontal and midline theta activity
represented focused attention and positive emotions (Vecchiato et al.,
2015). The second study reported the eﬀects of each sense (e.g. smell,
sound, touch) on presence felt in VE and found touch was the most
important sensory stimulus (Azevedo et al., 2015) and that this was
associated with an increase in EEG measures of excitement. The third
study compared the relaxing eﬀects of viewing 3D versus 2D images of
the natural environment. 3D images promoted greater levels of decreased right prefrontal activity compared to 2D images, presumably
because 3D images were more subjectively relaxing (Igarashi et al.,
2014).
3.4. Synthesis
This review has found evidence from multiple studies that higher
alpha is recorded by EEG in frontal lobes in response to natural and
other positively perceived settings (Bailey et al., 2018; Chang & Chen,
2005; Chiang et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2015). Similarly, fMRI/NIRS
ﬁndings demonstrated less activation in frontal lobes in response to
natural scenes (Igarashi et al., 2014; Joung et al., 2015; Lee, 2017; Park
et al., 2007, 2016; Song et al., 2017), indicating lower stress and increased comfort and relaxation. In contrast, studies generally showed
that urban environments induced greater activation in the posterior
cingulate cortex reﬂecting purposeful attention (i.e. top-down) and a
higher demand for information processing (Martínez-Soto et al., 2013;
Tang et al., 2017). Urban scenes placed greater demand on visual
processing (Kim et al., 2010; Tang et al., 2017). Studies also showed
that the limbic system (e.g. hippocampus, amygdala, insula) was more
active in uncomfortable urban, and other uncomfortable environments,
reﬂecting more negative emotional stimulation (Kim et al., 2010; Kim &
Jeong, 2014). In contrast, natural environments stimulated activation
in the basal ganglia which was absent when viewing an urban scene
(Kim et al., 2010) and reﬂected happiness.
The ﬁndings also demonstrated low frequency theta power may
reﬂect subjectively reported ‘pleasant’ characteristics of an environment, such as in ambient lighting and VE environment (Shin et al.,
2015; Vecchiato et al., 2015). Theta power was also associated with
satisfaction about the area of a setting and delta power was associated
with satisfaction about height of a setting (Qin et al., 2013). In support
of this, high frequency beta waves in the temporal lobe may reﬂect
stress in an uncomfortable indoor environment (e.g. uncomfortable
heat, odour, noise) (Choi et al., 2015).
In virtual environments, touch is the most important sensation that
enhanced the feeling of presence (Azevedo et al., 2015), feeling of
presence is associated with increased theta power across frontal and left
temporal lobes (Vecchiato et al., 2015).
4. Discussion
4.1. Preferred or positively experienced environments
The ﬁndings have generally conﬁrmed that natural environments
and pleasant sensory experiences trigger low frequency rhythms in the
frontal lobes associated with lower stress and higher relaxation. Higher
alpha rhythms in the frontal lobes are found primarily in nature-based
conditions (Bailey et al., 2018; Chang & Chen, 2005; Chiang et al.,
2017; Choi et al., 2015) but also in settings with comfortable levels of
heat, noise and scent (Choi et al., 2015) representing lower stress and
relaxed wakefulness (Thakor & Sherman, 2013, pp. 259–303). When
participants indicated preference for a particular design feature in the
natural or non-natural environment, this preference was accompanied

Restoration Theory (ART). In an incompatible person-environment interaction, cognitive resources are depleted; an environment with restorative qualities allows recovery from this state (Kaplan, 1983).
Several studies ﬁnd natural environments as restorative and alpha EEG,
lower blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signals and lower blood
ﬂow in the pre-frontal cortex may represent a physiological signature of
this process (Aspinall et al., 2013; Chiang et al., 2017; Martínez-Soto
et al., 2013; Neale et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2017). Furthermore, activation in the cingulate gyrus was found in urban environments which
reﬂects directed, eﬀortful attention which is depleting of cognitive resources (Martínez-Soto et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2017).

4.2. Undesirable environments
Non-natural urban environments often induce a negative emotional
response compared to natural environments. Findings from this review
suggest that urban scenes activated the amygdala and hippocampus
when compared to natural scenes. Studies interpreted this as the presence of negative mood or emotion in urban environments and corroborated this with subjective data (Kim et al., 2010; Kim & Jeong, 2014).
Past research supports this interpretation by reporting an over reactive
amygdala as being associated with mood disorders (Drevets & Raichle,
1992), amygdala-hippocampal connectivity as related to increased negative emotion (Doré et al., 2018) and that the hippocampus and
amygdala play a role in fear and responses to threat (Moscarello &
Maren, 2018). In contextual fear, the dorsal hippocampus has been
shown to be responsible for spatial properties of the context and the
amygdala for the emotional valence of the context (Zelikowsky et al.,
2014). Similarly, it is possible the activation of the amygdala and
hippocampus in an urban environment may represent the two regions
working on one process but with separate purposes.
An alternative, not altogether contradictory, analysis is also possible. Activation of the amygdala is not always a sign of negative mood
but of emotional valence (Zelikowsky et al., 2014). Kim et al. (2010)
found subjects rated the natural scenes as “peaceful” and the urban
scenes as “suﬀocated”. It is possible to interpret the presence of
amygdala activity in the urban scene as representing greater emotional
valence as opposed to simply negative emotion. The lack of amygdala
activity in natural scenes may reﬂect the relatively lowly charged
feeling of “peaceful”. It is important studies provide precise subjective
data and account for valence rather than assuming amygdala activity
equates to negative mood.
Down regulation of the posterior hippocampus has been shown to
be predictive of reduced negative aﬀect (Doré et al., 2018); providing a
possible neural mechanism to facilitate the decrease of negative aﬀect
in uncomfortable urban environments. Practices such as meditation
(e.g. mindfulness) have been shown to alter amygdala and hippocampus activity and positively aﬀect associated mood and emotional
responses (Hatchard et al., 2017; Kral et al., 2018; Leung et al., 2018;
Saleem & Samudrala, 2017). This suggests that in typically uncomfortable environments, practices such as mindfulness may be able
to promote fewer amygdala and hippocampal responses associated with
negative emotional states, and possibly the negative emotional states
themselves.

4.4. Virtual environments
A relatively new method to exploring person-environment interaction is the use of VE. The VE data supports laboratory and naturalistic
data in terms of lower EEG wave bands in comfortable environments.
However, speciﬁcally, they ﬁnd theta power associated with comfortable VE's high on feelings of ‘presence’ (Vecchiato et al., 2015). Another study found ‘excitement’ was associated with the feeling of presence but a lack of access to EEG manufacturers algorithms means this
ﬁnding is hard to contextualise (Azevedo et al., 2015). The main contribution to the ﬁndings from this paper made by VE studies is regarding the cumulative eﬀect of diﬀerent sensory experiences on feelings of presence. This should be considered by any research design
which aims to investigate the environments eﬀect on people in a laboratory setting.
4.5. Sensory accumulation eﬀect & ecological validity
The variety of designs employed - and outcomes found - in included
studies is informative of the need for environments which consider all
the senses in their design. A synthesis of the studies suggests a sensory
accumulation eﬀect of the environment on the brain where in research
design, the eﬀect and realism is greater when stimuli for each sense is
added. For example, Ulrich (1981) used colour slides as stimuli, but
even in this early research the author recognised there was more to
nature than just what we see. Currently, portable EEG and NIRS allows
for research which can employ all the senses, a possibility which is
important considering the ﬁndings that real plants are associated with
greater blood ﬂow than fake plants (Igarashi et al., 2015), 3D images
facilitate physiological relaxation more than 2D (Igarashi et al., 2014),
area and height characteristics of a setting have diﬀerent EEG outputs
(Qin et al., 2013), touch is important for realism of VE (Azevedo et al.,
2015), indoor lighting variants may eﬀect theta power (Shin et al.,
2015) and temperature, noise and smell eﬀect EEG in the same settings
(Choi et al., 2015). Therefore, the sensory accumulation eﬀect may account for people's preference for real over fake nature (Igarashi et al.,
2015) and the previous ﬁnding that real plants in a hospital waiting
room resulted in lower perceived stress in patients when compared to
the eﬀect of fake plants, even though patients' attention was not speciﬁcally drawn to whether or not the plant was real or artiﬁcial
(Beukeboom et al., 2012). An extension to this is how much eﬀect exposure time has on brain activity. There is large variation between
exposure time from a few seconds (Igarashi et al., 2015; Song et al.,
2017) to 90 minutes (Bratman et al., 2015) and although even limited
exposure appears to be required for brain activity to change in the
short-term, longer exposure may change the strength or nature of a
person's reaction. A recent study found 2 hours of nature contact a week
was associated with self-reporting of good health or higher well-being
(White et al., 2019). The authors suggest longitudinal studies are required to develop green exposure guidelines. Clearly an understanding
of a ‘dose-response’ relationship between greenspace and its eﬀects on
the brain, mood or cognition has yet to be fully established and is
worthy of further study.
The sensory accumulation eﬀect is particularly important given the

4.3. Support for theory
Within some included studies we ﬁnd neurological evidence for the
person-environment compatibility model, which states that human
functioning in busy sensory environments, such as some urban locations, comes at a cost of more eﬀortful processing (Kaplan, 1983). For
example, Kim et al. (2010) suggest urban scenes result in greater activation of the primary visual cortex and that this is because of greater
processing needs. Additionally, two studies report urban environments
as associated with activity in the posterior cingulate cortex reﬂecting
purposeful, top-down attention and more eﬀortful information processing (Martínez-Soto et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2017). This may also be
true in non-urban environments with enclosed rooms more likely to
activate the cingulate gyrus over preferred open rooms (Vartanian
et al., 2015). Similarly, the person-environment compatibility model
states that eﬀortful processing results in attention depletion which can
promote stress, distractibility and reactance (Kaplan, 1983). The notion
of attentional demand being higher in urban environments is becoming
common (Grassini et al., 2019). It is recommended built environments
are designed to minimise sensory noise to reduce redundant additional
neural processing. This will delay the onset of attention depletion and
associated negative eﬀects.
Within this synthesis are several studies supporting Attention9

increase of VE studies and the ﬁnding that diﬀerent qualities eﬀect the
presence experienced (Azevedo et al., 2015) and that presence may
have an EEG signature (Vecchiato et al., 2015). VE studies in particular
need to be aware of how incorporating as many sense stimuli as possible may increase presence, and which stimuli are more important.
When designing research conditions in VE, the inclusion of touch as
well as the more common senses of hearing and sight might be more
important (Azevedo et al., 2015). These ﬁndings from VE studies may
also inform laboratory brain imaging studies where touch is also a less
common sense included in design. Again, exposure time is of interest to
VE; the inclusion of additional senses also increases realism and presence. However, an interaction between exposure and presence may
exist. Speciﬁcally, longer exposure may also increase a sense of presence.
In addition, this sensory accumulation eﬀect shows the importance of
ecologically valid study designs. Designs which focus on one sense may
not provide a full picture of the eﬀect of the chosen environment on the
person or the brain e.g. urban vs nature pictures without sound, smell
and touch (Tilley et al., 2017). The intervention design necessary to
control for all variables will hinder participants’ use of all senses. For
example, this may involve preventing movement to control for activation of motor areas (Vecchiato et al., 2015). However, this review
suggests research has maintained a positive trajectory in design quality
in this regard. Future research must aim, when possible, to continue to
improve on past design to provide a realistic and full picture of an
environments eﬀect on the brain.

outcomes in nature? Are natural environments able to produce stronger
emotional responses and if so, will this change its eﬀects? In contrast,
the strength of the response may play a primary role in the negative
outcome's studies report from over exposure to uncomfortable urban
environments.
A stable ﬁnding across time seems to be alpha activity and associated psychological measures showing relaxation and lower stress, but
less explored is how diﬀerent environments may change the brain and
brain activity over time. If exposure to nature is ‘restorative’, how do
diﬀerent doses of nature protect against resource depleting environments? Research can also explore whether chronic exposure to different, e.g. stressful or restorative, environments will eﬀect change in
brain structure and activity. To our knowledge, only one paper has
looked at lifelong exposure to the natural environment and associated
brain structure. Davand et al. (2018) found more exposure to greenspace was associated with increased grey matter volume in prefrontal
cortices and the left premotor cortex, and increased white matter volume in the right prefrontal cortex, left premotor cortex and both cerebellar hemispheres. Further, they linked this to less inattentiveness
and better working memory. This study suggests extended exposure to
greenspace may eﬀect brain development and associated cognitive
functions. This type of research will provide policy makers, architects
and urban planners with knowledge of the full extent diﬀerent environments have on individuals and if it can have long-term eﬀects on
the brain, mood and behaviour.
There is also scope to measure brain activity associated with less
conscious uncomfortable and comfortable characteristics of an environment. Does the brain respond to these environments before a
person is explicitly aware of being stressed or uncomfortable? Based on
brain activity reported in various temperatures and settings the suggestion is that brain activity will appear before conscious, explicit
knowledge. This provides a method to explore the eﬀect of the environment on human response objectively, using the current knowledge
on neurological response and associated mood states.

4.6. Future directions
Martínez-Soto et al. (2013) found that the natural environment
triggered greater activation in frontal, temporal, and parietal regions
associated with interest, brain stimulation, and emotion contemplation
(e.g. left middle frontal gyrus, insula, cuneus). Although not in direct
contrast with studies reporting lower activation in the frontal region,
this ﬁnding suggests it may be necessary to pinpoint speciﬁc locations,
or networks of locations, to better understand the impact of diﬀerent
environments. Unfortunately, this requires a balance between immobile
and expensive high-resolution imaging equipment (such as MRI/fMRI)
being used to determine speciﬁc activation locations and connectivity;
and mobile, lower quality devices such as EEG and NIRS being used to
explore speciﬁc environments.
A single study found that the subgenual prefrontal cortex, which is
associated with rumination, was less active following a walk in nature
over an indoor walk; the conclusion that nature walks reduce rumination was supported by self-report data (Bratman et al., 2015). Considering the implications rumination has on depressive symptoms
(Joormann & Gotlib, 2008), this ﬁnding warrants further study. Longitudinal study using subjective and objective (brain imaging) rumination and depression scale data is recommended. Exposure to nature
reduces depressive symptoms (e.g. Chawla, 2015; Cohen-Cline,
Turkheimer, & Duncan, 2015) and further study of this type may explore if less rumination following passive nature exposure is a mechanism of this process. Additionally, like the previous suggestion (see
end of section 4.2.), research could explore if meditative practices can
reduce rumination and depressive symptoms when people are in uncomfortable urban environments, perhaps also as a reﬂection of less
subgenual prefrontal cortex activity.
Two studies found increased amygdala activity in urban conditions
but not natural conditions (Kim et al., 2010; Kim & Jeong, 2014). This is
equated to negative emotion, but the amygdala is shown to be over
reactive to strong emotional responses, not just negative ones. Future
work may explore if the lack of amygdala activity in natural environments is due to a weaker emotional response. This stimulates many
further questions. Perhaps, a small dosage of positive emotion is all that
is required to encourage positive outcome's from the natural environment? Perhaps an emotional response is not required at all for positive

5. Conclusion
In cognitive psychology, it has been argued that brain imaging
studies have produced no additional ﬁndings since classic experimental
studies in the 1970s (Sawyer, 2011). Similarly in environmental psychology, Ulrich (1981) found that natural environments promoted EEG
alpha rhythms and relaxed physiological states and this ﬁnding has
been repeated many times since (Bailey et al., 2018; Chang & Chen,
2005; Chiang et al., 2017; Choi et al., 2015) and supported by fMRI and
NIRS studies (Igarashi et al., 2014; Joung et al., 2015; Lee, 2017; Park
et al., 2007, 2016; Song et al., 2017). However, unlike this claim in
cognitive psychology, brain activity measures have broadened our understanding of speciﬁc characteristics of an environment. For example,
it has helped explain the extent speciﬁc attributes of an environment
associate with physiological relaxation. This includes eﬀects of temperature, noise, vegetation density, real vs fake plants and lighting.
Individuals are not always aware of these subtle changes in the environment, but the brain reacts; brain imaging has been an insightful
way to measure these sub-conscious changes in individual's physiological relaxation and help further our understanding of the eﬀect of the
environment on a person.
