Group emotional dynamics are a central concern in the study of human interaction
and communication. To study group emotions, the social context of a musical event
in natural conditions may overcome several limits of laboratory experiments and
could provide a suitable framework. This study aimed to evaluate if cultural events
such as a conductor competition could welcome scientific research for the study
of group emotional sharing. We led an observational study, which suggests that in
this particular context, public, musicians and jury would agree to participate and to
wear neurophysiological and physiological devices to monitor their emotional state
during the competition. Self-administrated scales showed that, in the context of a
musical competition, members of the public felt strong musical emotions such as
music chills. Our results suggest that such a specific competition design is a suitable
experimental model to lead an experiment under ecological conditions to effectively
investigate collective emotional synchronization. In the future, with the implementation
of an acquisition system recording synchronous neurophysiological data for a large
group of participants, we may be able to highlight mechanisms involved in emotional
synchronization in a natural musical setting.

INTRODUCTION
Most people listen to music for its emotional effect (Nieminen et al., 2012) and research has
shown the pleasurable effect of music (Grewe et al., 2007; Salimpoor et al., 2009, 2011). The social
connection with other people and being connected to the performers are the main factors that
motivate people to attend live performances and enjoy them (Burland and Pitts, 2014; Leante, 2016;
Swarbrick et al., 2019). Music is a form of cultural communication (McCormick, 2009). According
to the model of the Share Affective Motion Experience (Molnar-Szakacs et al., 2011), which claims
music as “a series of intentional, expressive motor acts, recruiting similar neural networks in both

Emotional Synchronization in Natural Frameworks

the setting should be stable over time and should include
natural exogenous variations without any interventions from the
experimenters (Meyer, 1995; Craig et al., 2012). The drawback
of such natural conditions is that the selection of participants,
the adherence of subjects with the research, the implementation
of subjective measures, the adaptability of the paradigm to
environmental conditions and so on need to be evaluated
precisely before implementing a study. In this respect, we
hypothesized that the specific context of a conductor competition
would bring an advantageous framework to study the spread
of emotions and emotional synchronization within and between
groups (music performers and listeners) in natural conditions. In
this context, both cerebral activity, in terms of natural activation
of the autonomic nervous system, and subjective feeling could be
recorded among the different participants (orchestra performers,
jury, candidates, and public) during the competition.
In the specific context of the conductors’ competition,
the same orchestra performing the same musical pieces in
the same concert hall in front of the same public offers
favorable live setting conditions. The spread of emotions can
be assessed within and between groups of performers and
listeners. Contrary to laboratory settings, the musical material is
ecological in this context. Direct reports of emotional responses
from participants and neurophysiological recordings should give
objective and subjective measures for the evaluation of groups’
emotional synchronization. In this context, any intervention of
the experimenter would influence the responses. Furthermore,
the natural response of the participants should be controlled at
a physiological level. Music chills can be defined as a strong
transient emotional phenomenon triggered by specific musical
features and involving reactions of the brain and body in the
form of goose bumps and thrills, and which can provoke intense
pleasure (Goldstein, 1980; Salimpoor et al., 2011). Chills present
the advantage of being identified both by physiological measures
and directly reported by the participant (Grewe et al., 2009a,b,
2011). Blood and Zatorre (2001) suggest that pleasantness and
emotional intensity must increase to a certain level before the
occurrence of a chill. Musical chills that are the climax of an
increase in emotion (Grewe et al., 2009a) should be a reliable
indicator of a strong emotional state. They can be generated
in a social situation such as a concert, movie theater, or other
gathering where people are involved in the same action and
focused on the same target (Schoeller, 2015). In that respect,
music chills could indirectly be an indicator of common emotions
between several participants when chills are experienced at the
same time. Using this observational approach should allow
experimenters to record a set of data on different interacting
populations, wherein synchronization can be evaluated in a
natural way, without no intervention required, throughout
the competition.
Volpe et al. (2016) insisted on acquiring large data samples
in valid ecological conditions using multimodal tools to assess
synchronization. Measuring subjective feelings and peripheral
arousal during live concerts provides a great opportunity to
study the influence of other people on emotional responses to
music (Egermann et al., 2013). The new ambulatory monitoring
techniques of physiological recording could highlight numerous

agent and listener” (Overy, 2012: 66), music can enhance
emotions and create a sense of social bonding (Overy, 2012;
Chanda and Levitin, 2013).
Considering research that has investigated the effect of music
listening in groups, some points out that context (laboratory
or natural conditions) and the social environment (being alone
or with other people) could greatly influence the experience
of listening to music (Lamont, 2009; Liljeström et al., 2013).
Being in the context of a concert in the presence of other
people can enhance the listening experience by eliciting at least
a rhythmic synchronization when people move together (Desmet
et al., 2010). Live conditions provide listeners with the strongest
musical experiences (Lamont, 2011), with a greater effect on
physiological variables as heart rate (Shoda et al., 2016). However,
contradictory results have emerged from several studies. On the
one hand, more “pleasure enjoyment” was experienced during
music listening with a close friend or a partner versus alone
(Juslin et al., 2008), and people who listened to music alone
were less likely to experience intense emotions compared to
people listening with a close friend or a partner (Liljeström et al.,
2013). On the other hand, an intra-individual variability has
been demonstrated. Some people were more likely to experience
chills when listening to music alone, whereas others experienced
more when they were with others in daily life situations
(Nusbaum et al., 2013). Furthermore, in a laboratory setting, the
social context negatively affected the emotional experience: the
experience of chills, and thus emotional arousal, was lower in
groups (Egermann et al., 2011). The social context, particularly
in this laboratory setting experiment, influenced participants’
concentration, altering the emotional arousal (Egermann et al.,
2011; Koehler and Broughton, 2017). However, these studies in
laboratory or natural contexts with dyads or groups involved
major differences in implementation.
Ecological conditions may be of great importance when
considering the precise mechanisms of human interactions
(Acquadro et al., 2016). An ecological context should clarify and
help generalize previous laboratory findings (Egermann et al.,
2013), surpassing dyadic interactions (Tarr et al., 2014) and
going beyond some of the experimental laboratory limits in
the study of group emotions. Collective music performances
are a suitable tool through which to study interactions in
ecological conditions (D’Ausilio et al., 2015). Thus, to study
interpersonal synchronization and the mechanisms involved in
social interactions, it is possible to simulate research protocols
that are as realistic as possible whilst maintaining ecological
validity. Ecological experiments in the musical context have
already measured head movement synchronization by simulating
a live concert in a living lab (Swarbrick et al., 2019), or
measured the heart rate of a few people among a large audience
listening to a piano performance in an auditorium (Shoda et al.,
2016). Otherwise, when natural settings are not reproducible in
ecological conditions, it is possible to benefit from the specific
design arising from a natural situation.
By definition natural experiments are studies conducted in
a natural everyday life context seeking to measure variations
in natural processing without the manipulation of variables
(Salkind, 2010). To set up a study in natural conditions,

named data collection sessions according to the day (Monday:
Mon; Tuesday: Tue; Wednesday: Wed) and according to the time
of day: afternoon session [1] or evening session [2]. We collected
data in five sessions: during the 1/8 elimination round (Mon1
and Mon2), the 1/4 final round (Tue1 and Tue2), and the first
semi-final round (Wed1). To identify the candidates engaged in
the competition, letters from A to T were assigned to each of
the 20 conductors.
The 1/8 elimination round took place at the Grand Kursaal
on Monday, 11 September 2017. Ten candidates during the first
session (Mon1) and ten candidates during the second session
(Mon2) conducted the Orchestre Victor Hugo de Besançon
Franche-Comté using three extracts of approximately 10 min
from the musical piece “Appalachian’s Spring Orchestral Suite”
by Aaron Copland. The 1/4 elimination round took place at the
Ledoux Theater on Tuesday, 12 September. Six candidates during
the first session (Tue1) and six candidates during the second
(Tue2) conducted the Orchestre Victor Hugo de Besançon
Franche-Comté using three extracts of approximately 20 min
from “Carmen” by Georges Bizet. The first semi-final round
took place at the Grand Kursaal and included six candidates,
all of whom participated in both sessions. First, they conducted
the Orchestre National de Lyon using two extracts lasting
approximately 25 to 30 min from the ‘Concerto No.2 for Piano
and Orchestra in F minor, Op.21’ by Frédéric Chopin (Soloist:
Philippe Cassard) (Wed1). For further details on the last rounds
of the competition, see Supplementary Data 1.

as yet unknown fundamental mechanisms and datasets related
to information in the field of emotion research, especially in
studies in ecological conditions (Wilhelm and Grossman, 2010;
Shoval et al., 2018). Some musical research has already been
coordinated in both passive and active conditions. A number of
studies have shown the effect of listening to music in terms of the
emotional response using physiological recording, considering
both cardiac and electrodermal activities (Craig, 2005; Grewe
et al., 2011; Mori and Iwanaga, 2014; Colver and El-Alayli, 2016).
Moreover, the development of electroencephalographic (EEG)
hyperscanning methods allows researchers to record EEG data
on several participants simultaneously, providing an appropriate
tool for the study of brain processes involved in social interactions
(Dumas et al., 2010; Acquadro et al., 2016; Toppi et al., 2016;
Balconi and Vanutelli, 2017).
In line with this approach, we led an observational study
that is a first step in the implementation of natural experiments
using neurophysiological sensors in natural conditions. The
overall goal was to assess the appropriateness of using a
conductor competition to study emotional synchronization
within and between groups (music performers and listeners) in
natural conditions. Three dimensions were assessed during this
observational study: the acceptability for listeners (public, jury)
and performers (musicians, conductors) of wearing different
sensors during the competition; the emotional sensitivity of the
public in a such context; and the suitability of competition
settings to replicate an experimental design in natural conditions.

Location

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The final rounds took place in two concert halls in Besançon: the
Grand Kursaal and the Ledoux Theater. The Grand Kursaal is a
480 m2 concert hall containing two balconies and a great stage;
it is able to accommodate approximately 800 people. The Ledoux
Theater is a classic theater composed of a stage and a pit for the
orchestra; it is able to accommodate 1,000 persons on three levels.

Ethics Statement
The research met the local ethical rules provided by French
law on non-invasive protocols involving healthy participants,
and was classified as a psychological observational study outside
the Jardé law (Article R1121-1 of the French Law Code of
Public Health amended by decree n◦ 2017-884 of May 2017).
It was submitted to the Ethics Committee CPP Est II, which
exempted the study from the full ethics review process. Each
participant was informed of the observational nature of the study.
Participants freely filled out questionnaires and gave their implicit
consent by returning the questionnaire. The questionnaires were
anonymous, and no participants can be identified. Participants
who were interviewed gave their explicit oral consent before
answering the investigator’s questions.

Hypothesis and Objectives
We hypothesized that the specific context of this conductor
competition would provide an advantageous framework to
measure the emotional synchronization within and between
groups (music performers and listeners) in natural conditions
using neurophysiological devices.
To test this hypothesis, three requirements must be addressed:
1. Acceptability of further study: Will participants agree to
wear neurophysiological sensors during the competition?
(Feasibility for recruitment).
2. Public’s emotional sensitivity and public profile: Will public
members be sensitive to musical emotions and to music
chills? Will they be representatives of the general public of
classical concert? (External validity).
3. Suitability of competition setting: Will the extracts from
each music piece be performed by each conductor for a
minimal duration of 1 min/30 s? (Reproducibility of similar
conditions) Could some confounding factors (e.g., types
of music piece, orchestra, architecture of the concert hall)
be managed to avoid measurement bias? Will a significant

Presentation of the International
Competition for Young Conductors
The 55th Besançon International Competition for Young
Conductors in France is a musical event based on the musical
direction of various styles and various ensembles (two pianos,
opera, symphonic orchestra, etc.). From the pre-selection to
the final phase, every candidate has to perform the musical
direction of the same musical extracts. Our study concerns only
the final phases. The final rounds of the competition lasted
several days and were composed of two sessions per day, the
first during the afternoon and the second in the evening. We

in the next edition of the competition. The interviews were
conducted individually by TC and LP, mainly during the
intermissions, detailing our aim, the setting for the study and
the different requirements involved in participation. Because
of competition conditions, interviews were conducted directly
in the concert rooms and personal information about age
and gender were not collected during oral interviews. The
only criterion was to be aged over 18 years, with no further
discrimination. The mobile tools presented were EEG wireless
headsets – namely Emotiv Insight, Emotiv Epoc+ and Imec’s
wireless EEG headset – and connected wristbands such as
Jawbone UP3 and Fitbit. Oral interviews were conducted
individually with candidates, musicians and members of the jury
during intermissions. The interviews were conducted with the
musicians and with the conductors during the 1/8 final round
(Mon1, Mon2). They were conducted with members of the public
during the five data collection sessions (Mon1, Mon2, Tue1,
Tue2, and Wed1).

number of conductors produce music chills in the public?
(At least 30% should experience chills).

Study Design
In this observational study, different activities were conducted to
answer our three main requirements.
1. Acceptability for a Further Study
We conducted face to face interviews to assess the
willingness of some public members, jury members,
musicians, and conductors to wear sensors (EEG headsets
and wristbands recording physiological data) during the
conductor competition.
2. Public’s Emotional Sensitivity and Public Profile
We distributed self-reported questionnaires to evaluate
personality profiles and public emotions in the specific
context of the competition, involving a lot of repetitions of
the same short extract of music pieces.
3. Suitability of Competition Setting
We did observations of the competition setting to ensure
the right reproducibility of each candidate’s performance for
further statistical analysis.

Public’s Emotional Sensitivity: A Public Profile
Self-reported questionnaires were used to ascertain the public
profile. Each questionnaire gave only the age and sex of the
responder. Questionnaires were distributed at each entrance to
the concert hall before the performance. Participants freely filled
out and returned the questionnaire at the end of the session.
Many psychology studies have pointed out the positive link
between the personality trait of openness to experience and
sensitivity to aesthetic/music chills (Grewe et al., 2007; McCrae,
2007; Nusbaum and Silvia, 2011a; Silvia and Nusbaum, 2011;
Sumpf et al., 2015; Colver and El-Alayli, 2016). We chose to
assess the emotional sensitivity of responders and their sensitivity
to music chills with a French adaptation of the Aesthetic
Experiences Scale in Music or AES-M (Nusbaum and Silvia,
2011b; Sachs et al., 2016). Finally, we used an adaptation of the
AES-M by candidate (emotional scale by candidate, ESC) to make
comparisons between each candidate and each performance.
Since musical emotional sensitivity could be linked with the
personality profile, we also used the French adaptation of the
Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI), extracted from the Big
Five personality domains (BFI) (Gosling et al., 2003). Using the
personality profile increased the internal validity of our data.
Finally, the classification of the French Orchestra Association
(AFO, Association Française des Orchestres, 2014) was used to
compare public from the conductor competition with public
from classical concert. All these scales are presented in brief below
and in Supplementary Appendices 1–3.

Population
To assess the acceptability of the research protocol, the different
groups were jury members (n = 7), public members (around
300 to 400 per session), musicians (n = 45), and conductors
(n = 20) engaged in the competition. See Table 1 for demographic
information about the participants involved. Interviewees were
selected based on their availability during the breaks (before,
during and after the performance). To test the public’s musical
emotional sensitivity, the only eligibility criterion considered
for the distribution of all questionnaires and for collecting
opinions was to be aged over 18 years. Participation was on a
voluntary basis.

Variables, Data Sources and
Measurement
Acceptability of Further Study
A sample of the four groups (orchestra performers, jury,
candidates, and public) was questioned orally about the
acceptability of both the type of mobile EEG headset and the
tools that could be used in such conditions (three different mobile
devices were presented in pictures), along with whether they
would agree to participate in a similar study about emotions

Ten Item Personality Inventory
The TIPI (see Supplementary Appendix 1) is composed of
ten items, five of which are opposed to the other five.
This allows the researchers to calculate five personality trait
scores: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional
stability, and openness to experience. Each personality trait score
is calculated by averaging the score of one item with the reverse
score of its opposite item on a seven-point Likert scale. The
reverse score corresponds to the reverse rating of the score (for
example, if the score is one, the reverse score will be seven;

if the score is two, the reverse score will be six, etc.). The
item “extraverted, enthusiastic” is opposed to the item “reserved,
quiet,” giving a score for the extraversion personality trait. The
item ‘critical, quarrelsome’ is opposed to the item “sympathetic,
warm,” giving a score for the agreeableness personality trait.
The item “dependable, self-disciplined” is opposed to the item
“disorganized, careless,” giving a score for the conscientiousness
personality trait. The item “anxious, easily upset” is opposed
to the item “calm, emotionally stable,” giving a score for the
emotional stability personality trait. Finally, the item ‘open to
new experiences, complex’ is opposed to the item “conventional,
uncreative,” giving a score for the openness to experience
personality trait.

French Orchestra Association (AFO) Classification
During the semi-final, people were asked to define their auditor
profile by choosing between the profiles extracted from a
classification of the French Orchestra Association (Association
Française des Orchestres, 2014). These categories were “classical
music lover”: first, interested in classical music and then,
sharing a moment in a beautiful place; “curious music lover”:
focused on a musical experience, interested in discovering new
musical works and searching for new emotions aroused by
musical work; “sociable”: concert experience is a pleasurable
moment shared with friends and family in the musical emotion
register; “occasional layman”: infrequent musical and concert
practice, came with family or friend and enjoyed the spectacular
dimension of the event; “distanced amateur”: concerts are an
uncommon opportunity and not a usual practice.

Aesthetic experience scale in music
Based on Nusbaum and Silvia’s previous work (Nusbaum and
Silvia, 2011b) (see Supplementary Appendix 2), four factors
were calculated for the AES-M from ten items: the chill factor, the
touched factor, the absorption factor and the global factor. The
chill factor is composed of the items “Feel chills down your spine,”
“Get goose bumps” and “Feel like your hair is standing on end,”
giving scores out of three. The absorption factor is composed of
the items “Feel absorbed and immersed,” “Completely lose track
of time,” “Feel like you’re somewhere else,” “Feel detached from
your surroundings” and “Feel a sense of awe and wonder,” giving
scores out of five. The touched factor is composed of the items
“Feel touched” and “Feel like crying,” giving scores out of two.
The score for a factor indicates how many items of this factor
had a response greater than or equal to four on a seven-point
Likert scales (corresponding to “sometimes”). The global factor
score out of ten was calculated for each participant by adding the
three factor scores.

Course of the observational study
The schedule of different activities is presented in Table 2.

Suitability of Competition Settings
Finally, direct observations of the concert hall and of the
competition process were performed by noting the timing
of the performance and by analyzing the musical work
to determine whether the competition was adapted to
neurophysiological recordings.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis only covers self-reported questionnaires to
describe the public profile.
A Shapiro–Wilk test was used to check that the data as
a whole followed a normal distribution. Descriptive statistics
were analyzed for the age, gender and size of the sample to
determine the characteristics of the public who responded to the
questionnaires during each session (presented in Table 3). For all
statistical tests, the p-value was fixed with α = 0.05 and analysis
involved a Bonferroni’s correction based on the multiplicity of
the tests. The comparison between sessions for TIPI scores was
analyzed for all participants using analysis of variance (ANOVA)
for extraversion and emotion traits, and a Kruskal–Wallis test for
agreeableness, consciousness and openness to experience traits
(correction of the p-value threshold to p = 0.01).

Emotional scale by candidate
This scale (see Supplementary Appendix 3) tests whether people
can feel different emotions or musical chills according to the
conductor. The scale by candidate is composed of the items
extracted from the AES-M that participants checked off for each
candidate. This allows the researchers to calculate four factors
similar to those of the AES-M. The chill factor gives scores out
of three, the absorption factor gives scores out of five, and the
touched factor gives scores out of two. A global factor score out of
ten was calculated for each participant by adding the three factor
scores. The absence of a response was considered as no feeling for
the item by a candidate.

Emotional Sensitivity According to Candidates
A non-parametric repeated measures ANOVA GLIMMIX
procedure under SAS was applied for each ESC factor for Tue2

greater than or equal to four for 85 participants during
the competition. This suggests that 95.6% of the participants
indicated that they felt “touched” during the competition. In the
same way, 70 participants (78.7%) indicated being “absorbed”
and 29 (32.6%) indicated feeling chills. Finally, the global factor
indicated that there were 26 participants (29.2%) who rated at
least one item of each factor greater than or equal to four.
Regarding the ESC, 77 questionnaires were returned and
76 were analyzed (for the analysis, a letter from A to T was
assigned to each candidate). For the Tue2 session, public reports
showed significant differences between candidates for the global
factor [F(5,190) = 5.13; p < 0.0001; W = 0.12585] and post hoc
analysis revealed differences between candidates S (M = 1.54;
SD = 1.5) vs. L (M = 2.64; SD = 1.8; p < 0.001), I (M = 1.41;
SD = 1.43) vs. L (p < 0.0001) and L vs. P (M = 1.26; SD = 1.33;
p < 0.0001). Candidate L had a higher global factor rating
than the other candidates. For the Tue2 session, there were also
significant differences for the absorption factor [F(5,190) = 3.65;
p < 0.0125; W = 0.07608]. The post hoc analysis revealed
differences between candidates S (M = 1.13; SD = 1.06) vs. L
(M = 2; SD = 1.52; p < 0.01), I (M = 1.33; SD = 1.36) vs. L
(p < 0.001) and L vs. P (M = 1.08; SD = 1.20; p < 0.001). For
more details, see Supplementary Appendix 4. Candidate L had
a higher global factor rating than the other candidates. There
were no significant differences for chill factor between candidates
[F(5,190) = 2.04; p = 0.069; W = 0.06533) or for the touched
factor [F(5,190) = 2.25; p = 0.0464; W = 0.07506]. For Wed1,
there were no significant differences between candidates for any
factor of the AES-M [touched factor F(5,180) = 5,180; p = 0.696;
W = 0.01679; absorption factor F(5,180) = 1.51; p = 0.182;
W = 0.04666; chill factor F(5,180) = 0.70; p = 0.626; W = 0.0288]
or global factor [F(5,180) = 1.41; p = 0.222; W = 0.0486].
Table 4 presents the number of people reporting chills (at least
one item of the chill factor) by candidate for both Tue2 and
Wed1. The phrase “I felt chills for other candidates” indicates
the number of people who also indicated experiencing chills for
other candidates.
During the Tue2 session, 15 participants (38.4%) indicated
feeling chills, and during the Wed1 session, 14 participants
(37.8%) indicated feeling chills. During the whole competition
(Mon1, Mon2, Tue1, Tue2, and Wed1), 58 participants (34.9%)
indicated feeling chills.
Regarding the AFO classification, 32 members of the public
completed the self-reported AFO categories. The results indicate

(random effect), followed by a post hoc contrast analysis with a
p-value correction (p-value threshold: 0.0033). Effect size were
calculated with Kendall coefficient of concordance (W). For the
ESC, a descriptive analysis of the chills felt (indicating the number
of people who reported at least one item of the chill factor) and
the number of people who reported chills for other candidates are

AFO Classification
Chi2 tests were applied to compare the results of the AFO
classification in our study and in the AFO survey. Effect size were
calculated with Cramer’s V.

RESULTS
Acceptability of Further Study
Sixty-nine individuals were questioned orally during the whole
competition. Table 3 shows the sample size of the different
groups (members of the jury, members of the public, members
of the orchestra and conductors engaged in the competition) that
agreed to wear sensors for a future study.
Among the 20 conductors, 13 were interviewed, of whom
eight gave their agreement; one more agreed as long as devices
were worn by all candidates. Among the four conductors
who refused to wear sensors, three of them indicated the
possible discomfort of the EEG headset as they already wear
a microphone, and the fourth cited the distraction the sensor
could cause. All of them agreed to participate in the study if
the research protocol was included in the competition without
wearing sensors. In summary, 91% of people interviewed agreed
to wear sensors to participate in a future study during the
conductor competition.

Public’s Emotional Sensitivity and Public
Profile
Five hundred and eighty one questionnaires were distributed
during five sessions of the competition, of which 166 were
returned, giving a response rate of 28.6%. See Table 1 for details.
Regarding the TIPI scales, 128 questionnaires were returned.
There were no significant differences in sessions for any
items of the TIPI.
Regarding the AES-M, 89 questionnaires were returned.
Descriptive results indicate that the factor “touched” was rated

they conducted two extracts for every session, with at least
one common extract. For the first semi-final round (Wed1),
the candidates had, on average, 23.8 min (SD = 2.7) to
perform. They all conducted the second movement during
this round. Table 5 indicates that, except for candidate
F, they all had approximately 5 min for free rehearsals,
and all rehearsed the second movement with the orchestra.
During all the elimination rounds, a real time video of a
front view of each conductor’s performances was projected
onto a large screen. In this way, the audience and the
jury could follow the gestures, skills and facial expressions
of the candidates.
The segmented part of the competition should enable suitable
monitoring of physiological recordings and an analysis of little
portions of signal. We identified some suitable spaces to prepare
participants, for the positioning of the computers, and for the
monitoring of the recordings. For the theater, recordings on
musicians would be more complex because of the reduced space
in the pit, but was still feasible.

From measure 27 (6)

Would People Agree to Wear the Sensors
During the Competition?
Interestingly, 91% of the interviewees in the different groups
agreed to participate by wearing mobile devices. All the
people from the jury and the musicians that were interviewed
agreed. Only two people from the public were inconsistent
with our approach. This result suggest that our research is
well accepted by the public, jury and musicians. Even though
the organizers of the competition gave their consent and
more than 71% of the interviewed conductors agreed, there
were four conductors that refused to wear sensors during
the competition. For conductors, it might be complicated
to implement neurophysiological recordings in terms of the
management of technical constraints and not disturb their
performance. They may have been afraid of the devices.
Nevertheless, all conductors agreed to participate in a study
if the research protocol was acceptable for all candidates and
was included in the competition rules. However, these results
should be carefully considered: agreements in principle are
more easily given when people are not directly engaged in the
experiment thereafter.

DISCUSSION

Did the Public Experience Emotions
During the Competition?

The results of this study show the suitability of using a conductor
competition as a testbed to study emotional synchronization
within and between groups (music performers and listeners) in
a natural setting. The conductor competition provides a natural
experimental design: during a session, the same orchestra plays
the same extract many times in the same place in front of the
same public. Thus, every conductor conveyed a different musical
interpretation and different emotional content in a randomized
running order that constituted natural variation.

Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org

Rehearsal work of the 2nd movement (mins)

More than 95% of the participants indicated feeling touched
during the competition, according to AES-M questionnaires.
Our analysis of the general emotions reveals that a sufficient
proportion of the public (29.2%) were able to feel emotions
during the first few sessions of the competition. These results also
confirm that in the particular context of the competition, even if
the musical pieces are repeated and performed with completely

7

Chabin et al.

Emotional Synchronization in Natural Frameworks

different interpretations than the public’s expectations, people
can feel emotions. Furthermore, a high percentage of respondents
(34.9%) reported feeling chills during the competition. This result
strengthens the validity of our approach to the investigation
of strong musical emotions. Our evaluation of the public’s
emotional sensitivity was positive for the first sessions, so we
used the ESC on Tue2 and Wed1 to make deeper comparisons
between each candidate and each performance. We used the
ESC especially when the number of candidates was reduced to
six and thus comparisons were easier to make. We confirmed
that some candidates conveyed greater emotions to the public
than other candidates. In a future natural experiment, conductors
conveying greater emotions should also elicit greater emotional
synchronization between the musicians and the audience. Less
emotional performances could be used as control. During a
single performance, some candidates succeeded in triggering
chills in almost a quarter of our respondent sample. This
suggests that future experiments in natural conditions might
highlight an emotional synchronization between participants
during a conductor’s performance. In sum, our public was
sensitive to musical emotion in the natural context of the
competition. Furthermore, people that are not sensitive to
musical emotions should be a necessary control group for
the measurement of emotional synchronization in the future
natural experiment.
Music chills area well-established marker of musical emotional
peaks and a quite large majority of humans should be sensitive
to music chills – as high as 86%, according to Panksepp
(1995) – while some (anhedonics) are not. Music chills do
not occur systematically, and many factors are implicated
(personality profile, conditions of listening, musical pieces,
social atmosphere, temperature of the room, and so on). Our
study shows that music chills occurred in a third of the
listeners that completed the self-reports under the specific
conditions of the contest. The importance of this rate is certainly
debatable, but the sample of respondents was not selected
on their predisposition to feel chills. This criterion should
probably be introduced in a subsequent research study. The
current observation simply shows that chills occurred quite
frequently despite the conditions of the conductor competition,
with short musical excerpts and frequent interruptions of the
orchestra. Considering the future naturalistic experiment, this
result indicates that an adequate sample can be selected from the
public at the competition.

engaged in the competition as jury members or musicians,
we can hypothesize that members of the public would be
cognitively unfettered and thus more able to concentrate
on their emotional state for the continuous reporting. With
their stationary position allowing for easy control of technical
constraints, the public appear to be most able to endure
neurophysiological recording. Our population was homogeneous
between the sessions: in the different sessions, no significant
differences were highlighted for the rating of each item of
the TIPI. Since personality profiles are similar between each
session, neurophysiological recordings could be implemented in
all phases of the competition. This is a strong argument for the
feasibility of a future study.
The natural environment lets the public have the flow of
natural auditory and visual information matching with the
context (Williamon et al., 2014). Moreover, the issue of a
conductor or a music competition, impossible to reproduce
in simulated contexts, reinforces the immersive experiment
and keeps motivation and attention throughout the sessions.
This context allows the public to judge every performance.
Considering the musical material, the stimuli are ecological
and not simulated. To broadcast repeated stimuli many times
for neurophysiological recordings in a laboratory experiment
is inappropriate. Furthermore, in the condition of a classical
concert, classical orchestras’ rehearsals are impossible to
reproduce, while numerous repetitions are necessary to make
comparisons and thus obtain neurophysiological data with a
valid statistical analysis. A conductor or a music competition
overcomes this difficulty. A stationary instrumental ensemble,
in particular a classical one, performing the same musical score
several times in the same conditions limits the uncertainty
and limits the influence of different natural variables on the
neurophysiological data collection. This specific design sets
a fixed frame with natural control of musical stimuli in
natural conditions. This is essential in studies using music
and EEG, since the different features of music (pitch, tone,
beat, rhythm) can influence brainwaves in a different way.
The conductors will influence the whole orchestra in different
ways, conveying different emotional interpretations of musical
pieces and producing the aesthetic quality of the ensemble
(Boerner and von Streit, 2007). Finally, the participants’
responses are a reliable indicator of emotion that needs to be
recorded. The natural feedback of participants should not be
influenced by any element of the experiment other than the
performance itself.

Could Competition Settings Facilitate
Experiments?

Limitations
Some biases might be implied. Some members of the public
might not have fully understood all the terms of the TIPI scale.
This kind of questionnaire is most often used in a general
context, so our case study context was not totally appropriate.
Moreover, though our response rate was reasonable, the sample
size remains too small to draw comprehensive conclusions.
Our population is slightly different from the general public for
classical music performance: in the context of the competition,
our sample has significantly more “curious music lovers” and
fewer “sociable” respondents than the AFO public survey. These

Considering the competition setting, our observations of
the concert halls’ characteristics show that neurophysiological
recording can be set up in these natural conditions. During all
the sessions, each candidate conducted at least one common
extract over a sufficient time period and had at least 20 min of
rehearsal (except for one candidate). It would allow statistical
comparisons of future neurophysiological data to be made.
Thus, neurophysiological recordings could be set up to give
enough time to obtain comparable data. As they are not directly

Emotional Synchronization in Natural Frameworks

musicians’ neurophysiological recordings have to be tested
and managed before the competition to ensure good signal
and minimal noise.
In a future natural experiment, we aim to recruit regulars
and people interested primarily in the competition and not in
the scientific study. This experiment in natural conditions may
highlight as yet unknown cerebral and physiological mechanisms
between an active group of musicians and a passive public.
We suggest that good synchronization between musicians might
have an influence on public emotions. The higher the emotional
synchronization in the musician’s group, the more public
members should be synchronized. Such a hypothesis will be
assessed by objective and subjective measures.

characteristics limit the external validity of our results. However
the “curious music lovers,” defined as particularly interested
in the music offered in the context and searching for new
musical works, experiences and emotions, are of particular
interest in relation to our emotional approach. Furthermore,
as mentioned, some people should not have the same opinion
about our approach if that implicate to be directly engaged
in the competition instead of giving a simple agreement in
principle. Because of the competition timing, we could not gather
the opinions of all respondents regarding the wearable devices:
this meant we were unable to correlate the agreement of the
participants and scales. Finally, since one aim of the study was
to evaluate the feasibility of neurophysiological recordings in
natural conditions, we did not record audio and video motion
that would be appropriate for study of the orchestra and public
(Swarbrick et al., 2019). Audio and video motion, combined with
neurophysiological recordings, could offer a unique approach in
the understanding of emotional synchronization and should be
included in future research.

CONCLUSION
These results confirm that this specific conductor competition
is a suitable model to investigate collective emotions in
natural conditions using neurophysiological devices. Almost
all of the people interviewed agreed in principle to wear
a sensor; the competition’s emotional content is appropriate
for the study of collective emotions; and the settings of
the competition fit our neurophysiological approach. The
competition design is similar to a natural standard experimental
design. Thus, the conductors conveying different emotional
performances constitute the intervention, with a randomized
running order. Particular attention must be paid to participants’
musical emotional sensitivity. This competition context –
particularly an audience gathering in a concert hall – may
highlight a number of undiscovered mechanisms involved in
emotional synchronization.

Perspectives
These results are part of a larger work investigating emotional
synchronization in groups in a natural framework. Our
project gathers many facets of non-verbal human interactions
(emotional, physical, aesthetic and sensorimotor) and several
kinds of interaction in terms of directional categorization:
observation condition, turn-based interaction and continuous
interaction (Acquadro et al., 2016) in a particular context.
Including both the audience and the musicians in a
multidirectional interaction increases the ecological validity;
unfortunately, though, it also increases the uncertainty of
the ongoing measures (D’Ausilio et al., 2015). However,
the recording of EEG hyperscanning and physiological data
synchronized with the direct behavioral response of multiple
participants on a smartphone through different groups will be a
huge source of inter-related data, giving complex and precious
information about human interactions in passive and active
musical contexts. Some studies using EEG hyperscanning have
investigated the synchronization between musicians playing
in groups (Babiloni et al., 2006; Lindenberger et al., 2009;
Müller et al., 2012, 2013). The technological progress provided
by recently developed portable EEG equipment combined
with increasingly powerful artifact detection methods (Stone
et al., 2018) facilitates realistic experiments, especially those
studying several musicians simultaneously (Babiloni et al.,
2011, 2012; Müller et al., 2012, 2013, 2018). As previously
emphasized, classical musicians performing a musical score
in a relatively stationary position allows researchers to record
EEG data with a high signal-to-noise ratio (Babiloni et al.,
2011; D’Ausilio et al., 2015), as well as a good physiological
recording. However, though a few studies have recorded
EEG and physiological data during musical performances
(Babiloni et al., 2011; Ichihashi et al., 2012; Müller et al.,
2012, 2013, 2018), one of the main experimental limits is still
the control of motor execution, greatly disrupting the signal.
Musicians are often instructed to limit their musical execution
movements as much as possible. Considering this difficulty,
