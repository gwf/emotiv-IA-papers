signal obtained in the pre-frontal region (AF3, F7, F3, F4, F8,
and AF4), temporal cortex (T7, T8), and association area of
the motor cortex (FC5, FC6) using an EPOC device when a
human makes a voluntary movement of the right and left
knee. In a recent study, the mechanism of voluntary
movement was confirmed using fMRI (functional MRI) [3].
Nonetheless, the mechanism of voluntary movement was not
confirmed using EEG in that study [3]. Therefore, we studied
the mechanism of voluntary movement using both fMRI and
EEG. Then, using ICA, we recovered independent sources
using only sensor observations that are linear mixtures of
independent source signals [4]–[8] after detecting an EEG
signal. Finally, we detected the signal that has a peak value,
either positive or negative, using a median morphological
filter [9], [10]. On the basis of the signals detected using ICA
and the median morphological filter, we scanned activities of
the prefrontal and temporal cortex related the decision
making [11], [12] and activities of the association area of the
motor cortex related to voluntary movement. In addition, we
obtained activities of the frontal cortex that are related to
decision making and voluntary movement for imaging,
information
processing,
and
verifying
stored
informationbased on the results of the experiment with a
voluntary movement of the right or left knee. These results
suggest that we could confirm the mechanism of voluntary
movement using EEG similar to that using fMRI. These data
indicate that we could develop a novel rehabilitation
assistance system, serving the same purpose as the following
systems: hybrid assistive limb (HAL) developed by
Cyberdyne Inc. [13], and the wearable power-assist
locomotor (WPAL) built by Aska Corporation [14]. The new
system could use EEG analysis on a daily basis.

Abstract—This paper proposes an electroencephalogram
(EEG)-based method for identifying the mechanism underlying
brain activity during a voluntary movement. Our final goal is to
develop a rehabilitation assistance system that can be used on a
daily basis by observing a patient’s degree of functional
recovery. In order to assist in ambulation rehabilitation, the
mechanism related to the voluntary movement need to be
identified. As a first step, we elucidated the mechanism
underlying brain activity. The proposed method involves EEG
recording, blind source separation, noise reduction, and feature
enhancement. The EEG device has dry-type sensors.
Independent component analysis is used to delink the signal.
Median morphological filters are used to reduce EEG noise and
emphasize the feature signal. To demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method, we conducted experiments using real
EEG data.

I. INTRODUCTION
In this paper, we propose an electroencephalogram
(EEG)-based method for detecting the trigger pattern of a
walking motion. It is difficult to develop robot-assisted
walking devices for the elderly and people with hemiparesis.
Our final goal is to develop a rehabilitation assistance system
that can assist in ambulation exercise and be used on a daily
basis for monitoring of a patient’s degree of functional
recovery. In order to assist in ambulation rehabilitation, the
method needs to detect the feature signal related to the
voluntary walking in the EEG. The techniques that target
various EEG features exist for analyzing EEG signals [1],
such as power spectrum, spectral centroid, event-related
potential (ERP), and principal component analysis (PCA) as
well as factor analysis, independent component analysis
(ICA), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), linear discriminant
analysis (LDA), neural network analysis (NN), and support
vector machine (SVM) classification. We focused on a
combination of feature extraction techniques for real-time
processing because our final goal is to develop a system that
can be used on a daily basis. As a first step, we detected an
EEG feature signal that has the potential to become the
starting point of a walking motion using SVM after
morphological filtering [2]. Therefore, we detected an EEG

II. PROPOSED METHODS
The method involves EEG recording, blind source
separation, noise reduction, and feature enhancement.
A. EEG Recording
In EEG recording, we used the EPOC device, which was
developed by EMOTIV, to measure EEG activity. The EPOC
uses a dry-type sensor and covers 10ch electrodes. The two
reference electrodes are attached to the bone just behind each
ear lobe and the exploring electrodes are attached to AF3,
AF4, F7, F8, F3, F4, T7, T8, FC5, and FC6 in the
international 10-10 system (Fig. 1) because activities of the
prefrontal and temporal cortex include potentials related to
decision making [11], [12]. In addition, activities of the
association area of the motor cortex contain potentials related
to regulation of motion. Moreover, this device has high
resolution, neuro-signal acquisition, and a processing
wireless neuro-headset. During EEG feature extraction, the

unitary transformation [5]. Here, an evaluation function such
as the index of independence is necessary when blind signal
separation is calculated as the optimal return matrix. As the
evaluation function, we used the Kullback–Leibler (KL)
divergence:

C. Noise Reduction and Feature Enhancement
Median morphological filters with edge enhancement and
smoothing properties were used to reduce EEG noise and
emphasize the feature signal. The morphological filters use
Minkowski addition and subtractionbased on a morphological
operation and are defined by the following formulae:

(1)

𝑓

1) Whiting of the observed signal
The convergence of independent components is a suitable
stage for whitening of the observed signal.This is because
whitening allows for inclusion of uncorrelated and
independent components. This process builds the whitening
matrix so that the vector of the observed signal is
uncorrelated with the variance–covariance matrix of the
observed signal [5]. The whitening matrix is determined as
the eigenvectors used by the variance–covariance matrix of
the normalized data of the observed signal. Here the
variance–covariance matrix is a matrix showing the
magnitude of the deviation degree of the average value [6] as
follows:
𝑛−1

𝑇

𝜕 log 𝑝 𝑦1
𝜕𝑦1

The convergence point of W integrates the separation
matrix formulation and reproduces the independent signal
when measuring the RAWsignal by applying W to the
observed signal [5], [8]. In that case, we arrived at a
rectangular matrix starting from the square matrix using
singular value decomposition. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 show the
properties and frequency characteristics, respectively, of
ICA.

After solving this equation, we performed the blind signal
separation and whitening of the observed signal.

B. Blind Source Separation
The goal of blind source separation (BSS) is to recover
independent sources using only sensor observations that are
linear mixtures of independent source signals. The term blind
indicates that both the source signals and the way the signals
were mixed are unknown. ICA is a method for solving the
blind source separation problem and identifies a linear
coordinate system such that the resulting signals are as
statistically independent from each other as possible [4]. Here,
ICA is defined by the following formula:

calculatedas eigenvectors from these formulae using the
Jacobi method [7].
2) Blind signal separation
At this point, there is no independence and the arbitrary
property of rotation remains in the state resulting from
whitening of the observed signal. Therefore, blind signal
separation is determined as the optimal return matrix using

From the recording during the voluntary movement of the
right knee, we scanned activity of the prefrontal cortex (AF3
and AF4) at the beginning, based on the results presented in
Fig. 7 and Fig. 9. Then, we assessed activity of the temporal
cortex (T7 and T8). These results suggest that we could
confirm the activity of decision making from the prefrontal
and temporal cortex when a subject heard a sound signal. We
scanned activity of the right frontal cortex (F8 and F4). It was
possible to identify the activity related to the EEG pattern
when the subject made the voluntary movement of the right
knee [15]. Then, we assessed activity of the left frontal cortex
(F7 and F3). We could confirm the activity related to decision
making and voluntary movement from the left frontal cortex
before the subject moved the right foot up and down. Finally,
we scanned activities of the association area of the motor
cortex (FC5 and FC6). The result indicates that we could
confirm the activity related to the voluntary movement from
the association area of the motor cortex before the subject
moved the right foot up and down. However, in the results of
voluntary movement of the left knee, we assessed activity of
the left prefrontal region (AF3, F7, and F3) at the beginning,
based on the results shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 10.

data if 𝑓(𝑡)> 0. Closing was applied if 𝑓(𝑡)< 0 [10]. Fig. 4

For each set, EEG data were recorded for 10 s with no motion
and 4 s during voluntary movements. The motion pattern was

We could confirm the activity related to the information
processing and verification of stored information from the
left prefrontal region when the subject heard the sound
signal.We scanned activity of the right prefrontal cortex
(AF4) and assessed activity of the temporal cortex (T7 and

T8). These results suggest that we could confirm the activity
of decision making from the right prefrontal and temporal
cortex after the activity related to the information processing
and verification of stored information [15]. Then, we scanned
activity of the right frontal cortex (F8 and F4). We could

activity of the frontal cortex without the voluntary movement
of the right or left foot. In addition, the correlation coefficient
between the voluntary movement and the absence thereof in
the frontal cortex activity was approximately 0.6 (Fig. 13).
These results indicate that we could confirm the frontal
cortex activities related to the movement of the right foot up
and down as well as the information processing and
verification of stored information during the movement of the
left foot up and down.
Nevertheless, the results differed among the subjects. Fig.
14 presents the data on the mechanism underlying brain
activity when each subject made the voluntary movement.
We obtained analogous data on the activity of the prefrontal
cortex (AF3 and AF4; Fig. 14). The right-handed subjects
showed switching of activity from AF4 to AF3 during a
voluntary movement of the right knee, and switching from
AF3 to AF4 during a voluntary movement of the left knee.
On the other hand, the left-handed subjectshowed the activity

confirm the activity related the decision making and
voluntary movement from the right frontal cortex before the
subject moved the left foot up and down. Finally, we
determined activities of the association area of the motor
cortex (FC5 and FC6). We could confirm the activity related
the voluntary movement from the association area of the
motor cortex before the subject moved the left foot up and
down. These data show that identifying a mechanism of
voluntary movement using EEG could become as effective as
the fMRI-based method.
Next, we conducted the experiment with a voluntary
movement of the right or left knee because we had to confirm
the frontal cortex (F7, F3, F4, and F8) activities related to the
movement of the right foot up and down as well as the
information processing and verification of stored information
during the movement of the left foot up and down,
respectively. Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 show the results of the
experiment with the voluntary movement of the right or left
knee. According to these results, we could confirm the unique

These results suggest that it is possible to obtain similar
results when we compare right-handed and left-handed
subjects. Moreover, we obtained similar data on activity of
the temporal cortex (T7 and T8). The temporal cortex shows
brain activity of decision making at this very instant.
Furthermore, the subjects exhibited switching from FC6 to
FC5 (the association area of the motor cortex) during the
voluntary movement of the right knee and switching from
FC5 to FC6 during the voluntary movement of the left knee.
It appears that the association area of the motor cortex
conducts information processing from side to side as an
activity related to voluntary movements. In addition, we
observed changes of activity in the frontal cortex (F7, F8, F3,
and F4) in each subject. During a voluntary movement of the
right knee, activity of the frontal cortex was registering
between the temporal cortex (T7, T8) and the association area
of the motor cortex (FC5, FC6). Thus, it is possible to
distinguish the activity related to decision making and
voluntary movement (F7, F3) and the brain activity when the
subject made a voluntary movement of the right knee (F8, F4)
[15] in each of our subjects. On the other hand, in the data on
the voluntary movement of the left knee, activity of the
frontal cortex was registering between the temporal cortex
(T7, T8) and the association area of the motor cortex (FC5,

FC6) in the left-handed subject. Thus, it is possible to
distinguish the activity related to decision making and
voluntary movement (F8, F4) and the information processing
and verification of stored information (F7, F3) [13] in each
subject. However,activity of the left frontal cortex (F7, F3)
was registering between the left prefrontal cortex (AF3) and
the right prefrontal cortex (AF4) in the right-handed subject.
It appears that activity of the left frontal region (AF3, F7, and
F3) was registering before the activity of decision making.
More than 90% of the brain-related language is located in the
left brain of right-handed people [16]. In contrast, 60% of the
brain-related language is located in the left brain and 40% in
the right brain of left-handed people [16]. These results
indicate that it is possible for the left prefrontal region to
evolve in a right-handed person. Accordingly, the left frontal
region activity registered before the decision making activity.
We conducted quantitative evaluation to confirm the above
conclusions. We applied the rule of quantitative evaluation as
shown in Fig. 14 and Fig. 15. In addition, we used SVM for
EEG pattern classification. SVM classifies the EEG patterns
that indicate the presence or absence of a voluntary
movement of the right or left foot (up and down).This study
employs a linear discriminant function y = f(x),which
identifies two classes of the variable x, for hyperplane as

where 𝑎 and 𝑏 are slope and intercept, respectively. The
criteria for determining the identified classes of hyperplane
data establish the maximized margins. Here, a margin is the
Euclidean distance between the plane of identification and
the training data. We identified the peak data either positive
or negative and used nonpeak data of either positive or
negative maximal margin classifier [17], [18]. The values of
the sliding overlap and window are 1 and 30, respectively, for
classifying the EEG patterns. The number of detection
patterns and test data patterns is 28 and 6160, respectively. In
addition, this paper detects the real mechanism obtained peak

because the subject became familiar with the process of
moving the right or left foot up and then down.
Similarly, the detection ratio during the voluntary
movement of the left knee was not due to the prefrontal
cortex peak’s being late or the left frontal cortex peak
showing a change. It appears that the activity of decision
making became sluggish, the activity related to the decision
making and voluntary movement (F7, F3) and the EEG
pattern when the subject made the voluntary movement of the
right knee (F7, F4) [15] were changed in the left-handed
subject. The activity of decision making (AF3, AF4) and the
EEG pattern when the subject made the voluntary movement
of the right knee (F7, F4) [15] were changed in the
right-handed subject because the subject became familiar
with the process of moving the right or left foot up and then
down. Moreover, the false detection ratio was 0.0206 during
the voluntary movement of the right knee and 0.0201 during
the voluntary movement of the left knee (Table I). These
results show that the EEG pattern during the movement of the
right or left foot up and then down bears resemblance to the
peak of voluntary movement. In addition, there is some
analogy between the signals of the peak of voluntary
movement and the signals corresponding to no movement.
The detection ratio was 0.714 during the voluntary
movement of the right knee and 0.728 during the voluntary
movement of the left knee (Table II). The detection
ratioduring the voluntary movement of the right knee and the
voluntary movement of left knee were not due to the
prefrontal cortex peak being late or the quantitative
evaluation in each subject. It appears that the subjects became
familiar with the process of moving the right or left foot up
and then down. In addition, the false detection ratio was
0.019 during the voluntary movement of the right knee and
0.019 during the voluntary movement of the left knee (Table
II). These results indicate that the EEG pattern during the
movement of the right or left foot up and down bears
resemblance to the peak of voluntary movement. Similarly,
there is some analogy between the signals of the peak of
voluntary movement and the signals corresponding to no
movement. If we compare the results of Tables I and II, the
difference in the detection ratio was 0.004 during the
voluntary movement of the left knee. The quantitative
evaluation in all subjects appears to be successful at detecting
the pattern of AF3 > AF4 because the right-handed subjects
showed activity in the left prefrontal region (AF3, F7, and
F3) before the activity of the right prefrontal cortex (AF4).
All these results suggest that we could confirm the activity
of decision making and that related to voluntary movement
from the activities of the prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex,

ratio during the voluntary movement of the right knee was
not due to the prefrontal cortex peak being late or the right

activity of decision making became sluggish, and the activity
related to the decision making and voluntary movement (F7,

and association area of the motor cortex in all subjects.
Accordingly, we may be able to develop a rehabilitation
assistance system that works on a daily basis and utilizes
EEG analysis. Nevertheless, the peak of the prefrontal cortex
was registering late because the subjects became familiar
with the process of moving the right or left foot up and then
down. We believe that the EEG pattern of the frontal region
was changed because this brain region did not activate itself
for the integration of the processing when humans voluntarily
move the right or left knee [19] during the latter half of our
experiment.In future, we aim to develop a method to turn on
the activity of the frontal region in a sustainable manner.

V. CONCLUSION
As a first step in the development of a rehabilitation
assistance system based on EEG analysis, we elucidated the
mechanism underlying brain activity when each subject made
a voluntary movement. The new system may assist in
ambulation rehabilitation using EEG data from the prefrontal
cortex, temporal cortex, and association area of the motor
cortex. We could confirm the EEG activity related to decision
making and the activity related to a voluntary movement of
the right or left foot up. ICA can be used for the blind source
separation in EEG, and the median morphological filter can
be used for noise reduction in EEG during the movement of
the right or left foot up. Future work should lead to the
development of the rehabilitation assistance system that
works on a daily basis and uses EEG analysis. Therefore, we
should be able to find a way to activate the frontal region in a
sustainable manner, improve the detection ratio, reduce false
detection, and create a real-time measuring and processing
program.
