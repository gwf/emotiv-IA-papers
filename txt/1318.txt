Abstract
Background: Central Neuropathic Pain (CNP) is a frequent chronic condition in people with spinal cord injury (SCI).
Previously, we showed that using laboratory brain-computer interface (BCI) technology for neurofeedback (NFB)
training, it was possible to reduce CNP in people with SCI. In this study, we show results of patient self-managed
treatment in their homes with a BCI-NFB using a consumer EEG device.
Methods: Users: People with chronic SCI (17 M, 3 F, 50.6 ± 14.1 years old), and CNP ≥4 on a Visual Numerical Scale.
Location: Laboratory training (up to 4 sessions) followed by home self-managed NFB. User Activity: Upregulating the
EEG alpha band power by 10% above a threshold and at the same time downregulating the theta and upper beta
(20-30 Hz) band power by 10% at electrode location C4. Technology: A consumer grade multichannel EEG headset
(Epoch, Emotiv, USA), a tablet computer and custom made NFB software. Evaluation: EEG analysis, before and after
NFB assessment, interviews and questionnaires.
Results: Effectiveness: Out of 20 initially assessed participants, 15 took part in the study. Participants used the system
for 6.9 ± 5.5 (median 4) weeks. Twelve participants regulated their brainwaves in a frequency specific manner and
were most successful upregulating the alpha band power. However they typically upregulated power around their
individual alpha peak (7.6 ± 0.8 Hz) that was lower than in people without CNP. The reduction in pain experienced
was statistically significant in 12 and clinically significant (greater than 30%) in 8 participants. Efficiency: The donning
was between 5 and 15 min, and approximately 10–20% of EEG data recorded in the home environment was noise.
Participants were mildly stressed when self-administering NFB at home (2.4 on a scale 1–10). User satisfaction: Nine
participants who completed the final assessment reported a high level of satisfaction (QUESQ, 4.5 ± 0.8), naming
effectiveness, ease of use and comfort as main priorities. The main factors influencing frequency of NFB training
were: health related issues, free time and pain intensity.
Conclusion: Portable NFB is a feasible solution for home-based self-managed treatment of CNP. Compared to
pharmacological treatments, NFB has less side effects and provides users with active control over pain.

Background
Primary consequences of Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) include
loss or impairment of sensation and voluntary control of
muscles. A related secondary consequence of the injury is
chronic neuropathic pain. It is believed that neuropathic
pain below the level of injury has a central origin, and is
therefore also referred to as Central Neuropathic Pain
(CNP) [1]. In 40% of SCI patients, pain is severe, persistently interfering with the activities of daily living [2, 3]. As a
consequence of this, patient’s sleep quality is reduced associated with high levels of anxiety and depression [4]. A
combination of low self-efficacy and pain intensity has been
associated with reduced quality of life in people with SCI
[5]. The CNP following spinal cord injury not only affects
patients’ health status and quality of life but also has an
economic impact on the patient and the wider society [4].
Patients with CNP perceive pain as coming from the
part of body affected by the injury, but the origin of the
pain is actually in the central nervous system. Magnetic
resonance imaging studies revealed changes in brain anatomy due to CNP [6]. The activity of the sensory-motor
cortex is in particular affected by this type of pain [7].
Several studies defined electroencephalographic (EEG)
markers of CNP, such as: reduction of alpha band power
and shift of dominant alpha frequency towards lower
frequencies, increased theta and beta band power due to
thalamo-cortical dysrhythmia, and a reduced ratio between EEG eyes open and eyes closed states [8–11]. Recently, our group identified asymptomatic EEG markers
preceding the physical sensation of CNP in people with
subacute SCI [12]. Changes in EEG activity may precede
the onset of pain, and to some extent may cause pain.
CNP symptoms do not respond well to medications.
Drugs used to treat this type of pain are often associated
with significant adverse side effects and complete pain relief is rare [13, 14]. A Cochrane study analysis showed that
neuromodulatory interventions, which modify brain processes underlying the experience of pain have the potential
to relieve pain [15]. These interventions may be used either to complement or to replace pharmacological treatments. The most studied noninvasive neuromodulatory
treatments of CNP are repetitive transcranial magnetic
stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) [15]. Both techniques require external electrical or magnetic stimulation of the cortex.
Neurofeedback (NFB) is a neuromodulatory treatment,
it enables people to modulate their brain activity at will.
It relies on BCI technology, which enables analysis and
visualization of EEG signals in real time [16]. Neurofeedback has been used for the treatment of various conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
epilepsy, migraine, depression, to name a few [16, 17].
Neurofeedback has also been used for the treatment of
chronic pain, such as complex regional pain syndrome

Page 2 of 24

[18], fibromyalgia [19], migraine [20] and our group
demonstrated its effectivness for treating CNP in people
with SCI in controlled clinical conditions [21, 22].
Results from the literature suggest that NFB tunes
brain oscillation towards a homeostatic set-point which
affords an optimal balance between network flexibility
and stability [23]. This hypothesis is relevant in light of
CNP, which is considered a consequence of disturbed
homeostasis of the sensory system, in particular its thermal pathways [24, 25].
A particularly appealing aspect of NFB, compared to
other neuromodulatory treatments which require technology (rTMS, tDCS [15]), is that it does not require an external stimulus apart from visual feedback. It enables
patients to actively take part in the treatment, by shifting
the locus of control from external to internal [26]. A participant in our previous study commented that “Previously
pain controlled my life, now I’m in control of pain” [27].
This aspect of NFB is of particular importance in the SCI
population, who, due to physical disability, are constantly
struggling to get control over their own lives [28].
We performed our previous study [21], in a laboratory
within a spinal injuries centre, we used laboratory EEG
equipment with a cap, gel, wires and costly licensed software. Patients often had to travel an hour or more to
hospital causing fatigue, which was counterproductive to
NFB. A quote from one of the participants nicely summaries patient requirements: “If a handheld or portable
device could be made which you could switch on and do
the same things that we’ve been doing in the hospital
here, then that would be a big advance” [27].
Results of BCI usability home based studies from the
literature [29–31] indicate that home based systems operated by non-experts in uncontrolled conditions must
be effective, have a tele-monitoring system, easy to use,
portable and be inexpensive. A key point of usability is
that users can employ a particular technology with relative ease according to the specific context of use. This
ensures that the device not only does its intended purpose but also that it fits around users’ lifestyles. Such devices can only be tested in the home rather than a
laboratory environment. This approach should minimise
the ‘burden of treatment’ [32] which is a frequent reason
for abandonment of much wider used technology such
as splints, walkers or scooters [33] .
Brain computer interface usability studies with patients
have been tested on several paradigms, including BCI
spellers, painting, gaming, environmental control (smart
homes) and cognitive rehabilitation [30, 31, 34–43].
However, a very small number of these studies [30, 37,
40] have been performed in patients’ homes, and a
trained specialist was often present. A “Back home” project, one of the largest of this kind, tested BCI designed
for spelling, gaming and internet browsing on 9 patients

Al-Taleb et al. Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation

(2019) 16:128

at a hospital. They rated speed, ease of use, effectiveness,
reliability and comfort as the most important properties
of BCI [29].
In a subsequent study, Miralles et al. [30] tested the
“Back home” system on a number of patients at hospital
but only two patients managed to use the device in their
homes for 6 weeks. Daly’s et al. [34] usability study of
BCI for cognitive rehabilitation of people with traumatic
brain injury initially involved 10 participants but only 5
completed all three sessions. These studies demonstrate
challenges of organising studies outside the controlled
laboratory or clinical environments.
BCI user-centred design has four stages [44]: understand
and specify the context of use, specify the user requirements, produce design solutions and evaluate design
against requirements. In this study, we present the last
two stages, design solution and end user evaluation. Our
proposed design solution is a wearable inexpensive version
of BCI NFB. Previously we tested reliability of the BCI
NFB presented here in a single session on 18 able-bodied
people [45] but we did not test the effect of NFB on pain
and participant’s ability to self-manage BCI equipment.
Recently, Rhiu et al. [46] proposed a BCI usability
framework that is an adapted version of a usability
framework for consumer audio-visual technology [47].
In this study we adopted Rhiu’s framework to test the
usability of patient self-managed BCI NFB treatment of
CNP using wireless consumer BCI technology. People
with SCI affected by CNP range in impairments from
those with mild walking difficulty to complete tetraplegia, such people are unable to use their hands and
rely on their caregivers for activities of everyday living
[2, 3]. This provided the opportunity to test the usability
of the system on people with different abilities, within
the same BCI NFB paradigm.

Fig. 1 Usability framework (Rhui et al. 2018)

Page 3 of 24

The aim of this study is to present a portable BCI NFB
solution and to test the usability of the system for home
based, self-managed treatment of CNP in people with SCI.

Materials and methods
The usability framework [46] consists of 6 components divided into 4 groups, (i) User, (ii) User activity, comprising
Task and the Environment, (iii) Technology and (iv) Evaluation, comprising Methods and Measures (Fig. 1). The
framework has been recently published, and the examples
in [46] were based on previously published papers, which
did not follow the framework from the outset. In order to
implement the framework, we further subdivided these 6
generic components to suit to the particular study design.
Users

We expanded component “Users” into three categories:
user impairment, user demographics and user experience.
User impairment

Twenty people with SCI (17 male and 3 female, age
50.6 ± 14.1 years) participated in this study. They were
previously diagnosed with chronic CNP [48]. The
American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment
Classification was used to determine the neurological
level of SCI [49]. A SCI is defined by the level of injury
and the completeness of injury. The level of injury C
(cervical) corresponds to tetraplegia while T (thoracic)
and L (lumbar) to paraplegia. The completeness of injury
is defined as: A-sensory and motor complete, B-sensory
incomplete and motor complete and C and D-sensory
and motor incomplete. Typically sensory D incomplete
are able to walk often with some form of assistive devices, like canes or foot splints. In this study eight participants were able to walk, 9 were paraplegic wheelchair

(2019) 16:128

users who could use their hands while three patients
were tetraplegic and could not use their hands.
There were no inclusion restrictions with respect to the
level or completeness of the injury, as there is no clear evidence between these factors and the incidence of CNP [2].
Table 1 shows participants’ demographic information.
The inclusion criteria were: intensity of CNP ≥ 4 on
the Visual Numerical Scale (VNS, 0 = no pain, 10 = worst
pain imaginable), CNP ongoing for at least 6 months,
aged between 18 and 75 years, no self-reported history
of brain disease or injury, normal or corrected to normal
vision and basic computer skills. The exclusion criteria
were: presence of chronic or acute muscular or visceral
pain ≥4 VNS, epilepsy, stroke, traumatic brain injury or
any other self-reported neurological problem. All participants had below level pain while participants 3, 8 and 12
also had pain at the level of injury. Below level pain has
a central origin and is caused by the injury to the spinal
cord while at level pain may occur due to the injury to
the root or spinal cord, thus it may have central or peripheral origin [50, 51]. Participants typically described
the pain sensation as constant burning or freezing, pins
and needles, tingling or squeezing combined with the
intermittent electrical shock sensations.
Most of the participants were using some types of CNP
medications, such as anticonvulsants and antidepressants,

Page 4 of 24

which in large doses (larger than normally prescribed)
might affect the EEG signal [52]. Participants were asked
not to change their medications throughout the study.
User demographics

All participants had at least secondary school education.
Six participants were employed; six retired, six stopped
working after injury and two were students. All participants lived within a two-hour drive of the spinal injuries
centre. All three tetraplegic and four paraplegic participants had a caregiver (professional or a family member)
who was present during training sessions at the hospital
and later assisted with NFB at home.
User experience

Two participants took part in our previous study 4 years
ago [21] and were familiar with the NFB protocol but had
never used BCI outside the laboratory and on their own.
Although previous practice might have given them the advantage of learning NFB strategy, we do not believe that
after 4 years previous NFB had an effect on their brain
activity. The rest of participants were not familiar with the
concept of NFB. Half of the participants have previously
tried nonpharmacological treatment of CNP, acupuncture or mindfulness, both available through the healthcare system.

User activity
User environment

User environment comprises of “Feedback modality” and
“Location”.
Feedback modality Neurofeedback training was provided in a form of visual feedback, showing EEG power in
selected frequency bands on a graphical user interface.
Location All participants were initially trained at the
hospital. After the initial supervised training they used
the BCI NFB system in their homes. The experimental
protocol is shown in Fig. 2.
User task

User task comprised of “Type of the task” and “Description of the Task”.
Type of the task Here we describe the SCI participant’s
task only. Rhiu et al. [46] suggested that all BCI tasks
should be classified as opened and closed tasks, depending on weather researchers or participants define the
outcome of the task. The NFB tasks can be described as
closed self-managed task, i.e. the neurofeedback task was
set by the researchers (thus is called a closed task) but
patients freely defined the strategy.
Description of the task According to Rhiu et al. this
section describes the end users task within BCI sessions,
and does not include the role of different participants
within the research protocol. We modified this section
to include all participants. The task of the research
group was to perform initial NFB training, assessments
and to provide support (in person or tele support) when
needed throughout the study. Depending on the level of
injury of SCI participants, the task of the caregivers varied from taking notes and photos during training to
doing complete NFB software and hardware settings.
The task for participants with SCI varied depending on
their level of independence. Participants who attended
training on their own, also self-managed NFB therapy.
Participants with caregivers either performed only NFB
without physical contact with a tablet (tetraplegic participants N = 3) or self-managed the NFB software while
caregivers managed the EEG headset (N = 4).
Research Protocol consisted of the following steps (Fig. 2):
1. Familiarization with the study: Interested
participants (N = 20) were invited to the laboratory
for a demonstration of the system.
2. Initial assessment and neurofeedback training: This
involved practicing NFB using a laboratory EEG
device (g.USBamp, Guger Technologies, Austria).
Participants with an initial physical response to

Page 5 of 24

NFB were identified and offered training on a
portable BCI-NF device. The initial assessment of
the effect of neurofeedback on pain consisted of up
to four NFB sessions. The number of sessions was
based on the literature [53], though our results on
able-bodied individuals [45] indicated that people
can learn the NFB strategy within one thirty minute
session. Based on our previous experience [21] we
were looking for sensory responses to NFB such as:
reduction in pain of at least one point on the VNS,
pleasant warmth replacing the sensation of burning
or freezing, tingling in the toes or finger tips, wet
sensation in the legs. Five participants decided to
withdraw before completing all four NFB sessions,
two due to lack of response and three could not
commit to the study.
3. Patient and caregiver training to use a wearable BCI
(N = 15); This involved up to four training sessions
at the hospital with the Emotiv (Epoch, USA)
headset and custom made NFB application. Some
of these training sessions were organized on the
same day as the initial neurofeedback assessment
with g.USBamp, to save patient time. Training
involved three steps:
a. Learning to place the headset at the correct
location on the head.
b. Learning to correctly moisten the electrodes to
achieve low electrode-skin impedance, measured
using Emotiv proprietary software.
c. Learning to use the custom-designed software.
Two manuals were provided to patients, the Emotiv
proprietary manual and a custom written manual for the
NFB application.
4. Home based neurofeedback: Participants were asked
to use the Emotiv device in their homes at least
once a week over a period of 2 months and were
offered the opportunity of keeping the headset and
a tablet with NFB software following completion of
the study. They all attended a follow up meeting in
person at the hospital where they had to
demonstrate independent use of BCI NFB and take
part in a semi-structured interview. Additional
training sessions were organised as required.
Description of the NFB task: NFB can be
classified as a mental task [46]. During NFB,
participants were sitting about 1 meter from the
computer screen (Fig. 3). They had to selfregulate their brain activity from the area of the
primary motor cortex (electrode location C4-C2)
using visual feedback. One training session lasted
30 minutes and was divided into 5 minute sub
sessions to avoid tiredness. Before NFB training,

Fig. 3 a A member of research team demonstrating correct placement of the headset. Long arm EEG electrodes, marked with the arrows were
placed over the central cortex. The electrode from which NFB was provided was placed posteriorly with respect to the imagined vertical line
(dashed red line in the figure) aligned with participants’ ears. The electrode was placed between electrode location C2 and C4, exact location
varies slightly depending on the head size. Image presented in user manual created for patients. b BCI NFB system consisting of EEG headset
and tablet

patient’s baseline EEG activity was recorded for 2
minutes in the relaxed, eyes open state. The task
was to increase (upregulate) the alpha band power
by increasing the size of the middle bar by more
than 10% above the baseline value and to decrease
(downregulate) the theta and beta band power by
more than 10% with respect to the baseline. Bars
were green when related EEG power was in the
desired range, otherwise their colour was red.
Participants were instructed to “keep bars green”.
5. Final assessment with debriefing: This stage
involved questionnaires and EEG data collection
from the tablet given to participants to use at
home. Alternatively, data was collected remotely via
the internet. Data was collected either 2 months
after the first use or upon withdrawal from the
study (e.g. because of unrelated health conditions,
surgical interventions, holidays etc.), whichever
happened first. In addition, sample EEG data was
collected during a 2 weeks check-up meeting to inspect the quality of recorded data
Technology

This section describes the acquisition system, BCI signatures and BCI application.
Acquisition device

There were two acquisition devices, a laboratory universal
16 channel bio signal amplifier, g.USBamp (Guger Technologies, Austria) and a wearable consumer grade EEG
headset Epoch (Emotiv, USA). For the g.USBamp the EEG
sampling frequency was 256 samples/s, the right ear served
as a reference and the left ear as a ground. The electrode-

skin impedance was set to under 5kΩ prior to the EEG recording. EEG signal was filtered between 2 and 30 Hz and
additionally notch filtered at 50 Hz using 5th order IIR
digital Butterworth filters within the g.USBamp device. Previously developed NFB software [21] was used. The NFB
was developed in Simulink, Matlab (Mathworks, USA) and
LavView (National Instruments, USA) using rtsBCI software (Guger technology, Austria). The main reason for
using usbamp was to test participant’s response to NFB
using a higher grade EEG device and to precisely locate
electrode C4 [54] using an EEG cap. Following removal of the EEG cap, a mark from the EEG gel
remained on the participant head. This was used to
position the wearable EEG headset albeit taking a
photo of the location of the headset.
Participants used a 14 channel wearable EEG headset
(Epoch, Emotiv, CA) for NFB training at home. Sampling
frequency was 128 samples/s and two reference electrodes
were placed parietal, above the ears (Fig. 3) for CMS/DRL
noise cancellation. Wireless communication between the
EEG device and tablet, was based on proprietary 2.4GB
wireless technology. Impedance was colour coded going
from black (no contact) to green, where green colour corresponded approximately to 10 kΩ.
The original electrode layout of the Epoch device does
not cover the central cortex. For that reason, the headset
had to be tilted back so that two pairs of long handled
electrodes were located over the central cortex. The
electrode used for NFB was located posterior from the
imagined vertical line going through the patients’ ears
and was located approximately between the C4 and C2
electrode locations (Fig. 3). During training at the hospital a photo was taken from the side, the back and the

Al-Taleb et al. Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation

top for participants as a reminder for setting up the system at home.
BCI hardware comprised of: EEG headset, computer
tablet and a dongle for wireless communication. Software comprised of Emotiv proprietary software and custom made software. Emotiv proprietary software enabled
visualisation of raw EEG and an impedance check. The
NFB application comprised of software for signal processing units and Graphical User Interface (GUI) units.
The former consisted of data acquisition unit and EEG
processing units. The GUI unit consisted of Main GUI
screen, which provided further access to EEG setup
GUI, pain diary GUI and NFB games GUIs. NFB game
GUIs will be described further in the text Fig. 4.

BCI signatures

The protocol developed in Simulink and LabView [21]
was replicated in C++. This was used to enable a large
number of users to use the inexpensive systems at the
same time (without providing Matlab and LabView licence) and to use tablet computers. EEG signal was filtered in four frequency bands: 2–30 Hz, theta (4–8 Hz),
alpha (9–12 Hz) and higher beta (20–30 Hz) using a 5th
order Butterworth filter. Power in each band was calculated over 0.5 s moving average windows and a relative
power was calculated by dividing the power of each band
(theta, alpha and higher beta) by the EEG power in the
2–30 Hz frequency band. In that way, the EEG power in
each frequency band was normalized and expressed as a
percentage irrespective of EEG amplitude of an individual user. Relative power during NFB has been constantly
compared to the baseline values in corresponding bands.
This was reflected by changing colours (from red to
green) in the GUI with bars or by changing speed in a
GUI with cars.

Fig. 4 Hardware and software system structure

Page 8 of 24

For the off-line analysis, due to single channel recording, EEG was inspected manually and signal having an
amplitude greater than 100 μV or containing EOG was
manually removed. On average about 10–20% of EEG
signal was removed.
Somewhat higher alpha band (9–12 Hz), without the
lowest frequency (8 Hz), was chosen because people with
SCI and CNP have on average a lower dominant alpha
frequency than able-bodied people as well as people with
an SCI with no pain [8–11]. The purpose of this was to
increase the dominant alpha frequency through NFB
training as well as to increase the alpha band power. Reduced alpha band is regarded as a signature of chronic
pain in general [55] and was also reported in people with
SCI and CNP.
In parallel participants had to decrease the theta and
higher beta band power, that are normally increased in
people with CNP due to thalamo-cortical dysrhythmia
[8]. Due to dysrhythmia, thalamocortical modules in
theta mode exert less collateral inhibition to the neighbouring modules, which are thereby activated in higher
beta and gamma frequency ranges. This phenomena is
called “the edge effect” [8]. While theta and beta band
were related to EEG signatures of pain, these two bands
are also related to noise coming from blinking (theta
band) and muscle activity (beta band). Thus minimising
theta and beta power also minimised the online noise.
This is a common strategy in commercial NFB software
(e.g. Nexus, Mind Media, the Netherlands).
BCI application

According to the classification proposed by Rhiu et al.
[46] all applications can be classified into three categories (i) replacing lost communication (ii) supplementing
normal function (iii) replacing lost motor function and
promoting neuroplasticity to improve defective function.

Al-Taleb et al. Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation

(2019) 16:128

NFB is an intervention which over time may result in
long term changes of cortical activity [22]. BCI NFB can
be categorised into the third category “promoting neuroplasticity to improve defective function”.
Two different Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) were
available for NFB training (Fig. 5): The first GUI
comprised of three bars, each presenting one frequency band which changed size and colour. A GUI
with three bars was always used for the initial training, to establish a relationship between a mental strategy and EEG power in each frequency band [16]. The
large middle bar represented the relative alpha power
while side bars represented the relative power in theta
and beta bands.
The second GUI modality was a car racing game.
Participants had to increase the speed of a red car,
relative to the speed of the white car. The speed of the
red car was proportional to the combination of values
of all three frequency bands and had three levels. The
speed of the white car was proportional to the baseline
EEG. The red car was fastest when all three frequency
bands were regulated in the correct direction, i.e. when
the alpha power was upregulated and beta and theta
power were downregulated. The speed of the white car
was constant.
The software was used in the following way (Fig. 5):
After the optional setting of EEG parameters (selection
of electrodes and frequency bands) participants filled in
an electronic pain diary (pain level on VNS). Following
this, they recorded their baseline EEG for 2 minutes.
This was followed by NFB with the selected GUI. When
training was finished, before exiting the software, participants had to enter their pain level in the electronic
pain diary, a necessary step in order to exit the
programme. Apart from raw EEG data from a channel
selected for NFB and VNS values from the pain diary,
the system also recorded information about time and
frequency of use.

BCI evaluation
Methods

Methods involved: (i) usability testing by end users and
subsequent analysis of recorded data (EEG, electronic
pain diary), (ii) inquiry methods including observation,
interviews and questionnaires. A functional test of the
NFB software application was performed prior to this
study on able-bodied participants [45].
Measures

Measures of usability were divided into subjective (interviews, questionnaires, pain rating) and objective (EEG
measurement). They were used to create qualitative and
quantitative data. Quantitative data comprised of EEG
recording, VNS pain rating via an electronic pain diary,
questionnaires (Likert scale), and information extracted
from the user activity log files (the frequency of use of
the system and the number of daily sessions).
Qualitative data included questionnaires and semistructured interviews.
Three validated questionnaires were used:
1. “Brief pain inventory” [56] was filled out at the
beginning of the study to determine the location
and the level of pain, independent of its origin.
2. “Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory” (NPSI) [57]
was also administered at the beginning of the study
to evaluate different symptoms of neuropathic pain.
While this questionnaire is widely used for the
assessment of CNP, it is not entirely adequate for
patients with complete SCI injury as they might
sometimes lack symptoms of allodynia and
hyperalgesia, due to the absent sensation.
3. “Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction
questionnaire” (QUESQ) [58] was used to evaluate
the satisfaction with the system usage. QUESQ
consists of twelve questions, eight related to the
device and four related to services. Each question

has 5 level of satisfaction (1-lowest and 5-highest).
Participants were also asked to choose three out of
twelve features that were most relevant for them.
Custom made questionnaires:
1. “Perceived Usefulness of a Device for Home-Based
Treatment of Central Neuropathic Pain”. This was
used to assess patients’ attitudes towards using new
technology, testing perceived usefulness and the
ease of use of the neurofeedback system. This questionnaire was based on a more general questionnaire: “Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use,
and user acceptance” [59].
2. “Attitude and Previous Experience with NonPharmacological Treatments of Neuropathic Pain”.
This was used to assess patients’ attitudes and previous experience with other non-pharmacological
treatments of CNP. Both questionnaires were administered at the beginning of the study.
3. “Neurofeedback System User Questionnaire”
enquired about the participant’s experience of
practicing NFB (perceived level of control, level of
stress) and about specific technical issues of the
EEG device which cannot be assessed by QUESQ.
This questionnaire was administered at the end of
the study.
The purpose of the non-validated questionnaires was
to complement semi-structured interviews and to assure
all participants were asked the same questions. It also
allowed participants to answer the questions in their
own time at home, due to the relatively limited time for
semi-structured interviews.
Semi-structured interviews were organized with the
participants during their check-up visit to the hospital or
during the final assessment. The interviews covered the
topics related to the experience of using hardware and
software as well as the effect of the NFB on pain and
other side effects and NFB strategies. Interviews were
printed verbatim and analysed by two researchers independently (one of the researcher was not present when
the interviews were taking place) to identify the main
topics. Researchers then agreed on the main topics, presented in a two tiered mind map in the results section.
In BCI usability literature, it is common to present the
measures according to the efficiency, effectiveness and
satisfaction (user experience) (44). In the results section
we will present all subjective and performance measures
with respect to these three criteria.
Statistical analysis Mann Whitney U test was used to
compare VNS pain intensity before and after neurofeedback and other demographic data. A significance level of
p = 0.05 was adopted in all cases.

Results
Out of twenty initially recruited participants, fifteen decided
to take part in a home based NFB study (Fig. 2). All participants learned to self-manage BCI NFB and practiced NFB at
home. Seven participants used the system for 2 months as
required. Eight participants discontinued the study for the
following reasons: unrelated health problems (N = 3), new
caregiver (N = 1), moving home (N = 1), too long donning
(> 15 min) (N = 2), broken device (N = 1). EEG data and pain
diaries were collected from all fifteen participants. Nine participants (seven participants who completed 2 months NFB
and two who had to discontinue the study early due to reasons unrelated to the study) took part in final interviews and
filled out user experience questionnaires.
Efficiency

Efficiency refers to the degree to which the product is enabling or hindering the task to be performed in a quick and
economical manner. In this study, measures of efficiency
were adopted such as the number of training and support
sessions, BCI hardware and software donning time, percentage of EEG recorded in the home environment corrupted by noise and the number of NFB sessions per week.
Out of fifteen participants, only one participant required
all four training sessions before taking BCI NFB home. Only
two participants required additional training after taking the
BCI NFB system home (Table 2). About half of the participants practiced NFB 1–3 times weekly while the other half
practiced 3–5 times weekly (Table 2). A NFB session duration was 20–30 min, excluding donning and doffing.
All fifteen participants demonstrated independent use
of the system during a 2 weeks follow up session at the
hospital. Two tetraplegic and four paraplegic participants required caregiver’s assistance.
During a follow up session, we observed BCI NFB
hardware and software setup time for all fifteen participants. It took only two participants longer than 15 minutes to setup the system. The maximum self-reported
setup time for both BCI NFB software and hardware
(donning time) varied from 5 to 10 min (78%) to 10–15
min (22%), N = 9 participants.
On average 10–20% of EEG data had to be removed
prior to analysis due to noise, demonstrating that participants managed to obtain reasonably good quality EEG
signal during self-managed NFB. Analysis of EEG data
was based on data from all fifteen participants.
Out of seven participants who used the system at their
home for 8 weeks or longer, 5 could walk, one was sensory and motor complete paraplegic and one sensory
and motor complete tetraplegic.

particular environment. For BCI applications classification accuracy is a typical measure of effectiveness. Our
BCI application did not have a classifier therefore for a
measure of effectiveness we adopted (i) participant’s
ability to selectively regulate specified frequency bands
and (ii) the effect of NFB on pain. These two measures are
related. Reduction in pain may be placebo effect if there is
no accompanying self-regulation of brain activity. Successful NFB should modulate brain activity selectively, i.e. in
selected frequency bands only. Nonselective upregulation
or downregulation of whole frequency range might indicate changes in general arousal levels rather than engagement in a particular NFB protocol [60].
Although simultaneous control of all 3 frequency bands
is a difficult task, participants were expected to at least upregulate (increase) the central frequency band (alpha), and
to desirably downregulate the theta and beta bands. In a
preceding study on able-bodied participants [45], we observed that people learned to upregulate the alpha rhythm
sooner than to downregulate the theta and beta rhythm.
Ability to control neurofeedback

Figure 6 shows the average percentage change (mean ±
std) for each participant in theta, alpha and higher beta
frequency bands during NFB as compare to the baseline.
Positive values mean that the power in selected band increased while negative values mean that the power

decreased during NFB. Power was calculated in two
ways: in fixed frequency bands as provided during NFB,
theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (9-12 Hz), higher beta (20–30 Hz)
and with respect to the individual alpha peak αp as alpha
band (αp-2 Hz, αp + 2 Hz), theta band (αp-6 Hz, αp-2 Hz)
and higher beta band (αp + 8 Hz, αp + 18 Hz). A dashed
line represents 10% change during NBF, which was the
main training outcome. In addition, statistical analysis
was performed over all training sessions, to assess
whether NFB consistently modulated EEG power in a
desired direction. This was a somewhat conservative approach as it also included early sessions while participants were still learning the NFB technique.
Figure 6 shows that participant’s performance, particularly in the alpha band, was more successful when power
was calculated with respect to the individual alpha band
(αp). Nine out of fifteen participants significantly increased
their individual alpha band compared to four who increased the 9–12 Hz band. If two participants with previous experience in NFB are excluded from the analysis,
eight and four participants significantly increased alpha
band power in the individual and fixed bands respectively.
The choice of individual bands had less impact on the
theta and beta frequency range. Five participants significantly downregulated their individual theta band (αp − 2
to α p − 6 Hz) while four significantly downregulated
fixed theta band (4–8 Hz). Five participants significantly

downregulated individual higher beta band (αp + 8 to α
p + 18 Hz) while four significantly downregulated fixed
higher beta (20–30 Hz) band. However, four participants
consistently modulated beta band power in the wrong
direction, indicating that the beta band was hardest to
regulate. If case that two participants with previous experience with NFB are excluded from the analysis, four
and three participants significantly reduced their theta
band power in the individual and fixed bands respectively while four and five participants significantly reduced their higher beta band power in the individual
and fixed bands respectively. One of these two participants non -selectively increased power in all frequency
bands while the other followed the rules and increased
the alpha and decreased the theta and beta band power.
Fourteen out of the fifteen participants significantly modulated at least one frequency band, eight significantly regulated at least two bands in the desired direction and only
one significantly regulated all three bands in the desired
direction. Three participants non-selectively increased or
decreased EEG power over the whole spectrum.
When only changes in the mean value of the EEG power
were observed, fourteen out of fifteen participants were
able to increase by more than 10% either their individual
α or 9–12 Hz alpha band power. Seven participants
decreased their theta band power (individual or 4–8 Hz)
by 10% or more and ten participants decreased their beta
band power. This indicates that alpha band power was the
most successfully regulated frequency band.
Figure 7 shows several different scenarios during one
representative NFB session. Participant P7 successfully
upregulated the individual dominant frequency while
downregulating theta and beta band power. Participant
P2 downregulated the individual theta and beta band,
his individual dominant peak at 6 Hz remained unchanged but a new peak around 10 Hz emerged when
the 6–8 Hz power was reduced. Finally, participant P3
further increased the existing dominant peak at 6 Hz
while also creating another peak at 10 Hz.
The effect of NFB on pain intensity

Twelve out of fifteen participants achieved a statistically
significant reduction in pain (Mann Whitney U test, p =
0.05). This reduction was clinically significant (> 30%) in
eight participants [61]. Out of ten participants who significantly upregulated the alpha power (αp or 9–12 Hz),

eight had significantly reduced pain. Out of the four
remaining participants who reported a statistically significant reduction of pain, two significantly downregulated both the theta and beta bands. Out of eight
participants who achieved clinically significant reduction
of pain, five were able to walk, two were paraplegic and
one tetraplegic wheelchair users.
Taking into account all 20 participants recruited in the
study this gives an efficacy of 40% (8 out of 20). When
excluding the two participants who had previous experience with NFB, the efficacy is 39% (7 out of 18), being
very similar to the efficacy of the whole cohort.
There was no significant correlation between the level of
pain and the level of injury (p = 0.6949, r = 0.0935), confirming results of previous studies [2]. The level of pain was
not significantly correlated with a time since injury though
the p value was close to the significance level (p = 0.0631,
r = 0.4231) indicating that pain might get worse over time.
No significant correlation was found between the level of
pain and the reduction of pain on the VNS (p = 0.81, r =
0.65), the initial level of pain and the dominant alpha frequency (p = 0.4522, r = − 0.2101), the dominant alpha frequency and the reduction in pain during NFB (p = 0.9703,
r = − 0.0105) and time since injury and the reduction in
pain during NFB (p = 0.9701, r = 0.1010). Likewise, there
was no significant difference in the initial level of pain between walkers (ASIA D) and non-walkers (ASIA A and B)
(Wilcoxon p = 0.7528), nor between participants with incomplete (ASIA B and D) and complete (ASIA A) injury
(Wilcoxon p = 0.6242), though a previous study showed
that people with ASIA A-complete injury have more severe
pain than those with the incomplete injury [48] Table 3.
As part of the final assessment, participants (N = 9) were
asked how long they experienced a reduction in pain following NFB training, Their answers were: never N = 1, during
NFB only N = 1, for at least 1 h following NFB N = 1, for remainder of the day N = 1, day and night N = 2 and longer
than 1 day N = 2. Note that these were not the same participants as those who reported the maximum reduction in pain.
Transfer learning: learning NFB techniques without a
device is one of the important goals of NFB [16]. In our
previous study we recorded EEG in participants experienced with NFB while using a NFB strategy without the
device. They regulated their brain activity in a very
similar manner to actual NFB. Although in this study we
did not explore transfer learning systematically, three

participants reported positive effects of visualising NFB
on pain and on related spasm.
One participant said “I wear headphones at work and
the sensation of wearing the headphones is similar to the
headset. If I’m at work and the spasms kick in, I just
visualise the screen and within 5–10 min the spasms
have gone.”

It is however important to notice that it is necessary to
practice NFB with the device at least once a week to
keep ths ability.

User experience

At the beginning of the study, upon demonstrating a wearable BCI-NFB for the first time to participants (N = 15),
they were asked to rate perceived usefulness and ease of
use of the device as well as their general attitude towards
using novel technology. Participants who had a caregiver
filled in the questionnaire together. Results show that participants are “early adopters” of technology [62]. While high
average scores might increase the risk of bias, for this type
of study which requires relatively high commitment, it was
necessary to have highly motivated participants.
QUESQ questionnaire (N = 9) was filled out on the
final assessment. This is a 5 point questionnaire with 1
being the worst and 5 the best mark. The results of
questionnaire showed that participants were on average
satisfied with the device 4.5 ± 0.8 (median 4.6) and with
the service provided 4.9 ± 0.3 (median 5). The cumulative score for all questions was 4.6 ± 0.5 (median 4.6).
Their main priorities were: effectiveness, ease of use and
comfort (Fig. 8) (Table 4).
To assess the “burden of treatment” participants (N =
9) were asked how much the NFB interfered with their
daily routine and which factors influenced the frequency
of use of BCI NFB. Practicing NFB did not interfere at
all (67.5%) or somewhat interfered (37.5%) with their
daily routine. The single most important factor influencing frequency of use was “other health conditions”
(N = 9), followed by “available time” (N = 6), “pain intensity (N=5), “caregiver time” (N = 3) and “mood” (N = 3).
No other factors were mentioned. During the study,
twelve out of the fifteen participants reported at some
point to the research team unrelated health problems
which to a greater or lesser extent influenced the frequency of use of BCI NFB.

Fig. 8 QUEST User priorities, in percentage. Number of participants N = 9

Page 15 of 24

Participants on average reported that they were most
of the time in control of NFB (7.7 ± 2.3, 1 = never, 10 =
always, N = 9). On average participants felt mildly
stressed when doing NFB for the first time in their own
at homes (2.4 on a scale 1–10, 1 being minimum stress).
It should be noted that 6 participants did not provide responses, so these high scores might be biased (Table 5).
Interviews

Interviews were organised at the first check-up visit
about 2 weeks after starting NFB (N = 15) as well as during the final assessment (N = 9). We also used information from emails and SMS messages in this analysis.
Four main themes were identified: effects of treatment,
usage, hardware and software. Within these topics further subtopics were identified. Figure 9 shows two classification tiers.
Theme “Effects of treatment” had three categories:
 Reduction of pain
 Location of perceived pain (at or below level of

injury: torso, arms, legs, hands, feet), pain reduction,
pain descriptors (burning, squeezing, stinging,
shooting). This is how one of the participants
described the effect of NFB “This training is longer
than I would do my relaxation and it has an
immediate effect in terms of lowering pain. What is
new for me is that there is some residual effect that
lasts three to four days following training where the
pain level is lower and different to what I would
normally experience”. The other participant reported
experiencing the greatest reduction in pain several
hours after treatment “You don’t notice the pain
getting less until maybe an hour later, … , then an

hour later the pain gets less and as the day goes on
and night goes on pain gets less and less”
 Side effects of NFB: negative - hypersensitivity in the
feet, occasional headaches; positive - better sleep, less
spasm, improved foot sensation, pleasant warmth
replacing a burning sensation. The same participant
who reported visualising NFB when wearing
headphones at work said “Spasms at work have
diminished greatly. And I mean greatly. And I’ve only
just clicked that it’s since I’ve started using this [BCINFB] that when I put the headphones on at work, the
spasms diminish”. Another participant wrote in an
email “I am still getting a brilliant sleep with no spasms
even to the point I have slept in a few mornings.”
Theme “Usage” had five categories:
 Preferred time of use (morning, evening, when pain

is worst). Most participants practiced NFB in the
evening because that was when they had free time
and also when pain was worst. Reducing pain in the
evening improved sleep.
 Location of use (bedroom, any place with no
distractions)
 Usage pattern (20–30 min daily, 1–7 times a week).
The usage pattern depends on the available time of a
caregiver (professional caregivers were available for
several hours a day and their priority was to provide
assistance with activities of daily living; family
caregivers were more flexible as they were typically
not helping with personal hygiene and had more
time). One person with tetraplegia changed
caregivers during the study and the new caregiver
was trained to use BCI-NFB.
 Reasons for abandonment: unrelated health issues e.g.
infections, changes in daily routine such as moving
home, holidays and negative opinion of a family doctor.

 Usage strategy: in addition to relaxation which is

recommended for NFB in general, participants often
mentioned “thinking of happy memories” e.g.,
favourite holiday on a beach, riding a horse etc.
Theme “Software” comprised of two categories:
 Usage pattern and related problems: forgetting

instructions, small font warning messages. Some
participants also reported that the system was easy
to use. The preferred GUI for all participants was
the one with bars.
 Suggested improvements: step-by-step instruction
on screen, better measure of daily performance, increased font size of warning messages
Theme “Hardware” comprised of three categories:
 Usage patterns and related problems: no problems,

awkward to put on, slipping from the head,
uncertain about the quality of EEG, hard to get low
impedance, robustness, headset breaking, caregiver
availability vs NFB training time
 Setup time: ranging from 5 to 30 min (two
participants who reported 30 min withdraw early)
 Suggested improvements: dedicated headset for pain
treatment (to be placed over the central cortex),
increased robustness, unambiguous location on the
head.
Performance measure

This has to some extent already been addressed under
interview topics Software and Hardware. In addition,
nine participants provided feedback about technical usability of the EEG headset, as a part of the final assessment
(Fig. 10). The answers indicate that the main technical
problem was to determine the correct location of

electrodes (2/9) and to prevent the device from slipping

interview during the check-up sessions were: “How to
achieve better contact with electrodes/low impedance”,
“How to start the device?” (forgetting to switch on a headset, forgetting to use a dongle), “How to leave the software?” (forgetting to fill out a mandatory electronic pain
diary). Two devices got damaged during home use but in
only one case the damage prevented further use. However,

Discussion
In this study we investigated whether people with SCI
and with CNP can practice NFB on their own or with
the help of their caregivers at home. Although all participants suffered from long standing CNP their level and
completeness of injury varied, which enabled us to

Fig. 10 Experience with using BCI hardware (N = 9)

investigate the needs of people with different levels of
disability. Data had been collected in a home environment, experiencing environmental noise, while using a
consumer grade EEG.
BCI user centred design has four stages [44]: understand and specify the context of use, specify the user requirements, produce design solution to meet user
requirements and evaluate design against requirements.
Most usability studies present only the last stage.
We have adopted a usability framework which was developed based on previously published studies [46]. This
study demonstrates that it is also suitable for presenting
the original data. We made only minor modifications to
include participants in a wider sense, including the research team and their experience with training and technical support throughout the study. While technical
support is an integral part of QUEST is it typically not
included in BCI usability studies. Although this study
only touches on that topic, we suggest that in the future
service support should be an integral part of home based
usability studies.
The challenge in developing home based BCI was to
create a system that was easy to use, reliable and accessible to people with disabilities and their caregivers. Notwithstanding was a requirement to create an inexpensive
system by using consumer grade EEG and a freeware
software platform, in order to provide at the same time
BCI to a relatively large number of end users within a
limited budget. We used C++ rather than Matlab which
is cheaper and adequate for tablet computers. In the future C++ can be used with mobile phone applications.

The number of participants in the study (20) was relatively small, compared to studies focused solely on the
effectiveness of a therapy. On the other hand, twenty
participants is a relatively large number for BCI usability
studies on patients, which often had less than 10 participants [46, 63, 64]. While we demonstrated the effectiveness of NFB for a relatively niche group of patients,
other aspect of usability, such as efficiency and user satisfaction are of relevance for a wider patient community
that might use BCI for home based treatments. In
addition, under a hypothesis that thalamo-cortical dysrhythmia is the core of CNP [65], and that it has EEG
markers which are independent of the aetiology of the
neuropathic pain [66] one might argue that similar NFB
protocol might be effective in other patient groups.
Apart from Daly et al. [34] study, our study is one of the
rare usability studies of a therapeutic use of BCI. Our participants used BCI on their own for 2 months, that provided the opportunity to observe not only experiences of
patients, but also of the research team providing service
support (communication channels, frequency of communication, technical issues). During the study, the main
challenge for the research team was to provide sustained
technical support throughout the study and to constantly
keep in touch with a relatively large number of people
without having a dedicated person solely for this task.
Continuous communication and encouragement was essential because small changes in daily routine were often
reasons for temporarily stopping treatment. Larger yet unavoidable obstacles were frequent health problems which
are common in people with SCI.

Effectiveness

Five out of twenty initially recruited participants were either not able to control NFB or found the protocol too
demanding (difficult to use or time consuming). However, all fifteen interested participants learned how to
use the system within four sessions. There are several
factors which contributed to successful learning. We created custom made user manuals and instructed participants to take photos or videos of themselves as a
reminder of the setup procedure. Other research groups
have also reported recording EEG from the central cortex using Emotiv, however this was performed by researchers rather than by participants [63]. An additional
facilitating factor was that the consumer EEG device
used has been designed for non-professionals and has
additional sources of information on the Internet. The
donning time in this study was up to 15 minutes, comparable to results of studies managed by caregivers only
[31]. This time would probably be reduced if the headset
had been originally designed to cover the central cortex.
During NFB with the Epoch, we recorded EEG from one
electrode location only to minimise the setup time,
though we instructed participants to check impedance
levels of all electrodes.
Participants reported low levels of stress when using
BCI for the first time at home on their own. We did not
use NASA task load index [67] because asking participants to fill this questionnaire regularly at home would
likely result in a low level of compliance. The answer
that we collected was based on recollection, during participants’ check-up visits to the hospital.
Although previous studies showed that Epoch had reasonable performances [63, 68], they were performed
under laboratory conditions. Our results showed that in
the home environment, only 10–20% of recorded data
was very noisy, which is an extremely encouraging result
for future real world BCI applications. On the other
hand, the physical design of the headset which was not
originally created to record EEG from the central cortex
was the major problem, in particular for those with
smaller heads or thick hair. To the best of our knowledge, at the moment there is no other consumer grade
multichannel EEG device that is designed to record
brain activity with non-gel electrodes from the sensorymotor cortex, costing under £1000. Inexpensive technical solutions for EEG recordings (e.g OpenBCI) could
be used with custom made headsets but do not provide
easy solutions for non-professional users. As noted by
Miralles et al. [30] the price of BCI is currently the
biggest restricting factor for large scale usability studies
in the home environment.
Most participants preferred training with bars rather than
with cars. One reason might be that the car game was not
as entertaining as games available with commercial NFB

Page 19 of 24

devices but the other reason could be that the GUI with
bars provided clearer response-reinforcement association
which could be overshadowed by more complex games
[16]. In this study a threshold for NFB was fixed throughout
the training, based on the baseline measurement for that
day. NFB practitioners occasionally use a “moving” threshold based on the most recent performance in order to provide a reward, irrespective of patient performance. This
may however lead to training in an undesired direction [16]
and would make later quantitative analysis difficult.
Efficacy

Efficiency was measured by the ability to control NFB and
to achieve reduction in pain. The principle of NFB is operant conditioning, a learning strategy that increases a preferred behaviour and decreases the undesired behaviour
by providing a reward or punishment [69]. Results from
the literature show that similar to the general BCI
illiteracy problem, some people cannot learn to use NFB
[70]. Prior to this study, we tested the NFB protocol with
Emotiv in one 30 min session on eighteen able bodied
people [45]. Fourteen participants increased the alpha
power by more than 10%, eight decreased theta and seven
decreased higher beta by more than 10%. In the current
study, only two participants were not able to control NFB.
An important measure of successful NFB is selectivity,
i.e. the ability to regulate only selected frequency bands rather than to increase or decrease the whole frequency
spectrum [60]. Twelve out of fifteen participants selectively modulated frequency bands as required by NFB
while three increased or decreased the whole frequency
spectrum. Similar to able-bodied participants, participants
with CNP were most successful upregulating the alpha
band with twelve out of fifteen participants upregulating it
by more than 10%, seven downregulated theta and ten
downregulated their beta band power by more than 10%.
An important observation is that most participants actually upregulated their individual alpha range (6–8 Hz)
which on average was lower than in able bodied people,
while some participants created two ‘peaks‘, one around
their individual alpha and the other in the 9-12 Hz
range. A reduced dominant alpha frequency was reported in several previous studies [8–11] and has been
attributed to the thalamo-cortical dysrhythmia [68]. In
our recent study [12] we found that the reduced alpha
power and reduced dominant alpha frequency are both
markers of “future” CNP. This NFB protocol was aiming
to increase not only the alpha power but also the dominant alpha frequency. However, results of this study indicate that alpha amplitude rather than alpha frequency is
related to the reduction in pain. We did not notice an
issue with individual alpha bands when previously testing the NFB protocol on able-bodied [45] because their
average dominant alpha frequency was within 8–12 Hz.

Al-Taleb et al. Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation

(2019) 16:128

The efficacy of NFB was 40% i.e. in 8 out of 20 initially
recruited participants, the reduction in pain was clinically
significant, i.e. larger than 30% [61]. These are encouraging
results, that should be used to estimate the effect size in a
future larger randomised clinical trial. Although results of
a single trial cannot be directly compared to the results of
a meta-analysis, the meta-analysis results of other pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments should
serve as a desirable target. According to a Cochrane database study, gabapentin, a widely used pharmacological
treatment of CNP [71], has an efficacy of 50%. The efficiacy
of NFB should also be compared to the other neuromodulatory treatments of CNP such as rTMS and tDCS,
although rTMS is still not available for home use. A recent
Cohrane review showed that rTMS on average results in
12%, while tDCS results in 17% short term relief in pain
[72]. That study adopted 15% as a clinically relevant reduction in pain, meaning that only tDCS may result in a clinically significant reduction in pain. If we addopted 15% as
clinically significant reduction of pain in this study, then 13
out of 20 participants (65%), would achieve clinically
significant reduction of pain.
Looking at the relationship between NFB and the reduction in pain, eight out of twelve participants whose pain
was significantly reduced also had a significant increase in
the alpha band power. Out of the remaining four patients
who had a significant reduction in pain without significantly upregulating the alpha power, two significantly
downregulated both theta and beta band power. A multivariate analysis, which was outwit the scope of this usability study may reveal more complex relations between
different NFB parameters and the reduction in pain.
For six out of fifteen participants who could walk
(ASIA D) pain was the major cause of restricted activity.
Five of them used the system for 2 months and achieved
statistically significant reduction of pain. This indicates
that being able to self-administer NFB when and where
needed might have a positive effect on the compliance
and the effectiveness of NFB.
A limitation of this study is that there was no explicit
test for placebo effect. There are two options to test for
placebo: the first one is to occasionally blindfold participants to practice NFB with a pre-recorded session or
from another area of the cortex. We tested both approaches in our previous laboratory based study, but this
would have been hard to achieve in the present study
because of infrequent direct contact with patients and
because of transfer learning. The other option to test for
placebo effect is to have a control group, which might be
unethical in long-term studies due to the level of
commitment expected by participants.
The presence of a trusted authority (a researcher or a
therapist) may also have a placebo effect [16]. In this
study however, participants practiced NFB on their own.

Page 20 of 24

We cannot however exclude that shifting locus of control from external to internal did not have a placebo effect. On the other hand one can argue that sham
neurofeedback provided from an active electrode might
also induce a similar placebo effect.
In this study, instead of placebo test, we collected patient
self-reported descriptions of sensations related to NFB (tingling, pleasant warm sensation etc) [21] that accompany reduction in pain, to quickly assess whether there was any
effect of NFB. We showed that out of 10 participants who
significantly upregulated the alpha power, eight achieved
significant reduction of pain. We also checked whether pain
reduction lasted beyond the NFB training.
In this study NFB training was provided from C4
which is located over the primary motor cortex of the
left hand. The same location that proved to be most effective for rTMS and tDCS treatments of CNP [15]. It is
believed that the mechanism of action of these treatments is through collateral neural branching [73] which
explains why it is not necessary to apply NFB for CNP
in a somatotopic manner. In [21] we showed that NFB
from C4 also affects the motor cortex symmetrically
over the contralateral side (electrode location C3).
Satisfaction is defined by the degree a product is giving
contentment or making the user satisfied. Judging by the
results of questionnaires assessing participant’s attitude
towards novel technology and the perceived usefulness
of BCI-FES all participants were “early adopters” of technology. These questionnaires were answered jointly by
the participants with SCI and their caregivers and they
jointly provided high scores. It shows that for adoption
of new assistive or therapeutic technology it is important
to motivate both patients and caregivers. An important
issue emerged during interviews, that caregivers are typically not available for the whole day and that quick BCI
donning is extremely important because of the overall
limited time that caregivers could devote to the therapy.
Previous studies investigating BCI priorities in people
with SCI included only questionnaires without actual
use of BCI [74]. For this reason this study might provide
useful information regarding the design of home based
BCI studies with the SCI population, beyond NFB.
Results of QEUST showed that participants who completed the study were on average very satisfied with both
the device and technical support (services) provided by
the research team. According to QUEST the main priorities were functionality, ease of use, comfort and dimensions, which are similar to user priorities from other BCI
usability studies. A very encouraging result is that most
participants did not feel stigmatised by using a headset
in front of other people at home. It should be however
noted that not all participants completed the questionnaire and that three participants initially withdrew from
the study as they perceived the BCI NFB system to be

Al-Taleb et al. Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation

(2019) 16:128

too complex. Fifteen out of twenty initially recruited participants, who stayed on the study were “early adopters”
of technology and their level of commitment and satisfaction might not necessarily translate to more general
users of this technology. However, feedback from “early
adopters” is valuable for improving the technology to
make it acceptable for more general patient population.
We identified four main themes in the semi-structured
interviews: effect of NFB, usage pattern, problems with
hardware and problems with software. The main effect
of NFB was a reduction in pain but participants also reported other positive side effects such as reduced spasm
and reduced foot drop, improved sensation and proprioception. Finnerup [75] recently suggested similarities in
neuronal origin of spasticity and CNP, such as differentiation of supraspinal neurons. Thus, a neuromodulatory
intervention applied to the motor cortex, which affects
one might affect the other phenomena. Tingling and a
pleasant warm sensation were also reported frequently
accompanying NFB, and these were also typically the
first symptoms to NFB. This is indirect evidences of
modulation of the sensory-motor cortex that is typically
overactive in people with SCI and SCP [6]. Similar sideeffects were also reported in our previous study [21].
Side effect reported in this study should be interpreted
with caution, because they were not systematically monitored. Future, large scale, trials should incorporate sensory and spasticity test in the protocol. Alternatively, a
NFB study that focuses solely on spasticity in people
with SCI with preserved mobility would provide results
that are more conclusive.
We did not separately assess satisfaction of people with
SCI and their caregivers because only six out of fifteen
participants had a caregiver and because caregivers’ roles
varied from patient to patient. Only two tetraplegic
patients required a caregiver to initiate NFB software.
An interesting observation was that patients often considered happy episodic memories during NFB, as a mind wandering strategy, indicating the involvement of the default
mode network [76]. This was unfortunately not possible to
explore further due to single channel EEG recording.
The single main factor affecting the frequency of use
of BCI was other health related issues which are fairly
common in people with SCI (e.g. urinary tract infection,
skin problems etc.). Our ethical permission did not allow
us to get insight into all medications that participants
took. However we have checked that during study they
did not change dosage of pain medications, did not start
any non- pharmacological treatment and did not aquire
any neurological issues, that would affect their EEG. We
also noticed that any disruption to the daily routine
could potentially disrupt the usage pattern, indicating
the need for regular monitoring in the early phase of
adopting new technology. Other factors influencing

Page 21 of 24

frequency of use were available time and pain intensity.
However, in some cases family doctors (general practitioners) were concerned about possible side effects of
BCI as they were unfamiliar with it. This indicates the
importance of educating healthcare professionals i.e.
trusted persons for a wider user acceptance of BCI
technology.
Problems with hardware mainly arose because the
EEG headset had to be tilted, i.e. it was not placed on
the head as it was designed for. Some previous studies
also used this setup to record EEG from the sensorymotor cortex [63]. Patients frequently used elastic bands
to keep the hardware in place. Getting a good electrode
contact with wet electrodes was also an issue mostly
during the first few sessions but was a reason for abandoning the study by patients with thick or long hair. Forgetting to use a dongle or switch the device on were also
frequent reasons for seeking help from the research
group. Online monitoring of signal quality and automatic noise removal would be a bonus for any future
BCI hardware designed for home use [77].
Software was not a source of concern because it has
been thoroughly tested on able-bodied volunteers [45].
The largest problem during the first few sessions was remembering the instructions. Based on participants’ feedback, we plan to incorporate the following features in the
next version of the NFB software: simpler measure of NFB
performance with an electronic diary (current version
does not have a diary); step-by-step instruction which
could be switched off once participants become experienced with the software, larger font warning messages, a
simplified one page software instruction and a car game
GUI with better graphics. The NFB software has been designed in a way that it is independent of the hardware so
in the future it could be used with custom-made headsets
which are designed to cover the sensory-motor cortex.
Another feature that would be useful to incorporate is
an audio warning related to the on-line monitoring of the
signal quality. Interestingly, most participants reported
that they could recognise from the dynamic of the visual
feedback with bars whether they were successfully doing
NFB or if the signal was of poor quality. That might
explain why GUI with bars was preferred by all users, as it
provided direct control of all features that should be controlled by NFB. We did not specifically test for the locus
of control [78], though “being in control of pain” was
probably a major drivers behind this treatment.

Conclusions
The study demonstrates the feasibility of home-based
patient and caregiver managed NFB therapy for CNP.
The results of this study should encourage other researchers to take BCI from labs and hospitals to patients’
homes and should inform the developers of wearable

Al-Taleb et al. Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation

(2019) 16:128

consumer BCI devices. The study also demonstrates that
the novel usability framework can be successfully applied
to the original study rather than to retrospective data.
The efficiency analysis showed that patients with different levels of disability, with or without a caregiver, can
successfully operate BCI for a prolonged period of time,
getting a reasonable quality EEG signal. Effectiveness
analysis showed that 40% of patients achieved clinically
significant relief of pain,. According to the average score
from QUESQ, user satisfaction was high. An important
finding relevant for designers of wearable BCI technology is that there seems to be no significant stigma to
using wearable EEG device in public.
Results from the interviews and observation analysis
provide useful information regarding future improvements in NFB software application. While the current
hardware solution was acceptable by most of participants, observation and interviews identified the need for
dedicated hardware designed to wirelessly record from
the central area of the cortex covered by hair, using non
gel electrodes. This would also be relevant for a range of
BCI applications for stroke and other patient groups.
Due to the pragmatic, uncontrolled nature of the study
it was not possible to test for placebo effects, through
there was evidence of correlation between selective
modulation of brain activity and reduction in pain. EEG
recording was limited to a single electrode to reduce
donning time. Only half of the participants completed
the trial, in most cases due to health issues and other
reasons not directly related to NFB.
Results of the study are relevant for developers of BCI
applications working with the SCI population, including
assistive and rehabilitative BCI technology.
