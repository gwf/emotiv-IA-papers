The hypothesis that people respond to reminders of mortality with closed-minded,
ethnocentric attitudes has received extensive empirical support, largely from research
in the Terror Management Theory (TMT) tradition. However, the basic motivational
and neural processes that underlie this effect remain largely hypothetical. According
to recent neuropsychological theorizing, mortality salience (MS) effects on cultural
closed-mindedness may be mediated by activity in the behavioral inhibition system (BIS),
which leads to passive avoidance and decreased approach motivation. This should
be especially true for people motivated to avoid unfamiliar and potentially threatening
stimuli as reflected in a high need for closure (NFC). In two studies involving moderated
mediation analyses, people high on trait NFC responded to MS with increased BIS
activity (as indicated by EEG and the line bisection task), which is characteristic of
inhibited approach motivation. BIS activity, in turn, predicted a reluctance to explore
foreign cultures (Study 1) and generalized ethnocentric attitudes (Study 2). In a third
study, inhibition was induced directly and caused an increase in ethnocentrism for people
high on NFC. Moreover, the effect of the inhibition manipulation × NFC interaction on
ethnocentrism was explained by increases in BIS-related affect (i.e., anxious inhibition)
at high NFC. To our knowledge, this research is the first to establish an empirical
link between very basic, neurally-instantiated inhibitory processes and rather complex,
higher-order manifestations of intergroup negativity in response to MS. Our findings
contribute to a fuller understanding of the cultural worldview defense phenomenon by
illuminating the motivational underpinnings of cultural closed-mindedness in the wake of
existential threat.

INTRODUCTION
According to cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker, humans are uniquely preoccupied as
“terrified, death-avoiding animal[s]” (Becker, 1997, p. 99). Inspired by Becker’s writings, terror
management theory (TMT) proposes that humans avoid the threat of death on a symbolic level
by identifying with something that outlasts their individual life, such as their nation or culture

NFC and BIS in Ethnocentrism

“when confronted with reminders of their mortality, people
avoid the subjective experience of distress by increasing their
commitment to the cultural worldview” (Greenberg et al., 1995b,
p. 431). In sum, TMT proposes that threat leads people to shy
away from cultural outgroups and cling to cultural ingroups in
order to avoid the distress inherent in the existential insecurities
aroused by reminders of the finitude of life.

(Pyszczynski et al., 1997). In support of this proposition,
numerous TMT studies have demonstrated that people respond
to mortality salience (MS) with increased adherence to their
cultural worldviews, which often manifests in avoidance and
derogation of culturally different people, customs, and ideologies
(Burke et al., 2010). Hence, this research reveals a fascinating
irony inherent in human efforts at self-preservation: in order
to manage death-related anxiety, people develop an aversion
to the cultural “other,” thereby curtailing their opportunities
for psychologically enriching experiences. In other words, an
unfortunate consequence of “huddling in the defended fortress”
is that people avoid sampling opportunities provided by getting
to know other cultures and their members.
Although it is well-documented that MS can drive cultural
closed-mindedness, little is known about the basic neural and
motivational processes that underlie this effect. According to the
process model of threat and defense (Jonas et al., 2014), MSinduced aversion to cultural otherness may be mediated by a very
basic motivation to avoid punishment. In the present research,
we test this assumption using neurobehavioral measures of the
activity of the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) as measured
by the line bisection task (LBT; Study 1) and frontal alpha
asymmetry as measured by EEG (Study 2). We also directly
manipulate the proposed inhibitory motivational mediator.
Specifically, we investigate whether (a) MS activates inhibitory
motivational processes, (b) inhibition mediates MS effects on
cultural closed-mindedness, and (c) these effects are particularly
strong for persons with a dispositional inclination to avoid
unfamiliar and potentially threatening stimuli.

The General Process Model of Threat and
Defense
Recent neuropsychological theorizing suggests that MS-induced
discomfort with cultural otherness is rooted in a basic motivation
to avoid negative/punishing outcomes (Jonas et al., 2014).
Specifically, the process model of threat and defense (Jonas et al.,
2014) states that MS activates the BIS, an avoidance motivational
system that responds to distant or anticipated threat (such as
one’s eventual demise), which inhibits ongoing goal approach
(McNaughton and Corr, 2004). The inhibition of goal approach
functions to reorient the individual’s attention so that threat
can be resolved and viable goal pursuit resumed (cf. McGregor
et al., 2009). This dynamic is accompanied by several attentional,
affective, and motivational processes, including hypervigilance,
anxious arousal, and the motivation to avoid threat by inhibiting
behaviors that might put the individual at risk (passive avoidance;
Gray and McNaughton, 2000; McNaughton and Corr, 2004; Corr
et al., 2013a)1 .
Importantly, upon detecting stimuli signaling the potential
for conflict or punishment, the BIS further biases negativity,
which entails a tendency to avoid everything that is unfamiliar
and potentially threatening (McNaughton and Corr, 2004,
2014). Accordingly, passive threat-avoidance strategies include
the inhibition of exploratory approach behavior in order to
maintain distance from potentially threatening stimuli (e.g., here,
potentially hostile outgroup members), especially in risky or
unfamiliar contexts. From an evolutionary perspective, members
of cultural outgroups represent unfamiliar and potentially
threatening stimuli, since hostile strangers may have been among
the most serious ancestral threats to survival (McEachron and
Baer, 1982; see also Kenrick et al., 2010). Accordingly, we propose
that reminders of mortality activate a basic threat-avoidance
system—the BIS—that subsequently inhibits the motivation to
engage with cultural outgroups. This proposed process is similar
to the TMT account of MS sequelae, but it differs in one
key way: people’s defensive responses to MS are not merely
anticipatory of a negative motivational-emotional state (in TMT,
the potential for anxiety; Pyszczynski et al., 1999), but instead
these defenses are driven by BIS-mediated processes, such as

Terror Management and Avoidance
Motivation
According to TMT, the awareness of one’s inevitable demise
entails the potential for paralyzing terror, which can be managed
by defensive processes that are oriented toward symbolic
self-preservation (Pyszczynski et al., 1997). Symbolic selfpreservation is attained by identifying with entities that transcend
one’s individual death, such as cultural ingroups. Accordingly,
there is ample evidence that MS increases cultural closedmindedness in the form of more negative (positive) evaluations
of the culturally unfamiliar (familiar; Burke et al., 2010).
Terror management theorists have generally assumed that
these defenses are products of a basic motivation to avoid
threatening cognitions (Pyszczynski et al., 1997, 2000, 2012).
According to TMT, mortality threat is initially avoided
by cognitive means, such as death-thought suppression or
vulnerability denial (i.e., proximal defense; Pyszczynski et al.,
1999). Second, after this active cognitive avoidance has subsided,
subtle mechanisms of threat-avoidance are utilized to maintain
defenses on a symbolic level (i.e., distal defense; Pyszczynski
et al., 1999). These distal defenses often manifest in various forms
of ethnocentric intergroup bias (e.g., avoidance and derogation
of foreign people and worldviews; Burke et al., 2010). In other
words, defensive responses to MS are assumed to be mediated
by the motivation to avoid experiencing terror in the face of
inescapable mortality (Greenberg et al., 2003). TMT argues that

Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org

1 Corr et al. (2013a) propose a distinction between a system for passive avoidance,
generated by the BIS (e.g., inhibition of approach motivational behavior toward
unfamiliar and potentially threatening people or places), and a system for active
avoidance, produced by the fight-flight-freeze system (FFFS; e.g., running away
from a predator). Contrary to the BIS that responds to more distant, abstract,
and ambiguous threats, the FFFS responds to more proximate, concrete, and
unequivocal threats, such as immediate attackers. The present line of research
pertains to existential threats, which are more distant, abstract, and ambiguous
(e.g., the time and way of one’s death is usually unknown; see also Huang and
Wyer, 2015). Therefore, we focus on BIS-mediated passive avoidance motivational
responses to threat in this paper.

NFC and BIS in Ethnocentrism

high NFC may be indicative of the BIS-mediated negativity
bias toward exaggerated threat perceptions and subsequent
avoidance behaviors (McNaughton and Corr, 2004). The
reluctance to engage with culturally-different stimuli following
MS exhibited by high NFC people may reflect BIS-mediated
inhibition of approach motivation under threat. On a more
general level, Jonas et al. (2014) have proposed that BIS-related
traits intensify and prolong BIS activity after threat. This is
in line with neuroscientifically-informed theorizing regarding
the hierarchical interplay between trait and state avoidance
motivation (Elliot, 2006; Spielberg et al., 2013). In sum, people
with high trait NFC are likely to show increased levels of BISmediated passive avoidance following MS, which may explain
why NFC has been linked to many avoidance-related outcomes
in previous TMT research.

motivational inhibition and felt anxious uncertainty, that are
aroused immediately following the contemplation of one’s death.
Although increased ethnocentric thinking has been frequently
found following MS (Burke et al., 2010), the mediating processes
proposed by the general process model (Jonas et al., 2014) are to
date largely hypothetical. Advancing on this empirical gap from
the general process model is all the more important given what is
arguably equivocal evidence for TMT’s main cognitive mediator
candidate—death-thought accessibility (Das et al., 2009; Golec de
Zavala et al., 2012; Trafimow and Hughes, 2012; Agroskin and
Jonas, 2013; Hart, 2014). This failure has spawned a lively debate
in the existential threat literature about whether MS-induced
ethnocentrism might be driven by specific needs to restore
meaning (Proulx and Heine, 2010), certainty (van den Bos et al.,
2005), security (Hart et al., 2005), a sense of coalition (Navarrete
et al., 2004), or control (Fritsche et al., 2008). However, it has also
been proposed that MS-induced defensiveness may be driven by
rather basic processes such as approach motivational (McGregor
et al., 2013) or unconsciously vigilant (Holbrook et al., 2011)
responses to any kind of threat. By contrast, Jonas et al. (2014)
have suggested that MS effects on ethnocentric cognitions and
behaviors are attributable to BIS-generated passive avoidance of
cultural novelty. The present research tests this novel notion.

The Role of BIS Activity in Mortality
Salience Effects
Although the hypothesis that MS effects on ethnocentric thinking
are mediated by BIS activity has not yet been explicitly tested yet,
there is some evidence suggesting an association between MS and
BIS-related processes. For instance, people prefer familiar over
unfamiliar products after experiencing death anxiety, suggesting
a basic tendency toward novelty-avoidance (Huang and Wyer,
2015). MS also causes people to avoid stimuli that remind them
of their embodied, temporal existence (Goldenberg et al., 2001;
Cox et al., 2007), which suggests that MS inclines an avoidance
of information that would further highlight a threat. Finally,
people are even reluctant to look into mirrors and engage in
self-focused writing under MS, possibly because heightened selfawareness exacerbates distressing vulnerability concerns after
contemplating one’s own death (Arndt et al., 1998).
In line with the process model of threat and defense (Jonas
et al., 2014), these avoidance reactions are particularly likely to
occur for individuals with anxious personalities. For example,
MS has been found to aggravate anxious and avoidant behaviors
among people especially prone to phobic or compulsive
behaviors (Strachan et al., 2007), such as people high on BIS and
trait anxiety (Smits and Boeck, 2006; Bijttebier et al., 2009; Erdle
and Rushton, 2010). Furthermore, stimuli related to physicality
and creatureliness are particularly problematic for persons high
in neuroticism after MS (Goldenberg et al., 2000, 2006a,b,
2008). Finally, research from diverse labs demonstrates noveltyavoidant, risk-averse behaviors under conditions of threat and
anxiety (e.g., Maner and Schmidt, 2006; Maner et al., 2007;
Mortensen et al., 2010; Litt et al., 2011; Clark et al., 2012; see
Kenrick et al., 2010 for review), and these reactions appear to
be especially likely for people high on BIS-related traits (Landau
and Greenberg, 2006; Cavallo et al., 2009; Routledge et al., 2010).
Taken together, these results are consistent with the notion that
BIS-sensitive people are particularly prone to passive-avoidant
behaviors in the wake of threat (Jonas et al., 2014).

Individual Differences in MS Effects on
Cultural Closed-Mindedness
TMT research has demonstrated that individual differences in
traits related to motivated avoidance of the unfamiliar are useful
predictors of terror management processes. For instance, persons
with high need for closure (NFC; Webster and Kruglanski,
1994), who strive for simple, unambiguous, and predictable
environments, are accordingly reluctant to explore novel or
ambiguous stimuli under threat, such as unfamiliar places (Vess
et al., 2009)2 . They also tend to adopt ethnocentric or xenophobic
attitudes, suggesting that their discomfort with ambiguity and
unfamiliarity biases their evaluations of cultural outgroups (Shah
et al., 1998; Agroskin and Jonas, 2010, 2013). Accordingly, high
NFC has been found to amplify MS effects on derogation of
culturally different beliefs, such as differing religious worldviews
(Juhl and Routledge, 2010). On a more general level, the unease
with unfamiliar, unpredictable, and ambiguous stimuli following
MS exhibited by people with high trait NFC can also manifest
in heightened stereotypic thinking, as well as antipathy toward
behaviorally inconsistent persons and even modern art (Schimel
et al., 1999; Landau et al., 2004, 2006). Low NFC, conversely,
is related to openness to novelty, uncertainty, and ambiguity,
thus promoting increased interest in exploring unfamiliar stimuli
following MS (Vess et al., 2009). In sum, high NFC appears
to represent a disposition to avoidance-related cognition and
behaviors, especially under threat.
This avoidance-motivational interpretation of NFC is
bolstered by the fact that chronic BIS sensitivity and NFC are
positively related (Corr et al., 2013b). This again suggests that

Measuring BIS Activity

some studies discussed in this paper, NFC was measured with the personal
need for structure (PNS) scale (Neuberg and Newsom, 1993), which has been used
as an alternative operationalization of NFC in prior TMT research (e.g., Dechesne
et al., 2000).

In neural terms, BIS activity has been linked to relative righthemispheric brain activity, as reflected in prefrontal EEG
alpha asymmetry. Specifically, dispositional BIS sensitivity is

central, parietal, temporal, or occipital asymmetry, suggesting
that the LBT represents a neurobehavioral marker specific to
frontal alpha asymmetry (Nash et al., 2010). In sum, the LBT
has often been used to measure motivational tendencies (see
Vallortigara and Rogers, 2005 for a review of motivationallyrelevant perceptual asymmetries), and has been validated as a
neurobehavioral measure of asymmetric frontal brain activation
(Nash et al., 2010).

associated with stronger relative right-frontal brain activation,
whereas BAS sensitivity is robustly related to greater left-frontal
activation (Sutton and Davidson, 1997; Shackman et al., 2009).
There is also evidence linking frontal asymmetric activity to
prevention/promotion regulatory focus, which is conceptually
related to BIS/BAS activity, respectively (Amodio et al., 2004).
Importantly, relative frontal EEG activity is computed using
difference scores between right- and left-frontal electrodes,
implying that increased BIS-related right-frontal asymmetry
is functionally equivalent to reduced BAS-related left-frontal
asymmetry and vice-versa (e.g., Sutton and Davidson, 1997). This
is also consistent with an inverse interrelationship between the
activity of both hemispheres (e.g., Amodio et al., 2004) and the
joint subsystems hypothesis of BIS/BAS activity in reinforcement
sensitivity theory (Corr, 2004), which states that the two systems
mutually inhibit each other. Thus, BIS-mediated inhibition of
approach motivation is equivalently reflected in reduced leftfrontal asymmetry as well as increased right-frontal asymmetry
in the context of EEG asymmetry scores (see also Coan and Allen,
2004).
Moreover, right-frontal EEG asymmetry has been found
to contribute to numerous neural and behavioral indicators
of anxious or inhibitory responding. For example, relative
right-frontal activity is positively associated with state anxiety
(Davidson et al., 2000; Harmon-Jones et al., 2009) and
hypervigilance to threat (Pérez-Edgar et al., 2013; Grimshaw
et al., 2014). It also predicts the amplitude of the error-related
negativity (Nash et al., 2012), which is linked to BIS sensitivity
(Boksem et al., 2006, 2008). Importantly, it has also been
demonstrated that right-frontal asymmetry is specifically related
to the anxious inhibitory state of passive avoidance, whereas
left-frontal asymmetry has been linked to the fearful state of
active avoidance (Wacker et al., 2008; see also Perkins et al.,
2007 for behavioral evidence on the fear/anxiety distinction).
Overall, there is a substantial body of evidence to support
the notion that right-frontal EEG asymmetry is associated
with numerous neural and behavioral indicators of anxious or
inhibitory responding (for more evidence, see Thibodeau et al.,
2006; Wacker et al., 2010; McNaughton et al., 2013). Convergent
evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
has also demonstrated a link between right-frontal brain activity
and anxiety (e.g., Dalton et al., 2005; Engels et al., 2010) and
inhibition (see Aron et al., 2004 for review).
Nash et al. (2010) demonstrated that BIS/BAS activity can also
be investigated using the line bisection task (LBT) as a perceptual
measure of relative prefrontal hemisphericity. The LBT gauges
BIS/BAS activity (or left-frontal asymmetry) by determining
the extent to which people’s perceptions of the midpoints of
horizontal lines are biased to the right visual field, mirroring
neural activity in the contralateral hemisphere (Nash et al., 2010).
Accordingly, reduced rightward line bisection bias (i.e., reduced
left or increased right hemisphericity) has been associated
with BIS-related phenomena, such as anxious-avoidant arousal
(Friedman and Förster, 2005), feelings of passivity/inhibition,
and powerlessness (Drake and Myers, 2006; Wilkinson et al.,
2010), as well as reduced risk taking, optimism, and goal pursuit
(Drake and Ulrich, 1992; Nash et al., 2011). Notably, line
bisection bias is specifically related to frontal (F7/F8) but not

The Present Research
In the present research, we examined the hypotheses that (a)
MS causes BIS activity, evidenced by increased by greater righthemispheric frontal asymmetry, (b) BIS activity mediates MS
effects on cultural closed-mindedness, and (c) these effects are
pronounced among persons with high NFC. Stated differently, we
tested the moderated mediational hypothesis that MS effects on
cultural closed-mindedness are mediated by BIS activity and are
particularly strong for persons with high NFC. These hypotheses
were examined by inducing MS (vs. a control topic), measuring
NFC, measuring frontal brain asymmetry via the LBT (Study 1)
and EEG (Study 2), and measuring cultural closed-mindedness in
the form of reluctance to engage with cultural novelty (Study 1)
and general ethnocentrism (Study 2). Moreover, in order to
substantiate our claim that inhibition is the mediator, we directly
manipulated the proposed mediator—inhibition—in Study 3 to
test whether inhibition evokes ethnocentric thinking for high
NFC persons (cf. Spencer et al., 2005).

STUDY 1
Study 1 was designed to test whether (a) persons with high
NFC respond with increased BIS activity (as assessed by LBTassessed right-frontal activity) to MS, and (b) their increased BIS
activity mediates their increased unwillingness to explore foreign
cultures.

Method
Participants and Design
Seventy-seven students at the University of Salzburg participated
in this paper-pencil study, which took place in class, prior to
a lecture3 . Three participants failed to follow instructions and
were dropped prior to analyses, leaving a final sample of 74
participants (54 females and 20 males). Their mean age was 22.0
years (SD = 1.8; range: 19–31). Participant nationalities were 54
German, 18 Austrian, and 2 other. Participants were randomly
assigned to one of two conditions, MS (N = 35) or TV salience
(N = 39), in a between-subjects design. The study was described
as an investigation of personality and visual perception. The
study was approved by the ethics committee of the University
of Salzburg. All participants signed informed consent, and could
withdraw participation at any point, although no participant
made use of this option.
3 Regarding sample size considerations, MS has an expected effect size of MS at
d = 0.75 on ethnocentrism and related outcomes (Burke et al., 2010). Thus, power
for a main effect is at 80% with a sample of n = 60. Given that a personality
moderator should add prediction to a model, power was expected to be well over
80% for the current studies. For example in the current research domain, Vess et al.
(2009) observed NFC × MS interaction effects on meaning in life in three studies
(1a–1c) with an average d = 0.90.

Procedure and Materials

avoidance, Study 1.

Need for Closure
Following instructions and the baseline LBT measure (described
in more detail below), the NFC scale was presented. We measured
NFC with three items that were taken from the German version
of the NFC scale (Webster and Kruglanski, 1994; Schlink and
Walther, 2007). The items were selected a priori based on
two criteria: First, representativeness of the whole NFC scale,
that is, corrected item-total correlations presented by Schlink
and Walther (2007). Second, the items that best capture the
willingness to approach/avoid novel and unpredictable stimuli
should be of particular relevance (Green and Campbell, 2000),
contrary to decisiveness, which is also encompassed by the NFC
scale (see also Neuberg et al., 1997 for a critique of the full NFC
scale’s conceptual imprecision). One item was dropped prior to
analyses because its corrected item-total correlation suggested it
was unrelated with the other two items in the current sample
(rit = 0.00). The two remaining items were: “I prefer familiar
things over unfamiliar and unpredictable ones” and “I don’t like
unpredictable situations” (interrelation: r = 0.53, p < 0.001). A
pilot study revealed this short NFC scale to correlate strongly
with the conceptually related personal need for structure scale
by Neuberg and Newsom (1993), r = 0.72, p < 0.001, N = 217.
Responses were given on a 1 (almost never) to 6 (almost always)
scale, and averaged to create a single composite score (M = 3.93,
SD = 0.85).

Avoidance of Cultural Novelty
Passive avoidance of cultural novelty was measured with eight
researcher-generated items designed to measure interest in
exploring culturally foreign stimuli (e.g., people, information).
Based on the conceptual view that exploration constitutes
approach behavior toward novel stimuli (Green and Campbell,
2000), and evidence implicating BIS activity in reduced
exploratory approach behaviors (Green and Campbell, 2000;
Elliot and Reis, 2003; Kashdan et al., 2004), we recoded our
cultural exploration items to obtain a measure for passive
avoidance of cultural novelty. Example items include “I would
like to get to know people from foreign cultures” and “I
am curious to learn how people live in foreign cultures4 .”
Participants were asked to indicate the extent to which the items
describe them at the present moment. Responses were given on
a 1 (very little) to 5 (very much) scale, and averaged to create a
single composite score (8 items; M = 2.40, SD = 0.80, α = 0.90).
After that, we included some newly created personality
items that were unrelated to an interest in exploring culturally
foreign stimuli, a newly created cross-cultural conflict resolution
task that included a manipulation, and a criterion variable for
explorative reasons. Finally, we collected some demographic data
and measured participants’ handedness (Oldfield, 1971).

Manipulation
After a few further personality items, included to bolster the
cover story, we presented the classic MS manipulation, asking
participants two open-ended questions about what will happen
to them physically when they die and after they are dead,
and which emotions are caused by thinking about their own
death. Participants in the control condition were asked parallel
questions about watching TV.

Results
Threat × NFC on Cultural Novelty Avoidance and
Avoidance Motivation
As an initial step we sought to confirm that MS heightens
avoidance of cultural otherness especially at high NFC. For this,
effect-coded threat (with zero as the non-threat and one as
the threat condition), NFC, and the threat × NFC term were
entered as predictors of cultural avoidance. Results are displayed
in Table 1. Both the main effects of threat and NFC were
significant. These main effects were qualified by the predicted
interaction (1R2 = 0.06) such that avoidance of cultural novelty
was especially high under MS vs. control for people high (+1
SD) on NFC [b = 0.59, SE = 0.26, t (70) = 2.28, p = 0.025, see
Figure 1]. There was no effect of threat at low NFC (−1 SD), b =
−0.26, SE = 0.26, t (70) = 1.09, p = 0.277.
Next, we tested our key hypothesis that MS causes BIS
activity—as indicated by a shift in leftward bisection bias—for
persons with high NFC (the mediator model). In line with prior
research using the LBT and to control for hemispheric differences
arising from handedness (e.g., Drake and Myers, 2006), we

Line Bisection Task (Inhibition of Approach
Motivation)
Following a free-thought delay of a few minutes, the LBT was
presented for a second time (the first LBT was presented right at
the beginning of the study to obtain a baseline LBT measure). In
each measure, participants were instructed to mark the perceived
center point of eight horizontal lines that ranged from 4 to 6 (102
to 152 mm) in length with their centers offset from each other (see
also Drake and Myers, 2006, who used the same LBT). Estimation
errors to the left reflect an overnoticing of the left visual field
characteristic of relative right cerebral hemisphericity (Jewell
and McCourt, 2000). Thus, we computed the index of relative
right cerebral hemisphericity by subtracting each participant’s
number of right-of-center ticks from left-of-center ticks (see
McGregor et al., 2010, Study 1). In line with prior research, both
LBT measures were correlated, r = 0.67, p < 0.001 (McGregor
et al., 2010), and participants exhibited a leftward bisection bias
on average (LBT 1: M = 1.92, SD = 4.12; LBT 2: M = 1.10,
SD = 3.80; Jewell and McCourt, 2000).

contrast to Vess et al. (2009) who used Green and Campbell’s (2000)

their exploration scale largely lacks explicit reference to culturally foreign stimuli.

Brief Discussion
These results provide the first evidence for the notion that (a) MS
leads to increases in BIS activity, (b) BIS activity mediates MS
effects on aversion to cultural novelty, and (c) these effects are
particular to people high on NFC. Thus, the findings demonstrate
that a basic, passive-avoidance motivational process underlies
higher-order manifestations of behavioral inhibition, such as
the reluctance to explore unfamiliar cultures. This dynamic was
only present for high NFC individuals, suggesting that they
are particularly inclined to avoid the terror of death through
motivated closed-mindedness toward cultural otherness.
One limitation of the current study was that our cultural
novelty-avoidance measure had not been used prior to the study,
so its construct validity was questionable. We thus conducted a
follow-up study to explore the relationship between this measure
and a frequent operationalization of cultural worldview defense.
We found that the cultural novelty-avoidance measure used in
Study 1 correlated with a measure of general ethnocentrism,
r(30) = 0.37, p = 0.037. This ethnocentrism measure has been
used as a worldview defense measure in prior TMT research
(Agroskin and Jonas, 2013), and found to be related to NFC
(Agroskin and Jonas, 2010). Thus, our cultural novelty-avoidance
items may at least partly tap into those destructive aspects of
ethnocentric intergroup bias that are characteristic of cultural
worldview defense.
Study 1 provided strong initial support for the proposition
that MS activates the BIS particularly in high NFC people, which
explains their post-threat closed-mindedness. However, we used
a fairly indirect measure of frontal asymmetry measured via the
LBT. In Study 2, we turned to a more direct measure of frontal

excluded 16 left-handed individuals from all analyses involving
the LBT (Oldfield, 1971). Furthermore, the LBT baseline measure
was entered as a predictor in all analyses including the LBT;
thus, effects on LBT can be considered demonstrations of residual
change. Baseline LBT, effect-coded threat, NFC, and the threat
× NFC interaction were entered as predictors of post-threat
LBT. As displayed in Table 2, there were no main effects, and
the threat × NFC interaction was significant (1R2 = 0.060).
Avoidance of cultural novelty was especially high under MS
vs. control for people high on NFC, though this effect did not
emerge until very high values of NFC (∼+2 SD or the 95%
of our observed distribution according to the Johnson-Neyman
technique, 1936). There was an unpredicted effect of threat at low
NFC (−1 SD), b = −2.42, SE = 1.11, t (53) = 2.17, p = 0.034.
Figure 2 shows that the effect of NFC on bisection bias under MS
reversed from control such that NFC predicted more avoidance
under MS.

Test of Moderated Mediation
Next, we tested whether BIS activity transmits or explains the
effect of the interaction of MS and NFC to cultural avoidance.
Because NFC is linked to both sensitivity to threat and motivated
closed-mindedness under threat, it was allowed to moderate both
the path from the threat to the mediator, as well as from the
mediator to the dependent variable (i.e., model 58; Hayes, 2013).

associated with literature and personality. They were rewarded
with course credits. The study was approved by the ethics
committee of the University of Salzburg. All participants signed
informed consent, and could withdraw participation at any point,
although no participant made use of this option.

STUDY 2

Procedure and Materials

Building on Study 1, Study 2 employed a poem-based MS
manipulation (Agroskin and Jonas, 2013), the full NFC scale
(Schlink and Walther, 2007), and frontal EEG alpha asymmetry
instead of the LBT as a more direct measure of BIS-related
neural activity. We also used the general ethnocentrism measure
from the follow-up study instead of cultural novelty-avoidance
to tap into the destructive aspects of cultural closed-mindedness
that often characterize worldview-defensive negativity toward
cultural outgroups. Summing up, Study 2 was designed to
provide multimethodological and conceptual replication for the
findings of Study 1.

Need for Closure
Prior to coming to the lab for the EEG measurement, participants
were emailed and asked to fill out a few online questionnaires,
including the whole NFC scale (Schlink and Walther, 2007)
whose short form was used in Study 18 . Responses were given
on a 1 (totally disagree) to 6 (totally agree) scale, and averaged to
create a single composite score (14 items; M = 3.23, SD = 0.70,
α = 0.82)9 .

Manipulation
Upon arriving at the lab, participants were asked to provide some
demographic data. After that, they underwent a 90-s baseline
EEG recording (see below for more detail). Then, they were
presented a short poem related to death or a neutral control
topic (weather). The death-related poem has been used as a
MS manipulation before (Agroskin and Jonas, 2013, Study 2).
Literally translated from German, it reads “The hardest and
cruelest power, which man has to accept, is death.” The weatherrelated poem reads “Look to the sky, clouds are passing by. Some
are raining, others are not. Some are flashing, others are not.”
Participants were asked to read the poem and describe how they
interpret it, what they associate with it (e.g., images, sounds,
smells, and moods), whether they have experienced anything in
their own lives that showed them that the poem was true, and

Method
Participants and Design
The sample consisted of 33 participants (23 female) from
the University of Salzburg without any reported history of
neurological disorders or prior head trauma5 . Their mean
age was 22.1 years (SD = 3.0; range: 18–32)6 . Twenty-two
participants held German and eleven Austrian nationalities.
Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions,
MS (N = 16) or TV salience (N = 17), in a between-subjects
design7 . All participants gave written informed consent to
5 Due

to the intensive nature of EEG data collection and analysis, collection was
stopped after reaching an n of 15 per cell plus 10% for anticipated data loss.
6 Age was unequally distributed across experimental conditions. Participants were
significantly younger in the MS condition (M = 20.4, SD = 1.93) than in the
control condition (M = 23.7, SD = 2.91), t (31) = 3.78, p < 0.001. We included
age as a covariate in all analyses reported below. Running the analysis without this
covariate did not impact the status of the significance tests or the substance of the
conclusions.
7 This study was part of a larger project that included other experimental conditions
for exploratory reasons. Specifically, conditions not reported here were presented
with other poems about existential topics that did not refer to the subject of death

Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org

and that were not designed as neutral control conditions either. Given that this
study was primarily designed as a conceptual replication of Study 1, we present
only the analyses that concern the MS and neutral control conditions.
8 In addition to the 33 participants reported above, nine more persons participated
in the EEG study but failed to complete the personality questionnaires. They were
dropped from all analyses.
9 Two items were dropped prior to analyses because of very low corrected itemtotal correlations (rit s < 0.20).

FC6, P7, T7, T8, P8, O1, and O2 in accordance with the
10–20 International System. Two mastoid electrodes served as
online reference. The Emotiv EEG neuroheadset employs goldplated contact-grade hardened copper electrodes with salinemoistened felt pads to record EEG. Importantly, the Emotiv
EEG device has been found to record similar suppression of
alpha power (8–13 Hz) in the Left Precentral AAL (Automated
Anatomical Labeling) region in response to imagined rightfinger tapping trials as compared to a standard Biosemi ActiveII 64-channel device (see also Stopczynski et al., 2014a,b). This
suggests that the Emotiv device is suitable for investigating
neural processes associated with regional changes in alpha
power. Further, validation studies determined that when used
no longer than about 60 min per recording session, the
ERP signal quality produced by this device is comparable to
(or only slightly lower than) the signal quality provided by
traditional EEG systems (Badcock et al., 2013; Mayaud et al.,
2013). Consequently, Emotiv EEG technology has recently
been increasingly used for cognitive neuroscience and braincomputer interface (BCI) applications (Bobrov et al., 2011;
Debener et al., 2012; Louwerse and Hutchinson, 2012; Choi
and Jo, 2013; Khushaba et al., 2013; O’Regan et al., 2013;
O’Regan and Marnane, 2013; De Vos et al., 2014; Vourvopoulos
and Liarokapis, 2014; Aspinall et al., 2015; Steinhubl et al.,
2015).
Using BrainVision Analyzer 2.0 (Brain Products, Gilching,
Germany), EEG data were filtered with an IIR filter (highpass cutoff: 0.1 Hz, Slope: 24 db/Oct; low-pass cutoff: 30
Hz, Slope: 24 db/Oct). Next, the three 90-s EEG recording
epochs were extracted from the continuous data and were
further segmented into 2s segments (1.5s overlap). Epochs
were included in condition averages when a difference
between two values in a moving 200 ms interval did not
exceed 100 microvolt, or when the signal was below −100 or
above +100 microvolt. The 2s segments were then Fourier
transformed (Fast Fourier Transform, 10% Hamming Window,
frequency resolution 0.5 Hz) and the resulting power spectra
were averaged. Individual frontal asymmetry scores (µV2 )
for each epoch were calculated (log F7–log F8) in the
alpha band (8–13 Hz) and exported for statistical analysis.
Positive values index right-frontal hemisphericity indicative
of avoidance motivation. Analyses focused on lateral frontal
asymmetry (F7–F8) because these electrodes have been
specifically linked to bisection bias in the LBT (Nash et al.,
2010).

whether their own existence had certain aspects reflecting the
veracity of the poem. These questions were used to help ensure
a deep and thorough processing of the poems and their meaning.

EEG (Inhibition of Approach Motivation)
Right after the manipulation, participants underwent another
90-s EEG recording in order to assess post-threat avoidance
motivation as a function of MS. During all EEG recordings
participants were asked to fixate a small black cross in the middle
of the screen. After this EEG measurement, participants filled
out the 20-item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS;
Watson et al., 1988). Then, participants underwent one more 90-s
EEG recording.

Ethnocentrism
Following a delay of a few minutes (involving questions about
which TV programs participants would like to watch and
their reactions to two press reports about crimes10 ), which is
necessary to obtain MS effects following explicit MS inductions
(Pyszczynski et al., 1999), general ethnocentrism was measured
using a short form of the ethnocentrism scale by Bizumic et al.
(2009). This short form has been previously used by Agroskin and
Jonas (2013) as a measure of cultural worldview defense, and was
found to be associated with NFC, right-wing authoritarianism,
avoidance of empathy, and anti-immigration attitudes (Agroskin
and Jonas, 2010). Sample items are “In most circumstances it is
right and natural to favor members from one’s own cultural or
ethnic group over strangers or foreigners” and “We need to do
what’s best for our own people, and stop worrying so much about
what the effect might be on other peoples.” Responses were given
on a 1 (totally disagree) to 6 (totally agree) scale, and averaged to
create a single composite score (4 items; M = 2.10, SD = 0.91,
α = 0.71)11 .
Then, for exploratory reasons, participants underwent
another 90 s EEG recording trial and completed some questions
about their attitudes toward the European currency. Finally, they
indicated their nationality and were probed for suspicion. Our
focal BIS-related hypotheses were not correctly guessed by any
participant12 .

EEG Apparatus and Data Reduction
We used a 14-channel Emotiv EEG neuroheadset (Emotiv
Systems Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA), recording data with
Emotiv TestBench software at a sampling rate of 128 Hz. EEG
data was recorded at sites AF3, AF4, F3, F4, F7, F8, FC5,
10 The

press reports described crimes committed in Austria (or by Austrians).
Then, participants’ intentions to punish the perpetrators were measured. Given
that 66.7% of our participants were Germans, we could not analyze their
punishment intentions in response to Austrian crimes as indicators of their
ethnocentric, worldview-defensive attitudes (cf. Rosenblatt et al., 1989). We also
included four items measuring worldview-defensive prejudice toward immigrants
(Agroskin and Jonas, 2010) right after the focal ethnocentrism measure (see
below), which were not analyzed for the same reason (i.e., most of our participants
were immigrants themselves).
11 Two items were dropped prior to analyses because of very low corrected
item-total correlations (rit s < 0.20).
12 Two participants mentioned death-related thoughts and ethnocentric attitudes,
though. Dropping these two participants did not substantially change the results
reported below, which is why we kept them in the final sample.

Results
Preliminary Analyses
Frontal asymmetry scores (L – R alpha) for the proximal and
distal recordings were baseline adjusted for each participant so
that they reflected changes in asymmetry, following past research
on state frontal alpha asymmetry (e.g., Allen et al., 2001; Ravaja
et al., 2013). The resultant asymmetry scores for the proximal
and distal recordings were highly correlated, r = 0.63, p < 0.001.
Given that Jonas et al. (2014) assume anxious persons to show
prolonged BIS activity following threat, and NFC is known to
affect proximal and distal MS effects in a similar way (Juhl and

NFC and BIS in Ethnocentrism

EEG-Inhibition Effect on Ethnocentrism
Right-frontal asymmetry was entered as a predictor in addition
to the manipulation and NFC. The interaction between the
manipulation and NFC (i.e., direct interactive effect) was fixed
to zero because we assumed a complete mediation model
(Shrout and Bolger, 2002). As expected, right-frontal asymmetry
predicted ethnocentrism, b = 2.49, SE = 0.69, β = 0.54, t (29)
= 3.59, p < 0.001. No other relationships attained significance
(ps > 0.34). In contrast to Study 1, adding the interaction
between right-frontal asymmetry and NFC did not reveal
moderation by NFC, t (27) = −0.62, p = 0.53. Thus, BIS activity
affected ethnocentrism regardless of NFC levels. We thus fixed
the effect of NFC to zero in accordance with Hayes (2013, Model
7) for the moderated mediational analyses. Summing up, the
more participants had right-frontal asymmetry, the more they
adopted ethnocentric attitudes. Our hypotheses were therefore
supported.

Routledge, 2010), we merged the proximal and distal asymmetry
scores.

Bootstrap Estimation of the Indirect Effects
As per bias-corrected bootstrap procedure using 75000 bootstrap
samples (Hayes, 2013, Model 7, see Figure 5), MS significantly
increased ethnocentrism through right-frontal asymmetry for
high NFC persons, point estimate (b) = 0.67, 95% CI [0.02, 1.43].
In contrast, there was no conditional indirect effect for low NFC
persons, b = −0.15, 95% CI [−0.84, 0.33].
Finally, the overall model test was consistent with our
hypothesis of complete mediation (Hayes, 2013, Model 7),
2 = 0.65, p = 0.72, CFI = 1.00. Thus, our key mediational
χ(2)
hypothesis for high NFC individuals was supported: MS
amplified ethnocentric thinking via the BIS-based inhibition of
approach motivation14 .

Primary Analyses
Analytical Strategy
As in Study 1, the hypotheses were tested in several steps
using moderated mediational analyses (Hayes, 2013) performed
using Mplus 7 (Muthén and Muthén, 2012). The zero-order
correlations are not explicitly reported because they were
virtually identical (i.e., same directions and similar magnitudes
and significance levels) with the respective main effects reported
below13 .

MS × NFC Effect on EEG-Inhibition

Discussion

First, we tested whether individuals with high NFC showed
higher right-frontal (or reduced left-frontal) asymmetry
following MS (coded as MS = 1, weather = 0) by regressing
the post-threat asymmetry score onto pre-threat asymmetry,
threat, NFC, and the threat × NFC interaction. There was no
effect of NFC in the control condition, b = −0.05, SE = 0.06,
t (28) = 0.78, p = 0.443 and a significant main effect of threat
such that avoidance was higher under MS than control, b = 0.69,
SE = 0.31, t (28) = 2.23, p = 0.025. This effect was qualified by
a significant interaction between the manipulation and NFC,
b = 0.24, SE = 0.09, β = 0.43, t (28) = 2.56, p = 0.01, 1R2 =
0.16 (see Figure 4). Simple effects analyses revealed that high
NFC individuals (SD = 1) showed the predicted increase in
right-frontal asymmetry following MS, b = 0.27, SE = 0.10,
β = 0.69, t (28) = 2.64, p < 0.01, whereas this was not true for
low NFC persons (SD = −1), b = −0.06, SE = 0.10, β = −0.16,
t (28) = −0.65, p = 0.52. Thus, our hypotheses were corroborated:
MS increased BIS-based inhibition of approach motivation but
only for high NFC persons.

These results replicate and expand the findings from Study 1
in several important ways. First, they provide a more direct
measure of right-frontal asymmetric activity in the prefrontal
cortex via EEG. Second, they involve another operationalization
of motivated closed-mindedness in the cultural domain—
generalized ethnocentric attitudes—which suggests that a similar
process may underlie various forms of worldview defense. All in
all, the findings are clearly supportive of the view that high NFC
persons’ approach motivation is strongly inhibited following
mortality reminders, which underlies their inclination to engage
in ethnocentric thinking.
In Study 3, we aimed at conceptually replicating the effect of
BIS-related inhibition on ethnocentrism by directly manipulating
inhibition. Further, this test provides another means of testing
14 All critical effects stayed significant using non-bootstrapped coefficients,
including the conditional indirect effect for high NFC, b = 0.69, SE = 0.33,
t = 2.10, p < 0.05. However, although the point estimate for the indirect effect
was even somewhat increased, the bootstrap estimates became less robust, b =
0.69, 90% CI [0.05, 1.54], 95% CI [−0.11, 1.73]. This may be due to reduced
degrees of freedom. Note, that the same pattern occurred when computing the
model without the PANAS using listwise deletion instead of FIML, which likewise
reduced degrees of freedom, b = 0.62, SE = 0.31, t = 2.04, p < 0.05 (non-bootstrap
test), b = 0.62, 90% CI [0.04, 1.23], 95% CI [−0.11, 1.34] (bootstrap test; see also
footnote 16). The results were virtually unchanged after controlling for the PANAS
scales.

13 Four

participants had missing data in either the proximal or the distal EEG
measurement. All reported analyses have been run with the whole sample using
Full-Information-Maximum Likelihood (FIML) parameters in Mplus 7 (Muthén
and Muthén, 2012). However, excluding the participants with missing data using
listwise deletion did not change the results substantially (see also footnote 15 ).

for mediation by manipulating the proposed mediator (Spencer

Need for Closure
Because the two-item NFC measure used in Study 1 was shown
to be sensitive to MS, we measured NFC with same two items
(M = 3.77, SD = 0.85; r = 0.44, p < 0.001).

STUDY 3

Manipulation

In Study 3, we employed an experimental approach to testing
mediation by manipulating the assumed mediator—inhibition.
Building on research on disinhibition by van den Bos et al.
(2009), we developed a novel manipulation of inhibition to test
whether bringing people into a state of inhibition produces the
same ethnocentric bias as threat and BIS activity. Thus, we
measured NFC, induced inhibition, and measured ethnocentrism
with the same instrument as in Study 2. In addition, we included
a BIS affect measure as a manipulation check. We expected
inhibition to promote ethnocentric thinking for persons with
high NFC.

After a few further personality items, included to bolster the cover
story, we presented a novel manipulation of inhibition. Building
on the disinhibition manipulation from van den Bos et al.
(2009), we asked participants three open-ended questions about
behaving with inhibitions: “Please briefly describe a situation out
of your own life in which you felt and behaved in an inhibited
way like you typically do.” In the next two questions, we asked
participants how they behaved and felt in this situation. In the
control condition, we posed the same three questions referring
to their behaving in a normal way (cf. van den Bos et al., 2009):
“Please briefly describe a situation out of your own life in which
you felt and behaved in a normal way like you typically do.” The
other two questions referred to participants’ behavior and feelings
again.

Method
Participants and Design
Seventy-six students at the University of Salzburg participated
in this paper-pencil study, which took place in class, after
a lecture15 . Participants were 58 females, 15 males, and 3
undisclosed. Their mean age was 21.6 years (SD = 2.0;
range: 19–30). Fifty-five participants held German, 17 Austrian,
and 1 another nationality (3 undisclosed). Participants were
randomly assigned to one of two conditions, inhibition
(N = 36), or control (N = 40), in a between-subjects
design. The study was described as an investigation of
participants’ personalities. The study was approved by the
ethics committee of the University of Salzburg. All participants
signed informed consent, and could withdraw participation
at any point, although no participant made use of this
option.

Ethnocentrism
Ethnocentrism was measured in the same way as in Study 2 (4
items; M = 1.94, SD = 0.77, α = 0.60)16 .

BIS Affect
Following Schumann et al. (2014), we included a retrospective
manipulation check asking about how participants felt when
responding to the inhibition/control condition-related questions.
We presented five items measuring BIS-related affect, including
four adjectives from the German translation of the Carver
and White (1994) BIS sensitivity scale (Strobel et al., 2001),
namely nervous (German: nervös), anxious (ängstlich), worked
up (unruhig), and worried (besorgt), along with the face-valid
16 After

the ethnocentrism items, we included four items measuring prejudice
toward immigrants (Agroskin and Jonas, 2010). These items were included as
another measure of an ethnocentric, worldview-defensive attitude but were not
analyzed because 75% of participants of this study were technically immigrants
themselves (i.e., Germans studying in Austria).

15 With

respect to the stopping rule for data collection in this study, we aimed
at recruiting the same amount of participants as in Study 1, distributing
questionnaires to all students who attended a lecture that is usually attended by
about 80 people.

notwithstanding the PANAS, F (1, 65) = 49.64, p < 0.001, η2 =

(not at all) to 5 (extremely). Finally, participants completed
the PANAS (Watson et al., 1988) and some demographic
questions17 .

Results
Inhibition × NFC on Ethnocentrism
To examine whether high NFC persons respond with increased
ethnocentrism to the inhibition recall-task, we used moderated
regression analyses18 . Whereas, there were no significant main
effects (ps > 0.14), the interaction between the manipulation
(coded as inhibition = 1, control = 0) and NFC was significant,
b = 0.49, SE = 0.21, β = 0.27, t (69) = 2.38, p < 0.02, 1R2 = 0.07
(see Figure 6). As predicted, high NFC individuals (SD = 1)
showed significantly increased ethnocentrism following MS,
b = 0.59, SE = 0.24, β = 0.39, t (69) = 2.41, p < 0.05, whereas
this was not true for low NFC persons (SD = −1), b = −0.24,
SE = 0.25, β = −0.16, t (69) = −0.98, p = 0.33. Thus, our
hypotheses were corroborated: inhibition caused ethnocentrism
in high NFC persons, whereas low NFC persons were not affected
by inhibition in this way.

Exploratory Analyses: BIS Affect × NFC on
Ethnocentrism
For the sake of convergent validity, we explored whether BIS
affect elicited ethnocentrism for high NFC persons similar to
the inhibition manipulation. We also controlled for the PANAS
scales to rule out the possibility that the effect of BIS affect could
be explained by mood more generally. There was a marginally
significant main effect of BIS affect, b = 0.17, SE = 0.10, β = 0.32,
t (65) = 1.69, p < 0.10, all other ps > 0.22. Moreover, a significant
interaction between BIS affect and NFC occurred, b = 0.24,
SE = 0.09, β = 0.39, t (65) = 2.73, p < 0.01, 1R2 = 0.09
(see Figure 7). As predicted, high NFC individuals showed
significantly increased ethnocentrism following MS, b = 0.36,
SE = 0.12, β = 0.66, t (65) = 3.04, p < 0.01, whereas this
was not true for low NFC persons, b = −40.05, SE = 0.13,
β = −0.11, t (65) = −0.43, p = 0.67. Again, the PANAS scales
did not affect ethnocentrism (ps > 0.21). Thus, BIS affect
evoked ethnocentrism for high NFC persons in the same way as
inhibition, and this effect was independent of changes in mood.

BIS Affect (Manipulation Check)
As expected, BIS affect was significantly higher in the inhibition
condition (M = 3.63, SD = 1.24) than in the control condition
(M = 1.32, SD = 0.47), t (35.40) = 9.65, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.6319 .

PANAS
Mood was also affected by inhibition. Negative affect was
significantly increased and positive affect was significantly
decreased by inhibition, ts > 2.91, ps < 0.01. Therefore, we
reanalyzed the inhibition effect on BIS affect including the
PANAS scales as covariates. Inhibition still increased BIS affect

Discussion
These results constitute an important conceptual replication
of the relationship between BIS activity and ethnocentric
thinking. Manipulating inhibition, the proposed mediator of
MS effects on ethnocentrism, provided further support for the
proposition that inhibition plays a causal role in generating
ethnocentrism following MS. Persons with high NFC responded

17 The

negative mood scale included only eight instead of ten items because the
items anxious and nervous were included in the BIS affect measure.
18 Three participants failed to complete the ethnocentrism measure.
19 Seven participants failed to complete the BIS affect and PANAS measures. We
also used the adjusted degrees of freedom because variances were not equal as
indicated by a significant Levene’s test (p < 0.001).

NFC and BIS in Ethnocentrism

it largely remains an empirical question to what extent inhibition
processes drive other forms of worldview defense given that
inhibition has yet to be thoroughly tested as a mediator in this
regard. Future research should sample the conceptual space of
worldview defense more broadly to examine the generality of
the process we present On a related note, it also remains to
be seen whether approach-related cognition can alleviate the
passive avoidance observed here and prevent negative effects of
MS on desirable outcomes, like creativity (Sligte et al., 2013).
The findings may also advance research on threat and defense
in that they suggest that various responses to threat that are not
obviously or intuitively related to a lack of approach motivation
may be attributed to the approach-inhibitory activity of the BIS.
These advances also have important implications for inspiring
research on the defensive function of BIS anxiety, which
originates from ethological research on animals’ responses to
threat (Gray and McNaughton, 2000). It has been argued
that “there are long-standing concerns that rodent models of
psychological processes are too simple to apply in humans
(Matthews, 2008): For example, there is no evidence that rodents
experience anxiety of an abstract type related to existential issues,
whereas historical and literary accounts abundantly point to the
existence of such angst in humans. Concerns of this type have
raised a need for studies of human defense that can test the
validity of the defensive explanation for anxiety in humans”
(Perkins and Corr, 2014, pp. 42–43). Our findings show that
rodent models of BIS anxiety can indeed be applied to defensive
behaviors in the wake of threat in humans and point toward the
possibility of a more consilient science of motivation.
On the whole, our findings provide valuable insight
into contextual, interindividual, motivational, and neural
determinants of cultural closed-mindedness. To our knowledge,
this research is the first to establish an empirical link between
very basic, neurally instantiated inhibitory processes and rather
complex, higher-order manifestations of intergroup negativity.
By investigating the neural and motivational underpinnings
of ethnocentric attitudes in the wake of existential threat, this
research might contribute to a fuller understanding of cultural
worldview defensive phenomena, among the most investigated
outcomes in social psychology over the last 25 years (Burke et al.,
2010).

with increased ethnocentrism to not only induced inhibition
but also experiences of BIS-related affect. These results provide
important multimethod evidence for the notion that not only
perceptual and neural (Studies 1–2) but also cognitive-affective
indicators of BIS-mediated inhibition can provoke ethnocentric
thinking, and these effects are particularly strong for persons with
high NFC.

GENERAL DISCUSSION
In this paper, we have presented evidence from three studies
that shed light on several previously uninvestigated questions
that have recently gathered much attention in the existential
threat literature (Tritt et al., 2012; Jonas et al., 2014). We found
that (a) MS causes BIS activity, as indexed by right-hemispheric
asymmetric activation in the frontal cortex (measured by the
LBT in Study 1 and EEG in Study 2), (b) BIS activity mediates
MS effects on cultural closed-mindedness (operationalized
as reluctance to explore foreign cultures in Study 1 and
ethnocentrism in Studies 2 and 3), and (c) these effects are
particularly strong for persons inclined to experience discomfort
when faced with unfamiliar and potentially threatening stimuli
(measured by NFC in all studies). In addition, Study 3
conceptually replicated the first two studies by showing that
directly manipulating inhibition promotes ethnocentric thinking
for high NFC persons in a manner similar to right-frontal
asymmetry. To our knowledge, these results are the first to
demonstrate that MS-based aversion to cultural otherness is
driven by a very basic, neurally-instantiated inhibitory process.

Theoretical Implications
The findings have important implications for understanding the
neural and motivational underpinnings of ethnocentric attitudes
in response to existential threat. They provide the first direct
support for the hypothesis that inhibitory processes, as indicated
by relative right-hemispheric activity, underlie MS effects on
ethnocentric thinking, which is a key aspect of worldview defense.
This mediational finding is consistent with the process model
of threat and defense, which states that defensive responses to
threat are driven by passive avoidance motivation, for which the
BIS is primarily responsible (Jonas et al., 2014). This is also in
line with the assumption of TMT that ethnocentric responses to
MS constitute “avoidant defenses,” which are aimed at avoiding
experiencing existential anxiety (Greenberg et al., 2003, p. 519).
Moreover, our results are exactly in line with Greenberg et al.’s
(2003) speculation that these defenses might be mediated by
“a relative increase in right-hemisphere frontal lobe activity”
(Greenberg et al., 2003, p. 519). On a general level, our findings
may advance and refine TMT research in that they show that
MS can not only promote various BIS-related behaviors (Landau
and Greenberg, 2006; Routledge et al., 2010; Huang and Wyer,
2015), but also that cultural closed-mindedness can be explained
through very basic inhibitory processes.
To be clear, we are not suggesting that all manifestations of
worldview defense in response to MS are driven by inhibitory
processes based on the current observations. Although, this
would follow from the general process model (Jonas et al., 2014),
our results can only speak to cultural closed-mindedness. Thus,

LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
We used an indirect measure of BIS activity in Studies 1 and
2. Following theoretical and empirical research relating reduced
left-frontal asymmetry (or increased right-frontal asymmetry)
to BIS-mediated inhibition of approach motivation, we used
perceptual and neural indicators of frontal asymmetry to gauge
BIS activity (e.g., Davidson et al., 2000; Coan and Allen, 2004;
Corr, 2004; Harmon-Jones et al., 2009; Nash et al., 2010). To
provide more direct evidence for the role of inhibition in the
emergence of ethnocentric thinking, we directly manipulated
inhibition in Study 3, finding increased ethnocentrism for high
NFC persons following experiences of inhibition and BIS-related
affect. In combination, these studies yield support for BIS-driven
ethnocentrism in the wake of existential threat. Further, we have
other lines of converging evidence for the notion that perceptual

NFC and BIS in Ethnocentrism

CONCLUSION

and neural indicators of right-frontal asymmetry reflect BIS
activity (Agroskin and Jonas, 2015; Agroskin et al., 2015). For
instance, we have found in four EEG and LBT studies that
directly boosting/blocking BIS anxiety leads to increased/reduced
right-frontal asymmetry following MS (and also without MS).
Mirroring increased BIS affect following induced inhibition
(Study 3), we have also found amplified BIS affect following MS.
In summary, accumulating, multi-method evidence supports the
notion that threat-induced anxious inhibition (BIS activity) is a
cause of ethnocentric thinking.
Future research might consider an intriguing existential
interpretation of the avoidance—approach motivational systems.
According to TMT, avoidance—approach conflicts may reflect
the duality between the core motives for self-protective defense
(avoidance motivation) and self-expansive growth (approach
motivation; Greenberg et al., 1995a; Pyszczynski et al., 2000,
2012). From this perspective, closed-minded persons engage
in novelty-avoidant defense of the “familiar” in response
to mortality awareness, whereas open-minded individuals
approach the “unfamiliar,” expanding the self by gaining new
experiences. Future research may investigate to what extent these
motivational tendencies mediate MS effects on various behavioral
manifestations of the defense and growth motives, such as
support of extreme military action against cultural outgroups
(defense motive), and commitment to important life goals that
convey a sense of existential meaning (growth motive; Greenberg
et al., 1995a; Pyszczynski et al., 2012; see Vail et al., 2012 for a
review of growth-oriented MS effects).
Another avenue for future research might be to investigate
further neural underpinnings of ethnocentric attitudes following
MS. Along with the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the
BIS may be subserved by the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC;
McNaughton and Corr, 2004). In addition to generating
neural signals of error-related distress (ERN) and anxiety (see
Shackman et al., 2011 for a review), the ACC contributes to
risk aversion in decision making (Brown and Braver, 2007).
This suggests that the ACC may also support risk-avoidant
behaviors after MS, such as the ethnocentric avoidance of cultural
outgroups. Future research might shed some more light on
previously unexamined neural mediators of terror management
mechanisms.

Becker (1997) saw man as a “terrified, death-avoiding animal”
(p. 99) that, by seeking to avoid death, kills off “so large a
spectrum of his action-world that he is actually isolating and
diminishing himself and becomes as though dead” (Becker,
1997, p. 181). Psychiatrist Joseph Rheingold arrived at the same
conclusion: “The common denominator of all negative ways of
dealing with anxiety is a shrinking of the area of awareness
and of activity. (...) We are afraid to die, and therefore we
are afraid to live, (...) we avoid non-being by avoiding being.
The avoidance of anxiety then means a kind of death in life”
(Rheingold, 1967, pp. 204–205). These insightful analyses shed
light on a fascinating irony inherent in human striving for
self-preservation, or in terms of terror management, a life
free from consciously experienced death anxiety (Greenberg
et al., 2003). In trying to avoid death, people actually avoid
life, given that exploring (cultural) novelty contributes to
various indicators of well-being, including subjective vitality
and satisfaction with life (Kashdan et al., 2004). Our findings
represent the first neural evidence, to our knowledge, that this
existential ironical twist is driven by an ancient motivational
system, oriented toward passively avoiding punishment from
the environment. By symbolically avoiding the punishment of
death, people in reality obtain the punishment of an unlived
life.
