Abstract: Personality is the characteristic set of an individual’s behavioral and emotional patterns
that evolve from biological and environmental factors. The recognition of personality profiles is
crucial in making human–computer interaction (HCI) applications realistic, more focused, and user
friendly. The ability to recognize personality using neuroscientific data underpins the neurobiological
basis of personality. This paper aims to automatically recognize personality, combining scalp
electroencephalogram (EEG) and machine learning techniques. As the resting state EEG has not so
far been proven efficient for predicting personality, we used EEG recordings elicited during emotion
processing. This study was based on data from the AMIGOS dataset reflecting the response of
37 healthy participants. Brain networks and graph theoretical parameters were extracted from cleaned
EEG signals, while each trait score was dichotomized into low- and high-level using the k-means
algorithm. A feature selection algorithm was used afterwards to reduce the feature-set size to the best
10 features to describe each trait separately. Support vector machines (SVM) were finally employed
to classify each instance. Our method achieved a classification accuracy of 83.8% for extraversion,
86.5% for agreeableness, 83.8% for conscientiousness, 83.8% for neuroticism, and 73% for openness.

1. Introduction
Our work as well as our entertainment, communications, health, security, and education are
mainly driven by the advancements made in technology [1]. The way that each user interacts with
the computer is affected by his/her personality, which is defined as a relatively stable disposition
of an individual that influences his/her behavior [2]. Within this context, researchers have focused
their attention on the prediction of personality traits using data collected from online social media,
such as Twitter or Facebook [3,4]. Within this scenario, the creation of engaging interfaces, despite the
individual differences of the users, has become a challenging goal in the field of human computing
interaction (HCI) [1], giving rise to a new field called personality computing [5]. In addition to the

aforementioned applications, the recognition of personality using neuroscientific data underpins the
neurobiological basis of personality. This modern field of research, which is focused on the relationship
between personality traits and cerebral activity [6], is called personality neuroscience [7,8]. A vast
amount of behavioral and biological research on personality has raised several theories defining the
psychological functions associated with each one of main five personality dimensions [7,9].
The assessment of personality traits based on electroencephalographic (EEG) data in resting-state
is far from conclusive. Some studies have reported that resting state EEG can successfully assess
personality traits [10], while others have concluded that resting-state EEG spectral power cannot
be used to understand the neurobiological substrates of personality [11]. In contrast, other studies
have reported that the spectral power of brain oscillations in different frequency bands may serve
as a measure of personality [12–17]. Most of the research done with EEG has been focused on the
relationships between personality traits and EEG alpha activity [14]. However, other studies also
support the role of low EEG frequencies (delta and theta activity) in personality traits [15].
Although all these studies have attempted to link personality with resting state EEG using statistical
inference, none of them managed to go one step further to use their findings in order to classify or
predict different personality traits. There is just one study, conducted by K. Korjus et al. [11], where the
authors tried to detect personality from the spectral content of a large dataset of resting-state EEG
recordings using a combination of classifiers and features, without achieving a significant classification
rate. The authors concluded that the power spectrum of the EEG data could not contribute to the
detection of personality traits.
The spectral analysis of EEG has shed some light on the neurobiological basis of personality,
but the most promising results have been obtained when functional connectivity of resting state EEG
was taken into consideration. Resting-state connectivity EEG studies have been conducted within
the framework of two concepts concerning the dynamic nature of brain networks. The first concept
considers that brain networks are static across time [18–22]. As an example, in the study conducted
by Toschi et al. [18], the authors reported that conscientiousness (C) was linked to graph theoretical
nodal properties of the regions included in the fronto-parietal and the default mode networks. In that
study, however, the authors did not find any relation between the functional connectivity and the other
four personality traits. The second concept, which is an improvement of the first one, considers that
brain networks are dynamic, and time-evolving [23,24]. In the study conducted by Kabbara et al. [23],
for example, the authors used a sliding window approach for every subject to analyze the EEG bands
in association with personality traits. They found that agreeableness (A) was positively related with
the overall centrality variation in the alpha band of the posterior cingulate cortex, while neuroticism
(N) was negatively associated with the theta band and with the dynamic variability of temporal lobe
regions (left middle temporal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, and transverse temporal region).
Finally, there was a negative correlation between C and changes in the alpha band.
The primary purpose of personality neuroscience goes beyond the understanding of the
neurobiological systems of traits and focuses on the parameters derived from proximal and distal
sources that differentiate one person from another towards constructing personality trait models [25].
Proximal sources refer to neural systems related to the emotional states revealing specific traits,
while distal sources describe genetic and environmental factors. Because proximal sources refer to neural
systems that are strongly related to emotional states, our main motivation is driven by the assumption
that the EEG response elicited during emotional processing may provide features able to predict
personality more accurately, reflecting the connection between personality and emotional processing.
Several studies have appeared in this direction recently. For example, J. Wache et al. [26] conducted
an experiment based on physiological responses to automatically detect personality using the Big-Five
model. Emotional clips were presented to participants who rated them in terms of valence and arousal.
The results supported that baseline accuracy for C and openness (O) was 53%, while for the rest of the
traits, it dropped to 50%. The highest recognition accuracy was achieved for O, which varied from
63% up 91%, according to the affective content of the stimuli. In addition, A seems to be a strong

Brain Sci. 2020, 10, 278

predictor for the high valence-high arousal (HVHA) group, scoring 84%. Low recognition performance
was observed in C and N with overall accuracy of 31% and 63%, respectively. One limitation of
this study, resulting in low accuracy levels, is the use of only one EEG electrode. In another study
conducted by Zhao et al. [27], the authors analyzed EEG brain waves with the aim to recognize
individual’s personality traits in a sample of 37 participants while they were watching emotional
materials. They extracted features from EEG signals and from subjective ratings, which were fed to
a support vector machine classifier (SVM) in order to predict the five personality traits’ dimensions.
Their model achieved 66.4% accuracy in the classification of extraversion (E), 73.5% in the classification
of A, 74.2% for C, 70.4% in the classification for N, and 68% in the classification of O, while the
introduction of features from subjective ratings increased the classification accuracy of the model.
The basis of our study builds on (i) our main assumption that personality can be automatically
predicted by EEG signals derived during emotional processing, (ii) the study by Zhao et al. [27],
and (iii) the fact that functional connectivity studies in resting-state EEG are more promising compared
with spectral analysis. Following this motivation, our main goal is to assess if brain networks can be
used to automatically predict personality more accurately. For this purpose, the AMIGOS dataset [28]
was used herein. Features derived by functional connectivity networks were adopted for classification
purposes, because (i) our prior studies [29–35] suggest that there is an alternation in functional
connectivity networks during affective processing, while (ii) to the best of our knowledge, there is no
other study that has assessed the value of functional connectivity features in the automatic recognition
of personality. ReliefF [36] methodology was adopted in order to rank the produced features, while the
first ten common features with the highest ranking were fed to an SVM classifier in order to predict
each trait separately. The results herein reinforce our motivation, exhibiting pretty high detection
accuracy for all basic five traits (E: 83.8%, A: 86.5%, C: 83.8%, N: 83.8%, and O: 73%). The dataset
used in our study, as well as the feature extraction and classification models used, are presented in
Section 2. The analytic results are illustrated in Section 3. Critical discussion and conclusions are given
in Section 4.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. AMIGOS Dataset
The AMIGOS dataset attempts to approach personality and emotions with a very broad
range of features, as it contains information coming from multichannel EEG, electrocardiogram
(ECG), and galvanic skin response (GSR) during various affective states, personality questionnaires,
self-assessment of mood, and so on [28]. The AMIGOS dataset will be briefly described, as the readers
are advised to refer to [28] for more details, while a brief overview of our methodology is presented in
Figure 1.
AMIGOS includes two experiments. In the short videos experiment used in the current study,
40 (37 used in the current study owing to missing data) participants watched 16 short videos
(duration < 250 s) with emotional content extracted from movies so that specific affective states
were elicited. The participants had to self-assess their emotional reaction evoked by a certain video
by selecting among the six basic emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger, and neutral),
as well as to rate each video by means of valence and arousal. Valence measures positive or negative
affectivity, while arousal describes how calm or excited someone is after being exposed to specific
stimuli [37]. Considering the two poles of valence and arousal, we formed four categories (high valence
high arousal—HVHA, high valence low arousal—HVLA, low valence high arousal—LVHA, and low
valence low arousal—LVLA). In our study, we used eight trials of HVHA and LVHA (four trials each).
Apart from the experimental process mentioned above, participants’ personality profiles were modeled
through the Big-Five inventory [38,39], provided in the form of a self-report online questionnaire with
50 items in a seven-point Likert scale. These 50 questions were divided into five sets, and each set was
used to describe one of the five dimensions of personality: N, E, O, A, and C.

for each brainwave plus one for the full spectrum (4–45 Hz).
The result of iCOH was a weighted and directed to a network of size 14 × 14. Because the
interpretation of directionality in particular frequencies is difficult [46], we transformed the directed
networks to a directed one by taking the absolute values of the iCOH matrix. As our new matrix was

As cross-spectrum is a complex number, coherence is also a complex number. We chose to take
only the imaginary part of coherence (iCOH), because Nolte et al. [46] have shown that the imaginary
part of coherence is not vulnerable to volume conduction distortions. For the computation of iCOH,
we used the FCLAB [47]. As iCOH is computed for every frequency, we averaged the frequencies
belonging to a certain brain rhythm (theta: 4–7 Hz, alpha1: 8–9 Hz, alpha2: 10–11 Hz, SMR: 12–14 Hz,
beta: 15–29 Hz, and gamma: 30–45 Hz). Thus, for every subject, we computed seven networks—one
for each brainwave plus one for the full spectrum (4–45 Hz).
The result of iCOH was a weighted and directed to a network of size 14 × 14. Because the
interpretation of directionality in particular frequencies is difficult [46], we transformed the directed
networks to a directed one by taking the absolute values of the iCOH matrix. As our new matrix was
symmetric, the upper and lower triangular matrices were the same. Thus, we used only the upper
triangular matrix, which counts (14 × 14 − 14)/2 = 91 elements that represent the weights of the edges
of the network. These 91 elements served as separate features for personality recognition.
From a mathematical perspective, a weighted graph is a mathematical representation of a set of
elements (vertices) that may be linked through connections of variable weights (edges). The graph
theoretical parameters are quantitative properties of the network that can differentiate one network
from another. In addition to the aforementioned 91 features, we added the most prominent graph
theoretical parameters, as they can reveal information that is not detectable by single edge weights.
A total of 29,540 graph theoretical features were computed using the brain connectivity toolbox [48].
Features are either univariate features indicating the local or global properties of the graph, or bivariate
connection features exploring the strength of nodes’ associations. Nevertheless, after the feature
selection procedure (see Section 2.4), only the edges’ weights and betweenness centrality (BC) proved
to be enough to describe properly the five dimensions of personality. For this reason, we only describe
herein the BC and its importance to networks’ efficiency.
BC is the fraction of all the shortest paths in the network that contain a specific node. This parameter
is based on the concept that central nodes appear in many short paths and “control” the information
flow [49]. The undirected variant of BC of node i is calculated as
bi =

X
1
(n − 1)(n − 2)

ρhj (i)
h, j ∈ N
h , j, h , i, i , j

ρhj

,

where ρhj is the number of shortest paths between h and j and ρhj (i) is the number of shortest paths
between h and j that include node i [49]. The weighted variant of BC requires the calculation of
weighted path lengths.
All the aforementioned features were computed for each one of the eight trials mentioned in 2.1
and then averaged by group (HVHA, LVHA).
2.4. Feature Selection
In order to reduce the number of the features, ReliefF algorithm [36] was used. ReliefF was chosen
because it is an efficient algorithm that is not restricted by the different characteristics of the dataset,
while it can work with both discrete and continuous features. Initially, all features’ weights were set
to 0 and a sample xr from the training set was randomly selected. Then, ReliefF finds the k nearest

In the current study, the dominant classifier was the SVM, which forms a principled approach
to machine learning problems and is considered suitable for binary classification [50], as in our case,
where we divided the personality traits to high/low cases.
The mathematical model of linear SVM is defined as follows [51]. We are given a training set

all samples 𝑥⃗ into groups correctly, the aim is to find the maximum distance between the
hyperplane and the nearest point 𝑥⃗ from either group. The optimal hyperplane is then defined by
the following classification decision function:

samples x i into groups correctly, the aim is to find the maximum distance between the hyperplane

where ai ≥ 0 are the Lagrangian multipliers of samples x i . Cases with ai = 0 are not part of the solution.
When non-linearity is essential to the problem formulation, the only difference compared with
the linear model is that we first need to perform data mapping to another high-dimensional space H,
using a non-linear mapping called Φ. After that, the linear model is used again to perform classification
in the new space H. The kernel function k that is introduced through such a mapping procedure is
a symmetric, semi-positive definite function satisfying the Mercer theorem, and converts the previous
classification decision function as follows:

analysis is described as follows:




k x , x i = exp −γ x − x i 2 , where γ > 0
→

→

It can be observed that the Gaussian kernel depends on the Euclidean distance between x and x i and
is based on the assumption that similar points are found close to each other in the feature space [52].
Moreover, two commonly used kernel functions that we also test in our project is the quadratic
kernel [52] and the cubic kernel, namely a second and a third degree polynomial kernel function,
respectively, are described as follows:
→ →  → →
2
→ →  → →
3
k x , x i = x · x i + 1 and k x , x i = x · x i + 1
The quadratic kernel not only determines the similarity of input samples, but also examines
combination of features up to the order of the polynomial.
Therefore, taking into consideration the benefits of the Gaussian kernel, we chose to apply specific
variants of Gaussian SVMs, namely coarse Gaussian SVM, medium Gaussian SVM, quadratic SVM,
and cubic
√ SVM. In particular, medium Gaussian SVM performs medium distinctions with kernel scale
set to P and provides medium model flexibility, similarly to quadratic SVM,
while coarse Gaussian
√
SVM makes coarse distinctions between classes, with kernel scale set to 4 P and provides low model
flexibility. In both cases, P was set to 10, reflecting the number of most significant features.
For validation purposes of the models, fivefold cross validation was used. According to fivefold
cross validation, the dataset was randomly partitioned in five equal non-overlapping subsets, where four
of them were used for training and one for testing purposes. The cross-validation process was then

Brain Sci. 2020, 10, 278

repeated five times (the folds), with each of the five subsamples used exactly once as the validation
data. The five results from the folds were then averaged to produce a single estimation of accuracy.
In addition to accuracy, the prediction of each personality dimension was binarized to low and
high. In this form, we considered the successful prediction of a low and high trait as true positive
(TP) and true negative (TN), respectively. If the classification failed in the low trait, we considered the
sample as a false negative (FN) and, in case of high trait failure, we considered the sample as a false
positive (FP). Therefore, accuracy is defined as
acc =

while sensitivity is the TP rate given by TPTP
+FN and specificity is the TN rate, TN+FP . The area
under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) metric denotes the prediction potential
of a classification algorithm for varying classification threshold values and is important in cases of
non-homogeneous classes.

3. Results
Taking into consideration the suitability and the performance capabilities, this section presents
the results mainly derived from SVMs. The assessment of results was based on four main parameters,
namely the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC that were described above. Tables 2–4 present the
results regarding the three scenarios, where scenario no. 1 concerns the HVHA block of clips, scenario
no. 2 concerns the LVHA block of clips, and scenario no. 3 describes their fusion. The dominant
classifier was the medium Gaussian SVM, although in some cases, other classifiers provided slightly
higher accuracy.

Table 2 presents the results derived from the features selected by the HVHA block of clips. As can
be observed, high valence is a definer of E factor, which scores high prediction accuracy (83.8%).

O and C score lower in accuracy, with O also being described by zero sensitivity, which makes
it the weakest predictor for this scenario. In particular, the sensitivity is extremely low for O and C,
reflecting the inability of the test to truly detect these conditions. Instead, specificity is low for N and
A, indicating low power of the test in ruling out these personality variables.
The LVHA scenario (Table 3) could be described as the weakest test, as it results in the lowest
accuracy outcomes for all of the Big-Five dimensions. This was expected, as we are aware that low
valence may be more complex for the human brain to perceive and induces the collaboration of multiple
brain regions, increasing the process complexity [30]. In this scenario, extroversion also appears with
low sensitivity and specificity values.
As we expected, the fusion scheme clearly improves the results regarding all of the examined
parameters. Table 4 confirms that the fusion scenario reaches the highest accuracy rates for all of the
Big-Five dimensions of personality. The lowest sensitivity parameter concerns again the O trait, though
this was expected, as O appears to be the most controversial trait, characterized by high abstractness,
unconventionality, thin mental boundaries, and intuition [53].
4. Discussion
This study presents innovative research on the detection of personality traits during affective
processing by means of neurophysiological signals. The participants’ personality profiles were modeled
through the EEG signals obtained by the AMIGOS database. The administration of the Big-Five
personality inventory was performed by a self-assessment online questionnaire. The participants
were also asked to rate each video according its emotional content in regard to valence and arousal.
The most crucial part of the AMIGOS dataset is the use of EEG signals, which are recorded through
an easily accessible, wireless, and wearable EEG system (EPOC). With these attributes, this dataset and
our proposed analysis framework provide insights into an interdisciplinary aspect by cross-referencing
the internal, and hence personal impression of self, with the external neurologically evidenced data
derived from emotional reactivity.
From Figure 3, it can be observed that the most important features are the edges in the network
except for the O trait, where the nodal BC is dominant. It can also be observed that each personality
trait is strongly associated with a characteristic brain region. Starting with A, we observe that it is
related with brain activity in the frontal and the occipital lobes with a dominant theta frequency band.
As for N, it is mostly detected in the parieto-temporal lobe, probably owing to the hippocampus
involvement, with a left-side dominance while increased theta activity is also detected.
Furthermore, as mentioned before, the O trait is strongly associated with BC. More specifically,
increased BC implies an enhanced coordination of brain networks because it plays a significant role in
information transition and controls the information flow. C covariates with the communication in the
lateral prefrontal cortex and both parietal lobes, while E is associated with increased connectivity in
the frontal and left temporal lobes mainly detected in alpha and theta frequency bands.
As we have already mentioned in the introduction, Zhao and colleagues [27] have recently
attempted to predict personality from EEG signals during emotional processing. Our main differences
from their work can be seen in the fact that our study uses a low-cost EEG device while Zhao et al. [27]
have used professional equipment, which cannot be applied in real world applications aimed at to
the average end-user. On the other hand, considering the complex nature of emotions and emotional
processing, we used features derived from multivariate modelling, like brain networks. Our assumption,
that the brain networks may serve as a better feature-set for the automatic recognition of personality,
is actually supported by our classification results, which, in comparison with Zhao et al. [27], are a bit
higher in terms of accuracy (E: 83.8% (Zhao: 66.4%), A: 86.5% (73.5%), C: 83.8% (74.2%), N: 83.8%
(70.4%), O: 73% (68%)). We should emphasize here that the obtained results based on brain networks
perform better than the spectral features reported in Zhao et al. [27], even though the underlying data
suffer in quality as they are obtained from low-cost equipment. This performance further highlights
the potential of second-order correlation features in the analysis of EEG signals.

Brain Sci. 2020, 10, 278

Taking into consideration that N is intertwined with the expression of negative emotions such as
feeling worried and anxious, while extroversion is associated with positive emotions as optimism and
pleasure from social interactions, our results imply that this susceptibility towards positive or negative
states may come as a consequence of personality traits, and vice versa [54]. From a mathematical
perspective, this means that the observed variance in brain’s emotional reactivity (like event related
potentials (ERPs) [55], event related oscillations (EROs) [56,57], functional connectivity [34], and so
on) may be explained by the variance observed in personality traits, and vice versa. For this reason,
we may assume that human personality can be more clearly predicted from the EEG response during
elicitation of high arousing emotional stimuli, as low arousing stimuli result in small (or insignificant)
inter-individual variability [55]. This is the main reason that low arousal categories were excluded for
the current work. Furthermore, the relationship between valence and arousal is more complicated
than one could expect. For example, anger and joy are similar regarding their emotional arousal,
but completely opposite in terms of valence. Besides that, co-variation of arousal with valence is
particularly strong in the case of negative images, which tend to be rated as more arousing than
positive images [58]. Despite these considerations, dimensional and discrete perspectives differ in how
emotional states are conceptualized and described (see [59]). Hence, the inclusion of arousal as an
independent variable is expected to create more problems than opportunities in the classification of the
five traits of personality.
The personality–affect relationship has generated great attention since it was proposed in Eysenck’s
personality model [60]. Eysenck claimed that E, the personality dimension that describes a person as
either communicative or uncommunicative, is related to low cortical arousal—that is, extraverts require
more external stimulations than introverts [61]. His model also proposed that neurotics were more
sensitive to external stimulation and become easily nervous in the presence of minor life stressors.
Many affective studies have attempted to validate and extend Eysenk’s findings [62]. Nevertheless,
few works have investigated affective correlates of traits other than E and N owing to the complexity
of the personality construct, as many factors should be taken into consideration in order to properly
classify an individual according to the initial model described in [60]. This situation complicates the
use of affective recognition models in classifying personality traits.
In our work, we address the hypothesis that EEG features during emotional processing can
provide strong associations to effectively predict the five personality traits. For this purpose, we used
a dataset that involves affect and personality traits [28]. The main findings revealed high detection
accuracy for all of the Big-Five personality traits (N: 83.8%, E: 83.8%, O: 73%, A: 86.5%, and C: 83.8%),
thus confirming the initial hypothesis that personality features can be automatically predicted by
EEG during emotional stimulation. These findings appear to be consistent with the findings of prior
studies of brain activation patterns in relation to emotional states that presented a specific display of
physiological responses as indicative of equivalent personality features [22]. N is typically assessed with
items emphasizing affective content; E, A, and C emphasize behavioral content; and O is represented
primarily by cognitive content [63,64]. This could explain our results related to specificity in classifying
every dimension/trait, which were lower for O and higher for N, A, E, and C.
Increased attention should be paid in O, when someone comes to interpret our results, as O has
very low (0–0.1) sensitivity. This happened because the classification algorithm failed to detect the low
case and assigned all samples to the high class. In order to further investigate if this problem is data- or
algorithm-specific, we tested several other classification algorithms with very similar results. However,
considering the O values (Figure 2), it can be noticed that their distribution is normal (not right skewed
as the rest) and shifted to the right end with only small variation. Indeed, all of the subjects used in the
current study have high values of O (4.8541 ± 0.6644), although some of them were assigned to a low
class because the k-means algorithm forced to separate them into two classes.
In light of these results, it is important to mention certain limitations reflected in the interpretation
of our findings in order to gain a holistic understanding of the algorithmic potential. The first issue is
that personality is concerned with affect, behavior, cognition, and desire [65]. Further studies focused on

Brain Sci. 2020, 10, 278

12 of 15

the recognition of personality profiles should take into consideration not only the affective, but also the
behavioral and cognitive features to improve the performance of classification algorithms. The second
one is that affect is described as a higher-order functionality, subsuming valence conditions such as
moods, emotion, feeling states, and preferences [64,66]. Further studies with larger sample populations
should take into consideration not only the factors mentioned, but also the ability to differentiate emotion
from mood in order to improve the classification performance. Moreover, personality is evidenced in
terms of thinking, feeling, and behaving, thus self-reflection and introspection are considered to be
of paramount importance in self-assessment and self-evaluation. Taking into consideration that the
AMIGOS participants coincide with the individuals that complete the self-assessment questionnaire,
the results may have been inevitably subjectivity-biased as well as susceptible to self-preservation
cognitive attributions.
It has to be mentioned here that the self-assessment questionnaires are generally perceived as
weak predictors of traits owing to the biased perception of self, while the answers may be intentionally
misleading for various reasons, feeding the HCI system with wrong information about personality.
In this manner, EEG is considered as an unbiased and more accurate method of personality recognition,
whose operation is difficult to be intentionally altered.
The present findings reflect an added value to the relevant previous studies that examined
personality traits through only self-assessment questionnaires. This paper introduces a neuroscientificaly
established evaluation of the personality features, which can significantly contribute to the further study
of traits and developmental characteristics. This can particularly advance the theories of personality,
with a specific focus on (i) how adverse or powerful negative experiences affect our personality
development and (ii) more comprehensive understanding of how one’s current disposition may affect
the coping strategies with reference to emotion regulation.
Our results open new paths in dealing with emotional states and their association to (or aspects of)
personality. Besides the study of issues affecting personality and its consequences on the effectiveness
of HCI systems, our proposed methodology may find applications in psychology studies towards best
practices for improving life standards depending on an individual’s personality. In general, we may
argue that the classification of personality traits should be a priority when applying early cognitive,
emotional, and behavioral techniques to improve the attitude and overall quality of life of people who
experience problems originating from personality, either related to clinical factors (affective and/or
personality disorders) or of a non-clinical nature [67].
