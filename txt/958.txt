Abstract
Despite the attention garnered by the home (or Bdo-it-yourself^) use of tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation), little is known
about the population of actual users. The present study aimed to provide a comprehensive examination of those who purchase tDCS
devices: who they are, how they learn about tDCS, and why and how they stimulate. A link to an online survey was sent to those
who had purchased a tDCS device from seven different companies selling tDCS devices to the public as of June 2016; data was
analyzed from 339 participants, the majority of whom reported residing in North America. The typical respondent was a wealthy,
highly educated, liberal, fortysomething male living in the USA who reported being an early adopter of technology. Nearly three
quarters of respondents reported using tDCS for cognitive enhancement, one-quarter for restoration, and approximately 40% for
treatment; many participants selected a combination of usage indications. Notably, approximately one third of participants utilize
tDCS to self-treat depression. Most who use tDCS for treatment find the technology to be effective, whereas most who use it for
non-treatment purposes (i.e., only enhancement and/or restoration) find it to be ineffective. Approximately 40% of those who
purchase tDCS devices either quit using the device (mostly due to lack of efficacy) or have never used the device (mostly due to lack
of guidance). Participants depart from established scientific protocol particularly with regard to frequency of stimulation, with 8.4%
reporting self-administering 100+ sessions of tDCS. With regard to side effects, a small subset of users (n = 10) reported serious
skin burns. This study provides an empirical foundation on which to base policy recommendations and offers a fact-based
perspective on a bioethical debate that has too-often been one step removed from reality.

Introduction
In the last two decades, there has been a vigorous debate about
the ethical, legal, and social implications of human enhancement
technologies (Farah et al. 2004; Lucke et al. 2011; Parens 2014;
Farah 2015; Brenninkmeijer and Zwart 2016). One particular
area of discussion has centered on the home (or Bdo-it-yourself^;
DIY) use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS;

et al. 2014; Fitz and Reiner 2015; Wexler 2017), a technique that
provides low levels of electrical stimulation to the brain.
Scientists, clinicians, and ethicists have warned about the potential dangers and unintended consequences associated with the
home use of tDCS (Cabrera et al. 2013; Iuculano and Cohen
Kadosh 2013; Sarkar et al. 2014; Brem et al. 2014; Steenbergen
et al. 2016), which is an experimental research technique (e.g., it
does not have FDA approval or clearance in the USA; Fregni
et al. 2015; Wexler 2016a). In 2015, the International Federation
of Clinical Neurophysiology published a position paper cautioning against the DIY use of tDCS (IFCN 2015); the following
year, an open letter to the DIY tDCS community—outlining the
risks of brain stimulation—was published in Annals of
Neurology and signed by 39 researchers (Wurzman et al. 2016).
Despite the attention garnered by the home use of tDCS,
little is known about the population of actual users. To date,
only two studies on home tDCS users exist: Jwa (2015) conducted a content analyses of postings to the online tDCS

J Cogn Enhanc (2018) 2:114–134

subreddit forum (www.reddit.com/r/tdcs), a survey, and indepth interviews; Wexler (2016b) presented a preliminary
sketch of the practices of home users, based on interviews
and reviews of the tDCS-related forums, websites, and blogs.
However, these studies had a number of limitations. First, because they relied on Internet sources, the sampled population
may have skewed both towards active users of tDCS (who may
be more likely to visit the tDCS subreddit and related websites)
and towards younger, technology-savvy users of tDCS. Thus,
findings may not have been representative of the broader user
population. Second, both studies were conducted in late 2013
and early 2014, soon after the first direct-to-consumer wearable
tDCS devices were marketed to the general public. The population of users, as well as the devices they utilize, may have
shifted significantly in recent years, due to both extensive media coverage of DIY tDCS in 2014 and 2015 (Batuman 2015;
Miller 2014; Radiolab 2014) as well as the increase in companies selling tDCS devices directly to consumers—in some
cases for cheaper than it costs to build one from scratch.
The present study aimed to provide an updated, comprehensive examination of those who purchase consumer tDCS
devices: who they are, how and why they use brain stimulation at home, and what they believe about safety, regulation,
and brain optimization. Rather than recruiting via online avenues, the present study involved partnering with seven of the
ten companies actively selling direct-to-consumer tDCS devices to the public as of June 2016. The resulting sample was
comprised of individuals who had actually purchased such
devices—not just those who had visited online forums. The
study consisted of a survey that included both open-ended and
forced-choice responses, allowing for the capture of quantitative data for some questions and qualitative data for others.
This study addressed a number of specific questions. First,
while previous studies have shown that home users utilize
tDCS both for cognitive enhancement and treatment (Jwa
2015; Wexler 2016b), it is unclear which characteristics, if
any, differentiate these two groups. Thus, this study aimed to
understand if Benhancers^ and Btreaters^ differ from each other in meaningful ways (e.g., on demographics, attitudes, usage
practices, and other measures). Second, this study aimed to
better understand those who quit using tDCS, a population
that has not yet been examined. Third, this study sought to
determine if there was a significant population of users who
are not actively engaged with the tDCS subreddit, and if so,
what characteristics might differentiate them from visitors to
the subreddit. Fourth, this study sought to understand how
home users of tDCS differed from the general population by
comparing participant data (e.g., on sociodemographics and
attitudes) to data from the US population, where possible.
Fifth, this study aimed to provide the first descriptive account
of those who utilize tDCS primarily on others.
This study adds to the existing literature on cognitive enhancement in a number of ways. Although previous studies

115

have examined the demographics, motivations, and attitudes
of those who utilize cognitive enhancement drugs (e.g.,
Eickenhorst et al. 2012; Ragan et al. 2013; Forlini et al.
2014; Ott and Biller-Andorno 2014; Vargo and Petróczi
2016; Riddell et al. 2017), there is little data to-date on similar
measures for those who utilize brain stimulation devices
marketed for cognitive enhancement. In addition, while many
studies on the use of cognitive enhancement drugs have focused on local populations, often comprised of university students, the methodology employed here allowed for the examination of a unique sample that cut across a wide array of ages
and geographical locations. As users of pharmacological cognitive enhancement often source their drugs informally or illicitly (Ott and Biller-Andorno 2014; Vargo and Petróczi
2016), a similar methodology would not likely be feasible in
that context. Furthermore, this study is one of the few to compare sociodemographics and attitudes of users of cognitive
enhancement products—particularly with regard to education,
income, political views, and views on religion and science—
to existing population data.

Methods
Recruitment
Of the ten companies selling tDCS devices directly to consumers as of June 2016, seven agreed to participate in the study
on the condition of anonymity. Five of these companies were
based in the USA, though all shipped devices internationally. In
June 2016, an email was sent to companies’ customer lists with
a unique link to the online survey (five companies emailed their
customers directly; customers of two companies were emailed
directly by the author via Qualtrics online survey software). A
follow-up reminder email was sent to the email lists of five of
the seven companies after approximately 3 weeks (two companies did not comply with requests to send out a reminder
email). The text of both the initial email and the reminder email
were kept consistent across companies. The survey remained
open for each unique link for approximately 30 days.
Following completion of the survey, all participant data was
anonymized and divided into subsets based on the unique links
assigned to each company. Anonymized data from each unique
link was shared only with that specific company; in other
words, each company saw anonymized data only from respondents who clicked through their unique link.

Survey Instrument
The survey instrument (Appendix 1) was designed based on
previous work studying home users of brain stimulation.
Comments on the initial draft of the survey were solicited
from members of the DIY brain stimulation community,

116

consumer tDCS manufacturers, sociologists, ethicists, and
neuroscientists. The survey instrument underwent pilot testing
prior to launch to ensure that all questions were clear and that
navigation through the survey functioned as expected. The
survey contained questions about participants’ tDCS device(s), usage practices, beliefs, attitudes, and
sociodemographics; the number of questions displayed for
any one respondent was contingent upon participants’ particular involvement with tDCS. For example, participants who
reported using tDCS both on themselves and others saw the
greatest number of questions (80), whereas participants who
reported purchasing a device for use on oneself, but never
using it, saw the fewest number of questions (40). The survey
contained a mix of closed and open-ended responses for conventional content analysis.

Analysis
Closed-ended questions were analyzed using SPSS v24
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Descriptive statistics were used
to characterize the composition and properties of the sample, and simple inferential statistics (Pearson chi-square)
and effect sizes (Cramer’s V), as well as independent
sample t tests, were used to explore significant differences
between subgroups. For each open-ended question, two
individuals (the author and another coder) began by separately analyzing a subset of responses (generally ~ 100),
developing categorical themes or codes iteratively (Chi
1997; Braun and Clarke 2006). Next, following discussion of the central concepts and research questions, both
coders agreed upon a final set of thematic categories with
sets of indicator codes. With final coding themes in place,
each coder proceeded to code the entire data set separately. Each theme was treated as a binary variable, and each
open-ended response received a B1^ if the theme was
present or B0^ if it was absent. Once all comments were
coded, the frequency with which any theme emerged in
the comments was compared across contrastive conditions. Initial inter-coder reliability (Lombard et al. 2002)
was calculated across the ten open-ended questions coded
(Cohen’s Kappa was 0.97); after review, agreement was
100%.

Results
Response Rate and Exclusion Criteria
Response Rate
The recruitment email message (Appendix A) was sent to
a total of 10,393 email addresses across seven companies;
as 232 emails bounced, the message was successfully

J Cogn Enhanc (2018) 2:114–134

delivered to 10,161 email addresses. This number does
not necessarily reflect the number of unique individuals
who received the recruitment email; it is possible that (a)
participants purchased devices from two companies in the
survey and therefore received an email from each company and/or (b) a single participant used multiple email addresses to purchase a device within the same company.
Although companies were instructed to send emails only
to those who had purchased a tDCS device, one
company’s mailing list did not differentiate between those
who purchased accessories versus devices, and another
company sent emails to everyone who had opted in to
its mailing list. Together, these two companies’ email lists
made up approximately 7% of all email addresses.
To ensure as well-controlled a sample as possible, no recruitment links were posted to social media, the tDCS
subreddit or other tDCS-related websites. During the month
that the survey was open, the tDCS subreddit, Twitter, and
tDCS-related blogs and websites were closely monitored for
mentions of the survey. Aside from a home user who posted a
survey link to Twitter, the survey appears to have remained
limited to the seven companies’ customer lists.
In total, 349 respondents completed the survey in its entirety, for an aggregate response rate of 3.9%. Response rates for
individual companies ranged from 1.1 to 5.7%, with a median
of 5%.

Exclusion Criteria
Eight participants were excluded because they did not report
owning a consumer tDCS device. Another two participants
were excluded because they had typed random letters for all
the open-ended responses. Thus, in total, data from 339 participants was analyzed.
As an additional check on the data, all responses were
reviewed to ensure that those coming from each company’s
unique link reported purchasing a device from that specific
company. In total, 96.5% (n = 327) of respondents
Bmatched^ in terms of unique company link and reported
device, while 3.5% (n = 12) were Bmismatches.^ The
Bmismatches^ may have occurred for a number of reasons:
(a) participants who purchased devices and accessories
from more than one company may have received multiple
survey links, and may have clicked through the link from
the company from which they purchased an accessory, not
a device; (b) participants may have clicked on the survey
link through the Twitter posting mentioned above, or were
forwarded the survey link by another individual; and (c)
participants may have erred in reporting on their purchased
device. However, after ensuring that each of the 12
Bmismatches^ owned at least one consumer tDCS device,
these participants were included in the analyses.

As US residents comprised more than two-thirds of the sample, population data from the USA was selected for comparative purposes. Similar results were obtained when comparing
data from the general US population to either all participant
data (N = 339) or to the subset of US residents only (n = 233);
comparisons using data from all participants are reported here
and statistics for both are reported in Table 2.
Compared to the US population, participants’ had a higher
educational attainment: most (77.9%) had a college degree or
higher, compared to 44.5% of the general US population, and
36.3% had a master’s or doctoral-level degree, compared to
just 12.0% percent of the general US population (U.S. Census
Bureau 2016, p. 2, Table 1). Given that educational attainment
has been shown to be positively correlated with income level
(see, e.g., Boshara et al. 2015), it was not surprising that participants reported higher levels of income compared to the US
population. Figure 3 shows the distribution of income among
the subset of US residents as compared to the US general
population (U.S. Census Bureau 2017).
Most participants (70.5%) reported being politically liberal; this proportion is nearly three times that of the general US
population who self-identify as liberal (24%; Saad 2015). In
addition, consumers of tDCS devices are far less engaged with
religion than the US population, as measured by frequency of
attending religious services: the majority of participants
(77.9%) never or rarely attend religious services, compared
to 36% of the US population (Pew Research Center 2015b,
p. 152).

Detailed sociodemographic data is reported in Table 1. The
mean age of participants was 45.3 (SD = 13.9; see also age
histogram in Fig. 1), which was surprising given that previous
studies have portrayed typical home users of tDCS as being in
their 20s or 30s (Jwa 2015; Wexler 2016b). Respondents were
split relatively evenly across generations, with approximately
one-third each being Millenials, Gen Xers, and Baby
Boomers. Although the majority of participants were male
(83.5%), there was a much higher proportion of females
(15.3%) than the 4% previously reported by Jwa (2015).
Most participants (73.5%) reported residing in North
America (Fig. 2). Across the 32 countries represented in the
sample, the three most-common were the USA (68.7%),
Australia (5.3%), and Canada (4.7%). Roughly a quarter of
all US-based respondents reside in California, with the next
most-represented states being Massachusetts, New York, and
Texas.

Compared to the US population, consumers of tDCS devices
are earlier adopters of technology: most participants (63.7%)
report being Bthe first^ or Bamong the first^ to try a new
technology product relative to their peers (Table 2), while a
recent study found that just 15% of Americans report trying a
new technology before others (Pew Research Center 2016a, p.
2). Consumers of tDCS devices are also far more interested in
science than the US population: most (82.3%) report reading
articles about science frequently or very frequently (Table 2),
while a recent survey found that just 37% of Americans enjoy
keeping up with science news Ba lot^ (Pew Research Center
2015a, p. 82 Q3).

supplements or non-prescription drugs to improve cognition;
and more than a third each reported using (a) brain-training
games, (b) binaural beats, or (c) self-tracking tools to optimize
productivity (Table 3a). Just 7.7% of participants have used
direct-to-consumer electroencephalography (EEG) devices,
which purportedly measure and display a user’s electrical
brainwave activity and are generally marketed for Bwellness^
purposes (see, e.g., Emotiv Insight, https://www.emotiv.com/
insight/ and Muse, http://www.choosemuse.com/). Thus,
although EEG- and tDCS-based devices represent the major
direct-to-consumer, wearable neurotechnology products
marketed for self-improvement, there may be little overlap
among their users.

Learning About tDCS
Participants were asked to describe, in their own words,
how they first heard about tDCS. Very few participants
(7.1%) learned about tDCS from within their own social
networks (i.e., from another person); most heard about it
from the Internet (43.1%), podcast/radio (33.0%), or
news/magazine outlets (13%); some first heard about
tDCS from a television show or documentary (5.3%),
or a scientific journal (5.0%). Notably, approximately
1 in 8 participants (13.3%) came to tDCS after hearing
about it from a single Radiolab podcast episode
(Radiolab 2014).

Most participants learned about which stimulation parameters to utilize (i.e., how to apply stimulation) from the
Internet (52.9%). Others learned from the device manufacturer
(20.8%), as some companies provide information on their
websites (or include instructions with the device) regarding
usage. The remainder learned about stimulation parameters
from trial and error (14.6%), scientific journals (14.6%), or
tDCS placement websites (e.g., http://tdcsplacements.com/;
8.1%). A small percentage (9.1%) mentioned that their
device had a pre-set placement configuration and they did
not need to learn about stimulation parameters.

tDCS Device(s)
On average, participants paid $177 for their tDCS device, with
a median of $139. Though prices paid ranged from $0 (presumably for a home-built or gifted device) to $6000 (for the
highest-end device), the middle 90% of participants (i.e., excluding the top and bottom 5%) paid between $25 and $325
for their device. Most participants (79.9%) reported owning
only one device and purchasing it directly from the manufacturer (90.7%; Table 4). At the time of the survey, participants
reported owning a tDCS device for a mean length of

16.9 months (Table 4). Participants reported owning a total of
421 neurostimulation devices from 18 different companies.
This figure includes manufacturers selling devices that are
not expressly marketed for tDCS (e.g., iontophoresis devices,
research-grade devices, and Thync edition one), as well as
several companies no longer actively selling tDCS devices
as of spring 2016. Notably, 66.0% of all reported devices
came from a single manufacturer (Table 4).

Primary Intended Use: Self vs. Other
Primary Intended Use: Self vs. Others
The vast majority of respondents (96.5%, n = 327) reported
purchasing a device to use primarily on themselves, whereas
3.5% (n = 12) purchased a device with the primary intention
of administering stimulation to others.
Below, results are briefly reported from participants who
purchased tDCS devices primarily for use on others; the
BPurpose of use^ section through the BPerceived effects of
tDCS stimulation^ report results only from those who
intended to use tDCS primarily on themselves.
Participants Who Use tDCS Primarily on Others
Among those who purchased a tDCS device to use primarily
on others (n = 12; 9 males), in all but one case, the intended
subject(s) of stimulation included a family member, most
commonly a child (n = 6) or spouse (n = 4). Most individuals
(n = 11) were using tDCS on others to treat disease or mitigate
disease-related symptoms, such as those related to depression
(n = 4), traumatic brain injury (n = 2), chronic pain (n = 1),
migraine headaches (n = 1), epilepsy (n = 1), incontinence
due to multiple sclerosis (n = 1), and memory loss due to

primary progressive aphasia (n = 1). Five individuals reported
using tDCS to affect cognition—memory, focus, attention—in
some way, although the line between treatment and enhancement was not always clear (e.g., two participants used tDCS in
an attempt to improve a family member’s concentration levels:
one reported that a diagnosis of ADD had been given, whereas
the other only noted that the child had low grades).
Among those who have used tDCS on others, the number
of sessions administered ranged from 5 to 100 with a mean of
28; electrical current levels utilized ranged from .5 to 2
milliamps (mA) with a mean of 1.59 mA; and the typical
length of stimulation session in minutes ranged from 10 to
40 with a mean of 23.64. Most (n = 7) have used tDCS at least
once on themselves, but only some (n = 3) reported still actively self-administering stimulation.
Half of those who have used tDCS on others (n = 6) found
the technique to be successful; some (n = 3) were not sure and
a few (n = 2) felt it was unsuccessful. When asked if tDCS
caused any unwanted effects in those to whom it was administered, most (n = 7) said it did not, though some (n = 3) reported skin sensations (tingling/itching) and one reported a
phosphene (flash of light in the visual field). Six participants
reported that they currently administer tDCS to others once a
month or more, some (n = 2) use it in fits and spurts, and
others (n = 3) no longer use tDCS, mostly (n = 2) due to lack
of efficacy.

Purpose of Use
As noted above, the analyses in this section (as well as the
BFrequency of tDCS use^ section through the BPerceived effects of tDCS stimulation^ section) focus only on those individuals who reported using tDCS primarily on themselves
(n = 327). Among these participants, the reasons for

purchasing consumer tDCS devices were assessed in two
ways: first via an open-ended response and later with forcedresponse questions that were shown to those who reported
using tDCS at least once on themselves (n = 308).
Open-Ended Response
Without any category prompts, participants were asked to report in their own words why they purchased a tDCS device.
Open-ended responses were coded thematically; responses
could be coded for more than one theme. Approximately
two-thirds of participants mentioned cognitive enhancement
reasons and one-third mentioned therapeutic reasons. Notably,
one-quarter mentioned curiosity, novelty, and/or self-experimentation, suggesting that enhancement and treatment are not
the only reasons why individuals purchase consumer tDCS
devices. For clarity, detailed statistics are reported only for
the forced response questions, which queried participants specifically about each usage indication (see below).

restoration), or Bto improve your own cognitive abilities^ (i.e.,
enhancement). As shown in Fig. 4a, approximately threequarters (76.9%) of all those who used tDCS at least once reported using tDCS for enhancement, a little under a half (42.5%)
for treatment, and roughly one-quarter (26.3%) for restoration.
The percentages reported here are slightly higher than those
reported in the previous question for two reasons: first, participants were specifically asked if they had used tDCS for each of
these particular indications, as opposed to a general question
about why they purchased a tDCS device; second, the denominator is smaller, as this question was shown only to those who
had actually used tDCS at least once on themselves (n = 308).
Both across open-ended responses and forced-response questions approximately the same proportion (2:1) was found for
enhancement vs. treatment; this is roughly the same proportion
as reported by Jwa (2015). Similar to Jwa (2015), there was
significant overlap in terms of usage indications; as shown in
Fig. 4b, only 56.8% of participants selected a single indication
(i.e., only treatment, only enhancement, or only restoration).

Restoration, and/or Enhancement

Detailed Usage Indications for Treaters, Enhancers,
and Restorers

abilities (for example, to counteract the effects of aging^ (i.e.,

Among those who have used tDCS for treatment (n = 131),
approximately three quarters (74.0%) reported utilizing tDCS
for depression; anxiety (42.0%) and ADD/ADHD (26.7%) represent the second- and third-most common usage indications
(Table 5). Among both enhancers and restorers, the two most
common indications were improving focus/concentration and

memory (Table 5). Interestingly, the order of these two indications was flipped for each group: memory was the most common target of restorers, whereas focus/concentration was the
most common target of enhancers.
Treaters, enhancers, and restorers differ from each other in
several ways. Those who selected Brestoration^ had a significantly higher mean age (48.6 years; SD = 14.4) than those who
did not [42.5 years; SD = 12.8; t(296) = 0.001, p < =.001], and

those who selected Btreatment^ also had a significantly higher
mean age (46.2 years; SD = 13.5) than those who did not
[42.6 years; SD = 13.3; t(296) = 0.24, p < =.05]. Additionally,
those who selected Benhancement^ had a significantly lower
mean age (43.0 years; SD = 13.2) than those who did not
[47.0 years; SD = 14.0; t(296) = 0.047, p < =.05].
As depicted in Fig. 4b, there was significant overlap among
treaters, enhancers, and restorers, with many participants

selecting more than one usage indication. However, as restorers
were similar to enhancers in that they were aiming to affect a
cognitive function (as opposed to treating a disease), all those
who had selected using tDCS for treatment (Btreaters^; n = 131)
were grouped together and compared to a separate set of individuals who had selected only enhancement, only restoration,
or enhancement and restoration (Bnon-treaters^; n = 167). The
effect of Bpurpose of use^ (i.e., treaters vs. non-treaters) was
then compared across categorical and continuous variables.
Most notably, there was a significant relationship between
gender and usage purpose, with males significantly more likely
to be non-treaters and females more likely to be treaters
(Fig. 5a). Among female treaters (n = 33), most (n = 27) reported using tDCS to self-treat depression. There was also a significant relationship between usage purpose and perceived success of tDCS, with treaters more likely than non-treaters to rate
tDCS as successful, and vice versa Fig. 5b. This effect was
robust and apparent across other indirect measures of success:
non-treaters had a significantly higher mean agreement level
than treaters on a variety of statements, such that they expected
to get more out of tDCS than they actually did, and that tDCS is
merely a novelty item (Table 6b). Furthermore, those who cited
Black of efficacy^ as a reason for quitting tDCS were significantly more likely to be non-treaters than treaters [X2(1, N =
298) = 4.45, p = .035; Cramer’s V = .117]. Not surprisingly,
treaters—who found tDCS to be more successful—were more
likely than non-treaters to be current users of tDCS [X2(1, N =
298) = 4.24, p = .04; Cramer’s V = .122].
Treaters also had a higher mean agreement level (than nontreaters) with the statement that mainstream medicine is out of
touch with the needs of patients (Table 6b). However, there
were no significant differences between treaters and nontreaters when it came to how they value alternative medicine
(Table 6b). Thus, while treaters may be frustrated with modern
medicine, they are not necessarily more likely than enhancers/

b

restorers to turn to alternative medicine; this finding can be
expected given that the present sample is comprised of individuals who have a strong affinity towards science.
Additionally, as shown in Table 6b, non-treaters had a higher
mean agreement level with the statement that the brain can be
Bhacked^ to improve performance. In other words, while
treaters may be turning to tDCS because of a disease or disorder, non-treaters are turning to tDCS to improve their cognition—either for enhancement or restoration—and are therefore more likely to conceptualize the brain as an organ that
can be optimized for performance.

Frequency of tDCS Use
Usage Distribution
The distribution of current users, former users, and those who
never used tDCS is shown in Fig. 6 for participants who purchased tDCS for use on themselves (n = 327). The 59.3% (n =
194) who reported being current users were further subdivided
based on their frequency of use, with the largest group using
tDCS only in Bfits and spurts^ (Fig. 6). Approximately half of all
current users of tDCS (n = 92) report that their frequency of use
has remained constant since they began using tDCS. Those who
reported that their frequency of use has changed were asked to
describe their previous patterns of usage; while responses were
not coded thematically, the overall trend was towards decreasing
usage (e.g., participants reported using tDCS less now than they
did in the past). Thus, even among current users, tDCS is a
technique that participants use less over time, not more.
Those Who Never Used tDCS
Those who purchased a consumer tDCS device but never used
it (5.8%; n = 19) were asked to describe, in their own words,

Participants who answered affirmatively to having used tDCS for either
treatment, enhancement, or restoration were asked to provide follow-up
information, by selecting from a list of diseases/conditions (for treatment)
or elaborating via free-form text (for restoration/enhancement); the latter
responses were coded thematically

why they had not tried stimulation. The most common reasons
provided were concerns regarding the safety of the procedure
and lack of information provided by the manufacturer, particularly with regard to electrode placement. All of these participants reported that they were open to using tDCS, if there was
additional evidence to validate the efficacy and safety of technique, and/or if more information was provided by the manufacturer regarding electrode placement.
Those Who Quit Using tDCS (Former Users)
Approximately one-third of participants (34.9%; n = 114) reported being former users of tDCS; they were asked to describe, in
their words, why they stopped using stimulation. The most

common reason provided was lack of efficacy, although participants also cited side effects, lack of information about stimulation
protocols, and concerns about potential long-term effects, among
other reasons (Table 7). When asked if they would use tDCS
again (and if so, to describe why), 93% reported being open to
using tDCS again, if there was additional evidence regarding
efficacy or additional guidance from the manufacturer (Table 7).
That lack of efficacy is the main reason for quitting tDCS was
supported by further statistical analysis on the differences between current and former users. Current users were much more
likely than former users to rate tDCS as successful (and former
users more likely to rate tDCS as unsuccessful), as shown in
Fig. 7. In addition, current users had a significantly higher mean
disagreement level than former users with related attitudes measures shown in Table 6, such that they expected to get more out
of tDCS then they actually did [mean current users = 2.8 (SD =
1.1), mean former users = 1.8 (SD = 1.0), t(306) = 0.000,
p < =.001], and that tDCS devices are merely novelty items
[mean current users = 3.7 (SD = 1.0), mean former users =
2.9(SD = 1.0), t(306) = 0.000, p < =.001]. Former users hold a
more negative and skeptical view of tDCS, as they had a significantly higher mean agreement level with the statement that
tDCS should not be used without professional guidance [mean
current users = 3.7 (SD = 1.0), mean former users = 3.3 (SD =
1.1), t(306) = 0.001, p < =.001], and a significantly higher mean
disagreement level with the statement that tDCS is a relatively
safe technique [mean current users = 1.8 (SD = .8), mean former
users = 2.4(SD = 1.0), t(198) = 0.000, p < =.001]. As noted earlier in the discussion of treaters vs. non-treaters, current users are
more likely than former users to use tDCS for treatment than
non-treatment (i.e., only enhancement and/or restoration).

Stimulation Parameters and Protocols
Results reported in this section reflect responses from those
who purchased tDCS devices for use primarily on themselves
and reported using tDCS at least once (n = 308). Most participants reported utilizing 2.0 milliamps (mA) of current or less,
similar to the levels of current utilized in scientific studies
(Lefaucheur et al. 2017; Mancuso et al. 2016). Although some
users reported current levels higher than 2.0 mA, all of these
users reported either not understanding the question—it was
an open-ended response—or only owning devices that do not
provide more than 2.0 mA of current. Participants also roughly adhere to the typical length of stimulation sessions used in
scientific studies (~ 15–30 min), with the most common reported length being 20 min (Fig. 8).
Notably, participants departed from established scientific
tDCS protocols when it came to frequency of stimulation (i.e.,
total number of sessions administered). Scientific studies of
tDCS in healthy populations often administer a single session
of stimulation (Horvath et al. 2015); those that examine the effects of tDCS in clinical populations (i.e., to treat depression)

Perceived Effects of tDCS Stimulation

(i.e., a B1^ or B5^ response), a greater number found it totally
unsuccessful than totally successful. Furthermore, among
those who found tDCS to be successful, a far greater number
reported tDCS being Bsomewhat^ successful rather than
Btotally^ successful. Indeed, as shown in Table 6, more than
half of participants (53.7%) agreed that they expected to get
more out of tDCS than they actually did.

Measuring the Effects of Stimulation

Unwanted Side Effects

Participants (n = 308) were asked if they had attempted to measure or quantify the effects that tDCS had on them, and if so, to
describe how they did so. The largest group of participants
(47.7%; n = 147) reported that they did not attempt to measure
the effects the stimulation. Others (19.5%; n = 60) reported
relying on self-observation and self-reflection (i.e., how they
felt). Another group utilized what was coded as Bpersonal
tests^ (12.3%, n = 38), meaning that they created measures of
validity for themselves. Examples of responses coded as personal tests include BI tried memorizing various lists of medical
terms with and without tDCS, and compared my recall with
and without tDCS^ and BI pay attention to if my guitar playing
sounds better and it's like I've made a breakthrough or leap to
another level.^ Other individuals measured the effects of tDCS
with existing cognitive games or tests (11.4%; n = 35) or
tracked their progress in a log or journal (7.5%; n = 23).

Participants were asked if they experienced any unwanted side
effects from tDCS, and if so, to describe them; responses were
coded thematically. The largest group of participants (38.0%)
reported not experiencing unwanted effects from tDCS.
Approximately one-third (35.4%) of all participants reported
experiencing skin irritation (i.e., redness, tingling, itching).
Less common side effects were headaches (10.1%), flashes of
light in the visual field (known as Bphosphenes^; 8.4%) dizziness (1.9%), and a metallic taste (1.5%). Side effects reported by
less than five participants include sleepiness/fatigue (n = 4), difficulty finding words (n = 4), insomnia (n = 3), mania (n = 3),
muscle twitching (n = 3), overstimulation (n = 2), and blurred
vision (n = 3). Reports of mania and overstimulation are especially intriguing, as one recent review article (Matsumoto and
Ugawa 2017) highlighted a number of reports of mania following tDCS stimulation in patients with depression; however, only
two of the five participants who reported either mania or overstimulation in the present study reported using it for treatment
(one for depression only, the other for depression and anxiety).
Notably, 16.9% of participants used the word Bburn^
(e.g., Bskin burn^ or Bburning sensation^) to describe an
unwanted side effect. Mentions of burns were difficult to
interpret, as participants used the term interchangeably to
describe everything from heat sensations to varying degrees
of skin redness. However, a small number of participants

generally administer on the order of 5–15 sessions (Lefaucheur
et al. 2017). Among those who had used tDCS at least once on
themselves, more than 40% of participants had self-administered
over 21 sessions of tDCS, and among them, 8.4% were Bsuperusers^ who had self-administered 100 or more sessions (Fig. 9).

Success of Stimulation
Participants were asked to rate the extent to which they felt
tDCS was successful on a 1 to 5 scale (1 = totally unsuccessful; 5 = totally successful). As shown in Fig. 10, overall, more
individuals found tDCS to be successful (42.5%) than unsuccessful (27.6%), though many participants (29.9%) were not
sure. Among those who felt strongly about the effects of tDCS

(53.7%) agreed that they expected to get more out of
tDCS than they actually did; only 16.2% disagreed with
this statement, though disagreement could mean that (a)
their expectations of tDCS were met; or (b) tDCS
exceeded their expectations.
Opinions about safety: Nearly three-quarters of participants (72.9%) agreed that tDCS is a relatively safe technique; some (21.5%) were not sure, and only a small
number (5.6%) disagreed (i.e., felt that tDCS was not
safe). However, slightly more than half (54.0%) agreed
that tDCS should not be used on children, many were not
sure (39.5%), and only a very small proportion (6.5%)

to be relatively safe, many also have significant reservations about the use of the technology (as indicated by
their views on the acceptability of using tDCS on
children).

public: More than 90% agreed that tDCS should remain
available to the public; this was the strongest consensus

Discussion
This study provides the largest and most comprehensive survey to-date of users of consumer tDCS devices. Although
there have been over a dozen studies of users of pharmacological cognitive enhancement—ranging from large-scale surveys to in-depth focus groups—there is a dearth of empirical
work on how users utilize brain stimulation devices marketed
for cognitive enhancement. The methodology employed here
was unique in that rather than recruiting via an online forum, it
involved partnering with seven companies who sell direct-toconsumer brain stimulation devices; as a result, the sample
was comprised of participants who had purchased a consumer
tDCS device. The majority of respondents reported residing in
North America.
One of the most important unanswered questions regarding
the home use of non-invasive brain stimulation is the prevalence and popularity of the phenomenon. Previously, the closest measure of the popularity of tDCS was the number of
subscribers to the tDCS subreddit forum, which increased
from roughly 1000 subscribers in October 2012 to approximately 10,000 as of October 2017. However, subscribing to
the tDCS subreddit is relatively meaningless, as one can visit
(and post to) the tDCS subreddit without subscribing (Wexler
and Reiner 2017). Thus, the growth in number of subscribers
to the tDCS subreddit should be taken as a proxy for increasing interest in the home use of tDCS, rather than increasing
use of tDCS.
A more accurate—though still highly imperfect—measure
of the extent of the home use of tDCS can be gleaned from the
total number of consumer tDCS devices sold. Indeed, purchasing a device is a financial commitment: it requires not just
clicking Bsubscribe^ on the tDCS subreddit, but actually
spending a significant sum of money on a stimulation device
(on average, participants in the present study paid $177). In
this study, which included seven of the ten companies selling
tDCS devices directly to consumers as of June 2016, companies’ customer lists totaled approximately 10,000 individuals.
As noted above, these lists may have included a small percentage of individuals who purchased accessories (and not devices); on the other hand, some individuals purchased more
than one device. Thus, this figure should be taken as a rough,
ballpark estimate of the number of devices sold across the
seven companies.
Given that response rates were relatively constant (i.e.,
within a few percentage points) across customers from each

of the seven companies, it is likely that the distribution of
tDCS devices across the companies in this study (as shown
in Table 4) represents a rough approximation of the market
distribution across the companies surveyed (e.g., one
dominant company, several medium-sized companies, and a
handful of much smaller ones). Additionally, given my previous work studying the consumer tDCS landscape and knowledge of the three companies who declined to participate—i.e.,
length of time in business, extent of publicity received—it is
possible to speculate that the missing companies have only
medium or small shares of the market. Thus, it is likely that
the total number of consumer tDCS devices sold as of
June 2016 is a relatively low, five-digit figure. It should be
emphasized that this figure does not reflect the total number of
active users of tDCS, as even among the present sample—
which itself may not be representative of all users of consumer
tDCS devices—approximately 40% had quit using tDCS or
had never used it.
Despite the lack of data on the prevalence of the home use
of tDCS, media reports and scholarly articles have reported
that the home use of brain stimulation is increasing and may
become mainstream (Denejkina 2016; Fitz and Reiner 2014).
This characterization is not unique to tDCS: Partridge et al.
(2011) found that 94% of media articles related to the use of
cognitive enhancement drugs characterized the phenomenon
as either Bcommon^ or increasing, despite there being little
evidence to justify such claims. Similar to Jwa (2015)—who
speculated that there Bmay be some hype^ around the estimates of the size of DIY tDCS—I argue that there is little
evidence to support the notion that the home use of tDCS is
increasing. While there was certainly more attention paid to
the movement in 2014 and 2015 (by the media, academia,
regulatory authorities, and others), this should not be taken
to reflect an increase in the use of consumer tDCS devices,
but rather an increase in attention towards those who use
them.
The results of this study suggest that media reports may in
fact be driving individuals to utilize tDCS. The effect of media
attention on interest in tDCS is also evident from increases in
subscribers to the tDCS subreddit that appear immediately
after high-profile media reports (e.g., see http://redditmetrics.
com/r/tDCS following release of Wired article on May 5,
2014, and Radiolab podcast on June 26, 2014). The role of
the media in Binciting^ individuals to turn to cognitive
enhancement has also been suggested in the context of
pharmacological enhancement (Forlini and Racine 2009;
Outram 2010). Indeed, it is possible that there is an amplification effect when it comes to media reports and uptake of
tDCS: media attention may lead to an increase in reports from
a variety of outlets (i.e., additional media, academic scholarship, conferences, and meetings), which in turn may drive
further media attention as press outlets report that Bexperts^
are discussing the phenomenon, which may in turn drive more

J Cogn Enhanc (2018) 2:114–134

individuals to utilize tDCS. Further research is needed to better elucidate the possibility of this effect.
Overall, those who own consumer tDCS devices tend to be
highly educated, wealthy, and politically liberal; they are early
adopters of technology with a penchant for reading scientific
articles. Most do not attend religious services; this finding is
particularly salient given that a recent Pew report found that
Americans who were more religious were less likely to report
being comfortable with the use of hypothetical future enhancement technologies (Pew Research Center 2016b).
Although the hypothetical enhancement technologies presented in the Pew study (synthetic blood transfusions, brain chip
implants, gene editing) are far more invasive than tDCS, this
study—which found that consumers of tDCS devices are less
religious than the US population—suggests that religiosity
may be a factor in individual willingness to adopt even less
invasive enhancement technologies such as tDCS. Indeed, a
study comparing Swiss student users of cognitive enhancement drugs to non-users found that a higher percentage of
users were not affiliated with any religion, and that more users
than non-users rated religion as Bnot important^ (Ott and
Biller-Andorno 2014).
In one sense, the finding that participants are in higher
income brackets relative to the US population can be expected, as those in lower income brackets likely do not have spare
funds to spend on an experimental technique of questionable
efficacy, and a similar income distribution would be expected
for those who opt for other expensive enhancement techniques
(e.g., cosmetic surgery). Still, Fig. 3 may provide empirical
support for concerns expressed by bioethicists regarding distributive justice (i.e., that enhancement technologies may be
used by those who are wealthier, thereby increasing current
inequality gaps). An alternative interpretation of the figure,
however, is that tDCS users are relatively well-distributed
across income brackets, and that it is the US income distribution that is skewed.
The most surprising demographic finding was a far higher
mean age (45.3) than expected, as home users have typically
been portrayed as being in their twenties and thirties (Jwa
2015; Wexler 2016b). This difference cannot be sufficiently
explained by variations in recruitment between the present
study and previous ones (which recruited via online avenues,
mainly the tDCS subreddit) as the mean age of visitors to the
tDCS subreddit (43.9 years) and non-visitors (46.9 years)
were both relatively high. It is therefore likely that the mean
age of home users has shifted over time—the extensive media
coverage in 2014 and 2015 may have attracted a group of
slightly older individuals, especially those interested in treatment or restoration—and thus a phenomenon that was initially
dominated by younger individuals is now more evenly distributed across generations.
The higher proportion of females (15.3%) in the present
study as compared to the 4% previously reported by Jwa

131

(2015) is especially interesting, as it suggests while the home
use of tDCS is still a male-dominated activity, more women
are using the technique, especially to self-treat depression.
With regard to geographic distribution, the large number of
respondents based in North America cannot be attributed to
the companies’ locations. Although five of the seven companies participating in this study were based in North America, a
more important measure is the company’s market share: in the
present sample, participants reported owning more devices
from international companies as compared to US-based ones.
Interestingly, the present study found approximately the same
percentage of participants based in North America as Jwa
(2015). The consistency of this result across studies could
reflect a lower prevalence of use of tDCS outside North
America; indeed, a similarly low prevalence of usage of cognitive enhancement drugs has been suggested for those outside North America (Ragan et al. 2013).
With regard to purpose of use, approximately one-quarter
of participants reported purchasing tDCS out of curiosity and
interest in experimentation (on the open-ended response); indeed, a recent study on the use of neuroenhancement drugs in
England also found curiosity to be a motivating factor for a
subset of users (Vargo and Petróczi 2016). Thus, some individuals are not driven by a specific purpose (i.e., treatment or
enhancement) but rather are curious about the latest technology, which is line with the finding that most participants reported being early adopters of technology. Furthermore, the
border between treatment and enhancement indications is not
always clear-cut. Indeed, coding participants’ responses to the
open-ended response questions—as either treatment or enhancement—was challenging, particularly with regard to indications for attention (i.e., is using tDCS to improve focus/
concentration meaningfully different for those who mentioned
a diagnosis of ADD vs. those who did not) and mood disorders (where some participants reported using tDCS to improve
the cognitive sluggishness that often accompanies depression). Additionally, on the forced-choice questions, a large
percentage of participants selected multiple indications (treatment/enhancement/restoration).
The number of participants who reported using tDCS for
depression is particularly striking: put in perspective, of all
individuals who purchased and used a tDCS device on themselves at least once (n = 308), approximately one-third
(31.5%; n = 97) have used it specifically to treat depression—despite the fact that almost all consumer tDCS devices
are marketed for enhancement, not treatment. The population
of home users self-treating for depression merits further study,
especially as tDCS has been viewed as a potentially promising
at-home treatment for depression.
Regarding efficacy, one of the most notable findings is that
those who have used tDCS for treatment rate the technology
as more effective than those who used it for non-treatment
purposes (i.e., only enhancement and/or restoration). One

132

explanation is that tDCS may actually be more effective when
used for treatment as opposed to enhancement/restoration; this
possibility is line with current reports in the tDCS literature,
which suggest that the effects of tDCS may be stronger for
depression than for other disease or cognitive enhancement
indications (Horvath et al. 2015; Lefaucheur et al. 2017).
Another possibility is that the effects of stimulation may be
more pronounced for treaters than non-treaters (who are using
tDCS only for enhancement and/or restoration); in other
words, a small percentage increase on a cognitive domain—
if one does exist—may not be apparent to the average nontreater; whereas symptom relief from depression may be more
salient. A third possibility is that tDCS is not effective for
either purpose, but that there is a greater placebo effect for
those who use it for treatment than for those who use it for
only enhancement and/or restoration. The findings here suggest that bioethical concerns with regard to tDCS for enhancement may not be pressing; indeed, only a third of participants
who utilize tDCS purely for non-treatment purposes found it
to be effective. Thus, more pertinent ethical issues may arise
with regard to the home use of tDCS for treatment, particularly
for depression.
Safety, or the potential harm to users, is the most widely
discussed topic in the literature related to the home use of
tDCS. The unwanted effects reported by participants in the
present study are consistent with the typical side effects reported in the tDCS literature (Antal et al. 2017). That a small
number of subjects report persistent burns is in line with several reports of Bskin lesions^ in the tDCS literature that have
occurred while tDCS is being administered by trained professionals in laboratory settings (Matsumoto and Ugawa 2017;
Rodríguez et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2015). Thus, it should not
necessarily be concluded that users had skin burns/lesions
because they Bmisused^ tDCS, as such burns/lesions have
occurred in controlled laboratory settings. Still, reports of severe burns, even among a small number of participants, are
concerning. The present study found that while home users
generally adhere to scientific protocols with regard to current
level and length of session, they depart from them most notably with regard to frequency of stimulation, with many users
stimulating far more frequently than in scientific studies of
tDCS. Overall, the present study suggests that rather than focusing on abstract notions of Bsafety^ and Brisk^ with regard
to the home use of tDCS, two specific concerns warrant attention: severe burns and frequency of stimulation.
The methodology employed here allowed for the examination of the population of users who have stopped using tDCS;
results showed that a significant number of users (~ 40%) stop
using tDCS (or have never used it), with the most common
reason for quitting being lack of efficacy. Thus, it is not side
effects or concern about long-term effects that are driving
individuals away from tDCS, rather it is the fact that they
are not experiencing benefits from the technique. This finding,

J Cogn Enhanc (2018) 2:114–134

combined with the dearth of data on prevalence, indicate that
bioethical concerns regarding explicit or implicit coercion in
the realm of tDCS may not be relevant, as the home use of
tDCS—at least in its current incarnation—is not a technique
that individuals, especially those who utilize it for nontreatment purposes, find to be overwhelmingly effective (see
also Voarino et al. 2017).
Although previous studies have focused on the tDCS
subreddit (and related online tDCS sources), the present study
found that approximately one-third of respondents had never
heard of the tDCS subreddit, and it total, more than half had
never visited. Even among those who had visited, the vast
majority were lurkers who never or rarely posted to the forum.
Thus, the tDCS subreddit should not be taken to be representative of home users of tDCS.
The study had a number of limitations. First, the aggregate
response rate (3.9%) was relatively low, which raises issues
regarding the representativeness of the sample. However, response rates were relatively similar (within a few percentage
points) across all seven companies, and a low response rate
was expected given that participants were not offered incentives for participation. Second, the study was based on selfreport measures; no independent verification was conducted
to ensure that participants had purchased and used tDCS devices. However, additional checks were performed on the data
to ensure that those coming from each company’s unique link
reported purchasing a device from that company. Third, although former users (and those who had never used tDCS)
were encouraged to complete the survey (in recruitment
emails), it is likely that respondents skewed towards being
active users of tDCS or former users who had negative experiences with the device. Fourth, the study focused only on
those individuals who had purchased direct-to-consumer
tDCS devices, not those who had built their own devices or
those who repurpose iontophoresis devices (although some
participants reported owning these devices). However, as
direct-to-consumer devices have become more affordable
and have improved in quality, it is likely that fewer users today
build their devices from scratch or repurpose iontophoresis
devices, compared to the Bearly days^ of DIY tDCS from
2011 to 2013.
Though the home use of non-invasive brain stimulation has
been a subject of much discussion in the academic literature,
there has been little empirical data on the practices and motivations of home users. This study provides the largest and
most comprehensive survey to-date of users of consumer
tDCS devices. Obtaining a deeper knowledge of what drives
home users—to purchase and use a consumer tDCS device (or
for many, to cease to use it)—has important implications, both
for ongoing debates about the ethical implications of the home
use of tDCS, as well as for discussions of the regulation of
direct-to-consumer neurotechnology. Thus, the present study
not only provides an empirical foundation on which to base

J Cogn Enhanc (2018) 2:114–134

policy recommendations, but also offers a concrete, empirical
perspective on a debate that has too-often been one step removed from reality.
