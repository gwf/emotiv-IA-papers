Objectives
To investigate the effects of knowledge and magnitude of a load (to be lifted) on brain
responses, autonomic nervous activity, and trapezius and erector spinae muscle activity.

Methods
A randomized, within-subjects experiment involving manual lifting was conducted, wherein
10 participants lifted three different weights (1.1, 5, and 15 kg) under two conditions: either
having or not having prior knowledge of the weight to be lifted.

Accepted: February 8, 2021

Results

Published: February 26, 2021

The results revealed that the lifting of unknown weights caused increased average heart
rate and percentage of maximum voluntary contraction (%MVC) but decreased average
inter-beat interval, very-low-frequency power, low-frequency power, and low-frequency/
high-frequency ratio. Regardless of the weight magnitude, lifting of unknown weights was
associated with smaller theta activities in the power spectrum density (PSD) of the central
region, smaller alpha activities in the PSD of the frontal region, and smaller beta activities in
the PSDs of both the frontal and central regions. Moreover, smaller alpha and beta activities
in the PSD of the parietal region were associated only with lifting of unknown lightweights.

Conclusions
Uncertainty regarding the weight to be lifted could be considered as a stress-adding variable

The findings of this study stress the importance of eliminating uncertainty associated with
handling unknown weights, such as in the cases of handling patients and dispatching

luggage. This can be achieved through preliminary self-sensing of the load to be lifted, or
the cautious disclosure of the actual weight of manually lifted objects, for example, through
clear labeling and/or a coding system.

Introduction
Low back pain (LBP) is the most prevalent work-related musculoskeletal disorder and is the
leading cause of disability globally [1–3]. LBP incurs high costs in terms of medical treatment,
lost work time, and low productivity [2, 4]. The severe consequences of LBP have motivated
researchers to investigate its association with various aspects of manual lifting such as load
magnitude, and load knowledge [5–11]. One aspect that is suspected of being highly associated
with the incidence of LBP is the handling of unknown weights, which is common in daily routines either at work or during leisure time [6, 7, 12]. Examples of such situations are patient
handling, luggage dispatching, refuse collecting, and mail distributing. An association between
unexpected loading and LBP has been perceived, suggesting an elevated incidence of LBP
when lifting unknown weights during refuse collecting or luggage handling [6, 7, 12].
Previous studies have investigated trunk muscle responses and spinal loading when lifting
unknown loads and concluded that lifting unknown loads increases the risks of low back
injury and balance loss based on the relationship between lifting unknown loads and increased
trunk mechanical load, alteration of kinematic responses, and increased trunk muscle activities
[6–9, 12–18].
One emerging technique for investigating human performances during physical activities is
measuring brain responses via electroencephalography (EEG) [19–21]. EEG brain signals are
associated with various cognitive and physical states, are sensitive to fluctuations in vigilance,
and are significantly correlated with mental workload [22]. Such techniques consider human
physical, cognitive, and affective capabilities and limitations when controlling and designing
physical tasks [20, 21, 23]. EEG signals are a combination of brain rhythms at different frequency levels that fall into five frequency bands: 1) delta waves (1–3 Hz), 2) theta waves (4–7
Hz), 3) alpha waves (8–12 Hz), 4) beta waves (13–30 Hz), and 5) gamma waves (31–50 Hz).
Researchers have been investigating the emergence of activity within each frequency level
and the associated physical and/or mental activity with the purpose of diagnosing, monitoring
and assessing illnesses and human performance [24, 25]. Generally, delta waves are associated
with unconsciousness, deep sleep, or catalepsy; theta waves are associated with creativity, spontaneity, distractibility, inattention, daydreaming, depression, and anxiety; alpha waves are
associated with physical and mental relaxation as well as awareness of one’s surroundings; beta
waves are associated with focusing, analysis, conscious alertness, tension, and fear; and gamma
waves are associated with problem solving, learning, and facing cognitive challenges [24, 25].
Previous studies have indicated that activation of the brain in the frontal lobe can be used as
a cognitive workload indicator [26]. The fluctuations in the power of both theta and alpha
bands are associated with the performance of memory and complex cognitive [27, 28].
Decreased alpha band activities are associated with higher cognitive demands [29, 30]. Additionally, increased beta band power in both frontal and central lobes is associated with
increased mental effort [31].
For the θ, α, β, and γ bands in the frontal, central, and parietal areas, the EEG power spectrum density (PSD) during medium load lifting tasks were found to be significantly greater
than during low load lifting tasks, implying an increase in attention [32]. Cognitive processes

such as self-monitoring were found to be associated with increased workload in the form of
increased power in the waves in the 4–13 Hz range, which are associated with alert functioning
[33].
Another emerging technique for investigating human performance during physical activities is the monitoring of heart rate variability (HRV), which represents the periodic variations
in the heart rate (HR), and is an indicator of the activity level of the cardiovascular autonomic
function [34]. HRV depends on age, body mass index, sex, diet, and physical and mental activity [35, 36]. The HRV indices used for analysis come from both the time and frequency
domains. The indices from the time domain are the average inter-beat (RR) interval (mRR),
average heart rate (mHR), standard deviation of normal-to-normal RR intervals (SDNN), root
mean square of successive differences in RR intervals (RMSSD), number of pairs of successive
RR intervals that differ by more than 50 ms (NN50), and proportion of NN50 divided by the
total number of RR intervals (pNN50). The indices from the frequency domain are the PSD in
the very-low-frequency band (VLF = 0–0.04 Hz), low-frequency band (LF = 0.04–0.15 Hz),
and high-frequency band (HF = 0.15–0.4 Hz), and the total power (TP = 0–0.4 Hz). The HF
power have been associated with vagal activity [37], and the LF/HF ratio is an indicator of sympathetic–parasympathetic balance [38]. Theoretically, the HF component is more sensitive to
physical effort and is lower during physical tasks, the LF component is sensitive to overall
strain (either physical or mental, but is typically higher for mental stress), and the LF/HF ratio
indicates autonomic balance (for any kind of activity) [36, 38–40].
To the best of our knowledge, the lifting of unknown loads based on brain’s EEG or HRV
responses during regular daily activities has not been investigated. Investigating the EEG
responses to lifting unknown loads should reveal the contributions of the brain during such
daily activities, rather than simply focusing on peripheral outcomes such as forces and muscle
activity. Investigating HRV responses during the lifting of unknown loads should also elucidate cardiovascular autonomic functions during such tasks. The objective of this study was to
investigate the effects of knowledge and magnitude of a load (to be lifted) on brain responses,
autonomic nervous activity, and trapezius and erector spinae muscle activity.

Materials and methods
The study was approved by the Human Participants Review Sub-committee of the Institutional
Review Board of King Saud University, College of Medicine, and King Khalid University Hospital (ID: E-19-4467).

Experimental design
A repeated-measures design, with two independent variables and three response variables was
used in this study. The independent variables were weight knowledge with two levels (known
weight and unknown weight) and weight magnitude with three levels (1.1 kg, 5 kg, and 15 kg),
resulting in six experimental conditions corresponding to the six combinations of the independent variables’ levels, which were assigned in a completely randomized order. The dependent
variables were the PSDs of the four EEG bands (α, β, θ, and γ), HRV, and muscle activity as a
percent of maximum voluntary contraction (%MVC) for the trapezius and erector spinae
muscles.

Participants
Ten healthy male university students with a mean age (standard deviation) of 30.5 (1.21) years,
a mean height of 168.7 (2.64) cm, and a mean weight of 75.18 (8.37) kg voluntarily participated
in this study. None of the participants had experience in manual lifting tasks, and none had a

history of neurological disorders, back pain, or any other musculoskeletal injury. All participants signed a consent form approved by the Human Participants Review Sub-committee of
the Institutional Review Board of King Saud University, College of Medicine, and King Khalid
University Hospital (ID: E-19-4467).

Equipment
Three two-handled boxes (39cm×27cm×19cm) were used for the lifting loads. An eight-channel Biomonitor ME6000, MT-ECG-1 preamplifier, four-channel EEG amplifier for the
ME6000, and the Mega Win3.0.1 software (Mega Electronics Ltd., Kuopio, Finland) were used
to record physiological signals (four channels to record EEG signals, two channels to record
electrocardiography (ECG) signals, and two channels to record electromyography (EMG) signals). An EMOTIV EEG headset was used for holding the EEG electrodes in place. In addition,
the Kubios HRV Software v2.2 (University of Western Finland, Finland) was used to compute
the HRV.

Physiological response measurements
EMG response measure. Standard procedures were followed for the placement of the Ag/
AgCl solid adhesive pre-gelled electrodes on the right erector spinae and middle trapezius
muscles of the participants. EMG signals were recorded at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. Lowfrequency artefacts were removed using a band-pass filter with a frequency range of 20–500
Hz. A 50 Hz notch filter was then used to remove the 50 Hz power line interference in the
recorded EMG signals. Muscle activities during maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) for
the two muscles investigated were recorded, to be used for normalizing the muscle activities
recorded under the experimental conditions.
ECG response measure. Three ECG Ag/AgCl electrodes were placed on the participants’
chests to reduce the occurrence of muscle contraction artefacts during lifting. The ECG signals
were recorded at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The Kubios HRV Software v2.2 was used for processing the ECG signals [41]. Then both time domain parameters and frequency domain
parameters of the HRV were calculated [time domain parameters: mRR, mHR, standard deviation of all RR intervals (SDRR), standard deviation of the mRR intervals in all segments of the
recordings (SDHR), RMSSD, NN50, and pNN50; frequency domain parameters: VLF, LF, HF,
and LF/HF]. Power is calculated as time squared in milliseconds divided by frequency in Hertz
(ms2/Hz).
EEG response measure. The international standards of the 10–20 for EEG electrode
placement was followed [42]. EEG signals were recorded from the right side of the head at
three positions: 1) F4: frontal cortex which is responsible for attention, judgment, and motor
planning, 2) Fc6: central cortex which is responsible for the sensorimotor system, and 3) P8:
parietal region, where cognitive processing occurs. The EEG signals were amplified and
recorded at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The recorded EEG signals were visually monitored at
all times for any suspicious artefacts. For the purpose of artefact removal, EEG signals associated with specific predetermined body movements (explained in the Experimental Procedures
sub-section) was separately recorded to be used later in the artefact subspace reconstruction
method implemented to remove nonstationary high-variance signals from the recorded raw
EEG signals during performing the experimental tasks and to rebuild any missing data using a
spatial mixing matrix, assuming volume conduction [43]. Next, a low-pass four-pole elliptic
filter with a cut-off frequency of 50 Hz was used to remove the power line noise and any other
high-frequency noise. The filtered EEG signals were then separated into their individual bands
(θ, α, β, and γ) using a multilevel discrete wavelet transform. A digital FFT-based power

spectrum analysis (Welch technique, Hanning windowing function, no phase shift) was used
to compute the PSD of EEG rhythms with a 1 Hz frequency resolution, ranging from 0.5 to 50
Hz. The calculated PSDs of the four bands θ, α, β, and γ are the response variables in the three
selected regions.

Experimental procedures
Each participant received a clear description of the objectives of the study and then signed a
consent form. The participants’ demographic data, age, and anthropometric dimensions were
collected. They were then equipped with the ECG, EEG, and EMG systems and prepared for
the experiment. Then muscle activities at the MVC for both the erector spinae muscle and the
middle trapezius muscle were recorded. A five-minute EEG signal containing artefacts was
next recorded. Artefacts include eye blinking, chewing, and body motion such as arm, leg, and
head movements, and physical tasks such as lifting (1-minute eye closed, one-minute eye
blinking, one-minute chewing, one-minute face and arm movements, and one minute performing lifting task). These signals were used during data analysis to remove such artefacts
from the EEG signals.
Participants were instructed on how to perform squat lifting. The lifting experiment started
with each participant squat lifting a box from the floor to a height of 70 cm in the sagittal plan.
The perpendicular distance between the line connecting the medial malleoli and the projected
center of mass of the lifted box was maintained constant at 45 cm across all experimental conditions. Three identical boxes, with the three different weights of interest, were used to eliminate the possibility that the participants could anticipate the box weight. The box was changed
randomly six times for the six lifts. In three of the lifts, the participants were told the
box weight before lifting. A two-minute rest followed each trial to minimize fatigue.

Statistical analysis
A Two-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA was performed to assess the main and interaction
effects of the independent variables at a significance level of α � 0.05. Post-hoc tests were used
to further analyze significant main effects of the weight magnitude factor with Bonferroni
adjustments for multiple comparisons. For significant interaction effects, paired t-test comparisons were performed to independently assess the effects of weight knowledge at each weight
magnitude level and weight magnitude at each weight knowledge level. Both Shapiro Wilk and
Kolmogorov-Smirnova tests of normality were performed for all the response data under all
the experimental conditions to assure that the normality assumption is satisfied. In addition,
Mauchly’s test of Sphericity was performed for all the response data under all the experimental
conditions to assure that the homogeneity of variance assumption is satisfied. Whenever the
homogeneity of variance assumption was not satisfied, Greenhouse-Geisser correction to the
degrees of freedom was considered to adjust for the lack of sphericity. The statistical analysis
was performed using SPSS Version 23.

Results
Both Shapiro Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnova tests of normality were not significant for all
the response data under all the experimental conditions implying that the normality assumption is satisfied. In addition, Mauchly’s test of Sphericity was not significant for all the reported
significant effects implying that the homogeneity of variance assumption is satisfied except for
the weight magnitude main effects for the %MVC of the erector spinae and the GreenhouseGeisser correction to the degrees of freedom was considered as reported in the following
results.

EMG response measure
For the trapezius muscle, the interaction between weight knowledge and weight magnitude
had a significant effect on the %MVC [F(2,18) = 5.1, p<0.018, η2 = 0.36]. A simple effects analysis revealed that at both the 1.1 kg and the 15 kg weights, the %MVC of the trapezius muscle
was significantly higher for the unknown weights than for the known weights [p<0.001 and
p<0.005, respectively]. For the known condition, the %MVC of the trapezius muscle was significantly lower for the 1.1 kg than for both the 5 kg and the 15 kg weights, [p<0.0001 and
p<0.0001, respectively], and for the 5 kg than for the 15 kg weights [p<0.0001]. For the
unknown condition, the %MVC of the trapezius muscle was significantly higher for the 15 kg
weight than for both the 1.1 kg and the 5 kg weights, [p<0.003 and p<0.003, respectively]. The
means, standard deviations (SD), p-values, and effect sizes (η2) of the %MVC of both the trapezius and the erector spinae muscles are summarized in Table 1.
The means and standard errors of the %MVC of the trapezius muscle are represented in Fig 1.
Weight magnitude had a significant effect on the %MVC of the erector spinae muscle [F
(1.23,11.68) = 18.9, p<0.001, η2 = 0.68]. The post-hoc analysis revealed that the %MVC of the
erector spinae muscle was significantly higher for 1) the 15 kg weight compared to both the 1.1
kg and the 5 kg weights [p<0.001 and p<0.004, respectively] and 2) the 5 kg weight compared
to the 1.1 kg weight [p<0.011]. Weight knowledge also had a significant effect on the %MVC
of the erector spinae muscle [F (1,9) = 6.2, p<0.035, η2 = 0.41], where lifting unknown weights
was associated with a higher %MVC.

ECG responses
For the HRV indices in the time domain, weight knowledge had a significant effect on both
the mRR [F(1,9) = 10.86, p<0.009, η2 = 0.55] and the mHR [F(1,9) = 8.5, p<0.017, η2 = 0.49].
Lower mRR values and higher mHR values were associated with lifting unknown weights.
Weight magnitude had a significant effect on the mHR [F(2,18) = 4.35, p<0.029, η2 = 0.33].
The post-hoc analysis revealed that the mHR was significantly lower for the 1.1 kg weight than
for the 15 kg weight [p<0.044]. Weight magnitude had no significant effect on the mRR.
Weight knowledge, weight magnitude, and their interactions also had no significant effect on
the SDRR, SDHR, RMSSD, NN50, or pNN50.
For the HRV indices in the frequency domain, the interaction between weight knowledge
and weight magnitude had a significant effect on VLF power [F(2,18) = 4.17, p<0.033, η2 =
0.32]. The simple effects analysis revealed that at the 1.1 kg weight condition, the VLF power
was significantly higher for the known weight than for the unknown weight [p<0.004]. Under
the known weight condition, the VLF power was also significantly higher for the 1.1 kg weight
than for both the 5 kg and the 15 kg weights [p<0.029 and p<0.002, respectively]. The means
and standard errors of the VLF power are represented in Fig 2.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247442.g001

Weight knowledge had a significant effect on both the LF power [F(1,9) = 7.31, p<0.024, η2
= 0.45] and the LF/HF ratio [F (1,9) = 8.94, p<0.015, η2 = 0.5]. Both the LF power, and the LF/
HF ratio were significantly lower when lifting unknown weights than when lifting known
weights. These results revealed that lifting unknown weights decreases VLF power, LF power,
and LF/HF ratio compared to lifting known weights.
Weight magnitude had a significant effect on the LF power [F(2,18) = 5.85, p<0.011, η2 =
0.39]. The post-hoc analysis revealed that the LF power was significantly higher for the 1.1 kg
weight than for the 15 kg weight [p<0.032]. Weight magnitude also had a significant effect on
the LF/HF ratio [F(2,18) = 9.13, p<0.002, η2 = 0.5]. The post-hoc analysis revealed that the LF/
HF ratio was significantly higher for the 1.1 kg weight than for the 15 kg weight [p<0.004].
Weight knowledge, weight magnitude, and their interaction had no significant effect on the
HF power. The means, standard deviations (SD), p-values, and effect sizes (η2) of the heart rate
variability (HRV) indices are summarized in Table 2.

EEG response
The interaction between weight knowledge and weight magnitude had a significant effect on
the β band PSD of the parietal region of the brain [F(2,18) = 4.46, p<0.027, η2 = 0.33]. The simple effects analysis revealed that at the 1.1 kg weight condition, the β band PSD of the parietal
region was significantly lower for the unknown weight than for the known weight [p<0.014].
Under the unknown condition, the β band PSD of the parietal region was also significantly
lower for the 1.1 kg weight than for the 15 kg weight [p<0.049]. Means and standard errors of
the β band PSD of the parietal region are represented in Fig 3.

Weight knowledge, weight magnitude, and their interactions had no significant effect on

The means, standard deviations (SD), p-values, and effect sizes (η2) of the power spectrum
density (PSD) of the four EEG bands in the three brain regions are summarized in Table 3. All
significant contrasts are summarized in Tables 4–6.

Discussions
This study investigated the brain EEG’s PSDs, cardiovascular autonomic functions and muscle
activity responses associated with two factors of interest, which were weight magnitude with
three levels representing light, medium, and heavy weights, and weight knowledge. In this
study, for the erector spinae muscle, higher muscle activities were associated with lifting
greater weight magnitudes and with lifting unknown weights, as expected and as indicated in
the literature [2, 7, 9, 13, 14]. The interaction between both factors was not, however, influential. These results imply that the erector spinae muscle activities will increase with increased
loading, regardless of whether these loads are known or not. Similarly, the erector spinae muscle activities will increase with uncertainty about the loads being lifted regardless of whether
these loads are light, medium, or heavy.

For the trapezius muscle, the interaction between both factors of interest was significant
where higher muscle activities were associated with lifting unknown weights under the light
and heavy conditions of the weight magnitude factor but not the medium weight condition.
This finding implies an added workload to the task due to an uncertainty about the magnitude
of the load to be lifted when associated with lifting light loads or heavy loads but not medium
loads. In industrial settings, although the lifted loads might be within certain acceptable value
according to NIOSH lifting equation, we suspect that uncertainty might induce some sort of
additional mental workload that, in conjunction with the presented physical workload due to
the amount of load lifted, might push the task demands beyond the capabilities and probably
exceeding the limitations of the workers.
This may suggest that with an uncertainty about the magnitude of the load, the trapezius
muscle approaches the lifting task with an activation level that is pre-set to a medium load value.
When the expectation matches the reality of the lifted load, knowledge makes no difference, but
when the actually lifted weight is different (either higher or lower), the trapezius muscle response
manifested itself in the form of higher activation, implying increased loading of the muscle. By
investigating the differences among load levels under each knowledge condition separately, it
was found that higher trapezius muscle activities were associated with higher load levels.
The results of HRV measures revealed that an increase in the mHR values and decrease in
mRR values, VLF power, LF power, and LF/HF ratio are associated with lifting unknown and
heavier weights. The increase in physical demand imposed by increasing the load magnitude
and not knowing the weight to be lifted manifested itself in the form of significant changes in
the above HRV parameters. These results introduce the HRV as a valuable tool for the monitoring, and assessment of human performance [34–37, 39].
The findings of this research suggest a decrease in the LF power as a result of increasing the
physical demand, which is in agreement with the findings of Kamath et al. [39] and Perini and
Veicsteinas [40], but is in contrast to the findings of Satya [36] and Tarvainen et al. [38]. Similarly, the LF/HF ratio decreased as a result of increasing the physical demand, which is in contrast to Kamath et al. [39], Satya [36], and Tarvainen et al. [38]. The contradiction in the
results obtained can be justified by the fact that in the current research, the level of physical
demand is considerably lower, being six lifts for the entire manual lifting session compared to
the load and duration of the other studies. The manner in which participants responded systemically to lifting the unknown weights resulted in an increase in autonomic activities, especially in the cases of heavier weights.
In this study, the lifting of unknown weights was associated with a smaller θ band PSD of
the central region, a smaller α band PSD of the frontal region, and a smaller β band PSD of
both the frontal and the central regions, regardless of the weight magnitude. In addition,
smaller β band PSD values for the parietal region was associated only with lifting unknown
light weights. Lifting objects of unknown weight can increase the activation of the sensorimotor areas of the brain, particularly for weights of lower magnitudes, as a result of central adaptation counteraction. These findings are consistent with those in the literature regarding

Psychophysiological responses to manual lifting of unknown loads

decreased PSD values for various EEG bands (in the frontal, parietal, and central regions) associated with increased workloads [32, 33, 44–46].
When lifting unknown weights, humans tend to speculate regarding their magnitude to initiate neuromuscular coordination that produces a suitable muscle recruitment strategy to control the load and maintain balance. The resulting forces are typically different from the actual
forces required [6, 7, 12–14, 18, 47, 48]. Speculations regarding load magnitude, in conjunction with feedback obtained at the initiation of lifting, may be explained by the variability in
the PSD of the EEG bands and the HRV.
The results of this research are limited to the specific lifting conditions in this experiment
which were one lift, sagittal plan, floor-to-knuckle lifting. That notwithstanding, this research
opens the door for investigating interactions related to weight knowledge under more fatiguing lifting conditions (lifting frequency, lifting duration, lifting postures, lifting heights, lifting
technique, package size, and shape). Another limitation of this study is that the participants
were all male college students with no experience in manual lifting tasks. Investigating a
broader spectrum of the population would result in a reliable generalization of our findings.

Conclusion
Uncertainty about the load to be lifted can be considered as a stress-adding variable in manual
lifting tasks. Not knowing the weight to be lifted can trigger the muscles involved in the lifting
process to respond accordingly, with greater muscle activation. This increase in the muscle
activity reflects an increase in the physical demand that is required to be sustained during
manual lifting.
The systemic response to lifting unknown weight results in different autonomic activities,
especially with heavier weights. Lifting unknown weights also requires the utilization of more
brain activity in sensorimotor areas, particularly at lower weight magnitudes, as a result of the
central adaptation counteraction and speculation about the load magnitude.
Deploying EEG devices to investigate the neural responses to physical demands can provide
opportunities for novel, less invasive methods of monitoring human performance. These
methods are equally effective compared to traditional methods and produce reliable results.
The findings of this study stress the importance of eliminating the uncertainty associated
with handling unknown loads such as in patient handling, luggage dispatching, refuse collecting, and mail distributing. This can be achieved through preliminary self-sensing of the load to
be lifted, or the cautious disclosure of the actual weight of manually lifted objects, for example,
through clear labeling and/or a coding system.
