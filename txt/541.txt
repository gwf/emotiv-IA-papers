Abstract
A previously reported experiment collected electrocortical data recorded
simultaneously in pairs of people separated by distance. Reanalysis of those
data confirmed the presence of a time-synchronous, statistically significant
correlation in brain electrical activity of these distant “sender-receiver” pairs.
Given the sensory shielding employed in the original experiment to avoid
mundane explanations for such a correlation, this outcome is suggestive of an
anomalous intersubjective connection.

Introduction
Giroldini et al. (2016) reported an experiment where pairs of
people isolated by distance each had 14-channel electroencephalograms (EEGs) recorded simultaneously (Emotiv EPOC+,
San Francisco, CA). The “sender” (S) of each pair was exposed
to 128 stimulus epochs per test session, where each epoch
consisted of a one-second exposure to a light or sound stimulus
(the latter presented over earbuds). Using a whole brain EEG
coherence metric, Giroldini et al. found that after 25 experimental sessions that the “receiver’s” (R) electrocortical coherence
increased during the stimulus epochs. This was interpreted as a
reflection of a “nonlocal” connection between S and R. The effect
was primarily observed in the EEG alpha band of 8 – 12 Hz, with
a statistically stronger effect reported in the range of 9 – 10 Hz. To
double-check how robust the reported effect might be, this study
developed a simpler correlational approach and applied it to the
original, unfiltered EEG data.

Methods
The raw EEG data from Giroldini et al. (2016) was obtained
from: doi, 10.6084/m9.figshare.1466876.v8 (Tressoldi, 2016).
Matlab (R2013a) scripts were written to conduct the analysis.
These scripts may be obtained from: 10.6084/m9.figshare.4954643.
v2 (Radin, 2017).
To process the raw EEG data, first use the script readEEG.m
(this uses the function importfile1.m), then put all of the newly
processed files (in Matlab’s .mat format) into a single folder and
run the script EEG_xcorr_raw.m in that folder. This will create
Giroldini’s et al.’s brain coherence metrics for each pair of participants. Finally, run the script EEG_analysis_Radin.m, which will
analyze those files and generate results in graph form.
As a brief description of the method, the processing scripts
follow Giroldini et al.’s method for creating a whole brain coherence metric for each S and R datafile. The scripts then create an
ensemble median of this metric plus and minus one second from
stimulus onset. A Pearson correlation is then formed between the
ensemble median curves for S and R pairs. The two-tailed p-value
associated with that correlation is transformed into a one-tailed
z score using an inverse normal transform. Then a nonparametric
permutation analysis is used to determine the probability associated with that z score (i.e., this z is not distributed as a standard
normal deviate because its variance is inflated due to the autocorrelated nature of EEG data). The p-value resulting from the
permutation analysis is converted into a standard normal deviate
(this is now a conventional z score). The same process is used

on the remaining 24 pairs of EEG data. The final step combines the
25 z scores into a Stouffer Z = ∑zs/5, where Z is distributed as a
standard normal deviate.

Results
The above procedure results in a Stouffer Z = 2.705, p = 0.006
(two-tailed). Four of the 25 sessions are independently significant at p < .05 (two-tailed); all four of those sessions had positive
S-R correlations.
To check if this S-R relationship is in time-synchrony, the Matlab
script circular shifts each R’s EEG coherence signal -2 seconds,
and then repeats the entire analytical procedure to determine the
overall Stouffer Z score. Then R’s coherence signal is shifted to
the right by 100 msec, reanalyzed, and this is repeated until
reaching a lag of +2 seconds. If the original S-R correlation
was synchronized in time, then we would expect to see the peak
result at lag 0. Figure 1 shows that this was indeed the case.
Figure 1 also shows a significantly negative deviation at a lag of
900 msec post-stimulus. Because this analysis is based on the
absolute magnitude and not the direction of the correlation, this
decline indicates that the S-R correlation strength declined below
chance-expected levels about 1second post-stimulus. This may
reflect a drop in electrocortical coherence in S generated by the
explicit presentation of a stimulus; thus, during that time, the magnitude of the S-R correlation would be expected to momentarily

drop. If similar negative correlations are observed in future experiments of this type, it may prove to be a useful secondary indicator
of a genuine S-R relationship.

Data availability
The raw EEG data from Giroldini et al. (2016) was obtained
from: doi, 10.6084/m9.figshare.1466876.v8 (Tressoldi, 2016).

Conclusion
Analysis of previously collected EEG data showed a significant
time-synchronized correlation between the electrocortical activity
of “sender” and “receiver” pairs. Because the data were collected
under conditions where participants were isolated by shielding and
distance, this outcome is suggestive of a “nonlocal” mind-to-mind
interaction.

The statistical method seems to be the correct one if we consider each experimental session
corresponding to an S-R pair as a separate experiment.
The study is very concise and on the subject, and the results comes from a logical thinking that is
materialized in a mathematical method, perfectly adapted to the purpose pursued. Well done work.
Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?
Yes
Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?
Yes
Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?
Yes
If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?
Yes
Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?
Yes
Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?
Yes

This is a brief research note that is under review. It refers to an independent reanalysis of data from
another research group was done for a controversial study on non-local consciousness. The reanalysis
used a non-parametric permutation. The only thing that I do not understand clearly is the results. It
appears that the results of 25 session (different subject pairs) divulged a significant p-value of p = 0.006 in
a group analysis. Next, it is explained that four out of the 25 sessions were independently significant at
p<0.05 two tailed. I am a bit confused. I guess this means the greatest significance was seen at the
group level, and at the subject level only four subject pairs showed significance. I am not sure I am
understanding this correctly. Please make sure it is very explicitly stated to avoid the confusion I have
had.

Yes, that is correct. The p value of p = 0.006 is a group analysis over all 25 sessions. When
examining individual sessions 4 were independently significant at p < 0.05. It is noteworthy that
this latter outcome is unexpected by chance because the binomial probability of 4 or more
significant (at p < 0.05) sessions out of 24 is associated with p = 0.03. What this suggests is that
while some of the other sessions did not quite reach the (conventional) threshold for significance,

while some of the other sessions did not quite reach the (conventional) threshold for significance,
on average they contributed results in the same direction, thus leading to the overall stronger
statistical outcome for all data combined.
