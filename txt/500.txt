Objective. The study assesses the changes in electroencephalography (EEG) power spectral density of individuals in hypoxia when
wearing a diﬀerent type of safety shoes under diﬀerent lifting frequencies. It also assesses the EEG response behavior induced via the
process of lifting loads related to these variables. Methods. The study was conducted in two consecutive phases: training and
acclimatization phase and experimental lifting phase. Ten male college students participated in this study. A four-way repeated
measures design was used in this research with independent variables: ambient oxygen content (“15%, 18%, and 20%”), safety
shoes type (“light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty”), lifting frequency (“1 and 4 lifts/min”), and replication (“ﬁrst and
second”). And the dependent variables were alpha, theta, beta, gamma, θ/α, θ/β, α/β, β/α, (θ + α)/β, and (θ + α)/(α + β). The
participant was allowed to determine his maximum acceptable weight of lift (MAWL) in ﬁfteen minutes of lifting using
psychophysically technique. Then, he continued lifting the MAWL for another ﬁve minutes, where all the data were collected.
Results. Results showed that the EEG responses at lower levels of the independent variables were signiﬁcantly high than at
higher levels; except for oxygen content, the EEG responses at lower levels were considerably lower than at a higher level. It also
showed that an upsurge in the physical demand increased lifting frequency and replication and caused decreasing in alpha
power, theta/beta, alpha/beta, (theta + alpha)/beta, (theta + alpha)/(alpha + beta) and increasing in the theta power and the
gamma power. Furthermore, several interactions among independent variables had signiﬁcant eﬀects on the EEG responses.
Conclusion. The EEG implementation for the investigation of neural responses to physical demands allows for the possibility of
newer nontraditional and faster methods of human performance monitoring. These methods provide eﬀective and reliable
results as compared to other traditional methods. This study will safeguard the physical capabilities and possible health risks of
industrial workers. And the applications of these tasks can occur in almost all working environments (factories, warehouses,
airports, building sites, farms, hospitals, oﬃces, etc.) that are at high altitudes. It can include lifting boxes at a packaging line,
handling construction materials, handling patients in hospitals, and cleaning.

1. Introduction
Neuroergonomics refers to the study of brain functions and
structure, behavioral, and cognition output when involved
in diﬀerent physical and cognitive activities [1]. It is widely
recognized in human factors and ergonomics (HFE) ﬁeld
and strives towards the development of the humancompatibility system [2]. It deals with the activity of diﬀerent
neurons (about 86 billion neurons) that are constantly connected through diﬀerent forms of electrical signals [3, 4].

These electrical signals are a combination of brain rhythms
at diﬀerent frequency levels falling into diﬀering frequency,
including delta waves (<4 Hz), theta waves (4–7 Hz), alpha
waves (7–12 Hz), beta waves (12–30 Hz), and gamma waves
(30–50 Hz) [5]. Studies have shown that delta activities are
high during sleep while theta index activities are high on
the early phase of sleepiness [6]. Alpha activities reﬂect a
relaxed attentiveness case and reductions with visual ﬁxation,
stimulation, or concentration [7]. Though, other scholars
have found an increase in the activity of alpha in the drivers

2
of the train who were sleepy suﬃcient to fall asleep when
driving [6, 8]. Moreover, beta activity decreased during
drowsiness and increased due to the attentiveness levels
[9]. Torsvall [10] supposed that alpha activity was the greatest sentient measure that can be used in fatigue detecting,
followed by theta and delta activities. Nevertheless, the activity of delta was more related to the appearance of sleep
proper. These activities are also reported to impact the neuromuscular activities of an individual [11].
Controlling motor activities and muscle movements is
the function of the brain [12, 13]. Studies in physical neuroergonomics conﬁrm that the cerebral cortex is contributing
to smoothing high-speed motor control processes and muscle activation [12, 14]. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the
most common method that used the technique of neuroimaging in neuroergonomics [1]. Electroencephalography is a
noninvasive technique where the electrodes were placed on
the scalp to measure electrical activities for the human brain
[5]. Parasuraman and Rizzo [15] proposed that monitoring
of the brain for ergonomic research requires high-temporal
resolution and must be economical, sensitive, robust, and
unobtrusive. The electroencephalography (EEG) method
meets all of these principles and helps in an eﬃcient analysis
of the capacities in a more challenging real-life condition [16].
Several methods that have been suggested to detect
fatigue using electroencephalography (EEG), for instance,
detection of alpha spindles [17], a process that uses the
combination of all frequencies components of electroencephalography (EEG) to signify alertness level [18]. Most
researchers [19, 20] suggest that classiﬁers can be developed for categorization of the signals that consider the
individual characteristics and can be robustly applied in
a controlled laboratory setting.
Studies [12, 21] have highlighted two algorithms
([θ + α/β and β/α) for the detection of fatigue. The delta
activity is not included in the study due to its reﬂection
of the human sleeping case. Earlier research of Eoh et al.
[9] supposed that the (θ + α)/β is a credible fatigue indicator as it detects the increase in the ratio between the fast
wave and slow-wave activities. Similarly, Jap et al. [22]
reported two algorithms (θ + α)/(α + β) and θ/β for the
detection of fatigue. However, the detection of fatigue has
not been applied to manual working, such as lifting, pulling,
and carrying, which today accounts for the ﬁve primary
causes of injury [23]. Previous work that has been carried
out in the discipline has been central to the medical caretakers and drivers, indicating a research gap [24, 25].
“The amount of oxygen in the air indicates molecules of
oxygen present in the air per volume unit that decreases as
the altitude increases. Furthermore, the pressure of atmospheric signiﬁcantly aﬀects the functions of the human body
because low atmospheric pressure leads to a decrease in partial oxygen pressure [26]. Thus, the change in atmospheric
pressure and the molecular pressure of oxygen are essential
variables aﬀecting oxygen transport and human respiration
in altitude [27]. Many studies have shown that the maximal
workload, as well as the uptake of oxygen, decreases as the
atmospheric pressure and the partial pressure of oxygen
decreases (in another word as altitude increases) [28, 29]”.

And if the oxygen reaching to the cells is scanty, “the
hydrogen will interact with the pyruvic acid and convert it
into lactic acid. This temporary anaerobic metabolism produces a small amount of energy. The accumulation of lactic
acid in the blood and tissue indicates that there is insuﬃcient
amount of oxygen in the mitochondria, which can be due to
hypoxia or lack of blood ﬂow (such as shock) or a mixture
between them [30], If this is prolonged or severe, it can lead
to cell death. Moreover, during activity, performance is determined by the amount of oxygen transferred by the circulatory system to the muscles [31]. And muscle fatigue occurs
when the intensity of the activity is high due to a lack of oxygen enough to get the metabolism and the accumulation of
inorganic phosphate [32, 33]”. Sudden exposure to high altitude leads to increased ventilation as well as heart rate,
“mainly driven by hypoxemia-induced carotid chemoreceptor activation, sympathoexcitation and vagal withdrawal”
[34, 35], “as the increase in heart rate compensates for the
lack of oxygen. And when a person stays in high places for
several days, resting heart output normalizes because of the
lowering in the volume of stroke due to the decrease of
plasma volume because of the hypoxia [36].” However, “after
acclimatization, the heart rate and Ventilation, continue
increased by a sustained sympathetic response driven by
peripheral chemoreceptors sensitized by the persistent hypoxemia” [37, 38].
Additionally, “few studies have evaluated the eﬀect of
shoes during lifting tasks. Aghazadeh and Lu [39] studied
the impact of changing the body’s position by wearing ﬂat
shoes, 5 cm, or 7.6 cm while performing ﬂoor to knuckle
and knuckle to shoulder lifts at maximum lifting capacity.
These ﬁndings suggest that high-heeled shoes might impact
lifting and back injuries. Li et al. [40] studied the inﬂuence
of footwear and ﬂoor slipperiness conditions on material
handling workers who work in various types of footwear.
They concluded that there is a signiﬁcant eﬀect of friction
level on a perceived sense of slipping, the maximum acceptable holding weight, oxygen uptake (VO2), and eﬃciency of
energy. Kim et al. [41] examined the kinematics and characteristics of the lower extremity and trunk using electromyography in the sit-to-stand (STS) job when wearing diﬀerent
high-heeled shoes (1, 4, or 8 cm). The results showed a significant diﬀerence in muscle activity among the diﬀerent highheeled STS conditions”.
Al-Ashaik et al. [23] “assessed the lifting capabilities of
individuals while wearing various safety shoe types in a warm
environment and examined the physiological responses during lifting tasks. They concluded that the safety shoe type
inﬂuenced the physiological responses of the human body.
The study ﬁndings demonstrated the need to account for
the type of safety shoes worn, which is a safety requirement
by most employers when calculating the recommended
weight limits. There is a scarcity of research on the integrated
impact of the discussed variables.” Ghaleb et al. [42] assessed
the lifting capabilities of individuals when wearing diﬀerent
types of safety shoes and concluded that the safety shoe type
did not signiﬁcantly aﬀect HR. Krings et al. [43] studied the
eﬀect of wearing tactical boots and steel-toed work boots, as
required safety guidelines, on oxygen consumption and

BioMed Research International
cardiorespiratory responses during walking. They recommended that manufacturers improve footwear design by
reducing footwear mass to decrease energy expenditures.
From the previous studies, there were many measurements used to evaluate worker behavior during lifting tasks,
for example, EMG, ECG, and rating of perceived exertion.
But still, there is limited research that exists on the physiological demands of lifting tasks at diﬀerent altitudes and lifting
frequencies while wearing safety shoes. Also, there is a lack
of knowledge of how EEG responses associated with lifting
tasks since no study in the literature exists as the authors
know. Thus, the objective of this study is to assess the
changes in electroencephalography (EEG) power spectral
density of individuals while wearing diﬀerent safety shoes
in three diﬀerent levels of hypoxia under diﬀerent lifting
frequencies. It also examines the EEG responses produced
by the lifting tasks associated with the mentioned factors.
Moreover, this psychophysical study examines the following hypothesis: “the oxygen content, worn safety shoes,
lifting frequency, and replication have a signiﬁcant eﬀect
on EEG responses”.

2. Methods and Materials
2.1. Study Design. The experimental study design was used
for assessing the changes in electroencephalography (EEG)
power spectral density of individuals in diﬀerent ambient
oxygen content when wearing a diﬀerent type of safety shoes
under diﬀerent lifting frequencies. Then, a quantitative
approach was applied for the statistical representation of
the results, which are easy to understand and comprehend.
The study design was similar to the one used in an established previous research [23].
2.2. Participants. The study population consists of the male
students enrolled at King Saud University. The random sampling method was used for recruiting ten participants, (aged
24–33 years (mean [SD]: 26.3 [2.53] years), mean height
[SD] 165:1 ½3:01 cm, mean shoulder height [SD] 138:7 ½2:90
 cm, mean knuckle height [SD] 67:55 ½2:03 cm, and mean
weight [SD] 66:63 ½8:04 kg) as per the inclusion criteria.
Before experimenting, the participants were prohibited from
smoking and consuming tea and caﬀeine for approximately
four hours. Siepmann and Kirch (2002) pointed out that caffeine and tea have to be excluded from EEG studies because
they have “signiﬁcant reduction of total EEG power at
fronto-parieto-occipital and central electrode positions of
both hemispheres when the subjects kept their eyes open”
[44]. The medical checkup was held for ensuring that participants did not have any problem concerning skeletal, respiratory, or circulatory systems. The researchers obtained
approval from the university’s institutional review board by
submitting a written copy of the study sample and procedure
(E-19-4247).
2.3. Apparatus. Experiments were performed to study the
electroencephalography (EEG) characteristics of workers
working in the lifting tasks on diﬀerent altitudes. “All experiments were done inside the environmental chamber made in

3
(Weiss Technik UK LTD, Loughborough, UK). The environmental chamber is self-controlled of air content concerning
percent of oxygen content, dry-bulb temperature, and relative humidity inside the chamber, and presented all concerned data in a display. In addition, SENSIT® P400 MultiGas Monitor was used to gauge the ambient oxygen content
before collecting data at any session.” “An eight-channel Biomonitor ME6000, MT-ECG-1 preampliﬁer, EEG Ampliﬁer
4ch for ME6000, and Mega Win 3.0.1 software (Mega Electronics Ltd., Kuopio, Finland)” were used to record the
EEG signals. Besides, EMOTIV EEG headset was used for
holding the EEG electrodes in place, and headphones were
used to reduce the noise inside the chamber. Each used
instrument was initially calibrated and checked based on
the manufacturers’ recommendations before each testing session. Two-handle box (60 cm × 40 cm × 22 cm) was used for
lifting the loads. Also, three types of safety shoes manufactured by Shelterall Company (Italy) were used.
2.4. Experimental Design. The independent variables in this
study were ambient oxygen content, type of safety shoes,
and lifting frequency. Ambient oxygen content frequency
levels were “15%, 18%, and 21%”; the types of safety shoes
were “light, medium, and heavy” while lifting frequency
levels were 1 and 4 lifts/minute. The EEG indicators were
dependent variables, as shown in Figure 1. Two replication
analyses were conducted. EEG signals were recorded from
the right side of the head at F4, in which the frontal cortex
is in charge of executive functions, and C4, in which the central cortex is in charge of for the control of voluntary motor
movement. Ground and reference electrodes were placed
on the forehead and over the mastoid region (behind the
right ear) of the participant, respectively. The placed electrodes were following the international 10–20 systems
(Andreassi, 1995). “A signiﬁcance level was set to 0.05, and
factors such as ambient oxygen content or safety shoe type
identiﬁed as having a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the dependent variables were further analyzed using Post-hoc tests to identify
what levels of the factor are diﬀerent in their eﬀect on the
dependent variables. In addition, if an interaction was found
to have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the dependent variables, a simple eﬀect technique was conducted to demonstrate the eﬀect
at each level of one of the independent factor” [45].
2.5. Experiments Procedures. Training and acclimatization
sessions were performed for 14 days (2 hours per day) before
the experiment. “It was done to familiarize the participants
with the conditions of the experiment. Training is necessary
to develop participant’s muscles and lifting capabilities and
to become more representative of workers in the industrial
environment and also that training reduces the impact of
learning eﬀect later when conducting the experimental lifting
phase. When the participants were ready and acclimatized to
the new environment, the procedure for data collection
began. Each participant was asked to lift the weight from
knuckle to shoulder. Each participant did the lifting under
each of the 18 experimental conditions in 18 days (one
experimental condition a day), because there are three independent variables, i.e., oxygen content environments (“21%,

18%, and 15%”) (These are equivalent to attitude 0, 1500 and
2760 meters above sea level, and these altitudes represent
low, moderate and high altitude, respectively [46].” These
procedures were carried out for nearly 98% of the world’s
population lives at 2,500 meters or less [47], lifting frequency
(“1 and 4 lift/min”) [48], and safety shoes (“light-duty,
medium-duty and heavy-duty; and each one was in diﬀerent
size so that each participant wore the size that suits his foot.”
The deﬁnition of the shoe type comes from manufacturing.
For more details about the safety shoe type, please see study
[23]), where Table 1 shows the speciﬁcations for diﬀerent
types of safety shoes and Table 2 shows the 18 experimental
conditions and those done randomly.
Prior to conducting the lifting task, each participant was
equipped with placed EEG electrodes on the head. Then,
ﬁve-minute EEG signal artifacts were recorded (artifacts
include resting with a closed eye, eye blinking, chewing, body
motion [arm, leg, and head movements], and physical task
[lifting]). These signals were used during data analysis to
remove artifacts from the EEG signals; after which, each participant performed the lifting task within the chamber under
every 18 conditions of the experiment. The lifting was performed from knuckle to shoulder in the sagittal plane with
no twisting using the freestyle method, and the horizontal
distance was closed to the participant’s body as possible. Participants lifted a two-handle box (40 cm × 60 cm × 22 cm)
having the weights inside the enclosed box. After lifting the
box to the shoulder level, assistance was provided for bringing the box back to the knuckle level.
Every participant was allowed ﬁve minutes as a rest
prework and then followed by ﬁfteen minutes of lifting psychophysically to determine his MAWL [49]. (“In the psychophysical approach, a person adjusts the load such that
repetitive lifting does not result in overexertion or excessive
fatigue. The weight selected by the subject is referred to as
the MAWL”). After aﬃrmation of the participant MAWL

for the experimental session, the participants continued to lift
by this MAWL for ﬁve minutes. Next, in these ﬁve minutes of
experimental lifting, the participant is allowed ten minutes to
take rest and recover (within the chamber) followed by a second replication of lifting for another twenty minutes similar
to the ﬁrst replication (ﬁfteen minutes of lifting psychophysically to determine his MAWL. After aﬃrmation of the
participant MAWL for the experimental session, the participants continued to lift by this MAWL for ﬁve minutes).
Afterward, in the second replication, the participant was provided ﬁve minutes rest to recover inside the chamber.
Figure 2 shows the experiment’s procedures after acclimatization. The diﬀerence between the two replications was in
their starting weights. Such as for one replication, it started
with 30% of 1RM (where 1RM is the maximum amount of
weight that a person can possibly lift for one repetition),
while in the other, it started from no weight, which was randomly done for every session. During the ﬁve minutes of the
two replications for lifting using the maximum acceptable
weight of the lift, the EEG signals were measured and
recorded. Figure 3 shows the participant at rest and at work.

3. Data Analysis
3.1. Data Acquisition. The electroencephalography EEG
measuring device was an “eight-channel Biomonitor
ME6000, MT-ECG-1 preampliﬁer, EEG Ampliﬁer 4ch for
ME6000, and Mega Win 3.0.1 software (Mega Electronics
Ltd., Kuopio, Finland) at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz.”
“Matlab 2015b and Statistical Package for Social Sciences
(SPSS) Version 22” were used to preprocess and analyze
the data.
3.2. Preprocessing. The EEG raw data were contaminated
with noise, which was removed through a preprocessing procedure. Independent components analysis (ICA) was used to

remove nonstationary high-variance signals from the
recorded raw EEG signals and to rebuild the missing data
with a spatial mixing matrix. This algorithm uses a 5minute recording of EEG during resting with a closed eye,
chewing, body motion (arm, leg, and head movements), eye
blinking, and physical task (lifting). A preprocessing on the
EEG signal was carried out to remove undesired signals
(noise). Subsequently, a low-pass four-pole elliptic ﬁlter with
a cutoﬀ frequency of 50 Hz was used to remove the power
line noise and any high-frequency noises.
3.3. Data Reorganization. The preprocessed data were
divided into δ band 0-4 Hz, θ band 4-8 Hz, α band 8-13 Hz,
β band 13-30 Hz, and γ band 30-50 Hz. The δ band 0-4 Hz

was not involved in this study, because it occurs in a deep
sleep case and commonly overlaps with artifacts.
3.4. Indices. The EEG indices were classiﬁed into two clusters:
the relative index and the ratio index, which were obtained
from the reorganized data. The relative index, i.e., relative
α, is calculated as
Relative power α =

α
:
α+θ+β+γ

ð1Þ

Since the basic indices have a tendency to “contradict
each other,” the ratio indices were calculated to amplify
the diﬀerence [9]. The ratio indices that used in this study
were β/α, θ/α, (θ + α)/β [22, 50, 51], (θ + α)/(α + β), θ/β,
and α/β [22].
3.5. Analysis. The data were processed using “Matlab 2015b,
while the collected data were analyzed using IBM SPSS
version 22.0 (IBM). A four-way repeated measures design
with four independent variables was used. Therefore, the
experiment had 36 conditions upon combinations of levels
of the independent variables. The least signiﬁcant diﬀerence
method was used for pairwise comparisons of the main
eﬀects to identify signiﬁcantly diﬀerent levels of the main
variables. In addition, if an interaction had a signiﬁcant eﬀect
on the dependent variables, a simple eﬀect technique was
conducted to demonstrate the eﬀect at each safety shoe type
and ambient oxygen content factors [45]. The Shapiro–Wilk
test was implemented to test data normality [52]. The statistical signiﬁcance was set at a conﬁdence level of 95%”.

4. Results
4.1. The Basic Indices
4.1.1. Relative Alpha Power α. The results showed that the
lifting frequency had a signiﬁcant eﬀect only on the alpha
power at the central cortex, Fð1, 9Þ = 5:172, p < 0:049. The
alpha power at lifting frequency of 1 lift/min was signiﬁcantly
higher (mean, SD = 0:251, 0:1) than at lifting frequency of
4lift/min (mean, SD = 0:223, 0:058). However, the independent variables did not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on alpha power
at the frontal cortex.

4.1.2. Relative Theta Power θ. The main variable safety shoes
type and three-way interaction between ambient oxygen content, lifting frequency, and replication had signiﬁcant eﬀect
on the theta power at the frontal cortex (Fð2, 8Þ = 16:605,
p < 0:001, Fð2, 8Þ = 5:073, p < 0:038, respectively) and at
central cortex (Fð2, 8Þ = 11:57, p < 0:004, Fð2, 8Þ = 4:601,
p < 0:047, respectively). At frontal and central cortexes, the
theta power at heavy safety shoes was signiﬁcantly higher than
at light and medium safety shoes (Figure 4). However, there is
no signiﬁcant eﬀect between light and medium safety shoes.
In addition, the simple eﬀect technique was used to analyze ambient oxygen content by lifting frequency by replication interaction (Figure 5). The results showed that at the
ﬁrst replication, the theta power of the frontal and central
cortex was signiﬁcantly lower while doing 4 lifts/min and
ambient oxygen content 15% when compared with ambient
oxygen content 18% or 21% (Figure 5).
Finally, the simple eﬀect technique was used to analyze
ambient oxygen content by lifting frequency by replication
interaction (Figure 6). The results showed that at the second
replication, the theta power of the frontal cortex was signiﬁcantly lower while doing four lifts/min and ambient oxygen

content 15% than when ambient oxygen content 21%. However, the theta power of the central cortex was signiﬁcantly
lower while lifting frequency 4 lifts/min and ambient oxygen
content 18% than when ambient oxygen content 21%
(Figure 6).
4.1.3. Relative Beta Power β. The main variable safety shoes
type only had signiﬁcant eﬀect on the beta power at the frontal cortex (Fð2, 8Þ = 4:817, p < 0:042) and at central cortex
(Fð2, 8Þ = 6:397, p < 0:022). At frontal and central cortexes,
the beta power at heavy safety shoes was signiﬁcantly lower
than at light safety shoes (Figure 7). However, there is no signiﬁcant eﬀect between light and medium safety shoes or
between heavy and medium safety shoes.
4.1.4. Relative Gamma Power γ. The replication only had signiﬁcant eﬀect on the gamma power at frontal and central cortex, Fð1, 9Þ = 11:492, p < 0:008; Fð1, 9Þ = 35:332, p < 0:0001,
respectively). At frontal and central cortexes, the gamma
power at ﬁrst replication was signiﬁcantly lower than at second replication (Figure 8).

4.2.1. Theta/Alpha. The results show that in the central cortex, just the safety shoe type causes a signiﬁcant eﬀect on
the theta/alpha (Fð2, 8Þ = 4:824, p < 0:042). However, in the
frontal cortex, the safety shoes type and two-way interaction
between safety shoes type and replication had signiﬁcant
eﬀect on the theta/alpha (Fð2, 8Þ = 4:545, p < 0:048) and
(Fð2, 8Þ = 4:816, p < 0:042), respectively.
The simple eﬀect technique was used to analyze safety
shoe type by replication interaction (Figure 9). The results
showed that at the frontal cortex, the theta/alpha was significantly lower while wearing heavy safety shoes than light
safety shoes at ﬁrst replication, and the theta/alpha was signiﬁcantly lower while wearing heavy safety shoes than light
or medium safety shoes at second replication (Figure 9).

4.2.2. Theta/Beta. The factor that has signiﬁcant eﬀect on theta/beta at central cortex was frequency lifting only Fð1, 9Þ =
5:459, p < 0:044. The theta/beta was signiﬁcantly less when
lifting frequency was 4 lifts/min (mean ½SD = 0:88 ½0:35)
when compared to 1 lift/min (mean ½SD = 1:189 ½0:79).
Furthermore, three-way interaction between ambient oxygen

quency, safety shoes type, and replication had signiﬁcant
eﬀect on the theta/beta at frontal cortex, Fð4, 6Þ = 4:83, p <
0:0445, and Fð4, 6Þ = 6:83, p < 0:02, respectively.

Generally, the simple eﬀect technique was used to analyze
ambient oxygen content by safety shoe type by replication
interaction. The results show that at ambient oxygen content
15%, the theta/beta was signiﬁcantly lower at the second
replication while wearing the light safety shoes than while
wearing the medium safety shoes, as shown in Figures 10(a)
and 10(b) shows that at ambient oxygen content 18%, the
theta/beta was signiﬁcantly lower at ﬁrst replication when
wearing the medium safety shoes than when wearing the
heavy safety shoes.
4.2.3. Alpha/Beta. In the central cortex, the results show that
the safety shoe type had a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the alpha/beta
(Fð2, 8Þ = 4:613, p < 0:047), where the alpha/beta at heavy
safety shoes was signiﬁcantly higher than at medium safety
shoes. However, there is no signiﬁcant eﬀect between light
and medium safety shoes or between light and heavy safety
shoes. In additional, at frontal cortex, the safety shoes type
and three-way interaction between safety shoes type, lifting
frequency, and replication had signiﬁcant eﬀect on the
alpha/beta Fð4, 6Þ = 4:83, p < 0:044 5 and Fð4, 6Þ = 6:83,
p < 0:02, respectively, where the alpha/beta at heavy safety
shoes was signiﬁcantly higher than at light or medium safety
shoes. However, there is no signiﬁcant eﬀect between light
and medium safety shoes.
Furthermore, as shown in Figure 11(a), at the ﬁrst replication, the alpha/beta was signiﬁcantly higher while
doing 4 lifts/min and wearing the heavy safety shoes than
when wearing the light or medium safety shoes. Finally, at
the second replication, the alpha/beta was signiﬁcantly
higher while doing 4 lifts/min and wearing the heavy
safety shoes than when wearing the light or medium safety
shoes (Figure 11(b)).
4.2.4. Beta/Alpha. The safety shoes type only had signiﬁcant
eﬀect on the beta/alpha at frontal and central cortexes
(Fð2, 8Þ = 5:869, p < 0:027) and (Fð2, 8Þ = 10:428, p < 0:006),
respectively. However, there is no signiﬁcant eﬀect between
the types of safety shoes in the frontal and central cortex
although the means of beta/alpha in the frontal cortex were
1.219, 1.064, and 0.959 and in the central cortex were 1.172,
1.054, and 0.904 while wearing the light, medium, and heavy
safety shoes, respectively.
4.2.5. (Theta + Alpha)/Beta. The lifting frequency only had
signiﬁcant eﬀect (theta + alpha)/beta at the central cortex,
Fð1, 9Þ = 6:726, p < 0:029. The (theta + alpha)/beta at lifting frequency of 4 lifts/min was signiﬁcantly lower (mean,
SD = 2:23, 0:49) than at lifting frequency of 1 lift/min
(mean, SD = 2:79, 1:05). However, there is no any factor
eﬀecting on (theta + alpha)/beta at frontal cortex.
4.2.6. (Theta + Alpha)/(Alpha + Beta). The results show
that there is no any variable had signiﬁcant eﬀect on
(theta + alpha)/(alpha + beta) at frontal cortex. But vice
versa at central cortex, the two main variables ambient
oxygen content and lifting frequency had signiﬁcant eﬀect
on (theta + alpha)/(alpha + beta), Fð1, 9Þ = 6:582, p < 0:020
and Fð1, 9Þ = 5:207, p < 0:048, respectively. The (theta +
alpha)/(alpha + beta) for participants at lifting frequency

9
of 4 lifts/min was signiﬁcantly lower than the (theta +
alpha)/(alpha + beta) at 1 lift/min. Also, the (theta + alpha)/
(alpha + beta) for participants at ambient oxygen content
of 15% was signiﬁcantly lower than the (theta + alpha)/
(alpha + beta) at either ambient oxygen content of 18% or
ambient oxygen content of 21%.

5. Discussion and Conclusion
This research studied the EEG activity in diﬀerent frequency
bands, classiﬁed into two clusters: the relative indices (alpha,
theta, beta, and gamma) and the ratio indices (θ/α, θ/β, α/β,
β/α, [θ + α]/β, and [θ + α]/[α + β]), at diﬀerent brain cortex
to evaluate the eﬃciency of these indices as methods to detection of fatigue. The results of the experiments for relative
indices presented signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the lifting
frequencies at central cortex for alpha, safety shoes types,
and interaction between ambient oxygen content, frequency,
and replication at frontal and central cortexes for theta, safety
shoes types at frontal and central cortexes for beta, and replications at frontal and central cortexes for gamma. These
results are similar to the previous studies results which conclude that decreased in the power of the numerous bands of
EEG at central and frontal cortexes related to increase the
workload [53–55].
The experiment showed that EEG power of theta
decreased as the ambient oxygen content decreased at frontal
and central cortex. This ﬁnding is consistent with other
researches that reported decreased of the alpha activities is
one of the most features of cerebral hypoxia [54]. Accordingly, some researchers also found an increasing alpha activity during fatigue [6, 56]; on the contrary, the alpha, beta, and
gamma increased as the ambient oxygen content decreased at
frontal and central cortex, but these decreases and increases
in the brain signal were not signiﬁcant because participants
were subject to acclimatization sessions for 14 days. Furthermore, hypoxia leads to excessive ventilation and thus to
hypocapnia of arteriolar. This situation may account to
regional cerebral hypocapnic vasoconstriction, with changes
in lethargy, the ﬂow of cerebral blood, and synchronization
of EEG [57]. Belyavin and Wright [58] reported an increase
in theta and delta activities at fatigue; other studies reported
an increase of theta at fatigue [9]. Lal and Craig [59] also
showed a signiﬁcant increase in theta and delta activity; however, the activity of beta and alpha at fatigue showed a smaller
increase. Nevertheless, Eoh, Chung, and Kim [9] reported
that the increase in activity of alpha is the most sensitive indicator of fatigue.
The experiment results in the present study for ratio indices reveals signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the safety shoe
types at central cortex for theta/alpha, as well as safety shoe
type and two-interaction between safety shoes types and replications at frontal cortex for theta/alpha, also frequencies at
central cortex for theta/beta and three-interaction between
ambient oxygen content, safety shoes, and replication and
four-interaction between ambient oxygen content, lifting
frequency, safety shoes, and replication at frontal cortex for
theta/beta. Moreover for theta/beta, the ﬁnding showed signiﬁcant diﬀerences between safety shoes at central cortex

and safety shoes and three-interaction between frequency,
safety shoes, and replication at the frontal cortex. Also, there
were signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the type of shoes at
frontal and central cortexes for beta/alpha, as well as between
frequencies at central cortex for (theta + alpha)/beta. Finally,
ambient oxygen content and lifting frequency had signiﬁcant diﬀerences on (theta + alpha)/(alpha + beta) at the
central cortex.
Hence, a combination of several indices in detecting
fatigue might be required to enclose the reliability of the
method that can be used for the detection of fatigue. Therefore, take into consideration that safety shoes can be a
stress-adding variable, which might add to the acceleration
of the fatigue state transition and where no fatiguing conditions are present. The study acknowledges the fatigue
markers recorded in the physiological responses. The ﬁndings also suggest that the EEG monitoring should also follow
some reforms in the regulation such criteria for the selection
of the shoes, the type of shoe as per the service nature to
ensure adequate protection. Accordingly, periodic breaks
between the works should also be ensured to optimize the
performance of individuals and lower the detrimental impact
that can occur. And the applications of these tasks can occur
in almost all working environments (factories, warehouses,
airports, building sites, farms, hospitals, oﬃces, etc.) that
are at high altitudes. It can include lifting boxes at a packaging line, handling construction materials, handling patients
in hospitals, and cleaning.
