Abstract: Hot and cold thermal environments interfere with the body's thermoregulatory system, which
reacts to ensure thermal balance. The response to changes at room temperature occurs through a
process of physiological adjustment to the new environmental conditions. This process plays a key role
in human health risks prevention. This article aims to present some of the MeFinSA (Mental Fatigue in
Sedentary Activity) project results related to changes in skin temperature, in a process of acclimation to
different temperatures at the same relative humidity, in a sedentary activity. For this purpose, tests
were performed in a climatic chamber with eight male volunteers.
The tests lasted one hour a day and were repeated by each volunteer during eight days, for each of
two temperature conditions (20ºC and 32ºC) with a relative humidity of 60%. It has been found that
there is a greater homogeneity in the temperature of the skin in warmer environments (32°C) when
compared with colder environments (20°C). These results are consistent with those obtained by other
researchers.
Keywords: Acclimatization, acclimation, hot, skin temperature, thermal environment.

Skin temperature evolution in an acclimation process

Thermal environment is the set of variables that influence thermal heat exchange
between the environment and the human body, so it is a factor that, directly or indirectly,
acts on health, wellness and performing tasks. In thermal environment characterization two
situations should be considered: one is thermal "stress" (cold or heat) and the other is
thermal comfort. The first case is related to human body exposure to environments with
extremes in temperature and humidity. The second is associated to values of temperature,
humidity and air velocity that may cause discomfort.
All human activity is influenced by the environment where it is performed. In other
words, in an economic perspective, it allows productivity control; in a sociocultural context,
it reflects society customs and traditions; in a legal and political background it is expressed
by the basic needs and, in a technological context, it can represent technological progress.
Over time, the organizations have progressively been giving more importance to the
relationship between thermal environment, health problems and productivity. Productivity
is conditioned by the comfort / discomfort level perceived by the affected individual. Some
combinations of heat and humidity can be a health hazard. In fact it became increasingly
clear that there are temperatures for which the work can become dangerous. According to
several authors (Ribeiro, 2010; Radakovic et al., 2007), excessive heat exposure is related
to heat stress that is injurious to health. The thermal environmental out of the comfort zone
can affect the welfare, performance and individual`s health (Costa, Baptista & Diogo,
2012). The negative effect caused by high temperature is evidenced by changes in
behaviour, mood, fatigue, motivation, reaction speed, increased absenteeism and stress.
The study of the respective impact in the workplace has been undergoing an increasing
importance. The growing complexity of work activities, associated with different
environmental conditions, can lead to thermal stress situations. The influence of stress on
human behavior due to extreme temperatures has been studied for several years, allowing
the understanding of individual reactions in adverse working conditions. It is therefore
essential to identify and monitor variables, in order to evaluate the performance under
different environmental conditions. One of the most efficient ways human beings have to
deal with stress by exposure to heat or cold, is by physiological adaptation. This process is
known as acclimatization.
1.1. Acclimatization and Acclimation
Acclimatization and acclimation have the same goals and occur as consequence of
cold exposure or heat exposure. They happen in different contexts: the acclimatization
occurs in natural environment, while acclimation happens in a controlled environment
(Ribeiro, 2010). Acclimatization impact in a workplace is a key subject to understand
workers behaviour in different activities. In studies on thermal environment influence, a
factor that needs to be controlled is the acclimatization state, due to the fact that the
physiological response has transient characteristics during the adaptation time.
The acclimatization and its consequences were initially investigated by several
authors as Oleson and Fanger (1973) and Parsons (2003). One of the more easily
measured parameters in the acclimatization process is skin temperature. Skin temperature
is influenced by thermal exchanges by conduction, convection, radiation and evaporation
on the skin surface and, in addition, undergoes the influence of changes in skin blood flow

1. Introduction

1.2 Skin Temperature

Skin temperature evolution in an acclimation process

Skin temperature is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system activity. Even
when the entire skin surface is exposed to a constant ambient temperature, skin
temperature is different on the different body areas. According to (Schlader et al., 2013)
skin temperature plays an important signaling role in human thermoregulatory behavior.
The skin is the largest human body organ, and acts as the boundary between the
body and the external environment. The skin controls the flow of heat and moisture with
the surrounding environment, protects the body from the sun's rays and helps to keep a
constant internal body temperature (≈37°C). Skin temperature also depends on climatic
factors such as humidity, air temperature, wind chill, and exposure time to a particular
environment. Skin temperature also changes over its own surface, especially in cold
environmental conditions, in which the normal average skin temperature (tskm) is about
33°C (91F) which can be referred to as its "set point" (Arens, 2006).
1.3 Objectives
This paper aims to present the first results of the project MeFinSA (Mental Fatigue in
Sedentary Activity) relating to changes in skin temperature acclimation process.

2. Methodology
The tests were performed within a climatic chamber, where a sedentary activity is
simulated supposedly provoking mental fatigue. Eight healthy volunteers participated in all
the trials, aged between twenty and twenty seven years old who were asked to avoid
coffee, alcohol, smoking and physical activity at least twelve hours prior to each test.
Preliminary tests were carried on to test all the equipment and the reproducibility of trials.
After that, all assays in the acclimation process were performed at the same time in the
afternoon; this option aimed at minimizing the effects of circadian rhythms. All subjects had
no significant disease. The protocol (with number nº04/CEUP/2012) was approved by the

18

and arterial blood temperatures. The skin being directly in contact with the external
environmental conditions and being the more accessible part of the human body, it was
hypothesized that it could provide one or more points that allow an expeditious measure of
individual’s acclimatization state.
Heat acclimatization improves tolerance to higher and lower temperatures and it is
more effective when implemented in warm and humid conditions. In this case, a successful
indicator is the decrease of the core temperature (tc). Furthermore, cold acclimatization
can minimize the risks of cold related injuries. Sawka et al. (2001) refer that human
adaptation to heat or cold exposure tends to stabilize core and skin temperature, reducing
physiological strain, improving work capabilities and consequently reducing the
susceptibility to thermal injuries.
Children and adults have similar physiological adaptations during acclimatization to
heat. These adaptations involve a lower heart rate, lower core and skin temperatures and
a reduction of electrolytes loss in sweat (Naughton, 2008). Nevertheless, the
acclimatization to heat may take a different course depending on the environment being
dry or humid (Sawka, 2001; Naughton, 2008; Nielson et al., 1993).

2.1 Equipment

Skin temperature evolution in an acclimation process

For this study, the main equipment was the climate chamber within which all tests
occurred. In Figure.1, all the equipment and instruments used can be observed (Costa &
Baptista 2013).
2.2 Protocol
The assays were performed according to a protocol involving the following steps:
first, the laboratory is shown and the research team is presented to the volunteer to whom
the tests are explained (the volunteer does not do any test on the first day in lab). First, the
volunteer is introduced to the research team who then lead him into the laboratory where
all the tests to go through are explained in detail (on this first day no tests will take place).
Since the climatic chamber can take few hours to reach some of the intended "set points",
for precaution, all tests are scheduled and prepared in advance. The first day of testing
begins with 1) Questioning the volunteer on any doubts related with the test; 2) Reading
and signing the informed consent, if the volunteer is going through this experience for the
first time 3) Registration by the researcher in the individual test sheet (FIE n.1) of the
temperature and humidity in the laboratory and inside the chamber, while the volunteer
reads the Informed consent and / or is preparing himself for the test; 4) Register in FIE n.1
the weight of the volunteer.

Ethics Committee of the University of Porto. An informed consent was read and signed by
each volunteer before its participation in the study. The subjects were fully informed of any
risk and discomfort associated with the experiment. Prior to each test, the volunteers body
mass (kg) and height (centimeters) were determined.
Each acclimation test lasted for one hour during which the subjects performed a set
of four tests. The criteria to stop an assay was any of the following situations: a) finishing
the four cognitive given tasks, b) feeling any symptoms such as dizziness, nausea and
general malaise c) reaching 38.5 °C of internal temperature, measured by an ingestible
thermometer Equivital System, d) reaching 165 bpm (beats per minute) of heart rate
(measured with electrodes GE - Healthcare), e) feeling any other symptoms of heat stress,
or if the volunteer, for any reason, decides to stop the task.
The skin temperature was recorded at 14 points according to ISO (9886:2004)
standard. Assays were performed in two environment temperatures: 20 °C and 32 °C both
with an air humidity of 60% Hr. A sedentary activity in a duly tested climatic chamber
(Guedes et al., 2012) was simulated and appropriate parameters and equipment were
selected according to (Costa & Baptista, 2013), as well as the procedure for measuring the
internal temperature of the body (Costa et al., 2012a). In this situation, in addition to skin
temperature (ISO 9886, 2004), other parameters were monitored, such as: intra-abdominal
temperature via ingestible temperature sensors (TIS); brain activity through
electroencephalography (EEG); electrodermal activity through (EDA), muscle activity
through electromyography (EMG) and heart rate through electrocardiography (ECG).
Furthermore, two questionnaires of subjective evaluation were also used, one for
evaluation of thermal sensation, and another to evaluate workload NASA TLX (Hart &
Staveland, 1988).

2.3 Skin temperature measurement
The skin temperature was monitored at 14 points all over the body as shown in
Table 1. This monitoring was conducted in accordance with ISO9886 standard
(International standard – Ergonomics Evaluation of Thermal Strain by Physiological
Measurements) and some other studies (Ely et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2008; Costa &
Baptista, 2013).

The skin temperature was measured with “Plux temperature sensors” colleted by the
system bioPLUXresearch. These sensors were designed for applications involving
continuous or intermittent temperature readings. This NTC (negative temperature
coefficient) thermistor has been developed for biomedical applications with the possibility
of being used in a temperature range from 0ºC to 50°C. The Plux temperature sensors are

 The test should take about one hour, starting with a random sequenced battery of
cognitive tests;
 Fulfill the thermal sensation questionnaire at the end of the test, after finishing the
last test battery;
 Remove the blood pressure meter;
 Disconnect and remove the electroencephalogram (EEG) from the volunteer head;
 After removing the equipment (EEG) the volunteer leaves the chamber;
 After leaving the climatic chamber, the volunteer puts on a robe and waits at least
10 minutes out of the chamber until his blood pressure is stabilized.
 Remove the remaining sensors placed on the skin in the following order: a) SEM
equivital (if applicable); b) ECG; c) Temperature sensors TempPlux; d)
Electrodermal activity Sensors (EDA); e) EMG sensors.
Subsequently, the following steps are carried on: reweight the volunteer and record
the value in (FIEn.1); collect the test battery; check if the data were stored according to the
following checklist: a) Camera; b) BioPLUX number 29; c) BioPLUX number 37; d) ECG;
e) Equivital; f) EEG; g) Blood pressure meter; h) Battery Tests; i) Thermal sensation
questionnaire; j) NASA TLX questionnaire; k) Anthropometric data. Finally, the data are
saved according to the specific protocol.

2.4 Core temperature measurement.
As already mentioned body temperature is a physiological parameter that changes
according to the measurement point location and environmental temperature. It can be
measured internally, and in this case, corresponds to “core temperature", t c, or it can be
measured more superficially (skin; axillary, tympanic, oral). In this last procedure, it is more
influenced by room temperature, and is also less reproducible than core temperature
(Ribeiro, 2010). In the present work, tc was measured using an ingestible temperature
sensor, Vital Sense. After a careful analysis, the use of ITS (Ingestible Thermal Sensors)
(Costa et al, 2012), having less technical limitations and being less invasive, was chosen
as the best option to measure tc in the occupational environment.
2.5 EEG
Heat exposure may change cognitive performance. An excessive mental load
combined with high temperature and humidity can lead rapidly to a state of fatigue.
Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to study this parameter (Costa et al 2013) and to
record electrical activity along the scalp. Recent technological advances allow real-time
online processing of multi-channel EEG data using EEG devices (e.g., Emotiv EPOC EEG
headset) (Bobrov et al., 2011).

Skin temperature evolution in an acclimation process

2.6 Battery of cognitive tasks
A battery of psychological tests implemented in PEBL (Psychology Experiment Building
Language) and distributed freely was used. These tests are used in psychological,
neuropsychological research and clinical communities. The cognitive tests were: SRT –
Simple Reaction Time - to detect the presence of a visual stimulus as quickly and
accurately as possible; DSpan – Digit Span: to remember a sequence of digits; Satest –
Situation Awareness Test: to watch a set of moving targets which respond to probes about
their locations and identities; GoNoGo_Classic: for continuous performance of a task. All
tasks were carried on with computer support. The test battery took approximately 60 min to
perform (Costa et al., 2013).

3. Results Presentation
The evolution of skin temperature in an acclimation process and the data related to
skin temperature of two individuals over eight days are presented. The tests were
conducted to assess acclimation analyzing the evolution of physiological response. The
tests were performed in two different conditions: 20ºC-60% Hr (considered fresh), and
32ºC-60% Hr (considered hot).
Table 2, lists the environmental variables related to the days of the tests and the
anthropometric data of volunteers.
Five different analysis are emphasized in this study: 1) temperature changes over
one hour test, which analyzes the initial and the final temperature for each day; 2) variation

also provided an increased confidence on obtained results.

3.1. Variation in skin mean temperature over one hour test
During the tests, it was found a different acclimation pattern between the hot (32°C)
and cold environment (20ºC). In hot environment, there was a decrease of approximately
1°C in mean skin temperature (tskm) in the beginning of the test between the first day
(around 35ºC) and the eighth day of acclimation (around 34ºC). During the test, the
temperature tends to reach the value prior to acclimation (Figure 2), an effect which was
not so evident on the first day.

Skin temperature evolution in an acclimation process

When the analysis is performed separately for each one of the fourteen points of skin
temperature measurement, it is observed that each one has a characteristic development
that differs when environments are hot or cold.
In the search for a point of easy access and high reliability where the occurrence of
acclimation could be verified, the results pointed to the head, particularly to the forehead
and neck. On these two points, for the hot environment, it seems to be the neck that offers
more reliability (Figure 4). For the cold environment, the forehead seems to be the most
suitable (Figure 5).
3.3. Variation in skin mean temperature over eight days of acclimation test
Figures 6 and 7, show the variation in skin temperature over the eight days of
acclimation at two different temperatures and humidity.
Figure 6, displays instability on the average of skin temperature, showing variations in
different days. The difference between the maximum and minimum tskm at 20ºC-60% Hr
over 8 days of acclimation is 1.28ºC.
In Figure 7, it can be seen greater stability of mean skin temperature in warm
temperatures. Significant differences during the trial are not verified. The difference
between the maximum and the minimum tskm value, at 32ºC-60% Hr over 8 days of
acclimation was 0.41ºC.

24

Emília Quelhas Costa, João Santos Baptista, Jorge Carvalho

The opposite situation happened in the cold environment (Figure 3). In this case, the
acclimation caused a rise in skin mean temperature by about 1°C verified at the beginning
of the test. It was observed an adaptation to the new environment temperature over an
hour. In the course of the test, this difference gradually fades, resuming the skin preacclimation values.
Throughout the trials, tskm evolved to the values previous to acclimation. This
phenomenon occurred in either hot or cold environment but not in an identical manner.
In the tests performed, it was observed that there was a need for more time for
acclimation to cold environments than to warm ones.

Skin temperature evolution in an acclimation process

Analyzing these two situations, it is found that when in cold temperatures (Figure 5),
the variability of tskm is generically greater than when they are hot (Figure 4).

3.4 Variation in the mean temperature of the neck and forehead over 8 days.
In Figure 8, it can be seen the maximum and minimum temperature of the forehead
for 32ºC and 20ºC. The same occurrence is visible in Figure 9, concerning the neck
temperature.
The difference between the maximum and minimum mean forehead temperature at
32ºC is 0.64ºC while at 20ºC 60% Hr is 3.90ºC. Once again, a biger difference in cold
condition was registered.
The difference between the maximum and minimum temperature in the neck mean
temperature at 32ºC 60% Hr is 0.37ºC, while at 20ºC, 60% Hr is 5.18ºC. It also appears
that there is less difference between the temperature of the forehead and neck in the case
of hot environments and a greater difference between these temperatures in cold ones.

Analyzing these two situations (Figure 8 and 9) it was once again verified a great
difference between the maximum and minimum temperature in a cold environment.
Between the neck and the forehead it was found that in hot conditions the temperature of
the neck is slightly higher than the forehead temperature, and the difference between the
maximum and minimum is smaller.

3.5. Comparison of variation of skin temperature on each part of the body
As it can be seen in Figures 10 and 11, there is a greater homogeneity in hot
temperature than in cold temperature in all parts of the body where the measurements
were performed.

4. Discussion of the results
4.1 Physiologic response to heat and cold environments
It is already known that the skin mean temperature (tskm) has a good correlation with
the feeling of comfort. However, there is still some concern about the correlation between
the average temperature and other indexes. In order to verify to what extent the
temperature of the skin is an effective indicator to assess the influence of thermal
environment in sedentary activity, some points were found that can lead to the following
information.
To describe the physiological response to heat and cold environments, the body is
considered divided into two components: core and shell. The surface temperature is
represented by the mean temperature of the skin, and core temperature is represented by
the internal temperature. When the body is faced with challenges to neutrality (eg when in
a state of hot or cold stress), strives to regain the thermal equilibrium through physiological
adjustments. The two forms of physiological adjustments to different thermal environments
are sweating and shivering.
In fact, the human body reacts to lower temperatures, mainly by constriction of
peripheral blood vessels, and to high temperatures mainly by increasing the secretion of
sweat. It is known that the physical regulation by constriction or dilation of blood vessels is
essentially a change of heat conductivity between room temperature and internal body
temperature and that the different body segments play different roles concerning heat
removal.

Skin temperature evolution in an acclimation process

4.2. The importance of acclimation
Heat acclimation is likely to confer an important advantage that is a decrease in core
body temperature in the order of 0.3 - 0.5°C (Buono et al, 1989). The effects of acclimation
were also studied by Radakovic (2007) on cognitive and physiological performance against
heat stress in soldiers, when carrying out stress tests. Those 40 male soldiers were tested
at temperatures of 20ºC (16ºC wet globe temperature), cold, and 40ºC (29ºC wet globe
temperature) before and after acclimation for 10 days. Also Lee et al (2012) refer that in a
warm and humid climate, a typical 10-day heat acclimatization program can improve work
tolerance with 20.5 kg and 24.7 kg standard military load configurations in trained soldiers.
The physiologic adjustments of heat acclimation are: internal and skin temperature
reduction, decreased heart rate and increased sweating rate. The main changes that occur
with hot acclimation are: increased blood volume, increased blood flow, increased venous
tone, increased sweating rate; earlier onset of sweating, production of more dilute sweat,
sweat with lower sodium concentration, more widespread sweating, less cardiac
frequency, lower metabolic rate, lower inner temperature, lower skin temperature, better
hydric balance, increased thirst (Sawka et al., 2001).
On the other side, when exposed to cold environments, human body will respond with
vasoconstriction to maintain core reduced heat loss from core to periphery by convection,
and heat loss from periphery to environment, by radiation and convection (Yu, Cao, Cui,
Ouyang, & Zhu, 2013).
Lower skin temperatures during cold air exposure following acclimation have two
implications: (a) at a given air temperature, lower skin temperatures reduce thermal
gradient for heat transfer between the skin and the air, which improves insulation; (b) in the
cold exposure, the magnitude of the acclimation effect on the skin temperature is greater
than the effect on core temperature. Therefore, the core-to-skin thermal gradient is higher.
A higher thermal gradient, between the core and the skin, favors redistribution of body heat
from the core to the subcutaneous muscular shell, while lower skin temperature due to
enhanced cutaneous vasoconstriction will limit heat loss through the body's shell.

the information processed by the brain (Kataoka, 1998). According to the standard
ISO_9886, skin temperature varies over body surface, and especially in cold
environmental conditions. For this reason there is a distinction between local skin
temperature (tsk) at a specific point on the surface of the body, and skin temperature over
the entire surface of the body that can be estimated by a mean value (tskm), considering a
set of local skin temperatures, according to the characterizing area. Skin temperature
alone is not sufficient to assess the physiological thermal stress, but an important criterion
for evaluating thermal comfort.
Skin temperature depends on thermal exchanges by conduction, convection,
radiation, evaporation, changes in blood flow, and arterial blood temperature which
reaches each zone of the body. The heat losses from the body are caused precisely by
variable thermal exchanges that cause temperature alterations along the body. When air
temperature is close to skin temperature, around 31-33°C, heat losses from convection
ceases and, under these conditions, the body becomes highly and almost totally
dependent on the evaporative cooling for heat dissipation (Baker 1954).
Body temperature is also subjected to a circadian rhythm variation that can be up to
about 1 °C over the day in a normal subject (Ribeiro, 2010).

5. Conclusions
It is already known that the skin mean temperature (tskm) has a good correlation with
the feeling of comfort. However, there is still some concern about the correlation between
the average temperature and other indexes. After this work/research, and in order to verify
to what extent the temperature of the skin is an effective indicator to assess the influence
of the thermal environment in sedentary activity, some points were found that can lead to
such information and one of them will be the head, particularly in the forehead and neck.
Regarding these two points, heat situations seem to be more noticeable in the neck and, in
cold environments, the forehead. Other authors suggest that there is no correlation and
direct connection between the skin temperature and performance.
The results clearly point to the existence of a differentiated acclimation when it comes
to hot and cold environments. However, these results are not in line with many others
found in the literature and in international organizations. Without discussing the results
presented by other authors, as for example Oleson and Fanger (1973), but given the rigor
placed on tests performed, it seems obvious that the process and acclimation time is
different for hot and cold environments. It is important to check the influence of the
differential between the starting temperature of acclimation and the time needed for the
body's adaptation to new environmental conditions. This knowledge is of great importance
for work world, particularly for occupations where working conditions require a good
capacity for climate adaptation. Obvious examples are sectors such as metallurgical and
glass industry, mineral underground exploitation, bakery and catering, among others. The
need for acclimation also occurs in areas where there is the/ a intercontinental movement
of workers or even for tourists.
