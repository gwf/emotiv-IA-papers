electrical signals in the brain is through rhythm information or

in amplitude between symmetric channels, and the presence

Electroencephalogram (EEG) and motor signals -imagery to
think of movements that can be obtained on EEG signals [4].
Ischemic stroke occurs because of obstruction that can make

Abstract— Stroke is a condition that occurs when the blood
supply to the brain is disrupted or reduced. It may be caused by
a blockage (ischemic stroke) or rupture of a blood vessel
(hemorrhagic stroke) so that it can cause disability. Therefore
patients need to undergo rehabilitation. One of the procedures
of monitoring of the recovery of stroke patients using the
National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) method, but
sometimes subjectively. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is an
instrument that can measure electrical activity in the brain,
including abnormalities caused by stroke. This study
investigates EEG signal detection in post-stroke patients using
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and 1D Convolutional Neural
Network (1D CNN). Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) extraction
can increase accuracy from 60% to 80.3% from the use of
Adam's optimization model. Meanwhile, the AdaDelta model
gave 20% accuracy without FFT. And its condition increased to
79.9% with FFT extraction. Therefore, Adam's stability has the
advantage of remembering to use hyper-parameter. On the
other hand, FFT is beneficial for directing information used for
the use of 1D CNN, thus increasing accuracy. The results
showed that using of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in
identification could increase accuracy by 45-80% compared to
identification using only 1D CNN. Meanwhile, the results of the
study show that the relative weight correction model using
Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) provided higher accuracy
compared to the Adaptive learning rate (AdaDelta). Although
both provide training data accuracy of 100%, the accuracy of
training data is very dependent on variations in training data.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is an instrument for
capturing electrical activity in the brain. The signal generated
from this EEG device can achieve the state of mind and
electrical abnormalities in the brain. However, the EEG signal
is non-stationary, has a small amplitude, so it is not easy in
visual observation. The EEG signal consists of wave
components based on frequencies, namely Alpha waves (8-13
Hz), Theta waves (4-7 Hz), and Delta waves (0.5-3 Hz) [6].
Therefore, extracting the EEG signal into a frequency
component becomes useful [7]. Other studies detected
epilepsy disorders using the FFT and wavelet methods [8] [9],
to the analysis of brain signal activity in ischemic stroke
patients using FFT [10].
One method of signal extraction into frequency
components is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Although
the FFT method is more appropriate for stationary signals if
segmented in a short time, the stationer signal approach for
EEG signals can be used [11].

Deep learning is part of machine learning with increased
accuracy. This method used depth computing through
convolution with the kernel and provided with more training
data. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) devices support using
Deep learning to solve obstacles in speed and memory. Some
methods that are often used in deep learning use
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNN). Both have their characteristics and
capabilities in signal processing. CNN is very often used in
image or video processing [12]. However, for signal
processing, convolution is carried out on a one-dimensional
kernel, so-called one dimension CNN. Previous studies used
the 1D CNN method to identify ischemic stroke with EEG
using 1D CNN and normalization batches [5]. The research
showed that 1D CNN method gives accurate results in the
classification process, considering convolution with many
previous layers. Also, 1D CNN was used to analyze
epileptiform spikes on EEG signals [13], then classify
emotions accurately [14][15]. EEG signal information can
predict left and right movements using CNN. [16].

I. INTRODUCTION
Stroke is a condition that occurs when the blood supply to
the brain is disrupted or reduced due to blockage (ischemic
stroke) or rupture of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke).
Without blood, the brain will not get oxygen and nutrients [1],
so cells in some areas of the brain will die such as muscle
disorders, loss of senses in the body, aphasia or impaired
speech function, and cognitive and visuospatial problems [2].
According to the research of the Indonesian Ministry of Health
in 2013, more than 15% of deaths in Indonesia were caused
by ischemic strokes. The consequences of stroke not only
caused depression, physical disability, but even ischemic
stroke can also cause death.
In healing stroke, rehabilitation is usually needed [2], to
restore the patient's abilities such as the original or no stroke
condition. So that need monitoring the patient's development
to observation brain recovery. One method that is used to
monitor and evaluate the progress of patients is the National
Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). The method to
determine the recovery level of stroke patients. NIHSS
examines 11 criteria from standard neurological examinations
that assess levels of consciousness, sensory function, hand
movements, leg movements, facial muscle function, patient's
eye, sensory censorship, given command response, language
ability, speech, and no attention [3]. One way of observing

Post-stroke patients who have undergone rehabilitation
allow the electrical disturbances in the brain to improve. To
monitor the progress of recovery, accompanied by NIHSS, the
EEG signal detection model was used. The EEG signal is
extracted first in the frequency domain, namely Alpha, Theta,

EEG signals [19], and epilepsy [20]. Also, previous researches
used 1D CNN to human biometric identification [20],
classification of motor-imagery in the Brain-Computer
Interface (BCI) field [21], predicting the accuracy of carotid
endarterectomy in stroke patients [22], and identified acute
ischemia in stroke patients [1].

and Delta wave using FFT. The EEG signal involved comes
from 14 channels. The extraction results were passed through
training using 1D CNN before detecting the "No Stroke" and
"Stroke" classes.

stages.
1) Convolution
Convolution consists of neurons arranged so that they have
the length of pixels that make up the kernel. The kernel is used
as a shift as much as the stride value to the right until the end.
The convolution stage must determine the activation value
used for the contents of the kernel. To obtain the output value
by dots product between input and result of the kernel to
produce an output called the Feature Map (FM) using (7) as
an operator.

4) Classification Layer
Next is the classification layer, which is composed of
several layers. Each layer is formed of fully connected
neurons with other layers using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).
This layer gets input from the output of the previous layer,
which is a vector feature extraction layer [23]. In one
dimension CNN, generalizations in learning use
Backpropagation to minimize errors from each output neuron
and the network as a whole by continuing to improve its
weight based on the desired difference in output and target

In the classification or identification stage, it used fully
connected layer, which all neurons to connect to the next layer
or without the Pooling process. The classification layer can
use several methods, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM)
or Backpropagation. This latter method is widely used and
uses the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) architecture. [5]. To
connect between layer usually uses ReLu activation function.

Meanwhile, the Softmax activation function is used at the
output layer to calculate the probability of each destination
class and choose the largest one using (9).

B. Segmentation
EEG recording of 50 subjects stored in a file (.csv). Then
the signal is segmented every three seconds. Each record
produced 120 seconds, so there are 40 segments. Each
segment numbering 384 points, extracted using FFT at a
frequency of 1-14 Hz. While the variable amplitude is
obtained for a maximum value every 16 seconds interval. So
that if the duration of processing an EEG signal is 120
seconds, 960 amplitude points are obtained.

C. Extraction using Fast Fourier Transform
The next step is extraction using FFT, which consists of
frame-based with 50% overlap. From (1) with a window width
of 0.5 seconds and produce a value of N = 64 and M = 32, 11
frames are obtained. The FFT extraction stage of 11 frames to
load only frequencies from 1-14 Hz produces 154 points. If
the EEG signal is processed from 14 channels, 2,156 features
are obtained. By adding 135 amplitude features, 3,116
features were obtained as input to the detection model using
1D CNN.

METHODS

EEG signals from post-stroke patients were extracted
using Fast Fourier Transform from a frequency of 1-14 Hz,
which contained Delta, Theta, and Alpha wave and amplitude
components. The extracted signal was detected using 1D
CNN, as shown in Fig. 3.

At this stage, the signal that has been extracted will then
be identified using 1D CNN through the convolution stage,
pooling, later identification using the backpropagation

is 3.116 features.
In the learning phase, what is very important is the method
for weighting, which is called the optimization model. This
study used the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) model

Although compared to the Stochastic Gradient Descent

RESULT AND DISCUSSION

The experimental results are split into four parts, namely
FFT extraction, configuration optimization, and the effect of
using FFT. In this study, data used 80% for training and 20%
validation data. The test was carried out with two models for
renewal of weights, model Adam and AdaDelta.

C. Influence of FFT as Feature Extraction
The EEG signal detection model of post-stroke patients
consists of two parts, extraction, and detection. In this section,
it is necessary to examine the effect of using FFT on detection
performance, as in Table III. It is seen that the accuracy of the
detection model using FFT is higher, which achieved 100% of
training data and 80.3% of validation data. This result higher
than using without FFT that are 58.63% of validation data.
These results indicate that FFT can help recognize EEG
signals and reduce computing time.

B. Configuration Optimization
Experiments were carried out with a 1D CNN
configuration model that provided the best accuracy. The four
configurations are based on the number of layers and filters of
the input layer where convolution continues to increase. The
setting is intended to minimize errors and revise the weight to
produce better accuracy. This model uses Adam optimization

because all the features in the direct data are identified using
1D CNN without going through the FFT extraction stage so
that it does not take the essential elements. For the loss value
on Adam, it experiences very fast convergence on the 4th
epoch, and the accuracy starts to stabilize at the 40th epoch but
fluctuated up to epoch to 100 with an accuracy of 0.538 and
for test data the loss accuracy is 0.538 which starts converging
to 10rd epoch and stable correctness to epoch to 100 which
can be seen in Fig. 11.

D. Comparing Two Models of Optimization Using FFT
Extraction
This section tests the accuracy of the two optimization
methods, particularly Adam and AdaDelta. The experiment
showed that testing using the Adam optimization model with
FFT extraction like Fig. 6, the accuracy of the training data is
100% since the 38th epoch, but accuracy has fluctuated up to
epoch to 92 after 102.7 seconds while the testing of new data
gave an accuracy of 80.30%. Losses of Adam model with
FFT, as shown in Fig. 7.

Fig. 10. Accuracy of the Adam model without FFT

Fig. 11. Loss of the Adam model without FFT
Fig. 7. Loss of the Adam model with FFT

Adadelta model without FFT extraction gave
70% accuracy of training data and 20.10% of new data
(Fig. 12). It took 301.8 seconds of the learning process.
For Adadelta's loss value from fluctuating accuracy 0.581.
Meanwhile, the loss from validation data varies to epoch
to 100, which is 0.866. There is a much higher loss
compared to Adam's optimization up to 4,78593, which can
be seen in Fig. 13.

Meanwhile, the AdaDelta model also provides enough
accuracy, which is almost the same as the performance of the
Adam model, which is 79.90%. The accuracy and Losses of
the AdaDelta model are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9

Fig. 8. Accuracy of AdaDelta model with FFT
Fig. 12. Accuracy of AdaDelta model without FFT

Fig. 9. Loss of AdaDelta model with FFT

The Adam method relatively does not take up much
memory, so the computing process more efficient and is
suitable for non-stationary data.

Fig. 13. Loss of AdaDelta model without FFT

If using FFT with Adam optimization for test data, it is
prepared with epochs up to 100, and the use of 0.001 learning
rate can improve accuracy for the better. However, if using
Adadelta optimization, there is a decrease in truth up to 0.4%.
Detection without FFT extraction gave lower accuracy, 39.90
only of same configuration and epoch. Therefore, FFT
extraction is greatly influenced accuracy both optimation
model.

Another advantage of Adam is the size of the parameter
update is not the same as the gradient scale; the shortcomings
of Adam's size are limited by hyper-parameter. Meanwhile,
AdaDelta's model does not require hyper-parameter to
improve learning on each iteration.
E. Comparing Two Models of Optimization Without FFT
Extraction
Experiments using the Adam optimization model without
FFT extraction can be seen in Fig. 10. The accuracy of training
data is convergent since the 71st epoch is 100%, and the new
data fluctuated from epoch 40-98, and the final accuracy is
60% with a length of training time of 238.2. This result is

V.

CONCLUSION

Detection of EEG signals from post-stroke patients using
Fast Fourier Transform and 1D CNN can provide the best
accuracy of 100% of training data and 80.3% of validation
data.

EEG signals from dominant post-stroke patients at low
frequencies and the ups and downs of amplitude for each time,
according to previous studies, so that extraction into frequency
components using Fast Fourier Transform can increase the
accuracy of almost 30%. 1D CNN recognizes signals to
certain variables with convolution along with sequential data
without the need for time constraints so that they can be
combined with pre-processes such as FFT to extract suitable
frequency. More suitable for use in data with a frequency
range with a significant distribution of values or with a tight
frequency range. Moreover, we investigated Adadelta having
difficulty in learning on 1D CNN without extraction with FFT
which was characterized by a continuously increasing loss
value and small accuracy and minimal change.

Adadelta has characteristics that tend to be more stable due
to the limitation of the size of the accumulated changes in the
previous weight values to a fixed value to several sizes. Also,
this causes Adadelta to be able to provide stagnant learning
both for training data and test data. Meanwhile, Adam
calculates the new weight by storing the old weight and doing
averages on the weights that produce exponential error values.
This result caused Adam to be able to move like a heavy ball
which rubs continuous while maintaining convergence and
avoids the optimum local value by making an average of
significant changes. If comparing Adam with Adadelta has
similar characteristics, but Adam can learn better by
optimizing exponential error values and empirically with
Learning Rate configuration 0.001 and Decay 0.0.
