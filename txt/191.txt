Abstract
Since the emphasis of utilizing ICT in education moves from ICT to Computing in many
countries, curriculums adapt the Computational Thinking (CT) teaching as a basic
courses not only for primary school but also to CS education. Even though the depth of
CT teaching may be different, we may expect similar impact of CT teaching results to
student problem solving skills. With this rationale, we opened designed CT based
education program for freshman introductory of computer application course. Developed
course consists of 10 class hours program and the effectiveness of designed programs
have been tested, firstly for improving CT capabilities of learners in problem solving
environment, and secondarily the cognitive load changes appeared in the problem solving
process have been measured with direct brain wave measurement of EEG while solving
problems. The test results showed that designed CT program affected to the improvement
of problem solving skill, and also show the tendency of decrease in cognitive overload in
the experimental group.

1. Introduction
With an emphasis towards transitioning from Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) in education to Computing, many countries have started to adapt
the Computational Thinking (CT) skill as a basic course for primary school as well
as higher education [1, 2].
Computing competencies have become a major skill needed to carry out logical and
procedural thinking necessary to solve complex problems in various academic and real
life situations. Similarly, the computational thinking concepts were introduced by Janet
Wing in her seminal article as „CT represents a universally applicable attitude and skill set
everyone, not just computer scientist, would be eager to learn and use‟[3]. Wing noted
that CT can be acknowledged in basic literacy terms as the 3R‟s (Read, wRite,
aRithmetic) [3].
Even though CT is popular in computer science education and introducing computers
to schools, there are few researches that address the computational practice aspect of CT
that is applicable to problem-solving environments [4]. Therefore, in this paper, we want
to show the impact of a CT based curriculum on students‟ problem solving competencies
and monitor cognitive load changes in problem solving environments in higher education
settings.
For higher education settings, students were asked to take the Scratch
programming as the common learning subject; Scratch programming with CT based

education. To measure the effectiveness of the teachings, both experimental and
control groups were administered a traditional paper-and pencil CT competencies
test. We also tried to directly measure cognitive load changes through observing
students acquiring computational concepts in a problem solving process [4] with
EEG measurement.

2. Theoretical Background
2.1. Computational Thinking (CT)
As Wing [3] mentioned, CT is defined as the thought processes involved in
formulating problems and finding the solutions to be carried out by an informationprocessing agent. Therefore, many researches stress that introducing CT in education may
be beneficial to learners in terms of developing learners' ability to think and promote the
strategies to put their knowledge to practical use [5].
CT skills not only help learners choose and utilize appropriate tools and strategies for
problems solving [2], but also can be used to establish a suitable strategy for solving the
problem. Such strategies may involve the use of suitable automated algorithms to solve
the problem utilizing a computing system. Therefore, if one has CT skills, he/she is
expected to improve their efficiency of solving problems across a variety of disciplines in
real-life settings.
Although the definition of computational thinking remains ambiguous due to its nondominant discourse reigns, CT education is effective in systematically improving the
following capabilities as shown in Table 1.

From these 9 concepts of CT skills of Table 1, we can create connections between
three domains of computational thinking of Scratch based programming [7] and Barr‟s
CT concepts as following Table 2 [8]. From both Table 1 and 2, it is clear that using
Scratch programming may improve CT skills in many aspects of CT definitions from
ISTE, CSTA, NSF [8]. This assumption is justified due to the fact that the problem
solving is usually approached using Means-Ends Analysis [9], and novices are
encouraged to focus on an initial state rather than a desired state in the Scratch
programming. Since the Scratch has the characteristics of easiness to check results even

the novice programmer does not need to consider the desired state at the initial learning
stage.

2.2. Computational Thinking and Cognitive Load
According to cognitive load theory (CLT), cognitive overload occurs when one
exceeds the required cognitive resources necessary to solve problems. Cognitive overload
is considered a major cause of learning failure. Thus, there have been many attempts to
identify the factors that cause unnecessary cognitive load and the teaching strategies to
manage the learners‟ cognitive load during study [10].
Sweller [11] researched how to promote learners‟ problem solving process by reducing
the cognitive effort of learners and obtaining a cognitive structure that is needed to
resolve the problem. It was about how learners can acquire the problem solving principle
and store it to their long-term memory.
Compared with previous instructional design approaches we are interesting the impact
of CT based education to learners; especially the decrease of cognitive load that learners‟
show after certain hours of training. For this experiment, we considered novice computer
science students to acquire CT skills for problem solving environments so that the skills
may contribute to reduce the cognitive load to solve problems.
2.3. Cognitive Load and Brain Activation
2.3.1 Brain Activation Measurement: As modern sensing technologies advance, various
types of physiological measurement techniques have been developed for assessing the
cognitive workload. Direct measurement of cognitive load in multimedia learning [12]
using fMRI or other physiological methods have been proposed. In this paper, we also
apply the EEG (Electroencephalography) technique for direct measure of cognitive load.
Brain wave comes from the summation of brain electrical activity that occurs in the
nerve cell population of cerebral cortex in vitro, and it is amplified and recorded from the
scalp phase (intact scalp). The signal is recorded as the horizontal axis showing the time
and the vertical axis to show electric potential. EEG is an objective, non-invasive,
continuous test to assess cerebral function and it is widely used today for cerebral
function evaluation.
Previous research has demonstrated that EEG signals are sensitive to cognitive load
changes in various tasks [5]. Among them, we referred Gevins and Smith [13] report that
spectral features of the theta and alpha frequency bands correlate with task difficulty

levels. Also, Fitzgibbon and his colleagues [14] showed that the power of gamma band
could be augmented by various cognitive tasks. These experiments clearly indicate that
we may find correlation between cognitive load and its relevance to CT education with
EEG signals.
To observe the cognitive load changes after CT education we have applied the
theta/beta ratio band power as the indicator for viewing the cognitive load level of
participants as Fitzgibbon did during the problem solving tasks, where high value
indicates high load to experiment.

3.2. Questionnaire
Items to measure the problem solving competency need to be designed so that it may
minimize the effects of a specific subject‟s prior knowledge, and enable the measurement
of actual competency during the problem solving process. For this, we selected the CTbased problem solving test designed by [15] which is derived from the OECD / PISA
problem solving questions and modified for undergraduate students. The questionnaire
consists of 3 main categories and 8 sub-elements of CT competency. A total of 16
questions were designed and some examples are shown in the appendix.

after the 10 learning sessions (30 hours in total), the problem solving competency test
(paper-based) and EEG measurement of the frontal lobe were conducted between a CTgroup (who participated CT skill education, and a NCT-group (who did not participate CT
course).
CT competency tests for college students [15] were applied to measure general
problem solving ability and problem solving questions of PISA was used for the EEG
measurement.

Figure 1. EEG Test Schedule
Brain activity was measured with 2 channels (Fp1 and Fp2) of 10/20 EEG
measurement system. To accurately measure brain activeness, measurement an electrode
arrangement system was used as in Figure 1 [16]. EMOTIV‟s wireless device, EPOC
Neuro Headset was used to measure the cognitive load of the participants, and the EEG
data was processed with EMOTIV‟s Test Bench. The measured analog signal data is
transformed to the digital signal with the Complexity 2.0 of Laxtha and EEG was
analyzed with a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
EEG measurement results may be affected by location, the condition of participants,
illumination and noise. Thus, to prevent the possibility of outside environments factors
that may interfere the validity of the experiment, the measurement was conducted in a
shielded room.

4.1. Analysis of CT based Problem Solving Test
A pre-CT based problem solving test was conducted for both CT and NCT groups.
According to the t-test results, both groups showed similar values in most areas, thus it is
possible to assume that participants of both groups have identical knowledge of CT
competencies.

If the p-value associated with the t-test is less than the significance level (<.05), then
the null hypothesis is rejected, and both groups have similar CT capabilities. On the
contrary, if p-value is greater than the significance level (>.05), it fails to reject the null
hypothesis and both groups‟ CT capabilities are different [18].
From observing Table 2, all the p-value of each subdomain of CT skills are greater
than the significance level (>.05) except analytical thinking domain (<0.5), thus we can
conclude that both groups have no CT capability difference except analytical thinking.
To check the effectiveness of designed CT education course, CT based problem
solving test with problem isomorphs was given to the participants of both groups after 10
sessions of CT education.

Even though both groups‟ participants showed better scores than the pre-test, and the
score of CT-group participants are better than the NCT-group participants except analysis
and representation domains. However, the CT-group shows greater strength in questions
relating to solution strategy which consists of strategic and simultaneous thinking than
NCT-group. The CT-group‟s mean value of strategic thinking domain was 0.8438 while
the NCT-group got 0.6240 (<.05).
Also, in simultaneous thinking element, CT-group‟s mean value of 1.00 was higher
than the NCT-groups of 0.7778 (<.05). The t-test value was found to be highly significant
(<.01) between the CT-group and the NCT-group in terms of recursive thinking.
From these results, we can say that the designed course with Scratch programming was
effective to both groups‟ participants, however course designed with considering CT
concepts was more effective than basic computer skill course with Scratch programming.
4.2. Cognitive Load Changes with EEG Measurements
Emotion researched through EEG devices revealed that there exists correlation
between brain waves and cognitive states. For example, the alpha wave asymmetry
measurement on the frontal lobe shows the presence of states showing low cognitive load.
Meanwhile, some researchers [19, 20] reported that the relative theta/beta ratio in Fp1 and
Fp2 decreases in ratio values during cognitive load conditions compared to relaxing states.
Based on these research, we also recorded brain wave from Fp1 and Fp2 of frontal lobe
and analyzed relative band power of theta/beta ratio are depicted in the Figure 6.

Figure 3. Theta/beta Relative Band Power Ratios Appeared in the Test with
EEG
As previous research shows, the theta/beta ratio decreases during the test period (t1, t2
and t3) more than rest time period (r1, r2) in the CT group. This pattern clearly happens
in the CT group, but the NCT group‟s result show less small differences between test
period and rest period.
Also, the theta/beta ratio of the CT group decreases more than the NCT group, and the
ratio changes between test time and rest time is greater than that of the NCT group. These
patterns imply that participants of the CT group may allocate cognitive power to solve the
given problems. Another implication of this results is that CT group participants more
effectively use their cognitive power than the NCT group. In other words, the CT group
spent cognitive power more skillfully, when they have to pay attention or take rest.

5. Conclusion
Enhancement of computational thinking capabilities for freshmen level pre-teachers is
achieved through 10 sessions of Scratch programming integrated with introductory CS
course. Among the improvements of participants, solution strategy which consists of

176

strategic and simultaneous thinking, and strategic thinking domain show bigger
differences.
If learners are exposed to the opportunity of courses providing CT skill training
combined with computer application subjects, it may help them to enhance students'
problem-solving skills especially those associated with the ability of strategic thinking.
On the other hand, if learners have the opportunity to learn problem solving
strategies repeatedly, they may be better prepared to solve complex problems effectively
allocate their cognitive power.
This assumption has been proved from the direct measurement of EEG signals and the
theta/beta ratio pattern of Fp1 and Fp2 in frontal lobe. Even though, the t-test results of
the EEG measurement was not supported by statistical significance, it is expected that if
larger samples and more EEG channels are utilized then the learners' cognitive load
change may be more clearly proved with statistical significance.
