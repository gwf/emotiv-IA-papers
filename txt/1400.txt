The BCI competition IV stands in the tradition of prior BCI competitions that aim to provide high quality neuroscientific data for open access to the scientific community. As
experienced already in prior competitions not only scientists from the narrow field of BCI
compete, but scholars with a broad variety of backgrounds and nationalities. They include
high specialists as well as students. The goals of all BCI competitions have always been to
challenge with respect to novel paradigms and complex data. We report on the following
challenges: (1) asynchronous data, (2) synthetic, (3) multi-class continuous data, (4) sessionto-session transfer, (5) directionally modulated MEG, (6) finger movements recorded by
ECoG. As after past competitions, our hope is that winning entries may enhance the
analysis methods of future BCIs.

INTRODUCTION

Brain-computer interfacing (BCI) is an approach to establish a
novel communication channel from men to machines. The crucial idea is to directly tap the communication at its very origin:
the human brain. BCI technology is used to date primarily for
intentional control. This branch of BCI research aims at the
(partial) restoration and rehabilitation of lost functions in paralyzed patients (Kübler et al., 2001; Wolpaw et al., 2002). The
focus of the fourth BCI competition was on BCI systems that
are based on the motor and sensorimotor system of the brain.
In line with the past three BCI competitions, this fourth BCI
competition strives to help the field of BCI prosper by eliciting
solutions for hard data analysis problems appearing in current
BCI research.

www.frontiersin.org

Apart from communication and control, recently more and
more alternative applications of BCI technology are being explored
(Blankertz et al., 2010). These include enhancement of human
performance (Haufe et al., 2011) and assessing subconscious perception (Porbadnigk et al., 2010, 2011). Data from those recent
developments have not yet been included in the BCI competitions, but may pose interesting and novel challenges for future
competitions.
1.1.

RELEVANCE OF BCI COMPETITIONS

The impact of the past three competitions on the field of BCI
research is manifold and thus worth a closer look. One indicator
of the overall relevance of the BCI competitions for the scientific community is the number of citations. Figure 1 shows how

often the three overview articles on the past BCI competitions I
(Sajda et al., 2003), II (Blankertz et al., 2004), and III (Blankertz
et al., 2006) have been cited in ISI-indexed journals and conference proceedings. The overall sum is 255. From competition II
on, the concept was introduced to have publications of all winning algorithms within one issue of a journal. This worked very
well in the BCI competition II where all winner articles have been
published in volume 51 of IEEE Trans Biomed Eng (Blanchard
and Blankertz, 2004; Bostanov, 2004; Kaper et al., 2004; Lemm
et al., 2004; Mensh et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2004).
Such concerted publication leads to good visibility, and as a consequence to substantial citations, see Figure 2. (In competition III
only some winning algorithms were published spread cross several journals; Wei et al., 2006; Galan et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2007;
Rakotomamonjy and Guigue, 2008.)
Moreover, research groups that are relatively new to the field of
BCI can attract attention and get renowned if the performance of

Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neuroprosthetics

their algorithms is independently validated through the competition process. This is an attractive opportunity even for researchers
who do not have access to an acquisition device for brain signals
or a fully running BCI system. Additionally, some researchers of
the better performing teams were hired or hosted by BCI groups
(in particular the one contributing data sets to the competition).
Most important, the results of the BCI competitions provide
an indication of what type of methods are effective. A good example of such a lesson that can be learned from the competitions
is that common spatial pattern analysis (CSP/CSSD; Koles, 1991;
Ramoser et al., 2000; Blankertz et al., 2008b) and its variants are
a robust tool for exploiting ERD/ERS effects (Pfurtscheller and da
Silva, 1999): Almost all data sets throughout all BCI competitions
in which CSP was reasonably applicable (e.g., for multi-channel
recordings or for paradigms in which differential ERD/ERS effects
are expected) have been won by an algorithm involving a variant
of CSP: competition II (2a, 4); competition III (1, 3, 4a, 4c); competition IV (1, 2a, 2b). The success of the CSP-based methods in
the BCI competitions may have a promoting factor for the flourishing development of variants of CSP analysis (Lotte and Guan,
2011; Nikulin et al., 2011; Sannelli et al., 2011).
In contrast, the application of principle component analysis
(PCA) or independent component analysis (ICA), which are very
successful preprocessing methods in other application fields, seem
to be a less effective ingredient to improve the classification performance in BCI (but note, that ICA was used in Xu et al., 2004).
This advance of CSP compared to PCA and ICA may to a large
extend be explained by the different strategies concerning the use
of class labels. While CSP exploits the information contained in
the labels in a supervised manner, ICA and PCA are unsupervised
methods.
In this context, we would like to stress that the competitions
are by no means a systematic evaluation of all available algorithms.
Therefore, we would still like to encourage to explore the full realm
of signal processing and pattern recognition algorithms for BCI.
1.2.

THE ROLE OF OPEN DATA

BCI research is complex, and to design an online BCI experiment
or successfully run a BCI application involves the cooperation of
specialists from various disciplines. The availability of BCI data
from past competitions is an important contribution to stimulate the interdisciplinary engagement of students and researchers
from neighboring research areas, who can enrich the field of BCI.
This is especially true for scientists specialized in signal processing, data analysis, and machine learning, but also for researchers
from the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). While these
specialists have the potential to improve the progress of BCI with
new algorithmic methods or improved usability of BCI applications, the field of BCI needs to provide the fuel, that is data. Data,
that on the one hand is typically noisy, high-dimensional, shows
non-stationary characteristics, and thus provides a challenging test
ground especially for the signal processing and machine learning
community. On the other hand, BCI data represents – if interpreted as a signal for communication and control – an inherently
unreliable and slow communication channel. From the viewpoint
of HCI, the field of BCI can be considered a challenge as it requires
highly robust interaction models in order to cope with the above

July 2012 | Volume 6 | Article 55 | 2

Tangermann et al.

Review of the BCI competition IV

mentioned challenges. Finally, any success story for the interaction
design in BCI might be transferable into the other fields like usability of mobile devices or gesture controlled applications, which
share some of these interesting characteristics.
1.3.

NOTES ON THE USE OF BCI-COMPETITION DATA

Despite of a number of high quality algorithmic solutions proposed by the competition winners in the following sections, the
actual learning problems posed in this competition are surely
of interest in the future, and the proposal of new methods for
their solution can enhance the field of BCI. For this reason, the
competition data sets have been provided online as open data. Furthermore, the labels of the test data, which have not been available
to the participants of the BCI competition IV, have been published
in addition.
We would like to encourage the use of this data and the publications of any results and insights. Upon publication of such results,
however, we would like to draw your attention to three important
aspects:
First, any performance improvement over the competition
results, should be reported with a note of caution, as it could merely
reflect random fluctuations. Ideally, the performance should be
reported for larger amounts of test data.
Second, a comparison with the performance of the competitors
should be drawn carefully only, as any post-competition work on
the same data has been performed under the advantage of knowing the competition outcome, knowing the specific shortcomings
of the submitted algorithms, and having insight into which classes
of algorithms perform better or worse on that data.
Third, even so the test data labels are publicly available now,
their use should be restricted to finally determine the performance
of a method. The test data should not be touched at all during the
algorithm design process and the determination of hyperparameters, as this can lead to a substantial amount of overfitting (Lemm
et al., 2011).
1.4.

RELEVANCE OF THE DATA SETS

For an overview, a list of data sets and the corresponding winning
teams is summarized in Tables 1 and 2.
The BCI competition fosters algorithmic solutions, which allow
for a single-trial assessment of mental states. For the neurosciences,
such developments in signal processing and machine learning are

clearly relevant as these single-trial data analysis methods provide
a possibility to monitor the acting and behaving brain. This is a
prerequisite to study the dynamics of brain processes, and eventually develop new reactive experimental paradigms, that vary, e.g.,
stimulus conditions depending on the current state in a closed
loop.
The data sets of this competition all deal with motor paradigms,
and more specifically with oscillatory signals which are related to
imagined motor actions or motor execution. As an example, direct
clinical relevance of BCI technology can be expected for the support of rehabilitation training in patients suffering from stroke
(Silvoni et al., 2011) in cortical motor areas. However, as changes
of oscillatory processes are not uniquely observed during motor
activities, but represent a rather general high-level characteristic of
many brain processes, the benefit of this BCI competition should
extend from motor system research to other fields.
Data set 1 of the BCI competition IV addresses the challenge
to correctly deal with intended non-control periods and uncued
periods of control activity. This is of high clinical relevance, as any
practical application of a motor imagery BCI system will require
that the BCI system recognizes periods of resting and coming back
to active BCI control.
Data set 2a enlarges the number of control classes from two
to four. Compared to the simpler setting of only two motor
imagery classes, this enlargement contains the risk of a reduction in classification accuracy. However, it also offers the potential
of higher information transfer rates, and more natural interaction
paradigms between user and application. In combination with
the continuous classification setting, this is clearly of practical
relevance.
Data set 2b challenges the session-to-session transfer of classification models. Avoiding the time-consuming re-calibration of
the BCI system, such approaches are of high practical importance
for end-users, who want to use a BCI on a daily basis.
Data set 3 is a collection of magnetoencephalography (MEG)
signals. While most motor paradigms in non-invasive BCI make
use of the lateralization of motor-related signals (e.g., ERD/ERS
effects over the left hand and right hand cortex), this data set seeks
to extract a multi-class decision from a single hand only. Comparable to data set 2a, the expansion from two to more classes
has the potential to boost the information transfer rate of a BCI.
Furthermore the data set is an example for the possibility to infer
hand movement directions not only from single cell spiking activity (e.g., by intra-cortical single unit recordings; Georgopoulos
et al., 1982; Velliste et al., 2008), which are known to realize a
directional coding, but also from non-invasive measurements of
larger populations (Waldert et al., 2008). Despite of its practical
restrictions (an MEG system is neither practical nor affordable
for patients), this MEG-BCI could still be applied in conjunction
with online feedback, e.g., for stroke rehabilitation attempts (Buch
et al., 2008) or for prosthesis training.
The goal for data set 4 of the BCI competition IV was to infer
the flexion of individual fingers from signals recorded from the
surface of the brain via electrocorticography (ECoG). Determining the relationship of ECoG signals with finger flexion provides
new neuroscientific understanding, and may eventually lead to
improved brain-computer interface systems.

OVERVIEW OF THE ARTICLE

After some general remarks concerning the concept and the BCI
competitions in Section 2, the subsequent five sections, will characterize each data set contained in the BCI competition IV in detail,
including an assessment of its relevance to the field, experimental
details, the data format, the applied evaluation criterion for submissions, and a brief outcome. The article closes with a section
about the overall results of the competition and a discussion. The
latter includes prospective topics of subsequent competitions.
The winning labs published individual articles on their
approaches, see (Ang et al., 2012; Flamary and Rakotomamonjy,
2012; Sardouie and Shamsollahi, 2012; Zhang et al., 2012).

GENERAL STRUCTURE OF THE DATA SETS AND THE
MACHINE LEARNING TASK
Challenges posed within the BCI competition typically contain
a problem description, a training data set, a test data set, and a
description of the evaluation metric that is applied to determine
the performance of contributed algorithms.
2.1.

TRAINING DATA

This collection of data (also called calibration data) comprises
the data epochs from EEG, MEG, or ECoG recordings, the labels
or markers that describe the tasks that were to be performed by
subjects at recording time, and the cues which had been presented to them. In addition, the groups providing the training data
describe the specific performance metric according to which any
participant’s competition entry will be rated. Participants used this
information to develop a processing method that was able to estimate labels based on data. Any method could only be successful,
if it generalized well on new test data.
2.2.

TEST DATA

This data set (also called evaluation data) contains data epochs,
but no labels or markers. The labels do exist but were secret to the
participants. The task of participants was to estimate the labels of
the test data and send them in. The data providing group evaluated the labels according to the predefined performance metric,
that had been published together with the training data.

2.3.

CAUSALITY OF METHODS

As the full test set is available to the participants from the beginning and not (as in a real online experiment) incrementally, the
participants could in principle exploit the structure of the full
(unlabeled) data already in advance in order to improve their
label estimate even for the first trials. The organizers are aware
of the problem, that this use of data is non-causal and unrealistic. Consequently it was not allowed for participants to exploit
this unrealistic advantage, that they could gain compared to a BCI
practitioner.
However, the distribution of test data is simplified to a large
extend, if it can be provided en bloc. In order to ensure causal processing despite of this distribution method, the participants had
to submit a short description of the developed data processing
routines. In case of unclear causality the participants had to prove
that their approach is causal by handing in the data processing
routines in addition to the labels.

3. DATA SET 1
Data set 1 Asynchronous Motor Imagery is provided by B. Blankertz,
C. Vidaurre and K.-R. Müller from Berlin (Germany). It can
be freely assessed via http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/with the
only restriction that the present article is referenced upon any
publication of results.
3.1.

MOTIVATION

Most demonstrations of algorithms on BCI data are evaluating
classification of EEG trials, i.e., segments of EEG signals of a fixed
length, where each trial corresponds to a specific mental state. But
in BCI applications with asynchronous feedback, e.g., cursor control, one is faced with the problem that the classifier has to be
applied continuously to the incoming EEG without having cues of
when the subject is switching her/his intention. This data set poses
the challenge of applying a classifier to continuous EEG for which
no cue information is given.
Another issue that is addressed in this data set is that the test
data contains periods in which the user has no control intention.
During those intervals the classifier is supposed to return to 0 (no
affiliation to one of the target classes).
As a special feature, some of the data sets were artificially generated. The idea was to have a means for generating artificial EEG

July 2012 | Volume 6 | Article 55 | 4

Tangermann et al.

Review of the BCI competition IV

signals with specified properties that are so realistic that they can
be used to evaluate and compare analysis techniques. The competition is a possibility to verify whether the applied methods
perform comparably on artificial and real data. The only information provided to the competitors was that there is at least one
real and at least one artificial data set, while the true distribution
remained undisclosed until the submission deadline. For competition purpose, only results for the real data set(s) were considered,
but results for artificial data were also reported for comparison.
See the subsequent Section 4 for a detailed description of the generation of the artificial data and a comparison of the competition
results obtained on real vs. artificial data.
3.2.

MATERIALS AND SUBJECTS

These data sets were recorded exclusively for the purpose of the
competition. Four healthy participants served as experimental
subjects. In the whole session motor imagery was performed without feedback. For each participant two classes of motor imagery
were selected from the three classes left hand, right hand, and foot
(side chosen by the individual; optionally also both feet).
3.2.1.

Experimental paradigm

The recording was made using BrainAmp MR plus amplifiers
(Brain Products GmbH, Munich, Germany) and a Ag/AgCl electrode cap (EASYCAP GmbH). Signals from 59 EEG positions were
measured that were most densely distributed over sensorimotor
areas. Signals were band-pass filtered between 0.05 and 200 Hz
and then digitized at 1000 Hz with 16 bit (0.1 µV) accuracy. Also
a version of the data was provided that was sub sampled at 100 Hz
[first low-pass filtering the original data (Chebyshev Type II filter
of order 10 with stop band ripple 50 dB down and stop band edge
frequency 49 Hz) and then calculating the mean of consecutive
blocks of 10 samples].
3.2.2.

Protocol

The session was divided into two parts: recording of training
data and recording of test data. Training data were provided with
complete marker information such that it could be used by the
competitors for adapting the parameters of the methods/models.
In contrast, the test data which was provided to the competitor
only consisted of the EEG signals. The corresponding markers
have been kept secret until the submission deadline and have been
used to evaluate the submissions.

FIGURE 3 | (Data set 1 – trial structure). Training data was collected in the
calibration runs. Arrows pointing left, right, or down have been presented as
cues for imagining left hand, right hand, or foot movements. After a fixation
cross was presented for 2 s, the directional cue was overlaid for 4 s. Then
the screen was blank for 2 s. In the test runs used for evaluation, spoken
words have been presented as cues.

3.2.2.2. Test data. Then 4 runs followed which were used for
evaluating the submissions to the competitions. Here, the motor
imagery tasks were cued by acoustic stimuli (words left, right, and
foot ) for periods of varying length between 1.5 and 8 s. The end of
the motor imagery period was indicated by the word stop. Intermitting periods had also a varying duration of 1.5–8 s. The acoustical
cues were soft-spoken it order to avoid that acoustically evoked
potentials could be detected to segment the data into control and
no-control intervals (or even to decode the cue information). In
each run, 30 trials for each class have been recorded resulting in
a total of 240 trials. After every 30 trials a break of 15 s was given
for relaxation. Between the runs there were longer breaks of 5–
15 min. Competitors were informed that the number of trials from
each condition was not necessarily equal. Due to the experimental
design, there were twice as much periods of no control as periods
of each condition.
Additionally, we introduced a kind of non-stationarity into the
test data by changing the environmental conditions. Occasionally
during the runs music (2 times) or videos (2 times) have been
played, or the participant was instructed to close her/his eyes (2
times). Each of those periods (during which the cue presentation
was not paused) lasted about 2 min.
3.3.

3.2.2.1. Training data. In the first two runs, arrows pointing
left, right, or down were presented as visual cues on a computer
screen. Cues were displayed for a period of 4 s during which the
subject was instructed to perform the cued motor imagery task.
These periods were interleaved with 2 s of blank screen and 2 s
with a fixation cross shown in the center of the screen. The fixation cross was superimposed on the cues, i.e., it was shown for 6 s,
see Figure 3. In each run 50 trials of each of the chosen two classes
have been presented, resulting in a total of 200 trials. After every
15 trials a break of 15 s was given for relaxation. Between the runs
there were longer breaks of 5–15 min.

INVESTIGATION OF THE DATA SET

The most stable effect of motor imagery is a modulation of the
sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs), see (Pfurtscheller and da Silva,
1999). For hand motor imagery an attenuation of the SMR amplitude over the contralateral motor area is expected. The effect of
foot imagery is more diverse. An attenuation of the SMR over the
foot area, which is on the midline of the motor cortex could be
expected, but is rarely observed and does not appear in the data
set. In most of the subjects, an increase of the SMR amplitude over
the hand areas is observed. This is also the case for the two participants (a and f) of this data set, who performed foot imagery.
Figure 4 gives an overview, of how this effect is reflected in the

CHALLENGE

The submissions were evaluated in view of a one dimensional cursor control application with range from −1 to 1. The mental state
of class one is used to position the cursor at −1, and the mental state of class two is used to position the cursor near 1. In the
absence of those mental states (intermitting intervals) the cursor
should be at position 0. Note that it is unknown to the competitors
at which intervals the subject is in a defined mental state. Competitors had to submit classifier outputs for all time points. To
measure the performance, the squared error with respect to the
target vector – that is −1 for class one, 1 for class two, and 0 otherwise – averaged across time points was calculated. Since the mental
state of the user does not abruptly change with cue appearance,
time points during transient periods (1 s starting from each cue)
were discarded from evaluation.
As stated above, it was declared that for competition purpose,
only results for the real data sets were considered, but results for
artificial data were also reported for comparison.
Additionally, participants were asked to optionally judge which
of the data sets were the artificially generated ones.
OUTCOME IN BRIEF

There were 24 submissions to data set 1. The winning team is
Zhang Haihong and colleagues from the Institute for Infocomm
Research, Singapore. They approached the task as a three class
problem with the rest class being the third class. For classification,

r 2 -difference in log band-power between the individually chosen motor
imagery tasks as scalp maps. Band-power was calculated in the frequency
band that is shown in the topmost row and averaged across the time interval
that is indicated in the middle row. Three of those seven data sets have been
artificially generated, see main text.

CSP was combined with a filter bank. A criterion based on mutual
information was used to select those features that were to be
fed into a radial basis function based neural network. Using this
approach, they obtained a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.382
(averaged across the four real data sets). For further details of
their method see (Zhang et al., 2012). The winners are very closely
followed by Dieter Devlaminck and colleagues from the University of Ghent, from the Psychiatric Institute of Guislain and
from the University Hospital Ghent, who obtained an MSE of
0.383. They employed multi-class CSP with a subject-specific frequency band and a multi-class support vector machine (SVM)
with ordinal regression. The results ranked 3rd to 5th have been
achieved by Kai Keng Ann and colleagues (Institute for Infocomm
Research, Singapore); Liu Guangquan and colleagues (Shanghai
Jiao Tong University, China), and Abdul Satti and colleagues (University of Ulster). All those three competitors also used CSP as
a pivotal step in combination with a filter bank (rank 3) or
with a subject-specific frequency band (ranks 4 and 5). Figure 5
shows histograms of the results of those five highest ranked
submissions.
To assess the results, it has to be taken into account that a classifier that gives the constant output zero has an MSE of about
0.5. The exact value varies between data sets since the length
of the motor imagery and no-control period was chosen randomly. Figure 6 gives a more detailed view on the performance
of the winning algorithm. It shows for the four data sets (rows)
normalized histograms of the classifier outputs – separately for
periods of the three mental states. In the left column the true
label is −1 (first motor imagery class), in the middle column
the true label is 0 (no control intention), and in the right column the true label is 1 (second motor imagery condition). The
value of the true label is indicated by a blue triangle in each
subplot. This figure makes clear that this data set poses really a
big challenge. Even for the best method among 24 submissions,
the results are not very satisfying. Interestingly, the no-control

algorithm (red line).
A guess on the question which data sets were artificially generated was submitted by 16 out of 23 competitors. The correct
categorization was revealed by two competitors (Astrid Zeman
and Manuel Moebius), 8 more competitors revealed 2 of the 3
artificial subjects, but one of those also considered one real data
set as artificial.

MOTIVATION

The BCI competition IV included an original ingredient compared
to past events: part of the data sets of the BBCI group were artificially generated. The motivation of this work was to check whether
or not EEG data can be created to have specific properties in order
to test new machine learning methods. If this was the case, the
algorithms applied to both, synthetic and real EEG, would produce comparable results. To test this hypothesis we analyzed the
ranking of the participants and the performance of the methods in
real and synthetic EEG. Brain data like EEG is often noisy and its
variables cannot be controlled easily. Synthetically generated data

MATERIAL

In the following, the single components of (artificial) EEG are
described separately. We start with the generation of artificial
EEG noise, which we divided into background noise and baseline drifts. Then we describe the generation of the µ (and β as
a first harmonic of µ) rhythm and its desynchronization (ERD)
due to the onset of motor imagery tasks. After that, we describe
the artifacts that have been added to the data (eye blinks and eye
movements) to include some more realistic noise in our signals.
Our synthetic EEG is computed as a superposition of potentials
from these three different systems (ongoing background noise,
task dependent rhythmic activity generated on the motor cortex
and eye related noise, eye blinks, and eye movements) which have
qualitatively different statistical and spatial properties.
4.2.1.

Background noise

Background noise in EEG can reasonably be assumed to be Gaussian distributed. The spatial and temporal characteristics, however,
are in general too complex to be adequately modeled using a simple parametric model (Huizenga et al., 2002; Bijma et al., 2003;
Freeman, 2004a,b, 2005, 2006). To solve this difficulty, we first
estimated the cross-spectrum from real EEG data in eyes open and
eyes closed conditions and then generated an arbitrary amount of
data according to the estimated (complex) cross-spectral matrix
in the following way:
Let xi (f ) be the Fourier transform of simulated white Gaussian
noise for N data points for channel i with i = 1. . .M. Since typically (and in the case of our data) the estimated cross-spectrum
C(fi ) at discrete frequencies fi is based on averages of relatively
short time windows (duration: 1 s) and N denotes the length of
the complete data set, the frequency resolution of the measured
cross-spectra is much lower than the frequency resolution of xi (f).
We estimate C(f ) as a linear interpolation:
� �
f − f1 � � f2 − f � �
C f ≡=
C f1 +
C f2
f2 − f1
f2 − f1

(1)

with f1 (f2 ) being the largest (smallest) value of the set (fi )
lower (higher) than f. Then we scale x ≡ (x 1 (f ), x2 (f ),. . .,xM (f ))T
Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neuroprosthetics

(2)

Finally, the simulated noise data in the channel i is calculated as
the inverse Fourier transform of yi (f ). The resulting background
noise was a superposition of different amounts of each type of
noise, depending on the condition. Figure 8 depicts noise in conditions eyes open and eyes closed at the 10-Hz frequency. One can
observe that the power at this frequency is varying in the occipital
region, as expected in real EEG data.
4.2.2.

Baseline drifts

Baseline drifts are typically observable in unfiltered electroencephalographic signals (cf. Simons et al., 1981; Henninghausen
et al., 1993) and this is also the case for the BCI-competition data.
After analyzing the real “raw” EEG of the competition, we observed
both, relatively fast and slow drifts of the signal (shown in Figure 9)
and accordingly created two types of artificial drifts. These drifts
were generated using the cross-spectrum of the background noise,
but simulating a higher sampling frequency, which had the effect of
producing a slower signal (noise) than the background itself. The
selected frequencies for this computation were 150 and 300 kHz,
respectively (the original sampling frequency was 1 kHz).
4.2.3.

Event-related desynchronization

Forward calculation For the generation of ERD we assumed fixed
spatial patterns calculated as potential maps from dipolar sources
within left and right motor areas (Geselowitz, 1967). Again, we
assumed that the data is Gaussian distributed. The frequency content, however, was restricted to a single frequency (chosen to be
12 Hz) with a width δf = 1 Hz. We assumed that the generators of
this rhythm were radial dipoles with the origins to be 3 cm below
electrodes C3 and C4 for the left and right side activity, respectively (see Figures 10 and 11). The directions “radial” and also
“below”were chosen according to the surface normals at electrodes
C3 and C4. For the forward calculation we assumed a realistic
volume conductor consisting of three shells (scalp, skull, brain)

4.2.4.

Harmonic oscillations in the beta band

A harmonic component of the subject-specific µ rhythm can often
be observed in the β band (Huber et al., 1971; Pfurtscheller, 1981;
Pfurtscheller et al., 1996; Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, 1999;
Carlqvist et al., 2004; Nikulin et al., 2007). In our data sets we
have included such a harmonic component with different levels of
amplitude in relation to the µ rhythm, varying from 15 to 1% (see
Figure 12).
4.2.5.

Asymmetry in the amplitude of the rhythms

Typically, one can observe some asymmetry in the strength of the
desynchronization in each of the hemispheres (McFarland et al.,
2000; Mazaheri and Jensen, 2008; Nikulin et al., 2010). In a pair of
data sets and in order to create a more realistic EEG we added this
asymmetry in the rhythms that we generated.

locations for the two conditions, eyes open and eyes closed. Right: scalp
plot of the signal power at 10 Hz for the two conditions (eyes open and

solved using an analytic expansion of the EEG lead field (Nolte
and Dassios, 2005).

for each data set) and vice versa.

Generation of artifacts

Both for eye blinks and eye movements we assumed the generators
to be current dipoles placed within the eyes. The dipoles in the left
and right eye were activated simultaneously in a randomly chosen
superposition of a vertical and horizontal direction. The potentials
due to vertical dipoles were on average 10 times stronger than the
ones from horizontal direction. The topographies of vertical and
horizontal dipoles are shown in the upper panels of Figure 13.
While the spatial patterns were (on average) identical for eye
movement and eye blinks, the time courses were chosen differently. Time courses of eye movements were modeled as constants
with continuous on- and offsets as shown in the lower left panel of
Figure 13. The duration of the constant was set randomly between
0 and 2 s.
The time course of eye blinks was chosen as

Combining the ingredients

For each data set, the final EEG was generated by the linear combination of each element (background noise, baseline drifts, ERD,
and eye artifacts). The background noise was a superposition of
the cross-spectra in the conditions eyes open and eyes closed. The
amount of each type of cross-spectrum depended on the “environmental” conditions in which the virtual user was supposed to
be immersed: visual load (large amount of eyes open condition
and small amount of eyes closed condition), auditive load (small
amount of eyes open condition and larger amount of eyes closed
condition).
The ERD frequency was randomly chosen between 10 and
12 Hz for each user and a harmonic in the beta band (by doubling the µ rhythm frequency) was added as well. The position of
the dipoles generating the oscillatory activity could vary slightly
and randomly for each user. As already described, we also allowed
asymmetry of the µ rhythm amplitude in each hemisphere.

Then the eye movements and eye blinks were as well superimposed to the signal. One random time course was generated for
each of the data sets. Finally, the baseline drifts were added to the
total.
For the calculation, each element (ERD, background noise,
etc.) was normalized by its trace and the coefficient multiplying
each of them was manually selected, by computing the expected
performance using baseline methods (frequency band and time
interval subject-selected, then CSP computed using training data
and applied to test data). For more information please refer to
(Blankertz et al., 2008b).

CHALLENGE

As it was not revealed which of the data sets were real and which
were artificially generated. The challenge and evaluation criterion
was identical, see Section 3.4.
4.4.

OUTCOME IN BRIEF

A comparison of the similarity of real and synthetic data
was performed based on the result ranking (available via
http://bbci.de/competition/iv/results/). First, we analyzed the
position of the participants in the ranking. We calculated the correlation coefficient of the participants’ positions in both of the
data sets and obtained a result of 0.89, meaning that the position
of a participant in both rankings was highly correlated: a good
rank in the real data analysis yielded a good rank in the artificial
data analysis and vice versa. Also, we analyzed the performance
of the participants in the same way. We obtained a correlation
coefficient of 0.93, meaning that the performance of a participant
in both data sets was very similar. The linear fitting had a slight

positive bias (0.02), which shows that the performance measurement (mean squared error) was slightly higher for the synthetic
EEG (these data sets were a bit noisier than the real ones).
Summarizing, those algorithms doing well in the real data sets
also performed higher in the artificial data and vice versa.
4.5.

DISCUSSION

In this section we gave a description of the generation of synthetic EEG. We have described all its components, documented
our decisions, and detailed the calculation of each element.
We emphasize that more sophisticated EEG forward models
would include CSF as a fourth layer and that new research indicates
that the chosen conductivity ratio (1:50) might be too high. While
the simulation could be improved, almost all BCI methods work

entirely in sensor space and the exact details of the topographies
will hardly affect the results of the BCI task.
We have analyzed the results of the BCI competition IV and
shown the high correlation between the ranking and the performance measure in the real and artificial EEG in Figure 14. In this
specific context, the creation of synthetic EEG data sets has proven
to be useful.
Artificially generated EEG can be generated in large amounts.
Using it not only avoids performing real recordings, it can also be
fine-tuned, e.g., to contain a controlled amount of certain artifacts. Both characteristics are beneficial for an initial performance
evaluation of new algorithmic methods.
Although this was our first try to generate artificial data and the
methods can be further developed, we have shown a way to create

C3

data under controlled conditions, in order to test new methods
before performing actual experiments and this way boosting the
probability of success of new analysis methods in neuroscience.
In the future we will work on the improvement of the artifact
generation methods and develop an automatic way to combine
all the components of our synthetic electroencephalogram. Additionally, more tests should be done with the artificially generated
data, to assure that the correlation between real and synthetic EEG
is as high as shown in this report.

Review of the BCI competition IV

The cue-based BCI paradigm consisted of four different motor
imagery tasks, namely the imagination of movement of the left
hand (class 1), right hand (class 2), both feet (class 3), and tongue
(class 4). Two sessions on different days were recorded for each
subject. Each session is comprised of 6 runs separated by short
breaks. One run consists of 48 trials (12 for each of the four possible
classes), yielding a total of 288 trials per session.

Figure 17, left. All signals were recorded monopolarly with the left
mastoid serving as reference and the right mastoid as ground. The
signals were sampled with 250 Hz and bandpass filtered between
0.5 and 100 Hz. The sensitivity of the amplifier was set to 100 µV.
An additional 50 Hz notch filter was enabled to suppress line noise.
In addition to the 22 EEG channels, 3 monopolar EOG channels
were recorded and also sampled with 250 Hz (see Figure 17, right).
They were bandpass filtered between 0.5 and 100 Hz (with the 50Hz notch filter enabled), and the sensitivity of the amplifier was
set to 1 mV. The EOG channels are provided for the subsequent
application of artifact processing methods (Fatourechi et al., 2007)
and must not be used for classification.
A visual inspection of all data sets was carried out by an expert
and trials containing artifacts were marked. Eight out of the total
of nine data sets were analyzed in Naeem et al. (2006) and Brunner
et al. (2007, 2011).
All data sets are stored in the general data format for biomedical signals (GDF), one file per subject and session. However, only
one session contains the class labels for all trials, whereas the other
sessions are used to test the classifier and hence to evaluate the
performance. For details on the data set, the GDF files contained,
markers and functions provided for loading and evaluation, please
see Section A.1 in Appendix.

MOTIVATION

This data set challenges the session-to-session transfer of a three
class motor imagery task. Compared to other synchronous motor
imagery data sets, a continuous estimation of motor imagery class
labels is required. This represents a realistic setting for an online
control of a continuous output parameter.
5.2.

MATERIALS AND SUBJECTS

This data set comprises electroencephalographic (EEG) data from
9 subjects.
5.2.1.

Experimental paradigm

Protocol

At the beginning of each session, we recorded approximately 5 min
of EEG data to estimate the EOG influence. This recording was
divided into 3 blocks: (1) 2 min with eyes open (looking at a fixation cross on the screen), (2) 1 min with eyes closed, and (3)
1 min with eye movements. The timing scheme of one session is
illustrated in Figure 15. Note that due to technical problems, the
EOG block is shorter for subject A04T and contains only the eye
movement condition (see Table A1 in Appendix for a list of all
subjects).
All subjects were sitting in a comfortable armchair in front
of a computer screen. At the beginning of a trial (t = 0 s), a fixation cross appeared on the black screen. In addition, a short
acoustic warning tone was presented. After 2 s (t = 2 s), a cue in
the form of an arrow pointing either to the left, right, down, or
up (corresponding to one of the four classes left hand, right hand,
foot, or tongue) appeared and stayed on the screen for 1.25 s.
This prompted the subjects to perform the desired motor imagery
task. No feedback was provided. The subjects were instructed to
carry out the motor imagery task until the fixation cross disappeared from the screen at t = 6 s. A short break with a black screen
followed. The paradigm is illustrated in Figure 16.
5.3.

CHALLENGE

Participants were asked to provide a continuous classification output for each sample in the form of class labels (1–4), including
labeled trials and trials marked as artifact. A confusion matrix was
then built from all artifact-free trials for each time point. From
these confusion matrices, the time course of the accuracy as well
as the kappa coefficient was obtained (Schlögl et al., 2007b). The
chance level was at κ = 0. The algorithm used for this evaluation
was provided in BioSig. The algorithm achieving the largest kappa
value was declared the winner.
Due to the fact that the test data sets were not distributed until
the end of the competition, software had to be submitted. It had
to be capable to process EEG data files of the same format as used
for all training sets2 ) and produce the aforementioned class label
vector.
Since three EOG channels were provided, the software was
required to remove EOG artifacts before the subsequent data processing using artifact removal techniques such as high pass filtering

or linear regression (Schlögl et al., 2007a). The use of other correction methods was possible, but it was requested that artifacts
had no influence on the classification results.
All algorithms had to be causal, meaning that the classification output at time k was allowed only to depend on the current
and past samples xk ,x k−1 ,. . .,x 0 . In order to check whether the
causality criterion and the artifact processing requirements were
fulfilled, all submissions had to be open source, including all
additional libraries, compilers, programming languages, and so
on (for example, Octave/FreeMat, C++, Python, etc.). Note that
submissions could also be written in the closed-source development environment MATLAB as long as the code was executable in
Octave. Similarly, C++ programs could be written and compiled
with a Microsoft or Intel compiler, but the code had to compile
also with g++.

OUTCOME IN BRIEF

There were five submissions for this data set (see Table 3). All of
them used CSP features. The winning algorithm was submitted by
K. K. Ang, Z. Y. Chin, C. Wang, C. Guan, H. Zhang, K. S. Phua,
B. Hamadicharef, and K. P. Tee from the Institute for Infocomm
Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research Singapore.
Details of their approach are described in Ang et al. (2012). The
performance measure kappa was 0.57 averaged over all nine subjects. The other four submissions attained kappa values of 0.52,
0.31, 0.30, and 0.29 and thus were well above chance level of κ = 0.
The winning algorithm performed best in seven out of nine subjects; in two subjects, the algorithm that overall ranked second best
reached even slightly higher kappa values.
The winning algorithm requires MATLAB, but also runs on
Octave. It uses the BioSig toolbox to load the data. The algorithm

is based on the filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) variant (Ang et al., 2008). It was extended to the multi-class case
with one-versus-the-rest classifiers. First, artifacts were removed
by bandpass filters. Each classifier selected discriminative CSP
features using the Mutual Information Best Individual Features
(MIBIF4) algorithm (Ang and Quek, 2006) before Naive Bayes
Parzen Window classifiers (Ang and Quek, 2006) were used. The
classifier with the highest probability yielded the overall classification result. Due to the computationally intensive algorithms,
classification was performed every ten samples (in combination

with a zero-order hold for the samples in between). As the algorithm used 2 s of EEG data, the classification output was delayed
by 2 s.
5.6.

DISCUSSION

All five submissions yielded results well above chance level. As
a side note, four contributions were submitted by Asian-Pacific
groups. As already mentioned above, all contributions used CSP
features.
There were two major challenges in this data set. First, the contamination with eye movement artifacts could affect classification
accuracy; therefore we provided additional EOG channels. Second,
the classifiers trained on the training sessions should generalize on
unseen data recorded on a different day. The winning algorithm
addressed the first issue with a simple bandpass filter. Obviously,
the method is stable because it yielded good results on the test data.
However, the classification output is delayed by 2 s, which could
be a problem in online BCIs that incorporate real-time feedback.

6. DATA SET 2B
Data set 2b Session-to-Session Transfer of a Motor Imagery BCI
under Presence of Eye Artifacts is provided by R. Leeb, C. Brunner, G. R. Müller-Putz, and G. Pfurtscheller from Graz (Austria).
It can be freely assessed via http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/
with the only restriction that the present article is referenced upon
any publication of results.
6.1.

MOTIVATION

This data set focuses on the classification of electroencephalogram
(EEG) signals affected by eye movement artifacts. Furthermore
the session-to-session transfer of the algorithms has to be taken in
consideration, because all training and test data sets are recorded
on five different days.
The data set 2b contains the electroencephalogram (EEG) and
electrooculogram (EOG) activity of nine subjects. Technically
speaking, each data set consists of single-trials of spontaneous
brain activity during motor imagery, one part labeled (training
data) and another part unlabeled (test data), and a performance
measure. The goal is to infer labels (or their probabilities) for the
test data sets from training data that maximize the performance
measure for the true (but to the competitors unknown) labels
of the test data (this information is now, after the competition,
available as well).
6.2.

MATERIALS AND SUBJECTS

This data set consists of EEG data from 9 subjects of a study
published in Leeb et al. (2007). The subjects were right-handed,
had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were paid for participating in the experiments. All volunteers were sitting in an
armchair, watching a flat screen monitor placed approximately
1 m away at eye level. For each subject 5 sessions are provided,
whereby the first two sessions contain training data without feedback (screening), and the last three sessions were recorded with
feedback.
6.2.1.

Experimental paradigm

Each session consists of several runs, illustrated in Figure 18. At
the beginning of each session, a recording of approximately 5 min

FIGURE 18 | (Data Set 2b). Timing scheme of one session (for screening
and feedback sessions).

FIGURE 19 | (Data Set 2b). Electrode montage of the three monopolar

was performed to estimate the EOG influence. The recording was
divided into 3 blocks: (1) 2 min with eyes open (looking at a fixation cross on the screen), (2) 1 min with eyes closed, and (3)
1 min with eye movements. The artifact block was divided into
four sections (15 s artifacts with 5 s resting in between) and the
subjects were instructed with a text on the monitor to perform
either eye blinking, rolling, up-down, or left-right movements. At
the beginning and at the end of each task a low and high warning
tone were presented, respectively. Note that due to technical problems no EOG block is available in session B0102T and B0504E (see
Table A3 in Appendix for a list of all subjects).
6.2.2.

Protocol

Three bipolar recordings (C3, Cz, and C4) were recorded with
a sampling frequency of 250 Hz. The recordings had a dynamic
range of ±100 µV for the screening and ±50 µV for the feedback
sessions. They were bandpass filtered between 0.5 and 100 Hz, and
a notch filter at 50 Hz was enabled. The placement of the three
bipolar recordings (large or small distances, more anterior or posterior) were slightly different for each subject (for more details see
Leeb et al., 2007). The electrode position Fz served as EEG ground.
In addition to the EEG channels, the electrooculogram (EOG)
was recorded with three monopolar electrodes (see Figure 19,
left mastoid serving as reference) using the same amplifier settings, but with a dynamic range of ±1 mV. The EOG channels
are provided for the subsequent application of artifact processing methods (Fatourechi et al., 2007) and must not be used for
classification.
The cue-based screening paradigm (see Figure 20A) consisted
of two classes, namely the motor imagery (MI) of left hand (class 1)
and right hand (class 2). Each subject participated in two screening

sessions without feedback recorded on two different days within
2 weeks. Each session consisted of six runs with ten trials each and
two classes of imagery. This resulted in 20 trials per run and 120
trials per session. Data of 120 repetitions of each MI class were
available for each person in total. Prior to the first motor imagery
training the subject executed and imagined different movements
for each body part and selected the one which they could imagine
best (e. g., squeezing a ball or pulling a brake).
Each trial started with a fixation cross and an additional short
acoustic warning tone (1 kHz, 70 ms). Some seconds later a visual
cue (an arrow pointing either to the left or right, according to the
requested class) was presented for 1.25 s. Afterward the subjects
had to imagine the corresponding hand movement over a period
of 4 s. Each trial was followed by a short break of at least 1.5 s.
A randomized time of up to 1 s was added to the break to avoid
adaptation.
For the three online feedback sessions four runs with smiley feedback were recorded (see Figure 20B), whereby each run
consisted of twenty trials for each type of motor imagery. At the
beginning of each trial (second 0) the feedback (a gray smiley) was
centered on the screen. At second 2, a short warning beep (1 kHz,
70 ms) was given. The cue was presented from seconds 3 to 7.5.
Depending on the cue, the subjects were required to move the
smiley toward the left or right side by imagining left or right hand
movements, respectively. During the feedback period the smiley
changed to green when moved in the correct direction, otherwise
it became red. The distance of the smiley from the origin was set

www.frontiersin.org

according to the integrated classification output over the past 2 s
(more details see Leeb et al., 2007). Furthermore, the classifier output was also mapped to the curvature of the mouth causing the
smiley to be happy (corners of the mouth upwards) or sad (corners of the mouth downward). At second 7.5 the screen went blank
and a random interval between 1.0 and 2.0 s was added to the trial.
The subject was instructed to keep the smiley on the correct side
for as long as possible and therefore to perform the MI as long as
possible.
6.3.

DATA FORMAT

All data sets are stored in the general data format for biomedical
signals (GDF), one file per subject and session. However, only the
first three sessions contain the class labels for all trials, whereas
the remaining two sessions are used to test the classifier and hence
to evaluate the performance. For details on the data set, the GDF
files contained, markers and functions provided for loading and
evaluation, please see Section A.2 in Appendix.
6.4.

CHALLENGE

Participants were asked to provide a continuous classification output for each sample in the form of class labels (1, 2), including
labeled trials and trials marked as artifacts. A confusion matrix
was then built based on artifact-free trials only and for each time
point. From these confusion matrices, the time course of the accuracy as well as the kappa coefficient was obtained (Schlögl et al.,
2007b), which had a chance level of κ = 0. The algorithm used

Tangermann et al.

for this evaluation was provided in BioSig. The winner was the
algorithm with the largest kappa value.
Due to the fact that the evaluation data sets were not distributed
until the end of the competition, software had to be submitted. It
had to be capable to process EEG data files of the same format as
used for all training sets3 ) and produce the aforementioned class
label vector.
Since three EOG channels were provided, the software was
required to remove EOG artifacts before the subsequent data processing using artifact removal techniques such as high pass filtering
or linear regression (Schlögl et al., 2007a). The use of other correction methods was possible, but it was requested that artifacts
had no influence on the classification results.
All algorithms were required to be causal, meaning that the classification output at time k may only depend on the current and
past samples xk ,x k−1 ,. . .,x 0 . In order to check whether the causality criterion and the artifact processing requirements were fulfilled,
all submissions had to be submitted as open source, including all
additional libraries, compilers, programming languages, and so
on (for example, Octave/FreeMat, C++, Python, etc.). Note that
submissions could also be written in the closed-source development environment MATLAB as long as the code was executable in
Octave. Similarly, C++ programs could be written and compiled
with a Microsoft or Intel compiler, but the code had to compile
also with g++.

CSP (FBCSP) using mutual information rough set reduction
(MIRSR). Classification of selected CSP features was performed
using the Naïve Bayes Parzen Window classifier. A more detailed
explanation of the winning algorithm is given in a separate paper
(Ang et al., 2012).
Methods participant ID-2: The EEG was bandpass filtered in
different frequency bands and the EOG artifacts were removed
afterward. Common spatial subspace decomposition (CSSD)
were extracted from the preprocessed signals with optimized window sizes and a LDA discriminate function was made for each
time point.
Methods participant ID-3: CSP on spectrally filtered neural time
series prediction preprocessing (NTSPP) signals was applied to
all signals all subjects using the self-organizing fuzzy neural network (SOFNN). Furthermore the log variance of each filtered
channel was calculated with a 1-s sliding window. The best classifier among 3 variants of LDA and 2 variants of SVM was chosen
for each subject individually.
Methods participant ID-4: Wavelet packet transform was applied
only on electrodes C3 and C4 (Cz was ignored). Selected
frequency bands were extracted and concatenated to form a
multidimensional vector and classified with LDA.
Methods participant ID-5: EOG was removed with linear regression and the signals high pass filtered with 4 Hz. The algorithm
used spectral features in the mu and beta bands (from electrode
C3 and C4) as inputs for a neural network classifier.
Methods participant ID-6: EOG was removed with linear regression. Band-power features in 75 frequency bands for each channel
were extracted and selected with recursive feature elimination
(RFE). The remaining 6 features were classified with a Bayesian
LDA.
6.6.

RESULTS

In total six submissions were received and most were of high
quality. As defined above in section evaluation the kappa value
was chosen as the performance measure. Remember, the expected
kappa value, if classification is made by chance, is 0. In Table 4 the
first column shows the average kappa across all subjects, columns
2–10 show the results for the individual subjects. Four submissions
achieved a mean kappa of more than 0.4 on the test set. Furthermore the two best approaches (ID-1 and ID-2; Ang et al., 2012)
achieved nearly similar results (mean of 0.60 and 0.58). Actually
approach ID-2 could achieve the best single subject performances
for 4 subjects and ID-1 “just” for 3 subjects, but was always very
close to the best ones on a single subject level. Only subject 2
caused troubles to these algorithms. Interestingly is that approach
ID-4 achieved incredible good results here compared to the other
approaches. Generally the data from subject 8 and subject 4 could
be identified best, whereby subjects 3, 2, and 1 were challenging.
These findings are consistent over all approaches, if the standard
deviation over the approaches is taken into consideration.
6.7.

DISCUSSION

Two major challenges had to be addressed in this data set. The first
one was the influence of eye movement artifacts on the EEG and
the second one the generalization of the selected features to be successful on the session-to-session transfer. Like in real conditions

the data were from different sessions recorded on different days.
Looking at the results it is interesting to compare the performance
achieved on data sets of different subjects, while applying the same
signal processing algorithms. No method achieved good results on
all subjects. Especially the session-to-session transfer could have
been a source for the occurred problems. Although we provided
training data sets from three different days, 2 training data sets were
recorded without feedback and just 1 data set with feedback were
given, but of course we wanted to see the performance on online
data sets with feedback recorded later on different days. The winning algorithms could foster this problem best, but unfortunately
their method needed a 2-s delay to the predicted classification
output to achieve a better performance. This approach is very
useful if offline classification is performed, but for online control
applications such a delay causes a lot of problems for the BCI user.
Like in all the BCI competitions before, the data set and the
description will continue to be available on the competition web
pagehttp://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/. Other researchers interested in EEG single-trial analysis are welcome to test their algorithms on these data sets and to report their results. To imitate
competition conditions, all selections of method, features, and
model parameters must be confined to the training sets. However,
due to the current availability of the labels of the test data and the
publication of thorough analyses of these data, future classification results of the competition data cannot fairly be compared to
the original submissions.

S. Waldert, C. Braun, H. Preissl, N. Birbaumer, A. Aertsen, and

and the Institute of Medical Psychology and Behavioral Neurobiology (both University of Tübingen). It can be freely accessed via

7.1.

BACKGROUND

Spinal injury patients rank the loss of hand function as one of
the most debilitating features of their injury (Anderson, 2004).

www.frontiersin.org

An intuitive way to realize a brain-machine interface (BMI) is
to access the neural cortical activity that controlled natural hand
movements and translate this activity into commands that produce equivalent movements of external effectors (e.g., prosthetic
arm/hand, computer cursor). Such direct motor BMIs require that
kinematic parameters of the movement (e.g., movement direction
or velocity) can be inferred from the measured neuronal signals.
Online direct motor BMIs have until recently only been realized using spiking activity [single- (SUA) or multi-unit activity
(MUA), e.g., Hochberg et al., 2006; Velliste et al., 2008]. Only
in the last decade, it has been shown that not only spiking
but also neuronal population activity (Figure 21) is tuned to
the direction of hand movements. Tuning of neuronal population signals has been demonstrated in several studies using
either (a) invasive recordings (local field potentials, LFP; Mehring
et al., 2003) and electrocorticogram (ECoG; Leuthardt et al.,
2004; Schalk et al., 2007; Pistohl et al., 2008) or (b) non-invasive
recordings (electroencephalogram, EEG; Hammon et al., 2008;
Waldert et al., 2008; Bradberry et al., 2010; Lv et al., 2010; Wang
and Makeig, 2010) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG; Georgopoulos et al., 2005; Waldert et al., 2008; Bradberry et al.,
2009; Wang et al., 2010). Very recently, online direct motor
BMI control based on decoding movement direction was realized using MEG (Witte et al., 2010) and ECoG (Milekovic et al.,
2012).
Among all these studies, intra-cortical recordings (SUA, MUA,
LFP) yield the highest amount of information to be extracted
about movement direction (Waldert et al., 2009). However, these
signals require the implantation of micro-electrodes into the cortex and long-term stable recording of spiking activity remains
a difficult problem. Non-invasive EEG and MEG provide less
information, but allow for an easy access to human neural activity
without any medical risk for the subject. Obviously, current MEG
systems cannot be a basis for real-world direct motor BMI. However, MEG is convenient for BMI training and rehabilitation
attempts in patients (e.g., in stroke patients; Buch et al., 2008).
In this context, optimized algorithms for inferring kinematic
parameters from MEG signals could facilitate BMI training and
increase the performance of non-invasive direct motor BMIs. To
encourage the development of new algorithms, we contributed to
the BCI competition IV a data set containing MEG signals recorded
while subjects performed hand/wrist movements in four different
directions.

MATERIALS AND SUBJECT

The data set contained the signals of 10 MEG sensors (VSM
MedTech,Vancouver) above central areas measured at 625 Hz sampling rate during wrist movements of two healthy, right-handed
subjects. The subject sat relaxed in an MEG chair, the elbow rested
on a pillow to prevent upper arm and shoulder movements, and
the head was stabilized by small pillows. The task was to move a
joystick from a central resting position toward one of four targets
(right, left, forward, backward) using exclusively the right hand
and wrist. Movement amplitude was 4.5 cm. In each trial, the target was self-chosen by the subject, i.e., no directional visual cue
was provided. Visual trigger signals were presented on a screen
in front of the subject to start a trial or to indicate possible time
violations. A trial started with the joystick in the center position
and the appearance of a gray circle. After a variable delay (1–2 s,
Figure 22), the disappearance of the circle indicated the “go” signal (cued movement onset). Then, within 0.75 s the subject had
to start the movement and reach the target. For a trial to be valid,
the subject also had to rest at the target for at least 1 s. These
time constraints allowed for temporal consistency across trials
and the hold period at the target prevented interference of inand outward movements. A red cross was presented continuously
for fixation.

in a pseudo-random order. The number of trials per movement
direction was unequal but similar. The movement directions of
these test trials were not given but had to be predicted from the
MEG signals and submitted to the competition. Based on the submitted labels, we calculated the performance of the competitor’s
algorithms as the percentage of correctly classified trials (decoding
accuracy).

DATA FORMAT AND PERFORMANCE CRITERIA

Trials were cut to contain data from 0.4 s before to 0.6 s after movement onset. The signals were band-pass filtered (0.5–100 Hz) and
resampled at 400 Hz.
The data were provided as two Matlab “mat”-files, for subject
one “S1.mat” and for subject two “S2.mat.” Both files contained
the variable Info, which provided a detailed description of the
data. The second variable, training_data, contained 40 labeled trials per movement direction. These 160 trials were provided to
train and evaluate the decoding algorithms. The third variable,
test_data, contained 74 (for S-1) or 73 (for S-2) unlabeled trials

SUBMISSIONS AND ALGORITHMS

We received four submissions (ID-1 to ID-4) for this data set. The
submission showing best performance was well above chance level
for the unlabeled test data. It was submitted by
ID-1: Sepideh Hajipour Sardouie, Mohammad Bagher Shamsollahi. Biomedical Signal and Image Processing Lab (BiSIPL),
School of Electrical Engineering, Sharif Univ. of Techn., Tehran,
Iran.
The following short summary of the applied algorithms is based
on the descriptions provided by the competitors:

July 2012 | Volume 6 | Article 55 | 18

Tangermann et al.

ID-1: A comprehensive set of statistical features, frequencydomain features and wavelet coefficients was extracted from 12
channels (10 real channels plus 2 artificial bipolar channels). The
number of features was reduced using a supervised algorithm.
Then, a genetic algorithm selected features to optimize the classification accuracy. The classifier consisted of a combination of a
linear SVM and LDA. Details of this algorithm are published in
(Sardouie and Shamsollahi, 2012).
ID-2: First, a low-pass filter (cutoff 8 Hz) was used to filter the
time signal. Secondly, the time segment (0–0.5 s) was selected, that
is points 160–360. Third, the first three and five principal components of the abs and angle of the 128 FFT of each channel and
each sample were used. Then, Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA)
was applied to the frequency features to reduce the dimensionality. Fourthly, the signal were subsampled to 20 Hz. Then, FDA
was applied to the time features to reduce dimensionality. Finally,
Fisher discriminant functions were used for classification using
the combination of time and frequency features.
ID-3: Preprocessing unknown. The feature set consisted of statistical, temporal, parametric and wavelet coefficients and was
reduced by PCA and a genetic algorithm. The classifier was a linear
SVM.
ID-4: First, a low-pass filter (cutoff 8 Hz) was used to filter
the time signal. Secondly, the time segment (0–0.5 s) was selected,
that is points 160–360. Third, the first three and five principal
components of the abs and angle of the 128 FFT of each channel and each sample were used. Then, FDA was applied to reduce
dimensionality. Finally, Fisher discriminant functions were used
for classification using the frequency feature.

OUTCOME

All contributors applied either linear SVM, the linear Fisher discriminant analysis (LDA), or a combination of both. Algorithms
mainly differed in feature selection. Three competitors (ID-2/3/4)
achieved decoding accuracies around chance level of 25% only for
the test data (see Figure 23).
The winner applied a combined linear discriminant analysis
(LDA) and linear support vector machine (SVM) on features
selected from a large feature set by scattering matrices and a
genetic algorithm. The feature set comprised features extracted
from the time domain (e.g., AR coefficients, form factor), the frequency domain (e.g., energy in different frequency bands, mean
frequency), and the time-frequency domain (wavelet coefficients),
but not the low-pass filtered signals that were used in (Waldert
et al., 2008). Obtained accuracies on the test data were 59.5%
and 34.3% for subjects 1 and 2, respectively, and 46.9% on
average.

DISCUSSION

The performance of the competitors algorithms was lower than
that of an established decoding algorithm: the application of a regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA, also used in Waldert
et al., 2008) to the low-pass filtered and resampled signals of the
BCI-competition data resulted in a significantly higher average
accuracy of 62% (average across both subjects; p < 0.01 compared to the competition winner ID-1, Fisher’s exact test). Also
a linear SVM using the same low-pass filtered signals yielded a

comparison, the average result of applying a RLDA and linear SVM to the

higher average accuracy of 53% (significantly higher than ID2/3/4 (p < 0.01), not significantly higher than ID-1, Fisher’s exact
test).
ID-2 and ID-4 obtained much higher accuracies on the training
data (98% and 73%) than for the test data, which was classified at
chance level. This result indicates that the low accuracies for the
test data are due to a poor generalization. Possibly the same reason
explains the low accuracy for ID-3. However, the performance on
the training data was not available for this group.
Compared to the results of the winning group (ID-1), the
higher (RLDA) and equal (SVM) accuracies for the two standard
linear classifiers without sophisticated feature selection might be
explained by the fact that the low-pass filtered activity – which was
used in (Waldert et al., 2008) and which was, due to the applied
band-pass filter (0.5–100 Hz, see Data Format), also available in the
data set contributed to the BCI competition – was not included
in the predefined feature set used by the winning group. It is not
clear which decoding accuracies could have been achieved with
the algorithm of the competition winner if the low-pass filtered
activity were included. Especially this signal component contains
substantial information about movement kinematics and provides
high performance for decoding of neural population signals: LFP
(Mehring et al., 2003; Rickert et al., 2005), ECoG (Schalk et al.,
2007; Pistohl et al., 2008; Ball et al., 2009), EEG (Waldert et al.,
2008; Bradberry et al., 2010; Lv et al., 2010; Wang and Makeig,
2010), and MEG (Jerbi et al., 2007; Waldert et al., 2008; Bradberry
et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010).

MOTIVATION

The goal for data set 4 of the BCI competition IV was to infer
the flexion of individual fingers from signals recorded from the
surface of the brain (electrocorticography, ECoG). Compared to
EEG, where a higher spatial blurring prevents the detailed localization in single trial on the finger level, the ECoG signals provide
a much higher spatial resolution. This data set contained ECoG
signals from three subjects, as well as the time courses of the flexion of each of five fingers. The task in the competition was to
use the ECoG signals and flexion information in a training set
to predict finger flexion for a provided test set. The performance
of that prediction was evaluated by calculating the average correlation coefficient r between actual and predicted finger flexion.
We received five submissions for this data set. The results of these
submissions and recently published studies demonstrate that the
timing and degree of finger flexion can be accurately inferred from
ECoG in single trials.
Finger flexion is a simple parameter to correlate with an
extracted brain state, and thus can serve as a good test bed for
algorithm development. There are many potential implications of
successful algorithmic decoding of brain states: neural prosthetics, communication devices, handicapped vehicle control (wheelchairs, etc.), and potentially rehabilitation of the brain. The use of
motor areas related to hand movements is particularly compelling

Review of the BCI competition IV

in this context, because, as an area that is evolutionarily specialized for tool use, it may provide an intuitive basis for controlling
prosthetic hands or other manipulandums.
Electrocorticography (ECoG) is the measurement of mesoscale
electric potentials (1–5 mm) from the subdural brain surface. In
the data set provided for the BCI competition, all three subjects
who participated were epileptic patients receiving ECoG monitoring for the localization of seizure foci (Figure 24). In this setting,
ECoG has proven to be a powerful tool for brain-computer interfacing (Leuthardt et al., 2004; Schalk et al., 2008), and capable of
augmenting activity in the brain (Miller et al., 2010).
Several features can be extracted from the ECoG data that
may correlate with behavior. Motor-related event-related potentials can be extracted from the raw time series (Figure 25D). A
running average of the raw signal, termed the local motor potential (LMP; Schalk et al., 2007) has been shown to be informative
about task-related brain activity in motor cortex (Schalk et al.,
2007; Kubanek et al., 2009; Figure 26). In addition, frequencydomain features have been shown to robustly capture shifts in
behavioral state (Crone et al., 1998a,b; Miller et al., 2007). Shifts
in different frequency ranges often have different spatial patterns.
There is a characteristic decrease in power at low frequencies and
increase in power at high frequencies that accompanies movement
(Figure 27). The decreases in low frequency power have spatially

When captured, this broadband feature has been demonstrated
to be a robust correlate of finger movement at individual sites in
motor cortex (Miller et al., 2009b; Figures 26 and 30).
In this competition, participants used different techniques that
capitalized on different aspects of these signals to predict the
flexion of individual fingers from the ECoG signals.

broad distributions, and power increases at high frequencies have
spatially more confined distributions (Figure 28). Different fingers have spatially different representations on the brain surface,
and this can be used to help distinguish which finger might be
moving at any particular time (Figures 28–30).
Time-frequency estimates of power change can serve as robust
correlates of behavior (Figures 25 and 27). Recent studies have
demonstrated that what had been perceived as a spatially focal
high frequency phenomenon was really a reflection of a broadband
feature, likely corresponding to average firing potential rate of the

MATERIALS AND SUBJECTS

The three subjects in the data set were epileptic patients at Harborview Hospital in Seattle, Washington. Each patient had electrode grids placed subdurally on the surface of the brain for
the purpose of extended clinical monitoring and localization
of seizure foci. Each subject gave informed consent to participate in this study, which was approved by the internal review
board (IRB) of Harborview Hospital. All patient data have been
anonymized according to IRB protocol in accordance with HIPAA
regulations.
8.2.1.

Experimental paradigm

Signals from the electrode grid were amplified and digitized
using Synamps2 amplifiers (Neuroscan, El Paso, TX, USA). The
general-purpose BCI system BCI2000 (Schalk et al., 2004) provided visual stimuli to the patient, acquired brain signals from
the Synamps2 system, and also recorded the flexion of individual fingers (on the hand contralateral to the implanted grid)
using a data glove (Fifth Dimension Technologies, Irvine, CA,
USA). BCI2000 stored the brain signals, the timing of stimulus presentation, and the flexion of each of the fingers in a
data file. Data files were converted to MATLAB format for this
competition. Each patient had subdural electrode arrays (AdTech, Racine, WI, USA) implanted. Each array contained 48–
64 platinum electrodes that were configured in 8 × 6 or 8 × 8
arrangements. The electrodes had a diameter of 4 mm (2.3 mm
exposed), 1 cm inter-electrode distance, and were embedded
in silastic. Electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals (i.e., 62, 48,
and 64 channels from subjects 1, 2, and 3, respectively), were

since both are reflections of the broadband feature highlighted in
recent literature (Miller et al., 2009b). Low frequency changes are

spatially much more broad, corresponding to fluctuations in the classic
motor rhythms. Figure 29 shows that the spatial representations for
high frequencies are very different for different finger movement types,

• “train_data” – this variable, in time × channels, gave the first
2/3 (6 min, 40 s) of recorded ECoG signals (400,000 samples at
1 kHz sampling rate per channel) from the specified experiment,
for every channel.
• “train_dg ” – this variable, in time × finger was the first 2/3
(6 min, 40 s) of recorded finger position [thumb – index –
middle – ring – little; 400,000 samples (super-sampled to 1 kHz)
per finger] for the associated experiment.
• “test_data” – this variable, in time × channels, gave the last
1/3 (3 min, 20 s) of recorded ECoG signals (200,000 samples at 1 kHz sampling rate per channel) from the specified
experiment, for every channel. These data were used to predict the final 1/3 (3 min, 20 s) of recorded finger position
(thumb – index – middle – ring – little) for the associated
experiment.

Protocol

The subjects were cued to move a particular finger by displaying
the corresponding word (e.g., “thumb”) on a computer monitor
placed at the bed-side (Figure 30). Each cue lasted 2 s and was
followed by a 2-s rest period during which the screen was blank.
During each cue, the subjects typically moved the requested finger
3–5 times. This number varied across subjects and fingers. There
were 30 movement stimulus cues for each finger (i.e., a total of
150 cue presentations and about 90–150 flexions of each finger);
stimulus cues were interleaved randomly. This experiment lasted
10 min for each subject.
Subsequent offline analyses showed that ring (4th) finger movements were correlated with either middle (3rd) or little (5th) finger
movements. Thus, while this ring finger position was included with
the training data, it was not used for evaluation.

DATA FORMAT

The data for each subject was contained in a separate MATLAB file
that was named “subX_comp.mat ” where “X ” denotes the subject
number. Each file contained three variables:

(3 min, 20s) of predicted finger flexion for each of the five fingers (thumb – index – middle – ring – little) for the associated
experiment (200,000 samples per finger).

The channel order was scrambled so that the prediction task in the
competition was restricted to algorithmic optimizations only.
8.4.

CHALLENGE

Each participating group submitted three files titled “sub1_eval,”
“sub2_eval,” and “sub3_eval, ” corresponding to subjects 1–3,
respectively. Each of these contained a single variable, “eval_dg,”
with dimensions 200,000 × 5:

The evaluation criteria was as follows: for each subject, the
received variable “eval_dg ” was compared with the actual finger positions in “test_dg,” which was withheld. We calculated the
correlation coefficient r between the actual and the predicted finger flexions for each subject and finger. We did not calculate the
correlation coefficient for the 4th (ring) finger, because the flexion of this finger was typically correlated with the flexion of the
3rd (middle) or 5th (little) finger. The final score was calculated
as the arithmetic mean of the 12 correlation coefficients (4 per
subject, 3 subjects). The submission with the highest score won
the competition.

Flamary and Rakotomamojy employed a switching model to predict finger flexion. This method assumed that the output flexion of
the fingers is linear and that the transfer function between ECoG
signals and finger position depended on an internal state k that
represents the finger moving (1–5) or no finger moving at all (6).
They used ridge regression to compute the transfer function and
sparse linear regression to derive the state estimation. In brief, signals were first down-sampled by a factor of 4. The features for the
linear transfer functions were obtained with a Savitsky-Golay filter
(0.4 s, 3rd order). The features used for the state estimator were AR
coefficients computed on a moving window of 300 points. Once
the internal state was estimated, finger flexion was computed by
multiplying the features at a time t by the linear transfer function
corresponding to the state k at time t.

Liang and Bougrain first extracted, from each location, the timevarying activity in three frequency bands: 1–60, 60–100, and 100–
200 Hz. Then, the power in each bin was accumulated in 40 ms
time bins. The size of the time bin was chosen so that the resulting
amplitude modulation feature inputs had the same sampling rate
(i.e., 25 Hz) as that of the finger flexion values. Initial evaluations
found that each finger flexion was correlated to features from only
two or three particular locations. Therefore, features were automatically selected (separately for each finger and subject) using a
stepwise feature selection procedure based on the train and validation method (i.e., 2/3 of train data were used for training and
1/3 for validation). The resulting features were then submitted to
a Wiener filter with 25 tap-delays (i.e., using the present input and
the previous 1-s inputs for predicting the present finger flexion).

Salvaris first re-referenced signals to the common average, and
then down-sampled signals to 500 Hz. Bandpower features were
extracted by wavelet packets with sym9 wavelet and the average
of the time series. Features were then selected using WEKA’s CFS
algorithm. The selected features were used to train the SVR algorithm implemented in LibSVM. The parameters for SVR were
tuned through 5-fold cross validation. The resulting SVR model
was then used to classify the test data.

RESULTS

The goal of this portion of the competition was to predict finger
flexion for four of the five fingers on a test set (3 min 20 s) using a
classifier that was trained on a training set (6 min 40 s). The fidelity
of the prediction was assessed by computing the correlation coefficient between the actual finger flexion values and the submitted
finger flexion values. The result of a particular submission was the
arithmetic mean of 12 correlation coefficients (i.e., 3 subjects and
4 fingers).
Two of the five submissions achieved particularly strong predictions (see Table 5). Nanying Liang and Laurent Bougrain achieved

Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neuroprosthetics

an average correlation coefficient of 0.46, and thereby won this
competition. The runner-up contribution of Flamary and Rakotomamojy performed similarly well with a correlation coefficient
of 0.42. Details of the two approaches are described in Flamary
and Rakotomamonjy (2012) and Liang and Bougrain (2012).
While it is difficult to assess the difference in performance
between the different methods, it is interesting that methods that
are similar in simplicity to those used in Schalk et al. (2007) and
Kubanek et al. (2009) can reliably and robustly estimate finger
flexion from ECoG signals. That being the case, it may also be possible that more sophisticated methods that explicitly incorporate
physiological or physical constraints in the computational model
might further improve performance.

9. DISCUSSION
The BCI competition was created in order to support the development of algorithmic solutions for typical BCI problems. Does
it live up to its promise? The following sections attempt to give an
answer to the various aspects of this question.
9.1.

REST CLASS PROBLEM REMAINS A CHALLENGE

Moving from an artificial lab situation to the every-day use of a
BCI introduces a new challenge: periods of non-control, where a
BCI user is voluntarily switching to another (non-BCI) action or
is involuntarily distracted from the control interface. The distractor can be another active task (e.g., communication via a different
channel, the perception and processing of content, reasoning about
a decision to take) or simply taking a rest. The basic problem about
rest class detection in general is, that the resting state is not welldefined at all, and thus there is no reliable training data available
that can be used to calibrate the BCI system.
In this competition, the detection of such a rest class was challenged with data set 1. The results for this motor imagery data
set revealed, that most competitors had problems in correctly
identifying time periods of the rest class. Even considering the
performance of the competition winner (Figure 6) there remains
the wish for further improvement.
9.2.

TRANSFERABILITY TO ONLINE BCIs

The winning methods of this or earlier competitions are not necessarily transferable to be used in an online closed-loop BCI system.
While the runtimes of algorithms are not a real limitation, noncausal filters and time delays are problematic. As an example, the
winning algorithm of data set 2b predicted the class labels quite
accurately, but introduced a delay of 2 s during the preprocessing
eye artifacts. This is a trade-off that has to be considered for each
specific application.

July 2012 | Volume 6 | Article 55 | 24

Tangermann et al.

High robustness and generalizability of a winning algorithm
is another characteristic, that supports the applicability of an
algorithm for the feedback case. Comparable to earlier BCI competitions, again variants of CSP ruled the rankings. Of special interest
is the outcome, that the Singapore group has scored exceptionally
high for several of the data sets. As the submitted algorithms of
this group used similar concepts, this is a strong indicator for
robustness.
As some of the winning algorithms of earlier competitions have
indeed been adopted into the standard canon for BCI online control, we believe, that this will also happen for some algorithms of
the present competition.
9.3.

USEFULNESS OF SYNTHETIC DATA

The most reliable way of testing new algorithmic ideas for BCI is
to implement them in an online experiment, if possible with users
matching the target group. But even when testing with healthy
users, the testing effort is huge and can not be invested for every
change of the algorithmic model.
Synthetic EEG data as presented in data set 1-artificial might
offer a partial remedy to this problem. It has proven to be realistic
in the sense that the submitted algorithms performed very similar
on the synthetic and the real EEG data. As it is cheap to generate a
large amount of this data, at least initial algorithmic test beds can
be based on it. Precautions, of course, have to be taken in order to
avoid that the priors used for the EEG generation are not known or
explicitly exploited by the algorithms under test and their creators.
As simulated BCI classifier output has already successfully been
applied for the fine-tuning of BCI user interfaces (Quek et al.,
2011), the next step is on the horizon: to use simulated EEG that –
certainly only to a limited extend – models the user behavior, in
order to test BCI systems online in a closed loop.

10.

FURTHER TOPICS CONCERNING FUTURE
COMPETITIONS
Due to the development of the field of BCI, new data analytic
problems were identified, that are suitable for addressing them in
a BCI competition.
10.1.

WIRELESS AND DRY EEG SIGNALS

We currently observe the upcoming of easy-to-mount dry electrode caps as either research prototypes (Popescu et al., 2007;
Gargiulo et al., 2010; Luo and Sullivan, 2010; Saab et al., 2011;
Zander et al., 2011) or purchasable products (e.g., Sahara dry cap
by gTec, Mindset by NeuroSky, or Emotiv cap). As some of them
provide wireless transmission protocols, they open up the possibility to monitor the acting brain during real-life situations rather
than under artificial lab conditions.
The signals of these dry electrodes, however, currently still suffer from a number of artifacts, which are typically much weaker
or not present at all in wet electrode recordings. Examples are
inductive artifacts by persons moving in the same room, drifts
and saturation effects, or friction artifacts upon electrode movements. While an overall higher noise level of dry electrodes might
be difficult to overcome, some artifacts might be alleviated by suitable data processing. A future BCI data competition should thus
include a number of dry sensor data sets to determine the most
effective approaches.

Review of the BCI competition IV

10.2.

NON-STATIONARITY

Severe for the use of dry EEG sensors, but not restricted to this signal type, is the problem of non-stationarity in brain signals. In the
context of BCI, it is mostly observed during the transition from the
initial calibration phase to the online use of a BCI (Shenoy et al.,
2006; Sugiyama et al., 2007), but also within periods of online use,
where no obvious change of the task or paradigm takes place.
The reasons for non-stationarity in brain data can range from
external noise, over effects caused by high dimensionality and
robust estimation problems (Sannelli et al., 2008; Abrahamsen and
Hansen, 2011; task-unrelated) changes in the background brain
activity of BCI users (e.g., due to fatigue or artifacts; Winkler et al.,
2011, learning effects or adaptive behavior of the users; Ramsey
et al., 2009, or even co-adaptation of users and the BCI system
Vidaurre et al., 2011).
Non-stationarity can sometimes be observed even by bare eye in
the raw data, where it is present in the form of slow drifts, changes
in oscillatory sources, or changes in the noise level of electrodes. If
processed with an automatic classification or regression method
as in BCI, this processing can be harmed also by subtle bias shifts,
covariance drifts or changes of the covariance structure, or even
more complex changes of the data distributions.
Although a number of methods have been proposed to mitigate this problem either by finding a global stable subspace for the
data representation (Krauledat et al., 2007; Blankertz et al., 2008a;
von Bünau et al., 2009; Wojcikiewicz et al., 2011), or by adapting the online processing to compensate for ongoing changes (see
Vidaurre and Schlögl, 2008; Blankertz and Vidaurre, 2009; Sannelli
et al., 2011) for adaptation in motor-related tasks, and (Dähne
et al., 2011) for adaptation in ERP paradigms), it still is the source
of major problems in the online use of BCI. This qualifies the
problem of non-stationarity for becoming a target in future BCI
competitions.
10.3.

MULTIMODAL SIGNALS/HYBRID BCIs

Considering the predominant use of non-invasive BCI systems, it
is worth to briefly review the development of BCI performance
(e.g., in terms of communication rates) over time. On the positive
side, new BCI systems based on external stimuli have recently been
reported, that employed novel paradigms for auditory (Schreuder
et al., 2010, 2011; Höhne et al., 2011) and for visual ERP setups (Liu
et al., 2010; Acqualagna and Blankertz, 2011; Schaeff et al., 2011;
Tangermann et al., 2011; Treder et al., 2011). They improve over
long-used standard stimulation paradigms or can provide solutions for patients that have lost eye gaze control. In contrary, the
improvements reported for BCI systems based on motor imagery
and ERD/ERS effects have been slower over the last years, despite
of a drastic initial performance boost which was made possible by
the introduction of machine learning methods (Blankertz et al.,
2003, 2011; Schröder et al., 2003).
The next boost of BCI performance can be expected for paradigms, that are able to combine independent information from
different sources in order to improve the BCI control quality over
the level of a traditional single-source BCI. In an ERP setup, such
approaches could combine stimuli of different sensory modalities (Aloise et al., 2007). In motor imagery, the use of ERD/ERS
effects together with slower motor-related potentials (Dornhege

Tangermann et al.

Review of the BCI competition IV

et al., 2004) can increase information rates. Abstracting this concept to the next level, EEG signals could be combined with other
brain signal sources like fNIRS (Fazli et al., 2012), with non-neural
but physiological signals (e.g., heart rate variability, galvanic skin
resistance, pupil dilation, etc.) or in a hybrid setup (Millán et al.,
2010; Pfurtscheller et al., 2010; Müller-Putz et al., 2011) e.g., in
combination with non-BCI assistive technology.
We currently observe an expansion of BCI technology to other
fields. As it gives access to the real-time monitoring of mental
states (Müller et al., 2008), it is interesting for neuro-ergonomic
interface- and product design (Blankertz et al., 2010; Porbadnigk
et al., 2010). Furthermore it starts becoming a tool for the neurosciences, where the use of multiple sources of information is
an inviting possibility. All these fields can profit from processing
methods, that are capable of linking brain data with behavioral
data or with non-neural physiological signal types.
The challenge in processing signals from multiple sources is
to represent, combine and converge information in a way, that is
independent of different sampling rates (Bießmann et al., 2009;
Biessmann et al., 2011), SNR-levels or varying levels of nonstationarity. It is a great challenge with multiple facets. A next
BCI competition could contribute to the exploration of at least a
few of these aspects.
PERFORMANCE BASELINE FOR PARTICIPATION

The results of competition IV and the three past competitions
have shown, that the number of entries per data set varies to a
large extent, probably due to differing levels of effort that have to
be invested. Participants tend to submit more entries for standard
learning problems, e.g., classification problems where the percentage of correct classifications is the metric of choice. Non-standard
learning problems, even though representing important problems
in the field of BCI, tend to gain less attention.
As the success of a participant is finally expressed as a rank
among all submitted entries, the small sample ranking can

potentially be misleading with respect to the overall quality of
even the best-ranked entry. For this reason, it is planned to introduce a performance threshold in future BCI competitions. It will
be determined based on the test data. All entries have to pass this
threshold before they can enter the official ranking. The threshold
is to be defined by the data issuing group and should represent the
state-of-the-art performance that can be gained with established
analysis methods. The threshold is published together with the
performance metric and with a short description of the standard
method that leads to this performance.
We think that this action will contribute toward assessing the
absolute quality of a competition entry rather than the relative
quality only. On the long run the introduction of a threshold
can increase the perceived reliability of novel methods brought to
the BCI community via a BCI competition, and speed up their
adoption by BCI practitioners.

DATA SET 2A

All files are listed in Table A1. Note that the test sets will be made
available after the deadline of the competition (except for one file
from subject A01, which serves as an example). The GDF files
can be loaded using the open-source toolbox BioSig, available
for free at http://biosig.sourceforge.net/. There are versions for
Octave1 /FreeMat2 /MATLAB3 as well as a library for C/C++.
A GDF file can be loaded with the BioSig toolbox with the following command in Octave/FreeMat/MATLAB (for C/C++, the
corresponding function HDRTYPE ∗ sopen and size_t sread must
be called):

’OVERFLOWDETECTION:OFF’);
The workspace will then contain two variables, namely the
signals s and a header structure h. The signal variable contains 25 channels (the first 22 are EEG and the last 3 are EOG
signals). The header structure contains event information that
describes the structure of the data over time. The following fields
provide important information for the evaluation of this data
set:
h.EVENT.TYP
h.EVENT.POS
h.EVENT.DUR

[s,h] = sload(’A01T.gdf’);
Note that the runs are separated by 100 missing values, which
are encoded as not-a-numbers (NaN) by default. Alternatively, this
behavior can be turned off and the missing values will be encoded
as the negative maximum values as stored in the file with:
