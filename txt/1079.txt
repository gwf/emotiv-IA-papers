This paper presents results from an experiment using electroencephalography to measure
neurophysiological activations of mechanical engineers and industrial designers when designing and problem-solving. In this study, we adopted and then extended the tasks described in a
previous functional magnetic resonance imaging study reported in the literature. The block
experiment consists of a sequence of three tasks: problem-solving, basic design and open
design using a physical interface. The block is preceded by a familiarizing pre-task and then
extended to a fourth open design task using free-hand sketching. This paper presents the
neurophysiological results from 36 experimental sessions of mechanical engineers and
industrial designers. Results indicate significant differences in activations between the
problem-solving and the open design tasks. The paper focuses on the two prototypical tasks
of problem-solving layout and open design sketching and presents results for both aggregate
and temporal activations across participants within each domain and across domains.

1. Introduction
Designing is an activity that is carried out over time. Design research has focussed on
design cognition as a multimodal activity with a temporal aspect, different from
problem-solving (Dorst 2011; Gero 1990). The emerging field of design neurocognition distinguishes itself from the traditional field of cognitive neuroscience by
studying the temporal and multimodal behaviour involved in designing (Park &
Alderman 2018). Designing entails a range of cognitive activities that can take
minutes to generate solutions. Using neurophysiological measurements for assessing
well-defined cognitive processes that only take seconds, with repeated tasks, is a
reductionist viewpoint not applicable to the complex activities of concurrent cognitive processes occurring while designing. Neural responses of cognitive processes

cannot be observed in isolation from other ongoing processes (Benedek et al. 2019).
Shorter tasks do not allow gathering more complex behavioural assessments of
higher order cognitive functions. The advantages and disadvantages of different
neurophysiological measurements are beyond the scope of this paper. Designing
involves many different processes and strategies that may vary over time (Hay et al.
2017). Understanding how the brain interacts to produce higher cognitive functions
such as those involved in designing and disentangling its cognitive processes through
neurophysiological measurements asks for a macro perspective by distinguishing
phases or stages of designing from theoretical models (Gero & Kannengiesser 2004;
Hatchuel & Weil 2009). Measurements of brain activity while designing provide a
more objective foundation on which to confirm or build temporal theories of
designing, than do cognitive measurements from protocol studies alone. Design
neurocognition provides the context for the convergence of researchers from diverse
disciplines and encourages contributions from the fields of neurocognition, cognitive
psychology, neurophysiology, artificial intelligence and design theory, among others.
This research context allows testing and verifying to what extent designing is
different from other cognitive processes (Dorst 2011; Gero 1990) and how it unfolds.
The present study does not look into cognitive processes, but at the neurophysiological activations throughout entire design tasks performed by designers from two
different domains. We look at how problem-solving and designing translate into
neurophysiological activations and unfold over time with the cognitive processes
involved. We describe preliminary results from a controlled experiment that takes
advantage of the temporal resolution of electroencephalography (EEG). A low-cost
portable EEG device is used to measure neurophysiological activations across time
when mechanical engineers and industrial designers are problem-solving and
designing. This approach augments prior work on design cognition based on
protocol studies, comparing mechanical engineers and industrial designers.

1.1. Designing and problem-solving
The study of the cognitive behaviour of designers based on methods from cognitive
psychology, such as protocol analysis (Ericsson & Simon 1993; Crutcher 1994; Kan &
Gero 2017), has elucidated a number of characteristics of design cognition (Purcell
et al. 1993; Jiang et al. 2014; Hay et al. 2017). The notions of problem space and
solution space have populated design research interpretations of the designing
process (Dorst & Cross 2001; Kruger & Cross 2006) throughout its half century of
formal study (Jones & Thornley 1963). One of the initial and core research questions
is whether designing, as a cognitive process, is distinct from problem-solving (Goel &
Pirolli 1989, 1992; Visser 2009). In problem-solving all the characteristics of the
problem are firstly defined, therefore, problem-solving is a closed task based on
known constants and known variables. Designing involves the search for variables
that relate to what is not known, such variables are context sensitive, can bring
change and have variant meanings according to the design situation (Gero 1990). In
designing the characteristics of the problem are not all defined from the start, making
designing an open task. Variables are introduced and change through evaluation
processes and interdependencies within design issues (Vieira 2012). Distinguishing
designing from problem-solving has implications for design research and design
education in particular, since much of education is based on problem-solving
theories.

1.2. Neurophysiological studies in design research
Neurophysiological studies offer insights into brain activity during the designing
process. It has commensurability of measurements which makes such studies a
robust approach for design research (Pidgeon et al. 2016; Borgianni & Maccioni
2020). Neurophysiological design studies based on functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) started a decade ago (Alexiou et al. 2009) with a controlled
experiment reporting preliminary results on the distinction between designing
and problem-solving. Recent fMRI studies focussed on domain-related design
issues (Hay et al. 2020), sustainability judgments (Goucher-Lambert, Moss &
Cagan 2017), design ideation and inspirational stimuli (Goucher-Lambert, Moss &
Cagan 2019) of mechanical engineers, graphic designers (Ellamil et al. 2011), and
architects (Bermudez et al. 2017).
Studies using electroencephalography (EEG) commenced more than 40 years
ago (Martindale & Hines 1975) investigating cortical activation during multiple
tasks. Some 20 years later a study on categorization tasks of experts and novices
made use of EEG in design research (Göker 1997). In the last 10 years, single
domain-related EEG design studies (Nguyen & Zheng 2010; Vecchiato et al.
2015; Liu, Zeng & Ben Hamza 2016; Liang et al. 2017; Liang et al. 2018; Liu et al.
2018) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) design studies (Shealy,
Hu & Gero 2018; Shealy & Gero 2019) have been used to understand acts of
designing from a neurophysiological perspective. Design is a temporal activity.
EEG has started to play a role in design research because of its high temporal
resolution, readily available software, reduction in the cost of portable equipment and relatively little need for specialized training. This has made the
collection and analysis of EEG signals a viable option for design researchers.
The limitations of low-cost EEG equipment when compared to medical grade
systems, include low number of channels, physical stability, lower signal to noise
ratio, lower sampling rate and serial measurement of electrodes (lasting a
quarter of a second for the equipment used in this experiment). These are
addressed by scalp preparation prior to electrode fixing, contact quality, artifact
removal and filtering of the measurement to increase the signal to noise ratio,
and outlier analysis that reduces variability. The sampling rate of the low-cost
EEG device used in this study is higher than the cognitive activation rate found
in previous cognitive studies (Gero and McNeil 1998; Goldschmidt 2014). The
cognitive actions of interest while designing span multiple seconds (Kan & Gero
2017). Typical design sessions of 45 min generate between 600 and 1200
segments using protocol analysis, where each segment codes a cognitive action.
This results in an average between 2.25 and 4.5 s per action. This is well within
the capacity of a low-cost EEG device. Although low-cost EEG equipment has
lower signal to noise ratio potentially resulting in a higher variability of the
results and higher standard deviation than medical-grade equipment, the statistical approaches we describe in Section 2.6, compensate for the potential
effects on the results due to the limitations of the equipment. Low-cost EEG noninvasive portable equipment becomes a viable measuring tool for the level of
resolution we are interested in and for achieving preliminary results (Badcock
et al. 2013; Badcock et al. 2015; Bashivan et al. 2016; Hashemi et al. 2016;
Krigolson et al. 2017).

1.3. Electroencephalography temporal resolution
Electroencephalography records electrical brain activity with electrodes placed
along the scalp according to a standard distribution. Neurons transmit signals
down the axon and the dendrites via an electrical impulse. EEG activity reflects the
summation of the synchronous activity of thousands or millions of neurons that
have similar spatial orientation. When cells have similar spatial orientation, their
ions line up and create waves that can be detected. Pyramidal neurons of the cortex
are thought to produce the most EEG signal because they are well-aligned and fire
together (Sawyer 2011; Dickter & Kieffaber 2014). EEG measures electromagnetic
fields generated by this neural activity. Activity from deep sources of the brain is
more difficult to detect than currents near the skull, thus EEG is more sensitive to
cortical activity (Dickter & Kieffaber 2014; Hinterberger et al. 2014). Despite EEG’s
limited spatial resolution, it can offer high temporal resolution in the order of
milliseconds in a portable device. EEG’s high temporal resolution makes it a more
suitable tool than fMRI to investigate designing as a temporal activity. However,
fMRI offers both whole brain scans and a very high spatial resolution.

1.4. EEG results in design research
In design research, results from controlled experiments have identified neurophysiological EEG signals in which more visual thinking is spent during solution
generation than in solution evaluation of a layout task (Nguyen & Zheng 2010).
Further EEG bands associated with the design activities have been identified, namely
beta 2, gamma 1 and gamma 2 (Liu, Zeng & Ben Hamza 2016), higher alpha power
conducive for open ended tasks and divergent thinking, and theta and beta power
associated to convergent thinking in decision-making and constraints tasks (Liu et al.
2018). EEG has been used in the study of visual attention and association in expert
designers (Liang et al. 2017), visual communication during idea incubation in expert
and novice designers (Liang et al. 2018), the study of effort, fatigue and concentration
in conceptual design (Nguyen, Nguyen & Zeng 2017), and in the study of the
neurophysiological correlates of embodiment and motivational factors during the
perception of virtual architecture (Vecchiato et al. 2015).
This paper describes a study from a larger research project whose goal is to
investigate neurophysiological activation of designers across multiple design
domains, namely mechanical engineering, industrial design, graphic design and
architecture (Vieira et al. 2019a, 2019b, 2020a). The study reported in this paper is
based on the analysis of mechanical engineers’ and industrial designers’ neurophysiological activations using an EEG headset in the context of performing problemsolving and design tasks in a laboratory setting. The aims of the study are to:
(i) distinguish neurophysiological activations between designing and problemsolving for both mechanical engineering and industrial design domains.
(ii) distinguish neurophysiological activations between mechanical engineering
and industrial design domains.
In the research reported in this paper we test the following hypotheses:
(i) Hypothesis 1: the neurophysiological activations of mechanical engineers
when problem-solving and designing are significantly different.

problem-solving and designing are significantly different.
(iii) Hypothesis 3: the neurophysiological activations of mechanical engineers and
industrial designers are significantly different for problem-solving and
designing.
(iv) Hypothesis 4: the neurophysiological temporal distributions of activations of
problem-solving and designing are significantly different for mechanical
engineers.
(v) Hypothesis 5: the neurophysiological temporal distributions of activations of
problem-solving and designing are significantly different for industrial designers.
(vi) Hypothesis 6: the neurophysiological temporal activations of mechanical
engineers and industrial designers are significantly different for problemsolving and designing.

2. Methods
The research team of this study consisted of seven researchers including design
scientists, a data analyst, a statistician, a cognitive psychologist and a neurophysiologist. For the present study the analysis focussed on a subset of 55 experiment sessions
of mechanical engineering and industrial design professional participants. The tasks
and experimental procedure were piloted prior to the full study, through five different
sessions each of which produced changes resulting in the final experiment.
The hypotheses are tested by using a problem-solving task as the control/
reference and statistically comparing an open design task with the reference task.
We compare: absolute values known as transformed power (Pow) and task-related
power (TRP) described in Section 2.5. This study was approved by the local ethics
committee of the University of Porto.

2.1. Participants
The participants were a convenience sample, the subset of 55 experimental sessions
comprises 26 mechanical engineers and 29 industrial designers. Results are based
on 36 right-handed participants, 18 mechanical engineers, aged 25–40 (M = 28.9,
SD = 4.2), 10 males (age M = 29.0, SD = 5.3) and 8 females (age M = 28.7, SD = 2.5);
and 18 industrial designers, aged 25–43 (M = 31.7, SD = 7.3), 10 males (age
M = 35.1, SD = 7.2) and 8 females (age M = 27.5, SD = 5.1). The participants are all
professionals (experience M = 5.9, SD = 6.0). The sample has 20 participants with
experience in designing of 5 years or less, and 16 participants with experience in
designing of more than 5 years. The experience of the industrial designers compared to the mechanical engineers is statistically different. However, the analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA) indicates no significant effect of domain on the EEG scores
after controlling for experience, F(1, 33) = 2.3, p = 0.15.

2.2. Experiment tasks design
We adopted and replicated the problem-solving and layout design tasks described
in the Alexiou et al. (2009) fMRI-based study. We matched Tasks 1 and 2 with the
problem-solving and design tasks (Alexiou et al. 2009) in terms of requests,
number of constraints, stimuli and number of instructions (Appendix A). Task

Problem-solving

Task 2
Basic layout design

Task 4
Open sketching design

In Task 1, the design of
a set of furniture is
available and three
conditions are given
as requirements. The
task consists of
placing the magnetic
pieces inside a given
area of a room with a
door, a window and
a balcony.

In Task 2, the same
design set of furniture
is available and three
requests are made.
The basic design task
consists of placing the
furniture inside a
given room area
according to each
participant notions of
functional and
comfortable using at
least three pieces.

In Task 3, the same
design available is
complemented with a
second board of
movable pieces that
comprise all the fixed
elements of the
previous tasks,
namely, the walls, the
door, the window and
the balcony. The
participant is told to
arrange a space.

In the free-hand

participants are
asked to: propose
and represent an
outline design for a
future personal

system.

1 is considered a problem-solving task as the problem itself is well-defined, and the
set of solutions is both limited and unique (Alexiou et al. 2009). We extended that
experiment by adding an open layout design task to produce a block experiment in
order to determine whether the open layout design task produces different results
to the semi-closed layout Task 2 (Table 1). Both design tasks have no predetermined final state and the tasks are open-ended. Thus, the block experiment
consisted of a sequence of three tasks: problem-solving layout design, basic layout
design and open layout design (Figure 1). We added a fourth completely open
design task that uses free-hand sketching after Task 3. Task 4 is an ill-defined and
fully unconstrained task unrelated to formal problem-solving. Each participant
was given two sheets of paper (A3 size) and three instruments, a pencil, graphite
and a pen (Figure 1). The three design tasks (Tasks 2–4) require defining the
problem and the solution spaces in a successive order of complexity. A neurophysiological subtraction between the problem-solving Task 1 and the design tasks
will reveal brain magnetic fields more strongly involved in designing.
The set of four tasks was preceded by a pre-task so that participants could get
used to the interface and headset. In the pre-task, the participant had to place a set

of components for the design of a hair dryer. As with all block experiments, each
subsequent task was potentially primed by the previous task. The Mikado pick-upsticks game was given to the participants to play in the breaks between tasks
(Figure 2). Results across the tasks were previously reported on single and twodomain studies (Vieira et al. 2019a, 2019b, 2020a). For this paper, the focus is only
on Tasks 1 and 4. Task 4 is an open design task while Task 1 is a well-defined, highly
constrained problem, these are the two extremes of the way requirements of design
tasks are presented. Task 4 has been selected because it has been used in previous
protocol analysis studies of mechanical engineers and industrial designers and
results about designers’ cognition are available (e.g. Jiang 2012).

2.3. Setup and procedure
A tangible interface for individual task performance was built based on magnetic
material for easy handling (Figure 3). Differently from the original tasks (Alexiou
et al. 2009), the magnetic pieces were placed at the top of the vertical magnetic
board to reduce signal noise due to eye and head horizontal movements. The pretask was designed so that participants could familiarize themselves with the use of
the EEG headset and with maneuvering the magnetic pieces that make up the
physical interface and prevent participants from getting fixated in the problemsolving task, Task 1. This pre-task was also intended to familiarize participants with
postural and facial movements and allowed the researcher to correct and fine-tune
necessary adjustments before advancing to the block experiment.
Participants are instructed to wash their hair prior to attending the experiment
session to improve contact quality. One researcher was present in each experiment
session to instruct the participant and to check for recording issues. A period of
10 min for setting up and a few minutes for a short introduction was necessary for
informing each participant, reading and signing of the consent agreement and
setting the room temperature. Each participant was reminded to use the bathroom,
spit out any gum and asked to untie their hair before the start of the experiment.
The researcher checked metallic accessories for electromagnetic interference and
contact lenses. The researcher sat at the desk and checked posture of each
participant. In order to reduce excessive signal artifacts, the researcher asked each
participant as far as possible to avoid neck movements, blinking, muscle contractions as well avoid rotating their head, horizontal eye movements, pressing the lips
and teeth together during the tasks. The researcher followed a script to conduct the
experiment so that each participant was presented with the same information and

stimuli. Before each task, participants were asked to start by reading the text
describing the task which took an average of 10 s. Then the participants performed
the sequence of tasks (Figure 2). The participants were asked to stay silent during
the tasks and use the breaks for talking and clarifications. If needed, extra time was
given to the participants, in particular in Task 4, so they could find a satisfactory
solution. Instructions given to the participants are reported in Appendix A.

2.4. Data collection methods
EEG activity was recorded using a portable 14-channel system Emotiv Epoc+.
Electrodes are arranged according to the 10–10 I.S standard (Figure 3).
Electromagnetic interference of the room was checked for frequencies below
60 Hz. Each of the Emotiv Epoc+ channels collects continuous signals of electrical
activity at their location. The participants performed the tasks on the physical
magnetic board, with two video cameras capturing the participant’s face and
activity and an audio recorder. All the data captures were streamed using Panopto
software (https://www.panopto.com/) that also allows for direct screen capture,
Figure 4.
A total of 100 experimental sessions constitute our major dataset of which
90 took place at the University of Porto, between March and July of 2017, and June
and September of 2018. Ten sessions took place in the Design Hub of Mouraria,
Lisbon, during August 2018 in rooms with the necessary conditions for the
experiment, such as natural lighting sufficient for performing experiments between
9:00 and 15:00 and no electromagnetic interference. Only the 55 that involved
either mechanical engineers or industrial designers are considered in this paper.

2.5. Data processing methods
The 14 electrodes were disposed according to the 10–10 I.S. (Figure 3) 256 Hz
sampling rate, low cutoff 0.1 Hz, high cutoff 50 Hz. Several methods in the
literature (Mannan et al. 2018) seek to split the EEG signal into components,
assuming that the measurements are characterized by two different underlying
patterns, whose mathematical correlations between similar components and noncorrelations between different components can be empirically extracted along the

signal measured in time. We adopted the blind source separation (BSS) technique
based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for the removal of muscle artifacts
from EEG recordings (Borga & Knutsson 2001; De Clercq et al. 2006) adapted to
remove the short EMG bursts due to articulation of spoken language, attenuating
the muscle artifacts contamination on the EEG recordings (Vos et al. 2010). The
BSS–CCA algorithm, by using correlation as a criterion to measure independence
of signals, takes into account temporal correlation. By establishing an ordering
system of the separated singular valued components of the signal, the outputted
components are sorted so that the highest correlated sources represent EEG
sources and the lowest correlated sources represent noise. By systematically
eliminating a subset of the bottom sources, the EEG signals from all subjects used
in this study were cleaned. More specifically, by turning the last four sources to
zero, the cleaned EEG signal is reconstructed as a combination of the remaining
sources identified. Thus, data processing includes the removal of Emotiv specific
DC offset with the Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter and BSS–CCA. Data
analysis included total and band power values on individual and aggregate levels
using MatLab and the EEGLab open source software. All the EEG segments of the
recorded data were used for averaging throughout the entire tasks, from beginning
to end. Unpublished results testing the BSS–CCA procedure’s efficacy on EEG
signals from participants performing sketching tasks in three conditions including
pen and paper confirm its 99% efficacy. The statistical approach we describe in
Section 2.6, compensates for the potential effects on the procedure due to the
limitations of the equipment. As Task 4 involves muscular activity given that
participants sketched, the procedure described in De Clercq et al. (2006) was used.
All the tasks of this experiment involve thinking and motion. The motor actions
involved in the tasks using the tangible interface versus the free hand sketching and
their corresponding EEG signals are of the same source, thus we claim that the
BSS–CCA procedure filters the signal.

Each of the Emotiv Epoc+ channel’s continuous electrical signal is processed to
produce multiple measures. Here, we report only on two: transformed power (Pow)
and task-related power (TRP). The Pow is the transformed power, more specifically
the mean of the squared values of microvolts per second (μV/s) for each electrode’s
processed signal per task. This measure tells us about the amplitude of the signal per
channel, per participant magnified to absolute values. We present Pow values on
aggregates of participants’ individual results, for each domain cohort, per total task
and for each task deciles for the temporal analysis. The TRP is the task-related power,
typically calculated taking the resting state as the reference period per individual
(Dickter & Kieffaber 2014; Schwab et al. 2014; Rominger et al. 2018). This method
that is normally time-locked to fractions of seconds. In this study, we time-locked on
a scale of multiple seconds to allow for the design activity to unfold. We make a shift
of the focus on time-locking the experiments equally for all participants, to the
unfolding of the designing and problem-solving cognitive activities until the solution
is produced. Thus, our experiment is time-locked for the complete unfolding of the
cognitive activities involved in each task.
Of the 55 sessions recorded, 7 had recording problems that rendered them
unsuitable for further analysis and were excluded from further analysis. These
problems ranged from failing to switch on all the equipment, equipment failures,
participants’ handedness and failure to complete the experiment. We processed the
Pow and the TRP measurements for each participant per total task and temporal
deciles per task, then after determining the outliers, we calculated the mean and
standard deviation of each measure for each cohort. A z-score was conducted in the
analysis of Pow across tasks for each of the remaining 48 participants data to
determine outliers. The criteria for excluding participants were based on the evidence
of 6 or more channel threshold z-score values above 1.96 or below 1.96 and
individual measurements above 2.81 or below 2.81. This resulted in a further eight
sessions being excluded leaving 40. After the division of the Pow into time deciles
(which provides the basis for the analysis of temporal stages) amplitude leading to 2.5
standard deviations from the mean as threshold values were excluded per channel,
4 experiments were further excluded leaving 36, 18 per domain.

2.6. Data analysis methods
As the focus of the study is to determine how well neurophysiological activations
during designing can be distinguished from those during problem-solving, we take
the problem-solving task, Task 1 as the control/reference period for the TRP
calculations. Thus, for each electrode, the following formula was applied taking
the log of the Pow of the corresponding electrode i (of 14), in Task 1 as the reference
period. By subtracting the log-transformed power of the reference period (Powi,
reference) from the activation period (Powi, activation) for each trial j (per
participant), according to the formula:
TRPi ¼ log ðPowi , activationÞ j  log ðPowi , referenceÞ j

(1)

By doing this, negative values indicate a decrease of task-related power from the
reference (problem-solving Task 1) for the activation period, while positive values
indicate a power increase (Pfurtscheller & Lopes da Silva 1999) (power and
activation refer to brain wave amplitude).

2.7. Statistical approach
We performed standard statistical analyses based on the design of the experiment:
always a mixed repeated-measures design with pairwise comparisons to follow up
on specific differences with task, hemisphere, electrode and decile as within-subject
factors and domain as the between-subjects factor. These analyses were performed
for the dependent variable of Pow and for all the within-subject variables. The
threshold for significance in all the analyses is p ≤ 0.05. We further describe each
statistical comparison performed in relation to the hypotheses and the methods
used. To compare the Pow of the tasks within domain we performed an analysis by
running a 5  2  7 repeated-measurement ANOVA, with the within-subject
factors of task, hemisphere and electrode (Appendix B). We then compared the
Pow of the tasks between domains and performed an analysis by running a
5  2  7 repeated-measurement ANOVA, with the between-subjects factor
domain and the within-subject factors of task, hemisphere and electrode
(Appendix B). To investigate the temporal behaviour within each domain, we
performed an analysis by running a 5  2  7  10 repeated-measurement
ANOVA, with the within-subject factors of task, hemisphere, electrode and decile
(Appendix C). To compare the Pow for the temporal analysis in deciles across
domains, we performed an analysis by running a 5  2  7  10 repeatedmeasurement ANOVA, with the between-subject factors of task, hemisphere,
electrode and decile (Appendix D). We used only the results for the two tasks of
interest from the analyses of the full data set.

3. Analysis of results
3.1. Task-related power across domains
The TRP results for the two domains and tasks are depicted in Figure 6. The radar
plot simulates the two hemispheres by distributing the electrodes (10–10 I.S.)
symmetrically around a vertical axis. Total TRP scores per electrode can be
considered by comparing with the vertical scale and across the tasks (Figure 5).
Once the problem-solving Task 1 (reference task) is subtracted from itself to
produce the reference, it shows up as an orange circle with a value of zero for all
electrode measurements. The difference is shown as higher or lower activation of
the electrodes/regions for Task 4 within or beyond the orange circle border. The
sketching Task 4 shows higher neurophysiological activation compared to the Task
1 in both domains.

3.2. Analysis of transformed power within domains
Pow results for each domain cohort are depicted in Figures 6 and 7. Pow scores per
electrode (average of entire task) can be considered by comparing the vertical scale
values and across the two tasks. The open sketching design Task 4 shows higher
neurophysiological activation from Task 1 in both domains, Figure 6. Mechanical
engineers show higher activations in the problem-solving Task 1. Detailed analysis
results from running the 5  2  7 repeated-measurement ANOVA for each
domain are presented in Appendix B. Below, we report on significant (p ≤ 0.05)
differences, the channels of significant differences between the two tasks within
domain are shown highlighted with a solid circle. The circles indicate significant

effects for the mechanical engineers but not task. Task, hemisphere and electrode
are further investigated in the temporal analysis, presented in Section 4.

3.3. Analysis of transformed power across domains
Detailed analysis results from running the 2  5  2  7 mixed repeatedmeasurement ANOVA are presented in Appendix B. We conducted pairwise
comparisons to check for differences comparing the seven electrodes per hemisphere and task across domains. Below, we report on significant (p ≤ 0.05)
differences (Figure 7). The channels of significant differences per task between
domains are shown highlighted with a solid circle. The circles indicate significant
differences from the pairwise comparisons that were conducted to follow up on the
main effects and interaction effects. The pairwise comparisons revealed that the
open design sketching Task 4 shows significantly different neurophysiological
activations from problem-solving Task 1 (p < 0.01).

Significant main effects

From the analysis of the 36 participants, we found significant main effects and
significant interaction effects between multiple factors (Table 3). Of particular
interest is the significant main effect related to the tasks. No significant main effect
was found for the between-subjects factor domain (p = 0.67).

• hemisphere (p < 0.001)
• electrode (p < 0.001)

• domain and hemisphere (p = 0.02)
• hemisphere and electrode (p < 0.01)

These significant main effects provide evidentiary support for Hypothesis 3 concerning differences between problem-solving and designing across the two domains.

4. Temporal analysis results
Designing is a temporal activity, a single value based on aggregating across an
entire session hides how designing unfolds over time. Different cognitive behaviours exhibited when design sessions are divided into deciles show this temporal
activity in designing (Jiang et al. 2014; Kan & Gero, 2017). The division of each
design session’s data into temporal deciles allows a more detailed analysis of the
temporal dimension stages.

4.1. Problem-solving and design tasks of mechanical engineers
To compare the Pow scores for the deciles by domain, we performed an analysis by
running a 5  2  7  10 repeated-measurement ANOVA, with the within-subject
factors of task, hemisphere, electrode and decile, for each domain (Appendix C).
4.1.1.

Significant main effects

From the analysis of the 18 mechanical engineers we found significant main effects
and significant interaction effects between the factors shown in Table 4.
In addition, we conducted pairwise comparisons for hemisphere, electrode,
decile and task.
The significant main effects for mechanical engineers relate to task and to decile
and the significant interaction effect relates to task + decile. These provide
evidentiary support for Hypothesis 4. For a more detailed analysis, we carried
out pairwise comparisons that showed differences comparing hemispheres for the
seven electrodes and tasks within each decile.
The significant (p ≤ 0.05) pairwise comparisons found between Task 1 (problemsolving task) and Task 4 (open free hand sketching task) across the deciles (Appendix
C) are shown in Figure 8. Solid circles represent the channels with activation of
statistically significant differences in Task 4 from Task 1. Problem-solving Task
1 shows increased general activation in some deciles (1, 2 and 5), Task 4 shows higher
variation of temporal distributions of activations across deciles.
The placement of the electrodes related to each cortex of the brain is shown in
Figure 9. Higher activations of channels of the right occipitotemporal cortex and
secondary visual cortex occur in Task 4. Statistically significant differences between
the open sketching design Task 4 and problem-solving task, Task 1 occur in the
prefrontal cortex, right temporal and visual cortices. The channels of significant
differences with decreased activation from Task 4 to Task 1 are located in the
prefrontal cortex.

4.2. Problem-solving and design tasks of industrial designers
To compare the Pow scores for the deciles we performed the same analysis as for
the mechanical engineers by running a 5  2  7  10 repeated-measurement
ANOVA, with the within-subject factors of task, hemisphere, electrode and decile
(Appendix C).
4.2.1.

Significant main effects

From the analysis of the 18 industrial designers we found significant main effects
and significant interaction effects between the factors as shown in Table 5.
In addition, we conducted pairwise comparisons for hemisphere, electrode,
decile and task. The pairwise comparisons indicate that Task 4 differs significantly
from:
• problem-solving Task 1 (p < .01)
The significant main effects for industrial designers relate to task and the significant interaction effect relates to task + decile. These provide evidentiary support
for Hypothesis 5.
The pairwise comparisons showed differences comparing hemispheres for the
seven electrodes and tasks within each decile. In Figure 10, we show significant
(p ≤ 0.05) pairwise comparisons found between Task 1 (problem-solving task) and
Task 4 (open free hand sketching task) across the deciles (Appendix C).
Generally, higher activations of channels of the right occipitotemporal cortex
and secondary visual cortex are shown in Task 4. Statistically significant differences
between Task 4 and problem-solving Task 1 occur bilaterally in the dorsolateral
prefrontal, temporal and visual cortices. All the channels of significant differences
show increased activation from Task 1 to Task 4.

4.3. Problem-solving and design tasks across domains
Detailed analysis results from running the 2  5  2  7  10 mixed repeatedmeasurement ANOVA are presented in Appendix D. We conducted pairwise
comparisons to check for differences comparing the 7 electrodes per hemisphere,
task and decile across domains. Below we report on significant (p ≤ .05) differences.

effects related to task + deciles and task + domain. No significant main effect was
found for the between-subjects factor domain (p = .28).
These significant main effects relate to task and decile and the significant
interaction effects relate to task and domain and task and decile provide evidentiary
support for Hypothesis 6 concerning differences in temporal distributions of activations between problem-solving and designing, between tasks and across domain.

5. Discussion and conclusion
With this controlled experiment we showed evidence for significant differences
between two prototypical problem-solving and open design tasks, between two
cohorts from the domains of mechanical engineering and industrial design. The
neurophysiological differences of task-related power between problem-solving
Task 1 and the sketching Task 4, support a number of inferences:

(i) Significant higher amplitudes in the open sketching design Task 4 for both
cohorts were measured, meaning that from this study open design sketching,
as expected, is the most distinguishable design activity from problem-solving
thinking mode. The relevance of sketching while designing has been studied
(Goldschmidt 1994; Scrivener, Ball & Tseng 2000; Kavakli & Gero 2001; Bilda,
Gero & Purcell 2006). Our preliminary results show higher amplitude for
sketching at the aggregate level. Further analysis of the data might reveal other
aspects when comparing novices and experienced designers (Vieira et al.
2020a), categorical stages (Vieira et al. 2020b) and the conceptual categories of
the participants’ sketching solutions.
(ii) Dissimilar amplitude results found in the open sketching design Task
4 between domains could involve differences in the confidence in sketching,
as sketching skills might differ between these mechanical engineers and
industrial designers. This could have influenced the results in particular, of
the channel P8, whose cognitive functions are associated with drawing
(Harrington et al. 2007).
(iii) Dissimilar adaptive approaches can be inferred as the constraints of the magnetic
elements and physical solution space of Task 1 disappeared in Task 4. Industrial
designers showed higher change of activations implying a greater adaptation to
the open design task. This supports prior cognitive results that show mechanical
engineers do not necessarily change nor adapt their approach when constraints
are reduced, and more freedom of choice is given (Jiang et al. 2014). Probably
due to their education, mechanical engineers show higher amplitudes in channels related to deductive reasoning, F7 (Goel et al. 1997) and lower amplitudes in
channels associated with inductive reasoning, F3 and P7 (Goel et al. 1997).
(iv) Hemisphere and electrode significant differences were found between the two
tasks for both cohorts for all of the within-domain analyses. Channels of
significant differences between Task 1 and Task 4 were found in the occipitotemporal and prefrontal cortices.
We further discuss these channels associated with Brodmann areas’ specific cognitive functions and the hypotheses of this study. EEG measures electromagnetic fields
generated by neural cortical activity, as a consequence no direct inferences can be
made in relation to cognitive functions activity from deep sources of the brain
(Sawyer 2011; Dickter & Kieffaber 2014; Hinterberger et al. 2014). However, we can
infer that each channel is associated with the cognitive functions of the Brodmann
area onto which it is mapped in the brain hemispheres. Brodmann’s studies on brain

and correlated to various cortical functions and cognitive activities by measuring
blood flow in response to different mental tasks, Figure 11.
Research using fMRI over the past decades has contributed to the development
of our understanding about the localization of function in the brain and has helped
shape a consensus (Dickter & Kieffaber 2014). Multiple magnetic resonance
imaging measurements have resulted in an extended map (Glasser et al. 2016),
with each discrete area containing cells with not only similar structure, but also
function and connectivity. Various cognitive functions and connectivity have been
identified in studies using fMRI and positron emission tomography (PET).

5.1. Hypotheses
Statistically significant differences were found indicating preliminary evidence for
some of the hypotheses. The results of the analysis of the EEG data of the
36 participants showed differences in the neurophysiological activity of these
cohorts of mechanical engineers and industrial designers across tasks and provide
initial support for five of the six hypotheses.
• Hypothesis 1: the neurophysiological activations of mechanical engineers when
problem-solving (Task 1) and designing (Task 4) are significantly different.
Results from the repeated-measurement ANOVA for this domain do not support
Hypothesis 1. For these mechanical engineers, statistically significant differences
were not found between the open sketching design Task 4 and problem-solving
Task 1. However, main effects were found for hemisphere and electrode. This is
consistent with recent results between open-ended and constrained tasks of
product design engineers where no significant differences were found (Hay et al.
2020). However other aspects are revealed by the temporal analysis.
• Hypothesis 2: the neurophysiological activations of industrial designers when
problem-solving (Task 1) and designing (Task 4) are significantly different.
Results from the repeated-measurement ANOVA for the industrial designers,
show statistically significant differences between the open sketching design Task
4 and the problem-solving Task 1, providing support for Hypothesis 2.

• Hypothesis 3: the neurophysiological activations of mechanical engineers and
industrial designers are significantly different for problem-solving and designing.
From the results of the mixed repeated-measurement ANOVA across domains, no
significant main effect was found for domain, meaning that a common design
ground is shared by the cohorts. However, an interaction effect between domain
and hemisphere was found. These hemispheric differences will be explored in a
future paper.
Statistically significant differences between the open design sketching Task
4 and the problem-solving Task 1 were found. Although differences can be found
from the analysis within domain, the two cohorts as a whole, show significant
differences between designing and problem-solving prototypical tasks, providing
support for Hypothesis 3.
The pairwise comparisons show significant differences between the tasks in
channel P7 between domains. In the left hemisphere, channel P7 maps on
Brodmann area 37 involved in lexico-semantic associations and semantic categorization (Gerlach et al. 2000), attention to semantic relations (MacDermott et al.
2003), metaphor comprehension (Rapp et al. 2004) and deductive reasoning (Goel
et al. 1998). It could be inferred that mechanical engineer’s specific domain training
sets them to prioritize some of these cognitive functions over others. The open
requests of the task might not correspond to the specific nature of the requests these
mechanical engineers are used to responding to. They may not be using the
metaphorical and associative nature of exploring within the problem space
(Goel & Pirolli 1989, 1992), nor producing a solution-focussed primary concept
(Darke 1979; Cross 2006; Dorst 2011, 2015) before carrying out an analysis of the
proposal. Further research is needed to elucidate this potential explanation.
Pairwise comparisons within domains revealed significant differences in two
channels between the tasks. The mechanical engineers exhibit higher amplitude of
FC6 in Task 4, and industrial designers start with lower amplitude of this channel
in Task 1 and progressively surpass in amplitude that of mechanical engineers in
Task 4. The channel FC6 is associated with the cognitive functions of Brodmann
area 44. In the right hemisphere onto which it is mapped, BA 44 cognitive functions
of interest are associated with goal-intensive processing (Fincham et al. 2002) and
search for originality (Nagornova 2007). The open design requests of Task
4 prompt them to explore and plan ahead within the problem and solution space
(Dorst & Cross 2001). The mechanical engineers and the industrial designers also
show significant differences in channel O1, associated with the cognitive functions
of Brodmann area 18. In the left hemisphere onto which it is mapped BA18 is
associated with the cognitive functions of visual mental imagery (Platel et al. 1997)
and visual word form (Vorobyev et al. 2004), such cognitive functions are associated with open designing.
• Hypothesis 4: the neurophysiological temporal distributions of activations of
problem-solving (Task 1) and designing (Task 4) are significantly different for
mechanical engineers.
Results from the repeated-measurement ANOVA within domain, show statistically significant difference between the open sketching design Task 4 and the
problem-solving task, Task 1, across deciles for the domain of the mechanical
engineers. This provides initial support for Hypothesis 4.

In addition to the channels FC6, O1 and P7, the pairwise comparisons show
significant differences between the tasks across deciles for the channels AF3 (deciles
1 and 2), O2 (decile 8) and AF4 and T7 (decile 10). Channel AF3, which maps onto
the left prefrontal cortex, is associated with the cognitive functions of Brodmann area
09, such as deductive reasoning (Goel et al. 1997) and metaphoric comprehension
(Shibata et al. 2007). Higher activation of these areas involves semantic and pragmatic processing which differ from those in literal comprehension. The mechanical
engineers show significant differences and lower amplitude in channel AF3 in Task
4 for the first two deciles inverting the tendency from decile 4.
Channel O2, which maps onto the right occipitotemporal cortex, is associated
with visuo-spatial information processing (Wabersky et al. 2008). The mechanical
engineers show significant differences for this channel only in decile 8.
In the last deciles, mechanical engineers show significant differences for
channel O1 previously mentioned, and channels T7 and AF4. Mapped onto the
temporal cortex of the left hemisphere, channel T7’s known associated cognitive
functions are not easy to relate to design cognition. However, its higher activation
during visual word recognition (Pekkola et al. 2005) may suggest that it relates to
generating internal representations of speech from reading the design request.
Mapped on the right hemisphere, prefrontal cortex, channel AF4, which is
associated with the cognitive functions of coordinating visual spatial memory
(Slotnick & Moo 2006), planning (Fincham et al. 2002) and decision-making
(Rogers et al. 1999), shows significant differences in the last decile.
• Hypothesis 5: the neurophysiological temporal distributions of activations of
problem-solving (Task 1) and designing (Task 4) are significantly different for
industrial designers.
Results from the repeated-measurement ANOVA within domain, show statistically significant difference between the open sketching design Task 4 and the
problem-solving task, Task 1, across deciles for the domain of the industrial
designers. This provides initial support for Hypothesis 5.
The pairwise comparisons show significant differences between the tasks for
the industrial designers across deciles. Besides channels AF4, FC6, O2, O1, P7, T7,
F3, AF3 with their cognitive functions, significant differences were also found for
channels F4, F8, T8 and P8, which all map onto the right hemisphere.
Channels F4 and F8, which map onto the right prefrontal cortex, show
significant differences in deciles 6 and 10. Channel F4 is associated with the
cognitive functions of Brodmann area 08, of executive control (Kübler, Dixon &
Garavan 2006) and planning (Crozier et al. 1999). Channel F8 is associated with
the cognitive functions of Brodmann area 45, such as response inhibition (Marsh
et al. 2006), probably reflecting preparing to finish the task. Channel T8, which
maps onto the right temporal cortex, is associated with the cognitive functions of
Brodmann area 21, such as observation of motion (Rizzolatti et al. 1996). Industrial
designers’ training skills in sketching develops attention to gestures, and this
translates in higher activation. Channel P8, which maps onto the right occipitotemporal cortex, is associated with the cognitive functions of Brodmann area
37, such as monitoring shape (Le, Pardo & Hu 1998), visual fixation (Richter
et al. 2004) and drawing (Harrington et al. 2007). Industrial designers show
significant differences for this channel in 8 of 10 deciles in which we infer they
prioritize some of these cognitive functions in open design requests.

• Hypothesis 6: the neurophysiological temporal activations of mechanical engineers and industrial designers are significantly different for problem-solving and
designing.
Results from the mixed repeated-measurement ANOVA, revealed no significant
main effect for domain. However, an interaction effect between domain and task
was found and this provides initial support for Hypothesis 6.
Results from this study, in particular the results from the industrial designers,
provide preliminary evidence to the initial and core research question whether
designing is distinct from problem-solving (Goel & Pirolli 1989, 1992; Visser 2009)
at least on the level of neurophysiological activations between a problem-solving
layout task and an open sketching design task. The differences found between
mechanical engineers and industrial designers in terms of activations match
differences found in cognitive studies of mechanical engineers and industrial
designers, where mechanical engineers did not change their cognitive behaviour
related to the openness of the task, but industrial designers did (Jiang et al. 2014).
However, a common design ground was also found for these two design activities
as the analyses show no effect for domain, and significant differences between the
tasks across deciles were found for both. The results from this EEG study provide
an alternate form of evidence than protocol studies to support differences between
problem-solving and designing.
This paper has demonstrated, through a detailed analysis of EEG data, that a
low-cost EEG device can be used to produce preliminary results in design research,
results capable of being used to provide initial testing of hypotheses.

5.2. Limitations of the study
The data set is from a convenience sample of volunteers who responded to the call
for participants. The participants’ familiarity with layout tasks and their sketching
ability have the potential to influence the results. The statistical approach we
described reduced the potential effects on the results of the limitations of using a
low-cost EEG device. Due to the low spatial resolution of EEG the results cannot
support strong claims related to location, as fields extend across the brain (Sawyer,
2011). To better identify unique brain regions associated with neural activity a
larger number of EEG channels is needed or techniques that provide a higher
spatial resolution are required.

5.3. Further work
Analysis of the frequency bands and temporal analysis of the EEG data is in
progress to produce a more detailed articulation of the neurophysiological activations of these cohorts of mechanical engineers and industrial designers and to
relate them to published results (Nguyen & Zheng 2010; Vecchiato et al. 2015; Liu
et al. 2016; Liang et al. 2017).The results we already have allow for the comparison
between domains at multiple levels of details. These comparisons will be the subject
of a future paper. More data needs to be collected to understand the extent of EEG
data for design studies. Think-aloud protocols of individuals and design teams are
being collected separately while measuring EEG responses. Further research is
needed for the removal of artefacts due to speech and motor skeletal bursts without
removing signals that result from cognitive actions. If successful, the cleaned data

would allow for the direct temporal matching of design cognition, derived from
think-aloud protocol, with neurophysiological measurements, opening up a new
research direction for neurocognitive research in design studies.
More research connecting brain region activations and cognitive functions is
needed to make design neurocognition a research tool that supersedes such
cognitive research tools as protocol analysis.

Appendix B
To compare the Pow of mechanical engineers we performed an analysis by running
a 5  2  7 repeated-measurement ANOVA, with the within-subject factors task,
hemisphere and electrode. From the analysis of the 18 participants we found a
significant main effect of: hemisphere, F(1, 17) = 16.88, p ≤ 0.001, η2partial = 0.50;
and electrode, FGG(2.85, 48.44) = 3, p < 0.01, η2partial = .15 (corrected for Greenhouse–Geisser estimates of sphericity, ε = 0.89). The pairwise comparisons
revealed that Task 4 does not differs significantly from Task 1 (p = 0.11). In
addiction the pairwise comparisons revealed that some electrodes were significant
between Task 1 and Task 4, namely, in the left hemisphere electrode O1(p = 0.02)
and in the right hemisphere electrode FC6(p = 0.04).
To compare the Pow of industrial designers we performed an analysis by
running a 5  2  7 repeated-measurement ANOVA, with the within-subject
factors task, hemisphere and electrode. From the analysis of the 18 participants we
found a significant main effect of: task, F(4, 68) = 5.95, p < 0.001, η2partial = .26;
hemisphere, F(1, 17) = 43.25, p < 0.001, η2partial = 0.72; and electrode, F
(6, 102) = 4.51, p < 0.001, η2partial = 0.21. The pairwise comparisons revealed that
Task 4 differs significantly from Task 1 (p < 0.001). In addiction the pairwise
comparisons revealed that some electrodes were significant between Task 1 and
Task 4, namely, in the left hemisphere electrodes AF3 (p = 0.03), F3 (p = 0.03), P7
(p < 0.001) and O1 (p < 0.001) and in the right hemisphere electrodes FC6
(p = 0.03), P8 (p = 0.01) and O2 (p < 0.001).

To compare the Pow of industrial designers and mechanical engineers, we
performed an analysis by running a 2  5  2  7 mixed repeated-measurement
ANOVA, with the between-subjects factor domain and the within-subject factors
task, hemisphere and electrode. From the analysis of the 36 participants (18 industrial designers and 18 mechanical engineers) we found a significant main effect of:
task, FGG(3.03, 102.87) = 5.50, p < 0.01,η2partial = 0.14 (corrected for Greenhouse–
Geisser estimates of sphericity, ε = 0.76); hemisphere, F(1, 136) = 59.05,
p < 0.001,η2partial = 0.64 and for electrode, FGG(3.80, 129.35) = 6.49,
p < 0.001,η2partial = 0.16 (corrected for Greenhouse–Geisser estimates of sphericity,
ε = 0.63). Moreover, the ANOVA revealed a significant interaction effect between
the factors: domain and hemisphere, F(1, 136) = 5.92, p = 0.02,η2partial = 0.15; and
hemisphere and electrode, FGG(3.34, 113.56) = 4.36, p < 0.01,η2partial = 0.11 (corrected for Greenhouse–Geisser estimates of sphericity, ε = 0.56). In addition, we
conducted pairwise comparisons to check for differences between industrial
designers and mechanical engineers comparing the seven electrodes per hemisphere and task. Below we report on significant (p ≤ 0.05) comparisons. The
following comparisons were significant in the left hemisphere for Task 1, electrodes
P7(p = .03) and in the right hemisphere for Task 3, electrode FC6 (p = 0.03).

To compare the Pow scores for the deciles we performed an analysis by running a
5  2  7  10 repeated-measurement ANOVA, with the within-subject factors of
task, hemisphere, electrode and decile, per domain. From the analysis of
the 18 mechanical engineers we found a significant main effect of: task,
F(4, 68) = 2.95, p = 0.03, η2partial = 0.15; hemisphere, F(1, 17) = 48.64, p < 0.001,
η2partial = 0.74; electrode, F(6, 102) = 2.89, p = 0.01, η2partial = 0.15) and decile
FGG(4.29, 72.94) = 3.09, p = 0.02, η2partial = 0.15 (corrected for Greenhouse–Geisser
estimates of sphericity, ε = 0.48). Significant interaction effects were found between
the factors: hemisphere and electrode, FGG(6, 102) = 6.59, p < 0.001, η2partial = 0.27);
task and decile, F(36, 612) = 1.65, p = 0.01, η2partial = 0.09; electrode and decile, F
(54, 918) = 1.58, p < 0.01, η2partial = 0.09. In Table C1 we report on significant
(p ≤ .05) pairwise comparisons found between Task 1 and Task 4 (open free hand
sketching design) across the deciles.

Appendix D
To compare the Pow scores for the deciles of industrial designers and mechanical
engineers, we performed an analysis by running a 5  2  7  10 repeatedmeasurement ANOVA, with the between-subjects factor domain and the withinsubject factors of task, hemisphere, electrode and decile. From the analysis of the
36 participants (18 industrial designers and 18 mechanical engineers) we found a
significant main effect of: task, FGG(3.01, 102.41) = 7.07, p < 0.001, η2partial = 0.17
(corrected for Greenhouse–Geisser estimates of sphericity, ε = 0.75); hemisphere, F
(1, 34) = 134.64, p < 0.001, η2partial = 0.80; electrode, FGG(4.53, 153.88) = 6.06,
p < 0.001, η2partial = 0.15 (corrected for Greenhouse–Geisser estimates of sphericity,
ε = 0.75); and decile FGG(6.29, 213.79) = 2.91, p < 0.01, η2partial = 0.08 (corrected for
Greenhouse–Geisser estimates of sphericity, ε = 0.70). No significant main effect
was found for domain, F(1, 34) = 1.16, p = 0.29,η2partial = 0.03. Moreover, the
ANOVA revealed a significant interaction effect between the factors: task and
domain, F(4, 136) = 4.39, p < 0.01, η2partial = 0.11; task and electrode, FGG(9.02,
306.80) = 2.40, p = 0.01, η2partial = 0.07 (corrected for Greenhouse–Geisser
estimates of sphericity, ε = 0.38); task and decile, F(36, 1224) = 2.33, p < 0.001,
η2partial = 0.06; and hemisphere and electrode, F(6, 204) = 8.62, p < 0.001, η2partial = 0.20. No other significant main effect nor interaction effect between the factors
was found. There was no adjustment for multiple comparisons.
