Abstract: Knowledge of the mental workload induced by a Web page is essential for improving
users’ browsing experience. However, continuously assessing the mental workload during a
browsing task is challenging. To address this issue, this paper leverages the correlation between
stimuli and physiological responses, which are measured with high-frequency, non-invasive
psychophysiological sensors during very short span windows. An experiment was conducted
to identify levels of mental workload through the analysis of pupil dilation measured by
an eye-tracking sensor. In addition, a method was developed to classify mental workload
by appropriately combining different signals (electrodermal activity (EDA), electrocardiogram,
photoplethysmo-graphy (PPG), electroencephalogram (EEG), temperature and pupil dilation)
obtained with non-invasive psychophysiological sensors. The results show that the Web browsing
task involves four levels of mental workload. Also, by combining all the sensors, the efficiency of the
classification reaches 93.7%.

1. Introduction
Although Web applications are often justified in terms of increasing the productivity of human
tasks, they sometimes have the opposite effect, interrupting, reducing the performance of, or increasing
the mental workload of the user [1–4]. A typical task in which this phenomenon may occur is Web
browsing. In this task, the user fixes her/his gaze on and between Web elements, i.e., graphic or
textual areas of a Web page, such as news, commercial advertisements, and menus [5–7]. In cognitive
psychology and ergonomics, mental workload refers to the amount of perceived effort induced by a
particular task [8].
An important factor in measuring the effectiveness of a Web page is the user’s browsing experience.
It has been shown that the higher the level of user’s browsing experience is, the lower the mental
workload [3,4,9]. Continuously assessing the mental workload involved in browsing tasks entails
measuring it either when the user fixes her attention on a Web element or when her gaze switches
from one element to another. This assessment of mental workload can enhance the user’s browsing
experience in many ways: for instance, automatically identifying the most suitable moments to
proactively deliver content to the user or preventing irritating intrusions from the environment;
keeping the Web page support interventions on stand-by and adapting graphic user interfaces in
real time; and evaluating the likelihood of user’s abandonment, frustration or techno stress, among
other benefits. In addition, instantaneous classification of mental workload would make it possible to
detect short time windows of reduced cognitive burden to activate the delivery of different types of
recommendations in a timely, unobtrusive manner, such as contextual news in newspaper portals or

commercial advertisement pop-ups on various Web sites. In addition, it may be possible to enhance
search tasks, for instance, for restaurants, flight tickets, or retail products, by providing relevant
feedback to the search engine based on the user’s cognitive status [6].
To realize the above requirements, it is essential to address the challenge of automatically assessing
the mental workload in a continuous fashion while the user is engaged in browsing, that is, in real
time, with high frequency and using very short time windows.
Many studies have focused on classifying mental workload in general by capturing and processing
data using ever less invasive psychophysiological sensors [10–14]. This method is founded on the
empirical demonstration of the correlation existing between psychological stimuli and physiological
responses triggered by the nervous system. Moreover, mental workload has been shown to vary
frequently within a short time span [15,16].
Although considerable research has been devoted to assessing mental workload on the scale
of hours and minutes by using data extracted from psychophysiological sensors, less attention has
been paid to time windows lasting seconds or less, such as when a user fixes her gaze on a Web
element. Indeed, Bailey et al. [17] have recently proved that moments of reduced mental workload
occur while the user’s attention is transiting from one task to another. However, this was shown only
for coarse-grained tasks, such as selecting a travel route among alternatives presented in a graphic
interface or classifying a list of emails into various categories [17].
In this paper, the capabilities of psychophysiological sensors are leveraged to research the
possibility of assessing mental workload in real time during a browsing task. This paper thus attempts
to answer the following research questions:

•

•

RQ1: Is it possible to identify levels with regard to a user’s mental workload within very short
time windows (order of milliseconds) based on psychophysiological signals recorded during a
Web browsing task?
RQ2: Is it possible to accurately classify in real time a user’s mental workload, both when her
gaze is fixed on a Web element and when her gaze is transiting from one Web element to another,
by combining different non-invasive psychophysiological sensors?

In addition, based on the findings of Bailey et al. [17], this paper attempts to prove the following
hypothesis:

•

H1: Mental workload is significantly smaller when the user’s attention is switching from one Web element
to another than when she is focused on a Web element.

To answer these research questions and prove the stated hypothesis, an experiment was conducted
in which 61 users performed a normal Web browsing task in front of a computer screen while
their psychophysiological responses were measured by different sensors and recorded in a database.
The gold standard with regard to answering RQ1 is pupil diameter because several previous studies
have shown that, under controlled illumination conditions, this psychophysiological response is a
valid and reliable indicator of mental workload [17–23]. Using clustering methods, this paper shows
that, by processing the pupil dilation response, four levels of mental workload can be identified.
However, measuring pupil dilation with an eye tracker is not a realistic and practical method to
classify mental workload, for example, in the open air, because it requires constant and controlled
illumination conditions. Thus, in this paper, more practical and less invasive sensors are assessed to
measure other psychophysiological responses, such as heart rate (HR), electrodermal activity (EDA),
body temperature, and electrocardiogram (ECG). The electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor is also
assessed because there have been important advances in the construction of portable EEGs and in
algorithms to reduce motion-related artifacts [24,25]. It is expected that before long, there will be EEG
devices that only capture brain waves from the areas of the brain relevant to the assessment of mental
workload, making them less invasive [26].

This paper shows that, using all the sensors and efficiently processing their signals using a
multi-layer perceptron, among other models, mental workload can be classified as proposed in RQ2.
Furthermore, the hypothesis that mental workload is significantly smaller when the user’s attention is
switching from one Web element to another than when she is focused on a Web element is confirmed.
The contributions of this paper include: (i) identifying the different levels of mental workload
required for Web browsing through the processing and analysis of pupil dilation measured
by an eye-tracking sensor; (ii) developing a method for appropriately combining non-invasive
psychophysiological sensors to classify real-time mental workload in small time windows with high
accuracy based on the behavior of the user’s gaze in a Web browsing task; and (iii) leaving open
the possibility of using gaze shifts from one Web element to another as the most appropriate time to
provide the user with recommendations, for example.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the background required to understand this
research. Section 3 presents the related literature. The experiment conducted is described in Section 4,
as well as the data processing and the machine learning methods applied to the data. The results are
presented in Section 5 and are discussed in Section 6, while Section 7 concludes the paper.
2. Background
2.1. Assessment Methods
Cognitive resources are assets used by cognition to think, remember, make decisions, solve
problems, or coordinate movements, such as perception, attention, short- and long-term memory,
and motor control [27,28]. According to Navon et al. [29], these resources underlying human learning
and information processing are limited [30].
Wickens [8], in his multiple resource theory, suggests that these resources can be used in parallel
for multiple tasks, using several resources at once. However, when task demand is high, the resources
allocated to that task are not available for another task if the same mental resources are required at the
same stage of processing. Excessive use, moreover, can cause a state of overload known as cognitive
resource depletion [31]. This overload means that the brain is unable to process new information,
resulting in processing and/or execution errors [32].
Mental workload results from the different levels of resource demand, depending on the parallel
tasks that the person is performing [8,15,16,33]. Excessive resource demand can cause distraction,
increase errors, generate stress and frustration, and reduce the ability to undertake mental planning,
problem solving, or decision-making [34,35]. One example is the distraction caused by unwelcome
advertisements on a Web page while the user is browsing. In this case, the intermingling of the
browsing task with the intrusion of commercial advertisements forces the user to divide attention and
allocate cognitive resources to the new stimulus.
Traditionally, mental workload has been assessed in different situations using subjective
methods [10] based on surveys, auto-perception scales, or think-aloud protocols [36–38]. These methods
are applied after the user has already finished the task, and the assessment of the mental workload
depends of the user’s final perception [39]. Therefore, these methods are constrained by the reporting
bias introduced by relying on past memories and by the problem of ecological validity based on
observing responses to hypothetical scenarios rather than behaviors in a real setting [40]. In addition,
the static nature of these methods makes them unfit for real-time evaluation. The most widespread
example of this method is the NASA Task Load Index, which measures the mental and physical
performance, as well as the effort and frustration, of the user [41].
Performance-based methods have also been used, which measure indicators generated during
task execution, such as the percentage of correct responses or execution time [3,10,11]. In this method,
the user needs to be engaged in only one task. Its major restriction is the difficulty of assessing mental
workload in near real time.

Sensors 2018, 18, 458

The attempts to find objective indicators to measure mental workload in real time are based
on collecting contextual information, which can be captured mainly using psychophysiological
sensors [42–44]. Indeed, there is ample empirical evidence in psychophysiology showing that some
physiological responses are directly related to psychological factors such as stress, mental workload,
and emotions [45–47]. That is, there is a correlation between the physiological responses triggered by
the nervous system and psychological stimuli.
Psychophysiological responses are controlled by the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which
regulates and coordinates bodily processes such as digestion, temperature, blood pressure, and many
aspects of emotional behavior [48]. These actions occur independently of the conscious control of the
individual. The ANS includes the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous
system (PNS). The SNS controls actions required in emergency situations, such as stress and movement.
It can cause heart rate acceleration, pupil dilation, and increased blood flow to the muscles, sweating,
and muscle tension. The PNS controls the functions related to rest, repair, and relaxation of the body.
The responses elicited by this system include a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure, stimulation
of the digestive system, and pupillary contraction, among others [45,46].
2.2. Psychophysiological Measurements
There are different types of methods to measure psychophysiological responses elicited
complementarily by the SNS and PNS [49]. For instance, the device for tracking gaze is the eye
tracker. It consists of a camera typically positioned below the computer screen that works according
to the “corneal-reflection/pupil-center” method, which consists of recording the centre of the pupil
to identify the gaze position and recording the reflection of infrared lights [50]. It also allows the
measurement of the variation of the pupil diameter. Pupillography measures changes in pupil size,
which can be attributed to both parasympathetic inhibition, which explains the first dilation phase,
and sympathetic activation, which explains the subsequent contraction phase [51,52]. Although pupil
dilation can be triggered by a light reflex caused by changes in environment illumination or by a
proximity or accommodation reflex to improve visual focus, it can also be caused by a psychosensory
reflex associated with the cognitive or emotional engagement of the person while exposed to any
sensory stimulus [53]. In contrast to changes in the two previous reflexes, changes in pupil size in this
case are subtler, so a high-precision device or eye tracker is required for their detection [54].
Nevertheless, some shortcomings with pupillometrics need to be taken into account. For instance,
response delays can reach up to 1000 ms, which may invalidate the work with short time windows;
pupil variations can be due to multiple factors, such as exhaustion, stimulants and gaze shifts, among
others. The eye tracker is also used for tracking the eye to determine gaze position or movements
within a scene, including two relevant measurements:

•

•

Fixations: moments during which the gaze is relatively fixed or focused. They occur because
sharp vision is only possible within a small area in the human eye called the fovea. It is useful to
determine when eye fixation occurs because, in most cases, it coincides with attention.
Saccades: rapid eye movements or jumps from one fixation point to another. Saccades follow a
pattern (or trajectory) depending on several factors: what is currently being looked at, visual
target tracking, experience, and emotions.

Another set of psychophysiological measurements is obtained by electroencephalography. This is
based on recording the electrical activity of the brain measured on the scalp. The device used is the
EEG, which measures the voltage resulting from changes in ionic current flow within the neurons of
the brain, produced by the brain’s synaptic activity. The EEG signal is a blend of different subjacent
frequencies, which represents different cognitive or affective states. For its capture, it is used, among
others, the 10–20 distribution of electrodes located on the skull (see Figure 1). Each electrode is named
with a letter and a number. The first refers to a specific region of the brain—frontal lobe (F), temporal

it represents the right side, if odd, the left side.
There are five major brain waves: delta (1–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), beta (12–25 Hz),

decay of the signal changes constantly within the same subject, depending on its hydration, dry skin or
autonomic regulation. This component can differ highly between subjects. The phasic component or
conductive response of the skin is above the tonic component and shows significantly faster alterations.
The signal is sensitive to specific emotional stimulus events, which induce peaks that occur between
1–5 s after the start of the stimulus.
The cardiovascular system is particularly interesting for psychophysiology because it is highly
sensitive to neurological processes and psychological factors such as stress. It is regulated by the
ANS, which produces patterns of electrical activity that are fundamental for psychophysiological
measurements [45]. Several studies associate changes in cardiac activity with psychological phenomena,
such as mental work, perception, attention, problem solving, and signal detection [63].
An ECG is used to measure the electrical activity of the heart, using at least three electrodes
attached to the chest. The electrodes collect the necessary data with regard to the electric waves that
describe the cardiac cycle, based on which the HR or its variation (HRV) are obtained.
The human body constantly exchanges heat with the environment as part of the process of
self-regulation to maintain homeostasis (internal balance of the body). Body temperature increases and
decreases in relation to the energy exchanged. The regulation of blood flow to the skin and thermal
radiation is considered a function of the ANS [64]. Studies conducted in this field, according to Genno
et al. (1997) [65], suggest that skin temperature has potential as a psychophysiological measure of
the individual.
3. Literature Review
This paper focuses on the measurement of mental workload while the user browses a Web site
in front of his or her personal computer. The literature in this regard is scant. Thus, to start studying
the measurement of mental workloads in various domains and to help understand the methodology
associated with this type of research, this section focuses on two main points: the assessment of mental
workload using psychophysiological sensors in general and the measurement of mental workload in
Web environments.
3.1. Assessment of Mental Workload with Psychophysiological Sensors
A relevant study for this paper is that by Bailey et al. [17] who develop psychophysiological
measures to assess the effect of interruptions on the performance of a person executing a task.
They establish that interruption involves considerable negative effects, such as increased time to
complete the task [35], a wider range of errors [66], additional efforts in decision-making [67] and
mood changes such as increased frustration and anxiety [68–70]. For example, when an interruption
occurs at a random time while performing a major task, the time to completion can increase by up
to 30%, up to twice as many errors can be committed, and user displeasure doubles, in contrast to
when the interruption occurs at a pre-programmed time. Therefore, Bailey et al. empirically find that
interruptions may have a lower cost if they occur at a time of low mental workload, hypothesizing
that this may occur at the boundaries between subtasks when executing the general task [71]. As a
test method, they assess mental workload by pupil dilation in three different tasks that include
respective subtasks. The first task consists of assessing two different routes between two cities on a
monitor; the user must measure the distance and cost of the routes, tabulate the data, and, finally,
discriminate and choose the shortest and most economical route. In the second task, the user must
edit a document and correct spelling at three levels of complexity (editing a word, editing two words,
and editing a complete sentence). The third task entails classifying nine emails involving explicit
issues (low complexity) and ambiguous issues (high complexity) into four categories. Each of these
scenarios is applied to 24 people (seven women) between 19 and 50 years of age. The main conclusions
of the study are as follows: (i) mental workload varies during the execution of the three tasks, (ii) the
mental workload decreases when performing subtasks compared to the general task, and (iii) different
subtasks demand different levels of mental workload based on their complexity.

Sensors 2018, 18, 458

Other studies focus on training classifiers to process psychophysiological signal data in a time
window in order to predict whether the load associated with a specific task is high or low [72].
For example, Haapalainen et al. [11] measure the mental workloads of basic tasks such as the resolution
of problems on a monitor, visual perception, and cognitive speed by using an eye-tracking device,
EEG, ECG, heat flow, and rate measurements. As a result, they find that ECG and heat flow together
distinguish between tasks of high and low cognitive demand with 80% precision.
Fritz et al. [10] seek to verify whether psychophysiological sensors are useful in measuring
the difficulty of a computer code comprehension task with various levels of difficulty. The tasks
are performed by software developers, who are monitored using an eye tracker and an
electroencephalogram. Fritz et al. use the Beta/( Al pha + Theta) ratio based on the evidence that
beta increases with task execution, theta is deleted, and alpha is blocked. The models obtained classify
task difficulty with 85% accuracy.
Shi et al. [73] assess stress and arousal levels by measuring EDA for increasing levels of difficulty.
The experiment consists of a transition interface in which the participants must respond to the
requirements in three scenarios: (1) using gestures and speaking, (2) only speaking, and (3) only
using gestures. The difficulty varies depending on level of visual complexity, number of entities,
number of distractors, time limit, and number of actions to complete. The results indicate that there is
a significant increase in the EDA signal as task difficulty increases.
Nourbakhsh et al. [74] confirm the effectiveness of EDA in discriminating between the difficulty
of eight arithmetic tasks with four levels of difficulty. In addition, as an extension of the previous
study, Nourbakhsh et al. measure mental workload using EDA changes and the number of blinks
obtained from an eye-tracking device. The experiment is the same as in the previous study. This time,
by combining both sensors, 75% precision is achieved for the lowest level of difficulty.
Xu et al. [75] show that mental workload can be measured by pupil dilation if illumination
changes. The experiment consists of arithmetic tasks that vary in difficulty depending on the number
of digits.
In Ikehara et al. [12], an eye-tracking device, a pressure sensor for the mouse, an EDA sensor,
and a pulse oximeter (for measuring HR and level of oxygen in the blood) are used. The experiment
consists of selecting on a screen the fractions whose value is less than 1/3. There are two levels
of difficulty in the experiment. The results indicate that EDA and pupil dilation have the greatest
statistical significance in terms of detecting task difficulty.
Using an elastic neural network, Hogervost et al. [13] find that the best performance is obtained
when EEG is combined with pupil dilation (91% accuracy) and when EEG is combined with peripheral
physiology (89%); with EEG alone, they obtain 86% accuracy. In addition, using only the measurement
of the electrode located in the Pz position (central parietal area of the head), they obtain 88% accuracy.
3.2. Assessment of Mental Workload in Web Environments
Although the study of users’ cognitive responses during Web browsing is an intriguing area,
it remains little explored. Indeed, one of the few studies on the topic is that by Albers [3], who examines
how mental workload theory applies to the design of Web sites using the tapping test method, which
measures mental workload by focusing on performance. As in all the examples using this approach,
the tapping test adds an additional secondary task to the main one, measuring the performance of
the participant to determine the level of mental workload induced. In this case, the main task is
to browse two Web sites sequentially—with implicit mental workload controlled by design—and
answer questions aloud in relation to the Web pages, while the secondary task is to rhythmically keep
tapping per second. As mental workload increases, tapping begins to fall slowly and lose the rhythm,
even losing it completely when there is cognitive overload. However, implementing a secondary task
as required by this method prevents from generating a realistic scenario for the user and does not
allow real-time measurement.

The most recent research regarding the observation of Web users’ experience involves the
measurement of their behavior as a reaction to different stimuli, such as notifications, and allows us
to predict the user’s response according to Navalpakkam and Churchill [76]. By comparing mouse
pointer movement to eye tracking, they are able to determine a more user-friendly layout for a Web
site, which improves the effectiveness of the notification. Finally, they conclude that gaze and mouse
movement patterns contain important information in terms of assessing the user’s status, determining
if they are distracted from the assigned task or striving to fulfill it. The correlation between eye
movements and mouse pointer movement predicts a Web user’s different psycho-emotional states.
They also conclude that the user is more likely to pay attention to notifications when they vary in
position on the Web site rather than when they are fixed.
Table 1 summarizes the discussion of the literature by assessing to what extent each related
work encompasses the major concerns of this paper: (1) capacity to assess mental workload
during very short time windows; (2) capacity to provide mental workload classification results
near to real-time measurement; (3) evaluation based on Web browsing tasks and (4) use of multiple
psychophysiological sensors.
As conclusion, the measurement of mental workload using psychophysiological signals has been
tested for a varied set of tasks. In addition, studies have investigated how mental workload is related
to the design of a Web page. However, the above mentioned research provides no evidence regarding
assessment of mental workload while browsing a Web site using multiple psychophysiological
measures. There is also no reference to time overhead to determine how feasible it is to implement
near real-time measurement.

values of the pixels was calculated and divided by 255, thus obtaining the percentage of brightness in
the image of each frame. Figure 4 shows the percentage of brightness in each frame. The initial fall

To discriminate between types of windows, the data file exported from the Tobii Studio program
generates a column showing the AoI that the participant is inspecting for each sample. It discriminates
between three values: when the user is not looking at the screen—inactive—, when the user is looking
at a certain AoI—active window, and when the user’s gaze is directed outside the AoI—which is
considered a transition window.
A long minimum time of 500 ms is set to define a valid time window. This is based on the
research of Loyola et al. [89], who assesses the identification of key Web elements in a Web site using
eye tracking. This time span is selected to avoid possible contamination of the pupil signal by the
analysis of a previous object. Time windows below the threshold are not considered for analysis and
are therefore deleted. When the same Web element is analyzed before and after a deleted window,
the two segments are joined, generating a window of greater length.
4.5.2. Data Preprocessing
The data exported from Tobii Studio contains the diameter of the left pupil, the diameter of the
right pupil (both in millimeters), and the validation of the reliability of the capture of each pupil
between 0—high reliability—and four—the eye was not detected. On average for all participants and
considering only valid windows, the reliability of the capture of the left pupil is 0.2469, and that of the
right pupil is 0.22036; these are reliable values to validate the capture of pupil diameter data. As these
values are an average for all the participants, the pupil data with the highest level of reliability are
selected for each sample [10].
Next, signal distortion artifacts, such as saccades and blinks, are eliminated. A column in the
extracted data shows if the sample is a fixation or a saccade, and this information is used to filter
saccades. Furthermore, a linear interpolation between the values of the blinks detected is used.
In addition, a Blackman window with a cut-off frequency of 2 Hz is applied as a low-pass filter.
Normalization of the pupil signal is performed using the baseline value obtained from the average
calculation of the pupil area 500 ms before subjecting the participant to the stimulus. To calculate the
area it is assumed that the pupil is a circumference. Then, the base area is subtracted from the area of
the signal during the experiment to calculate the dilation or constriction of the pupil [90]. The z-score is
applied to the resulting signal in order to normalize the data and allow comparison between subjects.
In the same way, the baseline is calculated for all other signals considering the 500 ms prior to the
stimulus and subtracting the baseline average from the experimental signal. Z-score is also applied in
order to compare signals between subjects. Then, each signal is processed as explained below.
EDA raw data provides the values of electric resistance of the skin in kilohms [kΩ]. To reduce
noise and eliminate motion artifacts, two procedures are performed: first, a strict instruction is given
to each participant not to move the hand or fingers where the electrodes are attached, and second,
the signal is filtered with a low-pass cut-off frequency of 5 Hz. Furthermore, on the recommendation
of the literature [91], capture resolution is reduced without risk of data loss. The EDA signal measured
with a sampling frequency of 120 Hz is reduced to 10 samples per second. The phasic component
is extracted by applying a median filter with a window width of ±4 and subtracting the average of
the current sample [91]. This component allows the detection of peaks of the EDA signal. With slow
transitions, the phasic component does not show major variations.
Regarding the electrocardiogram, the raw data yield values that must be transformed to millivolts
[mV]. The processing of this signal consists of using a low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 100 Hz
and applying the fast Fourier transform to obtain the characteristic shape.
The raw data of the PPG yield signal values in millivolts [mV]. From this signal, it is possible
to obtain the HR. Previously, the PPG signal is processed using a low-pass filter with a cut-off
frequency of 16 Hz with a Blackman window, obtaining a cleaner signal. Then, HR is obtained via the
following steps: first, the peaks must be found; second, the time between them is substracted (∆t in
[miliseconds/pulse]); third, they are converted from hundredths to seconds and from [seconds/pulse]

Sensors 2018, 18, 458

to [pulses/second], which is then multiplied by 60 to convert to [beats/minute]. This is resume in the
Equation (1):

∆t · 100 minute
The raw data yield body temperature values in degrees Celsius. The processing of this signal
consists of using a low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 1 Hz, as concluded based on the data
collection in Haapalainen et al. [11].
The EEG signal is subject to a wide variety of artifacts and noise [92,93]. Among the elements
that cause artifacts are blinking, oculomotor activity, head movements, facial expressions that add
noise due to the muscle electrical signal, and movement of the electrodes, among others. To eliminate
the effect of head swinging, a high-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 0.5 Hz is used. In addition,
a low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 40 Hz is used to eliminate noise from the electrical grid
(50–60 Hz). To eliminate outliers and decrease the effect of the blinking artifact a Hampel filter is
used [94].
4.5.3. Feature Extraction
Feature extraction is performed based on time windows. Since signals have different scales, to be
comparable objects, it is necessary to standardize them before extracting characteristics from them,
as proposed by Guyon et al. [95]. To perform standardization, the classical ( x − µ)/σ form is used,
where x is the vector corresponding to the signal, and µ and σ are the mean and the standard deviation
of the signal, respectively.
A total of 44 characteristics pertaining to the different signals are extracted: two from pupil
dilation, six from EDA, two from body temperature, three from ECG, three from PPG-HR, and two
from each of the 14 EEG channels. Table 2 shows a summary of the characteristics, following which
the obtained characteristics are presented in more detail.

Because it has been proven that pupillary response is an important indicator of the mental effort
required to solve a task, it is selected as the gold standard by which to cluster windows and generate
labels for cognitive levels. There are clustering cases in the literature regarding the development of
Web tasks such as the study of Loyola et al. [89]. The selected characteristics are the mean and variance
of the pupil diameter of the eye that displays greater reliability in its measurement.
Based on the findings of Nourbakhsh [74] and Shi et al. [73], the following characteristics are
extracted from the processed EDA signal: accumulated normalized data, mean as a function of
normalized time, and spectral power without normalized continuous component. Equation (2) shows
the calculation of the normalized EDA signal. Each point in time t is added, where i corresponds to
the participant, k and m is the total number of tasks; m = 3 in this case:

Therefore, the data for each participant are normalized by dividing the task signal by the mean
value of all the tasks for the subject. Then, the accumulated EDA characteristics are calculated as
shown in Equation (3) and mean EDA is calculated according to Equation (4), where T is the total time
for all the tasks:

The following characteristics are extracted from the phasic component obtained: number of peaks,
maximum modulus, and average of the phasic component of the window [10].
Based on the proposal by Haapalainen et al. [11], the following characteristics are selected for
the ECG signal: median, mean, and variance of the ECG median absolute deviation (ECG_MAD),
calculated using Equation (5):
ECG_MAD = |ECGi − median(ECG)|

(5)

The characteristics of the heart rate obtained from the PPG signal are selected based on the
time domain characteristics used in Betella [96]. These are the mean, standard deviation, and root
mean square of HR. Based on the proposal by Haapalainen et al. [11], the median and mean of the
temperature are selected.
For the EEG signal, there are two main approaches: event-related potential (ERP) analysis
and time-frequency signal analysis. The latter is selected because it is more closely related to the
psychophysiological and structural processes of the brain [92]. It is used to study emotional-cognitive
states in particular and is more advisable when studying a limited period or a relatively low amount of
data, as is the case of the time-window study of this paper [97]. Among the different ways of analyzing
the EEG signal in time-frequency are frequency bands with Fourier transform, Morlet wavelets,
and Hilbert transform. All three show similar results according to Cohen [98]. Thus, the option of the
Hilbert Transform (H{eeg}(t)) is selected, which has the advantage of greater control over frequency
filtering. The Equation (6) shows this transform:
ˆ = H{eeg}(t) = (h ∗ eeg)(t) =
eeg

ˆ is the resulting analytic signal. Before applying this
where h(t) = 1/πt, eeg is the EEG signal and eeg
transform, a bandpass filter between 2 and 15 Hz is used to center the study in the theta (4–8 Hz)
and alpha (8–12 Hz) frequency bands. These are related to states of mental activity and relaxation,
respectively, where theta increases and alpha is suppressed when there is mental workload [97].
A complex signal called the “analytical signal” is then obtained, from which two characteristics are
extracted. This is performed for each of the 14 channels of the EEG signal.
4.5.4. Clustering
Clustering is performed for all participants to determine how many levels of mental workload the
users present based on the measurement of pupil diameter. The database is labeled after ascertaining
these levels. The pupil diameter data is used after the baseline correction and, as mentioned previously,
the z-score standardization is performed with the aim of including all the participants in the analysis,
establishing the cluster boundaries for all of them. In Loyola et al. [89], the k-means method is used.
Because an overestimation or underestimation of the number K of clusters affects the quality
of the cluster, the optimal value of clusters is sought. The K value is tested from two onwards to
obtain two curves. The index of Calinski and Harabasz (CH) and the internal measure of cohesion of
the sum of the squares within the group (WSS) are selected to this end [99–101]. The stop rule is the

Sensors 2018, 18, 458

value closest to the point where the curves intersect. Figure 6 shows the curves obtained through this
methodology, where the optimal value is generated at K = 4. Visually, the grouping can be validated
considering

The Jaccard coefficient obtained using the bootstrap method is used as an external criterion
for validating clusters, which assesses how stable the cluster is [99,100]. Values between 0.6 and
0.75 indicate that the group is measuring a pattern in the data, but there is no certainty as to which
points should be grouped. Groups with stability values above approximately 0.85 can be considered
highly stable.
For this study, the bootstrap method confirms that K = 4 is the optimal value since Jaccard
coefficients are the best compared to other cluster numbers. The Jaccard indices are 0.79 (cluster 1),
0.72 (cluster 2), 0.75 (cluster 3) and 0.88 (cluster 4). Considering all the valid participants, this result
shows that there are four levels of mental workload validated with acceptable cohesion indices (RQ1).
4.5.5. Feature Selection and Applied Machine Learning Models
A Feature Selection is performed in order to improve the efficiency and time costs of the
classification. There is evidence in the literature regarding the use of the random forest and recursive
feature elimination (RF-RFE) method for the selection of characteristics with good results when applied
to the classification of mental workload with EEG signals [102]. This combines recursive elimination
with random forest, that is, a set of decision trees that assesses features and generates a ranking
following a score criterion. This method is executed with all the features extracted from signals with
the clustered data for all the participants. Table 3 shows the subset of features selected.

To perform the classification, a training set is first generated with 70% of the observations and
then a test set with the remaining 30%. To avoid biases, a 10-fold cross validation is performed in
which the classes are distributed uniformly within each set. In addition, they are randomly selected
while maintaining the proportions.
Three classification models are applied: Multinomial Logistic Regression (m-LR), Multi-class
Support Vector Machine (m-SVM) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Since the applied normalization
validates a between-subject analysis, each classification result is obtained from the average resulting
from executing each classification model 100 times.
As an initial approach using the dataset in a classification problem, we perform a m-LR and
am-SVM, since there are four classes of cognitive workload to classify. Binary logistic regression
and support vector machine are commonly used in classification problems and, in particular, both
have been used in previous studies with psychophysiological sensors. For instance, Fritz et al. [10]
apply and SVM algorithm to classify cognitive workload using EEG, EDA and pupil dilation. For an
independent variable with more factors, m-LR and m-SVM are less common approaches in the field.
In particular, for m-LR we use a Softmax function with four outcomes and for m-SVM we implement
an algorithm that build a classifier and compares it against the rest iteratively and choose the class
with the greatest margin.
Finally, we implement a MLP that uses as input all the features extracted from the signals without
the need to use the RF-RFE algorithm. The programmed MLP has two hidden layers with 1000 neurons

Sensors 2018, 18, 458

18 of 26

each and 500 epochs, with a rectified linear activation function, as used by Hinton [103]. The key,
according to Hinton, to avoid overfitting is to include a 50% dropout for each layer, which prevents
artificial neurons from co-adapting to training data.
Thus, each neuron in the hidden layers is omitted at random from the network with a probability
of 0.5. In addition, another method added to avoid model overfitting is the L1 and L2 regularization
method as a linear combination, as shown in Equation (7). For this, the objective function for the
artificial neural network is defined as L(W, B| j), where W represents the weight matrix and B the
column of bias vectors for each training example.
L0 (W, B| j) = L(W, B| j) + λ1 R1 (W, B| j) + λ2 R2 (W, B| j)

(7)

where the values of λ1 and λ2 are parameters that weight the relative contribution of the penalty terms
R1 and R2 (rule L1 and L2 , respectively) in relation to the objective function L(W, B| j). The values of
λ1 = 10−5 and λ2 = 10−5 are determined as recommended in the H20 manual [104].
5. Results
5.1. Statistical Analysis
The hypothesis that there is a decrease in mental workload in the transition time windows between
the analysis time windows of one Web element and another is proposed. To verify the hypothesis,
the mean pupil diameter within each window is selected as our gold standard. The objective is to
determine if the mean pupil diameter varies depending on whether it is in an active window or in a
transition object. An analysis of variance with repeated measures (ANOVA-RM) is performed since all
participants perform every task of the experiment. For the analysis, the complete universe of windows
of all the participants is considered.
As a result, a p-value = 0.00963 is obtained with a 95% confidence interval, so the null hypothesis
is rejected. In addition, as shown in Table 4, mean pupil diameter in the transition windows is smaller
than in the active windows. Therefore, it is concluded for the data as a whole that the difference
between mean pupil diameter in the active windows and the transition windows is statistically
significant and that the diameter is smaller in the transition windows (H1).

Baseline Statistical Analysis
In order to verify if the baseline correction performed in the pupil diameter is accurate for each
participant, it is necessary to evaluate if there exists a significant difference between the original pupil
diameter data and the baseline corrected pupil diameter data. With that aim, we perform a Shapiro test
for each participant to verify normality. For each one of the participants the null hypothesis is rejected,
which implies that it is necessary to apply a test for a generic distribution. Therefore, we apply the
non-parametric Wilcoxon test for each participant. The null hypothesis tested is that the means of
the original data and the baseline corrected data are the same. As a result, for all participants (except
participant 50, which is eliminated), the null hypothesis is rejected which implies that the means of
both are distinct. Then, our manipulation is valid.
5.2. Classification
In Table 5 we show the results using the three classifiers (m-LR, m-SVM and MLP) using all
the features extracted from signals and m-SVM using the selected features from RF-RFE algorithm.

Sensors 2018, 18, 458

The evaluation metrics that we present are accuracy, recall and precision. Also we calculate the Kappa
statistic to compare the expected results with the results of each model. Kappa statistic compares the
observed accuracy, number of instances correctly classified in the confusion matrix through the used
classifier, with the expected accuracy, accuracy that any random classifier would get using the number
of elements that belong to each class. This statistic is especially useful to conclude if the imbalance of
classes produce a bias classification and therefore, metrics like the accuracy would be distorted.

The worst results are given by the m-LR model with 51.42% of accuracy and a Kappa statistic
value of 5.92%. This result indicates that the model only tries to classify one class, so the difference
between the observed and expected accuracy is large.
Next, the m-SVM model has better evaluation metrics with 66.48% of accuracy using all the
features extracted from signals and 70.03% using only the subset of features from the RF-RFE algorithm.
In these cases, recall and precision are similar to the accuracy and also the Kappa statistic, which
implies that the imbalance of classes has a minor impact.
The results are notoriously improved using the MLP classifier, with an accuracy of 93.7% for all
the participants, 95.28% and 92.06% of recall and precision respectively. Kappa statistic is also an
excellent metric in this case, with a value of 91.24%. In this case, the imbalance of clusters has a minor
impact as well.
5.3. Evaluating Psychophysiological Sensors
To assess the performance of each sensor, the MLP that obtains the best results with all the sensors
is selected as a supervised learning model. Table 6 shows the results of assessing the performance
of each sensor separately. The sensor with the best performance is EEG, with 70.91% accuracy in the
classification. The other sensors separately have a very low level of classification accuracy.

Combinations of the three sensors with higher performance are tested: EEG, EDA, and PPG (HR).
As shown in Table 6, the combinations with EEG provide the best results. The combination with the
highest performance is EDA, PPG (HR), and EEG, with 86.27%.
An important difference between the EEG sensor and the others is that it allows the extraction of
a greater number of characteristics because the 14 electrodes contribute two characteristics each, for a

Sensors 2018, 18, 458

20 of 26

total of 28 characteristics. This factor may explain the superior performance of this sensor compared
to the rest. Therefore, it is concluded that it is possible to obtain good classification results for this
experimental design with less than five sensors, even only with the EEG (RQ2). The temperature
sensor and the ECG can thus be discarded.
5.4. Evaluating Time Overhead
For mental workload classification in a Web browsing task to lead to a real application, processing
must be sufficiently fast, given that the time windows considered have a minimum length of 500 ms.
Table 7 shows the classification time for each model that yielded the best results.

6. Discussion
The results of the statistical analysis determine that pupil diameter in the transition time windows
is statistically and significantly lower than in the active windows. Given the correlation between
pupil dilation and mental workload broadly accepted in the literature, it is determined that there is
a decrease in mental workload in the time windows between the analysis of one Web element and
another (H1).
A possible application of the H1 validation is the generation of recommendation systems
that support the user during Web browsing according to her interest, that is, when she is not
cognitively overloaded. This is applicable, for example, to retail applications, advertisement or
even productivity applications.
Regarding the assessment of the psychophysiological sensors to estimate mental workload during
a Web browsing task, with the exception of the EEG, the signals of the sensors used do not provide an
appropriate level of classification by themselves. This finding is aligned with what has been found in
the literature about mental workload assessment by using psychophysiological sensors, although in
different domains. We are unaware of any studies that provide the answer to this issue. Nevertheless,
the combinations of signals with the EEG signals stand out, obtaining high performance results.
It is necessary to remark the importance of the normalization of all participants’ signals through
their respective baseline. This allows us to perform a statistical analysis and to apply clustering and
classification models to all the participants in the study, minimizing the different measures within the
subjects due to the variance of biological conditions. In the best scenario, classifiers perform with very
high accuracy, precision, recall and kappa statistics in comparison with previous studies in the field.
This result may open the opportunity of applying psychophysiological signals in several domains with
accurate results.
In addition to these results, the experimental design is a contribution to the field since the task was
designed with the aim of taking one more step to bring it closer to real situations and thus, approach
to future applications. Previous studies structure the entire flow of a task by determining the input
and output of the same, which is a situation that lacks ecological validity and is not applicable to
reality. Further, as those tasks are highly structured, in past studies it is possible to apply subjective

Sensors 2018, 18, 458

21 of 26

tests to assess cognitive workload as an alternative measure of it. In this study, in which the task is
designed more dynamically it is not possible to apply this type of separated assessments since subjects
are biased with tasks occurred prior to the actual one, so the answers are not accurate. One of the
limitations of this work is not having labeled Web elements in the Web page, where each label had been
identified in advance. As future work, it is necessary to improve this method for mental workload
evaluation during Web browsing tasks, with the aim of having a separated measure to ensure that
mental workload is really being measured with the analysis of psychophysiological signals.
As shown in Section 4.3, one of the aims of the task design was to control external factors that
could affect the cognitive workload assessment. The main emphasis is given in known factors such as
brightness, changes in luminance and arousal. In particular, conditions like brightness and luminance
changes are well controlled due to the experimental room specially conditioned for this purpose. Also,
the task and the experimenter behavior are designed to focus on mental workload, avoiding another
physical or psychological responses. It was shown that these external factors do not have impact in
pupil dilation. Despite this fact, we think that in future studies, more work has to be done in this
aspect in order to accurately evaluate the experimental design.
7. Conclusions
The study of human behavior and physiology when performing human-computer interactions
activities is complex due to the multiple factors that affect each person in their performance and
behavior with regard to this class of tasks. This paper assesses the behavior of a user in the
simple task of browsing through a fictitious Web page created specifically for this study, using
psychophysiological sensors.
It is shown that for the complete data set, that is, considering the complete universe of windows
of all the participants, pupil diameter—as a measure of mental workload—is significantly lower in the
transition windows than in the active windows. Therefore, patterns of low mental workload states
are identified, and the hypothesis (H1) that it is indeed possible to measure mental workload in Web
browsing activities and, moreover, that the mental workload of the user decreases in the transition
from the analysis of one Web element to another while browsing is verified.
The unsupervised model of k-means analysis is applied to the mean of pupil dilation, based on
which the Web browsing task involves four levels of mental workload. Thus, it is concluded that there
are several mental workload states that can be determined (RQ1).
To classify levels of mental workload, three different models are used—m-LR, m-SVM and
MLP—(RQ2). Among the multiple obtained results, it is worth noting that if the EEG is combined with
the PPG and EDA, the kappa statistic of the classification reaches 80.72%. By using all the sensors this
performance raises to 91.24% (RQ2).
In terms of future lines of research, it is proposed to use the data to study Web users’ mood
behavior together with their cognitive behavior. In addition, it is proposed to focus the research on the
EEG sensor, which showed superior performance, using other analytical approaches, such as wavelets
and/or ERP, to determine the most relevant involved brain areas. In addition, we aim to improve the
experiment design by defining browsing tasks with different levels of difficulty.
