Introduction
The “do-it-yourself” (DIY) brain stimulation movement began in earnest in late 2011,
when lay individuals began building stimulation devices and applying low levels of electricity to
their heads for self-improvement purposes (Wexler 2016b). Today, in lieu of constructing their
own devices, most individuals purchase one of more than a dozen different direct-to-consumer
apparatuses that are available to the general public. As some use the phrase “DIY brain
stimulation” to refer to the actual construction of the device and others use it in reference to the
unsupervised nature of stimulation itself, here I adopt the term “home users” to describe those
who stimulate their own brains outside of medical and academic settings.
It has now been five years since home users began utilizing brain stimulation, and the
anniversary marks a critical juncture at which to assess the movement’s overall trajectory.
Indeed, a number of points have become clear: first, while some predicted that home use of brain
stimulation would become widespread, the practice has yet to gain a foothold amongst the
general public. Rather, it has remained a subculture, likely fueled in part by media coverage in
major outlets like Radiolab, Wired and the New Yorker. Second, informal observations have

l
a
n
o
si

suggested that the attrition rate among home users appears to be significant: many home users

who I interviewed several years ago are no longer actively using stimulation, and there is a large
amount of turnover on the Reddit.com forum dedicated to transcranial direct current stimulation
(tDCS). Thus, it remains to be seen whether tDCS is something that users utilize fleetingly or

i
v
o
r
P

whether it has true staying power. Third, while no significant adverse events have been reported
among home users of brain stimulation on Internet forums, tingling, headache, dizziness, and

skin redness are common side effects (Jwa 2015), and there have been occasional mentions of
skin burns.1

To date, scholarship on the home use of brain stimulation has focused on characterizing
the practices of users via quantitative and qualitative studies (Jwa 2015; Wexler 2016), and on
analyzing related ethical (Hamilton et al. 2011; Cohen-Kadosh et al. 2012; Cabrera et al. 2013)
and regulatory issues (Maslen et al. 2015; Wexler 2015; Fitz & Reiner 2015). In this perspective

piece, however, I take the opposite approach: rather than viewing the home use of brain
stimulation on its own, I argue that it must be understood within the context of other DIY and
citizen science movements. Seen in this light, the home use of brain stimulation is only a small
part of the “neurohacking” movement, which is comprised of individuals attempting to optimize
their brains to achieve enhanced performance. Neurohacking itself is an offshoot of the “life
hacking” (or “quantified self”) movement, in which individuals self-track minute aspects of their
daily lives in order to enhance productivity or performance (Swan 2013). Additionally, the home
or DIY use of brain stimulation is in many ways parallel to the DIY Biology (or “biohacking”)
movement, which seeks to democratize tools of scientific experimentation (Delfanti 2013). Here,
I describe the place of the home use of brain stimulation with regard to neurohackers,
lifehackers, and biohackers, and suggest that it is only by viewing the movement within broader
social and cultural contexts that ethical and regulatory questions can be appropriately understood
and addressed.
Brain enhancement in the digital age: neurohackers

Since the turn of the 21st century, neuroscience has had an increasing place in the public
realm (Rose and Abi-Rached 2013; O’Connor 2013). Empirical studies have examined

representations of neuroscience (and neuroimaging) in the media (Racine, Bar-Ilan, & Iles 2005,
2006; Racine et al. 2010; O’Connor, Rees & Joffe 2012), as well as the alluring appeal of

i
v
o
r
P

neuroscience explanations (Weisberg et al. 2008). In the early 2000s a flood of popular science
books, such as The Brain that Changes Itself, helped catapult neuroscience into the self-help
arena, and the neuroscience concept of “plasticity” was co-opted into a mantra for personal
growth and spirituality. Rather than a passive organ that exists as an immutable part of our

bodies, the brain has been increasingly conceptualized as something to be exercised, re-shaped,
and maximized. Indeed, a study of brain-related articles published in six United Kingdom
newspapers between 2000 and 2010 found that 43% characterized the brain as a “resource to be
optimized” (O’Connor, Rees & Joffe 2012).

In an effort to capitalize on the brain optimization trend, a number of companies—such
as Lumosity, PositScience, and CogniFit—began selling brain-training software games. The
products emphasized the idea of brain fitness, and were marketed to those wanting to stave off

2

age-related cognitive decline or even dementia. Though the generalizability of brain-training
games to other domains has repeatedly been called into question (e.g., Foroughi et al. 2016; Au
et al. 2016), and the Federal Trade Commission has recently taken action against several
companies for misleading marketing claims (FTC 2016a, 2016b), the brain-training game market
is still thriving, with $67 million in sales in North America in 2015 alone (Sparks 2016).
Even without training, the brain has come to be viewed as something that can be
enhanced—via drugs (both legal and illegal), dietary supplements, food, drinks, and even
chewing gum. Websites and forums have sprung up dedicated to the world of “nootropics,” a
term used to describe “smart drugs” and dietary supplements that (supposedly) improve one’s
intelligence or cognitive ability. Today, the Reddit.com forum on nootropics has 80,000
subscribers and averages several posts daily. More recently, Silicon Valley start-ups like
Nootrobox (tagline: “nootropics for everyone”) have sought to bring brain-boosting supplements
to the mainstream.
In parallel to the commercialization of “brain optimization” games and nootropics, a
number of companies began developing pared-down versions of neuroscience tools, such as
electroencephalography (EEG) devices, and marketing them directly to consumers.2 Although

The rise of brain training, the increasing availability of brain-enhancing drugs and

supplements, and the commercialization of neuroscience tools all set the foundation for the

emergence of DIY and direct-to-consumer brain stimulation. Viewed myopically, the home use
of brain stimulation can be perceived as individuals merely adapting scientific techniques for use
on themselves. But considered more broadly, the movement is part-and-parcel of the

“neurohacking” movement, and cannot be fully comprehended without understanding the overall
drive for brain enhancement.
Yet compared to other “neurohacking” techniques, the lay use of brain stimulation
represents only a very small piece of the puzzle: the Reddit forum on nootropics has ten times
the number of subscribers as its tDCS counterpart; and there are dozens, if not hundreds, of
companies selling brain-boosting nootropics, compared to roughly a dozen direct-to-consumer
tDCS companies (the majority of which are individuals building and selling devices from home
in their spare time). Although there are no official estimates regarding the size of the consumer
brain stimulation market, based on my interviews with manufacturers of brain stimulation
devices, it seems that tens of thousands of devices have been sold in the last several years—
though current users may only comprise a small proportion of that figure. By comparison, a
single brain-training company, Lumosity, reported having 70 million subscribers in 2015
(Lumosity 2015). Thus, as will be discussed below, when developing policies and regulations for
the home use of brain stimulation, it may be prudent not to focus solely on stimulation but to
develop frameworks that encompass direct-to-consumer enhancement products as a whole.

Citizen science and the democratization of scientific tools: biohackers

When DIY brain stimulation first emerged, some suggested adopting an open-

engagement approach akin to that taken to DIY Biology (Fitz & Reiner 2013), which is a

i
v
o
r
P

movement of makers and tinkerers doing biology in kitchens and garages (Roosth 2010; Ledford
2010; Wohlsen 2012; Delfanti 2013; Delgado 2013; Meyer 2013; Sanchez 2014). The

proposition has, to some extent, come to fruition: a recent open letter authored by four

neuroscientists (and signed by 39 other researchers) directly addressed home users, and in
measured tones, outlined the unknown risks of brain stimulation (Wurzmann et al. 2016).

Indeed, the two movements share many similarities: like home users of brain stimulation,
those who identify with DIY Biology are interested in democratizing the tools of science, and
use an online forum (a Google group) as their main nexus of interaction. The DIY Biology forum
discussions, like those on the Reddit.com tDCS forum, center on topics such as acquiring tools to
carry out home experiments, sourcing inexpensive equipment, and constructing affordable
versions of laboratory tools. Both movements rely heavily on scientific counterparts: home users

4

look to scientific articles for guidance (and frequently link to them online) and DIY biologists
rely on the infrastructure built up by synthetic biology (Roosth 2010).
Members of both movements embody what has become known as the maker culture,
which places a high value on tinkering, engineering, and creating things from scratch. There are
ongoing debates on the DIY biology list about what is considered “real” DIY: Roosth (2010,
126-7) writes that once “an argument broke out about whether it was truly ‘DIY’ to order gel
starter kits and other readymade products from biological supply companies.” Similar debates
took place in the DIY tDCS community after the release of the first direct-to-consumer devices:
those who purchased ready-made devices were derided for not doing sufficient “homework” to
understand electrical circuitry.
But a deeper excavation of the underlying goals of each community reveals fundamental
differences. The primary goal of home users of brain stimulation, whether self-treating for
depression or attempting to enhance their memory, is self-improvement. By contrast, the goal of
DIY biology is more political in nature: DIY biologists talk about redistributing power and
fundamentally revising the way that science is done (Delgado and Callen 2016). A “biopunk
manifesto” written by one DIY biologist asserts: “We the biopunks are dedicated to putting the

l
a
n
o
si

tools of scientific investigation in the hands of anyone who wants them” (Patterson 2010, as

quoted in Delfanti 2013, 126). According to Delfanti (2013, 115), “right now citizen biology is
not a site of research and innovation but rather of political, artistic, and educational
experimentation.”

i
v
o
r

While in many ways the home use of brain stimulation is an inherently political act—
against the scientific community’s tendency to restrict knowledge and devices to a privileged
few—the movement is characterized by a culture of deference and respect toward scientific

institutions, as it is the scientific knowledge that will ultimately help users achieve their self-

improvement goals. But in DIY Biology, it is politics, not self-improvement, that takes center
stage. As Roosth (2010, 112) writes: “biohackers do not pursue or promote science as a path to
personal improvement or refinement, but as a pleasure and a kind of political speech.” Thus
while DIY biologists and home users may appear rather similar at the surface level — in terms of
what they talk about, how they talk about it, their reliance on science and their existence on the
edges of it — their underlying goals are in fact quite different. Therefore, when considering

5

policy approaches for the various DIY and citizen science movements, it is crucial to understand
the goals and motivations of each, no matter how similar they may outwardly appear.
Digital tracking and quantified self: lifehackers
Like home users of brain stimulation, those who identify with the “life hacking” or
quantified self (QS) movement have the ultimate goal of enhancing themselves; they track
various aspects of their lives in order to improve (or “hack”) them (Swan 2013; Lupton 2013;
Selke 2016). Lifehackers, more commonly known as self-trackers or QSers, place a high value
on the collection and analysis of information; data is thought to illuminate knowledge of the self.
Self-trackers frequently engage in forms of self-experimentation. For example, they may
hypothesize about which factors affect their cognition or mood (Roberts 2004, 2010): does
drinking coffee after 3 pm cause me to stay up late, and does eating Bleu cheese make me more
alert? Self-trackers test such hypotheses, often plotting the resulting data on graphs and
attempting to derive meaning from them. When it comes to data analysis, they struggle with the
same issues as home users of brain stimulation: namely, the methodological limitations of a

l
a
n
o
si

sample size of one. To date, self-trackers have not published aggregated data on their
experiments in a peer-reviewed journal.

As a whole, self-trackers are a more coherent and organized group than home users of

brain stimulation. In addition to annual international and regional “quantified self” conferences,

i
v
o
r
P

there are over 200 groups in more than 30 different countries where individuals meet to share the
results of their self-experimentation data, presenting what they did, how they did it, and what
they learned (Nafus & Sherman 2013; Barta & Neff 2016). In contrast, home users of brain

stimulation have never coalesced into an official group, and there has been no formal gathering
of any kind (Wexler 2016).

Home users of brain stimulation share the same ethos as self-trackers: namely, they
experiment on themselves, report their methods, and share their results, no matter how personal
or private. However, home users focus narrowly on two forms of self-improvement—cognitive
enhancement and/or self-treatment—using a single intervention, that of noninvasive brain
neurostimulation. Self-trackers are interested more broadly in productivity, mood and
performance. For them, an intervention is not always required—often insight can be gained

6

merely by analyzing self-tracking data. There is likely overlap between the groups, and at least
some self-trackers have also tried brain stimulation: Dave Asprey, a prominent figure in the
lifehacking movement, included a direct-to-consumer brain stimulation device in a recent
shipment to subscribers of his quarterly productivity package.
Like neurohacking, self-tracking has become commercialized and commodified: whereas
users once entered data manually into Excel spreadsheets, today there are hundreds, if not
thousands, of mobile apps and wearable sensors that facilitate the tracking of sleeping patterns,
fitness levels, eating habits, productivity, and mood. Activity monitors like the FitBit and
Jawbone have become commonplace, and new iPhones come pre-loaded with Apple’s suite of
health-monitoring applications. Though some of these technologies are geared to those managing
illnesses, they are marketed equally as “wellness” products to healthy individuals. As Schüll
(2016, 3) puts it, there is now a culture of “data for life” where our own wellness “depends on
the continuous collection, analysis and management of personal data through digital sensor
technologies.”
Discussion

l
a

Viewed broadly, the home use of brain stimulation sits at the nexus of maker and DIY

cultures, citizen science movements, and self-experimentation and self-tracking initiatives. Like
“biohackers,” home users source inexpensive versions of restricted laboratory tools for use at

i
v
o
r
P

home; like “life hackers,” they are primarily interested in self-improvement. Though the home

use of noninvasive brain stimulation has received a significant amount of attention in both media
outlets and scholarly journals, it remains a very small part of the overall “neurohacking”
movement, wherein individuals aim to optimize their brain function.

Although here I have discussed neurohackers, biohackers, and lifehackers separately, it is
important to note that there is fluidity amongst the terms: for example, some use “life hackers”
and “biohackers” interchangeably to refer to DIY Biology, whereas others use “biohackers” to
refer only to those who physically modify their bodies for self-improvement purposes.
Furthermore, those who use commercial wellness or self-tracking products—like the Muse
headset or a FitBit—may not self-identify with any kind of “hacking” movement.

help inform regulatory and ethical issues? First, it can help maintain an awareness of the larger
policy question at hand related to “neurohacking,” which is how to regulate the entire ecosystem
of products (e.g., brain stimulation devices, EEG recording devices, brain-training games)
marketed directly to consumers to enhance their brain function. For example, should “cognitive
enhancement” products be considered similar to medical devices and therefore regulated by Food
and Drug Administration (FDA)? Or should they be conceptualized closer to “wellness” or
“fitness” products, and therefore subject to a less stringent degree of oversight from authorities
such as the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) or the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC)? As I have argued previously (Wexler 2016a), enforcement clarity is needed to establish
which agencies will exercise primary authority over these products.
In addition, explicitly identifying movements and locating the connections between them
can help draw together scholars studying parallel phenomenon from disparate disciplines. This
paper has drawn on literature from sociology, bioethics, STS (science, technology, and society),
and neuroscience; however, DIY technologies and citizen movements are also being examined
from legal, medical, economic, and securities studies perspectives, among others (see, e.g.,
Doherty 2012; Bryans 2015; Lee et al., 2016; Awori & Lee 2017; Bolton & Thomas 2014;

l
a
n
o
si

Walther 2015; Snow 2015; Wang & Kaye 2011). Across disciplines, scholars use different

frameworks and language to describe similar phenomenon—for example, conceiving of DIY

techniques as “radical leveling technologies” (Snow, 2015) or studying how they “democratize

innovation” (von Hippel, 2009). In the case of neurohackers, biohackers, and lifehackers, it may

i
v
o
r
P

be fruitful to bridge traditional disciplinary divides and share insights to better understand how
these movements work.

While it is important to keep in mind the overall similarities across movements, this
perspective piece has also focused on describing goals and motivations within movements.
Indeed, a sociological and cultural awareness of the individual movements themselves is

essential for the development of sound policy, as it can help predict the potential outcome of
regulation. For example, a heavy-handed regulatory approach to noninvasive brain stimulation
might have the effect of drawing more attention to a movement that may not be particularly large
to begin with (this phenomenon has been described as the “Streisand effect,” see Jansen and
Brian, 2015). Furthermore, knowledge of users’ motivations for using noninvasive brain
stimulation might be useful in terms of predicting whether or not users might go “underground”

8

in response to regulation; for example, those using brain stimulation to treat depression may be
more likely to do so than those using the technology for enhancement. Economists have
described a variety of other unwanted effects that can occur when regulations are set forth with a
lack of cultural and sociological awareness, see, e.g., “compliance without effect” as described in
Bryans (2014:909) and “motivation crowding” (see, e.g., Frey & Jegen, 1999). Ultimately, a
policy approach for the home use of brain stimulation should have an appreciation both of
individual motivations as well as the broader social context of the movement itself.
The present discussion has also highlighted the trend towards the commercialization of
DIY tools and techniques for the optimization of performance. Although scholarship to-date has
discussed many of the ethical issues that arise from the home use of brain stimulation, there are
additional complications that may arise when such tools are commercialized and sold to others.
For example, even beyond the requirements of the law, do companies have an ethical
responsibility to guide consumers towards responsible and safe uses of neurostimulation devices,
or to caution against their use in vulnerable populations? Given that the number of companies

regulation of consumer brain stimulation
devices requires a multi-disciplinary
approach—one that, in addition to scientific
and legal analyses, demonstrates an acute
sociological awareness.
Anna Wexler 4/3/17 3:38 PM
Deleted: While policies could be developed
that are specific to the home use of brain
stimulation, regulatory bodies should be aware
that the phenomenon is a small subculture as
compared to other brain optimization
initiatives. It may therefore be prudent to
consider broad-brush policies that would
encompass the range of consumer
neurotechnology and brain enhancement
products. In addition, while comparisons
across DIY and citizen science may prove to
be fruitful, it is important to keep in mind
differences across the movements’ underlying
motivations and goals.

manufacturing direct-to-consumer enhancement technologies is likely to only increase, it may be
fruitful for neuroethicists to collaborate with business ethicists, who study the ethical

responsibilities of corporations outside of legal ones.

The present perspective piece has attempted to situate the home use of brain stimulation
in its broader social milieu, providing context for the rise of the phenomenon and describing its
parallels to concurrent cultural movements. Sociologists have long emphasized that social

i
v
o
r
P

phenomena do not exist in isolation; rather they sit in relation to other phenomena, and cultural
memes circulate across domains. As I have shown here, the home use of brain stimulation did

not emerge from the ether, but arose from the confluence of DIY and citizen science movements,
neuroenhancement initiatives, and a culture of self-tracking.
