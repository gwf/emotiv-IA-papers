Aims and Objectives of the “StrokeBack” Project :
Telemedicine supervision of rehabilitation exercise.
Continuous monitoring of impact of the exercises also in “normal” life situations.
Integrated telemedicine rehabilitation and Personal Health Records for improved long term evaluation of patient recovery.
Providing feedback to health care professionals on the impact of rehabilitation exercises

Advanced Media in the Context of the Project:
Games: Application Interface (API) for supporting game development.
3D body tracing: improving accuracy of 3D model matching and detection of precise hand and finger movements
Kinect & 3D Engines: mapping patient’s skeleton as avatar in commercial 3D Engines (e.g. CryTek, Unreal, etc).
Sensor Networking: sensor BAN for improved understanding of skeleton position and patient’s physiological condition

Conclusions and Future Work:
•
•
•
•
•

Validate means of animating avatars with Kinect using commercial 3D engines (CryTek and/or other engines)
Develop algorithms for 3D modelling with Kinect for more accurate motion tracking
Integrate client system on a low-cost embedded platform (e.g. Raspberry PI @ 25USD)
Integration of rehabilitation gaming into Personal Health Record (PHR) system as a “treatment”
Research into EEG signal matching to physical motion deficiencies
The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union
Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement n° 288692.
