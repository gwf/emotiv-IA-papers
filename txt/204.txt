ABSTRACT
Recent developments in Brain Computer Interfacing (BCI) and neuroprosthetics have played a vital role
for disable people to expect better life quality. In this contribution Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals
acquired from six healthy test subjects, are used for the offline analysis of BCI through classification of
four lower limb movements including talocrural (ankle) joint dorsi-planter flexion and knee joint
extension-flexion. Fourteen channel Emotive EPOC head set is used to acquire EEG signals from
sensorimotor cortex area of brain, using a particular data acquisition timeline protocol. Features are
extracted in time domain from raw EEG data. Power spectral density, variance, mean value and kurtosis
features are applied on raw EEG signals. Multiple classification algorithms are implemented for
discrimination of four lower limb movements within data set. The paper uses Quadratic discriminant
analysis, Naïve Bayes and Support vector machine classifiers to stratify the movement intent of lower
limb. Maximum classification accuracies achieved through various classifiers are; 86.35% with average
band power & QDA, 84.38% with mean value & QDA and 78.13% with power spectral density &
Quadratic-SVM. The presented findings are optimistic in making the path easier towards the
development of BCIs with rich EEG based control signals using noninvasive technology.
Keywords: kurtosis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine.

Introduction

BCI technologies decode signals acquired from brain activities in order to translate the human intentions
into useful readable commands to control external devices like prosthetics or computer applications. It
provide an alternative opportunity to people suffering from severe diseases causing paralysis and motor
disabilities. It is an emerging technique nowadays and provide a communication facility to control and
actuate devices using brain signals [1]. Various techniques have been adopted to extract signals from
brain which includes magneto electroencephalography (MEG), Functional magnetic resonance imaging

(fMRI), near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), electrocarticogram (ECoG) and electroencephalography (EEG)
[1] & [2]. Among these aforementioned techniques signals acquisition using EEG is a rapid infusion in BCI
since it reflects the electrical responses of human brain in actions and it is widely used because of its
noninvasiveness, higher temporal resolution, Inexpensiveness, and no exposure to radiations.
In this contribution EEG data is collected from brain using EMOTIV Headset [13] with fourteen channel
electrodes. The main benefit of using emotive headset is that it provides better portability along with
providing a noninvasive medium for collection of EEG data. According to a survey majority of the cases
of strokes or brain injuries causes disability of people and this type of disability can be addressed either
by providing a prosthetic device or by restoring the motor function of such disable patients [6].
Nowadays with the advancements in the field of biomedical engineering, evoked potential recorded
from brain combining with the robotic feedback is used to help people with disabilities. Some of the
most recent and important research applications of BCI are human to human interface, control of a
prosthetic robotic arm, exoskeleton control, mobile and guided robotics [4].
In this paper, classification of offline EEG data signals for lower limb joints movements is presented in
which two knee movements (extension & flexion) and two talocrural (ankle) movements (dorsiflexion &
plantarflexion) are included. According to literature review most of the work on EEG signals classification
is carried out on distinguishing the movements of upper limbs which includes carpus, ante brachium,
fingers and hand gestures whereas for lower limb movements higher number of electrodes are required
to record the evoke potential from the scalp of the brain, as the signals are quite weak and noisy. Table
1 shows brief survey of bunch of the classification & features extraction techniques which have been
implemented to classify different lower limb movements.

filter is applied for removal of noise and undesirable artifacts from the data set. Further this paper uses
multiple feature extraction techniques to figure out the prominent features and supervised learning
classification algorithms to stratify lower limb movements including knee joint extension & flexion and
talocrural joint dorsiflexion & plantarflexion.

Methodology and Data Acquisition

An experimental protocol for data acquisition is designed for offline analysis of the time series EEG data.
Six volunteers (3 males & 3 females) age between 21 to 30 years participated in the data acquisition
experimentation without any prior training of the experimental procedure. All test subjects are
physically healthy and neurologically stable. Data acquisition is carried out in noiseless room with
subjects sitting comfortably in a chair with arms rested on sides. The subjects performed the
movements shown on a computer screen in the form of a video in which a person is performing lower
limb movements (knee joint extension, knee joint flexion, talocrural joint dorsiflexion and talocrural
joint plantarflexion). The test subjects are instructed to avoid any eye blinking, facial expressions in
order to minimize unnecessary artifacts while performing the limb movements. Twenty five trials of
each type of movement with 1000 data points in 9.50 seconds are acquired from each subject. Figure 1
shows the block diagram of whole process.

Figure 1: Block Diagram of Brain Computer Interface System

Figure 2: Lower Limb Movements

EEG signals recorded in this paper are based on the international 10-20 system [13] which are AF3, F7,
F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, and AF4 respectively. Signals were recorded at 128 Hz
sampling rate and they are spontaneous signals as these signals have rhythmicity. It can be divided into
different frequency bands out of which alpha (8-13Hz) and beta (14-30Hz) frequency bands [14] are
more dominant during the state of consciousness and limbs movements therefore these two bands are
filtered by applying Butterworth filter (8-30Hz) for the classification of lower limb movements, as
Butterworth filter have smooth pas bands as compared to other types of filters.

Emotiv Headset equipped with 14 active electrodes is used to record visually evoked response from the
sensorimotor cortex on the scalp of the brain. Specifications of the Emotiv headset are discussed in
below mentioned table 2 [13].

Filtration of Acquired EEG Data

Once the data is recorded, band pass filter is applied (8-30Hz) in both forward and reverse direction with
sampling frequency of 500Hz. In Brain computer interfacing, the purpose of filtration is to minimize the
undesirable artifacts recorded during data acquisition [9]. Most common source of artifacts are
physiological artifacts like eye movement and muscles movements [7], where eye movements have
frequency of 2-5 Hz which are removed by bandpass filter[10] & [17]. Frequency response of the sixth
order Butterworth filter, raw and filtered EEG data is shown in figure 3.

Feature Extraction

Multiple feature extraction techniques are implemented to extract the features from filtered EEG data
in time domain [16]. Average band power (PSD) [12] provides us information about the distribution of
time series data over different frequencies. It shows the variation of data with respect to different
frequencies.

difficulties like overfitting of data during classification. Topographical distribution of feature vectors

convergence of the data over the left hemisphere of frontal lobe of motor cortex.

Classification Techniques

Once the feature vectors are extracted from filtered EEG data, these feature vectors are classified into
four classes representing four types of lower limb movements. This paper used Quadratic Discriminant
Analysis (QDA), Naïve Bayes and one to one support vector machine (SVM) [12] & [14] with quadratic
kernel. Mathematically QDA can be formulated as;

Naïve Bayes [15] is based on Bayesian Theorem according to which it splits the posterior in terms of
prior distribution and likelihood. Bayes classifier assumes that the values of a particular feature of EEG
signal is unrelated to the presence or absence of any other feature translation given the class.

implemented to classify EEG data among four classes by drawing a nonlinear hyperplane.

The research work carried out in this paper has of great importance as one can understand that how
specific neural activity differs from the other motor cortex area, as primary motor cortex of brain is
organized such that the left side of the primary cortex is responsible for the movements of right side of
the body and right side of brain cortex is responsible for movements of left side of the body. Stratified
and cross validated results along with the weighted average results of Naïve Bayes and average band
power, Kurtosis & Variance as feature set, are presented in table 4.

The deviation in results occur due to variation in the size of classes as it increases the misclassification
rate and the weighted average of false positives. As shown in table 4, weighted average of false positives
in case of average band power is 0.083, in case of kurtosis 0.150 and in case of variance 0.092 whereas
weighted average for true positives is 0.750, 0.550 and 0.725 respectively. In this research, a novel
combination of feature vectors and classification algorithms has been implemented to decode lower
limb movements (knee and talocrural joint extension/flexion) with maximum classification accuracy of
86.25%.

feature vectors. In this study, the performance of Quadratic discriminant analysis, Naïve Bayes and
Support vector machine using average band power, mean value, variance and kurtosis feature vectors
for the classification of four lower limb movements has been analyzed. The performance metric for this
study was to achieve better classification accuracy by using lesser number of EEG electrodes. At the
culmination of this research work, it was shown that maximum classification accuracy of 86.25% is
achieved using 14 channel Emotive headset. Future work is aimed at the online EEG data acquisition and
processing along with interfacing of robotic lower limb with FPGA controller and Emotiv Headset.
