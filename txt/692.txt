Abstract—We present an attention training system based on the
principles of multitasking training scenario and neurofeedback,
which can be targeted on PCs and VR platforms. Our training
system is a video game following the principle of multitasking
training, which is designed for all ages. It adopts a non-invasive
Electroencephalography (EEG) device Emotiv EPOC+ to collect
EEG. Then wavelet package transformation(WPT) is applied to
extract specific components of EEG signals. We then build a
multi-class supporting vector machine(SVM) to classify different
attention levels. The training system is built with the Unity game
engine, which can be targeted on both desktops and Oculus
VR headsets. We also launched an experiment by applying the
system to preliminarily evaluate the effectiveness of our system.
The results show that our system can generally improve users’
abilities of multitasking and attention level.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Attention training is an efficacious neurobehavioral therapy
for the emotional disorder, and is considered to be the standard
interventions for these disorders [1]. Unfortunately, attention
training is not always easy to apply because the training system
should be both theoretical supported and have the objective
evaluation properties.
To solve these problems, biometric information such as electroencephalogram(EEG) [2] is applied as a reference to evaluate the attention level [3]. Cognitive training uses on-going
computer feedback to reinforce correct responses, thus training
attention and working memory and decreasing impulsivity [4].
Neurofeedback provides immediate feedback on any change of
brainwave patterns, which represents the attention level, back
to the training process. Such a technique is used clinically
as auxiliary treatments of insomnia, pain, Attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other diseases. [5] [6] [4]
The basic working principle of neurofeedback training technology consists of recording the brain activity, decoding or
identifying the brain patterns of interest, and providing users
with relevant feedback stimuli based on the current/required
working levels of their brain rhythms [7]. For our system
specifically, it monitors a user’s attention while collects the

game performance in real time. It further improves the user’s
performance as well as attention level by training multiple
times. Moreover, the virtual reality(VR) devices provide not
only more immersive experience but also enhance biofeedback effects because the visual system is one of the factors
influencing EEG activity and attention [8].

II. R ELATED W ORK
The state-of-the-art researches show that just one hour of
gaming may improve attention [9]. Attention training and
cognitive enhancement through the video game are expected
to be an efficient and easy practical way [10]. The relationship
between video games and human social, political, mental,
physical, and even creative variables has been studied [11].
Llorens et al [12] investigated video games as a therapeutic
tool for cognitive behavioral therapy(CBT) during treatments
for clients with bulimia nervosa. They looked at how CBT
coupled with a serious video game can address a clients
emotional dysregulation and demonstrated that CBT coupled
with video games is a good tool to use. Similarly, studies also
conduced by Rernandez-Aranda [13] and Chang [14], which
shed some light on the possibilities of using video games in
counseling and psychotherapy. Meanwhile, For a long time,
immersive VR with cognitive training is effective for attention
enhancement [15].
Neurofeedback techniques were introduced in psychotherapy
studies. Steiner et al [16] fit the training methods to the
treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, relying on
the patients’ self-conscious to strengthen some particular brain
waves and applied the feedback to help therapy. However, this
treatment is clinically unstable, especially for those special
clinics with poor compliance towards the treatment, resulting
in poor neurofeedback. Anguera et al [17] also developed a
cognitive control system to train the elderly through multitasking training. This therapy scheme achieved very good results.
But the game itself was not embedded with reaction to users’
performance and neurofeedback.

III. M ETHODS
Figure 1 shows the workflow of our system. Firstly, the data
are collected using a noninvasive method of the EEG signal
measurement using EMOTIV EPOC+ 14-Channel Wireless
EEG Headset. The data from the process of data acquisition
were registered using Emotiv TestBench software. Secondly,
we use Wavelet Packet Decomposition(WPD) to extract features of EEG signals and use Support Vector Machine(SVM)
to build the classifier. The following step comes to generate
game commands based on the decoded attention level from
neuro-information. Those commands are fused to the adjust
attention training system on the fly. Therefore, parameters of
the training system are tuned based both on the post-processed
neuro-information and behavior of users.
A. EEG Signal Processing Module
Emotiv SDK provides TestBench to show the device connection status and report real-time changes of brainwave
signals gathered from 14 channels(AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7,
P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, AF4). Fig. 2 shows the
positions of electrodes and the raw data collected from Emotiv
TestBench. We record the frontal lobe electrode (F3, F4, F7,
F8, FP1, FP2) with 128Hz sampling frequency because the
rapid processing of the frontal lobe information is one of the
most important features of the brain multitasking capabilities
[18].
The pre-processing stage removes the noise of raw data

coming from eyelids movement, blinking, and teeth clenching,
etc. Those noises can be clearly seen that all the electrodes
registered a considerable change of the EEG signal. The main
components of EEG signal are concentrated in the 0.5-30Hz,
and the frequency of interference EMG signal usually exceeds
100Hz. In the pre-processing, we applied pre-filter to the
original signal with bandpass 0.5Hz-63.5Hz to get only useful
information.
Feature extraction techniques such as time domain, frequency
domain, and time-frequency domain methods [19]. Due to the
non-stationary property of EEG signals, the wavelet packet
transform (WPT) is considered to be one of the most suitable choices to use time-frequency domain methods. Wavelet
Packet Decomposition (WPD) decomposes the EEG data into
a mutually orthogonal set of wavelets. Both detail and approximation coefficients are decomposed to create the full binary
tree. The energy of special sub-bands and corresponding
coefficients of wavelet packet decomposition is selected as
features that satisfy maximal separability according to the
Fisher distance criterion.
In this work, we adopted Daubechies 4(db4) wavelet because
its smoothing feature is suitable for detecting changes in EEG
signals. The number of decomposition levels is chosen based
on the frequency sub-bands we are interested, which are listed
in Table I. We obtain four types of signalδ, θ, α and β from 6

electrons and then calculated their energy separately to build
the feature vector. For the EEG signal with length N , the
energy is computed as
N −1
E(x) = σn=0

Then for the 4 selected signals, the energy for each or them
is:
E(xi )
E(i) = 4
where i = 1, 2, 3, 4
(2)
Σi=1 E(xi )
Classification can be done with Support Vector Machine
(SVM), which is a supervised learning method to analyze data
and distinguish patterns.
Inspired by the previous works that either construct a single
hyper-plane to divide EEG data into attention/in-attention
modes or use multi-class SVM to distinguish different activities, we build a multi-class SVM to differentiate multi-level
attention.
During the training stage, we collect the EEG data from 20
users while they are in the resting state or playing different
game levels of our training system. There are four states:
resting, game level 1, game level 2, and game level 2 with

multi-tasking, which are labeled accordingly. For each user,
we collect 3 pieces of data twice for each state. Then an SVM
library, LIBSVM, is used to train a multi-calss SVM. Given
the training dataset of n points of form (x~1 , y1 ), ...(x~n , yn ) can
be mapped into high-dimensional feature space as separable
samplesΦ1 (x), Φ2 (x)... with labels.
Compared to the classifier based on the hot topic neural
network, this straightforward method is less likely to become
overfitting, which is a common case in learning-based solution.

B. Video Game of Attention Training in VR
The screen shots of our system are shown in Fig. 3. We
adopt the multitasking training technique and transformed this
technique into a video game. Our game is a combination of
a racing game and a balloon shooting game, which requests
the users to drive while reacting to the spawned balloons with
characters.
In the racing game, a player uses the keyboard to control
the direction of the car to finish the routes while avoiding
obstacles. Different levels come with different difficulties with
driving routes. The balloon shooting game is that the player
reacts to the spawned balloons with characters as soon as
possible before they flow up to the end. The system will
check the game status every 10 seconds to adjust the speed
of both the car and the balloon generation(higher speed for
better performance). Game scores consist of car speed, average
reaction time, and reaction accuracy. Each item with full mark
5 is evaluated and finally added up together with full mark 15.
Before the assessment of multitasking costs, an adaptive
staircase algorithm was used to determine the difficulty levels
of the game based on the scores each participant performed
in the car-racing-only task.
IV. E XPERIMENTS
A. Experiment Design
The experiment participators are divided to the experimental
group and the control group. Participants are required to
do a stress evaluation questionnaire first to decide which
group they are in. Clients with obvious high-stress level are
assigned to the experimental group, also 16 clients in the
group are diagnosed as generalized anxiety disorder(GAD)
patients. Other participants with low-level stress are in the
control group. The experiment procedure is:

•
•

•

Step 1: Before training stage: do a self-evaluation by
completing the form as Table II.
Step 2: Pre-training stage: do the car racing task to assign
each of the participators an initial difficulty level.
Step 3: Resting stage 1: relax for 5 minutes and record
EEG data as resting-state data.
Step 4: Training stage: do multitasking experiment for
15-20 minutes, recording their performance.
Step 5: Resting stage 2: relax again for 5 minutes and
record EEG data again.
Step 6: Testing stage: relax for 15 minutes and do the
multitasking experiment for another 5 minutes.

B. Results
We record the game performance as the effectiveness measurements of our system. In the pre-training stage, the system
assigns each user a difficulty level for the following training
stage according to his/her game performance(car racing). This
is done because the performances vary a lot for the users with
different backgrounds of the individuals. For example, Figure
5 shows the records of the experimental group in the pretraining stage.
In the training stage, participants are required to do the
multitasking game challenge. Table III presents the average
game scores gained by both groups after that. Figures 4b
and 4c compare the performance gathered from the training
stage and testing stage, demonstrating the reaction time and
reaction accuracy. From the results, we see that the accuracy
of multitasking improves a lot while the reaction time declines
as well overall. Therefore, we conclude that our system could
improve users’ reaction speed and multitasking performance
to some degree which means the improvement of attention.

V. C ONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we choose an attention training scheme that
is widely applied and transform it into a video game that can
be played both on PC and in the virtual reality environment.
We then augment this video game as a neurofeedback BCI
system with gathering and analyzing users’ EEG signals.
For the training system, a feedback module, which contains
neurofeedback and game performance feedbacks is designed
with classifying EEG data into multiple attention levels. We
finally conducted experiments to preliminarily evaluate the
effectiveness of our system. The system itself is user-friendly,
extensible, and with good reliability. From the experiments,
we could say this system played a role in attention level
improvement and helped to decrease the anxiety level.
However, our work focus on the system architecture and there
are many aspects in the application that are waiting to be tested
accurately.
