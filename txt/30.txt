ABSTRACT Massage therapy (MT) is a useful complementary and alternative therapy widely used in
treating low back pain (LBP), including lumbar disc herniation (LDH). However, few studies revealed
the quantitative entropy-based features of electroencephalography (EEG) for the MT effectiveness for the
LDH patients. This study investigated the immediate effects of Chinese massage on four EEG rhythms,
using the eight entropy-based features (approximation entropy (ApEn), Sample Entropy (SampEn), wavelet
entropy (WaveEn), Hilbert-Huang Transform Marginal spectrum entropy (HHTMSEn), normalized energy,
permutation entropy (PE), Fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn), and Inherent fuzzy entropy (IFE)) in the 26 LDH
patients and 24 healthy controls. Results showed that after MT in LDH group, ApEn, SampEn, WaveEn, PE,
FuzzyEn, and IFE features of the delta rhythm decreased, the normalized energy of delta rhythm significantly
increased in the left hemisphere and theta/alpha rhythms significantly decreased. Furthermore, HHTMSEn
feature of theta and beta rhythms showed the significant difference for two groups (LDH and control group)
in two states (before and after massage). Ten classifiers were applied in classifying two groups or two states
in one group, and most of them reached high averaged accuracies and the area under the curve (AUC), even
with different length per epoch (1024, 512, and 256 points). It indicated that the entropy-based features
and permutation disalignment index (PDI) of EEG rhythms could be promising indices of the massage
effectiveness for LDH patients and control group. Rhythms’ SampEn scalp topography in two groups showed
the significant different complexity change between two states (before and after massage).

I. INTRODUCTION

Low back pain (LBP) is among the top three causes of all-age
years lived with disability (YLDs) in 1990, and is also the first
leading cause of YLDs for both sexes combined in 126 of
the 195 countries in 2017 in the Global Burden of Disease
Study 2017 [1]. Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one cause
of LBP. LBP affects people of all ages, and LBP was more

common in those aged 40-69 years than in other age groups
and in female than male individuals [2]. So far, LBP causes a
lot of economic burden globally, and the largest proportion of
direct medical costs for LBP was spent on physical therapy
(17%) and inpatient services, followed by pharmacy (13%)
and primary care (13%) [3].
Comparing with drug treatment, non-drug treatments can
be less expensive and can avoid potential side-effects,
which include exercise therapy, acupuncture and Massage
therapy (MT). MT is a widely-used complementary and

alternative therapy in treating LBP. MT is a systematic manipulation of soft tissues with rhythmical pressure and stroking
which contributes to relieving various types of body distress [4]–[6]. MT has been reported to have beneficial effects
on varying conditions including prenatal depression, preterm
infants [7], autism, skin conditions, pain syndromes including
arthiritis and fibromyalgia, hypertension [8], autoimmune
conditions including asthma and multiple sclerosis, immune
conditions including HIV and breast cancer and aging problems including Parkinson’s and dementia [9]. Previous works
focus on massage effect of different parts of the bodies,
such as neck [8], the posterior shoulder area [10], lower
back [5], [11], and foot [12]. For chronic LBP, traditional
Thai massage [5] and Swedish massage [11], [13] have been
reported with the effectiveness in enhancing physical functions, improving disability and range of motion of back and
body flexibility, providing pain relief, reducing anxiety and
improving mood.
Most of the previous effectiveness assessment were based
on subjective routine clinical assessment tools, such as
10-point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score [11], [14] for
assessing immediate effect, the short form McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) for assessing effectiveness of massage [11],
state anxiety inventory (STAI) [14], [15], Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale (HADS), Oswestry Disability Index
(ODI) [5] for disability measurement, and hospital stay [16].
Although these tools have clinical meaning, they are subjective and rough.
Recently, there have been some studies assessing physical and physiological effects of massage, such as blood
pressure [8], [13], [17], heart rate [18], heart rate variability (HRV) in preterm infants [7], respiration rate [15], range
of motion increased [19], electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyography (EMG) [6]. These reports were limited to some
types of patients such as adults with hypertension, healthy
males, or preterm infants.
Electroencephalography (EEG) has very high temporal
resolution compared to function magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). EEG has been used in the comparison between
different massage process, such as massage treatment applied
by hand and treatment applied by mechanical devices [20],
treatment for shoulder pain [21], treatment in females whose
children were diagnosed as attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder [22], or healthy volunteers receiving a mechanical
massage [23]. In the existing studies using EEG to evaluate the effect of MT [18], [21], [24], most analysis focus
on EEG absolute spectral power of four rhythms, such as
delta (0-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta
(13-30 Hz) activity [25]–[28]. Decreases in alpha and beta
are observed during relaxation [9], [18]. However, some
other works’ results were inconsistent with this result. For
instance, Rattanawan et al. [10] found that delta and theta
bands gradually declined while alpha, beta, and gamma bands
increased after shoulder massage. This inconsistency might
exist because of differences in massage technique, treatment time, or operator skill level which are not standardized

between studies [6]. Further research is needed to identify
underlying neurophysiological and biochemical mechanisms
associate with moderate pressure massage [29].
As a statistical measure, entropy can quantify the complexity and detect dynamic change through taking into account
the non-linear behavior of time series [30]. There are many
approaches about entropy applied to physiological signals.
Approximate entropy (ApEn) presented by Pincus [31] is
useable to quantify regularity in data without knowledge
about a system, but it depends heavily on the record length.
Sample Entropy (SampEn) proposed by Richman and Moorman [32] is an improvement of ApEn with respect to computation and accuracy of signal regularity. The advantage
of SampEn is that it is insensitive to missing data. Wavelet
entropy (WaveEn) [30] estimates the complexity of time
series by quantifying the degree of similarity between different fractions of signals and it is an indicator of the
disorder degree associated with the multi-frequency signal
response [30], [33]. Permutation entropy (PE) presented by
Bandt and Pompe [34] has the quality of simplicity, robustness and very low computational cost [35]. Permutation disalignment index (PDI) presented by N. Mammone et al. [36]
can quantify the coupling between two or more time series
(i.e. between two or more different cortical areas). Another
useful entropy method Fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn) presented by
Chen et al. [37] have been shown to have a stronger relative
reliability and more accurate complexity than SampEn. Inherent Fuzzy entropy (IFE) presented by Cao et al. [38]–[40] is
the improved version of FuzzyEn, which used intrinsic mode
functions (IMFs) to eliminate trend oscillations.
However, to the best of our knowledge, little is known
about the quantitative Chinese massage effectiveness based
on entropy features on acute LBP patient compared with
healthy control group. The brain activity variation before and
after massage using different entropy features as indicators
for LDH patients and control group is the main contribution
of this study. We designed a massage therapy experiment
combined with EEG test, and quantified the effectiveness of
Chinese massage therapy for the LBP and healthy groups
using multiple entropy-based EEG features. We also validated the classification for two groups (LDH and control
group) in two states (before and after massage) using ten
different classifiers (see the details in section II). Our study
may provide a quantitative effectiveness assessment method
on EEG complexity for the massage therapy for the LBP
patients.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. SUBJECTS

Twenty-six LDH patients and twenty-four healthy volunteers
participated in the massage experiment. The patients were
recruited from the Longgang District Central Hospital of
Shenzhen, China. The inclusion criteria were: the LDH participants were diagnosed by a clinical magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT); persistent
LBP for at least 3 months, serious enough to require medical

attention or absence from work. Exclusion criteria included:
neurological symptoms, severe cardiovascular diseases, LBP
caused by tumor, acute infection, fracture of the vertebral
column, and spinal surgery. The healthy controls had no
history of LBP requiring medical attention or absence from
work for the last year. None of the healthy subjects had a
history of spine pain or reflected any diseases of the cervical, thoracic, lumbar spine or hip. The study was approved
by the institutional review board of the Shenzhen Institutes
of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences
(SIAT-IRB-170815-H0171) and procedures were in accordance with the latest revision of the declaration of Helsinki.
All subjects provided written informed consent.

B. EXPERIMENT PROCEDURE AND EEG DATA
ACQUISITION

Before the experimental session started, each subject completed a number of questionnaires on personality, pain
assessed with Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and functional
disability assessed by Oswestry Disability Questionnaire
(ODQ). Information of these subjects is given in Table 1.
The experiment procedure was shown in Fig.1. EEG signals were acquired for 3 minutes before and immediately
after massage, respectively. Subjects were asked to close their
eyes, lay prostrate on the massage bed quietly wearing the
EEG headset and refrain from talking, falling asleep, or moving during EEG measurement. The Chinese massage treatments were performed by professional massage therapists,
and it was about 15 minutes for one subject, and acupoints in
participant back and hips were massaged for deep kneading
penetration to relieve subject sore and aching muscle pain.
The EEG was recorded with a hi-resolution 14-channel
mobile EEG devices (Emotiv EPOC+, USA). The electrode
is placed in the 10 ∼ 20 electrode system according to
the international standard. Data of 14 channels EEG signals
(AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, and
AF4) were recorded at a sampling rate of 128 Hz wirelessly
(Fig.2). The resolution is 16 bits.
The Emotiv EPOC+ headset [41]–[52] offers a costeffective solution and has been increasingly employed in
brain-computer interface (BCI) applications such as device

control, gaming, emotion detection, user brain state detection,
robots [41], and motor imagery applications [50]. The Emotiv
EPOC headset shows a good performance when detecting
mental activity with the aim of identifying several mental
actions [51]. Researchers have conducted studies comparing Emotiv with other medical or research grade devices
(medical grade Neuroscan system [43], [46] and g.tec EEG
equipment [44]). Classification percentage, reaction time,
and information transfer rate [45] were used for comparison.
These studies showed that the low-cost wireless Emotiv system could be of comparable quality to research-grade EEG
acquisition equipment as the classification accuracy is not
significantly degraded using this equipment [45], [47].
Furthermore, Emotiv EEG system is a promising tool
for measuring auditory processing in people from special
populations who are unable or unwilling to be tested in an

D. FEATURES EXTRACTION

Eight features had been extracted in this experiment for
the comparison of EEG’s complexity in different groups,
and they were calculated from every 2-sec long EEG epoch
(256 points), every 4-sec long EEG epoch (512 points) and
every 8-sec long EEG epoch (1024 points), respectively.
We calculated eight features for all epoches.
For the LDH group, the numbers of epoches were 269 and
227 for the 1024-point segments before and after massage,
588 and 499 for the 512-points segments before and after
massage, 1219 and 1039 for the 256-point segments before
and after massage. For the healthy controls, the numbers of
epoches were 516 both for the 1024-point segments before
and after massage, 1084 and 1092 for 512-point segments
before and after massage, 2187 and 2206 for 256-point segments before and after massage.
Eight EEG features were briefly introduced as following.

experimental laboratory [43]. Therefore, we chose Emotiv
headset for the LDH patients here.
C. SIGNAL PREPROCESSING

Removal of artifacts is crucial for achieving good EEG decoding performance [53], [54]. Independent component analysis (ICA) does not require any prior information or additional
reference channel for removal of artifacts [55]–[59]. In our
study, we used FastICA algorithm to decompose the signals
into independent components and detected those related to
eye-blinks, heart and muscles electrical activity by visual
inspection, and made the uncontaminated EEG signals reconstructed. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was used for quantitative evaluation of the filtering performance. The averaged
SNR was over 35 dB for the reconstructed signals. The reconstructed EEG was denoised by substracting the mean value
of EEG, as the DC offset in the signals didn’t contain any
information. After baseline correction and artifact rejection,
a band-pass filter of 0.5-40 Hz was applied during recording.
Then we used a wavelet packet named Daubechies 30 as a
filter to denoise the EEG signal. We did the wavelet decomposition and wavelet reconstruction. Four rhythms were derived
from the wavelet reconstruction, which were shown in Fig.3.
Powers of four EEG rhythms were extracted by different
frequency range: delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha
(8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz). Each signal from each channel
was segmented into epochs with time windows 256 points
(2 seconds), 512 points (4 seconds) and 1024 points
(8 seconds), respectively. MATLAB (Mathworks R2014b;
Natick, MA, USA) was used for the data preprocessing and
feature calculation.

In general, a lower value of ApEn reflects a higher degree of
regularity. The algorithm is described as follows:
Step 1: Obtain a time series with N points {X(i), 1 ≤ i ≤
N }. Parameters r and m represent tolerance and embedding
dimension, respectively.
Step 2: The m-dimension template vector Xm (i) is defined
as:
Xm (i) = {X (i), X (i + 1), . . . , X (i + m − 1)}

(1)

where 1 ≤ i ≤ N − m + 1.
Step 3: Set the distance between two vectors:
d[Xm (i), Xm (j)] = max(|Xm (i + k) − Xm (j + k)|)

(2)

where 0 ≤ k ≤ m − 1, i 6= j.
Step 4: For each i ≤ N − m + 1, let Cim (i) be (N − m + 1)−1
times the number of vectors Xjm within r of Xim . Define
8m (r) = (N − m + 1)−1

N −m+1
X

ln Cim (i)

(3)

i=1

where ln is the natural logarithm.
Step 5: ApEn is defined as follows:
ApEn(m, r, N ) = 8m (r) − 8m+1 (r)

(4)

We chose m = 2 and r = 0.2 × std, where std is the
standard deviation of the amplitude values for ApEn.
2) SAMPLE ENTROPY ASSESSMENT

SampEn is calculated as follows [60]. Step 1 to step 3 in
SampEn are the same as step 1 to step 3 of ApEn.
Step 4: let Bi be the number of vectors Xm (j) within r of
Xm (i), then:

In our study, the length N for each epoch was chosen
to be 256 points (2 s), 512 points (4 s) and 1024 points
(8 s), respectively. We initialized SampEn with the following
parameters: m = 2 and r = 0.2 × std.

Xt = [x(t), x(t + L), . . . , x(t + (m − 1)L)]T

(13)

A reshaped version Xrt of the Xt is defined as:

3) HHTMSEn ASSESSMENT

We used the improved method of Hilbert-Huang Transform
Marginal spectrum entropy (HHTMSEn) [61] which combined the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and the
associated Hilbert spectral analysis. EMD is a self-adaptive
approach, making it highly suitable and attractive for
non-linear and non-stationary vibrations signals analysis [62]. EMD decomposes the signals into a set of complete
and nearly orthogonal IMFs, each IMF (ci (t)) corresponding
to the vibration mode of a specific signal at a discrete frequency [63].
Hilbert transform on each ci (t) were performed as follows:

HHTMSEn = −

where pi indicates the probability that the frequency of i
appears [64].
4) NORMALIZED ENERGY ASSESSMENT

Spectral analysis is usually used in many EEG applications.
In our experiment, we calculated normalized energy. We used
the wavelet package db4 for decomposition and reconstruction signal, and then calculated the energy for four rhythms
(delta, theta, alpha, beta bands) and the total energy based
on the power spectrum amplitude and its conjugate complex
number, and normalized four energy using the total energy as
follows.
pi = Ei /E

(11)

where pi denotes the percentage of the energy of the different
band i relative to the total energy.
5) WAVELET ENTROPY ASSESSMENT

The definition of wavelet entropy is given as follows:
X
WaveEn = −
pi ln pi

Xrt = [x(τ1 ), x(τ2 ), . . . , x(τm )]T

(14)

where τi = 1, . . . , m.
Each vector Xt can be mapped into a symbol vector πi =
[τ1 , τ2 , . . . , τm ] (where i = 1, . . . , m!). The occurrence rate of
a given sequence πi for the time series x is denoted as pX (πi ).
The probability of the predetermined symbol (motif) can
be estimated: p(πi ) = n(πi )/(N −(m−1)L), and PE is defined
as
PE(m) = −

m!
X

p(πi ) log(p(πi ))

(15)

i=1

where log is the natural logarithm.
Permutation disalignment index [36] was defined for a new
measure of coupling strength between time series based on
PE. It has been used as an indirect, EEG-based, measure of
brain connectivity in Alzheimer’s Disease and Mild Cognitive
Impaired patients. The coupling strength between the different cortical areas rather than the activity of the single cortical
area are calculated by PDI.
Given two series x and y, the time point t and the lag L,
two series x and y can be projected into the vector Xt and Yt ,
respectively. A simultaneous occurrence rate pX ,Y of each
motif has been estimated, and the symbolic measure of coupling strength PDI between x and y is defined as:
m!
X
1
log[
pX ,Y (πi )α ]
PDI (X , Y ) =
1−α

(16)

i=1

The more coupled x and y are, the lower the PDI is expected
to be. The more details can be found in [36]. For PE and PDI
calculation, we used the basic parameters as follows: α = 2,
m = 3, L = 1. We also used the parameter m = 6 for PE
comparison.
7) FUZZY ENTROPY

(12)

i<0

where pi is the probability distribution of time series, and i
represents different resolution level.
7762

PE [34], [35] calculated the complexity based on comparison
of neighboring values. The advantages of PE method are its
simplicity, extremely fast calculation, robustness, and invariance with respect to nonlinear monotonous transformations.
Given a time series x(t) with N samples, it is mapped
into an m-dimentional space, where m is the embedding
dimension and L is the time lag.

FuzzyEn method [37] is the negative natural logarithm of
the conditional probability that two vectors similar for m
points remain similar for the next m+1 points. In FuzzyEn,
the family of exponential functions as the fuzzy function
are employed to get a fuzzy measurement of two vectors’
similarity based on their shapes.

8) INHERENT FUZZY ENTROPY

IFE applied empirical mode decomposition and fuzzy
membership function (exponential function) to address the
dynamic complexity. In the IFE method, the EMD technique
was applied to decompose the original signal x(t) into several IMFs, and reconstruct the signal. The IMFs components
surviving high trends were automatically removed by a trend
filtering algorithm [65]. The remained IMFs were chosen for
reconstructing signal by cumulative sums of the remained
IMFs. Then, the reconstructed EEG signals were normalized
and used as the input of FuzzyEn. IFE method includes multiscale procedure. For a given time series, multiple coarsegrained time series are constructed by averaging the data

Combining each kind of features for 4 rhythms in 14 channels, we had 56-dimension EEG feature subsets (14 channels

the same group for classification.

E. TEN CLASSIFIERS

Using the calculated features as input to the ten different classifiers, the classifications were implemented and written in
Keras with a Tensorflow backend [66], [67]. We used scikitlearn package and python language for classifiers’ implementation. A 10-fold cross-validation method was used for
validation of training set. Training set was set to 0.75 of the
whole dataset, and the test set was set to 0.25 of the whole
dataset. The parameter of random state was set to 7. The
reference classification procedure is described in detailed in
Fig.1.
We applied ten machine learning methods for testing the
accuracy of classification. These classifiers are support vector

machine (SVM), classification and regression trees (CART),
naive Bayes (NB) classifier, linear discriminant analysis
(LDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), logistic regression
(LR), gradient boosting classifier (GBM), random forest
(RF) (Breiman, 2001) [68], Adaboosting classifier (AB), and
extra trees classifier (ET). SVM is a constructive learning
procedure rooted in statistical learning theory [69]. SVM
shows good performance in solving problems like small sample size [70], as well as being capable of both non-linear
and high-dimensional pattern recognition. In SVM classifier, we selected the linear kernel as kernel function and
C parameter equalled to 2. CART classifier proposed by
Breiman et al. [71] implements an expanded and strengthened
tree-structured approach. It has the advantage of modelling
for complex, non-linear and involved high-order interactions
data [71]. The nonparametric KNN is minimally affected by
the nonstationary of a signal. In KNN classifier, we selected
neighbors as 6. RF classifier is a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random
vector sampled independently and with the same distribution
for all trees in the forest [68]. The generalization error of
a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the
individual trees in the forest and the correlation between
them. Using a random selection of features to split each node
yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost, but
are more robust with respect to noise [68]. AB Classifier
proposed by Freund and Schapire [72] is a method that strategically combines a collection of ‘‘weak’’ classifiers to form a
stronger classifier. Its advantage includes lower memory and
computational requirements [73]. ET classifier implements
a meta estimator that fits a number of randomized decision
trees on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging
to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.
Breiman [74] showed that bagging could effectively reduce
the variance of regression predictors, while leaving the bias
relatively unchanged. GBM, RF, AB and ET classifiers were
used for the bagging algorithms of sklearn package. Unless
we mentioned, other parameters were set using the default
parameters in sklearn package.
The used classifiers have not yet been applied on massage
effectiveness before. The classifications were performed on
two states of massage (before and after massage) and two
groups (LDH group and control group). The report scores of
different classifiers were based on average accuracies, precision, recall, and F1-score. The effectiveness of classification
using different classifiers was validated by the area under the
curve (AUC).
F. STATISTICAL ANALYSES

We performed the statistical analyses with SPSS software,
version 19.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). A p-value ≤ 0.05
was considered statistically significant. ∗∗ and ∗∗∗ denote
significant difference p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively.
Data were expressed in mean ± std. Independent t-test was
also used for comparing the significant difference of different group using different features. Furthermore, intragroup

III. RESULTS
A. COMPARISON OF PERFORMANCES BETWEEN LDH
PATIENTS AND CONTROL GROUP USING EIGHT FEATURES
OF EEG SIGNALS

It was demonstrated that the performance before and after
massage for the LDH group (Fig.4(a)) and control group
(Fig.4(b)) with five features (ApEn, SampEn, HHTMSEn,
Normalized energy, WaveEn) for four rhythms in fourteen
channels of EEG signals. Other three features (PE, FuzzyEn,
IFE) were shown in Fig. 5 (a) and (b) for LDH group and
healthy control group, respectively.
For the LDH group, the ApEn and SampEn features
(Fig.4 (a)) of delta rhythms after massage were less than
the values before massage in all fourteen channels, and
there were significant differences in six channels which were
almost in the left hemisphere. The WaveEn feature (Fig.4 (a))
of the delta and beta rhythm in the LDH group after massage
decreased in ten channels and fourteen channels, respectively.
PE, FuzzyEn and IFE features (Fig.5 (a)) of delta rhythm after
massage were also less than the values before massage in all
fourteen channels. It indicated that the complexity of delta
rhythms of EEG signals in LDH group after massage were
lower than that before massage, with the relief of the pain
after massage therapy. Furthermore, the normalized energy
values of delta rhythm in the LDH group after massage were
higher than the values before massage in thirteen channels,
especially there were significant differences in six channels
in the left hemisphere (Fig. 4 (a)). It indicated that the
energy of delta rhythm was evoked after massage in the
LDH group.
The WaveEn feature of the theta rhythm in the LDH group
increased after massage in seven channels (Fig. 4 (a)). The
HHTMSEn values of theta and beta rhythms in the LDH
group also increased after massage, with the significant differences in three channels (O1, FC6, AF4) in the right hemisphere for theta rhythm and five channels (F7, O1, O2, P8,
AF4) for beta rhythm. The normalized energy values of theta
rhythm and alpha rhythm in the LDH group decreased after
massage in fourteen channels, with significant differences
in ten channels for the theta rhythm and nine channels for
the alpha rhythm (Fig. 4 (a)). The normalized energy of
beta rhythm after massage significant decreased in the left
frontal hemisphere in four channels (AF3, F7, FC5, O1)
(Fig. 4 (a)).
For healthy control group, the ApEn and SampEn values of the delta rhythm increased after massage, especially
with the significant differences in seven channels for ApEn
values and nine channels for SampEn in the right hemisphere (Fig. 4 (b)). The WaveEn features of the delta and
theta rhythms (Fig. 4 (b)) increased after massage in twelve
channels and ten channels, respectively. The PE, FuzzyEn,
and IFE values of the delta rhythm also increased after
VOLUME 8, 2020

massage, with the significant differences in four channels for
PE, twelve channels for FuzzyEn and six channels for IFE
(Fig. 5 (b)). Using the ApEn and SampEn features for the
healthy control group, theta rhythm decreased in left hemisphere and increased in the right hemisphere after massage in
most of the channels, the alpha and beta rhythm decreased
after massage in almost all channels, with the significant
differences in nine channels for the alpha rhythm and four
channels for the beta rhythm, respectively (Fig. 4 (b)).
In the healthy control group, the HHTMSEn values of delta
and theta rhythms increased after massage, with the significant differences in three channels (T7, FC6, F4) for delta
rhythm and three channels (FC6, F8, AF4) for theta rhythm.
Moreover, the HHTMSEn values of alpha and beta rhythms
in the healthy controls after massage decreased in almost
all channels, with significant differences in three channels
(T7, P7, T8) for the alpha rhythm and nine channels for the
beta rhythm, respectively (Fig. 4 (b)). The normalized energy
values of delta rhythm in the healthy control group increased
after massage in four channels in the left frontal region
(Fig. 4 (b)). The normalized energy values of theta rhythm
and alpha rhythm increased in fourteen channels, with significant differences in seven channels for the theta rhythm and ten
channels for the alpha rhythm. The normalized energy of beta
rhythm after massage decreased significantly in six channels
(F7, F3, T7, P7, O2, T8), which is mostly in the left frontal
hemisphere.
In the healthy control group, the WaveEn values of the
alpha rhythm decreased after massage in fourteen channels,
with significant differences in ten channels. The WaveEn values of the beta rhythm increased after massage in nine channels, with significant differences in four channels. FuzzyEn
and IFE features (Fig.5 (b)) of alpha rhythm significantly
increased after massage, while PE of alpha rhythm significantly decreased after massage. In the left hemisphere,
PE and IFE of beta rhythm decreased after massage.

B. ACCURACIES OF CLASSIFICATION OF GROUPS (LDH
VS CONTROL GROUP) OR TWO STATES (BEFORE AND
AFTER MASSAGE) IN ONE GROUP

We use 56-dimension features (4 rhythms∗ 14 channels) for
epochs in two groups or in two states as classifier’s input, and
ten classifiers were used. The averaged classified accuracy
of classification between different group (LDH vs control
group) were summarized in Table 2 with different epoch
length (1024, 512, and 256 points per epoch). The accuracies
varied from 86.57% to 100% for different classifiers in identification between patients and control group. The accuracies
are all higher than 80% and are acceptable. SVM, CART, NB,
LDA, LR, GBM and AB reached the highest accuracies for
identifying two groups (LDH and control group) in two states
(before or after massage). The lowest accuracy is 86.57%
based on KNN classifier using the WaveEn features before
massage. The best classifier accuracy with the KNN classifier
can achieve 91.4% if we chose the k equaling to 25.

used for control group reached the lowest accuracies, with
accuracies 55.14%-69.38%. WaveEn feature had been shown
to be less accurate than other features for the classification

of control group before or after massage. The KNN classifier
using IFE features reached high accuracies for both LDH and
control group.

C. EEG TOPOMAP FOR LDH GROUP AND CONTROL
GROUP

As the SampEn feature in different classifier can reach high
accuracy for two states’ classification, we chose the SampEn to plot the topomap. To show the difference between
the topomap before and after massage for LDH group and
control group, we did the normalization to make the topomap
values between the maximum and minimum value of SampEn
value for each subgroup. Fig. 6 (a), (b), and (c) showed
that topomaps for the four rhythms in LDH group before
and after massage using SampEn feature in different epoch
length (1024 points, 512 points, and 256 points per epoch
respectively). The different epoch length affects little on the
topomaps using SampEn features. The topomaps for the four
rhythms in LDH group after massage in three different epoch
length all showed less complex with lower SampEn value
than that before massage, especially in the left side of brain.
It indicated that there was little effect in the topomaps using
SampEn feature in three different epoch length (1024 points,
512 points, and 256 points).
Fig. 7 (a), (b) and (c) showed that topomaps for the four
rhythms in control group before and after massage using
SampEn features (1024, 512 and 256 points per epoch,
respectively). The topomaps of delta and theta rhythms after
massage showed more complexity with higher SampEn value
7770

than that before massage, while the alpha and beta rhythms
after massage showed less complexity than that before massage. For the control group, it indicated that subjects felt
relaxation after massage. Furthermore, there was similar
topomap for the different epoch length for control group.
There was little effect in the topomaps using SampEn feature
in different epoch length (1024, 512, and 256 points per
epoch).
D. PDI SCORES FOR FOUR RHYTHMS OF LDH GROUP
AND CONTROL GROUP IN 13 INTER-CHANNELS

Fig. 8 (a) and (b) showed the PDI scores before and after
massage in 13 inter-channels for LDH and control group.
The mean value of PDI scores in 13 inter-channels after
massage were all significantly lower than that before massage
in LDH group. It indicates that coupling strength between
the different cortical areas in LDH were higher after massage
than that before massage.
Fig. 9 (a) and (b) showed the PDI scores for four rhythms of
LDH and control group in 13 inter-channels. The PDI scores
of three rhythms (theta, alpha and beta) were significantly
lower after massage than that before massage in LDH. The
PDI scores of four rhythms were significantly higher than that
before massage in control group.
IV. DISCUSSION

The current study investigated the similarity and differences
in brain activity variation resulting from massage for LDH
VOLUME 8, 2020

H. Li et al.: Effectiveness Assessment of MT Using Entropy-Based EEG Features

FIGURE 7. Control group’s four rhythms’ topomaps before and after massage (using SampEn features in average in the same subgroup, 1024 points per

patient group and healthy group using different entropy features as indicators. We also investigated the accuracies to
differentiate the inner group and inter-group before and after
massage.
From Fig. 4 to Fig. 5, we found that the normalized energy
of delta rhythm in the LDH group showed higher values
after massage than that before massage in thirteen channels, and the normalized energy of theta and alpha rhythm
showed lower values after massage than that before massage
in fourteen channels. Furthermore, the values of beta rhythm
after massage were significantly lower than the values before
massage in the left hemisphere both in LDH group and control group. These results were consistent with the previous
study [18], [20], [21], [9], in which Diego showed that massage groups treated by professional technicians had significantly decreased alpha and beta waves on the frontal lobe
with the moderate massage [18]. R. C. Luo et al. [27] proposed a robotics therapeutic massage evaluation system using
EEG signal analysis approach and also found an increase
in delta power and a decrease in alpha power which represents the relaxation response of subjects. Furthermore, our
results were consistent with the previous study [75] which
showed that frontal EEG asymmetry was significantly attenuated after the massage for depressed adolescents. As all we
know, some LDH patients easily became depressed because
of the long-term pain. Massage could alleviate the depression. Moreover, the normalized energy of delta rhythm in
VOLUME 8, 2020

the control group showed higher values in theta and alpha
rhythms and lower values in beta rhythm after massage than
that before massage. These results were consistent with the
previous study [18] with the light massage which indicated
the increased arousal.
Comparing the differences in brain activity resulting from
massage for LDH patient group and healthy group, the ApEn,
SampEn, WaveEn, PE, FuzzyEn, and IFE features of the delta
rhythm in LDH group significantly decreased after massage
while the same features of the delta rhythm in the control
group increased significantly after massage. Furthermore,
the ApEn and SampEn features of alpha and beta rhythms
in the control group significantly decreased in the left hemisphere after massage. It is suggested that LDH group and
healthy controls had different level of relaxation. It indicated
that after massage treatment, LDH group evoked more change
in delta rhythm than healthy control group, and more comfortable feeling than healthy control group. LDH group came
into the relaxation state, and the healthy group came into the
relaxation state and conscious state.
The HHTMSEn values of theta rhythm increased after
massage both in LDH group and control group. However,
the HHTMSEn values of alpha and beta rhythm increased
significantly in the left hemisphere after massage in LDH
group, while the values of alpha and beta rhythm significantly
decreased after massage in control group. The WaveEn feature of theta rhythm increased and the WaveEn feature of

alpha rhythm decreased after massage both in LDH group
and healthy controls. However, the WaveEn values of delta
and beta rhythms after massage were lower than the values
before massage in LDH group, while the WaveEn values of
delta and beta rhythms after massage were higher than the
values before massage in control group.
In Table 2, it was shown that seven classifiers achieved
high accuracies of identification using eight features for LDH
group and healthy group with different length of segments
(1024 points, 512 points and 256 points per epoch). ApEn,
SampEn, Normalized energy, FuzzyEn and IFE showed more
accuracies of identification than the WaveEn features’ accuracies for two groups. PE with m = 3 showed better performance than PE with m = 6. In Table 3, it was shown
that ten classifiers except KNN and LDA classifiers achieved
high accuracies of identification using eight features for
classifying two status (before and after massage) in both
groups with different length of segments. We could come
to a conclusion that these features had strong robustness in
classifying two groups before and after massage. IFE feature outperformed other features when using KNN classifiers
(Table 4).
7772

The four rhythms’ topomaps showed that the SampEn of
delta, theta, alpha and beta rhythms were almost lower after
massage than that before massage in left brain regions with
three different lengths per epoch (Fig. 6). The decreasing
of SampEn of EEG signals in 56 channels in LDH group
after massage probably were attributed to the relaxation and
pain relief after massage, especially in left brain region. For
the control group, the averaged complexity of alpha and
beta rhythms was lower after massage in hindbrain regions
(Fig. 7). It was also shown that using different length of
epoch, four rhythms’ topomaps before and after massage had
little changed, indicating robust performance.
Fig.9 showed that PDI values of theta, alpha, delta rhythms
were significantly decreased after massage in LDH group.
On the contrary, PDI values increased significantly after massage in the control group. These results indicated that PDI
resulted sensitive to the massage therapy in two groups.
V. CONCLUSION

Our results showed that the normalized energy of delta
rhythm for LDH group significantly increased in the left
hemisphere after massage, and the normalized energy of
VOLUME 8, 2020

H. Li et al.: Effectiveness Assessment of MT Using Entropy-Based EEG Features

theta and alpha rhythm significantly decreased after massage. ApEn, SampEn, WaveEn, PE, FE, and IFE features of
the delta rhythm in LDH group became smaller after massage, which indicated a relief of pain and low complexity of
EEG signals. The accuracies of six classifiers (SVM, CART,
NB, LR, GBM, AB) using eight features (ApEn, SampEn,
WaveEn, HHTMSEn, normalized energy, PE, fuzzy entropy,
IFE) for LDH patients and HC group before and after massage reached high accuracies in average. It indicated that
the eight features of EEG rhythms and PDI score could be
promising indices of the effectiveness of massage for LDH
patients. Rhythm SampEn scalp topography in two groups
before and after massage were investigated and showed the
significant different complexity change between two states
(before massage and after massage) in one group.
