Abstract—Most people who suffer from physical and sensory
disabilities have limited activities. They need communication
tools to facilitate communication activities with others. The
purpose of this research is to create an application that
translates thoughts to text which will be implemented in SMS
feature by taking raw EEG from Emotiv EPOC, filtering, and
applying machine learning algorithm, which is Support Vector
Machine. There are two research steps: analysis and
implementation. In the analysis step, the EEG samples taken
from respondents are used for analyzing the most dominant
channel. Then, EEG signal extraction uses Emotiv EPOC SDK,
filters EEG signal taken from the most dominant channel and
applies SVM algorithm for data training. C# based UI
application is used as interactive media, so user can see the
extraction result. The result of this research is an application
that translates human thoughts to SMS.
Index Terms—EEG, Emotiv, Support Vector Machine, Brain

I. INTRODUCTION
In the last few years, technology has improved in a significant
way along with the improvement of culture and people. These
technologies are often used to solve problems which occurr
in the life of human, starting from simple problem to a more
complex one. As an example, the technology is used in health
industries for a specialized or disabled person; it is the
development of the application to translate brainwaves into
texts. These technologies may not run without Brain
Computer Interface (BCI), which is maintained in the last
couple of years.
According to Vallabhaneni, Wang, and He [1], “Braincomputer interface is a communication method which moves
according to neural brain activities and independent from the
normal output of muscle”. Communication technology using
BCI is one of the important factors to create an application
that takes brainwaves by interaction between a user and a
system outside keyboard (Van Erp, Lotte, and Tangermann
[2]). The signal produced from brain’s neuron is recorded,
processed, and produced as an instrument for the computer
system.
The application which translates human’s brainwaves into
texts is developed using library Emotiv SDK for developing
control system. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as

machine learning, with hope it can extract the result in a fast
response.

Some of the previous researches look into the applications
that use EEG: Wahed, Islam, and Biswas [3] study a letter
recognition system with FFT, statistical analysis and wavelet
analysis as the most dominant feature. Another research is
from Michahial, Ranjith, Hemath and Puneeth [4], with
speech synthesizer and feature extraction using Euclidian
distance and neural network. These researches are used as our
based to conduct our own research and implementation to
send messages using EEG.
The main purpose of this research is to create an
application that translates brainwaves into texts with fast data
extraction, and to implement it into SMS features.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
This research has 2 main components which are the use of
neuroheadset as media to record EEG signal from user, and a
desktop application to store EEG signal from neuroheadset.
Figure 1 is a block diagram that contains raw EEG
acquiring, raw EEG preprocessing, training, classification
and implementation. For raw EEG acquiring, we use
neuroheadset which is connected with desktop application.
The result of EEG taking will be processed by using digital
signal processing and applying statistical analysis. Then, it
will be implemented into machine learning for training step
and classification.

A. EEG Signal Acquisition
In this research, the scientist use Emotiv Epoc Research
Edition SDK [5] to obtain 14 EEG channels with sampling
rate of 128 Hz. Emotiv Epoc Research Edition SDK provides
access to raw EEG signal data, so that scientist can process
the obtained signal. Furthermore, Emotiv Epoc Research
Edition SDK also provides easy to use classes to detect
brainwave, facial expression, eye motion, and emotion level.
The scientist uses pariental brain, which contains imagination
and memory, to obtain raw EEG signal data.
B. Digital Raw EEG Signal Processing
In processing raw EEG signal data, the researcher uses the
digital signal processing [6]. The results are used as the input
for machine learning. Emotiv Epoc Research Edition SDK
contains 128 Hz sampling rate in every channel. For optimal
signal quality, the theory of Nyquist and Shannon are often
used, because the sampling rate can be expanded into 2 times
from the frequency analog signal, which is converted into
discrete signal. This expansion to 2 times of frequency analog
signal is used to decrease the occurrence of bad effects and
aliasing. After the analog signal is converted into a discrete
signal, then filter to unneeded frequency using bandpass filter
is needed. Bandpass filter is a filter that allows signal inside
a frequency range. In this research, the researcher uses alpha
and beta wave in range of 8 Hz to 32 Hz.
Because Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) assumes frequency
periodically, every discontinuity between the first sample and
the last sample that is repeated causes an after effect spectrum
or spectral leakage. To reduce the problems, the researcher
uses the windowing function [7], which is the hann
windowing to reduce the spectral leakage by softening the
result in every discontinuity frequency. Results from FFT are
used as an input data to decide features for statistical analysis:
• Max value
Compare the highest value from EEG signal in every
letter.
• Mean
Obtain average score of data in every chosen channel
in a letter.

where, m as starting index, P as last index from data,
N=(p-m) as total data.
The usage of statistical analysis is to increase the accuracy
in character classification, because with only FFT, the pattern
which is obtained is not enough to gain a dominant accuracy
in character classification.
C. Classification using SVM
The researcher uses support vector machine algorithm as
machine learning. In general, SVM [8] will find the best
hyperplane which function as a divider to 2 class between
input areas. In this research, the researcher is trying to find

some of the best channels that are used as a deciding factor in
character classifier. The candidate channels are P8, T7, T8,
O1, O2 and FC6.
The best channel is obtained from the result of EEG signal
that is processed through FFT. The signal result can be seen
from linearly separable method, so that conclusion can be
made on which is the candidate channel for character
classifiers.
III. RESULT AND DISCUSSION
In this research, the researcher uses EEG data with
sampling rate 128 Hz with 14 channels in 100ms. In 100ms,
the system records 48 sample data for every character.
Emotiv EPOC Research Edition SDK provides classes that
can be used to access raw EEG signals. The researcher uses
only EEG signals to recognize letters. Bandpass filtering,
windowing function, FFT, statistical analysis and SVM as
machine learning are also used in this research as character
classifier method (supervised learning).
In this research, the researcher concludes to use only 1
channel for character classifier. This channel is decided from
the result of EEG signal that has been processed through FFT.
Figure 2 is the result of EEG signal filtered by FFT.
Determining the best channel is seen as a linearly separable
method with data test results. In the early test using 2 and 3
channels at the same time, the accuracy obtained is only 2030%. Then the researcher tries testing with 1 channel. After a
few tests, the researcher decides to use P8 channel, because
this channel provides a better accuracy than the other
channels.

user. This research is tested on 5 respondents; each of them
has different age, gender and disability, including the
environment condition from quiet to noisy. Each 5
respondents is tested 5 times, with each testing tests on 10
characters at random. For every character, the respondents
must imagine that they are writing the character according to
visual image.
Table 2 and 3 show results of user testing by implementing
only FFT and the combination of FFT and statistical analysis.
The test results show that statistical analysis improved
character accuracy from 29.6% to 59.2%.

IV. CONCLUSION
From the research results, the application development uses
only EEG signal, and the channel used is only P8. Results of
raw EEG signals are processed into digital signal processing:
bandpass filter, windowing function and FFT. FFT results are
implemented into statistical analysis to obtain more accurate
results. The use of P8 channel is obtained from series of tests
which are analyzed by the linearly separable method for every
EEG signal that has been processed through FFT. From the

test results, only uses FFT will earn 29.6% of accuracy. Using
FFT and Statistical Analysis will earn accuracy 59.2%. To
obtain a better accuracy, the user is needed to be focused. The
user’s mental condition also needs to be fit.
For future research, a research on other channels in
neuroheadset should be conducted, and the wavelet analysis
method should be adopted for better accuracy. It is stated in
the research (Wahed, Islam, & Biswas [3]) that the use of
wavelet analysis has higher accuracy results than FFT and
statistical analysis. Other machine learning algorithm should
also be used to increase the speed and accuracy for classifier,
and the audio headset should also be used to help focus on the
visual usage.
