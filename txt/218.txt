ABSTRACT

We examine if EEG-based cognitive load (CL) estimation is
generalizable across the character, spatial pattern, bar graph
and pie chart-based visualizations for the n-back task. CL
is estimated via two recent approaches: (a) Deep convolutional neural network [2], and (b) Proximal support vector
machines [15]. Experiments reveal that CL estimation suffers
across visualizations motivating the need for effective machine
learning techniques to benchmark visual interface usability for
a given analytic task.

INTRODUCTION

A picture is worth a thousand words– this aphorism reflects
the importance of Information Visualization (InfoViz), which
augments human analytical reasoning to solve complex realworld problems [8]. A key requirement of visual interfaces is
that they should augment human perception while minimizing
cognitive/mental workload, which denotes the amount of mental resources expended during task performance. Cognitive
load can be categorized as either natural or extraneous [4].
In the InfoViz context, natural cognitive load is inherently
imposed by the task on hand, while extraneous cognitive load
depends on the visualization. Since visual interfaces are required to support exploratory analytics and provide insights,
the use of usability heuristics or design questionnaires is unsuitable for evaluating interactive visualization interfaces (or
Viz UIs) [10, 12].

Figure 1: Problem Statement: Under varying mental workload levels induced by the n-back task, we examined if there
was any similarity in user cognitive behavior captured via EEG
across four visualizations. Figure shows (from left to right)
exemplar character, position, bar and pie visualizations.
Neuroergonomics, which examines human factors via neuroscientific methods, presents a viable alternative for evaluating
Viz UIs. Lately, Viz evaluation via cognitive sensing has been
achieved by studying eye movement [6, 9, 11], EEG [1, 3, 15]
or fNIRS [10] activity patterns with light-weight, wireless devices [15]. While being able to reliably measure cognitive load,
these methods are nevertheless task plus visualization specific
and non-generalizable [7]. This work examines if a single
EEG framework can effectively assess (extraneous) memory
workload across multiple visual interfaces under similar task
difficulty. If cognitive load estimation (CLE) is generalizable,
it would naturally enable Viz UI evaluation from neural data.
Alternatively, a smart Viz UI could improve its current visualization with a potentially more intuitive one upon detecting
high user workload.
CLE generalizability has brightened with the success of deep
convolutional neural networks (deep CNNs), which robustly
learn problem-specific features and adapt effectively with minimal additional training [13]. We examined if user EEG responses obtained for the character, spatial pattern, bar graph
and pie chart visualizations under different mental workload
levels induced by the n-back task [2, 7, 10, 15] had any similarities (Figure 1). In lieu of learning a unified CLE model,
we learned Viz-specific CLE models which were evaluated

on (EEG data compiled for) other Viz types. We employed
two state-of-the-art algorithms: deep CNN [2], and proximal
SVM (pSVM) [15]. Experiments suggest that (a) both models
perform well when the train and test data are of the same Viz
type, with pSVM outperforming deep CNN; and (b) the deep
CNN achieves better CLE across Viz types, even if CLE performance deteriorates in such conditions. Our contributions
are outlined on the left.

Figure 2: Protocol timeline with 1-back exemplars.
Contributions: As a first step towards examining CLE generalizability, we examined if there were similarities among
the cognitive processes elicited by four different visualizations
during n-back, based on EEG signals captured by a wireless
headset. Wireless sensors suffer from low signal fidelity, but
are more ecologically valid with respect to lab devices as they
are convenient to use, enabling a non-intrusive and naturalistic
user experience.
Hypotheses

Based on the experimental design, our hypotheses were as
follows:
1. N-back is more challenging with bar and pie: This is because users had to infer the measure of interest in the two
slides via spatial and arithmetic inference before comparing
for bar and pie, while char and pos required only a symbol/spatial pattern comparison. We posited that the challenge in n-back for bar and pie would reflect via response
times and accuracies observed for the four Viz types.
2. User performance will decrease for higher n-back: In
spite of char and pos comparisons being easier than bar
and pie, we nevertheless expected that (a) user performance
would decrease for all Viz types with higher cognitive load
(2 and 3-back), and (b) this should reflect via cognitive sensing such that EEG-based categorization of low/high mental
workload should be facile irrespective if the Viz type.
3. Cognitive processes for the char-pos and bar-pie Viz pairs
should be similar: Following Hypothesis 1, even if the
cognitive processes corresponding to the four Viz types are
dissimilar, we still expected some compatibility between
the CLE models for char and pos, and those for pie and bar
given task similarity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Stimuli, users and protocol: We employed the four Viz types
shown in Fig.1 in our study. These Viz types have been used
previously [2, 10, 15], and an n-back task on these Viz types

is designed to utilize the visual sensory pathway and working
memory. Each char stimulus comprised one of sixteen characters (selected randomly) centered on the screen, while each
pos stimulus was a 3 × 3 spatial grid with one of nine blocks
highlighted. The bar and pie stimuli were generated from reallife rainfall data from January to April. Bar graphs depicted
raw rainfall levels (marked in cm), while pie charts encoded
these values as percentages. 20 graduate students (11 male,
age 24.4±2.1) with normal or corrected vision took part in our
study, which was approved by the local ethics committee.
The standard n-back design (Fig.2) was used over 24 blocks
constituting a user session. Within each block, users were
presented with a series of slides, and needed to compare the
current slide s with the s−nth slide to make a yes or no decision
where n ranged between 0–3. 0-back required comparison
with a pre-defined value/pattern. For char and pos, we asked
if a letter/position matched with n slides before. For pie and
bar, we asked whether a specific measurement (e.g., rainfall
in March) was greater than n slides ago. As bar and pie
charts are designed to use human visuospatial ability, values
to compare had to be inferred by users from the pie and bar
graphs. Identical colors were used to encode the bar and
pie charts. Users recorded responses via a radio button and
to minimize fatigue, each user session was split into two 30
minute halves. Each block contained 12 slides from one Viz
type and each user session comprised 288 presentations (2
halves/session × 12 blocks/half × 12 slides/block).

Table 1: ANOVA summary for RTs and RAs. df denotes
degrees of freedom and * denotes significance at p < 0.01.
The timeline within each block is as shown in Fig.2. Following
a 500 ms fixation cross, the display duration of each successive
slide was set to 2s for char/pos, and 4s for bar/pie slides.
Longer display times for bar and pie were set as users needed
to infer measures of interest via spatial and arithmetic means,
unlike a mere symbol/pattern comparison for char and pos.
Users had to record their responses within a 10s limit and each
instance involving a user response is denoted as a trial. Of the
24 blocks, 12 were designed to be 0 or 1-back, while the other
12 were 2 and 3-back. The order of Viz types was randomized
and the number of 0/1/2/3-back blocks remained identical
across users. Our study employed a 4×4 within-subject design
involving two factors– the n-back level (0,1,2,3 back) and the
Viz type (char, pos, bar, pie). Users’ neural activity was
recorded via the 14-channel Emotiv wireless EEG device as
they performed the experiment (no subjective impressions
were collected).
Our hypotheses and ANOVA analyses of user responses in
the form of response times (RTs) and response accuracies
(RAs) are presented on the left. Supporting H1, user responses

were much faster for char and pos in 0 and 1-back, while
RTs for all four Viz types become very comparable from 2back onwards (Fig.3). Increasing RT with n-back type reveals
that task difficulty increases with n due to greater load on
working memory. A two-way ANOVA on RTs revealed the
main effect of Viz type, n-back type and their interaction effect
(Table 1). Consistent with H2(a), there was a steady decline
in user performance with increasing n-back. Close-to-ceiling
performance was noted with pos and char for 0 and 1-back,
whereas less than 80% accuracy was noted for pie even for
0-back. RAs considerably decreased across Viz types for 2
and 3-back, and an ANOVA on RAs revealed the main effect
of Viz type and n-back level (Table 1).
User behavioral data clearly validate Hypotheses 1 and 2(a).
The challenge posed by n-back with bar and pie is reflected
via higher response times, and sharply lower accuracies for
these Viz types (Fig.3). Char and pos visualizations appear
comparable and result in very similar RTs and RAs. However,
bar graphs seem to be more easy to interpret (reflected via
significantly higher RAs) than pie charts even as corresponding
RTs only differ slightly. Our results agree with [5] which
poses an estimation task, but differ from [10] which poses a
comparison task to find that bar-pie performance differences
are user-specific than holistic.
EEG-BASED CLE: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We recorded EEG data via the wireless 14-channel Emotiv
EPOC headset. EEG data is contaminated by various noise
sources (power-line noise, muscle and eye movement based
artifacts). Upon (i) removing corrupt EEG recordings, (ii)
band-pass filtering the EEG signal to within 0.1–45 Hz and
(iii) visually removing noisy signal components post Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to remove muscular, head
and eye movement artifacts, we extracted two second epochs
from the period immediately preceding user response from
each trial. We then estimated CLE with EEG data employing
the deep CNN [2] and proximal SVM [15] based algorithms.
The key difference between the deep CNN and pSVM methods is that topography maps preserving spatial and spectral
EEG structure are input to the deep CNN (with structure similar to the VGG architecture [14]) in [2], while pSVM [15]
learns from a vectorized, maximum relevance and minimum
redundancy feature set identified via an information theoretic
approach.

with labeled epochs for one Viz type, and tested them with
epochs for another Viz type. Classification was performed
in a user-independent setting, and given the varying epoch
counts for each n-back condition (due to n-back design and
noise removal (Table 2)), we employed F1-score as our performance metric. Table 3 presents mean F1 scores achieved
with 10-fold cross validation. Within-Viz results are denoted
in blue along the table diagonal and the highest F1 score obtained across n-back categorizations for a given Viz pair is
denoted in bold. For both algorithms, the best F1-score in
13 of the 16 conditions corresponds to low vs high cognitive
load categorization, validating Hypothesis 2(b) and implying
that coarse-grained benchmarking of mental workload is more
feasible than fine-grained differentiation. Comparing the maximum within-Viz F1-scores, we find that pSVM outperforms
deep CNN. Also, cross-Viz n-back categorization is inferior to
within-Viz, particularly for pSVM. This suggests (a) possible
EEG signal differences, and consequently EEG features obtained for the four Viz types, and (b) the pSVM method which
performs vector classification is unable to effectively deal with
these differences. Cross-viz results achieved with structurepreserving deep CNN are relatively robust. Also, observed
results only provide limited support to H3 that the cognitive
processes for the char-pos and bar-pie pairs may be similar.
Overall, these results call for more research towards generalized CLE benchmarking, specifically motivating the need to
encode brain activations more efficiently and robustly, even
while conveying that available tools hold some promise in this
direction.
