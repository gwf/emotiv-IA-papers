Abstract
This article presents a summary of research conducted between 2014 and 2018 regarding the
possibility of a distant mental interaction between pairs of sensorially isolated subjects. A total of
85 experimental sessions were completed, during which the EEGs of each subject of the pair
were recorded (respectively called “Sender” and “Receiver”), all while the Sender was given a
series of light and auditory stimuli of one second duration. Members of the pairs knew each other
well and were also experienced in relaxation and meditation techniques. The cerebral response to
a series of stimuli is well known and is called the ERP (Event Related Potential), but the aim of
this study was to look for a possible – presumably weak – response also in the Receiver.
Specifically, we studied the possibility of applying a frequency modulated stimulus (from 10 to
18 Hz) in accordance with the Steady-State method and observing any possible distant response
to the same frequency. The overall evaluation of all the experimental sessions was carried out
using the Global Synchrony (GS) analysis, which effectively allowed us to observe a weak but
important and totally unconscious response in the Receiver (P = 0.001), coinciding with the
stimulus given to the Sender. While the normal ERP response of directly stimulated subjects
(Sender) caused an average increase in the GS by about 12-18%, in the non-stimulated subjects
(Receiver) this average increase was about 0.5%.
Although very weak, this effect appears to truly be associated with information transfer between
two people outside any normal means of sensory communication. These results are discussed and
an experimental procedure is suggested for the actual transfer of information (stimulus
frequency) between the two subjects of a pair, similar to digital binary information. This type of
research is deemed fundamentally important in understanding the nature of Consciousness, based
on a general model of “entanglement” between two minds.
Keywords: mind-to-mind, interaction, EEG, ERP, steady-state potentials, mental entanglement,
consciousness.
This article presents the overall results of research conducted in the last few years (2014 to 2018)
by the authors together with other researchers regarding the study of a possible distant mental
interaction (mind-to-mind) between two sensorially isolated, but mentally and emotionally
connected, people.

The possibility that the electrical activity of two brains can display a correlation in the absence of
any normal sensory connection has been the subject of at least thirty studies (see Table S1 in
Giroldini et al, 2016) and many of these have reported a significant correlation.
Amongst specific studies using EEG and Magnetic Resonance (MRI) we cite Wackermann et al.
(2003), Achterberg et al. (2005), Ambach et al. (2008), Manolea (2015), Persinger et al. (2010),
Radin (2004), Richards et al. (2005) and Standish et al. (2003). These studies are important
because they can contribute to a better understanding of the nature of Consciousness, which
involves aspects of neurophysiology, biochemistry, psychology, and quantum physics, as well as
philosophical aspects.
The studies described herein were carried out by recording the EEG of each pair of participants,
in which the Sender was given a light and sound stimulus lasting one second, while the Receiver
was relaxed and totally isolated from the Sender.
An initial study (Giroldini et al, 2016) highlighted a distinct increase in the Receiver’s brain
coherence (or synchrony) coinciding with the sensory stimuli given to the Sender. This result has
been independently confirmed by Radin (2017).
A second study (Giroldini et al, 2018) used Steady-State stimuli modulated to frequencies of 10
Hz, 12 Hz, 14 Hz, 15 Hz, and 18 Hz, and even this study has shown a significant increase in the
Receiver’s cerebral synchrony to the same stimulation frequency of the Sender. Both of these
studies were also analyzed with a new software program created by the author G.W. and based on
the GW6 method described in Giroldini et. al (2016b), herein called Global Synchrony.

Materials and Methods
Participants
A total of thirty adults – 15 women and 15 men – ranging in age from 30 to 70, took part in the
studies. The primary criteria for their inclusion were their mutual familiarity (friends, spouses,
etc) and their knowledge of basic relaxation and/or meditation techniques. All volunteers were
informed of the experiments’ aims. Furthermore, most of them were firm believers of the
existence of “psychic abilities” and this belief could have enhanced their mental connection.
Equipment
To avoid any kind of electrical connection between the Sender and Receiver, the EEG recordings
were made using two 14 channels Emotiv Epoc devices, each linked via a wireless 2.4 GHz
connection to a dedicated laptop computer powered by its own battery. The Emotiv Epoc has two
efficient digital notch filtres at 50 Hz and 60 Hz to guard against disturbances in the electricity
network. The sample frequency on each channel is 128 samples/sec. This frequency is more than
enough to allow an analysis of all the EEG frequencies among 0.5 Hz and 42 Hz (from Delta to
Gamma1).
In the 2014-2015 experiments, the 14 channels were connected to the AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7,
O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, AF4 locations using the standard version Emotiv Epoc.

Giroldini, W., & Pederzoli, L., Brain-to-Brain Interaction at a Distance Based on EEG Analysis

In the 2016 experiments however, Bionen (Florence, Italy) professional EEG headsets were used
to increase recorded signal quality. Each headset was connected to an Emotiv Epoc by a multicontact connector after having completely disassembled the device (Fig 1 and 2), placing the
electronics into a designated plastic container.
This time the chosen channels were: Fp1, F3, C3, O1, F7, T5, Fp2, F4, C4, P4, O2, F8 e T6. In
2014-2015 the auditory stimulus was a 500 Hz continuous sinusoidal sound administered for one
second through two 32 ohm earbuds inserted into the ears, at a volume of about 80 dB. This
sound was inaudible beyond half a metre away, therefore could not have reached the isolated
Receiver in another room.
A simultaneous one second visual stimulus was given with an array of 16 high luminosity red
LEDs 50 cm away from the Sender, whose eyes were closed, since the light was visible through
the eyelids.
In the two experiments conducted in 2016 the simultaneous one-second auditory and visual
stimuli were on-off modulated at three frequencies, 10 Hz, 12 Hz, and 14 Hz (duty cycle = 50%),
using an audio carrier frequency of 900 Hz.
This method of stimulus administration, called Steady-State (Pastor et al. 2003, Ahn et al. 2016),
was deemed potentially favourable because it allowed the EEG signal to be filtred in a narrow
band around the stimulus frequency to improve the signal/noise ratio. In the two experiments
carried out in Florence in 2014-2016 the members of each pair were placed at a distance of 5
metres from each other in two sound-proof rooms.
In the other two experiments done in Milan in 2016, one room was divided into two separate
areas, with the subjects 8 metres apart. In this case the sound and light stimuli frequencies were
on-off modulated at 15 and 18 Hz; furthermore, only the Receiver’s EEG was recorded to
simplify the experiment, since the focus was to determine if the Receiver displayed a significant
signal corresponding to the stimulus given to the Sender.
The perfect synchronisation of the two Emotiv Epocs’ EEG recordings was considered extremely
important. To this end, specific software was developed to manage the data acquired from the
two independent computers, one of which acted as “master” and gave the command for the
Sender’s sensory stimulation. The “master” simultaneously sent digital information to the second
computer about the start and end of the stimulus, via a shielded serially connected cable.
Despite an electrical connection between the two computers, the two EEG Emotiv Epocs were
guaranteed to be completely electrically isolated from each other, and therefore also each
member of the pair.

Data acquisition in the two computers was synchronous to an accuracy greater than 1/128 s.

Procedure
In the experiment carried out in Florence (Italy) in 2014-2015, the Sender was given 128
continuous (non-modulated) stimuli of one second each, at random intervals of 4 to 6 seconds.
In the 2016 Florence experiment, the Sender was given three groups of 32 random stimuli, on-off
modulated at 10 Hz, 12 Hz, and 14 Hz; the three groups of 32 stimuli were separated by random
intervals ranging from 20 to 30 s, while the stimuli were all separated by the same interval of 4 s.
In another two experiments conducted in Milan in 2016, the Sender was given 100 stimuli, onoff modulated at 15 Hz, and from 90 to 100 stimuli modulated at 18 Hz, separated by random
intervals of between 4 and 6 seconds. Only the Receiver’s EEG was recorded.
In all cases, the participants were in a relaxed state on comfortable armchairs and the Receiver in
particular was instructed to maintain minimal body movement and, if possible, to hold a mental
image of the Sender.

Giroldini, W., & Pederzoli, L., Brain-to-Brain Interaction at a Distance Based on EEG Analysis

EEG signal analysis was performed using a new independent software programme created by coauthor GW in order to apply a uniform analysis on all experimental data obtained from 2014 to
2016. This programme includes a signal pre-processing stage comprised of a 0.8 Hz high-pass
filtre followed by a band-pass filtre, with selectable bandwidth, based on the Fourier Transform
and Antitransform. The pre-processing ends with a signal normalisation stage. The entire preprocessing sequence does not significantly modify signal phases, since this information is
considered very important for subsequent analyses.
In this way each EEG file contributes equally to all the others, eliminating differences due to
variable amplitude and EEG signal artefacts of different participants. This new programme is
rather complex and contains many optional details (especially in pre-processing) that give
different numerical results to those documented in Giroldini et al. (2016) and Giroldini et al.
(2018). Nevertheless the global result of all processing agrees well with previous analyses (made
with other programmes) and essentially confirm already published results.
Analysis of the Sender’s EEG signals was done using simple averaging of time-and-phaselocked epochs and allowed easy identification of so-called ERPs (Event Related Potentials).
Furthermore, it was possible to easily identify ERPs also by calculating the signal power in a
conveniently filtred EEG band.
Nonetheless, when applied to Receivers, no known technique was able to identify a signal
equivalent to the ERP.
For this reason, in 2015 the author GW developed a new method for analysing ERPs, described
in Giroldini et al (2016b), which has been crucial in identifying a weak by significant response in
the Receiver coinciding with the stimulus given to the Sender. This method, here called Global
Synchrony, has been described in the abovementioned work, however its basic principles are
worth noting here.
This method is based on examining 4 seconds of data (1.5 s pre-stimulus, 1 s stimulus, 1.5 s post
stimulus) and then calculating the Pearson’s linear correlation between all channel pairs, using a
pair of fixed duration data segments during about 250 ms.
This segment pair (sliding window) is then slid along the time axis of the two signals (for all the
possible combinations), generating a series of curves R(I, X), where I represents pair
combinations, I = 91 in this case (14 electrodes x 13/2) and X is the time-samples. Subsequently
this series of curves is processed to produce a single graph Sync(x), that basically represents the
global variations of correlation (or synchronization) between all EEG channels, using suitable
pre- and post-stimulus periods as a baseline.
The resultant Sync1(x) curve shows a peak coinciding with the visual/auditory stimulus given to
a subject.
This method therefore helps to support the other ERP identification techniques, but Global
Synchrony has proven to be particularly useful because it allows identification of a significant
weak response also in the Receiver.

While in the Sender the response is very evident and does not require statistical analysis (see Fig
3), for the Receiver it was necessary to create a specific programme to calculate the response’s
significance level based on the GS routine (see Fig 4).
In order to compare these observed experimental values with a random estimate, for each
Receiver and for each stimulus condition, a new dataset of almost 50 Sync1(x) curves for every
trial was created based on a random position of the stimulus zone within the EEG recording and
in the same quantity of real stimulus number (32 or 100 or 128 stimuli), obtaining a so-called
“random dataset” of Sync2(x) curves.
It is thus possible to calculate an average curve of type Sync2(x), which represents the random
expectation from which are extracted statistical parameters necessary for evaluating the
significance level of results.

respectively at 10 Hz, 12 Hz and 14 Hz and calculated using the Global Synchrony and the Signal Power
methods. The response to the stimuli is easy to detect with any method in the Senders. The red curves in
the upper graphs represent the expected values due to chance.

Discussion of Results
This new overall independent analysis of the experiments done from 2014 to 2016, confirms
previously published results. Effectively it confirms that two subjects who are mentally and
emotionally connected can display a weak but significant transfer of information between them,
evidencing in the Receiver also neurophysiologically as a weak increase (of the order of 0.5%) of
cerebral Global Synchrony.
Although the directly stimulated subject (Sender) is obviously aware of the received stimulus,
the other member of the pair (Receiver) does not consciously perceive anything, yet his/her
central nervous system unconsciously recognizes a weak stimulus that produces a slight increase
of the Global Synchrony at the same time as the remote stimulus.
This effect has been proven by previous neurophysiological studies mentioned above, which
taken together suggest that the human mind can interact distantly with another mind without
using normal sensory channels (electromagnetic waves, sound waves, touch, smell, etc ).
Specifically, moreover, the results of this work show that the modulated frequency
visual/auditory stimulus, at a frequency between 10 to 18 Hz inclusive, given to the Sender can
be better identified in the Receiver using narrow-band filtration (1 Hz) of the EEG signal to

improve the signal/noise ratio, otherwise it is too difficult.
As already stated, if a standard analysis is performed on the Receivers based on simple averaging
of time-and-phase-locked epochs, no ERP is obtained. In fact, this technique requires ERPs to be
almost perfectly in phase in both time and waveform, otherwise there is a statistical cancellation
effect of the ERPs themselves.
From this observation we can reasonably deduce that, in response to the stimulus given to the
Sender, there is no stable waveform comparable to an ERP in the Receiver, nor a significant
variation in the EEG signal strength; we only know that in the Receiver there is a slight change
in cerebral coherence (or synchrony). Nonetheless we cannot exclude the possibility of this being
due to a waveform associated, but out of phase, with the stimuli, or other characteristics of EEG
activity undetected by the described method.
However, the Global Synchrony method seems particularly useful because (as described in
Giroldini et al 2016b) it works well even in the presence of substantial jitter (variations in signal
delay and its waveform). We can therefore conclude that this method represents a valid technique
for identifying a weak response in Receivers even in the presence of jitters and strong
background noise – a normal characteristic in EEGs.
For this reason, any future developments in the EEG analysis of this type of experiment should
consider a method based on inclusion of coherence and cerebral synchrony possibly coupled
with methods based on neural networks.
From that expounded here, moreover, it seems advantageous to give the Sender 90 – 100 stimuli
at random intervals to obtain statistically more significant values in GS without unduly tiring the
subject.
Cross-checking Steady-State frequencies
The results described here would assume a particular significance if they were selective with
respect to Steady-State stimulus frequency. In other words, we need to check if by filtring the
EEG signals in a frequency band that is different to that given to the Sender, we still get a
significant GS result.
This check was implemented particularly on the M15 and M18 series (comprised of 100 stimuli:
see Table 1) which were filtred at the frequencies of 18 Hz and 15 Hz respectively, obtaining two
Global Synchrony curves defined here as “cross-frequency”.
Similarly, the three Steady-State at 10, 12, and 14 Hz, comprised of 32 stimuli, were each filtred
at the other two frequencies, obtaining a total of 6 GS cross-frequency curves. The same type of
cross-frequency curves were then added together and compared to the sum of the GS curves
filtred at the exact stimulus frequency.

Table 4. comparison of two cumulative steady-state series with calculated cross-frequency series.

The graphs in Fig. 6 clearly show that if the EEG data are filtred in a different frequency band to
that of the stimulus, we obtain insignificant GS results with respect to chance expectation (red
curves in graphs), and still much less than those produced by filtration at the frequency stimulus.
The slight positive effect observed in the 6 series cross-frequency graph with 32 stimuli (top right)
falls within randomness, but can also be caused by a partial superposition effect of the stimulus
frequency bands. Indeed, the 10-12-14 Hz frequencies differ by 2 Hz, while the 15 and 18 Hz differ
by 3 Hz and, at a neural response level, the stimuli themselves assume a bandwidth > 1.5Hz, easily
observable by way of a Fourier analysis of the Sender’s EEG signals coinciding with the stimulus.
In general, we can say that the Receiver’s neural responses show an appreciable selectivity in
frequency.

A method for transmitting real information from mind to mind
In this article we used the terms Sender and Receiver to indicate two different roles, implying that
information is transmitted and received as in normal communication channels. However, whether or
not the correlations that emerged from the experiments described herein (as well as the cited
studies) are proof of actual information transmission between two sensorially isolated subjects has
yet to be determined beyond a doubt.
According to the current prevailing understanding of the mind and brain it is simply impossible for
two distant minds to connect, in that mental activity, and Consciousness in particular, depends only
on the “local” bioelectrical interactions of the approximately 100 billion cerebral neurones.
Nonetheless the most recent theories of Consciousness tend to take this type of distant mental
interaction into consideration, theorising the existence of a “quantum entanglement” between two
minds inspired by the well-known and proven entanglement between two sub-atomic particles,
which represents a fundamentally important phenomenon in modern Quantum Physics.
An example of a theory that proposes, as the source of Consciousness, the existence of
entanglement in neuronal microtubules is that put forward by Penrose and Hameroff (2014).
However it is not clear if this theory allows a distant mental connection.
Another recent theory, the Generalized Quantum Theory (Filk et al. 2011, Walach et al. 2016),
proposes the existence of a “quantum entanglement” between two minds, however at the same time
it denies that this is true “communication”, but rather a type of strange “acausal connection”
between two minds.
To quote Walach et al: “The relationship or correlation between two or among more than two
subsystems is acausal. Regarding this characteristic, their correlation cannot be used to transfer
information between or among the subsystems [Non Transmission axiom (Lucadou et al.
2007)].”
We believe that there can in fact exist a macroscopic form of “quantum entanglement” between
two minds, but we think it is possible to experimentally rebut the quoted Non-Transmission
axiom, as for any falsifiable scientific theory according to Karl Popper. In other words, we think
it is indeed possible to transmit real information between two isolated minds.
The method described herein has in fact the goal of proving whether or not it is actually possible
to transmit – in a purely mental way – real information from subject A to sensorially isolated
subject B.
In order to obtain the best experimental results, we believe it is necessary to strictly adhere to the
following conditions:
a) Determine three Steady-State stimulus frequencies (F1, F2, F3) at least 3 Hz apart, for
example 12, 15, & 18Hz, or 11, 14, & 17Hz. The information to be transmitted is the chosen
frequency in each trial, which (obviously) must only be known by the Senders.
b) Determine in advance the number of stimuli (at least 100), and the start and end times of each
stimulus in each trial. This advance information is useful for synchronizing times and precise

alignment of stimuli in the Receivers’ EEG recordings.
c) Total isolation of Sender and Receiver over long distances to eliminate any form of
conventional communication between them.
d) Select a certain number of Sender/Receiver pairs (at least 10 or 15) who have performed well
individually in simple tests such as those described in this article.
e) Organize an experiment in which multiple Senders (10 – 15) simultaneously receive the same
visual/auditory stimulus at the F1 steady-state frequency (we have reason to believe that
multiple synchronized Senders are more efficient that one).
f) Make EEG recordings of different Receivers (10 – 15) simultaneously with high accuracy in
relation to the stimulus timing, using the pre-determined time information.
g) Subsequently, carry out a GS analysis on all subjects, filtring the signals in the three bands
(about 1 Hz wide) centred on the F1, F2, F3 frequencies.
h) Calculate the GS for each frequency and identify the maximum correlation value (as the
average of all the 10 or 15 Receivers): this value corresponds to one of the three frequencies.
Consider therefore this frequency as the transmitted information – the method is simply like a
“majority vote”. It is of course possible to also calculate the significance of this result.
i) By repeating this experimental procedure many times it is possible to transmit, in each group
of attempts, a single frequency. The sequence of frequencies can constitute a coded message,
because it is possible to easily prove how well the “received” frequencies match the
transmitted ones by calculating their relative probabilities.
Finally, it would be advantageous to put together a research group which includes the
participation of M. Persinger to confirm the theory that it is possible to increase mental
connection (Rouleau et al 2015) by simultaneously applying a particular magnetic field to both
Sender and Receiver before the tests.

Conclusions
We believe that the combination of all the studies on a distant connection between two minds is
indicative of properties of the mind far from the classical reductionist view, but a more detailed
theoretical discussion will be covered in a later article.
Undoubtedly, to allow a proper temporal synchronization, the method described herein requires
foreknowledge of certain information and it is also inefficient in terms of speed of transmission
of information (bit/s). However, it allows us to know if it really is possible to transmit
information from mind to mind according to a classical “causal” method, in which a known
stimulus generates a statistically significant and easily identifiable EEG response in the Receiver,
rather than theorizing about a strange acausal relationship between two minds.

What we have here, in the authors’ opinion, is a contribution of great importance towards
understanding the true nature of Consciousness and the mind.
