Abstract—We combined the new developments of multimodal Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) and wireless EEG
headsets with art by creating BrainBrush. Users can paint
on a virtual canvas by moving their heads, blinking their eyes
and performing selections using a P300 BCI. A qualitative
evaluation (n=13) was done. A questionnaire was administered
and structured interviews were conducted to assess the usability
and user experience of the system. Most participants were able
to achieve good control over the modalities and able to express
themselves creatively. The user experience of the modalities
varied. The use of head movement was considered most positive
with the use of eye blinks coming in second. Users were less
positive about the use of the BCI because of the low reliability
and higher relative cost of an error. Even though the reliability
of the BCI was low, the BCI was considered to have an added
value: the use of BCI was considered to be fun and interesting.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The act of creative expression is considered by many to
be a purely human ability and skill [1]. Creative expression
allows humans to express their identity and it can take multiple forms: for instance making music, dancing, painting,
writing or acting. Apart from these more traditional forms
of art, new art forms have emerged, such as computer art,
motion graphics and the use of virtual reality environments
for art.
In recent years, a neurorevolution has taken place in which
neurotechnology is a hot topic. For instance, research has
been done on improving task performance using neurotechnology. Some athletes now use neurofeedback training to
enhance their performance by managing the stress of training
and competition [2]. Furthermore, Ros et al. have shown
that the microsurgical skills of ophthalmic microsurgeons
can be improved significantly with neurofeedback training
[3]. Neurotechnology has even been applied to the field of
economics, creating the science of neuroeconomics: combining neuroscience, economics and psychology to explain
the human decision making process [4]. In neuromarketing,
neurotechnology is used to research why consumers make
certain choices: for instance, why consumers prefer either
Pepsi or Coca Cola [5]
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are another example of

research in the field of neuroscience are. A BCI provides
a direct interface between a human brain and a computer,
without using peripheral nerves or muscles. For years BCI
research has mainly focused on assistive technology for
people with disabilities. For instance, patients with the motor
neuron disease Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) can now
benefit from BCIs like the P300 speller [6], brain-controlled
wheelchairs [7] or BCIs to control their environment [8].
In recent years, BCI research has also focused on applications for healthy people. One example is the ‘NeuroPhone’
system developed by Campbell et al. which allows neural
signals to drive mobile phone applications on an iPhone
using a wireless EEG headset, for instance to dial a phone
number using the same principles as the P300 speller [9].
Furthermore, research is being done on incorporating
BCI technology in games. Plass-Oude Bos et al. developed AlphaWoW, incorporating BCI in the game ‘World
of Warcraft R ’ [10]. They used alpha waves in the EEG for
automatic adaptation of the avatar shape from bear to elf and
vice versa. Gürkök et al. used SSVEP for sheep herding in
the game ‘Mind the Sheep!’ [11].
BCIs can also provide a unique link between the
source of creativity, the brain, and art. Christoph De
Boeck created a responsive environment, Staalhemel
(http://www.staalhemel.com), where 80 steel segments are
suspended in a room, above the visitor’s head. The visitors
wear a portable EEG headset and as they walk through
the room, tiny hammers are activated by their brainwaves,
tapping rhythmical patterns on the steel segments.
Other examples of the use of Brain-Computer
Interfaces for art include the ‘Brain-ComputerMusic Interface’ which enables a disabled person
to create music [12], and the ‘Câmara Neuronal’, a
performance where the brain signals of the performer
are translated into audio and visual compositions
(http://projects.jmartinho.net/3486412/Camara-NeuronalVideo-Teaser).
The German artist Adi Hösle, in cooperation with the
Institute of Medical Psychology and Behavioural Neurobiology at the University of Tübingen, designed the application
‘Brain Painting’, a painting application which is controlled
using a BCI and enables paralyzed patients to express
themselves creatively. In ‘Brain Painting’, all actions are

performed using the P300 paradigm. The system uses two
screens for the painter: one screen displays the P300 matrix
while another, larger, screen shows the painting canvas.
The standard P300 speller matrix, containing characters and
numbers, was adapted to contain symbols indicating different colors, objects, grid sizes, object sizes, transparency,
zoom and cursor movement. By repeatedly making selections using this P300 speller matrix, users can paint pictures
on the virtual canvas. In the first evaluation of the ‘Brain
Painting’ application, with 3 ALS-patients and 10 healthy
subjects, both the ALS-patients and the healthy subjects
were able to use the application with high accuracies: during
a copy-painting task, the ALS patients achieved an average
copy-painting accuracy of 70.18% while the healthy subjects
scored an average accuracy of 80.53% [13]. One participant
in the ‘Brain Painting’ study, who was severely disabled
due to ALS, described her experience with the system: “I
am deeply moved to tears. I have not been able to paint
for more than 5 years. Today I again had butterflies in my
stomach, a feeling that I have missed for so much, so much
[sic]. I was so sad, I was plagued by fears of loss, I was in
shock because I could not paint. For me the picture I have
created is so typical for me, no other paints in my style,
and despite five years of absence, I am simply an artist
again; I’m back to life!”. Even though this feedback is very
positive, the artistic freedom of the painter is limited due to
the fact the cursor cannot be moved freely; the cursor can
only be moved in a predetermined grid.
In continuation of the ‘Brain Painting’ research, Holz et al.
developed the ‘Brain Drawing’ application to overcome the
cursor movement limitation of the ‘Brain Painting’ system.
In the ‘Brain Drawing’ application, imagined movement is
used to control the cursor when drawing. During the first
evaluation with 1 subject, the subject performed a Copy
Drawing task in which he was instructed to draw a simple
object (circle, ellipse or rectangle) on a virtual canvas. Holz
et al. considered 4 out of 36 copied drawings to be succesful
by visual inspection and the subject found it very difficult
to draw. The subject had to focus his attention for a long
period because he continuously had to imagine movement,
which resulted in high workload [14].
Todd et al. used two different BCIs in their research on
how creativity can be supported and assessed using a BCI
[15]. With their first BCI, users could only control a drawing
cursor in horizontal and vertical directions by looking at
one of four LEDs placed at the top, bottom, left and right
of the screen. The cursor would move in the direction of
the LED the user looked at, and continue drawing in that
direction until the user looked at another LED. For the
second application, the four LEDs were mapped onto four
shapes (circle, star, square and line). After choosing a shape,
the shape would be drawn on the canvas. Users did not
have any control over the position, size or color of the
shapes. Todd et al. concluded that relying completely on the

efficiency of a BCI for image production is not practical
as BCI technology is not yet mature enough for 100%
reliability. A possible solution they suggest is to create a
hybrid, or multimodal, BCI by combining a BCI with other
input modalities such as an eye-tracker.
These examples show that the focus in BCI research
should shift from reliability to usability and user experience
as is also reported by the FutureBNCI roadmap [1]. This
shift in focus is necessary in order for BCIs to migrate out
of the lab and into society. Healthy persons can choose from
various alternative input modalities. For healthy persons to
choose for BCI, the user experience and usability must
be adequate. Most people have never used a BCI and the
novelty of this new technology can be a reason for people
to decide to use a BCI instead of alternative input modalities,
even if a BCI is less reliable and slower. However, if the user
experience and usability are not good, people are expected
to choose a different input modality which provides a better
user experience and usability. Due to the fact that the focus
in BCI research has mainly been on the reliability, no
standardized methods to assess the user experience for BCIs
exist yet. Gürkök et al., Plass-Oude Bos et al. and Van de
Laar et al. addressed the need for standardized methods to
assess the user experience for BCIs [16], [17], [18]. Van
de Laar et al. proposed a questionnaire consisting of a core
containing general questions and modules for the different
kinds of mental tasks and ways of interacting with the BCI
[19].
In this study, we combined the new developments of
multimodal BCIs and wireless EEG headsets with art by
creating a multimodal interactive system (called BrainBrush)
which allows healthy persons, but possibly also patients, to
express themselves creatively. We evaluated this system to
explore how the different modalities contribute to the user
experience and whether BCI has an added value for this
system.
II. M ETHODS
First we will describe how BrainBrush was developed and
how the design choices were made. Second we will outline
how we set up our experiment to evaluate the system.
A. Development of BrainBrush
BrainBrush (see figure 1) was developed in a two step
iterative process. The outcome of the first evaluation and
how this influenced our design choices is however beyond
the scope of this paper. For a more in-depth description see
the work by Brugman [20].
We aimed to design the BrainBrush system in such a way
that it would be appealing to healthy persons and would also
be usable for patients who had lost control from their neck
down (e.g. due to spinal cord injury). We expected healthy
persons would find it appealing to be able to operate the
BrainBrush system using only head movement, eyeblinks

and brain activity because it is completely different to how
healthy people normally use a computer. For patients who do
not have control over their limbs, it is a necessity to be able
to operate the system using nothing else than the described
modalities.
Head movement, the P300 speller and eyeblinks were
used as the input modalities for the BrainBrush system.
Head movement has been used successfully in the past as
an input modality, for instance to control a cursor [21].
Furthermore, the P300 speller has proven to be a robust BCI
paradigm [22] and has been used in many BCI systems.
The P300 signal is a positive deflection in the ongoing
EEG signal observed roughly 300ms post stimulus over the
centro-parietal area of the skull [6]. Finally, eyeblinks have
been used for communication systems for ALS patients, such
as the system for making selections on a computer screen
proposed by Takeshita et al. [23]. However, the eyeblinks
are usually detected using a camera and image processing
techniques, instead of using an EEG headset. Chambayil et
al. have shown promising results for their virtual keyboard
BCI which uses eyeblinks to select characters [24]. All three
modalities can be captured by one device: the Emotiv EPOC,
using the EEG sensors and built-in gyro sensors.
The task of creating a brushstroke requires the system
to provide users with a way to signal when they want the
paintbrush to be put to the canvas and to signal once again
when they want to take the paintbrush off the canvas, thereby
ending the brushstroke. This on/off switch for the paintbrush
has been implemented by detecting intentional eyeblinks in
the EEG data based on an algorithm by Plass-Oude Bos et al.
[25]. A template was constructed out of an EEG recording
with 40 intentional eye blinks. A threshold is set for the
Euclidean distance between the template and the live EEG
data over channels AF3 and AF4. Both template and window
have a length of 103 samples. When the Euclidean distance
is below the threshold on either of the channels the on/off
switch is triggered.

Head movement was implemented by using the gyro
sensors of the Emotiv EPOC headset. An application called
the Mouse Emulator is provided with the device and was
used to convert head movement into cursor movement in
order to move the paintbrush across the virtual canvas.
In BrainBrush, we use P300 speller grids for the selection
of brushes and colors because the P300 speller is suitable
for making selections from a large set of options in a
relatively short period of time [26], compared to other
Brain-Computer Interfacing paradigms. In a study performed
by Guger et al. with healthy participants, 88.9% of the
participants were able to achieve at least 80% accuracy using
the P300 speller paradigm [22], showing the robustness of
the P300 signal. Although, we suspect a lower accuracy in
our system because of the lower signal quality of the EPOC
hardware. For BrainBrush, we use the original grid structure,
but instead of grids with characters, grids with pictures are
used where each picture depicts a certain brush or color
(see Figures 2 and 3). The P3Speller module of the BCI2000
framework is used for the implementation of the P300 speller
grids [27]. The stimulus duration is set to 100ms and the
inter-stimulus interval to 175ms. For the selection of a brush
or color, 15 sequences of flashes are shown, meaning each
row and column flashes 15 times. Therefore, the target is
flashed 30 times in total.
Finally, BrainBrush uses the open source MyPaint application to provide us with a virtual canvas (see figure 1). An
overview of the complete system can be seen in figure 4.

B. Experimental Design
The BrainBrush system was evaluated on user experience
with a qualitative user study. We want to gain an understanding of underlying reasons and motivations for both the
positive and negative opinions the participants formed about
the user experience with the system and the various input
modalities. Participants were asked to fill out an informed
consent form and provide their demographic details. They

were given instructions on how to use the P3 Speller. They
could try the P300 speller in a practice session, after any
questions the experimenter proceeded to record a training
session for the P300 classifier [28]. Training data consisted
of a 10 letter word (‘BRAINPOWER’) with 15 sequences
utilizing all 14 channels of the Emotiv EPOC. After the
training session an online session was carried out in which
participants tried to spell the 5 letter word ‘PAINT’ using
the P3Speller without feedback so not to bias their expectations. Next, participants were given instructions on using
BrainBrush. After 5 minutes of familiarizing themselves the
free painting sessions started and the experimenter left the
room. Participants could take as long as they wanted, up to
30 minutes. If they wanted to stop painting at an earlier point
in time, they would ring a bell to signal the experimenter.
After the free painting session, the experimenter would
administer the SUS questionnaire [29] followed by an indepth structured interview.

and designs daily for study-related purposes; participant 012
paints once a week as a form of recreation; participant
008 regularly uses Photoshop and participant 009 sometimes
plays the drawing-game ‘Draw Someting’ on the iPad.
During the interviews after the free painting session, the
participants were asked what accuracy they thought they
had been able to achieve with the brush and color selection
during the free painting session. These results together with
the results from the online session are shown in table I.
During the experiments of participants 006 and 011, the
classifier was accidentally not loaded during the online
spelling session. Therefore, no copy spelling results are
available for these participants. For the other 11 participants,
the average accuracy during copy spelling was 56.4% (standard deviation: 23.4%, minimum 20%, maximum 80%).
The average SUS score for all participants was 66.2
(standard deviation: 14.2, minimum: 45, maximum: 87.5).
A score of 68 would be average for all systems tested with
SUS. During the interviews participants were asked to order
the three modalities on pleasantness. An overview of the
results can be seen in figure 5.
A summary of all analyzed topics covered in the questionnaire can be seen in table II.

the P300 speller to select different brushes and colors.
The presented system is the first of its kind utilizing these
modalities.
A user study with thirteen participants showed that the
BrainBrush system does not enable all users to express
themselves creatively. The group of users who were able
to achieve good control over all three input modalities
were able to expres themselves creatively and made nice
paintings. However, for all users to be able to achieve this,
the reliability of the input modalities must be improved.
The head movement modality was considered to be the
most pleasant. However, misalignment of the cursor and
a lack of smoothness negatively influenced the user experience. Replacing the Emotiv Mouse Emulator program
with new software to translate head movement to cursor
movement, is expected to improve the user experience.
After the head movement modality, the use of eyeblinks
to turn the brush on or off was considered to be the
most pleasant. In general, the user experience for this input
modality was positive. However, the user experience can
be further enhanced by performing more research into the
topic of intentional eyeblink detection and improving the
detection.
The P300 speller was considered to be the least pleasant

input modality. In contrast to the other two input modalities,
the user experience was not positive: using the P300 speller
was considered to be mentally tiring and it caused physical
discomfort and frustration. Participants suggested improvements to the P300 training setup and to the BrainBrush
system.
The multimodal aspect of the system was good for the
user experience. The combination of the three input modalities within the BrainBrush system was considered to be
positive: it was a combination that made sense to most users
and the input modalities were well balanced.
Finally, concerning the value of BCI for a multimodal
interactive system for creative expression, we can conclude
that BCI does have an added value: even though there were
some issues due to the BCI modality, the use of BCI was
considered to be fun, cool and interesting.
We feel the BrainBrush system in its current state offers a
good basis, and with the suggested improvements, the user
experience should improve further.
