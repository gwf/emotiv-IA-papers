ABSTRACT
Environmental and personal characteristics influence the behavior of individuals through the
limitation of effort levels by a more or less rapid induction of fatigue. In particular, mental
fatigue is recognized as a major cause of errors leading to accidents. As a consequence,
thermal environment study has gained increasing importance in recent years. In order
to contribute to enlarge the knowledge in this field, this work aims to present an essay
protocol to evaluate the influence of the thermal environment on mental fatigue, based on
electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis. With this purpose an exploratory study was held
with 36 volunteers to validate the protocol. Volunteers simulated an administrative task for
one hour. Fatigue assessment was carried out by analyzing Alpha and Beta waves amplitude
over time. Assays were performed in a climatic chamber with controlled temperature and
humidity: 22°C (40 and 80% RH) and 32°C (40 and 80% RH). Results suggest that both
temperature and humidity influence the amplitude of the EEG signal (Alpha and Beta
waves) in both hemispheres. The greatest amplitudes were found whenever environmental
temperature and/or relative humidity values were higher. At the end of the article the
advantages and limitations of mental fatigue assessment are discussed.
Keywords: EEG; Mental Fatigue; Thermal Environnement; Fatigue Indexes.

1. INTRODUCTION
Cultural intelligence and multicultural personality emerge as new constructs that enhance
adaptation and effective adjustment to environments characterized by cultural diversity,
namely within enterprises context (Sousa et al. 2015). According to Pinto (2013) for a
better economic development, it is fundamental to have a very close cooperation between
companies and universities. Information and knowledge have taken a central role in the
economy (Sequeira et al., 2011).
In studies about the influence of the thermal environment, one of the factors that needs
to be controlled is the acclimation state. Acclimation plays a key role in human health risks
prevention. It occurs in Human body, as a physiologic adjustment process to a continuous
exposure to a thermal environment different from the usual. This physiological response has
transient characteristics during the adaptation time of the body between the initial state
and the one to which it is intended to acclimate. Several authors as Olesen & Fanger (1973)

and Parsons (2003) investigated acclimation and its consequences and one of the easiest
parameters to measure is the skin temperature.
Dry heat acclimation is different from humid heat acclimation, because the physiological
adaptation is different between these two conditions. Although the literature about this
matter is rather scarce, there is evidence to support this expectation (Sawka, 2001).
Acclimatization to heat, in dry or hot conditions, is likely to confer an important advantage
by causing a decrease in core body temperature between 0.3 and 0.5 °C (Buono et al., 1989).
Radakovic (2007) also studied the effects of acclimation on cognitive and physiological
performance under heat stress in soldiers, when carrying out stress tests.
The development of mental fatigue is a complex process. It is determined by an interaction
between psychological and physiological factors. Mental fatigue may manifest itself through
the reduction of alertness levels as a consequence of reduced cognitive performance, leading
to a decrease in safety levels. The nature of mental fatigue can be subjective, objective and
physiological. Subjective fatigue corresponds to the feeling of tiredness, objective fatigue is
usually related to a decrease in performance and physiological fatigue can be defined as a
reduction in the neuromuscular capacity of the system to carry out its functions as a result
of physiological overload and strain (Haworth et al., 1988).
Fatigue contributes to a significant number of accidents. In driving, the values of 2030% are indicated (Punsawad et al., 2011). For this reason, in recent years, there has been a
growing interest in studying mental fatigue, being electroencephalography (EEG) technology
widely used. EEG is indicated as the most reliable and predictive indicator of mental fatigue
even when it has physiological origin (Shen et al., 2007).
Mental fatigue is related to the effects that people may experience during or after
prolonged periods of cognitive activity (Zang et al., 2010). Therefore, sleepiness and a lack
of concentration may arise in people performing long and/or stressing period tasks (Fallahi et
al., 2016; Jolly et al., 2016). EEG is also used to study problems as different as visual fatigue
(Zou et al., 2015), dissociation between mental fatigue and low motivational state (Gergelyfi
et al., 2015) or even the effects of computer games on changes in cognitive functions (Aliyari
et al., 2015).
There have been several indexes associated with the EEG, presented as possibly being
correlated to mental fatigue. Among them are the four EEG wave types (delta, 0-4 Hz,
theta, 4-7 Hz, alpha, 8-13 Hz and beta, 13-20 Hz) (Shen et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2007).
The relationship between the power of α / β waves is also used as an early warning indicator
(Nybo et al., 2001; Ftaiti et al., 2010). Cheng (2007) classified the EEG indices into two
groups: the basic indices (delta, theta, alpha and beta features) already mentioned and the
ratios derived from these basic indices (Cheng et al., 2007).
To measure fatigue, usually, are used 17 electrodes placed on specific points of the scalp
labelled as: front (F), central (C), parietal (P), occipital (O), the temporal lobe (T): FP1; FP2;
F7; F8; F3; F4; T3; T4; C3; C4; T5; T6; P3; P4; O1; O2 e Fz; Cz; Pz (Shem et al., 2007).
Among these key points, it was found that the electrodes placed in the frontal and occipital
regions of the scalp are the most important for the classification of mental fatigue at various
levels. These findings are consistent with knowledge about the functions of the anatomical
regions that manage mental fatigue. Based on this previous knowledge, this study aims to
present an essay protocol to evaluate the influence of the thermal environment on mental
activity.

2. MATERIALS AND METHOD
2.1. Stages of Protocol Development – Global Overview
The development of the protocol went through two stages:
1. The first stage, involving: literature review, test of the necessary equipment to perform
the experimental trials, submission of the project to CEUP (Ethics Committee of the
University of Porto) and selection of the sample according to the defined strategy.
2. The second stage, definition of the study design, involved two steps:
• the first step: a pilot test to analyze the repeatability of the study, testing five
volunteers in different conditions of temperature and relative humidity (RH)
(22ºC-40%RH; 22ºC-80%RH; 32ºC-40%RH; 32ºC-80%RH).
• the second step: design of the final protocol, was made with all the experience,
decisions and corrections from the essays carried out in the pilot tests.
2.2. Materials
The materials used to test and implement the protocol are identified in the Table 1.

2.2.1. The importance of maintaining the climatic conditions
It is already commonly assumed that temperature and humidity conditions have a
significant influence in terms of performance and fatigue development. In this context,
the ability to control and manipulate these conditions in order to evaluate their effects is
fundamental when assessing the extent to which these parameters influence the development
of fatigue (Cheung, 2010).
2.2.2 Measurement of brain activity
Mental fatigue is a gradual and cumulative process also associated with reduced
efficiency, reduced alertness and decreased capacity for mental performance (Grandjean,
1979; Cutsem et al., 2017). These changes, reflecting the brain reaction to external stimuli,
can be recorded through EEG (Lal & Craig 2001; Berka et al., 2007). The brain’s electrical
activity is classified according to frequency bandwidths as mentioned (delta, theta, alpha
and beta). The delta activity appears in the transition between drowsing,ess and sleep. Theta
rhythm are associated with several psychological states including low levels of alertness and
31

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Vol. VI, Issue 1, (2018) 29-39

consequently are associated with a decrease in information processing. Alpha waves occur
during daytime, particularly on the occipital cortex and can be clearly observed when the
eyes are closed. When the eyes are open its wave amplitude range decreases. These rhythms
are present both in alertness as on relaxation. The beta waves are associated with increasing
arousal /alertness. These waves are still associated with the reaction time of motor tasks (Lal
& Craig 2001; Borghini et al., 2017).
For this protocol an Emotive SDK EEG device was used (Figure 1a). The electrodes must
be installed in the standard positions: parietal and frontal temporal, as shown in Figure 1b.
The head set / electrode has to be adjusted so that two reference electrodes are positioned in
the mastoid area. The electrodes should be adjusted carefully to ensure a good contact. In
Figure 1c each circle represents a sensor and its color the contact quality. When all sensors
are marked in green, it means that the best overall contact quality has been achieved.

2.2.3. Skin temperature
When the skin temperature exceeds the ambient temperature, heat can be dissipated
through thermal changes by radiation, convection, conduction and evaporation. When the
ambient temperature is above the skin temperature, evaporation is the only mechanism
by which the body can lose heat. Sweat evaporation depend on the water vapor pressure
gradient on the surface of the skin, which, in turn, depends on ambient temperature and
relative humidity of the air. (Maughan et al., 2007).
The overall relative power of the different EEG frequency bandwidths, and skin
temperature (local and medium), and are sensitive and respond to the ambient temperature
and the thermal sensations of the volunteers (Yao et al., 2008). It is also important to
note that both skin temperature and thermal sensation appear to reach a constant level
approximately 20 minutes after exposure onset (Nagano et al., 2005).
The experimental initial procedure consisted in recording the demographic and
anthropometric data of each volunteer as well as the skin temperature in 14 points of the
body according to ISO 9886: 2004, in order to evaluate its evolution over time. Before
starting the test, the volunteer had two consecutive stabilization periods. The first 20
minutes period for a first stabilization took place in the laboratory space at a controlled
temperature of 20 ± 1 ° C . The second 10 minutes additional period took place within the
climatic chamber, for adaptation to temperature and humidity test conditions.
After analyzing the results of the temperature evolution in the fourteen points of the
body defined by the referred standard, it was found that not all of them had the same levels
of stability over time. Thus, since it is only intended to have an indicator that a balance
between body temperature and ambient temperature has been reached, it has been decided,
for reasons of comfort for volunteers, to reduce these measurements to the forehead and
back of the neck (figure 2).

2.3 Sedentary task
For the simulation of sedentary work, the GoNoGo Classic test is used for 60 consecutive
minutes, with computer support. (Costa et al., 2013d). This task requires the subject to click
on a computer key when a stimulus appears (in this case the letter P) and not reacting when
another stimulus occurs (in this case, the letter R) and this simple decision is repeated by
volunteers for as long as it is determined.

3. PROTOCOL DESCRIPTION
One of the main concerns in the design of this protocol is to minimize the possibility of
bias, considering bias any deviation that prevents a result to be considered incontestable
(Gerhard, 2008). In the next few pages the essay protocol will be presented systematically
with a sequential summarized description of the different steps to be followed and its
justification, whenever it is considered justified.
Stages prior to the tests:
1. Project design for approval in ethics committee.
The Helsinki Declaration, in its 7th Revision in 2008, Articles 20, 21 and 22, declares
the right of individuals to self-determination and to make informed decisions about
participation in research, both at the beginning and in the course of the research.
2. Elaboration of the informed consent document to be read and signed by each of the
subjects submitted to the test, According to Annex A of ISO Standard 12894: 2001.
33

3. Selection of the sample according to the following criteria, in order to minimize bias:
a) Gender - the sample should be all of the same gender or have a significant number
of subjects of each gender;
b) Defined age group(s);
c) Have an equivalent professional activity;
d) Not be a smoker;
e) Band(s) of defined body mass index(es);
f) Have a stable weight in the last six months;
g) Be a habitual consumer of breakfast;
h) Be unmedicated;
i) Have a good general health;
j) Do not have a disease register in the last 12 months.
The sample itself is one of the most common bias factors. The selection bias, a statistical
base error caused by a bias in sampling, can occur when a group with certain influent
characteristics is selected more frequently than other groups in the sample. This may produce
imprecise conclusions if the selection bias is not identified. For example: if a global response
is to be achieved and one gender predominates over the other; if the age distribution or
professional activity of the sample does not match the population to be studied.
Other types of bias may arise from mixing in the same sample individuals with different
behaviors, such as smoking habits and sleep / wake cycles, as well as substance use with a
direct effect on behavior or wakefulness, such as alcohol, tea, coffee, some types of medicines,
psychotropic substances or others. In the case of tests that can be performed under different
temperature and humidity conditions, a sample with individuals with different values of
Body Mass Index (BMI) may also be a bias factor due to the different physiological response
to different temperatures, in particular at more extreme temperatures.
4. Operation test of each equipment and of all the steps of the protocol, for training the
procedures and verification of any failures;
These tests are important not only to dismiss problems as simple as the state of the
battery charge, the operation of the support software or the adhesion of the adhesives
to attach the sensors to the skin, as well as to avoid any hesitation with the volunteers
during the tests.
5. Detailed explanation to each volunteer of all test procedures;
a) Explain the functioning of the Climate Chamber;
b) Detailed explanation of the test, as well as its purpose;
c) Explain what a skin temperature sensor is;
d) Explain what an EEG is;
e) Explain that they will respond to a thermal sensation questionnaire with three
questions (Table 2):
• Question 1 - determines the sensation vote on the ASHRAE scale, which
can be directly comparable to the PMV Thermal Comfort Index measure,
as described in ISO7730: 2005.
• Question 2 - reflects the feeling how the volunteer would like to feel at the
moment.
• Question 3 - reflects the “state of health” at the end of the test.
f) Explain the volunteer’s necessary prior preparation:
• Type of clothing to wear: shorts, t-shirt, slippers;
• Report that there is a robe available for warm clothing before and after
completing the tests;
• Hygiene care of the body and head;
34

Costa, E. Q., Baptista, J. S., Carvalho, J. (2018). JSOD, VI(1), 29-39
1. Importance of bringing the scalp clean and without any trace of
softener, gel or foam;
2. Importance of bringing clean skin so that the sensors can adhere as
better as possible;
• Caring on feeding during test days as well as days prior to testing (avoiding
changes in diet, in the consumption of alcohol, coffee and tea);
• Rest conveniently on test days;
• Report if any medicine was taken prior to test.
g) Present the emergency contact list;
h) Explain the procedures in case of emergency;
i) Record the volunteer’s data in the database and schedule the trials by mutual
agreement;
Explanation of each trial detail to each volunteer is not only a way of passing information,
but also of creating bonds of trust with the researcher. The knowledge of the different stages
of the test and what is supposed to feel in each of them, helps to control the stress levels of
a trial that besides being relatively long, needs to be repeated several times under different
environmental conditions. From the experience in the application of this protocol, the first
trials should be conducted on thermal comfort conditions. This can help to prevent frictional
discomfort among volunteers with the consequent reduction of the sample number during
the tests.
The volunteers are tested one by one in each of the previously defined conditions. All
tests must be performed in the morning and at the same time, before the subject performs
any other activity, in order to avoid variations in the initial conditions of the tests.
Main protocol:
6. Volunteer reception in the laboratory;
7. Informed consent statement read and signed by the volunteer;
8. Completion of the initial questionnaire (to verify if there are conditions to start the
test);
If the volunteer has not had a good night’s sleep or any other bias factor has been
identified the test should not be performed;
9. Completion of the thermal sensation questionnaire (Table 2);
10. Wear the test clothes (shorts, shirts and slippers);
The use of clothing with the same level of protection is an important factor in that it
allows all volunteers to perform the tests under the same conditions avoiding biases
at this level.
11. Placement of the sensors for measuring skin temperature at two points: Forehead and
neck;
12. Stabilization of the skin temperature for at least 20 minutes before entering the
climatic chamber, with real-time temperature verification from the sensors placed;
During this period, the volunteer should remain seated to minimize metabolic
oscillations;
13. Enter in the climatic chamber.
The entrance must be fast to minimize temperature fluctuations inside the chamber;
14. Sit the volunteers comfortably in front of the computer;
15. Stabilization of the skin temperature for at least 10 minutes, with real-time verification
of the values. During these 10 minutes:
a) The volunteer should respond to the thermal sensation questionnaire (Annex 1),

35

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Vol. VI, Issue 1, (2018) 29-39

b) The researcher should place the EEG equipment on the volunteer, making sure
that all the sensors are emitting properly the signal,
c) After placing the equipment, remember the volunteer to remain as quiet as possible,
avoiding to move the head (head movement can cause noise in the signal);
16. Start the test which should take 60 minutes, using a single battery of cognitive tests
(GoNoGo type) throughout the test;
It is expected that during this test some volunteers will experience periods of
drowsiness or even sleep. All these periods should be recorded in order to later help in
the interpretation of the values obtained from the EEG.
17. At the end of the trial, the volunteer must complete the thermal sensation questionnaire
again;
18. Disconnect and remove EEG equipment from the volunteer’s head;
19. Exit the camera;
20. After leaving, the volunteer should wait at least 10 minutes outside the chamber to
stabilize the body temperature, wrapping himself in a robe;
21. Remove the temperature sensors;
22. Collect and make copies of all data generated during the test.

4. ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS OF MENTAL FATIGUE TESTS
This work presents a protocol for conducting tests that allow the identification of the effects
of temperature and humidity variations on mental fatigue. The research carried out so far has
identified the fundamental parameters to be monitored, as well as the necessary equipment
to perform the monitoring in real time and continuously. The individuals submitted to the
tests will know the respective physiological response in different environmental conditions,
which may help them or others in future professional and other options. For the general
population, greater knowledge in the area creates conditions for better choices in terms of
living and working conditions. Knowledge in this area can also contribute to a safer working
environment, particularly in tasks where possible cognitive errors can lead to accidents.
The main constraints are, firstly, the need for material and human resources with a
relatively high level of technology, in particular for the analysis of results, which requires
specific technical and scientific expertise, in particular EEG data analysis, processing and
interpretation. Secondly, it requires participants to perform several tests of relatively long
duration, about two hours per test.
