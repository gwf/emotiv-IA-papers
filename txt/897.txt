ing decisions and thinking about them, i.e., without
any sort of intervention of physical movement. In
other words, a BCI system is an interface between
the brain and computer to translate, process, and
classify the electroencephalograph (EEG) signals [1].
After classi cation, this system sends commands to
external devices, such as a wheelchair, to control it
(Figure 1). A motor imagery system controls arti cial
devices by solely thinking about them. Movements
of an arti cial hand by thinking about its movement
is one of the various examples of the applications of
such systems, which is a predominant strategy for
motor rehabilitation in stroke patients. Note that BCI
systems are meant to be wearable, yet not sensible,
in future applications; hence, it will be convenient
and transparent to others. Moreover, BCI technology
as a classi cation system is well established and has

There is a tremendous interest in implementing BCIs on portable platforms, such as Field
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) due to their low-cost, low-power and portability
characteristics. This article presents the design and implementation of a Brain Computer
Interface (BCI) system based on motor imagery on a Virtex-6 FPGA. In order to design an
accurate algorithm, the proposed method avails statistical learning methods such as Mutual
Information (MI), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Support Vector Machine
(SVM). It also uses Separable Common Spatio Spectral Pattern (SCSSP) method in order
to extract features. Simulation results prove achieved performances of 73.54% for BCI
competition III-dataset V, 67.2% for BCI competition IV-dataset 2a with all four classes,
80.55% for BCI competition IV-dataset 2a with the rst two classes, and 81.9% for captured
signals. Moreover, the nal reported hardware resources determine its eciency as a result
of using retiming and folding techniques from the VLSI architecture' perspective. The
complete proposed BCI system achieves not only excellent recognition accuracy, but also
remarkable implementation eciency in terms of portability, power, time, and cost.

disabilities.

various applications, for instance, for patients with
paraplegic devices. Therefore, any e ort to improve its
performance and/or ecient implementation is needed
and valuable.
Although there exist several other controlling
approaches, especially for patient or elderly care, motor
imagery BCI system has some advantages over them.
For instance, eye tracking [2] is not applicable in case
the patients have visual or eye muscle problems, such
as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Locked-In
Syndrome (LIS), and, therefore, cannot control their
eye muscles to move their eye in a certain direction [35]. Other problems of eye tracking can be found in
dim light conditions or where the patient needs to
notice his/her surrounding which would be dangerous
for them to move their eye in other directions (e.g.,
when a patient in a wheelchair is passing on the street).
Moreover, people with glasses can use BCI system
much more conveniently than those with eye tracker
can. Apart from their di erences, both eye tracking
and motor imagery BCI require a wearable device; eye
tracker requires a pair of glasses to hold a camera
to track eye, and BCI system requires a hat with
electrodes. Moreover, note that despite the advantages
of BCI system over eye tracking, eye tracker has the
advantage of higher accuracy in comparison to motor
imagery BCI.
In particular, in motor imagery BCI system, when
a subject imagines moving, a typical desynchronization
of upper alpha and beta rhythms is observed in the sensorimotor cortex [6], followed by a re-synchronization.
This pattern of activation can be easily detected by
EEG and used to feed a BCI system for di erent
purposes. In fact, imagination movement tasks evoke
EEG signal changes in a way that these changes can
be detected in temporal and spatial traces of EEG
rhythmic components, at speci c electrodes (channels) located on subjects' scalps. Therefore, we can
use electrophysiological properties of motor imagery
as temporal, spatial and frequency characteristics to
detect the mental task. This paper focuses on BCI
systems that are based on translating EEG signals
recorded through motor imagery.
A BCI system consists of units of signal acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection/reduction and classi cation. Signal acquisition
unit records the brain activates such as EEG signals,
while the pre-processing unit increases the signal-to-

73

noise ratio of the signals. On the other side, feature
extraction unit prepares features that are meaningful
to the classi cation stage and omits outlier and artifact
features. Then, the feature selection/reduction unit
reduces the number of features and/or acquisition
channels to decrease the dimension of feature vectors.
Finally, classi cation unit classi es the features into
logical control signals.
Solving a BCI problem includes two phases, i.e.,
the train and test phases. In the train phase, the
parameters of the system are adjusted through learning
from previously recorded samples. In the test phase,
the new data are recorded and its class is estimated
using the parameters adjusted in the train stage. Unfortunately, such algorithms require high-speed computers to process the steps of BCI, limiting their use
and portability. Therefore, an ecient algorithm to
meet these speci cations is needed to be designed. In
order to overcome this shortcoming, using hardware
platforms such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays
(FPGAs), which are more portable, less expensive, and
power ecient, seems reasonable. Moreover, there are
other reasons to use FPGA for implementing a BCI
system. First, the parallelism of FPGAs can be used
for high computational throughput, especially at low
clock rates. Second, FPGAs are more exible and more
power-ecient than processors are. Third, FPGAs are
more suitable for real-time embedded solutions [7].
This paper proposes an ecient high-accurate
algorithm for classi cation of EEG signals for a BCI
system. Moreover, the paper presents an ecient
hardware implementation of the proposed BCI on a
FPGA platform. The proposed algorithm is based
on statistical learning methods, and the hardware
implementation considers the optimization of power,
area, and frequency to meet the targeted speci cations
of end applications. The achieved results show that
the proposed BCI can classify EEG signals from BCI
competition IV (4 classes), BCI competition III (3
classes), and our in-house signals (2 classes) with
accuracy rates of 67.2%, 73.54%, and 81.9%, respectively. The hardware implementation results validate
the successful implementation of the proposed method
on hardware at the clock frequency of 560 kHz.
The remainder of this paper is organized as
follows: In Section 2, the current literature is presented and discussed; in Section 3, all datasets used
in this paper are presented; Section 4 describes the
proposed methodology for the BCI system. Section 5
shows the simulation results of software, and Section 6
discusses signal processing concerns for hardware implementation. The detailed hardware implementation
is presented in Section 7. Section 8 discusses some
trade-o s between accuracy and hardware resources. In
Section 9, the obtained hardware experimental results
are reported. Finally, Section 10 concludes the paper.

2. Previous work
There is a rich literature addressing the research in BCI
systems, where each paper may consider a speci c part
of the system. The related literature can be divided
into two main categories: algorithms and hardware
implementation. In the following, state-of-the-art work
from each category is brie y described.

2.1. Previous work on algorithms

There exists a large amount of literature on BCI
algorithms and methods. Two main sub-categories are
methods of feature extraction and those of classi cation:
1. Feature Extraction: Adaptive Auto-Regressive
(AAR) is one of the suitable algorithms to extract
features from EEG signals [8-10]. A classical
approach to estimating time-varying AR-parameter
is the segmentation-based approach. In this case,
the data are divided into short segments and the
AR parameters are estimated from each segment.
The shorter the segment length, the higher the
time resolution; however, it has the disadvantage
of an increasing error in AR estimations. The AAR
model appropriately describes the random behavior
of EEG signals and provides parameters with a high
time resolution. Moreover, by using AAR model, it
is not necessary to use frequency band [11]. In [12],
an AR model is utilized because of achieving better
estimations of short time series compared to Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT). AAR can also be used to
remove artifacts, such as eye blinking and muscle
movements, from EEG data, based on blind source
separation [13].
However, the AR model cannot capture the
transient features in EEG data, and the timefrequency information is not easily seen in the AR
parameters [14]. Therefore, several researchers have
used wavelet coecients that provide localization
of signal components with spectro-temporal characteristics [15-19]. The main bene t of wavelets is the
time-frequency localization. The advantage of timefrequency localization is that the wavelet analysis
changes the time-frequency aspect ratio, providing
a good frequency localization at low frequencies
for long time windows and good time localization
at high frequencies for short time windows [20].
On the other hand, the Power Spectral Density
(PSD) is another approach that indicates the distribution of power of a signal between di erent
frequencies [21].
Various other algorithms have also been proposed that extract features in spectral or spatial
domains such as the Common Spatial Patterns
(CSP), classifying brain tasks. In fact, CSP, using
the variance as a new feature, tries to extract

features that are able to maximize the variance of
a particular task and minimize the variance of the
other [22]. A signi cant drawback of CSP is that
it does not consider the spectral characteristics of
the EEG signal [23]. To overcome this problem,
many researchers have proposed several variants
of CSP [24-27]. One of the promising algorithms
for the feature extraction, which is an advanced
version of CSP, is called Filter Bank Common
Spatial Patterns (FBCSP) whose advantage is that
it considers the spectral characteristics of the EEG
signals [28,29]. Moreover, an advanced version
of FBCSP is called Separable Common Spatio
Spectral Pattern (SCSSP) [30], which overcomes
all shortcomings of FBCSP, i.e., the high computational cost of training, lack of analysis of both
spatial and spectral characteristics of signals, and
lack of having a metric to rank the discriminatory
power of extracted spatio-spectral features. In addition, CSP methods su er from sensitivity to noise
and, also, over tting. In order to overcome these
problems, di erent methods are proposed in the
literature for regularizing CSP, namely Regularized
CSP (RCSP). In [31], various RCSP algorithms are
reviewed and summarized, as well as the standard
CSP. Thereafter, four novel RCSP methods are
proposed and evaluated which outperform previous
RCSP methods.
2. Classi cation: Linear classi ers, such as Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Linear Support
Vector Machine (SVM), can be applied to distinguish classes using linear functions [32]. Methods
such as [33-36] have used these classi ers in BCI
systems. LDA is suitable for online BCI systems
because of a low computational cost, which persuades researchers to use it in motor imagery-based
BCI systems. However, the main shortcoming of
LDA is its linearity that can provide poor results
on complicated nonlinear EEG data [37]. LDA
can also be used for feature reduction in EEG
signals [38], as is used in the proposed method, too.
On the other hand, Linear-SVM uses a discriminant
hyperplane to classify EEG features. This method
is very popular because of good generalization
properties [39], simplicity in implementation, and
robustness [40]. Nonlinear classi cation, such as
Bayesian and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), are
used in [41-43]. Nonlinear methods show better
classi cation performance than the linear methods;
however, they are more complicated, especially
from the implementation point of view. In spite
of all these e orts, designing an ecient algorithm
for classi cation in BCI systems, while considering
the hardware constraints, is still a major challenge.

2.2. Previous work on hardware

Most of the literature in which a full BCI system is implemented are concentrated on the steady-state visual
Evoked Potential, which is an EEG signal response to
the ickering visual stimulus [44], [45], [46]. However,
in [47], a BCI system is implemented based on motor
imagery, which includes Finite Impulse Response lter
as a preprocessing, CSP as a feature extraction, and
Mahalanobis distance as a classi cation, on Stratix
IV FPGA Board with operational frequency of 200
MHz. This paper proposes a more ecient hardware
implementation with less hardware resources compared
to the design in [47]. A more complete work of [47] is
reported in [48]. A novel approach is introduced in [48],
de ning the tasks and working with devices by a state
machine. The user can do the task or switch to other
tasks by thinking about right and left hand movements.
There exist several other works on BCI systems
with a hardware implementation perspective. For example, Wearable Mobile EEG-based Brain Computer
Interface System (WMEBCIS) [49] is proposed for
detecting drowsiness. A low-cost FPGA-based BCI
multimedia control system is also proposed in [50].
Their proposed framework is used to control multimedia devices. In their work, they use Steady-State Visual
Evoked Potential (SSVEP), which is light-emitting
diode stimulation panel (several command symbols).
SSVEP is also utilized in [51] to control environmental
devices such as television. Controlling hospital bed
nursing system in a FPGA-based BCI system is also
addressed in [52].

2.3. Best-performing methods on BCI
competition datasets

There are reported accuracies on BCI competitions
available in BCI competition web site [53]. The best
reported method (in [54]) on BCI competition IIIdataset V, which has classi ed all three classes of
this dataset, has used LDA to extract features from
PSD values of the EEG signals and distance-based
discriminator for classi cation. The best performing
method (as reported in [55]) on BCI competition IVdataset 2a, which has classi ed all four classes of
this dataset, has employed FBCSP and Naive Bayes
Parzen Window as feature extraction and classi cation,
respectively. However, the main shortcoming of these
methods is that they provide low accuracies and are
not suitable for hardware implementation as they have
high computational complexity.
However, the methods proposed in [31] and [48],
mentioned previously, outperform the best methods
reported in [54] and [55], and can be considered as two
of the best performing methods on BCI competition
IV-dataset 2a. Nonetheless, it should be noticed that
these two methods only classify the rst two classes
(movements of right and left hands).

3. Description of datasets
There are two available methods for recording the EEG
signals, i.e., invasive and non-invasive methods. The
former implants the electrodes in the brain through an
operation; thus, it can be dangerous and harmful to
the brain. However, the latter records the signals by
electrodes on the head skin. In order to standardize
the placement of the electrodes on the head, the 1020 standard has been introduced. In this standard,
the distance of adjacent electrodes from each other
is 10% or 20% of the whole distance between back
(inion) and front (nasion) of the skull. This standard
has improved over the years and has multiple versions.
Figure 2 depicts the locations of almost all sensors in
these standards.
Recording brain signals in the non-invasive approach is commonly called Electroencephalograph
(EEG) [56]. The EEG method has some advantages
and disadvantages. In fact, a lower price, high
time resolution, and robustness of movement could be
mentioned as its advantages, and low SNR, distilled
water requirement and low spatial resolution are its
disadvantages.
Capturing EEG signals, in the lab, consists of
multiple steps. After the appearance of the xation
cross, a cue is performed to warn the experienced person to start thinking about a particular task, which is
the motor imagery step. The last step is resting, which
happens before starting the next experiment. Figure 3
illustrates the steps of the EEG signal capturing.
In this paper, three datasets are used to verify the
proposed algorithm, which are detailed in the sequel.

3.1. BCI competition III - dataset V

One of the datasets used to evaluate the proposed
algorithm is dataset V of BCI competition III [53].
This dataset was created by IDIAP Research Institute.
Recorded signals are brain signals from three di erent
persons, each of which is involved in the experiment for
four times. All these four experiments were performed
in one day with 5-10 minutes break between every
session. The sampling rate is 512 Hz and 32 channels
have been used to record the signals. There are both
raw signals and power spectral densities available in
this dataset; however, only raw signals are used in
this paper. In this dataset, each person is asked to
think about the following three tasks in di erent time
slots:




Imagination of repetitive self-paced left-hand movements;
Imagination of repetitive self-paced right-hand
movements;
Generation of words beginning with the same random letter.

3.3. Captured signals

paradigm. The paradigm includes xation cross and cue
followed by motor imagery and rest.

3.2. BCI competition IV - dataset 2a

The second dataset used in this paper is dataset 2a
of BCI competition IV [53], consisting of signals from
nine people. Signals from each person are captured in
two sessions on di erent days. Each session consists
of 6 parts and each part includes 48 experiments. In
each experiment, every person is asked to do one of the
following four motor imagery tasks:





Imagination of left-hand movements;
Imagination of right-hand movements;
Imagination of both legs movements;
Imagination of tongue movements.

The sampling rate is 50 Hz and data are ltered
by a band-pass Butterworth lter.

In order to devise a local platform to evaluate the
algorithms, we managed to record EEG signals by
an Emotiv® system, including 14 channels with the
sampling rate of 128 Hz. The EEG electrodes have
been placed in locations AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7,
P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, and AF4 based
on International 10-20 system (see Figure 2). Eight
persons were asked to imagine performing one of the
following two tasks in each experiment:



Imagination of left-hand movements;
Imagination of right-hand movements.

Four experimental sessions were held in one day,
each of them including 30 experiments. All subjects
were sitting on a comfortable armchair in front of a
computer screen during the recording session. A session takes eight seconds, including two seconds to show
a xation cross on the black screen at the beginning of
session, one second for a cue pointing either to the left
or right on the display, three seconds for performing
the corresponding task in front of the black screen to
avoid visual feedback, and two seconds in order to relax
their minds (see Figure 3). The rst three experimental
sessions are used as training data, and the last one is
used as test data. Before starting to record, all subjects
were asked to practice with the experimental conditions

2. Laplacian Filter: One of the most important
limitations of EEG signals is their poor spatial
resolution. One common technique in order to
alleviate this problem is the Surface Laplacian (SL)
ltering [58]. It is also used to remove the noises
and artifacts whose origin may be outside of the
skull [59], which eventually improves the Signal-toNoise Ratio (SNR). There are four di erent spatial
lters, namely standard ear reference, Common
Average Reference (CAR), small Laplacian and the
large Laplacian. We employed the CAR method
as it has been proven that the CAR is suitable
for a communication system related to and
rhythms, which are the main frequency bands (8-12
Hz and 12-32 Hz, respectively) (some works, such
as [60,61], cite the range of rhythm as 18-30 Hz)
for motor imagery EEG signals [62]. In fact, in
the CAR method, the potential of each channel
(electrode) is subtracted by a weighted average of
the next-nearest neighbor channels, according to
their distance. If the distances are equal, it can
be easily formulated as follows:
H (z ) =

method. The proposed method consists of signal
acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction, feature
selection, feature reduction, and nally classi cation.

for ve minutes in order to reduce their stress and
increase their concentration by becoming familiar with
conditions. Subjects were asked not to move or blink
during these three seconds of motor tasks in order to
reduce the e ects of artifacts such as electromyogram
(EMG) and electrooculography (EOG). Signals were
ltered by a highpass lter with 0.1 Hz cut-o frequency and, then, ltered by a notch lter with the
frequency of 50 Hz to remove the power line e ect.
Moreover, note that, in the captured signals, subject
7 is about 60 years old, and the other subjects are
young, around 23. The signi cant di erence between
the accuracy rates for subject 7 compared to the other
subjects might be due to the older age of this subject.

4. Methodology
The method in this paper consists of several computational blocks, utilized in both train and test phases.
Figure 4 shows di erent parts of this method. Each
part will be discussed in detail in the following.

4.1. Pre-processing

Preprocessing, which tries to remove noises and artifacts, is crucial to obtaining high classi cation accuracy
in BCI systems. In the proposed method, two techniques, i.e., DC-block and Laplacian lter, are used for
this purpose.
1. DC-block: Filtering is an important step to remove
unnecessary information from raw signals. In this
paper, the xed point DC blocker [57] is applied
to remove the DC shifts. The DC component
in EEG signals varies between di erent recording
runs, even for a speci c subject. This component
does not include any information regarding the
motor imagery task and may degrade the accuracy
of the algorithm. Based on this fact and for
the sake of achieving stability during all recording
runs, the DC component should be omitted by
means of a DC lter. An e ective solution from
the hardware implementation point of view is the
DC-blocker, which performs the DC ltering by
means of minimum hardware resources based on the
following equation [57]:

ViCAR = ViER

n
1X
V ER ;
n j =1 j

(2)

where ViER is the potential between the ith electrode and the reference, and n is the number of
electrodes in the montage.

4.2. Feature extraction

Feature extraction is the process of distinguishing
pertinent signal characteristic (i.e., features related to
the user's intent) from unnecessary contents. The most
popular methods in this eld are AAR, wavelet-based,
PSD and SCSSP, described in the sequel.
1. AAR: Autoregressive (AR) method is a simple,
yet ecient, method for describing probabilistic
behavior of a time sequence. In this paper, AAR
is used for the adaptive estimation of the AR
parameters [9]. The mathematical expression of
this method can be written as follows:
yk =

kX1

i= k p

ai yi + xk ;

(3)

where xk is a Gaussian noise with zero mean and
variance x2 , parameter p is the degree of AR model,
and ai 's are AR coecients. Moreover, k is a
positive number, denoting the number of samples
and is related to the signal duration as k = t  f0 ,
where f0 is the sampling frequency.
2. Wavelet: This method is able to produce good

78

A. Malekmohammadi et al./Scientia Iranica, Special Issue on: Socio-Cognitive Engineering 26 (2019) 72{94

frequency localization in the time window, which is,
in particular, appropriate for signals with transient
nature such as EEG. The Wavelet coecients are
obtained through decomposition of the signal into
di erent frequency bands. This decomposition is
performed in multiple stages by means of consecutive low-pass and high-pass signal ltering. In this
paper, this method is applied to nd the coecients
of the frequency bands of and rhythms as
features of EEG signals.
3. PSD: In this method, the power of the signal between di erent frequencies is considered as features.
Herein, the value of PSD is computed in each 2 Hz
frequency band within the 8-30 Hz to cover and
rhythms [21].
4. SCSSP: Separable Common Spatio Spectral Pattern (SCSSP), proposed in [30], improves the Common Special Patterns (CSP) method [22]. This
method selects proper features of the signals as
illustrated in Figure 5. Let us consider an EEG
experiment with Nch channels (electrodes) and Ni
samples. After passing these signals through a set
of Nf band-pass lters, Ni matrices with the size of
Nf  Nch are obtained. Let X denote a Nf  Nch
matrix, and then its spectral (i ) and special ( i )
covariance matrices are computed as follows:

desired eigenvectors (WL and WR ) and eigenvalues
(L and R ) are calculated.

where Li[k] and Rj [k] are components of L and R
eigenvalue matrices, respectively, and k is between 1
and Nf Nch k s values are then sorted in descending order, and the rst d is selected in order to
determine the corresponding indices i[k] and j [k].
Therefore, the features are obtained as follows:
T
yk = wL;i

where wL;i[k] and wR;j [k] are the eigenvectors in

yk can also be found as follows:
yk = (wR;j [k]

wL;i[k] )T X;

(8)

where denotes Kronecker product.
It is suggested to use the normalized log-power
features instead, which are calculated as follows:


where Ni is the number of training samples X .
Then, by solving the generalized eigenvalue problems in Eq. (5):
1 WL = (1 + 2 )WL L ;

Following this calculation, components k are
computed as follows:

var(yk )
zk = log P

where zk is the kth feature. The feature vector is
then constructed as Z = [z1 ; zNf Nch ; :::]T .
Notice that the SCSSP method is a binaryclassi cation algorithm. To generalize it for multi-class
purposes, several auxiliary approaches, such as OneVersus-Rest (OVR), can be used.
Finally, the band-pass ltering is performed using
Chebyshev type II lters of order 6 and bandwidth of
4 Hz. A total of Nf = 4 lters are used to cover and

Figure 5. Structure of SCSSP algorithm. The EEG signals with Ni samples obtained from Nch channels pass through Nf
band-pass lters, and a three-dimensional matrix with the size of Nf  Nch  Ni is obtained. Afterwards, the SCSSP
algorithm extracts proper features out of it, as explained in the manuscript.

rhythms. The reasons for using this type of lter are
as follows: IIR lters need extremely fewer coecients
than FIR lters do; therefore, they require much less
hardware resources to implement in comparison to FIR
lters. Hence, an IIR lter type is applied. Among
IIR lters, Elliptic and Chebyshev type I lters have
ripples in their band pass, causing adverse in uence
on the nal results. The Chebyshev type II Filter
is sharper in the cut-o frequency than Butterworth
Filter is. Therefore, better accuracy can be expected
from Chebyshev type II lter.

4.3. Normalization

Normalization of features limits their dynamic range
and improves the accuracy of the algorithm. It can be
performed in both linear and non-linear forms. Assume
that mk and k are mean and standard deviation of the
kth dimension of feature vector (Z ), respectively:
mk =
k2 =

N

i=1

(10)

Zik ;

N

1 i=1

(Zik

mk )2 ; k = 1; 2; :::; l;

(11)

where N is the number of training samples. Then,
the linear normalization of the train and test Zk is
calculated as follows:
Z mk
:
(12)
Z^k = k
k

where p(:) denotes the probability function. The
more independent variables Z and classes are, the
less mutual information the feature will have. It
should be noted that the output value of I is
always greater than zero. Features satisfying higher
quantity of MI with regard to the classes are
selected as better features [63-65].

4.5. Feature reduction

After selecting proper features, still many of them may
have dummy information. To reduce the dimension of
features, several methods have been proposed, two of
which are described in the following:
1. LDA: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), also
known as Fisher LDA, is a popular method for
dimension reduction and classi cation [66]. The
important advantage of LDA is that it amends
and improves the total achieved accuracy while
providing a very simple methodology. As LDA
requires very low computational complexity, it is
a worthy selection for BCI systems [67].
LDA projects the data using a transformation
matrix W onto a new space with lower dimensions.
If the number of classes is C , the new feature
dimension (d) will be C 1. LDA tries to minimize
within-class scatter Sw and maximize between-class
scatter Sb formulated as follows:
Sw =

4.4. Feature election

To reduce the number of obtained features eciently,
the following two methods can be used:
1. FDR: Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR) is a ratio
that considers the best features by maximizing
the distance between the means of the classes and
minimizing the variance within each class. Features
that satisfy longer FDR are better ones to be
selected.
If i and i denote the mean and standard
deviation of feature Zk in the ith class, respectively,
the FDR for this feature is calculated as follows:
FDR =

C X
C
X

(i j )2
;
2 + j2
i=1 j =1 i

(13)

where C is the number of classes. A higher FDR
value implies that the feature has a better contrast
to classify classes.
2. MI: The mutual information I (Z; !) between variable Z from the feature space and class labels
! = f!1 ; !2 ; :::; !c g is de ned as follows:
I (Z ; ! ) =

c

(16)

where zij is the ith sample of class j , j is the
mean of class j , ni is the number of samples in
class j , and  is the mean of means of all classes.
The transformation matrix W and, therefore, the
new feature space are constructed by eigenvectors
corresponding to the biggest eigenvalues (d = C 1)
of Sw 1 Sb matrix. The new features are obtained
by projection of features onto this new feature
space.
2. PCA: Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is
another popular method for dimension reduction
which uses an orthogonal transformation, Y =
W T Z , to convert data Z into uncorrelated data
Y . Matrix W is constructed by eigenvectors
of the covariance matrix of Z data corresponding to the largest d eigenvalues, containing most
information of original space. By comparing
LDA and PCA methods, one can easily see that
LDA increases the resolution between classes,
while PCA reduces the error of data compression.

4.6. Classi cation

There are many methods available for classi cation.
The following classi cation methods are tested in this
work:
1. KNN: K -Nearest Neighbor is a simple classi cation
method that nds K nearest neighbors from the
training data for each new point in testing data.
The class with the largest number of samples among
K samples is the winner class for the test sample.
The distance is calculated using these following
measures: (I) Euclidean distance, (II) Absolute
distance.
2. Bayes: Supposing that the data is D-dimensional
as x = [x1 ; :::; xD ]T , the probability distribution of
dimension xd over all the training samples of class
j is as follows:
1
p(xd jclass : j ) = q

 p(xd j class : j );
/ arg max
j d=1

(18)

because when uniform probability distribution is
assumed for classes, p(class : j ) can be discarded.
3. SVM: Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the
well-known classi cation algorithms and has been
widely used in BCI due to its simplicity. SVM constructs hyperplanes to separate the feature vectors
into several classes. These hyperplanes maximize
the margins, that is, the distance between the
nearest training samples and the hyperplanes [68].
The goal during the training process is to nd
the separating hyperplane with the possible largest
margin from the edge of classes [66].

If there are C classes indexed by j =

In this paper, for each part of the system, several
methods were investigated and tested to nd the
optimum approach. Given the fact that the algorithm
was going to be implemented on hardware, all values
were considered xed point in experiments performed
in MATLAB. Twenty bits were found to be sucient
for each value of each channel, in which 11 bits
were considered for the decimal part, 8 bits for the
integer section, and one sign bit. The number of bits
is carefully determined using the bit-loading process.
This means that through extensive simulations, the
dynamic ranges of the variables were monitored and
logged. As shown in Figure 6(a), the number of bits
associated to fractional part suces to be 11 to have
stable and good total accuracy in the experiments.

Figure 7. Final structure of the proposed method. DC block and surface Laplacian pre-process data. SCSSP, mutual
information, LDA, and SVM are respectively selected to be used for feature extraction, selection, reduction, and
classi cation.

Moreover, Figure 6(b) veri es that 20 bits are sucient
for representing the whole number in this work.
Among feature extraction methods, SCSSP performs better than others do, for all di erent classi cation methods (see Table 1). Therefore, SCSSP is
the best choice for the feature extraction. As can
be seen in this table, the normalization of features
improves the accuracy rate by 5.4%. MI and LDA
methods perform the best among feature selection and
reduction methods, respectively. The results show
that Bayesian approach outperforms other classi cation methods with a slight improvement compared to
the linear SVM. However, because of its low implementation cost on hardware, linear SVM is selected
for classi cation in this work (in the next sections,
the numeric comparisons of linear SVM and Bayesian
classi ers are reported for both software and hardware
implementations). In conclusion, the nal structure of
the proposed method is depicted in Figure 7.
Overall results of the algorithm (for complete
number of classes) are listed in Table 1, showing better
performance than the best reported results of BCI
competitions [54,55] and also recent state-of-the-art
papers [31,48] for both datasets (67.2% for BCI competition IV, dataset 2a; 73.54% for BCI competition
III, dataset V). Moreover, the results show a high
performance of 81.9% for captured signals, re ecting
the excellent performance of the proposed algorithm.
Notice that, in the captured dataset, as mentioned
in Section 3.3, subject 7 is much older than the
other subjects are. This may explain the signi cant
di erence between the accuracy rates of this subject
and the other subjects.
Several recent state-of-the-art papers working on
motor imagery (such as [31,48]) have considered merely
two classes of right- and left-hand movements for
experiments. To compare the proposed method with
similar state-of-the-art methods, we evaluate this work
with two mentioned classes, too. The experiment
is performed on BCI competition IV, dataset 2a.
According to Table 1, this work outperforms [31] with
a slight improvement; however, it does not reach the
performance of [48]. One of the reasons for not
outperforming [48] is that our proposed system tries

to make a balance between accuracy and hardware
eciency by considering hardware issues, too, while
accuracy is a matter of much concern in [48] resulting
in lower hardware eciency. The other reasons for
the lower accuracy of our proposed method, compared
to [48] and some details of [31] and [48], are explained
in the following.
This work di ers from [31] in some important
items. First, in [31], several additional subjects are
used as a prior knowledge (for regularization) in the
training phase. Obviously, the use of additional subjects in training improves the performance. Additional
subjects might not be always available. Secondly,
they have not proposed the hardware implementation
of their method; thus, their simulations are in the
oating point while the reported results of this paper
are in xed-point. In fact, the software experiments
of the proposed method in this paper are performed
in xed point in order to be realistic for hardware
implementation. Third, [31] uses CSP and RCSP, while
this work uses SCSSP which has signi cant advantages
over CSP method. Fourth, they have used three pairs
(Nf = 3 pairs) Butterworth lters with order 5, while
four (Nf = 4) Chebyshev lters are used in this work
with order 6.
In [48], a motor imagery embedded system is
proposed in both hardware and software frameworks.
Their method consists of adjusting lters in preprocessing, using the CSP method for feature extraction and utilizing Mahalanobis distance as a classi er.
Several di erences between [48] and this work are as
follows. First, in [48], the lter is optimized for each
subject according to intrinsic characteristics of the
subject. However, identical lters are used for all
subjects in this paper. For instance, for the best total
accuracy in [48], the degrees of optimum FIR lters
for subjects S2, S4, and S6 are respectively 221, 146,
and 442. However, the orders of Chebyshev lters
in this paper are all six, which are much easier to
implement and consume much less area and power
in hardware. Second, because of this optimization of
every subject, [48] is subject-dependent in contrast to
the proposed method in this paper. Being subjectdependent has serious disadvantages, such as the need

In addition, in contrast to evaluations of this work, experiments in [31] are in oating point simulation.
2 In [48], in contrast to this work, the lters are not identical for all subjects, and lter of each subject is
optimized according to the subject's characteristics. Therefore, [48] is subject-dependent.
Moreover, the orders of lters are signi cantly high in comparison to orders of lters in this work.

subjects, having slower training phase, diculty in the
expansion and mass production, etc. Third, in [48], the
ratio of training to test samples is 60%/40%. However,
the ratio of the training to test in the standard BCI

competition IV, dataset 2a, is 50%/50%, which is used
in our work for evaluation. In addition, as is reported
in the following sections, this work in this paper highly
outperforms [48] in the total consumed power.

number of classes. As can be seen, the projected classes are well distinguished: (a) Imaginations of movement of left hand,

left hand and right hand, and generation of words projected in a two-dimensional LDA projection space, and (c)

si ed tasks by the proposed method. This gure
illustrates the scatter of feature points output from
LDA block. Figure 8(a) belongs to subject S7 of
BCI competition IV. Because this dataset contains
four classes, the dimension of feature vector from LDA
output is of three. Figure 8(b) shows the rst subject
of BCI competition III, which has three classes. Thus,
as it can be seen, features are two-dimensional. Figure 8(c) shows captured signals. In this dataset, there
are two classes, and the dimension of feature vector of
LDA output is one. However, for better visualization,
the horizontal axis is added as a dummy dimension,
which represents the index of samples. As is obvious
in this gure, notably high separability between classes
has been achieved as a result of optimum blocks used
in this method.

chosen to be four, so that these lters can cover alpha
(8-12 Hz) and beta (12-16 Hz, 16-20 Hz, 20-24 Hz)
frequency bands. The Chebyshev lter with order 6 is
used for each lter path.

6. Signal processing concerns for hardware
implementation

Another parameter that a ects the implementation is
the number of channels. This parameter a ects the
clock rate of the DC-block, Laplacian lter, Chebyshev
lter, and SCSSP module. The number of channels is
set to 14 in the third dataset.

In this section, issues relevant to the BCI system
performance will be studied. Some parameters, such as
the number of lter banks, the number of channels, the
number of classes, and the number of features, a ect
the resulting hardware area. Thus, their values must be
known before the hardware design. The dataset used
for implementation is the third one (captured signals).

6.1. Number of lter banks

As previously mentioned, the EEG signals must pass
the lter banks before applying the SCSSP algorithm.
The number of banks should be ecient with regard
to both the achieved accuracy and the hardware implementation cost. In this case, the number of lters is

6.2. Number of classes

Another critical option is to choose the number of
classes, in uencing some parameters of LDA and SCSSP algorithms. In addition, it a ects the classi cation design directly, because the basic SVM is only
applicable to binary-class tasks. In order to use the
SVM method for classi cation tasks with more than
two classes, one-versus-all or one-versus-one approach
can be used. In this study, since the hardware is tested
for the third dataset, which contains only two classes,
the number of classes of dataset is set to two.

6.3. Number of channels

6.4. Number of features

The number of features, set to 40, in uences the
transfer matrix dimension of LDA used to reduce the
number of features and SCSSP units, which generate
the best features before applying LDA.

7. Hardware implementation
Herein, a two-class case is implemented as an instance
of implementation. This implementation can be easily
generalized to the case of more than two classes. Appli-

84

cations of two-class case are very wide, such as moving
the head of hospital bed up/down by thinking about
movements of right/left hand. This can especially help
patients with disabilities in moving body. There are
also various applications in smart homes, where turning
on and o the electrical devices can be performed by
merely thinking about right and left hand movements.
In addition, as mentioned in Section 2, recently in the
literature, it has been proposed to code several tasks
in a state machine using only the right- and left-hand
signals [48].
In this work, solely, the testing phase of classication is implemented in hardware, as training can
be performed beforehand and there is no need to
implement it. The training phase can be done in
software such as MATLAB or C language (MATLAB is
used in this work), and the resulted coecients can be
saved and used for the test phase, which is implemented
in hardware.

7.1. Implementation of DC-block

The rst block in the proposed BCI system is the DCblock, with the structure, illustrated in Figure 9. As
can be seen in this gure, it consists of one adder, one
constant multiplier, and one subtractor. Because there
are 14 parallel data channels that need to be ltered
independently, there is a need for 14 parallel DC-block
cores.
In such a situation, by means of applying the
folding technique on the multiplier module (i.e., to
design the DC-block with only one multiplier for all
input channels), the silicon area minimization is enhanced. This achievement is obtained by sacri cing the
throughput. However, because of the large sampling
frequency of the recording device that is equal to
128 Hz for Emotiv® system, such a decrease in the
throughput can be overlooked. As marked in Figure 9,
the critical path of this core consists of only one
multiplier and one adder, resulting in the operational
frequency of up to 132 MHz, which is fast enough to
handle such a low-frequency EEG signal.

7.2. Implementation of Laplacian lter

As stated in the previous sections, the Laplacian lter
is based on the CAR algorithm, in which the mean
of all channels is subtracted from all of them. The
structure of this core is shown in Figure 10. There is
one adder to compute the sum of all channels. The
division of the output by the number of channels is
realized through simple shift operations. In this way, a
signi cant area and power can be saved, i.e., 141 = 161 +
1
1
128 + 1024 = 0:0713. As shown in Figure 10, the critical
path of this module consists of two adders. Therefore,
the operation frequency of this module can be up to 234
MHz. The minimum speed of this module with respect
to the sampling frequency of 128 Hz can be found based
1
14
on the following equation: 14
x + x + x in which x is
the minimum limit of the operation frequency, which is
3718 Hz.

7.3. Implementation of Chebyshev lter

Separable Common Spatio-Spectral Patterns (SCSSP) [30] are used to extract features of motor-imagery
tasks. In this algorithm, input data goes through a
bank of band-pass lters in the frequency ranges of 812 Hz ( band) and 12-30 Hz ( band). We have used
Chebyshev II band-pass lter of order 6. The block
diagram of this lter is illustrated in Figure 11. In
this gure, bi and ai parameters are the nominator and
denominator coecients of this lter, respectively. It is
important to note that this lter can be implemented
by means of 12 multipliers (there are two constants and
two zero coecients). Each lter bank should be applied to all input channels simultaneously, and it ends
up in a number of 168 (12  14) multipliers per lter
bank, leading to 672 (4168) multipliers with a bank of
four lters, which is not feasible for implementation. In
order to overcome this limitation, the folding technique
is used between 14 input channels at each lter to
reduce the total number of multipliers from 672 to 48
(4  12), resulting in a signi cant reduction in area and
power consumption in this module. The critical path
of this module consists of two multipliers and seven

adders; however, it is improved by means of retiming
technique to reduce this path to only one multiplier
and two adders, resulting in maximum frequency of
about 106 MHz. The latency of this module is 99
(1 + 14  (6 + 1)) clock cycles. Therefore, the minimum
limit of the operational frequency in this module should
be 12.3 kHz (99  128 Hz).

7.4. Implementation of SCSSP

After applying the proposed band pass lters, the
SCSSP [30] core should be applied to the ltered
data, in order to extract corresponding features of
motor-imagery tasks. The functional structure of this
algorithm is summarized in Figure 12. As is shown in
this gure, ltered vector X consists of 4  14 elements

from all 14 channels and 4 lters at a time instance.
This vector should be multiplied by the \NewT" matrix
that consists of 40 sub-matrices with size of 414 (there
are 40 features), whose elements are determined during
the train phase of the experiment. The matrix \NewT"
is (wR;j [k] wL;i[k] )T , where wR;j [k] and wL;i[k] are
the eigenvectors in WR and WL corresponding to jR[k]
and iL[k] , explained in SCSSP section. The result is
named \Tmpt" vector, whose elements are squared to
construct \Tmpt2" vector. This procedure is repeated
after receiving the next sample whose \Tmpt2" vector
is added to the previous \Tmpt2". This job is repeated
for 3  fs (128 Hz) times. After that, the new
\Tmpt2" vector is decomposed to 2 parts due to the
number of classes. Each part of the vector consists
of 20 elements. The next step is to sum up these
elements so that each part of these vectors is divided
by its corresponding sum result. The implementation
of the logarithmic function is also implemented by the
following equivalency:

An overview of di erent stages in SCSSP algorithm is marked by means of black hexagons in
Figure 12. Each stage is a sub-module and designed
to dictate a total critical path of one adder and one
multiplier for the whole design, which was made possible using an e ective pipelining technique speci cally
in the divider and Arctanh operations, in addition to
the folding and retiming techniques used in the design.
These e orts resulted in an e ective high-speed feature
extraction operating at 102 MHz clock speed. The
minimum speed of the operational frequency in this
module is 560 kHz.

7.5. Implementation of normalization

After feature extraction, the features should be normalized. To reach this goal, test features should be
subtracted from the average of train features and,
then, divided into standard deviation of train features.

A. Malekmohammadi et al./Scientia Iranica, Special Issue on: Socio-Cognitive Engineering 26 (2019) 72{94

87

Figure 13. Block diagram of the proposed hardware implementation for normalization. Notice that the mean and

standard deviation of training data (Eqs. (10) and (11)) are calculated erstwhile in the software and are used here as
constant vectors. This gure illustrates the implementation of Eq. (12).

The block diagram of normalization is illustrated in
Figure 13. The latency of this module is 40 clock
periods. The number of clocks taken to generate output
for each feature is 27. Since there are 40 features,
it can be concluded that the number of total clocks
for this part is 40  27 + 40 = 1120. Therefore,
the minimum operational frequency of this module is
1120  128 = 143360 Hz. The maximum speed of this
module can be up to 267 MHz.

7.6. Implementation of MI

After normalization, appropriate features should be
chosen. Fortunately, this part does not require any
hardware. In a training stage, the indices of features
are determined. Therefore, according to the index,
the corresponding elements of the feature vectors are
selected in a test stage. To explain better, the
maximum number of features is set to 40, which is
found to work for all subjects. In the training phase,
mutual information module nds the best indices and
the number of features for every subject. This training is performed in software, as explained previously.
Then, those elements of transformation matrix (LDA
module), corresponding with those numbers of features
which are not chosen by mutual information, will
be replaced with zeros (masking). Therefore, those
numbers of acceptable features are only calculated in
LDA module in the testing phase. In the testing
phase, a masking process is performed merely in LDA
module in order to select the best-found features out
of 40 features. Note that, consequently, altering the
number of features does not a ect the hardware at
all. In conclusion, no hardware resources are required
to implement mutual information module since the
features are selected in the training phase.

7.7. Implementation of LDA

After choosing the best features, their dimension
should be reduced. This reduction can be performed
by means of the LDA algorithm, which was discussed

previously. In this algorithm, at the train stage, a
key matrix is generated. If eigenvectors of this matrix
consist of d elements (here, d = 40), then the dimension
of this matrix must be (C 1)  d, where C is the
number of classes. Hence, after multiplying the matrix
of selected features by the eigenvectors, the dimension
of output vector will be C 1. Herein, due to the
classi cation of left- and right-hand movement motorimagery tasks, C is equal to 2 and the output is a scalar
number. The block diagram of this multiplication is
depicted in Figure 14. In this module, the critical
path consists of one multiplier and one adder, and
the maximum speed of this module can be up to 203
MHz. The latency of this module is 40 clock periods;
therefore, the minimum operational frequency of this
module should be 5128 (40  128) Hz.

7.8. Implementation of SVM

The last core in the data ow is the classi er. This core
is designed based on the Linear-SVM algorithm. The
main reason for choosing the linear classi er is its simplicity and eciency in hardware implementation. The
block diagram of this core is shown in Figure 15. Based
on this gure, the critical path consists of just one multiplier. Therefore, the maximum operational frequency
of this module is around 211 MHz. The latency of this
module is 2 clock periods; consequently, the minimum
limit of the speed of this core is 256 (2  128) Hz.
It is also worth mentioning that implementing
non-linear SVM requires adding a non-linear function
block to obtain the non-linear function of the dot product between the support vectors and the test vector.

8. Trade-o of accuracy and hardware
resources
As mentioned before, linear SVM is preferred to
Bayesian classi er in this work. The detailed comparison of these two classi ers in terms of performance
results and hardware resources is reported in Table 2.

of (C 1)  40 = 1  40, and the input vector X [n] is a 40  1 vector. By multiplying these two vectors, a scalar output is
obtained. The multiplication of these vectors is the same as inner product, and the multiplications of elements are
accumulated using an adder. Note that the matrix of eigenvectors is obtained formerly through software.

As can be seen in this table, the Bayesian classi er
slightly outperforms linear SVM in accuracy, while its
hardware resource usage is signi cantly higher and is
also much slower than SVM, making it not suitable for
motor imagery systems in which fast decision-making is
crucial. The very small improvement in accuracy while
causing a signi cant increase in hardware usage and
latency is not encouraging. Moreover, note that power
is one of the main concerns in BCI systems ful lled
by choosing linear SVM over Bayesian classi er. Nevertheless, one can prefer better accuracy if hardware
usage is not an important issue.
For showing the trade-o between accuracy and
hardware resources better, di erent permutations of
settings are experimented by excluding/including the
parts from/in the proposed system. The classi cation accuracy as well as the consumed power of the
experiments are reported by a Pareto optimal graph
illustrated in Figure 16. The settings of di erent
experiments (points) in this gure are listed in Table 3. Experiments 1 and 9 in this Pareto optimal
graph are the experiments detailed in Table 2. The
Pareto optimal graph clearly shows that there exists a
trade-o between classi cation accuracy and hardware
eciency, and some settings are the best ones among
the possible settings. As can be seen in Figure 16,
experiments 1, 3, and 4 are the Pareto optimal points
from which the setting of experiment 1 is chosen as
the nal setting in this paper, because accuracy is
important in our goal.

numbers show that 20 bits are enough for each value of
every channel in a way that 11 bits are considered for
the decimal part, 8 bits for the integer part, and one

last bit for the sign bit. Thus, the number of bits for
one test vector is 280 (14 channels  20). A new test
vector is processed every 0.0078s (fs = 128 Hz). Since
each person requires three seconds to perform a given
task (see Figure 3), then the number of test vectors for
each experiment is equal to 384 (3  128). Each person
performs 30 experiments including 15 experiments for
the rst class and 15 experiments for the second class
(in our captured dataset).
Retiming and folding techniques were used by
sacri cing the speed, which is justi able because of low
sampling frequency of signal recording. Final structure
satis es maximum frequency of 102 MHz and minimum
frequency of 560 kHz, according to Table 4. Table 4
shows the number of Adders, Subtractors, Multipliers,
Dividers, and Arctan modules used in the proposed
BCI, showing the importance of using folding and

retiming techniques. Note that, for multiplications,
Xilinx multiplication cores (LogiCORE IP Multiplier
v11.2), which are optimized according to inputs of the
core, are utilized. The hardware latency and power of
each section and the total framework are also reported
in Table 4. Moreover, as seen in Table 4, a wide range of
allowed frequencies is provided in this proposed system,
helping to increase frequency and have a satisfying
and acceptable total latency even in a large number
of channels.
The hardware resource usage is reported in Table 5. It can be seen that the total power of this work,
i.e., 83.90 mW, is much less than the total power in
[48], which is 1.067 W. As reported in this table, the
proposed system outperforms [47] and [48] signi cantly
in terms of the number of LUTs, the number of block
RAM/FIFO, the total latency, and the utilized power.

(which is the 6th second according to Figure 3) and ended when prediction becomes ready. In this table, N and D

Notice that identical clock frequency (560 kHz  f  102 MHz) is used in the sections of nal setup. The latency can be obtained

1 The numbers of channels in the hardware implementation are 14, 22, and 22

in this work, [47], and [48], respectively, and the reported latency and power in
this table are set according to these settings. However, note that, according to
Table 4, latency of the proposed system would be  6534  (1=560 kHz)  11:66
ms for N = 22 channels much better than in [47] and [48]. In addition, as
explained in paragraph 3 of Section 9, the hardware is not altered signi cantly by
changing number of channels; therefore, power does not signi cantly change, too.

A. Malekmohammadi et al./Scientia Iranica, Special Issue on: Socio-Cognitive Engineering 26 (2019) 72{94

It outperforms [48] in the number of DSP blocks, too.
The reason of outperforming [48] in the number of
DSP blocks and multipliers is having lters with order
six, while the order of lters increases signi cantly (to,
e.g., 221 and 442) to achieve higher accuracy. On the
other hand, the proposed system outperforms [48] in
terms of block RAM/FIFO which is because most of
the tuned and trained parameters saved in our system
are scalars (e.g., in SVM) or vectors (e.g., in LDA) and
merely one matrix saved for SCSSP. However, more
matrices are required to be saved in [48], which are
the matrices needed for CSP section and covariance
matrix in Mahalanobis distance. Moreover, folding and
retiming techniques help our system have better power
consumption and area. Paper [47], although has the
lower performance rate (72%) on BCI Competition IV
dataset (2 classes), its latency is not completely proper
for practical applications.
Note that, in the proposed system, changing
the number of channels does not alter the utilized
hardware resources too much because normalization,
SVM, and LDA structures are independent of the
number of the channels, and merely some wires and
bits in registers are added in DC-block, Laplacian
lter, Chebyshev lter, and SCSSP. Consequently, the
number of RAM/FIFO and DSP blocks do not change,
while the number of LUTs blocks increases a little and
not signi cantly.

10. Conclusion
This paper proposed an ecient hardware implementation for BCI systems. The proposed system
consists of preprocessing, feature extraction, feature
selection, feature reduction, and classi cation stages.
Software simulations and hardware limitations guided
the method to choose DC-block and surface Laplacian
as preprocessing, SCSSP as feature extractor, MI as
feature selector, LDA as feature reduction method,
and SVM as classi er. Results determined the proper
performance of the proposed system, compared to other
reported results on the used datasets (67.2% for BCI
competition IV, 73.54% for BCI competition III, and
81.9% for captured signals). The system was also eciently implemented and tested on a FPGA hardware
platform. The minimum frequency of BCI system was
560 kHz. Moreover, because of using Folding and
Retiming techniques, the number of resources (LUTs
and block RAM/FIFO) decreased dramatically, on cost
of a few additional DSP blocks.
Blinking can have destructive impact on the
obtained accuracy. By using an appropriate EOG
detection during the mental task, it is possible to
increase the signal-to-noise ratio and, thus, accuracy.
Moreover, in all these experiments, it was known
when the subjects were going to do the mental task.

91

Predicting when subjects are going to think about the
task by extracting ERD/ERS features can be added to
the proposed framework (see Section 3.3 of [69]).
