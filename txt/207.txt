Abstract
Objective: While Parkinson’s disease (PD) has traditionally been described as a movement disorder, there is
growing evidence of disruption in emotion information processing associated with the disease. The aim of this
study was to investigate whether there are specific electroencephalographic (EEG) characteristics that discriminate
PD patients and normal controls during emotion information processing.
Method: EEG recordings from 14 scalp sites were collected from 20 PD patients and 30 age-matched normal
controls. Multimodal (audio-visual) stimuli were presented to evoke specific targeted emotional states such as
happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust. Absolute and relative power, frequency and asymmetry
measures derived from spectrally analyzed EEGs were subjected to repeated ANOVA measures for group
comparisons as well as to discriminate function analysis to examine their utility as classification indices. In addition,
subjective ratings were obtained for the used emotional stimuli.
Results: Behaviorally, PD patients showed no impairments in emotion recognition as measured by subjective
ratings. Compared with normal controls, PD patients evidenced smaller overall relative delta, theta, alpha and beta
power, and at bilateral anterior regions smaller absolute theta, alpha, and beta power and higher mean total
spectrum frequency across different emotional states. Inter-hemispheric theta, alpha, and beta power asymmetry
index differences were noted, with controls exhibiting greater right than left hemisphere activation. Whereas
intra-hemispheric alpha power asymmetry reduction was exhibited in patients bilaterally at all regions. Discriminant
analysis correctly classified 95.0% of the patients and controls during emotional stimuli.
Conclusion: These distributed spectral powers in different frequency bands might provide meaningful information
about emotional processing in PD patients.

Background
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system [1].
Nowadays, PD influences a large part of worldwide
population. About 1% of the population over 55 years of
age is affected by this disease [2]. The motor clinical symptoms of PD such as resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia
and postural instability [3,4] results from dopaminergic

deficiency in the basal ganglia. In addition, PD is also
characterized by the presence of non-motor symptoms
including disruption in emotion information processing
[5], which have been found in over 50% of newly diagnosed
PD patients [6] and can appear in any stage of disease
progression [7].
Individuals with PD show impairments in the ability
to recognize emotions from facial expression [5,8-10],
speech prosody [11,12] and show reduced startle reactivity to highly arousing unpleasant pictures [13,14].
There is sparse event related potential (ERP) evidence
that early processing of emotional prosody (mismatch

negativity [15]) and faces (early posterior negativity [16])
may be affected in PD. While there are also reports of intact emotion recognition [5,16-21], others have documented impairments in recognizing some of the basic
emotions (anger, fear, disgust, happiness, sadness, and
surprise) but not other emotions [9,22]. Most recently,
lateralization (left versus right) of emotion recognition in
PD has been debated. For example, Clark et al. reported
no asymmetry effects on explicit emotion categorization
[8]. Ariatti et al. and Yip et al. reported problems in categorizing disgust prosody in patients with predominantly
right-sided [23,24]. While Ventura et al. reported that
predominantly left sided patient’s exhibit recognition of
sadness emotion [25]. Finally, it is not yet clear whether
deficits appear in recognizing emotion only in one stimulus modality (i.e., facial expressions [8]) or more (facial
displays and prosody [11,23]; facial displays, voices, and
verbs [12]). Altogether, experimental evidence so far supports the view of impairments in emotion processing in
PD. Most studies on emotion recognition mentioned
above dealt with behavioral responses (i.e., participants
were asked to match, to identify, to judge, or to rate the
emotional stimuli) whereas very few studies dealt with
physiological measures (i.e., startle eye blink and ERPs).
Furthermore, PD is characterized by a loss of dopaminergic innervation of the basal ganglia, including the ventral
striatum, and the subthalmic nucleus. These structures
are highly interconnected with, for instance the amygdala
and the orbifrontal cortex, brain regions associated with
emotion recognition [23]. In addition, it is well documented that emotional processing involves a multitude of
processes in several brain circuits. One example is the
somatic marker hypothesis by Damasio, which states that
emotions results from an interpretation of somatic states
[26]. Thus, impairments in the processing of emotional
information by PD patients are also reflected in the characteristics of electrical activation of the brain i.e., electroencephalogram (EEG). In general, due to their noninvasive
recording procedure and temporal resolution, EEG signals
have been widely used in order to study brain activity relating to affective responses. Evidence of such activity is reported in the majority of EEG frequency bands i.e., delta
(δ: 1 – 4 Hz), theta (θ: 4 – 8 Hz), alpha (α: 8 – 13 Hz), beta
(β: 13 – 30 Hz) and gamma (ϒ: 30 – 60 Hz). In line with
results from healthy participant EEG emotion study, one
of the common indicators of emotional states is the
alpha-power asymmetry derived from the spectral differences between a symmetric electrode pair at the anterior
areas of the brain [27]. Other spectral changes and brain
regions were also reported, which are associated with
emotional responses, such as the alpha power changes
at right parietal lobe [28], theta power changes at right
parietal lobe [29], the frontal midline theta power [30],
beta –power asymmetry at the parietal region [31], and

the gamma spectral changes at the right parietal
regions [32].
This study aims to investigate whether differences in
EEG frequency bands, induced by the emotional information could be used to discriminate PD patients and
normal controls (NCs). For this purpose, we utilized traditional EEG spectral measures of absolute and relative
power as well as the measures of EEG mean frequency.
We also studied the functional connectivity between
brain regions by examining inter-hemispheric and intrahemispheric relationships responses to emotional stimuli.
Statistical analysis was used to evaluate the extracted
features between the two groups. To our knowledge, no
study has yet been conducted to explore the correspondence between emotional states and EEG frequency bands
in PD patients.

Materials and methods
Participants

Twenty three PD patients and 30 NC that have been
matched for age, education level, and gender participated in the study. Due to excessive artifacts (body
movements and closing of the eyes), three participants
of the PD group had to be excluded from the further
analysis, resulting in a sample of 20 PD patients (10
men and 10 women) and 30 NC (13 men and 17
women). The PD patients were recruited from the
clinic Neurology outpatient service of the Hospital
University Kebangsaan Malaysia (HUKM) medical center, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. All of them had been diagnosed with idiopathic PD by a neurologist. All
patients were optimally medicated during testing session (ON state) with d2-agonist (n = 18); carbidopa/Ldopa (n = 13), monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor (n = 7), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor (n = 5), amantadine (n = 5), or anticholinergics
(n = 3). The average duration of PD (post-diagnosis) in
the group was 5.75 years [standard deviation (SD) =
3.52, range = 1–12 years]. The severity of motor signs
in the group could be characterized as mild to moderate; all patients fit Hoehn and Yahr stages (H & Y) [33]
I – III (Stage I = unilateral disease with mild symptoms, stage II = bilateral involvement, stage III = bilateral symptoms with postural and gait disturbances)
with a mean Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS) [34] motor score of 17.05 (SD = 3.15). None
of the patients had coexisting neurological (e.g., epilepsy) or psychiatric disturbance (e.g., major depression or anxiety, psychotic symptoms, etc.) that might
independently influence their cognitive functioning.
The healthy control participants were recruited through
the hospital’s medical unit community and/or from patient’s relatives. Exclusion criteria for controls included any
psychiatric or neurological disorder. To exclude dementia

or depression, participants scoring 24 or lower on the
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [16,35] or 18 or
higher on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [15,36]
were excluded. All participants were right-handed as determined by self-report and confirmed by Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI) [37]. This test consisted of 10
questions asking for the preferred hand for a series of activities (e.g. writing, throwing, using scissors, etc.). All participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision,
and intact hearing was formally established in all participants by administering a pure tone audiometric screening
of both ears to ensure acceptable normal hearing threshold
(minimum 30 dB HL at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz, for the better
hearing). All participants/caretaker gave informed consent
before completing the study, which was ethically approved
by the Faculty of Medicine, Institutional Review Board of
the University Kebangsaan Malaysia. All participants were
paid for their participation.
Patients and controls were comparable in demographic
variables such as age (PD: M = 59.05 years, SD = 5.64;
NC: M = 58.43 years, SD = 3.01; t (48) = 0.502, p = 0.61),
gender distribution (PD: 10 men, NC: 13 men; x2 (1, N =
50) = 0.21, p = 0.68), and education level (PD: M =
10.45 years, SD = 4.8; HC: M = 11.02 years, SD = 3.24; t
(48) = −0.62, p = 0.51). As shown in Table 1, PD patients
did not differ in mean MMSE scores, mean BDI scores,
as well as mean EHI scores.
The modeling and classification of emotions

Emotions can be defined as a complex psychophysiological behavior of an individual’s metal state. It is systematically produced by cognitive processes, subjective
feelings, physiological arousal, motivational tendencies,
and behavioral reactions [38]. In recent years, the emotions have been studied in various fields such as cognitive
science, psychology, behavioral science and human computer interaction. Researchers across these disciplines
have agreed on two categories of emotional models. The
first category includes the discrete emotional model

Page 3 of 19

(DEM) where the objective is to recognize the universally
accepted six basic emotions namely happiness sadness,
fear, anger, disgust and surprise [39]. On the other hand,
affective dimensional model (ADM) specifies emotions as
a combination of two parameters, namely, valence and
arousal [40]. Valence stands for one’s judgment about a
situation as positive and negative and arousal spans from
calmness to excitement, expressing the degrees of one’s
excitation. Figure 1 shows the basic emotions plotted on
the 2D valence-arousal plane. In this work, six basic
emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, disgust) based on DEM were considered.
Stimulus material

Gathering good and meaningful data is essential in any
clinical application. In works related to emotion recognition using physiological signal, acquiring emotional data
that corresponds to specific emotional state is a challenging one, because of the subjective nature of the emotions and cognitive dependence of physiological signals.
This requires the emotional states to be elicited internally in the participants. Until now, most studies on emotion recognition in PD have used only facial stimuli,
prosodic stimuli, or both [41,42]. Also, a number of
emotion induction techniques using pictures, sounds,
music, or multimodal approach (combination of audio &
visual) have been used to elicit the target emotions
[43-47] in normal controls. Among all these stimuli modality researchers have identified that multimodal stimuli
induce emotions in the participants more naturally and
effectively than other modalities [45,46,48,49]. In this
work, we utilized a multimodal approach to evoke specific targeted emotional state.
The emotional stimuli were taken from different
sources such as the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) database [50], International Affective Digitized Sounds (IADS) [51] database and video clips (e.g.,
funny animals, wonder activities by humans, etc.) collected from various resources on the internet (e.g.,

YouTube, Facebook and others) [52]. In the work by
Brown et al. (2011), the stimuli used to elicit the emotion
internally in the participant included both video clips, and
combination of pictures & sounds selected from the IAPS
and IADS database. The results of the experiment showed
that there is no difference when performing the experiment with different sources of stimuli (but same characteristics) to induce emotion internally in the participants
[53]. The elicitation of emotions such as sadness, fear, and
disgust was mainly attained by using affective pictures
from IAPS and sounds from IADS databases. Various psychological and psychophysiological experiments have experienced that these stimuli set has great potential in the
investigation of sadness, fear, and disgust emotion [43,53].
Moreover, Mikels et al. [54] & Redondo et al. [55] provided a more complete characterization of the categorical
structure of the IAPS and IADS stimulus set, with the objective of identifying images and sounds that elicit one
discrete emotion more than other emotions. From this,
the IAPS pictures1 (disgust: valence mean (SD) = 2.43
(1.51), arousal mean (SD) = 5.90 (2.25); fear: valence mean
(SD) = 3.80 (1.89), arousal mean (SD) = 5.85 (2.12); sadness:
valence mean (SD) = 2.74 (1.57), arousal mean (SD) =5.00
(2.08)) and IADS sound2 (disgust: valence mean (SD) =
4.00 (1.72), arousal mean (SD) = 5.82 (1.93); fear: valence
mean (SD) = 4.00 (1.72), arousal mean (SD) = 5.82 (1.93);
sadness: valence mean (SD) = 3.28 (1.65), arousal mean
(SD) = 6.61 (1.89)) were selected and combined together according to their arousal and valence values provided in the
databases. For example, a negative/high aroused sound is
matched with a negative/high aroused image. Furthermore,

the emotions happiness, surprise, and anger were elicited
using video clips. One of the major tasks in inducing emotions using audio-visual clips is to identify video clips that
would elicit the target emotions better. For this, around 30
video clips per emotional state were collected from various
sources on the internet, and a pilot study was conducted.
Thirty volunteers in the mean age of 26.4 years (24 to
45 years) participated in the pilot study to rate the emotions
they experienced when watching the video clips. All of
them were psychology teachers or students of the UKM
medical center, Kuala Lumpur. Thirty audio-visual clips
(ten for each emotion) with the highest rating were chosen
for data collection.
Emotion elicitation protocol

An illustrated version of the emotion elicitation protocol
is shown in Figure 2. As shown, the protocol had two
sessions of three trails each. There was a break of 10–
15 minutes between the sessions. The participants were
allowed to relax during the break (since the continuous
assessment would have been too exhausting). The multimodal stimulus relating to all the six emotional states
(happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust)
was displayed in each trial in a random order. Each combination of picture and sound was presented for six seconds [56]. To maximize the participants’ emotional
reactivity, each clip block consisted of six combinations
of the same emotional category and lasted for 36second. In addition, each of the video clips varied from
36–45 seconds in duration, depending on the length of
the clip. Neutral images, which can calm down the

participant state, were displayed for 10-second at the
start of each trail. This would help the participant to get
back to the normal or neutral state from emotional excitation. Besides, a 15-second rating interval [57] was provided between the clips in which participants answered
on a five point self-assessment scale and also helps to
avoid any feedback from the previous emotional stimuli.
Each session took about approximately 30 minutes.
Procedure

The purpose of the study was clearly explained to the
participants before starting the experiment. The participants were further requested to relax, minimize their
body movement (to reduce the appearance of relevant artifacts in the EEG recordings), and concentrate on the
emotional stimuli. Then, self-guided emotion elicitation
protocol was displayed on the screen. The experiment set
up was shown in Figure 3. At the end of each clip, participants filled a self-assessment questionnaire to state the
status and strength of the emotions they felt during the
experiment. They were asked to report the strength using
a five-point scale according to the degree (1 = very low,
2 = low, 3 = medium, 4 = high, and 5 = very high). The participants were also allowed to indicate multiple emotions

during the experiment. A picture of the self-assessment
questionnaire is as shown in Table 2.
EEG recording and data analysis

EEG recordings were conducted using the Emotive EPOC
14-channel EEG wireless recording headset (Emotive Systems, Inc., San Francisco, CA). The electrode scheme was
arranged according to the international 10–20 system and
included active electrodes at AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1,
O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, and AF4 positions, referenced to
the common mode sense (CMS-left mastoid)/driven right
leg (DRL-right mastoid) ground as shown in Figure 4. The
acquired data were digitized using the embedded 16-bit
ADC with 128 Hz sampling frequency per channel and
sent to the computer through wireless technology. It utilizes a proprietary USB dongle to communicate using the
2.4 GHz band. Prior to use, all felt pads on top of the sensors have to be moistened with a saline solution. In
addition, the Emotiv Software Development Kit (SDK)
provides packet count functionality to ensure no data is
lost. The real time sensor contact quality was visually
monitored to ensure quality of measurements.
EEG analysis was performed offline in the MATLAB
(version7.12.0.635, R2011a) environment. The raw EEG

data was split as per the emotional states. After that, the
EEG signals were subjected to filtering. In particular, IIR
Butterworth bandpass (6th order filter) was used. The
focus was placed upon the four EEG frequency bands:
delta (1 – 4 Hz), theta (4 – 8 Hz), alpha (8 – 13 Hz),
and beta (13 – 30 Hz) [47,58]. A study published by Kim
[56], proposed that the use of different epoch size that
depends on modality, e.g., 2–6 seconds for speech, and
3–15 seconds for biosignals. In this study, the EEG signals were segmented into six seconds corresponding to
the duration of each multimodal stimuli projection.
Then, a separate threshold method was used to remove
eye blinking artifacts, in which epochs that were found
to have amplitudes exceeding ± 80 μV were excluded
from the study [59]. Finally, eighty four artifact-free
epochs from middle data segment of each emotional

state across delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency band
were selected for further analysis.
The frequency domain analysis was performed using
the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm (with the
resolution of 0.125 Hz) to calculate absolute (μV2/Hz)
power density, relative (%) power density and mean frequency (Hz) within each of the sub-bands. The absolute
power of a band is the integral of all of the power values
within its frequency range. Relative power (RP) indices
for each band were derived by expressing absolute power
in each frequency band as a percent of the absolute power
(AP) summed over the four frequency bands. Mean frequency was calculated using a formula published by [60].
Mean (total) frequency (Hz) was also derived from the
entire analyzed spectrum (1 – 30 Hz). Measures of interhemispheric (absolute) power asymmetry for each band
were also computed for seven homologous sites (AF3AF4, F7-F8, F3-F4, FC5-FC6, T7-T8, P7-P8, O1-O2) and
an additional set of ten electrode site pairs (AF3-F3, AF4F4, F3-O1, F4-O2, FC5-P7, FC6-P8, P7-O1, P8-O2, T7O1, T8-O2) were used to derive measures of intrahemispheric power asymmetry for each band as based on
the ‘neurometrics’ formulas described by John et al. and
Prichep and John [61,62]. Accordingly, right (R) hemisphere vs. left (L) hemisphere asymmetry indices (R-L)
were calculated with the formula [(R-L)/(R + L)]. For
intra-hemispheric symmetry, anterior (A) (frontal) vs.
posterior (P) (back) (A-P) value ratios for each electrode
pair were derived with the formula [(A-P)/(A + P)]. Absolut power and asymmetry EEG variables were log transformed (log(χ)) and, relative power variables were
transformed by log[χ ÷ (1 ‐ χ)] in order to normalize the
distribution of the data [63-65]. As with John et al. [66],
the EEG frequency (Hz) indices were found to be normally
distributed and thus did not require transformation.
Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS
version 20.0 software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
The Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to evaluate
whether continuous variables exhibited a normal distribution. Parametric analysis was applied to normal data,
whereas nonparametric analysis was applied to nonnormal data. A three-way repeated measures (mixed design) analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using
the factors: Group (PD, normal controls), Emotional
states (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, disgust and surprise) and Electrode sites for absolute power, relative
power and frequency measures for each frequency band.
Similarly, separate ANOVAs were conducted on inter
and intra-hemispheric asymmetry measures. The ANOVAs treated Emotional states and Electrode sites as a
within subjects factor and Group as between subjects factor. When a main effect of or interactions with Emotional

states were found as significantly different between two
groups, another ANOVA (two-way) was performed, using
only the Emotional states factor values from the selected
frequency band. In these analyses Group was the between
subjects factor and Electrode sites the repeated factor. Violations of sphericity were adjusted by the Greenhouse- Geiser
epsilon correction [67]. When a significant Group x Electrode sites interaction was detected by ANOVA, in order to
determine significance of difference for each of the electrodes, a separate two tailed student’s t-test was performed.
In addition, the data from the behavioral study (subjective ratings as well emotion recognition rates) were
analyzed separately by repeated ANOVA measures, with
group as between-subject factor and emotion as withinsubject factor. The results were considered as significant
at the level of p < 0.05. For all analyses, the uncorrected
degrees of freedom and the corrected p-values are reported. Due to space reasons, only significant effects
between-group, Emotional state factors and follow up
test results are reported here.

Results
Behavioral measures

Mean subjective ratings are given in Table 3. As shown,
overall the ratings were higher for happiness, and lower
for disgust; main effect of emotion [F(5, 240) = 7.88, p <
0.0001]. No significant difference between groups and
no Group x Emotion interaction were observed (p > 0.9).
In the emotion recognition task (shown in Figure 5),
performance of PD patients did not differ significantly
from NC. Overall, happiness emotions were recognized
best (% correct M = 93.42; SD = 9.00), whereas disgust
emotions were recognized worst (% correct M = 69.58;
SD = 3.20), [F(5, 240) = 2.99, p = 0.023].

(y-axis) for seven site pairs (x-axis) in PD patients and normal controls during emotional stimuli. More negative numbers indicate less delta power.
Lower numbers (i.e., more negative) are associated with increased activation [45]. The significant site pair (p < 0.05) differences between the
groups were marked as *.

Group absolute power differences were limited to theta
[F(1, 166) = 29.16, p = 0.0001], alpha [F(1, 166) = 20.42,
p = 0.0001], and beta [F(1, 166) = 8.89, p = 0.003] activity.
To explain Group x Emotion interaction, a post-hoc twoway ANOVA was performed for each emotion with
Group and Electrode pair. This disclosed a significant difference between PD patients and NC group in delta,
theta, alpha, and beta frequency band during emotion information processing, with PD patients having less absolute power across all the emotional state. Table 4 shows
the summary of absolute power p-values obtained from
two-way ANOVA. Follow up t-tests showed that PD patients had less absolute power values than in controls at
all the scalp sites during emotional stimuli of different
categories. In general, the absolute power distributions
with theta, alpha, and beta were maximum at anterior
sites and delta maximum at posterior sites, bilaterally
during the emotional stimuli.

Relative power measures with ANOVAs found that
significant Emotional state effects were shown for delta
[F(2, 332) = 7.053, p = 0.001], theta [F(2, 332) = 3.085,
p = 0.047], alpha [F(2, 332] = 6.332; p = 0.002), and beta
[F(2, 332) = 5.195, p = 0.006]. Although significant
Group differences were observed with delta [F(1,166) =

alpha [F(1, 166) = 46.520, p = 0.001] and beta [F(1, 166) =
15.156, p = 0.000] activity. Two-way ANOVA on Emotional state values separately confirmed significant influence of Group x Electrode sites interaction in all the
bands, which indicated that PD patients show reduced
brain electrical activity during the processing of different emotional categories than NC. Table 4 shows

The ANOVA with three way repeated measures interaction revealed significant Emotional state effects for
inter-hemispheric delta [F(2, 332) = 3.225, p = 0.041],
theta [F(2, 332) = 3.225, p = 0.014], alpha [F(2, 332) =

activity. Two-way ANOVA separately showed a significant Group x Electrode sites interaction with interhemispheric delta, theta, alpha, and beta band. This
showed that all the Emotional states could be differentiated significantly between the two groups, with less band
power (i.e., reduced brain activity) in the PD group when
compared to the normal control group. Table 5 shows
the summary of inter-hemispheric significant difference
p-values of each emotional categories with respect to

frequency bands. Figures 6, 7, 8 and 9 summarize the
mean ± Standard error (S.E) significance of differences
between PD patients and NC group in delta, theta,
alpha, and beta band for each of the Electrode sites, as
revealed by an independent t-tests. Significant Group
inter-hemispheric differences were limited to theta [F(1,
166) = 20.802, p = 0.0001], alpha [F(1, 166) = 46.612, p =
0.0001], and beta [F(1,166) = 9.152, p = 0.003). In general, inter-hemispheric theta, alpha and beta ratio values
were smaller at anterior regions across the significant
electrode pairs. Whereas both groups evidenced positive
asymmetry ratio values during the emotional stimuli indicating greater right than left hemisphere power, the
positive values were generally larger in the normal controls than in the PD patients.
A three way repeated ANOVA measures found significant Emotional states were shown for intra-hemispheric

beta [F(5,332) = 3.225, p = 0.041]. Two ways ANOVA on
Emotional state values separately confirmed significant
influence of Group x Electrode sites interaction with
intra-hemispheric delta, theta, alpha, and beta, with decreased band power (i.e., less emotional activity) in PD
patients than normal controls. Table 5 shows the summary of intra-hemispheric significant difference p-values
of each emotional category with respect to frequency
bands. Figures 10, 11, 12 and 13 summarize the mean
(± S.E.) significance of differences between PD patients
and NC group in delta, theta, alpha, and beta band for
each of the Electrode sites, as revealed by independent
t-test. In general, intra-hemispheric ratio values were
smallest with F4-O2 and P7-O1 and largest with AF4-F4,
and F3-O1 site pairings with respect to normal controls.
Although significant Group intra-hemispheric differences
were limited to alpha [F(1,166) = 6.613, p = 0.011], with

normal controls exhibiting greater ratio values (indicating
relatively greater alpha at anterior vs. posterior sites of
each pair) than patients during emotion processing.
Follow-up tests found the two groups to differ with respect to significant site pairs in both right and left hemisphere (i.e., bilaterally). For the significant site pairs, both
groups exhibited both negative/positive ratio values, indicating evenly distributed power across anterior and posterior electrodes of these site pairs, but values were less
in the patients, than in the normal controls during emotional stimuli.

collapsed across Emotional states and Electrode sites are
shown in Figure 14. In general, delta frequency values were
higher at frontal-central sites, and theta frequency values
were smaller at temporal and occipital sites. Alpha and
beta frequencies values were higher at posterior sites, and
mean total frequency value was higher at anterior sites. Although no significant group differences were observed for
mean delta, theta, alpha and beta frequency, significant
Group [F(1, 166) = 4.522, p = 0.034] effects were found for
mean total frequency. Total frequency was generally higher
in patients, reaching significance (p < 0.05) at six anterior
(AF3, F7, F3, F4, F8, and AF4) of the fourteen targeted
electrode sites during emotion information processing.
Discriminant classification

With respect to discriminant analysis, we only used the
indices (by three way repeated ANOVA measures) that

differentiated PD patients and normal control groups
during emotion information processing. To further reduce the number of predictors, values within significant
band index were averaged across the significant sites/
site pairs which showed patients and controls to be different, thus resulting in one value per band for each
index. The statistical procedure used was multiple stepwise discriminant analysis. Table 6 displays the results
of the initial discriminant and the independent replication (cross-validation) classification accuracy from the
separation of PD patients from NC group based on EEG
variables collapsed across all the emotional categories.
The overall classification was 95.0% in both classification attempts. Theta, alpha, and beta absolute power;
delta, theta, alpha, and beta relative power; theta, alpha,
and beta inter-hemispheric power asymmetry; and alpha
intra-hemispheric power asymmetry contributed as features to the classification. The independent replication

demonstrates the high replicabilty and stability of this
discriminant function.

Discussion
The present study is to our knowledge the first to examine a relatively wide range of spectrally and statistically
derived EEG features in relation to emotion information
processing in PD patients. Significant patient vs. control
group differences were seen with a number of features
during emotion information processing. In line with previous findings on behavioral measures [5,16,17,21], the
present study also found PD patients to report no impairment in emotion recognition accuracy, and subjective ratings of emotional stimuli. It is noteworthy that
these findings are most likely not due to low statistical
power since PD patients were descriptively even better
in recognizing emotion disgust and fear compared to
normal controls. Moreover, Cohen et al. [68] found that

PD patients under dopamine replacement therapy (DRT)
were not impaired in emotion recognition, but were
more sensitive to cognitive load, which seems to be especially true for non-demented and non-depressive participants as in our study. On the other hand, absolute
and relative power revealed that PD patients showed
lower power values than normal controls during the
processing of happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise,
and disgust emotions. Significant group differences between PD patients and normal controls were limited to
theta, alpha and beta frequency bands. These findings
indicate the neuropathological evidence that PD could
be associated with the slowing of oscillatory brain activity [69,70]. This slowing of brain activity exhibits a significant correlation with progression of Hoehn and Yahr
stage in PD [71]. Although our PD samples were tested
on dopaminergic medication, they still revealed signs of
dopamine deficiency as indicated by a mean value of

17.05 in the motor part of the UPDRS. In addition, some
of the medications are known to be associated with impulse control disorders in PD, as these aspects might
have implications for emotion processing in patient
population [72-74].
With respect to inter-hemispheric EEG, PD patients
tended to show positive interhemispheric theta, alpha,
and beta ratios, indicating relative right hemisphere
hypoactivation, but this was more evidenced in NCs and
was not limited to anterior sites as group differences
were seen at almost all homologous site pairs. This was
the result of power asymmetry ratio analysis, with patients exhibiting relatively less right frontal activation.
The present inter-hemispheric results support the previously reported traditional theories of emotional processing suggesting right hemisphere specialization for the
perception and recognition of social cues [75]. More recently, lateralization of emotion recognition in PD has

been debated. For example, Clark et al. reported no
asymmetry effects on explicit emotion categorization [8].
Ariatti et al. and Yip et al. reported problems in categorizing disgust prosody in patients with predominantly
right-sided [23,24]. While Ventura et al. reported that
predominantly left sided patient’s exhibit recognition of
sadness emotion [25]. Intra-hemispheric EEG showed
significant alpha band group differences, with evenly distributed power across anterior and posterior electrodes,
with patients exhibited reduced intra-hemispheric values
at all of the significant site pairs. Anteriorization was
also evident for mean total spectrum frequency, with
mean frequency being higher in patients at bilateral prefrontal, frontal and central sites. The utility of EEG as a
clinical tool in the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders is
progressing [John, 1989], its routine use in clinical practice remains in doubt until appropriate investigations are
carried out on the reliability, sensitivity, and specificity

of these tests [Nuwer 1988]. However, the current discriminant analysis, carried out retrospectively in a nonblinded fashion, did reveal a marked separation of PD
patients and controls, yielding an overall accuracy of
95.0%, correctly classifying 27/30 normal controls (90.0%
specificity) and 20/20 PD patients (100% sensitivity) in
the separation of PD patients and normal controls during emotion information processing. This discriminant
analysis utilized power measures and asymmetry indices
as features.
Furthermore, the amygdala’s involvement in emotional
processing is now well documented in the literature
[76,77]. Interestingly, neuropathological research findings support the theory of amygdala impairment in PD.
For example, Tessitore et al. investigated the activation
of the amygdala in PD patients during emotion processing using fMRI, and found that PD patients exhibited
weaker amygdala activation in response to emotional

stimuli than NC [78]. Similarly, absence of amygdala response in PD patients was also found by Yoshimura
et al. [79]. Additionally, Cancelliere and Kertz (1990) reported that patients with cortical lesions who had additional damage to the basal ganglia showed the most
evident deficits in emotion information processing [80].
There is also a large body of evidence pointing to the involvement of dopamine in emotional process [81]. For
example, the association between dopaminergic activity
and emotion processing has been demonstrated in
healthy male volunteers that received dopamine D2antagonist, which caused an impaired recognition of
angry faces [82]. Sprengelmeyer et al. investigated the effect of dopamine medication and observed impaired
emotion information processing [10]. This deficit was
more severe in non-medicated patients than in medicated patients with PD. Using PET, it has been shown
that reduced dopamine transporter (DAT) availability

Figure 14 Mean frequencies during emotion processing. Group mean (± S.E.) non-log transformed frequency (in Hz) values, collapsed across
all sites during emotional stimuli for delta, theta, alpha, beta and total spectrum bands in PD patients and normal controls

was related to decrease in activation of emotional gesture recognition [83]. Similarly, an fMRI study revealed
that the activity of several limbic regions (amygdala,
hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex) during the perception of unpleasant images was reduced in normal
controls that had been given a dopaminergic antagonist
[84]. These results have been confirmed by other fMRI
studies using dopamine manipulations [85].
To sum up, the current study revealed that PD showed
no impairments in the behavioral measures, but exhibited deficits in emotional information processing as
reflected in neurophysiological measures. This indicated
that distributed spectral power in different frequency
bands might provide meaningful information about
emotional processes in PD patients. Further controlled
studies with PD patients ON and OFF medication could
help to clarify the influence of the dopaminergic medication on emotion processing. In general, PD is a complex
neurodegenerative disease; with significant influences on
brain activity. Therefore, as a step forward, it is necessary to apply new emotion recognition analysis methods
to extract more typical features from EEG signals of PD
patients, and further make classification analysis based

on those characteristics indices, which may have potential use as biomarkers of PD and provide an objective
technique for the investigation of emotional state
changes in PD.
