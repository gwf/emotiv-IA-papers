Over the past few years, assistive technologies have achieved
important milestones in enhancing the quality of everyday
life, in terms of both autonomy and well-being, of individuals
in need of assistance and care. The convergence process
behind ICT in the past decades, mainly from the point
of view of technology, but also in terms of management
and regulation has led to the widespread availability of
digital tools and rich data sources as building blocks for
effective solutions towards assistive technologies. Today the
promise of technologies that allow individuals to benefit from
portable and discrete aids delivered through mobile devices
seems more relevant than ever before. Ranging from assistive home automation (domotics) solutions to applications
that repurpose smartphones into electronic assistive devices,
breakthrough technologies are allowing users with physical
and/or mental disabilities to accomplish everyday tasks, as
well as to learn and develop social skills more easily.
The goal of this special issue was to create a multidisciplinary forum of discussion on recent advances within the
field of mobile technology to support individuals of all ages
in need of assistance and care. The issue is comprised of five
papers, each focusing on some aspect of rehabilitation, or on
ways of mitigating the effects of disabilities through a unique
combination of a variety of sensory and display technologies.
The technologies of BCI, virtual reality, and auditory displays
are especially well represented in the special issue.
The paper by A. Athanasiou et al. (entitled “Wireless
Brain-Robot Interface: User Perception and Performance
Assessment of Spinal Cord Injury Patients”) presents a pair of
8-DoF anthropomorphic robotic arms that can be controlled
through kinesthetic motor imagery using the commercially

available Emotiv EPOC BCI device. Through an extensive
set of user experiments, the authors provide a detailed
assessment of how parameters such as age, independence,
psychometric evaluation results, and neurological condition
(i.e., among both spinal cord injury patients and healthy
individuals) influences users’ ability to control the system
and their perception of the system. Based on the results,
the authors conclude that BCI systems enabling users to
effectively control multiple degrees of freedom in real-time
may well be within short-term reach.
The paper by R. B. Lupu et al. (entitled “BCI and FES
Based Therapy for Stroke Rehabilitation Using VR Facilities”)
also centers around BCI technology but combines it with
virtual reality with a view towards supporting the rehabilitation of stroke patients. The paper introduces a system
called TRAVEE, which makes combined use of an array of
stimulation devices (e.g., functional electrical stimulation)
to help the execution of the rehabilitation tasks, as well as
monitoring devices (via BCI and electrooculography) and
visual feedback (through virtual therapist) to provide users
with real-time guidance. Based on a set of evaluations, the
authors confirm that this closed-loop approach of connecting
action, stimulation, and real-time feedback can go a long way
in supporting the rehabilitation process, while at the same
time alleviating the need for the continuous availability of
trained therapists.
The paper by J. Gomez et al. (entitled “Using Smartphones to Assist People with Down Syndrome in Their
Labour Training and Integration: A Case Study”) presents
a smartphone application called AssisT-Task, which was
developed by the authors to help individuals with cognitive

2
impairments to establish effective learning methods. The
application is structured such that caregivers can define
tasks that consist of sequences of subtasks and describe
each subtask using text and visual figures which can then
be retrieved through context-specific QR codes. A detailed
analysis provided in the paper highlights the kinds of tasks
and types of disabilities with respect to which the application
provides the most benefits, and the authors conclude that,
based on the evidence, the application may be most suitable
to people with Down syndrome who are being trained to get a
job.
The paper by by C. Saitis et al. (entitled “Cognitive Load
Assessment from EEG and Peripheral Biosignals for the
Design of Visually Impaired Mobility Aids”) aims to develop
an approach that is capable of real-time automated cognitive
load analysis for visually impaired people. To that end, the
paper investigates the ways in which different indoor and
outdoor scenarios can be linked to certain characteristics of
EEG sensor data (in particular, a slightly modified version of
the ERD/ERS index, which is a well-established measure of
cognitive load) in test subjects with different degrees of visual
impairment. At the same time, a random forest based model
is proposed that uses the measurements of electrodermal
activity and blood volume pulse to predict discrete categories
based on the ERD/ERS indices. The success of the model
suggests that it may be possible to accurately gauge cognitive
load using widely available, unencumbered sensors, while
the scenario-dependent investigation in the first part of the
paper highlights the fact that environmental and subjectspecific factors may serve as useful a priori information in
the development of robust solutions for electronic travel aids
(ETAs).
Finally, the paper by S. Spagnol et al. (entitled “Current
Use and Future Perspectives of Spatial Audio Technologies
in Electronic Travel Aids”) focuses on a wide range of
aspects relevant to the implementation of spatialized audio
feedback in ETAs for the visually impaired. The paper provides a detailed overview on the acoustic and environmental
parameters which influence the spatial perception of auditory
stimuli, as well as the software and hardware aspects of spatial
sound production, and the ways in which those approaches
are used in currently available ETAs. In terms of software,
special focus is given to the various ways in which headrelated transfer functions (HRTFs) can be described—that
is, through generic models, personalized models, structurally
motivated models, and analytical or numerical means. In
terms of hardware, headsets that present sound without
occluding the ears (allowing visually impaired users who rely
on input from the physical environment to perceive it at the
same time), such as bone conduction headsets and active
transparent headsets, are highlighted as being most relevant
to ETAs.
