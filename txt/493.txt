Stress experiences in neighborhood
and social environments (SENSE): a pilot study
to integrate the quantified self with citizen
science to improve the built environment
and health

Abstract
Background: Identifying elements of one’s environment—observable and unobservable—that contribute to chronic
stress including the perception of comfort and discomfort associated with different settings, presents many methodological and analytical challenges. However, it also presents an opportunity to engage the public in collecting and analyzing their own geospatial and biometric data to increase community member understanding of their local environments
and activate potential environmental improvements. In this first-generation project, we developed a methodology to
integrate geospatial technology with biometric sensing within a previously developed, evidence-based “citizen science”
protocol, called “Our Voice.” Participants used a smartphone/tablet-based application, called the Discovery Tool (DT), to
collect photos and audio narratives about elements of the built environment that contributed to or detracted from their
well-being. A wrist-worn sensor (Empatica E4) was used to collect time-stamped data, including 3-axis accelerometry,
skin temperature, blood volume pressure, heart rate, heartbeat inter-beat interval, and electrodermal activity (EDA).
Open-source R packages were employed to automatically organize, clean, geocode, and visualize the biometric data.
Results: In total, 14 adults (8 women, 6 men) were successfully recruited to participate in the investigation. Participants recorded 174 images and 124 audio files with the DT. Among captured images with a participant-determined
positive or negative rating (n = 131), over half were positive (58.8%, n = 77). Within-participant positive/negative
rating ratios were similar, with most participants rating 53.0% of their images as positive (SD 21.4%). Significant spatial
clusters of positive and negative photos were identified using the Getis-Ord Gi* local statistic, and significant associations between participant EDA and distance to DT photos, and street and land use characteristics were also observed
with linear mixed models. Interactive data maps allowed participants to (1) reflect on data collected during the neighborhood walk, (2) see how EDA levels changed over the course of the walk in relation to objective neighborhood
features (using basemap and DT app photos), and (3) compare their data to other participants along the same route.
Conclusions: Participants identified a variety of social and environmental features that contributed to or detracted
from their well-being. This initial investigation sets the stage for further research combining qualitative and quantitative data capture and interpretation to identify objective and perceived elements of the built environment influence
our embodied experience in different settings. It provides a systematic process for simultaneously collecting multiple

Background
Living and working in chronically stressful environments
are thought to contribute to a wide range of adverse
health outcomes. While the body’s stress response systems (e.g., “fight-or-flight”) may be helpful in adapting to
acute environmental stimuli, major life events, or trauma,
the continual triggering of these mechanisms may diminish an individual’s biological capacity to respond to
stressors [1]. With the impairment of this biological system, chronic stress can increase an individual’s risk of
experiencing adverse health outcomes, including chronic
diseases such as obesity and type II diabetes [1–3].
Emerging research is also beginning to help us conceptualize and document the causal pathways, including stress,
related to built environments that may explain the welldocumented burden of chronic disease in disadvantaged
communities [4–6].
Many studies exploring connections between stress
and health have used levels of blood or salivary cortisol,
a steroid hormone produced as part of the body’s stress
response. Most cortisol research attempts to describe
cumulative stress effects, though additional attention to
the different types of stressors—events, structural circumstances, or daily routines—is needed to understand
possible pathways to poor health [7]. For example, prior
studies often have found limited or conflicting evidence
about the nature of the relationship between cortisol and
socioeconomic status [7]. McEwen and colleagues proposed a broad framework for measuring chronic stress
that included a set of ten biometric markers, including cortisol, a steroid hormone produced as part of the
body’s stress response. Called “allostatic load” (AL), the
measure was intended as a proxy measure for overall
“wear and tear” on the body’s stress response systems
[1]. Other researchers have found relationships between
AL and adverse mental and behavioral health outcomes,
including cognition [2, 8].
The concept of allostatic load has been applied to
chronic environmental stressors, especially those related
to workplace or neighborhood environments [8, 9].
Theall et al. [8] found that a significant amount of AL
variance among adolescents in the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey was attributable to
neighborhood-level factors, such as poverty, crime, and
density of alcohol retailers, even after controlling for
household-level characteristics. While biomarkers such

as cortisol or allostatic load allow for a consideration of
the cumulative effects of stress, they are not as well suited
to understanding the relative influence of different stressors, or how individual and environmental characteristics
intersect to yield different stress outcomes.
In response to this challenge, Roe and colleagues
have spearheaded a new generation of interdisciplinary research that measures direct biological responses
to different types of built environments. Using a headworn device, the Emotiv EPOC, Roe et al. [10] explored
changes in brain activity (measured via electroencephalogram, or EEG) as laboratory participants were exposed
to images of urban and natural landscape scenes. These
findings informed later EEG studies with free-moving
participants walking in different types of environments.
For instance, Aspinall et al. [11] found EEG changes as
participants moved into and out of urban green spaces
and other environments.
Complicating the identification of environmental contributors to chronic stress is the role of individual perception [12]. For instance, environmental health researchers
have found that individuals living in objectively noisy
neighborhoods do not, in general, exhibit the same elevated stress responses to noise as those that do not. That
is, individuals may become habituated to or learn to alter
their perceptions of such chronically stressful environments [13], although resident selection factors may also
be at work, at least to some extent (e.g., individuals who
are particularly sensitive to high noise levels may move
out of or avoid such neighborhoods) [14–19]. Based
on such research, studies aimed at investigating physiological responses to stress in differing environments
are challenged to integrate perception-based measures
within their built environment assessments. For example,
Aspinall et al. [11] also asked participants to rate scenes
across several subjective criteria (e.g., pleasure/displeasure, calm/excitement), adding a dimension of personal
preference and underlying attitudes toward certain types
of built environments.
One relatively untested arena that may help us understand both individual characteristics and perceptions
that matter for chronic stress is the quantified self. This
sensor-oriented movement encompasses a range of selfmonitoring technologies, especially those that can be
integrated into smartphones as mobile applications [20].
Users typically collect and review biometric (e.g., weight,

Chrisinger and King ﻿Int J Health Geogr (2018) 17:17

heart rate) and/or behavioral (e.g., diet, sleep, exercise)
data out of curiosity or an interest in self-improvement
[20–22]. While quantified self applications may focus on
individual or group-level changes in behavior through
biofeedback or goal-setting, there is great potential to
develop relevant insights on population-level outcomes
given sufficiently large datasets [23, 24]. For instance, a
recent smartphone-derived “big data” study found citylevel correlations between objective walkability metrics
and device-based walking outcomes measured from over
700,000 smartphone users across 111 countries [24].
Aside from proprietary wearable datasets, some university-sponsored projects aim to crowd-source placebased biometric data. One example is the Personal
Activity Location Monitoring System (PALMS), which
provides validated tools and methodologies for collecting
geo-located biometric data to track behavior across space
and time, especially individual and group-level dynamics of physical activity [25–27]. Another suite of projects
employ “People as Sensors” methodologies that crowdsource a variety of objective and perceived data, including biometrics, in order to deliver relevant feedback to
urban designers and planners [28–30]. For example, Zeile
and colleagues used a biosensor-oriented approach to
track how and why stress responses changed over space
and time among a cohort of bicyclists in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. Importantly, they found participants’
mapped stress data corresponded to individual experiences, as measured with video recordings [30].
Our pilot study builds upon earlier biometric built
environment assessments by integrating dimensions of
the quantified self movement. First, we utilized a biometric measure of stress involving electrodermal activity
(EDA), which has been shown to be an effective means of
differentiating between different kinds of stress environments and situations (e.g., driving in traffic vs. highway
driving), and can be collected with relatively low impact
on participant experience compared to head- or chestworn devices [31]. Second, we embedded our biometric data collection within an existing successful “citizen
science”-based community activation model, called “Our
Voice”, which includes a mobile application, referred to
as the “Discovery Tool,” that allows community members
to collect objective and perceived neighborhood data
[32, 33], providing a systematic and technology-assisted
enhancement to existing community-based qualitative
research methods, such as Photovoice [34, 35]. By creating a simple and reliable method of collecting geolocated
stress data while participants use the Discovery Tool in
the field, we aim to amplify the known strengths of this
type of citizen science model. Finally, we introduce opensource methods for visualizing and sharing perceived
and objective participant data with participants for their

Page 3 of 13

inspection and interpretation, with some possible applications for future testing with additional spatial data.
The primary goals of this pilot study were to: (1) test
the feasibility of including biometric data collection via
wrist-worn sensors as part of the objective and perceived
built environment data collection capabilities of the Discovery Tool mobile app being employed to obtain resident-collected information on local built environments;
(2) test the acceptability of different biometric data visualization styles; and (3) explore possible options for testing relationships between documented elements of the
built environment and biometric changes/outcomes.

Methods
Participant recruitment

To be eligible for the study, prospective participants had
to be healthy adult volunteers living in or around San
Francisco, California, and able to complete a relatively
easy 20- to 25-min walk. Participants were recruited as
a convenience sample in San Francisco through the networks of our San Francisco Bay Area community partner, an urban planning and design nonprofit called Place
Lab, and through members of the research team. Walk
appointments were scheduled for one of two days in July
and September 2017.
Biometric sensor

A wrist-worn biometric sensor, the Empatica E4, was
selected for this study because it provides a commercially
available, easy-to-use means of continuously collecting
time-stamped biometric data, including stress response
and other possible measures that could be used in subsequent feature identification algorithms. Data collected
by the E4 include 3-axis accelerometry (which measures
gravitational force on three spatial dimensions, allowing for a three-dimensional understanding of participant
movement), skin temperature, blood volume pressure,
heart rate, heartbeat inter-beat interval, and electrodermal activity (EDA). Once participants signed the study
consent form, which was approved by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board, they were asked to
put on and activate the sensor, which they wore during
a 10-min pre-walk period. The purpose of this approximately 10-min pre-walk data collection was two-fold: (1)
to allow for the sensor to make appropriate contact with
the skin surface, and (2) to collect baseline electrodermal
activity data for subsequent data analysis.
Mobile built environment audit tool application

This investigation was intended to determine the initial
feasibility and utility of adding biometric sensor data to
the built environment data collected with the DT app,
which is typically embedded within a broader citizen

science community engagement research method called
Our Voice. This method has been used successfully to
study built and social environments in a variety of settings [32], and features the simple DT mobile application
to capture photos, audio narratives, and participantassigned valences for the specific built environment
elements being captured (“Is this [built environment element] good or bad for the community?”). The DT app
also captures the geocoordinates of the user’s walking
route and a short demographic survey upon completion
of a walk. It additionally collects latitude and longitude
coordinates every second while participants use it, and all
photos taken with the app has geo-coordinates embedded
in their metadata. A web portal for viewing DT participant data allows the research team to download summary data for each walk, including the walk route and
locations of all photos and audio recordings. The full Our
Voice process (not included in this pilot study) involves
collection of geo-tagged photos and audio narratives with
the DT mobile app, followed by facilitated community
meetings to identify shared themes and build community
consensus, in partnership with identified stakeholders,
around how to address environmental issues negatively
impacting resident health and well-being and [32, 33,
36–39].
Depending on their preference, participants downloaded the DT from the Apple App Store or Google Play
Store [40, 41], or used electronic tablets (Samsung Galaxy Tab E Lite 7”) that were made available to them and
already contained the required DT app [42]. Participants
were verbally instructed on how to use the DT app, and
prompted to take photos and describe aspects of this
neighborhood environment that they felt influenced their
well-being or the functioning of these public spaces.
Neighborhood walks

Based on our community partner’s interest in existing
and future public space projects in a specific neighborhood of San Francisco, California, an approximately
20-min walking route (0.9 miles) was predetermined
to take participants through a variety of different environments, including a small public green space, back
alleys, and busy commercial streets. Participants were
instructed to document anything along the route that
they believed influenced their well-being or the functioning of these public spaces. A researcher accompanied
groups of up to four participants at a time to direct them
along the route and help troubleshoot any difficulties
with the app or wearable sensor. Participants were also
encouraged not to talk to one another during the neighborhood walks. Following the neighborhood walk, participants completed a short demographic survey embedded
within the DT app, and returned the biometric sensor

and tablet (if borrowed) to the investigators. Five groups
participated over two separate days in August and October 2017, and group sizes ranged from one to four participants, depending on participant availability.
Application stability issues related to the large quantity of photos and audio recordings taken by some participants caused the DT app images from several walks
(n = 6) to be lost, though for two walks where audio files
were recovered, the research team was able re-create the
image in Google Street View by using the approximate
location and subject being described in the audio file.
For one of the participants without photo/audio data, the
research team was also unable to recover biometric data.
Biometric data were successfully downloaded and processed for the remaining participants (n = 13).
Data processing

Each participant’s EDA data were normalized by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range
from their baseline data values, consistent with prior
research using EDA data from the Empatica E4 biosensor
[31]. To assist with comparisons between participants,
each participant’s normalized EDA data were also centered (subtracting the mean) and scaled (dividing by the
standard deviation of the centered data). To help identify
sudden changes, or “peaks,” in EDA, a proprietary algorithm from the company was applied to help remove
erroneous readings, or “noise,” possibly caused by sudden
motions or other non-EDA-related issues with the sensor.
Skin temperature, 3-axis accelerometry, and EDA data
files were provided as algorithm inputs; outputs included
time-stamped peaks in EDA with characteristics such as
peak amplitude and wavelengths.
Simple text processing was performed on participant
audio narrative transcriptions using functions from the
tm (“text mining”) package in R. To prepare the text for
review, all letters were shifted to lowercase, very common words were removed, and a word frequency table
was generated [43, 44]. This table was further grouped by
nouns and adjectives, and words with a frequency greater
than five were included in a visualization to compare the
most prevalent terms across all participants.
Data visualization

Visualizations of each individual participant’s walking
route while using the DT app were generated with leaflet, an open-source JavaScript visualization library, which
we deployed within the R software environment [45–47].
Markers indicating the location of photos/audio narratives taken were added to these maps, and two-dimensional binned kernel density estimates were calculated to
visualize clusters of positive and negative photos (using
the bkde2D function of the KernSmooth package) [48,

Chrisinger and King ﻿Int J Health Geogr (2018) 17:17

49]. The walking route was color-coded by participants’
relative EDA levels during their walk, with peaks illustrated as additional markers of sizes according to their
amplitude. These web-based visualizations were shared
with participants via email, and their feedback was solicited with an open-ended web-based survey. Interactive
data maps were generated for participant feedback, but
were not specifically analyzed as part of this study. These
maps allowed participants to (1) reflect on data collected
during the neighborhood walk; (2) see how EDA levels
changed over the course of the walk in relation to objective neighborhood features (e.g., basemap and DT app
photos); and 3) compare their data to other participants
along the same route. An example data map is shown in
Fig. 1, and an interactive example is provided as Additional file 1.
Spatial and statistical analyses

The database underlying the participant walk map visualizations described above was imported to a geographic
information system software, ArcMap 10.5.1 [50], where
a variety of spatial data (listed below) from the City of
San Francisco had been pre-assembled [51, 52]. Spatial
joins were performed to assign each walking route GPS
coordinate several fields from these local data, in addition to the biometric data used in the visualizations:
distance to the nearest positive- and negative-rated DT
photo, distance to the nearest street intersection (as possible points of interest in terms of high traffic/activity),
parcel characteristics (e.g., current land use, age of buildings), and street characteristics (e.g., name, one/two-way
traffic pattern, classification as a highway, major, secondary, or local street).
In addition to summary statistics of participants’ EDA
data by different spatial characteristics, two additional
analyses were performed. First, the significance of spatial clustering of positive and negative DT photos was
assessed with the Optimized Hot Spot Analysis tool,
which calculates the Getis-Ord Gi* local statistic (Gi*),
a standardized measure of clustering for specified areal
units (here, set as 5-m grid cells along the walk path)
[53–55]. For this pilot, the top quintile of Gi* statistics
were selected as the most highly clustered cells; this procedure was performed separately for positive and negative DT photos. A subsequent spatial join between these
highly clustered cells and the participant walk data created a binary variable for observations inside or outside
of a clustered cell.
Second, a linear mixed model was fit on geo-located
biometric data observations using R (via lmer in the lme4
package) to identify associations between the main outcome, participant EDA, with contextual walk measures
as fixed effects [56, 57]: location inside or outside of a

Page 5 of 13

highly-clustered cell, location within 10 m of a street
intersection, one/two-way traffic pattern and classification of street, land use of the nearest parcel, age of
building on the nearest parcel, and the observation’s
time during the walk. A random intercept was specified
to account for grouping of the study design: biometric
observations within individuals (14 participants) within
groups (5 walk groups). To illustrate possible within-subject variations, simple linear regression models were fit
for three participants for EDA outcomes and whether the
observation was taken in positive or negative DT cluster.

Results
In total, 14 adults (8 women and 6 men) who lived in the
San Francisco Bay Area were recruited to participate as
a convenience sample. Participants recorded 181 images
(mean 15.1, SD 8.4) and 146 audio files (mean 12.2, SD
8.6) with the DT app, and 5416 geo-located biometric
data observations were collected from 13 participants
(approximately 416 observations per participant). Figure 2 illustrates the spatial distribution of photographs
taken with the DT app by the positive/negative valence
assigned by participants for the built environment features being captured.
Among captured images that were tagged with a participant-coded valence (n = 131), just over half were positive
(n = 77). Within-participant positive/negative valence
ratios were similar, with most participants rating 53.0% of
their images as positive (SD 21.4%). The average distance
to a positive DT photo during a walk was 11.9 m, while
the average distance to a negative photo was 14.7 m. In
terms of the narratives participants used to explain their
photographs in the DT app, several words were repeated
frequently. The most common nouns used by participants in their audio narratives included “street” (n = 35),
“building” (n = 29), and “people” (n = 25), while “nice”
(n = 22), “safe” (n = 11), and “good” (n = 10) were the
most common adjectives. Figure 3 provides a visualization of all nouns and adjectives used by participants with
an overall frequency greater than five.
Based on the Getis-Ord Gi* local statistic (estimated
at a 95% confidence level), two significant clusters of
positive DT photos comprised approximately 4.3% of
the walk route (by distance), while negative photo clusters represented 2.7% of the route, also in two significant
clusters. Both of the significant positive clusters occurred
within the first half of the walk route, and both significant
negative clusters occurred within the second half, though
both negative and positive DT photos were taken on all
except one street during the course of the walk. Table 1
summarizes the frequency of walk observations by a variety of environmental characteristics, including presence

inside of a positive or negative cluster, and Fig. 4 displays
summary statistics for electrodermal activity across these
characteristics.
Based on the linear mixed model, statistically significant positive associations were found between participant EDA and positive photo clusters (B = 0.14, p < 0.001),
and significant negative associations were found between
participant EDA and negative photo clusters (B = − 0.17,
p < 0.001). This suggests that, on average, participants’
EDA was higher in areas where many participants documented more favorable features of the environment, and
lower in areas where they documented less favorable features. Other significant associations between EDA and
walk characteristics were also observed, including the
street type (significantly lower for highway, major, and
secondary streets compared to local streets, p < 0.001),
and land uses compared to parcels designated as “open
space” (significantly higher near mixed/residential
[p < 0.001] and residential [p = 0.033]; significantly lower
near office [p = 0.003] and vacant buildings [p < 0.001]).
The age of buildings also was associated with EDA, with

older buildings seeing higher observations, compared to
the most recent buildings. All models, 95% confidence
intervals, and coefficients are displayed in Table 2.
Exploratory linear regression models for three individual participants also showed significant relationships
for presence in a positive or negative DT photo cluster,
though they were of varying magnitudes and directions
(see Table 3). Additionally, these regressions indicated
that positive and negative clusters had far better explanatory value for some participants’ EDA than for others
(e.g., ­R2 = 0.076 for Participant A3, vs. ­R2 = 0.263 for Participant B3).

Discussion
In this first-generation pilot investigation, we successfully assembled diverse technologies to collect and visualize objective, perceived, and biometric data in an urban
neighborhood context. These data collection methods
provide researchers with a means of investigating both
group and individual-level responses to different environmental conditions.

In the case of the urban neighborhood walked by our
participants, common perceptions of the built environment were observed, both in terms of the repeated
terms captured in DT narratives and the significant
clustering of positive and negative DT photos. At the
group level, linear mixed model testing confirmed that
the average participant EDA levels observed inside a
positive cluster were significantly higher than those
observed elsewhere on the walk. Conversely, EDA
observations inside negative DT photo clusters were
significantly lower than those from outside them. Further exploration is needed to understand the dimensions of this relationship, though these preliminary
statistical associations suggest that participants’ ratings of the built environment were reflected in their
stress responses. Additionally, significant correlations
between objective measures of the built environment,
such as land use and street type, and EDA also highlight potentially influential relationships that could be
more carefully tested with additional participant walks.
These data also illustrated the value of multi-dimensional measurement at individual and group levels. While
at least some participants may have been motivated to

document similar built environment features, this did
not mean that their interpretations were identical. For
example, as shown in Fig. 5, two participants on the same
walk captured images of a particular intersection that
did not allow pedestrians to cross on all sides. For one
participant, this represented a barrier, while the other
rated it as a positive feature. While this was not a common occurrence, it is possible that future studies with
additional participants, better measures of participant
demographics (e.g., age, gender, length of residence in/
around the city, etc.) or a focus on a narrower geographic
area will find similar discrepancies between individual
assessments of the same feature. Furthermore, as Table 3
illustrated, the strength of the relationship between EDA
and participant-rated DT photos may not be consistent
across all participants. Ultimately, this example underscores the importance of combining both objective and
perceived built environment information in assessments.
Limitations

Another study limitation was the small number of residents included in this initial feasibility study to develop
a systematic process for collecting and analyzing diverse

types of data geo-located data. Though the participant
sample is small, these individuals produced a relatively
large database of qualitative data in terms of photo
(n = 181) and audio narratives (n = 146). Similar studies
using the Discovery Tool application have found even
small groups of participants (e.g., 8–10) are able to reach

thematic saturation when identifying positive and negative features of a particular built environment [32]. Additionally, the fine-grained biometric data collection adds
thousands of additional data points in which these photos
and audio narratives can be contextualized. The methods
we have described are easily scalable to accommodate

many more participants, should future researchers desire
to integrate them into crowd-sourcing initiatives, as in
other quantified self projects [27].
In terms of logistical challenges, we encountered issues
with mobile app stability during some walks because of
the amount of image/audio data being collected, which
resulted in the loss of photo and audio data for some
participants. Our research team was able to retrieve or
recreate some photos with Google Street View, and participant experiences informed subsequent developer
updates to the DT app (e.g., enabling reliable capture of
larger quantities of images and audio narratives) along
with an accompanying troubleshooting guide for new
users.
Several methodological questions were also raised during the course of the pilot, and should be considered in
future research. First, the potential effects of having participants walk in groups, as undertaken in this study, versus independently, are worth further consideration. It is

likely—and was observed by some participants—that
individuals felt more inclined to take photographs when
they observed others in their group doing so. One participant described this circumstance in an audio narrative about a small church building along the route: “I find
that when the person I’m on a walk with takes a photo of
something, I want to take a photo of the same thing. But
it’s true, this blue building is pretty excellent” (see Additional file 3).
Another methodological question relates to the use
of the Empatica E4 sensor. While we used a 10-min
pre-walk period to obtain a reasonable baseline measurement, it is possible that longer time periods or data
collected under different circumstances (e.g., walking vs. standing or sitting) may yield more complete
or interpretable measures for participants outside of
laboratory environments. Other researchers using
the Empatica sensor may find additional utility in the
multi-dimensional data it creates to identify “signals”
within the EDA data, versus “noise” possibly caused by
a participant’s motions, perspiration due to exertion, or
other factors. The availability of such resources as the
“EDA Explorer,” which integrates the sensor’s 3-axis
accelerometry, skin temperature, and EDA data to more
precisely estimate EDA changes, suggest that device
developers are considering the implications of collecting electrodermal data in ambulatory settings, perhaps
a sign of future guidance on this topic [58, 59].
The neighborhood walk route was also the subject
of methodological deliberations. While having participants walk the same route allowed for a more direct
comparison between participants’ DT app and biometric data, it also imposed a relatively arbitrary constraint on what has often been a more free-form built
environment assessment in other Our Voice projects
[32]. Additionally, this pilot study allowed participants
to investigate a variety of urban spaces, though future
iterations may pursue a more in-depth exploration of a
single, specific space, such as a park or plaza. Quantified self researchers may also find utility in collecting
individual geo-tagged biometric stress data over several
hours or days in future “n-of-1” studies or interventions
[60]. Importantly, the method described here is sufficiently flexible to be tailored to the research questions
of new projects, but provides key capabilities for collecting and visualizing different kinds of objective and
perceived participant data.
Ultimately, the questions raised during the study
may also prompt deeper qualitative analyses. As a participant eloquently summarized in one of her audio
narratives:

There’s this interesting dichotomy that I don’t know
how to express in a photograph which is the pleasure of being in a complex urban environment balanced with a serenity and beauty. Both are pleasing, one is more intense which maybe might make
you… maybe my biometrics feel aggravated or
disoriented in some ways but that is one of the reasons we love cities so we should not optimize out a
sense of complexity and chaos because that too is
beautiful.

Fig. 5 Participant data maps. While these two participants also documented the same feature, they gave it different ratings and descriptions in
terms of it being a positive or negative aspect of the built environment

These pilot data provide a starting point for researchers and citizen scientists to “triangulate” between the
objective, perceived, and embodied experiences of
built environment spaces in ways that could lead to
new insights, including the beauty of “complexity and
chaos.”

Conclusion
Identifying elements of one’s environment—both
observable and unobservable—that contribute to allostatic load presents new opportunities to engage community residents in collecting and analyzing their
personal data to mobilize potential environmental
improvements. The current investigation provides a
systematic process of collecting these three types of
data, and lays a foundation for future spatial and statistical analyses in addition to more in-depth interpretation of how these responses vary within and between
participants. This type of multi-dimensional data collection procedure could be integrated into future built
environment or quantified self research projects where

biometric data are also of interest to community members, and our open-source mapping technology (R code
provided as Additional file 2) allows for easier replication in different settings and projects. It sets the stage
for additional research aimed at better understanding—
both qualitatively and quantitatively—how objective
and perceived elements of the built environment influence our “lived” experience in different settings, which
may impact people’s stress as well as well-being and
quality of life.

were on the same walk and took photographs of the same building. One
(at right) observed that they noticed this influence: “I find that when the
person I’m on a walk with takes a photo of something, I want to take a
photo of the same thing. But it’s true, this blue building is pretty excellent.”
