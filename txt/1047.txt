Abstract: Steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs)-based Brain-Computer interfaces (BCIs),
as well as eyetracking devices, provide a pathway for re-establishing communication for people
with severe disabilities. We fused these control techniques into a novel eyetracking/SSVEP hybrid
system, which utilizes eye tracking for initial rough selection and the SSVEP technology for fine
target activation. Based on our previous studies, only four stimuli were used for the SSVEP aspect,
granting sufficient control for most BCI users. As Eye tracking data is not used for activation of letters,
false positives due to inappropriate dwell times are avoided. This novel approach combines the
high speed of eye tracking systems and the high classification accuracies of low target SSVEP-based
BCIs, leading to an optimal combination of both methods. We evaluated accuracy and speed of
the proposed hybrid system with a 30-target spelling application implementing all three control
approaches (pure eye tracking, SSVEP and the hybrid system) with 32 participants. Although the
highest information transfer rates (ITRs) were achieved with pure eye tracking, a considerable amount
of subjects was not able to gain sufficient control over the stand-alone eye-tracking device or the pure
SSVEP system (78.13% and 75% of the participants reached reliable control, respectively). In this
respect, the proposed hybrid was most universal (over 90% of users achieved reliable control), and
outperformed the pure SSVEP system in terms of speed and user friendliness. The presented hybrid
system might offer communication to a wider range of users in comparison to the standard techniques.

1. Introduction
Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide a communication channel without the involvement
of muscular activity [1,2]. Through the detection of specific brain patterns, in the noninvasively
acquired electroencephalogram (EEG) data, users are enabled to perform direct commands in real
time. BCIs have therefore the potential to be utilized as assistive technology for people with restricted
motor abilities.
In this article we present a communication system that is based on the Steady-State Visually
Evoked Potential (SSVEP) BCI paradigm [3–5]. SSVEP-based BCIs can be categorized as reactive BCI
paradigm as it is based on the response to an external stimuli. Potentials are evoked at a certain
frequency if the gaze is fixated on a flickering target at the same frequency.
Though SSVEP-based BCIs have been proven to be usable by most, if not all healthy users [6,7],
there is an ongoing debate and concern regarding its dependency on eye gaze, which excludes patients
with lack of oculomotor control from using such systems. Although some researchers address this issue

showing that SSVEPs can also be controlled by shifting attention rather than gaze and striving towards
so-called independent SSVEP-based BCI [8–10], the majority of studies—to some extend—allow gaze
shift. Such systems then compete with other healthcare applications based on gaze direction such as
eye trackers.
Eye trackers are devices which calculate gaze coordinates on the screen according to measured
eye positions. So called video occulography eye trackers use a video camera which can be positioned in
front of a subject or be head mounted (e.g., on eyeglasses frame), to track the position of the eyes [11,12].
Eye trackers are considered as robust and are already an established technology as communication
systems for disabled persons; commercial systems such as the Tobii eye tracking devices (Tobii AB,
Danderyd, Stockholm, Sweden) have become a valuable tool in augmentative communication [13–15].
The general consensus seems to be that eye tracking devices generally outperform SSVEP BCIs
as they are faster and the required setup is much simpler. However, some studies suggest that
the performance gap between the two technologies might be smaller than expected. Kishore et al.
compared the two methods in a head-mounted display (HMD) hardware as a means of controlling
gestures of a humanoid robot [16]. They found that both methods are appropriate for usage in
immersive settings. All ten SSVEP participants triggered at least one gesture during the test. However,
results for the Eye Tracker were surprisingly poor. Two out of ten eye tracker participants did not
succeed in triggering gestures with the robot. They stated though, that there were technological
differences in their setup compared to existing literature. Kos’myna and Tarpin-Bernard tested eye
tracking in combination with different BCI paradigms in a gaming setup. Although they observed that
the combination of eye tracking and SSVEP was slightly slower, it was more accurate than the pure eye
tracker [17]. They concluded that the combination of the eye tracker and SSVEP was a well-rounded
and natural combination.
One major obstacle with the eye tracking technology is, the so called, Midas touch problem
(see e.g., [18]). Usually the activation of a selected target object is based on dwell times; the user has to
focus on a target object for an extended period. But the system cannot differentiate intentional from
unintentional fixation, which can easily lead to false classifications. One way to solve this problem is
to use a BCI for target activation (see e.g., [19]).
For SSVEP-based BCIs another problem can occur. If consecutive commands are performed in
a row (e.g., in spelling) the user needs to shifts her/his gaze between targets. EEG data collected
during this gaze shifting phase is not relevant for the identification of any stimuli. That is why many
researchers include automatic pauses after classifications in their applications to give the user a fixed
amount of time to find the next target. However, the time needed to find the next target, depends on
their arrangement, the familiarity with the application, as well as user factors, hence, the length of the
pause provided by the system might not be optimal and slow the system down. A more user specific
pause for gaze shifting could be determined with eye tracking.
If gaze control is not restricted, it is convenient to combine BCIs and eye tracking devices.
Several hybrid systems combining eye trackers with BCI approaches have been developed with
applications for controlling robotic limb prosthetics [20], quadrocopters [21], games [17] and
communication tools [19,22,23].
Several hybrid systems utilize a BCI as a supportive technology for eye tracking. In such
technologies, usually the eye tracking device is used for selection and the BCI for the activation
of an object, circumventing the Midas touch problem described above. E.g., Vilmek and Zander
proposed a spelling system using eye tracking for target selection and an imaginary movement based
BCI for simulating a mouse click [19]. They stated that their hybrid system was somewhat slower but
more reliable in comparison to standard dwell time based eye tracking interfaces. However, no direct
comparisons between the BCI and the eye tracking systems were made.
McCullagh et al. used an EyeTribe tracker (The Eye Tribe ApS, Copenhagen, Denmark) for gaze
coordinates and EEG-data recorded with an Emotiv EPOC (Emotiv, San Francisco, CA, USA) for
selection [24]. Their hybrid approach maintained information transfer rate (ITR) while accuracy and

Brain Sci. 2017, 4, 35

efficiency were increased. They also stated that the ITR of both, the tested eye tracking device and the
hybrid were higher in comparison to a previous SSVEP-only system.
Another approach is to use the eye tracker component as a complementary technology to
the BCI. Lim et al. used the information of eye gaze direction detected by a low cost web-cam to
prevent typing errors in an SSVEP-based BCI spelling application [23]. In online experiments with
10 participants, almost 40% of typos were prevented which shows that their system could reduce
typing errors significantly.
The aforementioned methods have a clear distribution of tasks whereas the hybrid proposed in
this article utilizes a more balanced allocation of tasks between the eye tracker and the BCI.
The here presented novel system allows hand-free control over a 30 target spelling interface using
eye tracking for initial rough selection and the SSVEP technology for fine selection and activation.
As we found during previous research, SSVEP systems with four or less targets allow high classification
rates and offer control to a wide range of users [7]. Therefore, in this hybrid system we implemented
only four simultaneously flickering stimuli. The letters are arranged in a 6 × 5 target matrix. If the
user focuses on a specific letter, the area of the desired target is determined via eye tracking and
a block of four letters starts flickering. As each of these four letters has a specific individual stimulation
frequency, the system is able to classify a command. Gaze coordinates are tracked simultaneously in
the background, allowing the user to switch to another block of letters if the initial area is false.
This method has several advantages:
•
•
•
•

Eye tracking data is not used for activation of letters, the Midas touch problem is circumvented.
Dynamic gaze shifting phases, ensuring that EEG data are only considered if the target object
is fixated.
Only four SSVEP stimuli need to be distinguished resulting in high classification accuracy.
Little precision is expected from the eye tracking device, allowing a low cost hardware solution.

The presented article evaluates the feasibility of the proposed system and compares its
performance to a pure SSVEP as well as a pure eye tracking system. In this respect a 30-target user
interface was implemented for each of the three approaches.
2. Experimental Section
2.1. Participants
In total 32 able-bodied volunteer participants (six female) with mean (SD) age of 25.16
(7.71) years, ranging from 19 to 63 were recruited from the Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences
(Kleve, Germany). Participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and had little to no previous
experience with BCI systems. They gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki before taking part in the experiment. This research was approved by the ethical committee
of the medical faculty of the University Duisburg-Essen. Information needed for the analysis of the test
was stored pseudonymously. The entire session lasted on average approximately 50 min. Participants
had the opportunity to withdraw at any time.
The EEG recordings were conducted in a quiet laboratory setting; luminance was kept low.
Participants did not receive any financial reward.
2.2. Hardware
Participants were seated in front of a LCD screen (BenQ XL2420T, Taipei, Taiwan, resolution:
1920 × 1080 pixels, vertical refresh rate: 120 Hz) at a distance of about 60 cm. The used computer system
operated on Microsoft Windows 7 Enterprise (Redmind, WA, USA) running on an Intel processor
(Intel Core i7, Santa Clara, CA, USA. 3.40 GHz). An electroencephalogram (EEG) amplifier, g.USBamp
(Guger Technologies, Graz, Austria) with standard Ag/AgCl electrodes were utilized. Eight signal
electrodes were located over the visual cortex (PZ , PO3 , PO4 , O1 , O2 , OZ , O9 and O10 in accordance with

Brain Sci. 2017, 4, 35

the international system of EEG electrode placement). The ground electrode was placed over AFZ ,
the reference electrode over CZ . Standard abrasive electrolytic electrode gel was applied between
the electrodes and the scalp in order to bring impedances below 5 kΩ. An analogue bandpass filter
between 2 and 30 Hz and a notch filter of around 50 Hz were applied in the g.USBamp amplifier.
For the eye tracking aspect, we used the low cost EyeTribe tracker with the provided software
development kit. The EyeTribe is a video-based tracker, which uses binocular gaze data and high
resolution infrared LED illumination [25]. The data rate of the EyeTribe was set to 30 Hz. The software
development kit provides a calibration interface which ensures a correct position of the device and
identifies unique eye characteristics needed to enhance the accuracy of the tracker. The EyeTribe tracker
was mounted on a tripod and was placed in front of the monitor, facing the user. It was connected to
the computer via the universal serial bus (USB 3.0 port).
2.3. Signal Processing
For SSVEP signal classification, the minimum energy combination method (MEC) as proposed by
Friman et al. in [26] was utilized. The MEC creates a set of channels (a weighted combination of the
electrode signals) which minimize the nuisance signals. Considering Nt samples of EEG data, recorded
for each of Ny signal electrodes, the SSVEP response for a flickering stimuli of f Hz, measured with the
i-th electrode, can be described as function of the frequency f and its harmonics k, with corresponding
amplitudes ai,k and bi,k :
Nh

yi ( t ) =

∑ ai,k sin(2πk f t) + bi,k cos(2πk f t) + Ei,t

(1)

k =1

The term Ei,t represents the noise component of the electrode i, the various artifacts that cannot
attribute to the SSVEP response. For a time segment length of Ts , acquired with a sampling frequency
of FE Hz, the model can be described in a vector form as yi = Xτi + Ei where yi = [yi (1), . . . , yi ( Nt )] T
and X describes the Nt × 2Nh SSVEP model matrix containing the sine and cosine components.
Further, the vector τi contains the corresponding amplitudes ai,k and bi,k .
To cancel out the nuisance and noise, Ns channel vectors si , i = 1, . . . , Ns of length Nt are defined
as a linear combination of the electrode signals; the Nt × Ns matrix S = [s1 , . . . , s Ns ] can be written as
S = XW, where the Nt × Ns matrix W contains the corresponding weights.
The noise and nuisance signals can be estimated by removing the SSVEP components from
the signal. In this respect, the signal Y is projected on the orthogonal complement of the SSVEP
model matrix,
Ỹ = Y − X ( X T X )−1 X T Y.
(2)
As B ≈ Ỹ, an optimal weight combination for the electrode signals can then be found by
T
calculating the eigenvectors of the symmetric
 matrix Ỹ Ỹ
 (please refer to [27] for more details).
The weight matrix can be set to W =

, where λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ . . . λ Ns are the calculated

eigenvalues with corresponding eigenvectors vi .
To discard up to 90% of the nuisance signal the total number of channels is selected by finding the
smallest value for Ns that satisfies the equation:

> 0.1.

To detect the SSVEP response for a specific frequency, the power of that frequency and its
harmonics Nh is estimated by

where α was set to 0.25.
2.4. Software
The EEG signal classification and processing, as well as the graphical user interface, were
implemented as Microsoft Visual Studio C++ project (Version 2010, Redmond, WA, USA). For eye
tracking, source files from the C++ GazeApi library provided by the Eyetribe C++ software
development kit (SDK) were included manually into the project. Three different spelling
applications were tested in the experiment: the SSVEP speller, solely based on the SSVEP paradigm,
the Eyegaze speller, solely based on eye tracking, and the Hybrid, a combination of both control
technologies. Figure 1 provides a system overview of the tested applications. In each application,
thirty boxes containing the alphabet plus additional special characters were presented to the user.
Command classifications were followed by an audio feedback voicing the selected command. Table 1
summarizes the main characteristics of each interface. A detailed description of each speller is provided

SSVEP speller: For the SSVEP speller, as well as the Hybrid, the MEC was utilized as described
above. To avoid overlapping of frequencies, Nh = 2 harmonic frequencies were considered. For the
SSVEP speller, power estimations for N f = 30 frequencies were calculated. Each block consisted of
13 samples (101.5625 ms with the sampling rate of 128 Hz). For the on-line classification, we used
block-wise increasing classification time windows instead of sliding windows, as we learned that
some users benefit from larger time segments (see e.g., [7]). If a particular stimulation frequency
had the highest probability, exceeded a certain predefined threshold and the classification time
window exceeded a certain minimum threshold, the corresponding command was classified. As more
frequencies needed to be distinguished, the minimum classification time windows was set to 20 blocks
(approximately 2 s), in order to avoid false classifications. After each performed classification the
flickering stopped for approximately 914 ms (9 blocks) and no EEG data were collected, so that during
this gaze shifting period, the user had time to shift her/his gaze to another target.
In the SSVEP speller, each box represented a stimulation frequency; the box size varied
(between 130 × 90 and 170 × 120 pixels) in relation to the SSVEP power estimations during the
experiment as described in [29]. Each box was outlined by a frame determining the maximum box size
which was reached immediately prior to the classification.
To implement the 30 stimulation frequencies, a frame-based stimulus approximation was used
(see e.g., [30,31]). In the frame-based stimulus approximation method, a varying number of frames is
used in each cycle. The stimulus signal at frequency f is generated by
stim( f , i ) = square[2π f (i/RefreshRate)],

where square(2π f t) generates a square wave with frequency f and i is the frame index.
E.g., the black/white reversing interval for the approximated frequency 17 Hz includes 17 cycles
of varying length (three or four frames). For example, by using the formula above, the one-second
stimulus sequence of 17 Hz can be generated: (4 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 3).
For the online spelling task with the SSVEP speller, approximated frequencies between 6.1 and
11.8 Hz (resolution < 0.2 Hz) were used. This interval was applied in previous studies as well, because
it avoids overlapping in the 2-nd harmonics frequencies while still allowing a sufficient difference
in-between [32]. As indicated in [33], an equidistant stimuli set is not optimal, hence we selected
30 logarithmically spaced frequencies as displayed in Figure 2.

Eyegaze speller: This application used the eye movements as input modality. Each box could
be selected by looking at it. The selected box was highlighted white, while the 29 remaining boxes
were grey.
The EyeTribe tracker calculated gaze coordinates e = ( x, y) with respect to the monitor at which
the participants were looking at. In order to detect the gaze box a user was focusing on, exponentially
weighted moving averages (EWMAs) were utilized. In the EWMA, a weighted average between the
current value and the average of the last observation is averaged. For a series of sample coordinate
vectors et the EWMA was calculated recursively:
ê1 = e1 , êt = (1 − α)êt−1 + αet , for t > 1.

(6)

We used α = 0.0625 to put more weight on the past value. After a time window of 0.33 s (10 sample
coordinates), the box with the minimum distance to the average gaze position ê = ê10 was highlighted
white, however, in order to spell the letter contained in the box, it needed to be classified three times in
a row. Hence the minimum time to select a character was 1 s. After a letter selection, letter classification
was suppressed for the duration of 2 s to avoid false classifications.
Hybrid: The Hybrid operated in two phases. Firstly, only eye tracking was utilized, as described
above, but instead of a single box, a block of the four nearest boxes to the averaged coordinates were
highlighted, as displayed in Figure 3. In total, twenty overlapping blocks were selectable. After three
consecutive selections of a block (minimum time 1 s), the corresponding boxes started flickering
with four individual frequencies, initiating the second phase. However, gaze coordinates were still
calculated in the background. Therefore, if the initial selection was false, the user still could switch
to another block of letters by shifting her/his gaze. If the letters of this new block did not overlap
with the letters of the preceding block, the flickering stopped. In the occasion that the calculated gaze
coordinates were directly in the center of a box, up to four overlapping blocks had the exact same
distance to the gaze coordinates. In this case, the lower right block had highest precedence.
To ensure that each block contained four different frequencies, they were arranged as displayed
in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Frequency arrangement for the Hybrid. Stimuli f 1 = 6.00 Hz, f 2 = 6.67 Hz, f 3 = 7.5 Hz and
f 4 = 8.57 Hz were used. Initially one of twenty gaze boxes ei was determined using the eye tracker (a).
If, e.g., the box e8 was classified, the four buttons “I,J,O,P” started to flicker allowing the selection of
an individual letter via steady state visual evoked potentials (b).

The first phase can also be seen as a dynamic gaze shifting period. Flickering started only if the
user fixated the block containing the desired letter for a sufficiently long period of time.
In order to increase robustness, for the Hybrid, three additional frequencies (means between the
four target frequencies) were used as in [34], hence N f = 7. In particular, the additional frequencies
6.33, 7.09 and 8.13 Hz were considered. However, if one of these frequencies was classified, the output

Brain Sci. 2017, 4, 35

was rejected. This way the reliability of the output was improved, as the risk of false positives
e.g., during gaze shifting was considerably reduced. Only if a particular stimulation frequency had
the highest probability, exceeded a certain predefined threshold and the classification time window
exceeded a certain minimum time period, the corresponding command was classified. As more
frequencies needed to be distinguished for the SSVEP speller, the minimum classification time windows
was set to 20 blocks (approximately 2 s) for this application, in order to avoid false classifications.
EEG data were transferred block-wise to the computer. The minimum SSVEP classification time
window for the Hybrid was set to 8 blocks (approximately 0.8 s). Figure 4 compares the eye tracking
accuracy needed for the Hybrid and the Eyegaze speller.

Figure 4. Selecting the letter “I” with the Hybrid (a) and the Eyegaze speller interface (b). In the Hybrid
system the eye tracking data was used for initial rough selection. If the traced eye coordinates
lay within the yellow rectangle (11 cm × 19 cm), the box containing the desired letter started
flickering. If eye tracking was used alone, the traced coordinates needed to be much more precise
(5.5 cm × 9.5 cm rectangle on the right hand side). The eye tracking software calculated the user’s
eye gaze coordinates with an average accuracy of around 0.5◦ to 1◦ of visual angle depending on the
calibration, which corresponded to an on-screen average error of 0.5 to 1 cm, assuming the user sat
approximately 60 cm away from the screen.

2.5. Experimental Setup
Initially, participants were prepared for the EEG recording. Thereafter, the eye tracker was
calibrated. After accurate positioning in front of the device was ensured, the calibration software
provided by the EyeTribe SDK presented a series of calibration targets which were distributed evenly
throughout the screen. The calibration process took on average about 30 s to complete. Participants
were instructed not to move their head during this calibration phase. Also, participants were asked
not to wear their glasses during the experiment, as they affect the performance of the low cost eye
tracker system. If the calibration results were poor, re-calibrating was performed.
Afterwards, participants tested the spelling applications as follows: Initially, subjects participated in
a familiarization run, spelling the word “KLEVE” and a word of their own choice (e.g., their first name).
Next, each participant used each GUI in random order to spell the phrase “RHINE WAAL
UNIVERSITY”. The spelling phase ended automatically when the phrase was spelled correctly. In case
a person was not able to execute a desired classification within a certain time frame, or if repeated false
classifications occurred, the experiment was stopped manually. Spelling errors were corrected via the
“delete” button. After the test phase, the subjects completed a post-questionnaire, answering questions
regarding each spelling application.

each application.
The accuracy P was calculated based on the number of correct command classifications divided
by the total number of classified commands Cn . To obtain ITR in bits per minute, B is multiplied by the
number of command classifications per minute. To obtain the average command classification time,
the total time needed for the spelling task, T, was divided by Cn .

In some cases, the system was unable to reliably detect the users intent. Participants who were
unable to complete the spelling task, or who achieved classification accuracies below 70% were
excluded from the calculation of the mean values; these participants, for the sake of brevity, we refer to
as BCI illiterates and we define the BCI literacy rate as the percentage of BCI literate participants.
Every participant was able to control at least one of the systems. Out of the 32 participants,
29 were able to gain control over the Hybrid, 25 over the Eyegaze speller and 24 over the SSVEP speller.
18 participants were able to complete the tasks with all three applications. For these subjects a detailed
performance comparison was conducted (see Table 3). The typing speed in chars/min was obtained
by dividing the total number of spelled letters (including errors and error corrections) by T. A series
of T-tests revealed that with the Eyegaze speller a significant higher ITR than both the SSVEP speller
(t(17) = 13.924, p = 0.000) and the Hybrid (t(17) = 11.238, p = 0.000) was achieved. On the other hand,
the ITR for the proposed Hybrid was significantly higher than for the SSVEP speller (t(17) = 3.634,
p = 0.002). Likewise, with the Eyegaze speller a significantly higher accuracy compared to the SSVEP
speller (t(17) = 3.160, p = 0.006) and the Hybrid (t(17) = 2.747, p = 0.014) was achieved. Though the mean
accuracy of the Hybrid (93.87%) was slightly higher than the SSVEP speller (90.81%), the difference was
not statistically significant (t(17) = 1.360, p = 0.191).
Table 3. Mean (SD) values achieved for the 18 participants who completed the tasks with all three
applications: the steady-state visual evoked potentials based application (SSVEP speller), the here
presented Hybrid application, and the eye tracking based application (Eyegaze speller). The presented
values are: the overall accuracy, the information transfer rate (ITR), the characters/minute, an the
overall time needed to complete the spelling task). Subjects that were not able to successfully control
all three spelling interfaces were excluded from the calculation of mean values.

Figure 5 summarizes results from the post questionnaire for all subjects. The subjective
impressions regarding user friendliness were measured using a five-point Likert scale, where “1”
indicated the strongest degree of disagreement with a particular statement and “5” the strongest
degree of agreement.
Figure 6 compares command classification time for each of the letters form the copy spelling
task; the boxplot displays Minimum, Maximum and Median values, as well as Outliers. Note, that in
two cases for the Eyegaze-speller, classification data was already collected in the background when the
recording started and as a result, the first letter was selected in less than one second (e.g., Subject 3 and 5).
Several participants needed a considerable amount of time to complete the spelling task with
the SSVEP-speller. In order to analyze the long trial performance, classification accuracies for slow
and fast performers were compared. In total, 6 participants needed more than 4 min to write the
phrase (slow performers); 11 participants completed the task in less than 3 min (fast performers).
Figure 7 suggests that selection accuracy is slightly diminishing over the course of the spelling task for
slow performers. To analyze this performance drop further, the classification means of the first and
final five letters (94.5% and 87.2%) for slow performers were calculated. The observed difference was
not significant (t(5) = 1.547, p = 0.182)).

4. Discussion
The results demonstrate, that while the Eyegaze speller was the fastest system overall,
the combination of eye tracking and SSVEP showed a faster performance than the SSVEP system alone.
All participants gained control over at least one of three systems, yet, the literacy rate differed for each
of the systems. In this respect, the proposed Hybrid achieved the highest literacy rate; 90.63% of the
participants achieved reliable control with the Hybrid, 78.13 with the Eyegaze speller, and 75% with the
SSVEP speller.
The speed difference between SSVEP and eye tracking technology was expected. A relatively long
time window is necessary until the SSVEP power estimations allow accurate classification. A direct
comparison of a letter selection with the SSVEP speller and the Eyegaze speller is provided in Figure 8.

An explanation why the Hybrid was controlled by more users than the SSVEP speller is the fewer
number of SSVEP targets. This also allowed shorter SSVEP classification time windows and hence
resulted in a overall faster performance. For the Hybrid, the minimum time for SSVEP classification
was below 1 s. On the other hand, for the SSVEP speller, we used time windows with minimal length of
roughly 2 s, a rather typical value throughout BCI literature (see e.g., [35]). It should be noted though,
that some studies successfully used smaller time windows for multi-target systems (see e.g., [31]).
Another advantage of the Hybrid is that the gaze shifting phase was accessed via eye tracking.
Therefore, it was ensured that a user is concentrating on a target letter during the collection of EEG data.
Figure 9 displays the entire spelling performance of a subject. It can be seen that the gaze shifting
period indeed differs for each selection. e.g., for the selection of the consecutive “A”s, the gaze shifting
period was as expected the smallest.
A considerable amount of users were not able to control the Eyegaze speller. As also observed by
Janthanasub and Meesad, the calibration of the eye tracking device was relatively poor or not possible
at all for participants with glasses [25]. We like to point out though, that more expensive eye-trackers
might perform more reliably when glasses are worn in comparison to the eye-tracker used in our
experiment. Future developments in camera based tracking or wearable devices might circumvent
this issue. To compare eye tracking and SSVEP independent of the interference of glasses with the
tracking, participants were asked to perform this experiment without visual aid, even if usually glasses
were worn.

visual evoked potentials power estimations are displayed as a function of time; the grey boxes represent
the eye tracking phases. Eye tracking paths from (a) “R” to “H” and (b) “S” to “I” are provided.

Despite this, 21.87% of the participants were not successful with the eye tracker. Other factors
prevented reliable control as well; for example, participant related eye physiology (e.g., narrow eyes)
tended to worsen trackability as also observed by Bilignaut and Wium [36]. The Midas touch
problem seemed not to be an issue for most participants. Other researchers observed variability
among participants in eye tracking performance as well. Räihä and Ovaska also discussed long term
use performance [37]. They observed that during a one hour test run with an eye typing system,
some participants were unable to complete the experiment due to eye fatigue, while other participants
were not affected at all. The authors further listed reasons why eye fatigue may arise: poor calibration,

Brain Sci. 2017, 4, 35

14 of 17

participants frustration, system settings, mental demand, experimental conditions (e.g., temporal
demand); also, the use of infrared light over longer time periods may cause discomfort, frustration
and dryness of the eye. Eye fatigue can also be an issue with SSVEP-based BCIs (see e.g., [38]).
Here, a slightly diminishing accuracy for slow performers was observed (see Figure 7. Apart from
fatigue, higher stimulation frequencies towards the end of the phrase could explain the drop.
All in all, subjects gave generally positive feedback regarding the user friendliness of all
tested systems (see Figure 5). Regarding the question if the system was easily controlled, the eye
tracking system gathered the highest number of extreme answers (strong disagreement/agreement).
The perceived level of control for the Hybrid was slightly better than for the SSVEP speller.
Also, the majority of the subjects were more annoyed by the flickering of the SSVEP speller compared to
the Hybrid. Fewer stimuli seemed generally to be less stressful for the user (see e.g., [39]). In addition,
the time the subject had to look at a flickering target was larger for the SSVEP speller. Higher stimulation
frequencies produce less visual fatigue and are more subtle than lower frequencies [40,41] , but their
SSVEP amplitudes are significantly lower (see e.g., [27]). Especially for multi-target applications,
BCI performance might drop to such an extent that reliable control is not possible. Because of this,
we used lower frequencies in the tested applications.
As for the graphical user interface, we decided to use an alphabetically ordered layout as for
some users a standard keyboard layout such as QWERTY might be unfamiliar. For people who use
a QWERTZ or QWERTY keyboard regularly the interface could be modified. It should be noted,
that an equal distribution of selectable targets on the screen might be more efficient in terms of data
processing; that is why letters were arranged in a 6 × 5 matrix in the GUI implementation. If e.g., 10 or
more letters are used in a row, as typical for the QWERTY keyboard arrangement, the data processing
strategy of the hybrid needs to be altered accordingly.
It should be also noted that although the system is designed as a communication tool for
disabled people, most of the subjects in this study were healthy young adults. Also, a few of the
participants had previous BCI-experience. Therefore, they may not be reflective of the target population.
E.g., Käthner et al. stress the importance of engaging end-users during all steps of developement
process [42]. They tested eye tracker, electrooculography and an auditory BCI as access methods
for augmentative communication. The participant, a 55 year old amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
patient in locked-in state, rated the ease of use of the auditory BCI as the highest, as no precise eye
movements were required, but at the same time as most tiring due to the high level of attention that
was necessary to control the BCI. Demographic factors influence BCI performance as well; elderly
people for example are slightly poorer BCI performers [43,44]. Future tests with the target population
are required.
We also like to mention that while we used a low cost eye tracking device, our SSVEP setup
was state-of-art which makes the comparison somewhat biased towards the SSVEP paradigm.
However, results from from Kos’myna and Tarpin-Bernard suggest that 4 classes could also be
successfully distinguished with a low cost device such as the Emotiv Epoch [17]. A low cost version of
the here proposed Hybrid might therefore be possible.
Although slightly slower, the presented SSVEP/eye-tracking combination proofed to be
a well-rounded alternative to the pure eye tracking device. The proposed system could however be
improved further. In terms of speed, reliability and user comfort, both individual control methods
have by far not reached their full potential. But also, their combination offers further improvement
possibilities. As recorded EEG signals are affected by non-neuronal activities such as eye blinking and
eye movements, eye tracker data can be used to remove such ocular artifacts from EEG signal [45].
Our future work should include this feature as well.
5. Conclusions
The article presents a novel eye tracking/SSVEP hybrid spelling application and compares
its performance to standalone SSVEP and eye tracking versions of the interface. Generally with

Brain Sci. 2017, 4, 35

15 of 17

eye tracking devices, a large number of targets can be distinguished. With SSVEP-based BCIs high
resolution control can also be achieved as demonstrated in several studies. However, due to the high
number of distinguishable targets, some users struggle to control either systems. A comparison
of mean values revealed that ITR as well as classification accuracy were highest with the pure
eye tracking interface, however, the amount of users who gained control was maximal for the
proposed hybrid system. It is worth noting, that control over the pure eye tracking interface implied
control over the hybrid system, but not vice versa. This indicates that through the data fusion of
the two technologies, a wider range of users could access control over hand-free communication
applications. Further advantages of the Hybrid system are more dynamic gaze shifting phases between
consecutive selections and potentially less expensive hardware in comparison.
