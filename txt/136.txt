ABSTRACT

Article history:

In the last decade, numerous researches in the field of electro-encephalography (EEG) and brain-computer-interface (BCI) have been accomplished.
BCI has been developed to aid disabled/partially disabled people
to efficiently communicate with the community. This paper presents
a control tool using the Neurosky Mindwave headset, which detects
brainwaves (voluntary blinks and attention) to form a braincomputer interface (BCI) by receiving the system signals from the frontal
lobe. This paper proposed an alternative computer input device for those
disabled people (who are physically challenged) rather than the conventional
one. The work suggested to use two virtual keyboard designs. The conducted
experiment revealed a significant result in developing user printing skills on
PCs. Encouraging results (1.55-1.8 word per minute (WPM)) were obtained
in this research in comparison to other studies.

INTRODUCTION
The brain is an essential part of the human body, which controls movement, behaviour and regulates
the equilibrium of the human body. The brain provides cognition; exudes emotions; stores memories and
directs muscular or motor activities [1]. There are over 86 billion neurons in the average human brain, and
there are various other cells, which almost equal that number too. The interconnection of neurons is crucial
for brain activity, as these neurons form an associative link between brain cells [2]. Figure 1 [3], shows
the classification of the human brain, which defines regions within the brain as the forebrain, midbrain, and
hindbrain. The Midbrain mostly comprises of a portion of the brainstem, which controls some reflex actions
and is a portion of the circuit; concerned with the regulation of eye movements and other voluntary
movements. The general definition of the (brain) hemisphere happens into four lobes, namely–the frontal
lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe and occipital lobe [4]. Perception involves sensing the signals from
the external environment and is the major function of the human brain, which is at the core of understanding
human senses, feeling and emotion. Furthermore, regulating and controlling the human behaviours;
regulating and controlling physical actions; regulating memory functions; the method of thinking and other
reasoning processes [5]. Medical professionals use Electroencephalography (EEG) to diagnose abnormalities
in human life [6]. EEG is an electrophysiological monitoring technique that logs the electrical signals
emanating from the brain. EEG senses the electrical potential difference resulting from neurological ionic
currents produced by the brain [7]. EEG provides an automatic real-time recording of the brain's electrical

activity using multiple electrodes positioned on the scalp [8]. The past few years have seen a rapid progress
of EEG-based BCI; that meteoric rise partly attributes to computer processing and speed improvements; also,
that is due to signal analysis technique refinements. That work has produced results with applicable clinical
applications [9]. BCI is a revolutionary technology, which reads the user's mind directly from the brain and
transforms to the commands of a controllable device, bypassing the peripheral neural system [10]. The motor
imagery based BCI system is an essential type of BCI. Traditional motor images produced by BCI acquires
data through specific processes, then performs data analysis offline to choose the best channel and
parameters [11]. Invasive and Non-Invasive are two essential types of BCI arrangements. Invasive BCI
arrangements install a chip inside the brain, which records the brain activity [12]; this is often impractical
because this requires brain surgery, while non-invasive types use a headset device and are externally placed
on the scalp which measures brain activity [3].

Figure 1. The brain hemisphere

A previous study presented by [13], develops a BCI system using a Mindwave headset. That study
senses the activity of the brain and encodes the response in MATLAB, and the decision making, which
enables smart home device control uses an Arduino module. The study conducted by [14] employs a P300
BCI system to output digital text. That system displays pulsating characters and a classifier, which
determines target characters. Typically, a user must type each symbol within a word at a time. That spelling
process is slow, and it can take many minutes to output an entire word. Another research by [15], employs
a BCI system to control four-wheel electric vehicles. Emotiv EPOC+ is used to acquire the raw EEG
data.Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is used to pre-process the motor imagery EEG; feature
extraction involves a Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), which are most related to the ERD/ERS. That research
leads to the development of a non-invasive BCI, which realizes the intent of the visual cortex by equating
EEG-SSVEP signals to control a wheelchair [16] automatically. That system uses offline data analysis to
enable user motive control of the electric wheelchair.
The research conducted by [17] develops a BCI based keyboard with long-term potential for areas
such as learning, training, brain stimulation and other clinical purposes. That study presents an average
accuracy improvement of all the users from a 40% error rate in the first round to a 10.5% error rate in
the fourth round of the trials. This paper describes the use of a low-cost, non-invasive BCI type system,
which uses a Neurosky Mindwave headset. This system collects EEG data in real time, to enable people with
physical disabilities to communicate with others.

RESEARCH METHOD
This work successfully develops a BCI solution which detects and process brain signals in
a real-time. Five sub-blocks can represent the system, and the following is a description of
the microarchitecture design of each module shown in Figure 2.

2.1. EEG signal acquisition
The primary data acquisition element of the solution is the NeuroSkyMindWave headset. It is
an inexpensive, lightweight, portable device with wireless communication. It consists of eight parts, which
are a power switch, an ear clip, the ear arm, battery area, adjustable headband, sensor tip, sensor arm, and
think gear chip [18]. Two sensors are used to operate this device to obtain and filter EEG signals. The sensor
tip locates on the forehead and detects electrical signals emanating from the brain’s frontal lobe [19, 20].
The second sensor is an ear clip, which is used as a ground acting as a filter for electrical noise [21].
The NeuroSkyMindwave also has good measurement accuracy, which can result in a broader group of
potential users. Figure 3, explains the locations of the electrodes of the MindWave EEG headset in
the international 10/20 system [22].

2.2. Preprocessing
EEG raw signals are very low power signals collected from the user scalp, amplified, digitized and
transmitted through a Bluetooth module to the personal computer using the NeuroSkyMindWave device.
2.3. Features of EEG signals
An EEG signal comprises of rhythmic activity and transients. The rhythmic activity is divided into
wave bands by frequency while the transient is referring to spontaneous spikes and wave formations that are
sharp [23]. There are five types at the most critical frequency ranges: delta (2-4Hz), theta (4-8Hz),
alpha (8-12Hz), beta (15-30Hz), and gamma (30-80Hz) [6, 24].

2.4. Classification
The Neurosky uses the ThinkGear Technology to process and classify the EEG output considers
quantitative approaches to send signals via Bluetooth to the PC. The EEG processing protocols are closed
source software. The output data are Raw EEG signal, eSense Attention and Mediation is an integer value
between 0 and 100, Blink Strength is returning an integer value between 0 and 255 [18]. The "eSense
Attention" value is used to scan and initialize the virtual keyboard enabling user proper character choice.
The Blink Strength value is used to select characters or enables the cursor to move to the next row of
the virtual keyboard.
2.5. The virtual keyboard: design and work
The processing development environment (PDE) does process the data. A MindWaveWireless USB
Adapter receives the packets of data transmitted from the brain wave sensor. The Neurosky EEG sensor
obtains the attention and blink levels. If the attention value exceeds the threshold for a specific time, for
example 1 second, then the keyboard scan is 1 second, so the keyboard scan starts. The attention level is
received as a series of inputs, at a 1 Hz frequency, while the NeuroSky sensor obtains the unprocessed EEG
data at a 512 Hz frequency. The blinking level is used to select characters and enable the pointer to navigate
through the keyboard rows to hasten the writing process. The virtual keyboard is designed to contain
alphanumeric and control characters. It includes clear, space, screen and delete function characters, as shown
in Figure 4. There are thirty cells to provide a virtual keyboard, each alphabetic character and control running
a single cell. The cells are organized in a column fashion and arranged in a QWERTY design.

Figure 4. Virtual keyboard design

The red border box represents the cursor that moves on the keyboard so the user can visually
recognize the character select. Using a horizontal cursor movement, the user can select the correct character
and record within the text box in a second. Figure 5, describes a flow chart of the proposed work. Initially,
the NeuroSky headset is turned on, which in order to identify the neuro-signals. The EEG Biosensor capture
the signals and send them to the Think-Gear chip for processing. After analysis, the Java environment
receives digital signals for attentional extraction and utilizes the Blink Strength signals for further
classification. The text process uses eye blink and eye focus levels. The keyboard indicator begins to scan if
the signal level of attention exceeds the threshold for a specified period. If the Blink Strength value is
between the decimal numbers of 110 and 60, then that action chooses the text box character. If the Blink
Strength value exceeds the 110-decimal value, the pointer jumps between keyboard rows. The proposed
virtual keyboard uses one blink signal to select any row to increase text writing speed and obtain more text in
a fixed time.

The words per minute (WPM) variable provides the most frequent empirical metric of text entry
performance. It measures the period to produce a certain number of words. WPM is inconsiderate of
the number of keystrokes nor gestures types made during the text entry, but only considers text transcription
length, which is defined in (1) [25].

Where S is the time in seconds. 60 is a constant. The factor of one-fifth accounts for the average word length
in characters, including spaces, numbers, and other printable characters. Table 2, shows the text entry speed
and error rate of each subject for nine sessions. Figure 6 Shows the results for every participant, during nine
sessions and calculates the average time for all sessions. Figure 7 Shows the average entry speed of text

3.2. Second experiment
This experiment uses two types of virtual keyboards, QWERTY type as described previously, ABC
type consists of alphabets and two control characters defined as Delete and Space. The keyboard has 30 cells;
each alphabet occupies one cell character and two cells for each control button [17]. In this study, two types
of keyboard use square pointers. Both keyboards scan with a 600-millisecond delay to allow the user to select
a proper character. The persons are required to write a 24-letter sentence, including the white space character
within six sessions. The time required to write the chosen word was calculated as shown in Tables 3 and 4.
Figures 8 and 9 shows the average text entry speed and error rate of each person for this study.
The calculations of the text entry rate of various input methods is straight forward and simple.
In the first study, the users training to write the word HELP, and calculate the time taken, as shown
in Table 1. 75.83% accuracy obtained, and the WPM is 0.56, which equivalent to 2.8 letters per minute.
In the second study, the user is trained to write a sentence of 24 characters; by reducing the time taken to scan
the keyboard and switch between the buttons to be 600 milliseconds, using two types of keyboard design to
improved the proposed system. The first keyboard (QWERTY) contains three control buttons in addition to
the alphanumeric. The error rate was 5% and WPM = 1.55. The second type of keyboard designed as (ABC),
which contains two control buttons in addition to the alphanumeric. The error rate was 5.25% and
WPM = 1.8. The results of the proposed system exceed the performance of previous studies that enable
the user to write 7.75 to 9 characters per minute. Through the results obtained, it is possible to note
the improvement in the performance of the proposed system compared to the previous systems by looking at
the time taken to write most characters, taking into account the delay in the movement of the indicator
between pressing the buttons.

CONCLUSION
The proposed virtual keyboard uses EEG signal synchronized with human-eye blinking in term of
key selection for printing purposes. The obtained results were encouraging and were about (1.5-1.8 WPM)
with an error rate equals to (5-5.25)%. The results of experiments show that the best mode is the one that
used the ABC keyboard type. The next challenge focuses on designing a similar keyboard with predicting
capabilities with text output interface for native languages.
