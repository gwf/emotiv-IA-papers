Abstract
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have brought new, exciting and promising perspectives of interaction. On the
one hand, active BCIs enable users to control applications
(such as assistive technologies or video games) using their
brain activity alone. On the other hand, passive BCIs bring
the possibility of adapting an application/interface based
on users’ mental states. In this course, we first aim at introducing BCIs to the HCI community and to discuss how
BCI-based applications could benefit HCI. Then, in a practical session, we will propose all participants to implement
their own BCI, in a very simple way, using the free OpenViBE software. Finally, we will have discussions about what
is possible or not with BCIs, what are their pros and cons.

Introduction
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are systems that can
translate the brain activity of a user – typically measured
using ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) – into a command
for an interactive application [1]. For instance, a BCI can

enable a user to move a cursor to the left or right of a computer screen by imagining left or right hand movements respectively. Since they make computer control possible without any physical activity, EEG-based BCIs have promised
to revolutionize many applications areas, notably to control
assistive technologies (e.g. control of text input systems
or wheelchairs) for motor-impaired users or as input devices for entertainment and Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI). BCI technologies can also be used beyond communication and control, as a tool to monitor brain activity and
mental states to assess interactive systems ergonomics or
to design adaptive interfaces reacting to the user’s mental
states. BCIs are thus increasingly used in the HCI community. However, BCI design is highly multidisciplinary, involving computer science, signal processing, cognitive neurosciences and psychology, among others. As such, fully
understanding and using BCI can be difficult. This course
aims at making this possible by providing the audience with
an overview of BCI design, research and application.

movements to control an
application – see, e.g. [4].

Benefits
Such a course is a great opportunity to make innovative research challenges emerge and to create collaborations between the HCI and BCI communities. Indeed, the BCI community could greatly benefit from HCI researchers’ expertise in designing and evaluating their training protocols and
applications while on the other hand, the HCI community
will have a better idea of how they could use BCIs either as
a new control modality or as an evaluation tool. At the end
of the course, participants will know the different types of
BCIs and what can be done with each of them. They will
also be able to design and implement their own BCI using
the open-source BCI platform OpenViBE. Finally, perceiving
BCIs with their real capabilities – beyond science fiction and
mainstream media reports – should help HCI professionals
to be aware of the pitfalls to avoid and the ethical issues to

consider when designing a BCI protocol.

Content
The course is composed of three sessions, where each
session lasts around 80 minutes. The first session will provide an introduction to the main BCI types and applications,
with basic signal processing techniques. The second session will be a hands-on one, covering practical BCI design
and use, with an introduction to real-time processing of actual EEG recordings using OpenViBE [5]. The last session
will involve interactive discussions to introduce the audience
with BCIs ethics, with their real capabilities, and with the
way to conduct rigorous BCI research.
Session 1: An introduction to BCI
The first session will start with a brief history of BCIs and
their purpose. We will then introduce “active BCIs” – controlling an application using brain-activity alone (e.g. [4]) –
and “passive BCIs” – enhancing interaction by considering
physiological data, such as monitoring workload (Figure 2)
[2]. Multiple examples of the use of BCIs among various
scientific communities will be given. Afterwards, the neuromarkers used for designing these BCIs will be explained.
We will also describe the approaches for processing EEG
signals and extracting relevant features. Finally we will
mention some of the latest advances in BCI research, such
as the use of instructional design to improve user training
protocols.
Session 2: Practical BCI design and use with the OpenViBE
software
This session will provide practical exercises for designing
a BCI system. To do so, we will bring both medical grade
EEG (a Brain Products LiveAmp), and consumer grade
EEG (Emotiv and/or OpenBCI). We will show the audience
how to record EEG signals with them (pros and cons), and

illustrate the negative impact of muscle artifacts (notably facial or neck muscles) or ocular artifacts (i.e. blinks or eyes
movements) that are concurrently recorded with EEG sensors. Such artifacts can pollute EEG signals and are one of
the main confounding factors in EEG experiments.
Later on, we will initiate the audience to real-time EEG processing, analysis and visualization with OpenViBE (http:
//openvibe.inria.fr). OpenViBE is a free and open-source software platform for the design, evaluation and use of realtime BCI systems [5]. It can enable anyone to design their
own BCI without writing a single line of code, simply by visually assembling boxes representing different EEG processing modules. As such, OpenViBE has been used all
over the world by hobbyist, neuroscientists, artists, teachers, engineers or psychologists (and many others). We
already organized two OpenViBE workshops during international conferences (International BCI conference 2014,
International BCI meeting 2016).
During this session, we will show the audience how to visualize EEG signals in real-time, how to filter and process
them, and how to design a very simple and basic BCI to detect eye opening or closing, or left-hand, right-hand or foot
movement (both real and imagined movements). The easeof-use of OpenViBE indeed enables the audience to realize
such BCI in about an hour only.

infer users’ mental states while
they undergo regular interactions,
e.g. monitor workload and attention
continuously in [2].

Third session: Discussion about BCI capabilities, pitfalls and
related ethical considerations
As BCIs bring new interaction possibilities, they are sometimes associated with science fiction stories. This results in
a wide media coverage as well as in strong reactions from
the population, ranging from fear to be controlled/manipulated
to extreme hope for patients to recover their impaired functions. To confront and possibly prevent this, researchers
who develop and use BCIs have to be utterly aware of BCI

real capabilities, of their pitfalls as well as of BCI-related
ethical considerations [3]. In this way only, we will be able
to lead useful research and to communicate properly about
BCIs with the general public and patients. For this reason,
in this third session, we will propose discussions aiming to
guide participants to understand (1) real phenomena underlying BCI systems, (2) our boundaries and ethical responsibilities, leading to correct behaviour with end-users and
the media. More specifically, we will propose group work on
different themes, as follows:
• Brain activity recordings: choice of sensors - invasive
or not, and their application. Principle of balance on
risk ratio
• Cost of BCIs: BCI applications should be affordable
by their end-users. Principle of accessibility.
• BCI enabling control: if a problem occurs while a patient is controlling a wheelchair using BCI, who is responsible? The patient, the engineer who conceived
the BCI or the company who built the wheelchair?
Principle of responsability.
• Experiments with patients: how should BCIs be presented to patients? How far should the experiment
be described to them and their surroundings? Principle of informed consent form & management of the
generated hope.
For each of these themes, participants will be provided with
different documents which would stimulate discussions, e.g.
scientific articles, newspaper articles, testimonies, videos.
They will also be provided with a set of questions, hopefully inspiring/engaging them to form opinions. At the end of
the session, each group will present their conclusions and
discuss/argue with the other participants.

Intended Audience
The content of the course is suitable for students, industrials and researchers that are beginners in BCI research
and use. People already familiar with BCI may nonetheless
benefit from session 2 and 3 if they want to learn about the
OpenViBE platform or reevaluate their practice.
Prerequisites: None.
Resources: Samples of course slides made by the authors
for other courses are provided as additional material.
