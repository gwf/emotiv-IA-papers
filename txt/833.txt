Tests of attention restoration theory (ART) consistently support that exposure to
restorative environments can replenish finite cognitive resources needed to focus
attention. These environments are usually natural, as opposed to human made, but
dimensions of naturalness and restorativeness are not one and the same, and yet have not
been empirically delineated. That stated, the restorative effect has been documented in
children and adults. However, neuroscientists have barely begun to test for neural
correlates of ART. In this dissertation, I employ electroencephalography (EEG) to record
electrophysiological brain activity during an active visual oddball task to capture and
analyze p3 elicitation and late positive potential (LPP) activation, event-related potential
(ERP) components. The p3 component is a positive-going peak in brain activity
occurring in the window between 200 and 600 milliseconds after the onset of a stimulus.
Previous research has shown that the amplitude of the p3 potential is attenuated – and
latency increased – when task difficulty is high and/or attentional resources are depleted.

iv
Conversely, when task demands are low, p3 amplitude is greater without an
accompanying increase in latency, suggesting cognitive efficiency. LPP is positive
activity from 500 ms or more after stimulus onset until stimulus termination that is
associated with stimulus emotional valence. I hypothesized that, in an active
discrimination oddball task, using a within-subjects design, adults would show increased
p3 amplitude for low-frequency target images occurring amidst standard (highfrequency) images of highly restorative environments (HR; Condition 1) versus when
standard images are of lowly restorative environments (LR; Condition 2) or a solid brown
tile (Br; Condition 3), and that naturalness would not interact with restorativeness such
that targets amidst restorative natural environments elicit p3’s that are no stronger than
targets amidst restorative built environments. This is because 1) restorative scenes should
increase attentional resources, resulting in greater efficiency, even though task difficulty
is unchanging between conditions, and 2) naturalness is separate from restorativeness and
should not affect attention when restorativeness is controlled. Results showed p3
amplitude was greater, and latency earlier, for HR standard stimuli, rather than targets,
which was unusual for the oddball paradigm but is explained within the framework of
ART according to standard stimulus content. Also, LPP activity was only different
between one occipital channel and three frontal channels between 600 ms and 1000 ms
post stimulus onset, but greater in the nature stimulus group than the built between 1000
ms and 2000 ms post stimulus onset. This finding is consistent with previous research
and interpreted to mean that natural stimuli are more pleasant and arousing than built
stimuli. Limitations and future directions are also discussed.

PUBLIC ABSTRACT

Modulation of p3 and the Late Positive Potential ERP Components by Standard Stimulus
Restorativeness and Naturalness
Salif Mahamane
Tests of attention restoration theory (ART) consistently support that exposure to
restorative environments can replenish finite cognitive resources, needed to focus
attention, from a depleted state. These environments are usually natural, but the
dimensions of naturalness and restorativeness are not one and the same, and yet have not
been empirically delineated. The restorative effect has been documented in children and
adults. However, neuroscientists have barely begun to test for neural correlates of ART.
In this dissertation, I employ electroencephalography (EEG) to record
electrophysiological brain activity during an active visual oddball task to capture and
analyze p3 elicitation and late positive potential (LPP) activation, event-related potential
(ERP) components. The p3 component is a pronounced, positive-going potential in brain
activity occurring in the window between 200 and 600 milliseconds after the onset of a
stimulus. Previous research has shown that the amplitude of the p3 potential is attenuated
– and latency increased – when task difficulty is high and/or attentional resources are
depleted. Conversely, when task demands are low, p3 amplitude is greater without an
accompanying increase in latency, suggesting cognitive efficiency. LPP is positive
activity from 500 ms or more after stimulus onset until stimulus termination that is
associated with stimulus emotional valence. I hypothesized that, in an active
discrimination oddball task adults would show increased p3 amplitude for low-frequency

vi
target images occurring amidst standard (high-frequency) images of highly restorative
environments versus when standard images are of lowly restorative environments or a
solid brown tile, and that naturalness would not interact with restorativeness such that
targets amidst restorative natural environments elicit p3’s that are no stronger than targets
amidst restorative built environments. Results showed p3 amplitude was greater, and
latency earlier, for HR standard stimuli, rather than targets, which was unusual for the
oddball paradigm but is explained within the framework of ART according to standard
stimulus content. Also, LPP activity was only different between one occipital channel and
three frontal channels between 600 ms and 1000 ms post stimulus onset, but greater in the
nature stimulus group than the built between 1000 ms and 2000 ms post stimulus onset.
This finding is consistent with previous research and interpreted to mean that natural
stimuli are more pleasant and arousing than built stimuli. Limitations and future
directions are also discussed.

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
An effect of natural scenery, versus built (i.e. urban, humanmade), as restoring
and/or improving performance on tasks requiring sustained focus has been shown in
neurotypical (presumed or confirmed) adults (Berman, Jonides, & Kaplan, 2008; Berto,
2005; Hartmann & Apaolaza, 2013; Lee, Williams, Sargent, Williams, & Johnson, 2015;
Mayer, Frantz, Bruehlman-Senecal, Dolliver, 2009; Tennessen & Cimprich, 1995),
children (Berto, Pasini, & Barbiero, 2015), and elderly people (Gamble, Howard, &
Howard, 2014; Ottoson & Grahn, 2005). This effect is not only robust in that it has been
well replicated, but also in that it has been shown in children with AttentionDeficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; Kuo & Taylor, 2004; Taylor & Kuo, 2009, 2011;
van den Berg & van den Berg, 2011).
Kaplan and Kaplan (1989), and Kaplan (1995), set the framework for this line of
research by introducing attention restoration theory (ART). The theory explains that, as a
function of several qualitative components, environments will be more or less restorative
of depleted attentional resources. They postulated that natural environments would be
higher in this restorativeness than built environments. Perceived restorativeness, as
assessed by the Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS; Hartig, Korpela, Evans, &
Gärling, 1997) or its short version (PRS-short; Berto, 2005), is the degree to which
participants subjectively rate an environmental stimulus as likely to be restorative based
on their perceptions of it possessing the aforementioned components (described below).
To date, only a few studies have used neuroscience and psychophysiology to
investigate functional neural correlates of attention restoration. They used

2
electroencephalography (EEG) to specifically identify neural correlates of affect
differences in natural versus built environments, finding that green spaces lower
frustration, engagement, and arousal with greater “meditation” (Aspinall, Mavros, Coyne,
& Roe, 2011; Roe, Aspinall, Mavros, & Coyne, 2011). However, these studies had
limitations with respect to instrumentation in that the researchers did not have access to
raw data and so were confined to less rigorous data pre-processing techniques than are
standard for EEG. Thus, their interpretations are restrictedly inconclusive.
Chang, Hammitt, Chen, Machnik, and Su (2008) explored alpha brainwave
activity (with EEG), as well as facial electromyographic (EMG; facial muscle tension
which is reflective of emotional and mental stress) and blood volume pulse (BVP)
responses, during 10-second exposures to 12 environmental images which were
hypothetically selected to be particularly high on one of the four restorative components
(two components, ‘extent’ and ‘coherence’ were combined; component description
below) compared to a “non-viewing” solid blue control image presented for 10 s between
slides. Generally, they found greater alpha brainwave power in left and right hemispheres
in all component-particular image conditions compared to the non-viewing image. The
other physiological measures also indicated an improved state while viewing all the
component-particular image categories compared to a non-viewing condition.
These findings are informative with respect to psychophysiological correlates of
attention restoration. However, there are some limitations to interpretation such as a lack
of any other scene category than natural, no correlations between dependent measures
being reported, and blue having since been shown to induce positive emotions in a

3
Chinese sample (Wang, Shu, & Mo, 2014). Addressing such limitations to drawing
conclusions must be a priority for future investigations.
One other study recorded EEG data while participants viewed fractals that fell
into two categories, exact and statistical, which corresponded characteristically to
manmade and natural scenes, respectively. Exact fractals are those in which all elements
recur at exactly the same rate. Statistical fractals are patterns within which elements have
certain probabilities of recurring. In nature, fractal patterns are statistical, such as the
branching pattern in trees (Hägerhäll, Laike, Küller, Marcheschi, Boydston, & Taylor,
2015). They found that alpha band (8-15Hz, associated with relaxed alertness and
meditative states; Aspinall et al., 2013) power increased as the fractals gradually
transitioned from exact to statistical types; suggestive of an attention restoration effect
(Hägerhäll et al., 2015). Schertz, Kardan, and Berman (2020) found that viewing images
from which overt semantic information had been removed, but which still contained lowlevel visual information (i.e. scrambled edges) evoked similar thoughts as the images
retaining semantic content. Fractalness is also low-level visual information. These
findings are promising for further exploration of frequency band as indicative of
cognitive load within different environments. But, there lacks a more technical
examination of attention restoration’s neural correlates that can be done using eventrelated potential (ERP) methodology. The study reported herein used a sample of
neurotypical adults to expand on initial work our group has done with respect to such an
examination.
Using fMRI, Tang and colleagues (2017) found that natural scenes, which their
participants rated as most restorative compared to urban, were responded to with greatest

4
activity in visual and attentional focus associated brain areas. Specifically, activity in the
left and right cuneus different when comparing urban versus mountain and urban versus
water landscapes. Further, in the urban versus water landscape comparison, the right
cingulate gyrus and the left precuneus were activated. These structures are part of an area
significantly involved in the focusing of attention.
Natural scenery has also been found to have a recovery effect from stress. Ulrich
and colleagues (1991) conducted a study of 120 participants in which they watched a
stressful film and then were exposed to a video of either natural or urban scenery. Using
the dependent physiological measures of heart period, muscle tension, skin conductance,
and pulse transit time, they found that, across these measures, stress recovery was faster
after watching the natural scenery compared to the urban scenery. They interpreted these
findings from a psycho-evolutionary perspective in that natural scenery facilitating a
return to positive emotional states and positive physiological changes would be
accompanied by improved sustained attention.
Attention Restoration Theory
The premise behind ART is that restorative environments engage involuntary
(exogenous) attention – that which is attracted by stimuli in one’s environment in a
bottom-up fashion (James, 1892). This engagement affords the effortful, distractioninhibiting mechanisms of voluntary (endogenous, directed) attention – that which is
controlled in a top-down fashion according to immediate, task-relevant goals (James,
1892) – an opportunity to rest (Kaplan & Kaplan, 1989; Kaplan, 1995). This idea hinges
upon the well supported hypothesis that voluntary attention relies upon finite cognitive
resources that inevitably deplete, resulting in directed attention fatigue (DAF). It was

5
foundationally tested by a paradigm in which adults’ attention was taxed by the Sustained
Attention to Response Task (SART; Robertson, Manly, Andrade, Baddeley, & Yiend,
1997) prior to a slideshow of either natural (collectively rated as significantly more
restorative) or built scenery, or geometric patterns, before performance on the SART was
measured a second time (Berto, 2005). The SART is a lengthy, mundane go/no-go task in
which participants must withhold response in the case of a rare stimulus that is similar to
all other task stimuli. The finding was that after a nature-scene slideshow, performance
on the SART had improved at post-test from pre-test. But, after a built-scene or
geometric pattern slideshow, this was not the case.
Restorative Components
High restorativeness comprises high levels across five componential psychoenvironmental characteristics as outlined by Kaplan and Kaplan (1989) and Kaplan
(1995). These are fascination, extent, coherence, being away, and compatibility. In some
studies, extent and coherence have been assessed as one component. Herzog, Maguire,
and Nebel (2003) assessed the prediction of perceived restorative potential (PRP) by
ratings of each of the components (combining extent and coherence as one component).
Regression analyses found significant prediction of PRP by being away and
compatibility. Further, Felsten (2009) found that perceived restorativeness scores,
computed by averaging ratings of campus scenes with varying views of nature across the
same four components used by Herzog and colleagues (2003), were correlated strongly
(r’s ≥ .88) with a single-item measure of overall perceived restorativeness.
‘Fascination’ refers to an environment’s ability to capture involuntary attention.
Fascination is further separated into ‘soft’ fascination and ‘hard’ fascination (Kaplan,

6
1995). Though both involve the bottom-up engagement of involuntary attention, they
differ as a function of the resulting cognitive load. That is, hard fascination (e.g.,
watching auto racing or television) occupies working memory more completely, leaving
little room for reflection, while soft fascination occupies working memory partly and thus
allows for the processing of lingering, unresolved thoughts without a drain on attentional
resources (Basu, Duvall, & Kaplan, 2018; Kaplan, 1995). In fact, evidence has been
shown that a walk in nature specifically engages soft fascination (Basu et al., 2018).
‘Extent’ refers to the environment offering sufficient perspective such that the
attention it attracts is maintained for a time long enough that restoration may occur. If the
environment’s engagement of exogenous attention is fleeting, restoration cannot take
place sufficiently (Kaplan, 1995). That is, environments low on extent do not engage
exogenous attention long enough for endogenous mechanisms to recover.
‘Coherence’ refers to the environment’s semantic holism. In the past, it has been
combined with Extent with the idea that an environment making sense in an holistic,
Gestalt fashion, can be continuously visually explored more naturally. Conversely, if an
environment is visually or otherwise incohesive, endogenous attention is likely to become
engaged in effortfully attempting to make sense of it, further taxing attentional resources
(Kaplan, 1995).
Being away’ is the degree to which the environment is conceptually and/or
physically distinct from the one in which fatigue was induced. That is, as long as being
away from the fatiguing environment is experienced by the subject, restoration can take
place (Kaplan, 1995). For example, physically, someone may leave the context of their
resource-demanding task and take a break in a different place. Or, conceptually, someone

7
may close the application on their computer they are using for work, and open one for
entertainment or relaxation on the same computer, in the same environment.
And lastly, ‘compatibility’ is the degree to which a potentially restorative
environment is suited for an individual’s restoration goals. Simply put, an environment
must be compatible with the activities a person associates with restoration (Kaplan,
1995). For example, a person who enjoys relaxing in natural environments may not find
an urban coffee shop or museum to be very restorative.
The PRS was designed to assess the restorativeness of environments (or their
virtual representations) as rated by participants. The scale was originally developed with
17 items representing four components, conceptually lumping coherence and extent.
Berto (2005) adapted a short version consisting of five items (one for each component,
separating coherence and extent; PRS-short), to facilitate collecting ratings on a larger set
of stimuli (e.g., 20 environmental photos).
For instance, in selecting stimuli to test ART, Berto (2005) sourced 100 scenic
color images of built and natural environments from “magazines and existing stimulus
materials” (pg. 251). The images were divided into 5 subsets of 20 and rated by 8
participants per subset using the PRS-short. The images were described as “representing
lakes, rivers, seas, hills, woods, orchards, forests, city riversides, city streets, industrial
zones, housing, porches, urban areas, and skyscrapers” (pg. 251). Though Kaplan and
Kaplan (1989) theorized that natural environments would be most likely to highly
comprise the 5 restorative components, they did not explicate that all natural
environments should be highly restorative or that all restorative environments should be
natural; nor were such requirements, following consistently, for built and low restorative

8
environments. However, having set cutoffs on the 0-10 scale for high perceived
restorativeness (≥ 6.5) and low perceived restorativeness (≤ 3), Berto’s (2005) ratings
showed all of the images in the high restorative range to be natural and all of the images
in the low restorative range to be built.
In further replications, significantly greater perceived restorativeness of natural
over built environments has been shown via ratings, by adults (Berman et al., 2008;
Berto, 2007; Lee et al., 2015) and children (Berto et al., 2015), and experimentally,
showing improved attentional performance after nature-environment exposure in adults
(Berman et al., 2008; Gamble et al., 2014; Hartmann & Apaolaza, 2013; Lee et al., 2015;
Mayer et al., 2009; Ottoson & Grahn, 2007; Tennessen & Cimprich, 1995) and children
(Berto et al., 2015). However, beyond Berto’s (2005) initial assessment, the studies that
used ratings only did so as a manipulation check for natural and built environmental
stimuli that had already been selected. Thus, it had only been initially tested (using
images subjectively selected by the researcher for their likelihood to be restorative)
whether naturalness is inherently restorative, or these dimensions are separate.
However, images in a larger stimulus set (418 images), initially sourced by crowd
solicitation via social media, have been categorized as nature or built and rated on the
PRS-short for use in a study that tested for implicit discrimination between natural and
built images using ERPs (Mahamane et al., 2020). Within this set, there was a significant
positive correlation between naturalness and restorativeness (r = .376, p < .001),
suggesting that while these characteristics co-vary, they also vary independently.
Recent Reviews

9
Berto (2014) published a review of literature addressing the effects of exposure to
nature in aiding recovery from stress (Stress Reduction Theory; SRT) and mental fatigue
(ART). Her synthesis of the literature highlights a clear pattern across multiple paradigms
supporting both SRT and ART. She pulls from physiological (e.g., electromyography,
skin conductance, and cardiac response), behavioral (discipline, concentration, and
delayed gratification), and neurological (EEG and fMRI) findings that consistently
suggest decreased stress, improved self-regulation, greater alpha frequency power, and
greater activity in the anterior cingulate and the insula – brain areas associated with
empathy and altruism – for people who were exposed to real or virtual natural
environments. She concludes by pointing out that several questions must still be
addressed. For example, considering adaptation theory, that people grow accustomed to
their environments, do people who live surrounded by nature require greater exposure to
experience the benefits of stress reduction and attention restoration? Longitudinal studies
should be employed to address this question.
A systematic review by Ohly and colleagues (2016) included 31 studies that met
the following requirements: a) were natural experiments, randomized investigations, or
pre-post measurements; b) compared natural and non-natural/other settings; and c) used
objective measures of attention. The question guiding their review was, “What is the
relative attention restoration potential of natural settings compared to other settings?”
They pooled effect estimates across investigations and compared attention outcomes at
“post” measurements between groups exposed to natural settings and groups exposed to
non-natural settings. Eleven objective measures of attention were represented throughout
the studies included in the meta-analysis. Of these, the only measures that showed

10
improvement for groups exposed to nature were the digit span forward, digit span
backward, and the trail-making task (B version). All three of these tasks are demanding
of working memory. These results led the researchers to mixed conclusions. While the
three tests showing significant group differences across studies all relied on working
memory, other tests of working memory did not show differences. Also, digit span
backward is more demanding than digit span forward. The researchers acknowledged that
a limitation of their review was the heterogeneity of stimuli, methodology, and tasks
across the studies. In fact, multiple tasks represented were only actually employed by 2 of
the studies included in the meta-analysis. They call for the ART community to establish
consensus regarding which measures of directed attention should measure attention
restoration most appropriately, and then use these measures consistently across studies.
In response, Stevenson, Schilhab, and Bentsen (2018) published a follow-up
systematic review to Ohly and colleagues’ (2016) describing their attempt to find relevant
cognitive measures of elements of directed attention specifically sensitive to the
restoration effect. They conducted a search for peer reviewed research articles that were
published since July 2013, when Ohly and colleagues (2016) conducted their search.
Further, articles had to meet the following requirements: a) were experimental in nature;
b) used a natural environment or natural stimuli; c) included an acceptable control or
comparison environment; d) included objective outcome measures that derived from
standardized cognitive tasks. The search was not limited by participant demographics,
nor country, culture, or the presence of water in the environmental stimuli. This search
resulted in 46 separate studies, from 42 publications, which were included in their
systematic review.

11
The systematic review revealed that the majority of the studies were conducted in
western countries (Europe, 43.5%; North America, 32.6%; Australia, 2.2%; New
Zealand, 2.2%; and Asia, 19.5%). The youngest sample had a mean age of 4.53 years and
the oldest 69.1 years. 54.3% of the studies used real physical exposure to the
environmental conditions and 45.7% used virtual exposure, such as photographs. In the
real-environment exposure category, some participants were instructed to engage more
actively (e.g., hiking, cycling) and some were instructed to engage more passively (e.g.,
viewing natural environments). Virtual exposure was used 55.3% of the time in
randomized-controlled trials, with the remainder of those trials being real-environmental
exposure. Only three studies were included that were quasi-experimental in which
environmental exposure was unable to be randomized. One of the virtual exposure
studies investigated sound, rather than visual stimuli. In three virtual exposure studies,
stimuli were supplemented by imagining being in the environment or mindfulness
meditation. Exposure duration ranged from 40 s – 3 hrs for single exposure designs, and
up to several weeks for a series of exposures. In the quasi-experimental studies, durations
ranged from 6 days to several years.
In determining the cognitive domains most sensitive to environmentally driven
restoration effects, studies from Ohly and colleagues’ (2016) review that reported
baseline measures of cognitive performance were then included by Stevenson and
colleagues (2018) for their cognitive performance meta-analysis. They reported results in
eight sections according to the cognitive domains assessed by the outcome measures
represented in their review: working memory, attentional control, vigilance, cognitive
flexibility, impulse control, processing speed, “and other emerging domains”, which were

12
the Delay of Gratification Task, Taylor’s Aggression Paradigm, and the Graduate Record
Exam (GRE). These last three assessments were each the only ones in the review in their
respective domains. As such, meta-analyses across multiple studies of those domains
were not possible. Across all levels of baseline balance, the researchers found
improvement in working memory, attentional control, and cognitive flexibility following
exposure to natural environments, with low to moderate effect sizes. However, the effect
on attentional control was not detected when only studies with fully balanced baseline
measures were used. It is of note that actual exposures showed to enhance the restoration
effect compared to virtual exposures, but the studies with natural exposures typically had
longer exposure durations as well, so that particular finding is inconclusive. The authors
conclude by arguing that directed attention as a construct, and the restoration effect, need
to be updated for future research based on these results taken in hand with Ohly and
colleagues’ (2016) results. Finally, the authors acknowledge that, while each domain that
showed an effect by nature exposure requires directed attention to maintain focus on taskrelevant stimuli and inhibit attention to task-irrelevant stimuli, we cannot know from
these reviews how much is recruited for each domain compared to the others.
These recent reviews of research on ART have been valuable in illuminating a
more precise direction for this area of work to pursue. In taking on the task of collecting
and recruiting studies of a theory in which the relevant constructs have not been
operationalized consistently well, and the paradigmatic approaches have been wide and
varied, these review authors have made significant headway toward a more robust
framework by revealing consistencies in which cognitive domains are sensitive to these

13
restoration effects. For example, even in concluding their review, Stevenson and
colleagues (2018) provided clearer construct tenets of directed attention.
EEG and ERP’s
EEG uses electrodes (channels) placed directly on the scalp to record
electrophysiological activity in cortical regions of the brain. Data collected via EEG is
commonly used in two types of analyses: spectral, which assesses the power of different
neuro-electric frequency bands under experimentally manipulated conditions, and time
series, which analyzes mean electrophysiological characteristics (i.e., amplitude and
latency) of cortical activity following specific events (stimuli). These time-locked
samples of activation corresponding to events are ERP’s. Thus, an ERP is the activation
signature seen from stimulus onset to a theoretical or precedential end time point,
depending on the variables being investigated. ERP components are well-documented
recurring ERP features that are empirically supported as corresponding to various
cognitive and/or affective processes. The study reported herein focused solely on ERP
analyses with respect to EEG data.
Components of Interest
The p3. The p3 ERP component is the highest positive-going wave peak
occurring 270-500 ms after stimulus onset and has shown to be an index of stimulus
discrimination and attentional resource allocation (Polich, 2007). The p3 is traditionally
elicited using variations of the oddball paradigm: repetitions of an infrequent stimulus
occurring randomly (or pseudo-randomly) among repetitions of a frequent stimulus.
Participants can be instructed to respond, either mentally (e.g., “count the number of
(targets)”) or behaviorally (e.g., “press the button whenever you see a (target)”), so that

14
stimulus processing is active, or to not respond (e.g., “please view the images on the
screen”) so that stimulus processing is passive.
The p3 originates in frontal- and parietal-central locations, reaching maximum
strength in parietal regions (Polich, 2007). p3 peak amplitude – the highest amplitude in
the post-stimulus latency window relative to the immediately pre-stimulus baseline
activation average – is greater and earlier when active task demands are low and more
attentional resources are available for recruitment. Polich (2007) explains that arousal
level dictates the available amount of such finite resources. When task demands are high,
peak amplitude is lesser and later. But, in the case of increased cognitive efficiency,
amplitude may decrease without an increase in peak latency (Pfueller et al., 2011). And,
generally, amplitude is usually lower for passive than active tasks due to extraneous nontask events recruiting resources away from task stimuli (Bennington & Polich, 1999).
In sum, elicitations of the p3 ERP component under restorative stimulus
conditions may reflect attention restoration. However, there is a missing link between
ART and the model of p3 elicitation described by Polich (2007). The attentional
resources Polich refers to are analogous to those underlying Kaplan and Kaplan’s (1989)
directed attention. However, ART does not account for arousal. And, Roe and colleagues
(2013) found built scenes – usually found to be less restorative than nature – as
associated with the “arousal” EEG component of their instrument and nature to decrease
arousal. Again, given limited access to raw data, their results are inconclusive. Further
work is needed to evaluate whether this inter-theory disconnect is simply reflective of
non-communication between areas of research or an actual deficiency of one of the
theories to account for conditional fluctuations in attentional resources. Expectedly, some

15
relationship between attention restoration and arousal exists and could be revealed by
incorporating restorative stimuli into a p3 oddball task could elucidate some of this
ambiguity.
Late Positive Potential (LPP). The LPP is a positive-going ERP component in
the window from at least 400 ms post stimulus onset until stimulus offset which is
indicative of sustained attention to affective stimuli (Cuthbert, Schupp, Bradley,
Birbaumer, & Lang, 2000; Foti, Hajcak, & Dien, 2009; Hajcak, MacNamara, & Olvet,
2010; Hajcak & Olvet, 2008; MacNamara, Ferri, & Hajcak, 2011; Schupp, Junghöfer,
Weike, & Hamm, 2003). It is maximal over centro-parietal areas and thought to be an
index of prolonged stimulus processing following the p3 peak. Specifically, greater LPP
amplitude is associated with processing emotionally valent (positive or negative), versus
neutral, stimuli. Based on an extensive body of converging evidence that dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; associated with working memory recruitment) activity
attenuates limbic system activity in response to emotional stimuli, MacNamara and
colleagues (2011) showed that LPP amplitude, is greater in response to aversive versus
neutral stimuli, and under low versus high cognitive load.
Relationship between p3 and LPP. A recent review addressed questions about
the relationship of p3 and LPP. More specifically than arousal, Hajcak and Foti (2020)
argue that LPP is activation is modulated by the motivational significance of a stimulus to
survival, evolutionarily speaking, or a task at hand. That is, as previously described,
stimuli that we have either a negative or positive response toward show strong LPP
activation compared to neutral stimuli. The authors argue that such negative or positive
stimulus valence evokes avoidance or approach behavioral responses. Further, it has been

16
found that oddball paradigms with longer stimulus presentation durations (e.g., 1000 ms)
elicit more drawn out p3’s that remind of LPP’s elicited in emotional viewing tasks.
However, oddball paradigms with brief stimulus presentation durations (e.g., 200 ms)
elicit more typical p3’s (Gable & Adams, 2013).
Previous ERP Research in Environmental Cognition
A study by Rousselet, Thorpe, and Fabre-Thorpe (2004) was conducted to push
the visual system to its limits by instructing participants to note whether any of 1, 2, or 4
nature scenes, presented simultaneously for only 26ms, contained one or more animals.
Following stimulus offset, participants would have 1000 ms to raise their finger from a
pressure pad to indicate they had seen an animal. If after 1000 ms they did not raise their
finger, their response was recorded as a no-go response. EEG data were recorded during
the task and the ERPs following each stimulus presentation were analyzed.
Behaviorally, they found a main effect of the number of images to process on
mean accuracy, with the greatest accuracy during 1 image compared to 2 or 4 and greater
accuracy with 2 images than 4. A parallel main effect was found for response time with
all pairwise comparisons being significant below the .05 level where 1-image
presentations were responded to the fastest, then 2-, and then 4-. Electrophysiologically,
though they did not analyze the p3 and LPP components, they found that the initial
occipital amplitude was no different between target trials (animal present) and distractor
trials (animal not present) for the 1- and 2-stimulus conditions. However, for the 4stimulus presentations, there was a clear difference in amplitude between target and
distractor trials. Amplitude latency, however, was longer in the 1-stimulus condition than
in the 2-. But, the longest was still in the 4-stimulus condition. All of these results, taken

17
together, indicate much greater difficulty in processing 4 scenes simultaneously than 1.
The relevance of this study to the present study is its use of nature scenic photographs as
stimuli for ERP research. Scenic stimuli are more complex than most conventional p3
stimuli that are often simple shapes or tones. In the present study, the scenes were not
categorized so specifically for a particular constituent, such as an animal, but simply for
whether it is a scenic image or a geometric pattern. Based on these findings, it was not of
concern that the present study’s task or stimuli difficulty would disrupt the investigation
of interest.
Vogt, Herpers, Scherfgen, Strüder, and Schneider (2014) had 22 participants both
moderately cycle and rest passively (on the bike while “driven” through a virtual
environment; VE) in each three different city street VE conditions (none, front screen
only, and surround) that each foster a different sense of presence. Condition order was
randomized within participant and each condition lasted 5 minutes. To assess cognitive
performance, participants were presented on the front screen of the VE with randomly
ordered, equal difficulty math problems. They responded with buttons near their hands on
the handlebars. Each response placed a marker in the EEG data time course
corresponding to the moment it occurred during EEG recording.
Vogt and colleagues (2014) found no significant difference across conditions in
cognitive performance on the math task. Electrophysiologically, they found an interaction
effect of VE and regions of interest (ROI) such that amplitude of the N200 ERP
component (219.50 ms post stimulus onset ± 30.27ms) increased in frontal, parietal, and
occipital ROI from control to surround VE conditions. N200 amplitude at central ROI
were not modulated by VE. N200 latencies at frontal and occipital ROI increased from

18
control to surround. Regarding the p3 component (318.50 ms post stimulus onset ±
46.76ms), a VE x ROI interaction showed that amplitude increased at frontal, central,
occipital, and parietal ROI from control to surround. p3 latencies decreased from front
VE to surround at central ROI and from control VE to front at parietal ROI. They did not
find exercise to benefit cognitive performance over rest but did contribute to the sense of
presence in the VE and thus increased cognitive load. The authors concluded that the
neuroelectric differences found could be adaptations to compensate with neuronal
resources to avoid performance impairment in VE. Of course, the study only uses a city
street VE and control without a natural scene VE as their aim was primarily the effect of
exercise in a VE environment on cognitive performance. Real world natural and built
environmental conditions have been tested with mild exercise (i.e. walking) and shown a
benefit of natural compared to built environments (Berman et al., 2008).
Li, Zhou, Kong, and Guo (2020) had participants complete an active-response
oddball task before and after a virtual ART program delivered via a virtual reality headmounted display (VR-HMD). There were two types of instructions for the virtual reality
experience, one was called “ST-ART” in which participants could move their limbs and
torso to more easily engage with the VE. The other was “CL-ART” in which they had to
remain still. By recording EEG during both types of VE tasks, the researchers could
control for the negative impacts of movement on EEG. They found that participants’ p3
latency to target stimuli was shorter in the post CL-ART oddball task than the pre-. Also,
the RT difference from oddball Time 1 to Time 2 was positively correlated with p3
latency as well. These results suggest greater attentional capacity following a virtual

19
attention restoration intervention. However, the authors do not report statistical analyses
of p3 amplitude, or any metrics associated with LPP.
Finally, an initial study of nature/built implicit discrimination assessed by P3
elicitation used a passive, two-stimulus oddball paradigm and focused on the p3 and LPP
components (Mahamane et al., 2020). The task was a within-subjects design such that
sixty neurotypical participants viewed 100 one-second, randomly ordered scene
presentations in each of two trial blocks that were in counterbalanced order across
participants. In one block, nature images were standard (f = 80) and built images were
rare (f = 20), with these roles then being reversed in the other block. Because nature
stimuli had been rated as significantly more restorative compared to built (t(387) = 7.496,
p < .001, d = .79) using the PRS-short, it was hypothesized that when nature images were
standard, and built images were targets, p3 peak amplitude would be greater and earlier,
suggesting improved attention via restoration in this condition, than when built images
were standard with nature targets. That is, the standard photo category was expected to
affect p3 signal strength and latency during target trials – which consisted of the opposite
category. It was also hypothesized that average LPP amplitude for targets would be
greater in the nature-standard condition versus the built-standard condition as attention
restoration should be a pleasant experience.
Mahamane and colleagues (2020) operationalized p3 as the average activation,
compared to pre-stimulus baseline, between 200 ms and 400 ms post stimulus onset
(driven by Polich, 2008). Findings revealed that p3 amplitude for oddball stimuli was
significantly higher than standard stimuli (t(59) = 2.882 p = .006, d = .372) within the
nature-standard condition; but not within the built-standard condition (t(59) = 1.699, p =

20
.094, d = .219). No p3 amplitude differences emerged for targets between conditions.
This finding was interpreted as implicit discrimination. However, the stimuli were
permissively included based on data from a scene categorization task such that any
images categorized as “nature” by 60% or more of the 51 participants were included in
the experiment as nature stimuli, and images categorized as “nature” by 40% or less were
included as “built” stimuli. This may have resulted in too much diversity in the stimuli
with respect to naturalness, weakening p3 amplitude, and thus masking a stronger
discrimination effect or between-block target differences.
Regarding the LPP, this was defined as the mean amplitude in the window from
550 ms to 930 ms post stimulus onset (driven by MacNamara et al., 2011). Mahamane
and colleagues (2020) found that LPP average amplitude for oddball scenes, when nature
scenes were standard, was lower than that for oddballs when built were standard with,
albeit, a small effect size (t(59) = 2.069, p = .043, d = .267). While perceived
restorativeness was assessed for the stimuli prior to the study’s conceptualization,
emotional valence was not. However, Roe and colleagues (2013) found that, across a
large photo set, nature images were rated as significantly more positively valent than
urban images, which were essentially rated as neutral. Based on this finding, it could be
that Mahamane and colleagues’ (2020) finding is due to greater positive valence of nature
versus built images regardless of standard versus oddball status within the paradigm.
Thus, there are several methodological areas of this previous investigation upon which
the present study intends to improve. Nonetheless, the fact that a significant and
marginally significant difference was seen between standard stimuli and oddballs within

21
each condition, even with these limitations, suggests that the sample still implicitly
differentiated these categories.
Stricter inclusion criteria for scene stimuli should be used to create more
divergent stimulus sets with respect to naturalness. With the loose categorization
thresholds used previously, many photos were included in each category that visibly
contained elements of the other (e.g., a row of resort condominiums along a beach front
classified as “nature”). Stimuli should also be included to represent restorativeness
extremes irrespective of naturalness, given that these dimensions are not perfectly
correlated.
Another change, to investigate the effect of scene characteristics on p3 as an index
of attentional resources, would be the use of neutral – that is, non-scene – visual stimuli
as oddballs instead of using scenes from the opposite category (e.g., a geo-pattern image,
instead of a built scene, when nature scenes are standard). While Mahamane and
colleagues (2020) found p3 amplitude difference between oddball and standard images in
the nature condition, the effect may have been weakened by standard and oddball images
both belonging to an overall “scene” category and thus oddballs less perceived as
“oddballs”. Conversely, because standard stimuli were each different individual images
within their respective categories, they could be experienced as distinct from one another
even while belonging to the same scene category; potentially increasing p3 signal
strength for standard stimuli as well. Both issues, along with loose naturalness category
inclusion thresholds, likely contributed to a much less dichotomous distinction between
standard and target stimuli. It must be noted that this methodology represents an open
question in p3 research: can multiple category exemplars serve as standard stimuli

22
representing one standard category vs. an oddball category that also comprises multiple
exemplars? Traditional p3 methods use one stimulus as the standard and another single
stimulus as the target to test how paradigm characteristics (e.g., inter-stimulus interval
(ISI) duration).
Also, an active task, producing greater p3 amplitudes, should more visibly show
modulation without hitting a floor as well as index attention (as required for task
performance) rather than novelty. Bennington and Polich (1999) showed that in a visual
two-stimulus oddball task, p3 amplitudes in a passive paradigm were much smaller than
in the same task when participants were instructed to respond to oddballs (active
paradigm).
In this study, the researchers also employed a much more controlled oddball task
in which target frequency was even lower than the precedent of 20% and sequence
position relative to standard stimuli was controlled (Lammers & Badia, 1989; Polich,
1989). Specifically, stimuli were distributed into twenty 10-trial sequences such that the
first six images were always the standard stimulus and one of the last four was the target.
Across the 20 sequences, the target would appear 5 times each in the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th
position of the sequence, albeit in random order. This design ensures that, unlike in
purely randomized order, target stimuli could not appear back-to-back or in runs. This
feature offers an important control as subjective perception of greater target probability –
which can be caused by consecutive targets (Sommer, Matt, & Leuthold, 1990) –
attenuates the p3 signal and delays peak latency (Johnson & Donchin, 1980).
The Present Study

23
Given the consistent evidence supporting ART, and the lack of conclusive
evidence to understand ERP correlates of scene naturalness and attention restoration, the
study presented herein investigated such correlates in neurotypical adults. Specifically,
this study was conducted to address the following questions: 1) Are naturalness and
restorativeness inherently related constructs in attention restoration processes, or can they
be effectively delineated? 2) Can attention restoration be validated neurophysiologically
using rigorous ERP methodology? This general population was chosen because the study
addressed open questions in both attention restoration and ERP research. The paradigm
was an active, two-stimulus oddball task to elicit the p3 and LPP ERP components to
investigate modulation between environmentally and restoratively defined standard
stimuli.
This study investigated the effect of high and low restorative, and natural and
built, standard stimuli on p3 and LPP topography in a two-stimulus, active oddball task,
in a mixed-ANOVA design. The 10-trial-sequence oddball paradigm, and EEG
recording, was used to investigate these components’ modulation by the above factors at
frontal, orbito-parietal, temporal, and occipital regions of interest (ROIs). One geometric
(geo-) pattern target stimulus was presented at low frequency within a sequence of a
repeating standard stimulus. That is, standard trials within each condition were the same
image for one participant. However, each of six highly restorative nature (HR-N) images
(with restorativeness level according to the online ratings described above) was matched
on restorativeness with one of six high restorative built (HR-B) images, and each of six
low restorative nature (LR-N) images was matched with one of six low restorative built
(LR-B) images. These pairs were planned to rotate across participants 8 times throughout

24
each group so that naturalness was a between-groups factor and restorativeness was a
within-groups factor. This standard stimulus repetition scheme within participant was
used to avoid novelty confounds of p3 amplitude as a function of within-block standard
stimulus diversity. This method was chosen so that even though each participant sees one
stimulus for each block to eliminate within-block standard stimulus diversity, if summary
effects were observed across the sample, conclusions could be drawn for these stimuli as
categories. Further, long target-to-target intervals (TTIs; produced by the controlled
occurrence of targets within sequences of stimuli), as well as a very low (10%) target
frequency rate, have shown to produce larger amplitudes than short TTIs because the p3
generation system has sufficient time to recover, eliminating p3 signal attenuation over
time (Gonsalvez & Polich, 2002).
This paradigm was also designed to be more conducive to attention restoration as
participants invariably saw one standard stimulus throughout the condition and images
were presented for two seconds each. Because attention restoration works by involuntary
attention being engaged (fascination) long enough (extent) for directed attention
resources to replenish, extremely brief, flashy presentations of varying images would not
theoretically result in restoration. Ulrich (1983) reviews some findings of a positive
statistical relationship between the strength of the restoration response and viewing time.
Lee and colleagues (2015) found that a single 40-second viewing of a green roof
environment produced an attention restoration effect in their participants. Forty seconds
is longer than typical stimulus durations in computerized experiments but likely much
shorter than real world environmental exposures. In the present study, the presentation
characteristics should have allowed the extent and coherence image traits of restorative

25
environments to maintain involuntary attention long enough for restoration to occur.
Further, target rarity and controlled sequencing should produce generally strong p3
potentials within which to observe effects.
The task included three blocks each comprising 24 sequences. Each block had a
different standard stimulus with respect to perceived restorativeness/naturalness.
Subjective preference ratings, including attractiveness, potential to visit, valence, and
arousal, were collected for the selected stimuli, from the ERP participants once they
completed the oddball task, to potentially explain LPP amplitude differences that may
emerge between conditions to gain insight into the explanation of such differences
previously observed. Also, these ratings were used to confirm that the experimental
sample experienced the images as intended based on their selection from the image pool
rated by an online sample.
The hypotheses are as follows: 1) p3 peak amplitude would be greater – and peak
latency earlier – for targets in HR standard stimulus blocks compared to LR and the
brown tile (Br) control block; particularly in frontal and parietal ROIs with parietal
showing the strongest activation, as has been consistently documented for active target
discrimination tasks (Polich, 2007). 2) Behavioral data would reveal faster RTs to targets
in the HR blocks than those in LR and Br blocks. 3) Given that LPP amplitude has shown
to be an index of affective processing, there is expected to be a significant interaction
between restorativeness and naturalness with respect to LPP activation. Specifically, HRN images were expected to produce the greatest average LPP amplitude in the parietal
ROI than HR-B, LR-B, LR-N images, or Br, as informed by Roe and colleagues’ (2013)
finding that nature images were more positively valent than urban images. Previous

26
findings have also shown restorativeness and preference to be highly positively correlated
(r = .82, p < .01; Berto, 2007). If differential LPP amplitude is observed for presumably
valence-neutral geo-pattern targets between condition, Mahamane and colleagues’ (2020)
original hypothesis that restoration would affect target LPP, would also be supported with
greater conclusiveness. These two explanations for LPP differences for scenic and geopattern stimuli are not mutually exclusive. 4) Subjective preference ratings were expected
to be higher for HR vs LR and N vs B images.

27
CHAPTER II
METHOD
Participants
Rating Sample
Four hundred and eighty-seven, self-reported neurotypical adults (305 women,
169 men, 1 intersex person, 2 transgender men, 1 transgender woman, 8, gender nonconforming, and 1 preferred not to answer; age range = 18-37, M = 24.97, SD = 3.13)
were recruited via Amazon Mturk to rate the images in the stimulus pool on the PRSshort and Roe and colleagues’ (2013) subjective preference items. Recruitment was
restricted to English speakers residing in the United States of America. Each participant
was compensated 1.50 USD. This sample size produced between 53 and 67
restorativeness scores per image as the images were divided into 8 subsets for rating
collection to be feasible logistically. The survey was programmed in Qualtrics, an online
survey platform, to randomly assign participants to one of the 8 photo subsets. The rating
procedures is described in detail below. Past research used groups of 8 per subset (Berto,
2005) or 6-9 participants per subset (Mahamane et al., 2020).
ERP Sample
Thirty-nine neurotypical, right-handed adults (25 women; age range = 18-29, M =
20.97, SD = 2.51) were recruited at Utah State University using the online SONA
research participation system. This age range was intentionally restricted to 18-30 years
because studies have consistently shown significantly decreasing parietal p3 amplitude
after peaking around age 21, with the first significant decrease seen between age bins 2030 and 35-45 (van Dinteren, Arns, Jongsma, & Kessels, 2014). Participants were

28
assigned to the nature version (n = 21) or built version (n = 18) of the experiment based
on the order in which they arrived for the study.
Originally, the target sample size was N = 96. This sample size was chosen
because, while a minimum of 28 participants is necessary to achieve conventionally
sufficient statistical power (1 – β ≥ .80) for the within-subjects comparison between
restorativeness conditions, at least 43 per group is needed to meet the same power
requirement for the between-subjects naturalness comparison. The total of 86 was
increased to 96 so that the respective six of the twelve stimulus pairs can rotate
completely throughout each group eight times. However, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic
disrupted the further collection of data when the USU IRB placed a hold on all in-person
data collection in human research at USU. Thus, the sample size collected was 60. Of
these, 39 produced enough usable data after all artifact rejection and epoch removal due
to participant errors.
At the time of online sign-up, participants were informed of the required age
range, that they must be right-handed, and that they must have no formally diagnosed
history of neurodevelopmental disorder. When they arrived at the lab for their
appointment, handedness was confirmed using a questionnaire (Edinburgh Handedness
Inventory: Short Form; Veale, 2013). Then, they were asked again to confirm their age
and that they had no lifetime history of any formally diagnosed neurodevelopmental
disorders (e.g., ADHD). Left- or mixed-handedness, indicated by a score less than 16 on
the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory: Short Form, or a history of any neurological
diagnoses, disqualified individuals from participation. Handedness was controlled for
because previous research has found that left-handed people show greater p3 amplitude,

29
and earlier latency overall, compared to right-handed people. Target p3 amplitude was
specifically larger in frontal and central areas (Alexander & Polich, 1995). Participants
were compensated with course credit and 10 USD.
Materials
Subjective Ratings
Edinburgh Handedness Inventory – Short Form. Veale (2013) validated a
short form of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield, 1971) that consists of four
items versus the original ten (see Appendix A) which are rated on a 5-point Likert scale
regarding how often the participant performs that activity with their left hand (1) or their
right hand (5). Ratings were then summed across the items. Left-handedness on this scale
is represented by scores less than or equal to 8. Right handedness is represented by scores
greater than or equal to 16. Scores of 9-15 represent mixed-handedness. This scale was
administered upon arrival to ensure that all participants were right-handed.
Subjective preference ratings. Ratings were obtained with Roe and colleagues’
(2013) items for ‘image attractiveness’, ‘potential behavior’ (desire to visit that scene),
‘valence’, and ‘arousal’ of all 16 stimuli. However, an extra item was added as a fifth
Likert scale with anchors, Mentally Tired (1) and Mentally Energetic (10), to differentiate
arousal physically and mentally to more accurately reflect its connotation regarding
cognitive resource availability as relevant to p3 elicitation (Polich, 2007; Appendix B).
For ratings of control and target stimuli, the word “picture” stood in for “place” in the
items. Each image’s score for each preference construct was taken from the average
rating across participants on the item for that construct.

30
PRS-short. This measure, adapted by Berto (2005) from the original PRS
contains five items, each corresponding to one of the environmental components of
restoration (separating extent and coherence), to be rated on an 11-point Likert scale from
0 (Not at all) to 10 (Very much) indicating the “degree to which each statement describes
the current picture” (Appendix C). In her report, Berto (2005) specified that this scale
showed a Cronbach’s alpha of .79 and considered this to be sufficiently internally
consistent.
Stimuli
Experimental scene stimuli were selected from the 418-image pool used in
(Mahamane et al., 2020). As they describe, images were crowd-sourced via Facebook
and, for that study, had been rated on the PRS-short by 34 adults. However, given the size
of the stimulus set, when these ratings were collected, images were divided into 8 subsets
(6 sets of 52, 2 sets of 53) for which 6 – 9 participants rated each subset (some rated two
sets on separate days). The present study includes more ratings that were previously
collected so that at least 53 participants rated each subset (and thus each image). The
largest group rating a subset contained 68 participants.
These images were also previously categorized by a different adult sample (N =
51; aged 19-38 years) as being either nature or built scenes in a dichotomous, forcedchoice task. Participants were shown 418 images in randomized order, one at a time, in a
self-paced computer program. This categorization procedure was necessary to understand
how people perceive the naturalness of the images because many of the photos are
composed of natural and manmade constituents to various degrees. Images were then
classed into quintiles based on the percentage of participants who called each image

31
‘nature’ with cutoffs at every multiple of 20%. In their study, Mahamane and colleagues
(2020) considered any image categorized as nature by 60% or more of the sample as a
“nature” scene, and any image categorized as nature by 40% or less of the sample as a
“built” scene. It is likely that one contributor to the previous study not finding a p3 effect
was the amount of stimulus diversity in terms of naturalness that could be present within
each category given these wide ranges of inclusion. Thus, for the present study, images
were defined as non-hybrid nature scenes if they were categorized as “nature” by 80% or
more of the participants, and non-hybrid built scenes if they were categorized as “nature”
by 20% or less.
In the present study, five one-way ANOVA’s were performed to compare
between-group ratings from the ratings sample for each of the 5 images that were present
in every subset. There were no significant effects of group on perceived restorativeness
for any of the five subset-overlapping images (α = .05). Similarly, five one-way
ANOVA’s were conducted per image common across all subsets for each of the five
subjective preference items. One image showed an effect of group on valence (F(7, 478)
= 2.105, p = .042, η2 = .030) such that two of the eight groups significantly differed from
one another as shown by post hoc comparisons (p = .050). The same image showed an
effect of group on self-rated desire to visit the scene in the image (F(7, 478) = 2.247, p =
.029, η2 = .032). However, there were no significant between-groups differences revealed
by pairwise comparisons at the .05 alpha level. Another of the common images showed a
significant effect of group on self-rated perceived attractiveness of the image (F(7, 474) =
2.161, p = .036, η2 = .031). No pairwise comparisons revealed significant between-groups
differences. Finally, one more of the common images showed a significant effect of

32
group on self-rated physical arousal (F(7, 478) = 2.303, p = .026, η2 = .033). Once more,
pairwise comparisons did not reveal any significant between-groups differences at the .05
level. These few significant effects all bore small effect sizes and only one showed there
to be only two groups different from each other pairwise. Thus, it is not expected that
these rare small differences meaningfully affected ratings such that they could not be
used to select stimuli.
These perceived restorativeness scores and naturalness categorization rates were
used to select stimuli and organize them into 12 matched pairs. This matching was
conducted using log transformed perceived restorativeness ratings as a Shapiro-Wilk test
revealed that the raw ratings of the nature images were not normally distributed (W =
.930, p < .001). Specifically, 6 nature images above the overall Log10 restorativeness
mean were matched as closely as possible on with 6 built images above the overall Log10
restorativeness mean. The same was done with nature and built images below the
restorativeness mean. restorative nature images, and the same for built images,
specifically by restorativeness rank within extreme tails of the restorativeness
distribution. See Table 2.1 for the images’ naturalness categorization and perceived
restorativeness scores, organized by matched pair. See Appendix D for the experimental
stimuli.
A solid brown tile (RGB: 160,82,45) was the standard stimulus in the control
block as studies have shown very few children (Boyatzis & Varghese, 1994) and adults
(Hemphill, 1996) to have emotional associations with brown, while this was not true for
most other colors. Thus, three restorativeness conditions varied between blocks: HR, LR,
and Br. Three of Berto’s (2005) geo-patterns were selected as targets to pseudo-randomly

33
rotate condition assignment between participants. See Appendix E for control and target
stimuli. All images in the study were kept in their original 4:3 aspect ratio and displayed
on a 23” widescreen monitor with 2.5” white side borders to prevent distortion caused by
stretching to the screen’s 16:9 aspect ratio.
EEG Recording
Electrophysiological data were recorded directly from the scalp via gold-plated
silver electrodes using the 14-channel Emotiv Epoc mobile EEG cap onto a Windows PC.
The 14 electrodes were placed over brain regions across the entire scalp (AF3, F7, F3,
FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, and AF4). Samples were collected at a rate of
128 per second (2048 Hz internal). Scalp impedance was below 10kΩ at recording onset.
The felt scalp contacts for each electrode were rewetted with saline solution during the
rest breaks between experimental blocks.

Procedure
Ratings
Design. The 8 rating subsets had 5 images in common and differed by their
remaining images. Participants were recruited to respond to the rating survey via Amazon
Mturk. Having 8 overlapping subsets facilitated data collection and management by
allowing comparisons across rating groups to check that their ratings do not significantly
differ, as described above. Each participant rated one of these subsets, so that each image
was rated by at least 53 participants. The survey was programmed in Qualtrics to
randomly route participants to one of 8 rating surveys corresponding to the 8 subsets.
This procedure resulted in roughly equal group sizes across subsets but uncontrollable
factors, such as multiple participants beginning at the same time, or the participant quota
being reached as some participants finish while others are mid-survey, resulted in
different group sizes for each image subset. As a result, participant group sizes for the
ratings obtained per image subset were 68, 62, 62, 56, 62, 53, 62, 62.
Presentation. For this rating sample, participants provided informed consent
online before participating. Participants responded on a computer (the survey program
prohibited participation via smartphone) at their own location. Participants were asked
the dimensions of the screen on which they viewed the images (they could alternatively
provide the make and model of their screen). While each image was on the screen,
participants rated it on all items of the PRS-short and the five subjective preference items.
ERP’s
Upon arrival to the lab, participants read and signed informed consent after any
additional questions regarding the study had been answered to their satisfaction. At this

36
point, they were seated in a chair 24” from the monitor. Then, the experimenter placed
the Emotiv cap on the participant’s head and ensured that all electrode sites showed
impedance of less than 10kΩ before commencing data recording.
After EEG recording began, instructions were displayed on the screen as follows:
“You will view various images. Please keep your fingers of your preferred hand rested on
the SPACEBAR while the experiment is in progress. Press SPACEBAR ONLY ONCE
as quickly as you can only when you see a geometric pattern; not a scene or a solid brown
tile. Please keep your attention on the screen unless instructed otherwise. Press
SPACEBAR to continue…”. Then, a very brief training phase began in which each
image for that block, standard and target, were displayed with the labels “DO NOT press
spacebar” and “press spacebar”, respectively. Following training was one practice
sequence to ensure the participant understood the instructions. If they responded correctly
to the sequence by pressing spacebar for the target, and making no responses for the
standards, they advanced to the experimental phase. If not, the practice sequence was
repeated until they responded correctly, with a limit of three attempts before excusal from
the experiment. (All participants passed all practices for all blocks.) Then, the three-block
procedure began.
Blocks corresponded to restorativeness (HR, LR, and Br; within-subjects factor).
Groups corresponded to naturalness (nature and built; between-subjects factor). Block
order was counterbalanced across within-group participants so that participants in each
group rotated through the six distinct orders. Each stimulus block consisted of 24 ten-trial
sequences. Each sequence displayed the target only once and only in either the 7th, 8th,
9th, or 10th sequential position (6 instances in each position throughout the block in

37
random order). This design provided 72 target ERP trials per participant; 24 per
condition, to exceed the targeted 20 for p3 analyses by a 4-ERP buffer in consideration of
epoch (individual time window of an ERP) attrition due to artifacts (Cohen & Polich,
1997). Within each sequence, each trial began with a 500 ms fixation point (+), centered
vertically and horizontally on the screen, followed by the trial image for 2000 ms, and
ending with another fixation point of randomly varying duration between 300 and 700
ms, resulting in a total ISI varying between 800 – 1200 ms. This “jittering” is commonly
used to ensure wash-out of inevitable ERP overlap from one epoch to the next when
baseline activation averages are taken (Luck, 2014). This is more relevant for LPP
analyses than p3 analyses. After the variable post-stimulus fixation, the task immediately
proceeded to the next trial. Between blocks, a 2-minute rest period took place. The
training phase and practice trial(s) occurred for each block (Figure 2.1).
Upon completion of the oddball task, the EEG cap was removed and participants
rated all of the scenic stimulus images that were chosen for the experiment (24 images)
on the five subjective preference items and the PRS-short via a separate, self-paced
computer program that visually presented photos one-at-a-time in the same survey format
as in the larger, online rating collection described above. Following ratings, participants
were debriefed and excused. All participants in the ERP sample experienced the oddball
task and rated the experimental stimuli on the same computer and monitor. All of these
procedures were approved by the USU Institutional Review Board (IRB).

In the 10-trial sequence, the first six trials were consistently standard (Si) stimuli. The

CHAPTER III
RESULTS
Subjective Ratings
Rating sample
PRS-short results, and the results from the five subjective preference items are
reported above in the description of stimulus selection.
ERP sample
Perceived Restorativeness. PRS-short ratings were averaged across the
experimental stimuli within a category for each participant. That is, for each participant
their PRS-short ratings for the six HR-N images used in the experiment were averaged to
produce a HR-N perceived restorativeness mean. This was computed for HR-B, LR-N,
and LR-B categories as well. Then, a mixed ANOVA was conducted with stimulus
category as the within-subjects factor and group (nature vs. built) as the between-subjects
factor. Mauchly’s test of sphericity revealed a violation (W = .696, p = .024), so the
results are reported with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction, a repeated-measures ANOVA
adjustment that is robust to violations of sphericity, or equal variances across the times of
measurement (Abdi, 2010). The results showed a main effect of stimulus category on
PRS-short ratings in the ERP sample (F(2.547, 111.992) = 61.393, p < .001, ηp2 = .624)
such that HR-N stimuli (M = 8.891, SD = 1.056) were rated as most restorative, followed
by HR-B (M = 8.209, SD = 1.196), LR-N (M = 7.353, SD = 1.610), and LR-B (M =
5.978, SD = 1.371). Holm pairwise comparisons showed that HR-N differed from HR-B
(p = .003). All other pairwise comparisons showed differences below the α = .001 level

40
(Figure 3.2a). There was no significant group by category interaction. Nor was there a
significant effect of group on PRS-short ratings. See Table 3.1 for group means.

Subjective Preference. In the same fashion as the PRS-short ratings, averaged
subjective preference ratings of the HR-N, HR-B, LR-N, and LR-B image categories,
collected from the ERP participants after the experiment, were compared using mixed
ANOVAs with image category as the within-subjects factor and group (nature vs. built)
as the between-subjects factor, for attractiveness, desire to visit, valence, physical
arousal, and mental arousal.
Scene Attractiveness. For scene attractiveness, Mauchly’s test of sphericity again
revealed a violation (W = .535, p < .001), so, again, the results are reported with a
Greenhouse-Geisser correction. There was a main effect of stimulus category on image
attractiveness in the ERP sample (F(2.214, 106.282) = 102.112, p < .001, ηp2 = .734) such
that HR-N stimuli (M = 8.654, SD = 0.912) were rated as most attractive, followed by
HR-B (M = 7.919, SD = 1.163), LR-N (M = 6.846, SD = 1.470), and LR-B (M = 5.009,
SD = 1.501). Holm-Sidak pairwise comparisons showed each category to significantly
differ from each other category at the α =.001 level (Figure 3.2b). This pairwise test
works in a stepwise fashion so as to avoid aggregating Type I error probability with each
pairwise comparison, as is the risk in a Tukey test. However, as such, Holm-Sidak

41
comparisons cannot predict confidence intervals (Holm, 1979). There was no significant
group by category interaction. Nor was there a significant effect of group on
attractiveness ratings. See Table 3.2 for group means.

Desire to Visit. For ratings of participants’ desire to visit the scene in the
experimental images for each category, Mauchly’s test of sphericity again revealed a
violation (W = .534, p < .001), so, again, the results are reported with a GreenhouseGeisser correction. There was a main effect of stimulus category on desire to visit for the
ERP sample (F(2.258, 88.557) = 80.804, p < .001, ηp2 = .686) such that HR-N stimuli (M
= 8.701, SD = 0.925) were rated as most likely to be visited, followed by HR-B (M =
8.060, SD = 1.307), LR-N (M = 6.645, SD = 1.625), and LR-B (M = 5.205, SD = 1.709).
Holm pairwise comparisons showed that HR-N differed from HR-B (p = .008). All other
pairwise comparisons showed differences below the α = .001 level (Figure 3.2c). There
was no significant group by category interaction. Nor was there a significant effect of
group on desire to visit. See Table 3.3 for group means.

Valence. For ratings of image valence, Mauchly’s test of sphericity again
revealed a violation (W = .660, p = .011), so, again, the results are reported with a
Greenhouse-Geisser correction. There was a main effect of stimulus category on valence
for the ERP sample (F(2.319, 85.808) = 78.147, p < .001, ηp2 = .679) such that HR-N
stimuli (M = 8.278, SD = 1.137) were rated as the happiest, followed by HR-B (M =
7.487, SD = 1.251), LR-N (M = 6.744, SD = 1.302), and LR-B (M = 5.389, SD = 1.008).
Holm pairwise comparisons showed each category to significantly differ from each other
category below the α = .001 level (Figure 3.2d). There was no significant group by

Physical Arousal. For ratings of how much scenes in each category inspired
physical arousal (calm vs excited), the assumption of sphericity was not violated (W =

43
.790, p = .135), so no correction was applied to the results. There was a significant group
x restorativeness category interaction effect on ratings of inspired physical arousal (F(3,
111) = 2.756, p = .046, ηp2 = .069; Figure 4e) such that participants from the nature
experimental group rated HR-N scenes higher in evoking physical arousal than
participants from the built experimental group (p = .042). Further, participants in the
nature experimental group rated HR-N scenes higher in evoking physical arousal than
participants in the built experimental group rating HR-B scenes (p = .019), and
participants in either group rating LR-B (nature group, p < .001; built group, p = .019)
and LR-N scenes (nature group, p = .013; built group, p < .001). Participants in the nature
experimental group rated HR-B scenes as evoking more physical arousal than
participants in the built experimental group rated LR-N scenes (p = .008), and
participants in the nature experimental group rating LR-B scenes (p = .044).
There was a significant effect of stimulus category on ratings of physical arousal
for the ERP sample (F(3, 111) = 6.139, p < .001, ηp2 = .142). Holm pairwise comparisons
showed no difference between HR-N (M = 6.073, SD = 1.668) and HR-B (M = 5.778, SD
= 1.663; p = .605). Significant differences were revealed between HR-N and LR-N (M =
5.038, SD = 1.600; p = .002), between HR-N and LR-B (M = 5.150, SD = 0.829; p =
.010), and between HR-B and LR-N (p =.035). There was no difference between HR-B
and LR-B (p = .104). There was no difference between LR-N and LR-B (p = .605; Figure
3.2e). See Table 3.5 for group means.
Finally, there was also a significant main effect of group (F(1, 37) = 7.299, p =
.010, ηp2 = .165) such that participants in the nature experimental group rated images,

44
regardless of category, as being more physically arousing (M = 5.893, SD = 1.508) than
participants in the built experimental group (M = 5.063, SD = 1.197; Figure 3.1).

Mental Arousal. For ratings of each image on mental arousal (mentally fatigued
vs. mentally energetic), Mauchly’s test of sphericity once more revealed a violation (W =
.615, p = .004), so, again, the results are reported with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction.
There was a main effect of stimulus category on image self-rated mental arousal for the

Behavioral Data
Trials with anticipatory or delayed responses (200 ms > RT > 1200) were
removed from all analyses as extremely fast responses imply anticipation and extremely
slow responses imply processing interference by task-extraneous information, rather than
valid stimulus processing (Ulrich & Miller, 1994). There was no significant difference
between groups in number of trials removed for being outside of this valid RT window
(t(37) = 0.951, p = .348). The number of trials dropped for anticipatory or delayed
responses was positively skewed across the sample (skewness = 1.455; Mode = 0, Mdn =
2, M = 5.564, SD = 7.369).
Error data (missed targets and false alarms) were analyzed to assess accuracy and
check for unexpected differences between conditions. A mixed-method ANOVA was
used to compare false alarms – incorrectly responding to a non-target stimulus – between
groups and between groups and stimulus categories. Results showed no interaction effect
of stimulus category and naturalness group on false alarms. Nor did either factor
significantly affect false alarms on its own. There was not a single recorded miss in the
data. That is, all targets in epochs that were not filtered out in previous steps were
correctly responded to with a spacebar press. At this point, inaccurate response trials
were removed from further analyses as they do not reflect valid stimulus processing.
Mean target RTs were compared between conditions as the primary behavioral
measure of performance quality using a mixed-method ANOVA with the same factors as
described above. There was no significant interaction effect of stimulus category and
naturalness group on RT. Nor were there effects of either factor on RT. For both false
alarms and RT, counterbalancing order was included as a between-groups factor to check

48
for any order effects. There was no significant between-groups effect of counterbalancing
order on either measure.
ERP’s
Only target trials with correct responses occurring between 200 and 1200 ms of
stimulus onset were included in target ERP analyses (Wiersema, van der Meere, Antrop,
& Roeyers, 2006). Before epochs were extracted, the data were bandpass filtered at 0.0159 Hz. Stimulus-synchronized epochs were extracted using an event-locked time window
beginning 200 ms before image onset and ending 2000 ms after, well encompassing the
theoretical timeframes of the target ERP components. Then, epochs with either
abnormally trending (upward or downward linear drift) or improbable (extreme activity
occurring beyond ±4 standard deviations of an electrode’s mean) artifactual data were
rejected algorithmically using independent component analysis (ICA). ICA is the most
used statistical procedure for such rejection. It is a statistical method used to identify
within the data a set of components, each of which has a unique scalp distribution (Luck,
2014). Components are visually inspected and those with artifactual characteristics, any
signal not characteristic of cognitive activity, are manually removed. See Figure 3.3 for
examples of accepted and rejected components using ICA. For both p3 and LPP analyses,
block order was included as a between-subjects factor to check for potential effects of
habituation, fatigue, or attention restoration carry-over.

right of each figure. The heat maps show evenly spread polarity across trials and the
scalp. The rejected component figures (b) do not show these key features.

50
p3
p3 amplitude was defined as the mean amplitude between 200 ms and 600 ms
post stimulus onset, relative to the mean amplitude of the 200-ms period before stimulus
onset, given that stimulus duration in the present study was 2000 ms, and thus p3’s could
be occurring later in the epochs. This relatively large window was used because the p3
latency from stimulus onset can vary widely under different conditions (Luck, 2014;
Polich, 2007). Fifty percent fractional peak latency (FPL) was used to assess p3 latency
and is defined as the timepoint at which the 50% amplitude of the peak amplitude in the
window occurs, between 200 ms and the peak. Amplitude and latency were assessed for
frontal (AF3, AF4, F3, F4, FC5, FC6, F7, F8), parietal (P7, P8), temporal (T7, T8), and
occipital (O1, O2) ROIs. Grand means were taken across target and standard trials for
both p3 mean amplitude and FPL. Then, target p3 mean amplitude and latency for each
ROI were compared across standard stimulus conditions using mixed-design ANOVAs
with restorativeness block and ROI as within-subject factors, and naturalness condition as
the between-subjects factor. Greenhouse-Geisser was applied to all results to correct for
sphericity violations.
Amplitude. Results showed a significant ROI x Condition x Stimulus interaction
effect on p3 mean amplitude (F(4.837, 377.255) = 3.557, p = .004, ηp2 = .044).
Specifically, p3 amplitude for HR standards was greater in the occipital ROI than in the
frontal ROI (p < .001), as well as when comparing frontal amplitude of HR standards
with occipital amplitude of LR standards (p = .007). p3 amplitude was also greater for
HR standards in the occipital ROI than for LR standards in the frontal ROI (p < .001).
HR and LR standards both showed greater amplitude in the occipital ROI than both HR

51
and LR standards in the frontal ROI (p’s < .001). HR standards showed greater amplitude
in the occipital ROI than HR targets in the temporal ROI (p’s < .001). LR standards
showed greater amplitude in the occipital ROI than LR targets in the temporal ROI (p =
.004) and HR targets in the temporal ROI (p < .003). HR standard amplitude in the
occipital ROI was greater than Br standard amplitude in the parietal ROI (p = .002). HR
and LR standard amplitude in the occipital ROI were both greater than Br standard
amplitude in the occipital ROI (p’s < .001). And, HR target amplitude in the occipital
ROI was lower than HR standard amplitude in the occipital ROI (p = .037). See Figure
3.4 for average amplitude across the ERP window, by condition, ROI, and stimulus type,
for p3.
There was also a significant ROI x Condition interaction (F(4.837, 377.255) =
4.552, p < .001, ηp2 = .055). HR p3 amplitude in the occipital ROI was greater across
conditions than HR amplitude in the frontal ROI (p = .007), as was LR p3 amplitude (p <
.001). HR and LR p3 occipital amplitude was also greater than LR frontal p3 amplitude
(p’s = .001). Each of the following condition-ROI combinations showed greater p3
amplitude than Br temporal amplitude: HR-parietal (p = .039), LR-parietal (p = .019),
HR-occipital (p < .001), and LR-occipital (p < .001). The following condition-ROI
combinations showed greater p3 amplitude than HR-temporal: LR-parietal (p = .011),
HR-occipital (p < .001), and LR-occipital (p < .001). The following condition-ROI
combinations showed greater p3 amplitude than LR-temporal: HR-parietal (p = .034),
LR-parietal (p = .034), HR-occipital (p < .001), and LR-occipital (p < .001). And, HRoccipital and LR-occipital showed greater p3 amplitude than both Br-parietal (p’s < .001)

52
and Br-occipital (p’s < .001). In summary, HR conditions in posterior ROI’s showed
greatest amplitude compared to Br and LR conditions and in anterior ROI’s.
Finally, there was a significant effect of ROI (F(2.418, 377.255) = 15.627, p <
.001, ηp2 = .091). The occipital ROI was greater in p3 amplitude than the frontal (p <=
.001), temporal (p < .001), and parietal (p = .046) ROI’s. The parietal ROI showed
greater p3 amplitude than the temporal (p < .001). The frontal ROI showed greater p3
amplitude than the temporal ROI (p = .006). There was no difference between the parietal
and frontal ROI’s (p = .188).
Counterbalancing order was included as a factor in the model to check for order
effects and there was a significant group x stimulus x order interaction (F(5, 156) =
3.131, p = .010, ηp2 = .091). Post hoc comparisons revealed only a few pairwise
differences. Target trials in the nature experimental group in order 4 (LR-N, Br, HR-N)
showed greater p3 mean amplitude than standard trials in the built experimental group,
order 1 (HR-B, LR-B, Br; p = .005). Target trials in the nature experimental group in
order 4 showed greater p3 amplitude than target trials in the nature experimental group in
order 3 (LR-N, HR-N, Br; p = .005). And, target trials in the nature experimental group in
order 4 showed greater p3 amplitude than target trials in the built experimental group in
order 6 (Br, LR-B, HR-B; p = .036). Only two participants experienced order 4 in the
nature experimental group after unusable data rejection and the effect of restrictions on
further data collection that were imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is expected
that, had a completely counterbalanced data set been obtained, this order interaction
would not be present. It is likely that, due to this imbalance in the number of participants

53
per order, the finding of an order effect is spurious and that order 4 of the experimental
conditions does not uniquely impact p3 amplitude meaningfully.

Latency. There were significant ROI x condition (F(5.449, 375.959) = 5.801, p <
.001, ηp2 = .078, small) and ROI x stimulus (F(2.724, 375.959) = 44.519, p < .001, ηp2 =
.244, medium-large) interaction effects on FLP (Figure 3.5). The ROI x condition
interaction showed that occipital-HR p3 FLP was earlier than frontal-Br, temporal-Br,
parietal-Br, frontal-HR, temporal-HR, frontal-LR, and temporal- LR, all below the α =
.001 level. Occipital-LR p3 FLP was earlier than-Br (p = .014), temporal-Br (p = .004),
parietal-Br (p = .011), frontal-HR (p < .001), temporal-HR (p = .004), frontal-LR (p <
.001), and temporal-LR (p < .001). Frontal-HR p3 FLP was later than frontal-Br (p =
.002), temporal-Br (p = .007), parietal-Br (p = .002), occipital-Br (p < .001), temporalHR (p = .002), parietal-HR (p < .001), and parietal-LR (p < .001).
The ROI x stimulus interaction showed that frontal p3 FLP for standard stimuli
was later than temporal-standard, parietal-standard, occipital-standard, frontal-target,
temporal-target, parietal-target, and occipital-target, all below the α = .001 level.
Temporal p3 FLP for standard stimuli was later than that of parietal-standard and
occipital standard, both below the α = .001 level. Parietal p3 FLP for standard stimuli was
later than occipital-standard (p = .004), and earlier than frontal-target, temporal-target,
parietal-target, and occipital-target, all below the α = .001 level. Finally, occipital p3 FLP
for standard stimuli was earlier than frontal-target, temporal-target, parietal-target, and
occipital-target (all below the α = .001 level).
There was a medium-large main effect of ROI (F(2.724, 375.959) = 45.517, p <
.001, ηp2 = .248) such that frontal p3 FLP was later than temporal, parietal, and occipital
p3 FLP, all below the α = .001 level. Temporal p3 FLP was later than parietal and

56
occipital p3 FLP, both below the α = .001 level. Parietal p3 FLP was later than occipital
p3 FLP (p < .001).
Finally, there was a main effect of stimulus in which target trials had later p3 FLP
than standard trials (F(1, 138) = 17.947, p < .001, 115, medium). When counterbalancing
order was included as a factor in the model, there was no effect of order, nor interactions
between order and any other factors.

LPP
The average amplitude across the windows from 600-1000 ms and from 10002000 ms post-stimulus represented early and late LPP activation (LPP-E, LPP-L),
respectively (MacNamara et al., 2011). ROIs analyzed were the same as for p3. Then,

58
grand means taken across standard and target epochs were compared between
restorativeness blocks and naturalness conditions using mixed-design ANOVAs with
block and ROI as within-subject factors, and naturalness condition as a between-subjects
factor. Greenhouse-Geisser corrections were applied to all results to correct for sphericity
violations.
LPP-E. At the ROI level, there were no significant effects or interactions of any
factors on LPP-E. The model was thus rerun with channel as a within-subjects factor,
rather than ROI (which are pooled channels). This model showed a significant interaction
effect of channel x group x order on LPP-E (F(28.145, 878.130) = 2.044, p < .001, ηp2 =
.061). The interaction showed consistently that LPP-E amplitude in the nature
experimental group for order 4 at channel O2 was significantly lower in its pairwise
comparisons with other group-order-channel combinations (p’s < .05) throughout the
14,028 pairwise comparisons in the model (2 x 6 x 14). Consistent with the interaction
with order for p3 amplitude, this order effect is likely due to there only being two
participants in the nature experimental group who received order 4 of the experimental
conditions.
After removing order from the model, there was a significant channel x stimulus
interaction (F(2, 216) = 3.325, p = .038; ηp2 = .030) and significant effects of condition
(F(2, 216) = 3.377, p = .036; ηp2 = .030) and channel (F(6.154, 1329.180) = 2.797, p =
.010; ηp2 = .013). Pairwise comparisons for the interaction between the 14 channels x two
stimulus types for the interaction revealed only one difference, that target trials at O2
showed lower LPP-E amplitude than standard trials at F7 (p = .004).

59
Pairwise comparisons for the channel effect showed that O2 showed lower LPP-E
amplitude than AF3 (p = .035), AF4 (p = .018), and F7 (p = .003; Figure 3.6). Pairwise
comparisons for the condition effect showed that HR images evoked greater LPP-E
amplitude than LR images (p < .038), though it is worth noting that the mean difference
was very small (MD = 0.0000002011, d = .167; Figure 3.6).

group was greater than in the built experimental group (t = 2.232, p < .027, d = .148;

CHAPTER IV
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to analyze ERP topography for neurophysiological
evidence of attention restoration using a two-stimulus, active oddball paradigm. Further,
the experimental design employed allowed the testing of naturalness and restorativeness
as separate factors. The study was designed to be an improvement upon the limitations
encountered by Mahamane and colleagues (2020) study, by reducing stimulus diversity
for any one participant to elicit more pronounced p3’s, using narrower ranges to qualify
images for the nature and built categories so that hybrid images were less likely to be
stimuli following the pre-established selection procedure, and by separating naturalness
and restorativeness as experimental factors. Below is discussion of the findings organized
by data type (i.e. subjective ratings, oddball task behavioral results, and oddball task ERP
results).
Perceived Restorativeness and Subjective Preference
The main effect of condition on perceived restorativeness ratings in the ERP
sample confirmed that the participants who completed the active oddball task
subjectively found the HR-N scenes to be most restorative, followed by HR-B, LR-N,
and LR-B, in that order. This difference was not moderated by experimental group. This
finding serves as a subjective manipulation check of the restorativeness conditions. This
finding also shows agreement between the online rating sample and the ERP sample, as
the online rating sample’s compiled responses were the basis for stimulus selection along
the lines of restorativeness.

63
The other subjective preference variables showed the same pattern except for the
degree to which the images evoked physical arousal. For physical arousal ratings, there
was an interaction between experimental group and stimulus category of the image. In
this interaction, participants in the nature experimental group rated HR-N scenes higher
than the built experimental group rating any type of scenes, and any group rating LR
scenes, both -N and -B. The nature experimental group did not rate HR-N scenes
significantly differently than HR-B scenes. Participants in the built experimental group
rating HR-N and HR-B scenes, did not rate either of those categories significantly
differently from any others besides the nature experimental group HR-N ratings
mentioned above. Stimulus naturalness was a between-groups variable while stimulus
restorativeness was a within-groups, yet all participants rated all experimental stimuli,
Thus, the differences within this interaction, taken together, suggest that both natural
scenes and high restorativeness contribute significantly to an environment’s evocation of
physical arousal.
The main effect of stimulus category, ignoring experimental group, on physical
arousal ratings showed that images in different environmental categories, but in the same
restorativeness level, were not rated differently. That is, HR-N and HR-B were not
significantly different, nor were LR-N and LR-B. The only cross-restorativeness
comparison that was not significantly different was HR-B versus LR-N. Significant
differences were seen between HR-N and LR-N, HR-N, and LR-B, and HR-B and LR-B.
This finding suggests that the same visual features that cause a person to perceive an
environment as natural, and those that cause them to perceive it as restorative, are most
motivating of physical activity.

64
Also noteworthy, the main effect of experimental group on physical arousal
ratings, with participants from the nature experimental group rating images as more
exciting than participants in the built experimental group, suggests that having viewed
nature scenes, across restorativeness levels, increases physical arousal independently of
the environmental stimulus later being viewed. Recall that every participant rated all
experimental scenic stimuli post experiment, including the stimuli from the other
naturalness group (e.g., participants in the nature experimental group also rated the built
stimuli) and the stimuli in the naturalness category of their own group that they did not
view during the experiment.
Behavioral Results
Analyses of RT and accuracy did not reveal significant interactions between
stimulus category and experimental group, nor effects of either factor independently.
High error rates were not necessarily expected to occur as the task was very easy and
designed to maintain participants’ sensitivity to the rare target stimulus, not induce high
cognitive load. In fact, there were no misses committed throughout the dataset. False
alarms did occur, however not differently on average between groups or conditions.
ERP Results
Across the analyses conducted for p3, LPP-E, and LPP-L, there were several
significant interactions and single-factor effects. All of these showed small effect sizes
(ηp2 < .10), yet with many showing p-values below .001. Given that the sample was
smaller than planned, it is expected that a complete sample of at least 48 per group would
show similar results with larger effect sizes. The greater the statistical power of an
analysis, the better equipped it is to detect small effects. That these small effects were

65
detected with an incomplete sample gives reason to suspect they are deflated from what
would be observed in adequately powered analyses. This limitation is also a
consideration for interpreting the somewhat unusual p3 patterns between standard and
target stimuli.
p3
Amplitude. The nature of the observed interaction of stimulus, condition, and
ROI in affecting p3 amplitude is unusual. Where p3 amplitude in standard trials differed
from target trials, standards showed greater amplitude or no difference when compared in
the same condition and ROI. Standard stimuli usually show weaker p3 activation than
targets given their high frequency. This reversal of the typical amplitude difference
between stimulus roles could be due to the standard stimuli being scenic while the
geometric pattern targets are repetitive patterns. Considering the attention restoration
components, fascination and scope, scenic images should inherently be higher in these
qualities than redundant geometric patterns. As such, participants could still be finding
novelty and fascination within the standard stimuli after many trials despite their
frequency. Olofsson, Nordin, Sequeira, and Polich (2008) explain that valence affects p3
amplitude such that pleasant images evoke greater amplitude than unpleasant images,
specifically when the targets are task-relevant as in the present study. It is likely that, in
the context of the experiment, the scenic standards were more pleasant to look at than the
geometric targets. That said, it is still questionable whether valence alone can explain the
standards’ greater amplitude than targets given the extensive documentation of reliable
p3 activation following rare stimuli. However, the finding that occipital p3 amplitude for
HR and LR standards was greater than occipital amplitude for Br control standards serves

66
as a better comparison supporting that the content of the experimental standards may be
inherently more pleasant as scenic stimuli rather than a plain brown screen when
frequency is held constant, resulting in stronger p3’s despite their high frequency.
Regarding the effect of ROI on p3 amplitude, at face value it would appear
unusual for parietal p3 amplitude to be lesser than occipital amplitude given that p3 is
well established as showing strong generation in the dorso-medial parietal lobes (Luck,
2014). However, Cohen’s d for that comparison was low (.151) and the distance on the
scalp from O1 and O2 to Pz, where traditionally the most prominent p3 activation is
detected, is shorter than the distance of P7 and P8 to Pz. So, it is likely that the channels
used to represent the occipital ROI in the present study were picking up more of the p3
signal from its most prominent central parietal generators than the channels used to
represent the parietal ROI. And, the Emotiv Epoc does not have channel locations along
the central “z-line” which includes the Pz channel.
Latency. The ROI x condition interaction showed that p3 FLP was earlier in
occipital lobes in HR conditions than most combinations of ROI and other conditions (Br
and LR). The same was true for occipital p3 FLP in LR conditions compared to other
combinations of ROI and condition, except for occipital HR p3 FPL. Thus, generally,
anterior p3 FPL was later and posterior p3 FPL was earlier. This finding makes sense
given that p3 propagates most strongly from centroparietal generators and the closest ROI
measured in the present study to that region was the occipital ROI.
Within the stimulus x ROI interaction, parietal standard FLP was later than
occipital standard FLP, but earlier than target FLP at all of the other ROI’s. Also,
occipital FLP for standard stimuli was earlier than target FLP at all ROI’s, including

67
occipital. That is, occipital standard FLP was earlier than occipital target FLP. This is an
especially important difference because it shows that in the same ROI with the strongest
p3 activation, target p3’s were slower to propagate than standard p3’s. The p3 component
is representative of stimulus informational processing, including categorical information.
Thus, the finding that rare target stimuli result in later propagation of the component than
frequent standard stimuli, especially in controlled sequences that ensure the interval
between targets is quite large, suggests that classification speed is slower when an
improbable but task relevant stimulus is presented. Polich (2012) explains that latency is
proportional to the time required for target detection and processing.
The main effect of ROI on p3 FLP was intuitive in that the earliest FLP was
recorded in the occipital ROI, the closest to the centroparietal location of p3 generation.
From there, each ROI moving forward anatomically was later than the one posterior to it
as the potential moves outward from its origin. In the main effect of stimulus, standard
trials showed earlier FLP than target trials.
p3 Summary. Taken together, the amplitude and FPL findings show that stimulus
processing involved more resources in a shorter timeframe for standard scenic stimuli,
and more time for detecting and processing target stimuli. Also, the HR condition showed
greater amplitude and earlier FLP than the LR and Br conditions and in posterior ROI’s,
with the greatest/earliest being the occipital ROI. These results indicate that images in the
HR conditions, specifically standards, recruited greater attentional resources without
sacrificing processing time compared to other conditions and targets, in appropriate
ROI’s. Earlier latency coupled with greater amplitude in the p3 window suggests

68
facilitated endogenous (task-driven) attention when looking at HR standards. Naturalness
group did not affect p3 amplitude or latency, but restorativeness level did.
LPP
LPP-E differences were observed in the early window at the channel level, but not
at the ROI level. LPP-L differences were only observed between groups in the late
window.
LPP-E. The interaction effect of channel and stimulus on LPP-E amplitude
revealed one specific pairwise difference between target LPP-E activation at O2 and
standard LPP-E activation at F7. The effect of channel showed greater activation at AF3,
AF4, and F7 compared to O2. These results are, again, unusual, and inconsistent with the
vast literature on LPP that demonstrates it is centroparietal generating as LPP is
essentially the measurement over time of the return to baseline of the p3 spike in activity
(Hajcak & Foti, 2020; Hajcak, Weinberg, MacNamara, & Foti, 2012). Usually, LPP
activation is greater in posterior ROI’s, especially at Pz, than anterior ROI’s. However,
within the frontal ROI is where Mahamane and colleagues (2020) observed the difference
in LPP between nature and built stimuli.
LPP is sometimes considered as beginning just after the p3 peak and is often
averaged over a window beginning at 400 ms (Hajcak et al., 2012; Hajcak & Foti, 2020;
MacNamara et al., 2011). Thus, considering an earlier window within the data may reveal
that, in terms of returning to baseline activity levels following p3 activation, LPP-E could
have returned more sharply, before 600 ms at channels nearest the centroparietal region.
However, a concern of such a reanalysis would be an overlap between the p3 and LPP-E
windows that would problematically entangle the two components in terms of drawing

69
conclusions. Future research using scenic standard stimuli should evaluate different
windows within the theoretical ranges of each of these components. Because p3 latency is
affected by various conditions (e.g., stimulus content, stimulus frequency, task difficulty),
there is not a narrow, established window in which to evaluate p3 amplitude. Rather, it
must be decided based on the design and stimuli of a given study (Luck, 2014). As such,
a wide p3 window was used for the present study given the exploratory stage of the
research into environmental effects on ERP components, and thus a later beginning of the
LPP-E window. Mahamane and colleagues (2020) used a similar LPP window, 550-930
ms, and found significant differences between nature and built stimuli suggesting that
nature was experienced more pleasantly than built. It is of note that, in their experiment,
all participants were exposed to both nature and built images in a within-subjects design.
Herein, the environment type defined independent groups.
LPP-L. There was a significant LPP-L difference between the nature and built
experimental groups without any significant effects of ROI (or channel), condition, or
stimulus, with participants in the nature experimental group showing greater LPP-L
activation than in the built experimental group. This finding suggests that valence was
generally higher in the nature stimuli and emotional processing was taking place
throughout the stimulus presentation which ended at 2000 ms, albeit the difference was
small and close to baseline measurements. Several studies have shown previously that
emotional processing of stimuli, as shown by LPP, can continue to occur as long as the
stimulus is present (Hajcak & Foti, 2020; Liu, Huang, McGinnis-Deweese, Keil, & Ding,
2012; MacNamara et al., 2011).

70
LPP Summary. LPP is an even less temporally defined component than p3. That
is, as an indicator of ongoing emotional processing and arousal following the p3, it can be
measured for several seconds after stimulus onset. Studies have found that as long as the
stimulus is present, this processing can continue at significant amplitude difference from
baseline (Hajcak & Foti, 2020). The binning of the LPP into smaller time windows, such
as LPP-E and LPP-L herein, allows differences in amplitude along the overall time
window to not be washed out in averaging. For example, differences were seen in the
present study during LPP-E between channels, but between groups during LPP-L. At
least one study has even used 90 ms bins with start times 100 ms apart to break the LPP
into 11 windows from 310 ms to 1400 ms (Diedrich, Naumann, Maier, Becker, &
Bartussek, 1997). Most LPP research divides the window into larger bins starting
between 400-600 ms post stimulus onset and going up to 5000 ms (Hajcak & Foti, 2020;
Liu, Huang, McGinnis-Deweese, Keil, & Ding, 2012; MacNamara et al., 2011; O’hare,
Atchley, & Young, 2017).
The finding that LPP-E showed difference between channels, but not conditions
or groups, but LPP-L showed difference between nature and built experimental groups,
suggests that the emotional and arousal provoking content of nature scenes continues to
be processed longer than that of built scenes. Because this difference did not emerge
between HR and LR scenes, it is more difficult to interpret. Had a restorativeness level
difference been found, it could be attributed to differences in the subcomponents of
restorativeness that may lend to a scene’s pleasantness. That said, in the present study,
the scenic stimuli from both nature and built experimental groups were rated by
experimental participants and averaged according to both their naturalness category and

71
their restorativeness level (HR-N, LR-N, HR-B, and LR-B). The main effects across
these four stimulus categories on subjective ratings of perceived restorativeness and
dimensions of subjective preference showed that the HR-N and LR-N scenes were greater
in subjectively rated valence and mental arousal than their restorativeness-respective built
scenes. LPP primarily indicates stimulus valence and arousal out to 5000 ms post
stimulus onset(Hajcak & Foti, 2020; Liu, Huang, McGinnis-Deweese, Keil, & Ding,
2012; MacNamara et al., 2011; O’hare, Atchley, & Young, 2017).
Support for Hypotheses
For the four stated hypotheses for the present study, support was mixed.
Hypothesis 1 stated that targets in HR blocks would show greater p3 amplitude and
earlier latency than targets in LR or Br blocks. However, it was found that HR standard
stimuli, not targets, showed this difference from LR and Br standards, showing that
stimuli rated as HR also showed neurophysiological evidence of being more attentionally
restorative as well.
Hypothesis 2 stated that target RTs would be faster, and block error counts fewer,
in HR blocks compared to LR and Br blocks. These behavioral measures did not show
differences between conditions or between groups. The ERP results did not show clearly
improved performance on targets for HR over LR or Br. Because responding was not
appropriate for standard stimuli (there were false alarms, but not that significantly
differed between conditions or groups), any restorative effects on standard stimulus
processing were not documented behaviorally in this study.
Hypothesis 3 stated that an interaction effect of naturalness and restorativeness on
LPP amplitude would be observed. While there was not an interaction of these factors

72
affecting LPP, LPP-E was different between frontal channels and O2. Also, the LPP-L
difference in which the nature experimental group showed greater amplitude than the
built experimental group partly supports this hypothesis, suggesting that nature scenes
were more pleasant and more arousing than built scenes between 1000 ms and 2000 ms
after stimulus onset. This finding is consistent with stimulus ratings from the ERP
sample. Of course, the ratings of the HR-N and HR-B images from the rating sample
were equal because they were the basis for matching the HR stimuli in the N and B
groups. This finding is also consistent with the previously found nature/built LPP
difference (Mahamane et al., 2020).
Finally, Hypothesis 4 stated that the subjective preference ratings would be
greater for HR versus LR scenes, and for N versus B scenes. This is exactly what was
observed for restorativeness and four of the five subjective preference dimensions, with
the exception of physical arousal. HR-N was the highest, followed by HR-B, LR-N, and
LR-B scenes in that order with each category being different from the others.
Naturalness and Restorativeness Conclusions
One main goal of this study was to experimentally delineate the effects of scene
naturalness and restorativeness on attention restoration to better understand how these
aspects of an environment affect cognitive function. While there are limitations regarding
the size of the final analysis sample, some inferences about these factors’ effects on
cognition can be made. The experimental sample rated HR-N higher on perceived
restorativeness than HR-B scenes even though they had been matched for restorativeness
based on ratings from the ratings sample. HR-N scenes were also rated highest in the
subjective preference categories than all other scene types. There was clearly shown a

73
preference of nature over built in our samples. This preference also bore out in the
comparison of LPP-L between nature and built stimuli, as indicative of greater positive
valence and mental arousal.
From the ERP results, conclusions about the effect of restorativeness on
attentional processes in the present study are a bit less clear to draw. HR scenic trials, not
targets, produced greater p3 amplitude and earlier latency than LR scenes and Br
controls. Restorativeness seemed to directly affect processing of the standard stimuli
themselves, rather than the targets immersed in blocks of standards with varying levels of
restorativeness. Thus, an effect of restorativeness on attentional processing as shown by
p3 characteristics was found, but not as hypothesized, nor as the paradigm would suggest
based on previous research. Traditionally, in oddball tasks, both active and passive, p3
amplitude is significantly greater for target trials than standard trials (Polich, 1989;
Polich, 2007; Polich, 2012; Polich et al., 1989).

CHAPTER V
LIMITATIONS, FUTURE DIRECTIONS, AND IMPLICATIONS
Sample Size
The main limitation of the findings presented herein is the ERP sample not
reaching the targeted size. Only 39 of the ERP participants run were able to be used in
analyses after data preprocessing. Further, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic halted the
collection of more data to achieve the 96 total participants targeted. However, several
significant interactions and effects were detected using mixed ANOVA’s. The sizes of
these effects were mostly small, suggesting that they would likely increase in size with a
larger sample as small effects are more difficult to detect with small samples. Though it
must be acknowledged that with a much larger sample, as originally planned, the nature
of the present results could also change.
Stimuli, Presentation, and p3 Elicitation
The paradigms in both the study reported by Mahamane and colleagues (2020)
and the present study did not show a traditional p3 effect. In the former, all participants
viewed both nature and built stimuli in two counterbalanced blocks that differed by
which scenic category served in the standard role (80% frequency) and the target role
(20% frequency). However, single images were not used repeatedly in these roles in each
block. Instead, the experimental program pulled stimuli from nature and built stimulus
pools at the appropriate frequencies for each block. So, stimuli within each category were
also very diverse and likely why a p3 effect was not found in that study.
The present study responded to this limitation by having any one participant only
see one scenic image as the standard for each block and using non-scenic geometric

75
pattern images as targets, so that targets are not even in the “scenic” category as were all
standards. Also, the standard frequency was increased to 90% and the target frequency
was reduced to 10% from the previous study. Finally, the present study was an active
oddball task that instructed participants to respond to target stimuli rather than passively
view the stimuli as a slideshow. However, with these changes, a strong target p3 was still
not elicited. Instead, standard p3 amplitude in the HR conditions was higher than target
amplitude in the same conditions. The most likely explanation is that with the inherent
fascination and extensiveness of the scenic standards, according to the components on
ART on which the HR scenes were highly rated, stimulus processing required more
attentional resources (greater p3 amplitude), but less effortfully as these components
naturally engage exogenous attention (earlier latency).
Regarding the content of the stimuli, it is important to note that all of the HR-B
stimuli contained many natural constituents in the researcher’s own qualitative
assessment. For example, more than one image contained houses along a beachfront. One
image contained a cabin surrounded by a snowy forest. Thus, while the stimuli were
selected based on their categorization rates on naturalness and their ratings of perceived
restorativeness, the elements that led participants to rate these scenes as highly restorative
may have been the natural elements and thus whether naturalness and restorativeness
were actually separated could be questioned. For example, the aforementioned cabin
scene could be rated highly on the “being away” component due to the remote, forested
location of the “built” cabin. This conundrum begs the question of whether naturalness
and restorativeness can possibly be separate factors in any pure way.

76
Future ERP research using visually complex scenic stimuli in oddball paradigms
to compare p3 topography between conditions should systematically test under what
presentation conditions greater target p3 compared to standards are evoked. Based on the
findings of the present study, a logical next step would be to reverse the roles of the
geometric and scenic stimuli. The scenic standards in the present study were found to
evoke greater, earlier p3 amplitude than the targets in their blocks. Switching the roles of
these images in the experiment would test whether the content of a current image has
more to do with the p3 characteristics in its associated ERP than the features of the
standard images within which it is immersed. The present study used the immersive
approach because ART research has set a precedent for long restorative stimulus
presentation before testing (Berman et al., 2008; Berto, 2005, 2007; Berto et al., 2015;
Gamble et al., 2014; Li et al., 2020; Taylor & Kuo, 2008, 2011). Thus, this was the
logical approach to attempt replication of ART findings while incorporating ERP
methodology to provide a neurophysiological assessment as well.
Future Between-Groups Investigations
It is known that habituation tends to occur after several instances of target
presentation (Lammers et al, 1989; Polich, 1989). While habituation proposes minimal
threat due to the controlled sequence paradigm, the present study counterbalanced block
order to also control for fatigue and/or carry-over. However, carry-over effects would be
interesting to examine in the future. Even though an effect of order was observed in some
analyses, the largely uneven participant numbers between block orders increases the
likelihood that these effects are spurious and analyzing these data for carry-over effects
would not be valid. To test for carryover of attention restoration to subsequent block

77
performance, a future replication should use a between-groups design to explore the
longevity of attention restoration by having participants complete several successive
blocks in the same restoration condition to compare any neurophysiologically and
behaviorally evident performance declines, over time, and between conditions.
Also, as described above, the proposed study approaches attention restoration in
the context of an “attention improvement during immersion” model, versus recovery
from a fatigued state; and there is precedent for such an effect (Berto, et al. 2015;
Tennessen & Cimprich, 1995). However, p3 and LPP modulation by attention restoration
after fatigue should also be studied using a between-groups design in which participants
are fatigued by an attention-demanding task prior to completing oddball task blocks with
HR-N, HR-B, LR-N, LR-B, or control standard stimuli. Importantly, Boksem, Meijman,
and Lorist (2006) found that P3 amplitude was not decreased, but latency did increase
after they induced mental fatigue in their participants. However, Lorist, Boksem, and
Ridderinkhof (2005) found in a similar task, with respect to difficulty and duration, that
time-on-task did not affect p3 amplitude or latency. Thus, there is need to further explore
p3 and mental fatigue, and especially how the relationship is affected by restorative and
natural scene characteristics.
p3a vs. p3b
Often the p3 is thought of as having two general subcomponents: p3a (an earlier,
more dramatic elicitation in response to unexpected, task-irrelevant stimuli) and p3b
(analogous to the traditional p3 and a response to rare, task-relevant, target stimuli as
measured herein; Polich, 2007, 2012). Given that ART functions via a mechanism
defined by the switch to exogenous from endogenous attention, the p3a and p3b

78
subcomponents should map onto those, respectively. Applying this idea to investigations
of p3 within the ART framework could be illuminating and should be pursued at some
point following this study. However, inclusion of that dimension herein would have been
premature as the soundest method of systematically developing this line of work was to
search first for modulation of p3 (p3b) via restoration, and then investigate the
delineation of p3a from p3b within the ART framework. And, given that p3 elicitation in
this study was not typical of an active oddball paradigm, those issues described above
should be addressed first before introducing another level of complexity.
Passive tasks often show a p3 elicitation more similar to the p3a because there are
not instructions giving task relevance to any of the stimuli. Three-stimulus active tasks, in
which there is a rare, non-target distracter, are traditionally used to elicit both p3a and
p3b for comparison. The rare, non-target distracter would involuntarily engage
exogenous attention while the rare, task-relevant target would be detected when
participants’ endogenous attention is engaged. Thus, such a paradigm could serve future
ERP investigations of ART well by representing both modes of attention. Or, a paradigm
in which a two-stimulus passive task (p3a; exogenous attention engaged) displaying
restorative standard stimuli precedes a two-stimulus active task (p3b; endogenous
attention engaged) may show facilitation of the active task as evidenced by increased p3b
amplitude and decreased latency. Such work could potentially lead to a reliable, tangible
method of confirming attention restoration occurrence in future paradigms, or even
applied interventions.
Other Populations

79
Having initiated a foundation for this work with the present study, the significant
effects shown should be explored in other populations known to have differences in their
capacity for directed attention from neurotypical Western adults. p3 differences are
documented in a wide range of demographically and/or clinically distinct populations
including neurotypical children (Pfueller et al., 2011) and children and adults with
ADHD (Barry, Johnstone, & Clarke, 2003; Szuromi, Czobor, Komlósi, & Bitter, 2011).
ART has been studied in children with ADHD (Taylor & Kuo, 2008, 2011). Attempts to
replicate any significant effects of restorative images on p3 and LPP characteristics from
neurotypical adult studies in these populations could shed light on the mechanistic nature
of attention restoration in people with ADHD and other conditions characterized by
attention deficits.
For example, do people with ADHD have more sensitive exogenous attention
mechanisms than neurotypical controls, or are they simply unimpaired in that capacity
compared to their own for endogenous attention? In a three-stimulus active oddball task
as described above, but in which the distracter is very similar to an HR standard image
except for one particular detail, the degree to which such distracters elicit p3a
components in adults and children with ADHD, compared to controls, could be assessed.
Another condition would involve a two-stimulus passive task to then compare p3a’s
when there is an active task (three-stimulus). It would be expected in the three-stimulus
active task, versus the two-stimulus passive, that people with ADHD would elicit equally
strong and timed p3a’s between the two paradigms (showing their typical impaired
performance and smaller p3b’s versus controls on the active task). In contrast,
neurotypical controls should show p3a amplitude attenuation and latency increase under

80
suppression of the default mode network (DMN), a rest mode network of cortical and
limbic structures that is active during less demanding tasks and in which activity is
suppressed during more demanding tasks in neurotypical individuals (i.e. effective
directed attention functioning; Raichle & Snyder, 2007). Alternatively, the ADHD
sample would show greater p3a amplitude, and earlier latency, compared to controls in
both paradigms. Significant differences between groups in such a direction would suggest
that just-noticeable-difference thresholds are differently – perhaps more – fine-tuned in
people with ADHD than neurotypical people, but only when detected exogenously.
Finally, if these effects emerged, how might they be moderated by restorativeness and
naturalness of an immersive environment or photographic experimental stimuli?
Theoretical Implications
In conclusion, this work has demonstrated neurophysiological correlates of
attention restoration but, in doing so, has raised the need to bridge ART with Polich’s
(2007) theoretical model of p3 elicitation in which the attentional resources required to
produce p3 are a direct function of arousal level. ART explains, however, that the
mechanisms requiring those resources must rest during exogenous attentional
engagement so that the resources may replenish, with no specific mention of arousal.
Greater p3 amplitude found for restorative standard stimuli suggests that attention
restoration results in greater arousal that, according to Polich (2007), underlies the
attentional resources needed for directed attention during an active discrimination task.
However, Roe and colleagues’ (2013) findings that natural environments (restorativeness
was not assessed) lowered arousal introduce some confusion to this hypothesis. It seems
that “arousal” in Polich’s model may be relevant to, though simply unmentioned in, ART.

81
The arousal ratings obtained in the present study, when combined with observed p3
characteristics, do shed some light on the relationship between arousal and attention
restoration. But, future investigation is ultimately needed to experimentally inform
updates of these existing theories.
