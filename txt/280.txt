Summary
Aims of the study A brain-Computer Interface aims at restoring communication and control in severely
disabled people by identification and classification of EEG features such as Event Related Potentials (ERPs).
The aim of this study is to compare different EEG recording modalities for extraction of ERPs. The first
comparison evaluates the performance of six disc electrodes with that of the Emotiv headset, while the
second evaluates three different electrode types (disc, needle, and large squared electrode).
Material and methods Ten healthy volunteers gave informed consent and were randomized to try the
traditional EEG system (6 disc electrodes with gel and skin preparation) or the Emotiv headset first.
Together with the six disc electrodes, a needle and a square electrode of larger surface were
simultaneously recording near lead Cz. Each modality was evaluated over three sessions of auditory P300
separated by one hour.
Results No statically significant effect was found for the electrode type, nor was the interaction between
electrode type and session number. There was no statistically significant difference of performance
between the Emotiv and the six traditional EEG disc electrodes, although there was a trend showing worse
performance of the Emotive headset. However, the Modality-Session interaction was highly significant
(p<0.001) showing that, while the performance of the 6 disc electrodes stay constant over sessions, the
performance of the Emotiv headset drops dramatically between 2 and 3 hours of use. Finally, the
evaluation of comfort by participants revealed an increasing discomfort with the Emotiv headset starting
with the second hour of use.
Conclusion Our study does not recommend the use of one modality over another based on performance
but suggests the choice should be made on more practical considerations such as the expected length of
use, the availability of skilled labor for system setup and above all, the patient experience.

Résumé
Objectifs de l’étude Les interfaces Cerveau-Ordinateur ont pour vocation la restauration de la
communication et du contrôle chez les patients lourdement handicapés, via l’utilisation de caractéristiques
EEG telles que les Potentiels Evoqués (PE). L’objectif de cette étude est la comparaison de différentes
modalités d’enregistrement du signal EEG pour l’extraction des PE. Une première comparaison évalue la
performance de six électrodes cupules avec celle d’un casque Emotiv, tandis qu’une seconde compare trois
différents types d’électrodes (cupules, aiguilles et carrés de surface plus large).
Matériels et méthodes Dix volontaires sains ont donné leur consentement éclairé avant d’être randomisés
pour essayer en premier, soit le système EEG traditionnel (six électrodes cupules avec gel et préparation de
la peau), soit le casque Emotiv. Avec les six électrodes cupules, une aiguille et une électrode carrée de
surface plus importante ont été utilisées près de Cz pour enregistrer simultanément l’activité EEG. Chaque
modalité a été évaluée lors de trois sessions séparées d’une heure.
Résultats Aucune différence statistiquement significative n’a été trouvé, ni pour le type d’électrode, ni pour
l’interaction entre le type d’électrode et la session. Il n’y a pas de différence significative entre le casque
Emotiv et les six électrodes traditionnelles bien que la tendance montre de moindres performances pour le
casque. L’interaction Modalité-Session s’est cependant révélée fortement significative (p<0.001) ce qui
s’explique par une baisse des performances du casque Emotiv entre la seconde et troisème heure
d’utilisation. Enfin, l’évaluation du confort par les participants révèle une gêne importante associée à
l’utilisation du casque Emotiv à partir de la seconde heure d’utilisation.
Conclusion Notre étude ne recommande pas l’utilisation d’une technique plutôt qu’une autre sur la base
seule des performances mais suggère plutôt que ce choix soit dirigé par des considérations plus pratiques
telles que durée attendue d’utilisation, disponibilité de personnel qualifié pour l’installation du système et
surtout, le confort du patient.

Introduction
A Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a direct communication pathway between the brain and an
external device [1, 2]. The idea is challenging and involves sending discrete command to a device
solely relying on the on-line analysis of brain signal, which completely bypasses the usual
muscular and peripheral nerves output. Although first attempts concerned healthy users [3, 4]
the research in BCI filed has flourished in the 90s promoted by its potential use in restoring
communication pathway for patients with severe motor disabilities, like spinal cord injuries or
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [5]. The quality of the EEG signal is of paramount importance to
achieve a good BCI performance. Unfortunately, traditional gel-based sensors setup requires
skilled technicians, is time consuming, and users’ hair and electrodes have to be cleaned after
use. It is therefore well recognized that one important improvement for the usability of BCIs
would be the use of an easy-to-setup and no-gel-based head-mounted device.

Recently, several EEG recording devices with such characteristics have been proposed in the
market. Because of low consumer price, wireless connection and the relatively high number of
electrodes (14) the Emotiv headset (Emotiv, EPOC, Hong-Kong, HK) is particularly interesting [6].
It has been designed for gaming applications and therefore offers several advantages over
traditional gel-based systems. In particular, electrodes are attached on a semi-rigid support, as
seen on Figure 1, so that electrode positioning, while less accurate, is much faster. Emotiv
headset has become increasingly popular in BCI community [7-10] and has already successfully
been involved in several BCI designs [9, 11, 12]. Actual comparisons of the Emotiv Headset to
more traditional EEG amplifier have already been reported for EEG recording [13] and Event
Related Potentials (ERPs) extractions [14] indicating worse performance of the Emotiv Headset.

These studies were however not quantitative and a formal comparisons is necessary. In
particular, it is unclear how quickly the signal quality drops does while the felt pads are drying.

It has been showed that P300 ERPs can be used to select items displayed on a computer monitor
with and may be able to provide a new communication channel to patients suffering from severe
neurological or muscular disorders [15, 16]. These authors used a visual oddball paradigm,
consisting in a 6x6 matrix where rows and columns are flashed at random. A complete repetition
of flashes consists in all columns and rows flashing once (12 flashes total). Any of the 36 cells
constituted potential targets, and is therefore flashed twice, once in its column and once in its
row. These two rare events elicit a P300 response that can be identified with adequate
algorithms. This paradigm was successfully tested with patients suffering from Amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS) [17, 18] showing a stable P300 response. These results have been replicated
several times [19, 20].

The P300 auditory event-related (endogenous) potentials (ERPs) were first described by Sutton et
al. [21]. This positive component peaking 300 ms or later is elicited with a simple discrimination
task, named “oddball paradigm”. In this task, two stimuli (tones) are presented in a random series
such that one of them occurring relatively infrequently is the “oddball”. The subject has to
distinguish between the tones by noting the occurrence of the target (pressing a button, mentally
counting…) and not responding to the standard. In most cases, the frontal (Fz), central (Cz) and
parietal (Pz) midline electrodes referenced at mastoids or earlobes have been used to obtain
P300 potentials. A total of 200 stimuli randomly presented are classically used. The ERP are then
averaged to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The P300 potential is physiologically defined as the
largest positive peak after the N100-P200-N200 complex within a latency window defined by the

sensory modality: auditory=250-450ms and visual=300-600ms. The P300 component is
characterized by its amplitude (size) and latency (timing). Amplitude (μV) is defined as the voltage
difference between the component peak and the pre-stimulus baseline. Latency (ms) is defined as
the time from stimulus onset to the point of maximum positive amplitude of the ERP waveform
occurring after the earlier exogenous components (N100, P200, N200).

The aim of this study is to compare different modalities of EEG recording for extraction of P300
ERPs. In a first experiment, the Emotiv headset was compared to a standard EEG recording
system. In a second experiment, three different types of electrodes were compared. Comparison
considered ease of use, comfort, setup time and ability to discriminate P300 target from nontarget responses.

Materials and Methods
Participants
Participants were adult healthy volunteers of both gender recruited among nurses and research
staff. Exclusion criteria were cognitive, eyesight or hearing deficit, history of epilepsy, pregnancy
and people under judicial protection or without social security. The protocol received approval
from both the local ethical board (Comité de Protection des Personnes, Saint-Germain-en-Laye,
France) and the French regulatory agency (ANSN) and was conducted in compliance with good
clinical guidelines and Helsinki declaration [22]. All participants included in the study gave their
written informed consent.

Study Design
This study design was a randomized crossed-over pilot study with half-a-day wash out period. The
main objective of the study is to compare different modalities for the characterization and
classification of ERPs. Table I describes the modalities compared and reports the comparison
criteria used.

Subjects were randomized (single block) to try DISC (six traditional disc electrodes) or EMOTIV
(Emotiv headset) first. As detailed in Figure 2, the evaluation lasted half-a-day with three sessions
separated by exactly an hour. Two evaluations for the same participant could not happen over
two consecutive half-days.

DISC and EMOTIV were compared over two different sessions while electrodes dE (disc), nE
(needle) and sE (squared of larger surface) are compared during the same session. Each
evaluation was organized as follow:
1

Electrodes are set up by an experienced EEG technician (5-20 min);

2

The task is explained to the participant (5 min);

3

(3 times) Evaluation of the modality (15 min) + 1 hour break;

An analog visual scale (AVS, from 0 for “very uncomfortable” to 10 for “very confortable”) was
used to estimate the comfort during modality setup (before S0) and at the end of each session
(S1, S2 and S3). Installation time was also recorded from case opening to beginning of the
recording for each modality.

EEG recording
For Experiment I, the first modality (DISC) consisted of six standard silver/silver chloride disc
electrodes (diameter = 10mm, surface =

, Pactronic, France) that were set up at

standard 10/20 locations Fz, Cz, Pz, Oz, PO3 and PO7 [23-25]. An abrasive paste (Nu-Prep Gel,
Weaver and Company, Aurora, CO, USA) was applied to the scalp prior electrode positioning with
a conductive paste (Tensive, Parker laboratories, USA). The impedance between the reference
and each electrode was kept below 5 kOhms. Electrodes were connected to a g.MOBIlab+ (G.Tec,
Guger Technologies, Graz, Austria) sampling EEG signals at 256 samples per seconds via a 16 bit
A/D converter. The potential of all electrodes was referenced to the right mastoid. The left
mastoid was used as ground. The amplifier was connected to a desktop computer (CPU: 2.4GHz,
4Go DDRMA2) running the OpenViBE open-source platform [26] (release 0.12.0-svn3107). For the
second modality (EMOTIV), the Emotiv headset (Figure 1) [6] was set up front-side-back to allow
collection of signals located rather in the parietal and occipital areas instead of frontal: the 14
single-use felt pads were irrigated with a 7% saline solution and approximately located at the
extended 10/20 locations Fp1, F7, CP5, T5, P3, PO3, Fp2, F8, T4, CP6, P4, T6 and PO4 . The Emotiv
headset uses a Common Mode Sense (CMS) electrode at F4 location and a Driven Right Leg (DRL)
electrode at F3 that can be related to the ground and reference in more traditional acquisition
systems. Electrodes impedances were controlled visually with the Emotiv Control Panel so that all
sensors show “green”. Signals are internally digitized at 2048Hz (16-bit) and subsequently low
pass filtered (43Hz) and down sampled to 128Hz before transmission to the acquisition module.
The headset was connected wirelessly to a laptop (HP ProBook; Microsoft Windows 7
Professional SP1 32 bits; CPU: IntelCore i5 Dual Core m430 at 2.27GHz, Memory: DDR3 2Go) and
interfacing OpenViBE platform.

For Experiment II, the following recording modalities were compared: a standard silver/silver
chloride disc (diameter = 10mm, surface =

, Pactronic, France) located at Cz, a

silver/silver chloride needle electrode and a large silver/silver chloride square electrode
(20x15mm, surface =

, Pactronic, France) located at one centimeter from Cz on the right

and left, respectively. Signals were recorded together with the DISC modality in Experiment I.

Auditory stimuli generation
For all comparisons, each session consisted of 20 independent blocks of one hundred stimulations
at 5Hz: target (0.5kHz 0.1s-long beeps) and non-target stimuli (1kHz 0.1s-long beeps). To keep
concentration high, participants were asked to note down the number of target stimuli they
identified, while in each block was randomly populated with 15±2 target stimuli. In total, each
session consisted of 1700 non-target and 300 target stimuli.

EEG pre-processing
Raw EEG signals were stored as GDF format [27] with the type and location of auditory
stimulations. For further data analysis, all EEG data were band-pass filtered between 0.01 and 30
Hz by means of Butterworth 4th order filters.

For each session, the data consisted of a matrix

, respectively indicating the temporal location (in number of

sample from session start) and the type of stimulus (0 for non-target and 1 for target).

Cross-validation
For each session, the
equal size (

stimulations were split into five independent and random groups of
) to allow a 5-fold cross-validation procedure. The K-fold validation is a

standard technique used to estimate the variability of a result [28]. At each fold, a fifth of the
data (

) is left aside for model validation (the “validation” set) while the remaining (

) is used for model fitting (the “training set’). At the end of this procedure, every observation
has been used once and only once to estimate the performance of model (described below). For
each fold, the training data was used to estimate the weights
coefficients

of a spatial filter and the

for a linear classifier, according to a procedure detailed below. These were

subsequently applied to each test set in order to estimate the overall model performance on
unseen data.

Spatial filter
A spatial filter derives a waveform by linearly weighting the potential at each electrode. Spatial
filters are designed to enhance interesting features of the data while suppressing the rest [29]. A
few spatial filters are typically enough to describe the features of interests, thus the use of spatial
filtering dramatically reduces the dimensionality of EEG data. Furthermore, spatial filters can be
designed to output non-correlated waveforms, thus the classifier is provided with non-redundant
data. The xDAWN algorithm [30] is a spatial filter that optimizes spatial weights

to enhance the

Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) for ERPs elicited during and oddball paradigm. The filters are sorted by
SNR enhancement ratio. The spatial filters were computed on the training data and applied to the
validation set. Only the first three components of the xDAWN matrix were used, resulting in three
spatial filters.

Number of repetitions
The most commonly used technique to improve SNR in ERP analysis is that of averaging; it consist
in presenting the same type of stimulus

over all presentations [33]. To study the relation between the number of repetitions and the
classifier performance for each modality, averaged responses were generated for a number of
repetition going from

target and

non-target responses from the 80 target and 320 non-target responses present in the

For each stimulus, a one-second time-window starting at the stimulation trigger was extracted for
target and non-target stimuli for the three electrodes of interest (at Cz). ERPs were averaged
within each session, resulting in two waveforms for each electrode, for each session and for each
participant. Modalities were compared using the root mean square difference (RMSd) after signal
normalization, computed such as

where is the electrode index, is the sample number,
response window, and

and

sample for electrode for the target

and non-target response, respectively.

Statistical analysis
For Experiment I we conducted the following tests:
●

the AUROC was ranked and used as a dependent variable in a non-parametric repeated
measure ANOVA using permutation methods [35] to account for data non-normality ;
Modality (EMOTIV or DISC) and session number were used as crossed-over random
factor; the 5-fold and the number of repetitions (

were defined as

nested random factors (at each session);
●

Difference in satisfaction at installation and after sessions 1, 2 and 3, were tested with an
ANOVA with modality and session number as the two repeated-measure factors [35-37];

●

Comparison of setup time for the two modalities was compared with a paired t-test.

For all statistical tests the tolerance for type I error was set to 0.05. All analyses were performed
using Matlab (Version 8.0.0.783 - R2012b) and toolboxes referenced in this section.

For Experiment II, the RMS of the difference (RMSd) was used as a dependent variable in a
repeated measure ANOVA with electrode type (disc, needle, or square) and session number as
repeated-measure factor. The repeated measures ANOVA uses a multivariate framework
(Hotelling T-square) that automatically account for correlation between measures [37] and
therefore does not need to account for sphericity [36].

Results
Subject
Ten healthy volunteer aged 24 to 58 (mean 36.3±12.2), five male (50%), were included in the
study after giving informed consent.

Waveform analysis
Table II summarizes means latencies of the recorded P300 responses of each participant during
each session as well as session’s means. These data ranges are consistent with those existing in
the literature [38]. Furthermore, analysis of P300 responses for each participant revealed a
significant relation between P300 latencies and ages of the subjects (p=0.02) [39] that can be
described with the following equation:

. Figure 3 (Top) plots the

grand averages P300 responses recorded during each one of the three sessions for all the 10

studied subjects using each type of electrode. Figure 3 (Bottom) represented computed scalp
topographic mapping of P300 responses peak amplitude. Table III shows average P300 peak
amplitude data for the three electrode types used (dE, sE and nE) for all participants across the
three different sessions.

Experiment I: Comparison of EMOTIV and DISC
Table IV presents the results from the non-parametric analysis of variance comparing the
performance of the 6 disc electrodes (DISC) and the Emotiv Headset. (EMOTIV) The modality
factor was not found to be statistically significant although there is a trend for the Emotiv headset
to provide worse results as illustrated in Figure 4. The Session factor and Modality-Session
interaction were significant, as seen in Table IV, and reflects the drop in performance for the
Emotiv headset between sessions two and three that can be observed in Figure 4.

It took on average 26.3±4.6 minutes to setup 6 standard disc electrodes against 11.5±3.5 minutes
for the Emotiv headset (t(9)=7.5; p<0.001). Figure 5 presents the evolution of comfort rated by
participants at installation and after each session for the Emotiv headset and the set of 8
electrodes (including the square and the needle electrodes).

For comparison of comfort, modality, session and modality-session interaction were all found to
be statistically significant factors as seen in Table V. This means that the Emotiv headset
significantly is less comfortable than the disc electrodes and also that its comfort decreases with
time.

Issues mentioned by participants for DISC included an unpleasant feeling during the needle
electrode setup (5/10) and an itchy feeling from the nat (3/10). Eight complained of severe pain
while using the Emotiv headset after an hour; they mentioned a “painful” temporal pressure
(6/10), frontal (1/10) or a “severe radiating pain in the jaw” (1/10).

Experiment II: Comparison of modalities dE, nE and sE
Figure 6 shows the evolution of RMSd over three sessions for electrode type dE, nE and sE. It
shows that all electrode types provide similar performance over the three sessions. The ANOVA
show statistically significance for none of the factors nor their interaction.

Discussion
Waveform analysis
Amplitudes, latencies, waveforms as well as scalp topographic distribution of auditory P300
responses recorded in this study are largely in accordance with those reported in the literature
[23-25]. Interestingly, the well-known correlation between age of subject and P300 latency was
noticed in this study [39].

Experiment I: Comparison of EMOTIV and DISC
Results show that there is no overall statistically significant difference in ERP extraction between
the six standard disc electrodes and the 14 wet electrodes from the Emotiv headset even though

there is a trend for the Emotiv to provide worse results, as reported in previous studies [12-14].
The fact that Modality is not significant can be explained by the large variability of results with the
Emotiv headset that can be observed in Figure 4. The Modality-Session interaction factor was
however found significant suggesting that the signal from the Emotiv headset degrades much
faster over time. This phenomenon is illustrated on the right hand side of Figure 4, which shows
poorer performance for the Emotiv headset (green) after two hours, together with a much wider
variability amongst participants.

Fundamental differences in the design of the two recording modalities can explain the better
performance of the traditional EEG system. First of all, Emotiv headset electronic specifications
(noise or entry impedance) are unknown and are likely to underperform the one of the Gtech
MOBILab amplifier that was designed for electrophysiological studies and not gaming and
entertainment. Then, Emotiv raw EEG signals are transferred wirelessly for processing and
storage, which possibly involves packet loss (even though the receptor was located as near as
possible to the headset) and further software corrections. Electrode location can also account for
lack of discriminatory power, since the current headset does not cover well the central-parietal
area. This could however easily be corrected in future design of headset. Finally, the electrode
type (wet felt pads with no skin preparation) likely accounts for the largest part of the difference.
In particular, wet electrode drying is a plausible mechanism to explain the poor performance of
the Emotiv headset in the final session.

On the other hand, the one-meter long non-shielded cable used to connect disc electrodes to the
MOBILab amplifier constitutes an important source of electromagnetic noise, while the Emotiv
headset digitizes signals nearly on-site. Also, the Emotiv headset benefits from a larger number of

electrodes (14 against 6), which favors good performance of the spatial filter. In particular, it has
been shown that using a spatial filter eight disc electrodes suffice to obtain good performances
[25], but this could be done at the cost of a longer setup time. The analysis was therefore re-run
considering only the 6 best located electrodes available on the Emotiv headset (CP5, P3, PO3, C4,
P4 and PO4) and showed a statistically significant effect of modality (p(MC)<0.05). The difference
in performance can still partly be explained by the different electrode locations though other
aspects of the design reasonably account for a significant part of it.

Indeed, comparing two EEG recording modality aiming at their practical use involves other criteria
than performance only. Setup time can be particularly important, favoring the Emotiv headset
that is more than twice faster to setup (11 against 26 minutes, p<0.001).

The use of the Emotiv headset was unfortunately associated with major discomfort in all but two
participants (80%). All participants however ended the three sessions despite being said they
could drop out at any time. We believe that the source of discomfort was from the two
electrodes directly attached to the C-arm, on which most of the pressure was applied. Even
though such headset offers advantages in terms of ergonomic and ease of use, the pain
associated with its prolonged use makes it inappropriate for patients who cannot express pain,
who are unfortunately some of the patients interested in BCI applications.

Experiment II: Comparison of modalities nE, dE and sE
The RMSd was used instead of the P300 peak amplitude to compare the electrode types for
several reasons. Firstly, the discriminative information in ERP response is spread at different
latencies [40, 41], which would not be captured by the amplitudes at a point in time. Second,

there are some caveats associated with extraction and comparison of ERPs amplitudes [42]
including problems related to scaling [43] and sensitivity to noise, which are circumvented by
using the RMSd approach.

Results suggest that all three traditional electrodes located at Cz provide equivalent performance
over the three sessions, which confirms that needle electrode provide equivalent performance to
disc electrodes [44]. Similarly, the squared electrode offering a larger surface of contact does not
outperform the traditional disc electrode. We conclude that for P300 studies lasting up to two
hours, there is no clear advantage in term of signal quality of one modality over another. The
choice of recording modality is therefore left to practical consideration such as patient comfort
and setup time. In particular, needle electrodes, despite a short installation time, should not be
used in quadriplegic patients, potential BCIs users, who often develop scalp hyper-sensibility.

Conclusion
The aim of our study was to compare different modalities for extraction of ERPs during an
auditory oddball paradigm. The first experiment compares the Emotiv headset with six gel-based
disc electrodes: it shows no overall statistically significant difference between the two modalities
although there is a trend for the Emotiv headset to provide worse performance. Our results also
suggest that signals from the Emotiv headset degrade significantly between the second and third
hour of use. On average, the setup time for the Emotiv headset was twice shorter. Finally, the
Emotiv headset was associated with an important discomfort in eight participants after an hour.
The second experiment compares three types of electrodes (discs, needle and squared with larger
surface) showing no clear advantage of one technique over another. To conclude, results from

this study highlight benefits and pitfalls for each modality without clear winner: the choice of
modality should be decided on a case-by-case basis given: expected time of use, the availability of
skilled technicians for setup, desired performance and above all patient’s comfort. In a clinical
context however we discourage the use of the Emotiv headset for BCI as it potentially can be
painful. We believe our results can guide the design of future EEG headsets.
