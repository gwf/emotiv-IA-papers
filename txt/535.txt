This research investigated the inﬂuence of advertisement (ad) duration and key elements (titles, logos, and texts) on advertising
eﬀectiveness in mobile feeds. We recruited 40 participants (27 men and 13 women) who are aged from 20 to 43 years (M � 29.33,
SD � 6.67). The participants were assigned randomly to four groups to watch four diﬀerent types of ads: 6-second ads with key
elements, 15-second ads with key elements, 15-second ads without key elements, and 30-second ads without key elements. We
measured advertising eﬀectiveness from four aspects: users’ attention, emotion, memory, and attitudes. During the experiment, a
researcher recorded participants’ electroencephalography and eye movements. After the experiment, participants were required to
complete a questionnaire and were interviewed. Results showed that participants felt more positive when watching 6-second
duration ads in mobile feeds than the 15-second and 30-second ads; however, their memory of the ads was worse. The participants
paid more attention to the key elements rather than the content of the ads. This research elucidated the features of native video ads
in mobile feeds and provided some useful suggestions for advertisers who design video ads.

1. Introduction
Mobile feeds involve customized aggregation of web content
from multiple sources on mobile devices. Applications
(apps) such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook generate
feeds according to users’ personal preferences and accurately
push the content to the users. The contents, varying from a
movie trailer to the latest news, are often ordered or grouped
by time and subject and are presented dynamically in a
stream or a list. Users can read the feed at any time to keep
informed of their interests. Because of their customizability
and ﬂexibility, mobile feeds are becoming increasingly
popular in our daily life, and many companies choose to
advertise in users’ mobile feeds.
Native advertising is one of the most popular and effective advertising methods in mobile feeds [1]. Native ads
are designed to minimize disruption to the user’s online
experience, either by increasing its relevance for viewers or
mimicking the surrounding content [2]. Sponsored stories
on Facebook or promoted tweets on Twitter are two good

examples of native advertising. Native ads usually disguise
themselves in a form that matches the format or function of
the user experience on the platform on which they are
displayed [3, 4]. The visual disguise of native ads can reduce
the users’ perceived intrusiveness and advertising avoidance
and increase their willingness to read or watch the ads [5, 6].
Further, with the help of big data and recommendation
algorithms, advertisers will accurately deliver ads of high
content relevance to their target users [7–9], thus increasing
users’ engagement and decreasing the postclick annoyance
eﬀect [3, 10, 11]. Given these advantages, mobile-feed ads are
gaining increasing attention from businesses and in
academia.
Native video ads in mobile feeds are becoming more
common recently due to the popularity of short videos. Most
studies have been focused on native ads presented in the
form of text [3, 4, 12, 13], but native ads in the form of video
have rarely been studied thoroughly. Compared to the native
text ads (such as sponsored stories or promoted tweets),
native video ads enjoy much more media richness [14, 15]

2
but face several shortcomings when applying to mobile
feeds. Firstly, the display area of the mobile video ads is
usually minimal due to the relatively small size of mobile
touchscreens. Most users tend to hold the devices in a
portrait orientation when viewing feeds. Secondly, the duration of the video ads is usually too long for mobile users,
and most are too impatient to watch the entire ad. However,
simply shortening the video duration brings advertising
eﬀectiveness since it would lead to underexposure of the core
elements of the ad [16]. Thirdly, video ads in mobile feeds are
usually played silently, which results in poorer media
richness comparing to traditional video ads [14, 17]. Thus, it
is necessary to improve mobile-feed video ads to compensate
for their shortcomings. One practical approach is to add
some key elements to enhance users’ perception of the ads,
such as enlarging the texts or emphasizing keywords or
logos. However, the eﬀectiveness of these approaches has
rarely been studied before. It is unclear how these approaches regarding duration and key elements may inﬂuence users’ emotions, attention, memory, and attitudes.
This research compared the advertising eﬀectiveness of
mobile-feed video ads of diﬀerent durations and layouts
concerning their key elements. We conducted a betweengroup experiment involving 40 participants who were asked
to view video ads from eight diﬀerent brands while reading
mobile feeds. We measured their attention, emotion,
memory, and attitudes towards the video ads through
various measures, including electroencephalography (EEG),
eye tracking, self-report questionnaires, and interviews. We
aimed to determine an appropriate duration and arrangement of the key elements for mobile-feed video ads.
This research oﬀers three signiﬁcant contributions.
Firstly, we investigated the inﬂuence of duration and key
elements on video ads’ advertising eﬀectiveness in mobile
feeds. Secondly, we proposed a set of methods for studying
advertising eﬀectiveness in mobile feeds; speciﬁcally, we
used EEG, eye tracking, self-report questionnaires, and
interviews to compare advertising eﬀectiveness. Thirdly, this
research helps clarify some preferred features of video ads in
mobile feeds. Moreover, it will also provide some useful
suggestions for advertisers who design video ads.

2. Related Works
Mobile ads refer to ads that are promoted through mobile
devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, or laptops. Unlike
traditional ads like television or newspaper ads, mobile ads
have enjoyed much more media richness and interactivity
owing to the power of new technological devices [18].
Traditional ads are usually presented on a one-way medium,
which means that users can only receive information from
the medium; however, mobile ads involve a two-way interaction. Users can watch or read ads and immediately give
feedback, like deleting the ads or clicking the ads. Consequently, the ad systems can collect users’ preferences and
deliver future ads accordingly through various algorithms
[7–9, 19].
Mobile ads are divided by transmission software medium into four groups: mobile messaging ads, mobile web

Mobile Information Systems
ads, mobile video ads, and mobile app ads [20]. Mobile
messaging usually refers to the ads delivered through short
message services or e-mails. Mobile web ads are pictures,
banners, or links in mobile browsers. Mobile video ads are
advertising videos that are played either before, after, or
during videos. Both web ads and video ads can be embedded
in mobile apps to improve interactivity [21]. In fact, web ads
and video ads are ubiquitous in many mobile apps with
information feeds.
In this research, we focused on video ads, which we
deﬁned as online display ads that have video within them.
Some researchers have found that applying video ads in a
video stream is very eﬀective in web advertising [22, 23].
Viewers’ motivations to watch video ads vary from person to
person, and the ways they watch videos ads are closely
related to their motivations [24]. Motivations such as social
connectedness, relaxation, information, escapism, passing
time, and entertainment encourage users to watch ads. In
addition, some research [24] suggested that advertisers take
advantage of the interactive and participatory nature of the
web apps and develop more accurate ads according to the
interactive characteristics of each media platform. Tradition
video ads also have some disadvantages. Intrusiveness can
prevent users from watching ads. On some occasions, ads
can be very annoying since their forms and content are quite
diﬀerent from the content users are reading or viewing.
Native ads, on the other hand, can reduce intrusiveness
when users view them [2–4]. Many researchers have indicated
native ads’ advantages over traditional mobile ads as the
native ads have higher click-through rates [25–27]. Nevertheless, some researchers argued that the native ads could also
lead to drastic drops in click-value rates because the disguised
nature of native ads is likely to cause users’ annoyance after
they realize that they have been tricked [28, 29]. Users are
likely to feel deceived after clicking on an ad that they initially
thought was an organic listing, particularly when the ads are
presented in low serial positions [3]. However, these discussions were limited in the native ads in text, which need an
extra click to read full contents. Few studies have looked into
native video ads that are automatically played in the information feed without extra clicks.
Contrary to native ads in text, native video ads are
usually perceived as less deceptive. It does not interrupt the
user experience with unnecessary extra clicks, meaning the
content is more likely to be engaged with rather than an
annoying distraction in their feed [30]. Given that users
usually scan the native video ads when rolling down the
feeds, it is particularly crucial for advertisers to rapidly grab
users’ attention and deliver core contents of the video ads
within a limited time. To date, most studies on native advertising [3, 12, 13] have been focused on how users’ recognition of native ads aﬀects their evaluations of the ads and
advertiser [28, 29]. Little work has been devoted to native
video ads’ design principles, especially for the duration and
key elements. This work is essential for practitioners in the
advertising industry to design better video ads of high advertising eﬀectiveness without damaging users’ experience.
It will also shed light on future research regarding native
video ads’ design in the mobile information feed.

Mobile Information Systems
Duration is a key factor that inﬂuences advertising effectiveness. Many researchers found that viewers’ memories
of the ads are strongly related to their exposure time to the
ads [16, 31, 32]. The longer viewers exposed themselves to
the ads, the more possibilities they remembered the contents. Li and Lo [33] conducted an empirical study on the
eﬀect of duration and position of the in-stream video ads. It
was found that longer duration and midroll ads lead to better
brand recognition. Goodrich et al. [16] also found that
longer preroll ads were perceived as less intrusive than the
shorter ads. However, longer ads do not always produce
better results. Krishnan and Sitaraman [22] conducted a
quasiexperiment and found that longer ads were less likely to
be watched to completion than were shorter ads. Ads placed
in the middle of a video were more likely to be watched to
completion than those placed at the beginning or end, which
was also veriﬁed by Li and Lo [33]. One possible explanation
of this phenomenon is that longer ads are more intrusive and
cause users’ avoidance of the ads [16]. Advertising avoidance
refers to “actions that media users take to reduce exposure to
an ad’s content” [34]. Fan et al. [6] found that perceived goal
impediment and perceived ad clutter contributed to the
advertising avoidance. It is worth noting that the users were
more pleasant if they were provided with a “skip” option in
the ads [22] because it increased participants’ attention on
the ads and reduced perceived intrusiveness. Therefore, we
can imply that longer video ads in mobile feeds, which
interrupt users’ reading ﬂow more, are more likely to be
intrusive than shorter videos ads, thereby producing more
unpleasant emotion.
Given that short videos cannot provide enough information, key elements (logo and text) are introduced into the
video ads to compensate for the shortcoming. Previous
research [35–39] found that logo elements and text elements
played an important role in capturing users’ attention.
Pieters and Wedel [38] found that the text element captures
attention in proportion to its size, and the brand element
transfers attention to the other elements eﬀectively. Viswanathan et al. [39] also found that a pictorial logo would
help users remember and understand more of the ad contents. Li et al. [37] found that text in tourism photographs
drew the most visual attention regardless of the text language. They also conﬁrmed that participants are more likely
to be inﬂuenced by texts in the pictorial ads. Thus, we can
imply that users perceived more advertising eﬀectiveness
towards the ads with key elements than the ads without key
elements in mobile feeds.

3. Materials and Methods
3.1. Participants. We recruited 40 participants (27 men and
13 women) through a social network on WeChat. Participants were aged from 20 to 43 years (M � 29.33 years,
SD � 6.67). Half were aged <30 years. Two-thirds (67.5%)
were either students or employees of the authors’ university.
Sixty percent used their mobile phones for more than three
hours per day. Nearly all (92.5%) admitted that they used
social apps daily, which was followed by news apps (55%)
and shopping apps (55%) in prevalence. All participants

3
were right-handed to avoid individual diﬀerences in the
dominant hemisphere [40].
3.2. Experiment Design and Stimuli. The experiment was
conducted with four groups, in which participants viewed
four diﬀerent types of video ads. These ads diﬀered in the
duration and arrangement of their key elements. Each
participant was asked to ﬁnish eight experiment tasks and
view eight diﬀerent ads from eight diﬀerent brands. In each
task, participants were required to read a series of news
feeds, and the ads appeared in the feeds as they scrolled
down the screen. The ads were played automatically without
any sound. The appearance of the native video ads was
similar to the news in the feed, but they were not relevant in
content.
There were two independent variables in this research:
duration and presence of the key elements. The variable
duration had three levels: 6 seconds, 15 seconds, and 30
seconds. Six-second ads were explicitly designed for in-feed
advertising, allowing users to view the entire ad contents in a
very short time, whereas 15- and 30-second ads are more
typical of TV or video website advertisements. Second, key
elements refer to logos and text in the video ads, which had
two levels: with and without key elements (Figure 1).
Four types of video ads were used in the experiment: 6second ads with key elements (M6), 15-second ads with key
elements (M15), 15-second ads without key elements (U15),
and 30-second ads without key element (U30). Except for
the duration and key elements, the four versions were similar
in content. Although our experiment utilized four groups, it
was not a standard orthogonal experimental design. Certain
types of ads (6-second ads without key elements and 30second ads with key elements) were unavailable. It is one of
the limitations of this research; however, there is still value to
our between-group comparisons.
The ads were provided by a Chinese Internet company
that owns one of the most popular news aggregation apps in
China. The content comprised a car ad, a milk powder ad, a
cosmetics ad, an e-commerce ad, a thermos ad, a mineral
water ad, and two mobile phone ads.
3.3. Measurement. Venkatraman et al. [41] proposed a
framework to assess advertising eﬀectiveness. It includes
four core aspects: attention, emotions, memory, and attitudes. Attention, which refers to the ability to attract users’
focus on an ad, is usually measured through participants’
self-reports. However, self-reports cannot distinguish endogenous attention from exogenous attention; therefore,
objective methods like eye tracking are usually applied in
these situations. Our experiment used eye tracking to
measure user’s attention while they read their news feed.
Emotion is deﬁned as the outward expression of emotion
and can be classiﬁed into two dimensions: valence and
arousal, and neurophysiological methods are recommended
to measure participants’ emotions. In the experiment, we
also implemented the Self-Assessment Manikin Scale [42] to
measure participants’ emotions and aﬀection. Memory in
advertising research is usually focused on information

retrieval. More speciﬁcally, two aspects are considered in the
measure of memory: recall and recognition [43]. We used a
questionnaire and interview to measures participants’
memory of the ads presented in the news feed. Lastly, attitudes refer to people’s attitudes and purchase intentions to
the products featured in the ads. Venkatraman argued that
attitudes are likely to be inﬂuenced by people’s preimpression of the brand, and he suggested that applying
neurophysiology would be a promising direction to measure
attitudes. However, it was not practical to measure participants’ emotions and attitudes through neurophysiology
simultaneously in the experiment. We used a questionnaire
and interview to measure participants’ attitudes.
3.3.1. Eye Tracking. Eye tracking has been used in ample
research related to advertising in the past [35, 37, 38]. One
of the advantages of eye tracking is that it can provide a
dynamic trace of a person’s attention [44]. Other eye

movements, such as ﬁxation, can also indicate a person’s
information processes. In our research, we considered
three indicators to describe users’ eye tracking process in
diﬀerent ads: percentage of dwell time in the area (PDT),
ﬁrst ﬁxation time (FFT), and average ﬁxation time (AFT).
PDT refers to the percentage of time that participants
spend viewing the area of interest (AOI) in the total
advertising time. FFT refers to the ﬁrst-time participants’
sight stays at the AOI. AFT refers to the average time that
participants’ ﬁxations fall in the AOI. We divided the infeed video ads into diﬀerent AOIs according to the ad
types. For nonoptimized ads, there were three AOIs,
including the whole ad area, the title area, and the video
area. The tile area shows the basic information about this
video or a slogan. For mobile-optimized ads, a logo area
and a text area were always shown in the ads. It should be
noted that the positions of the texts and the logos were not
ﬁxed in the video. The layouts of the video ads in the news
feed are shown in Figure 2.

The eye movement tracking device used in the experiment was the SMI ETG2W glasses eye tracking system. The
sampling frequency of this device was 60 Hz for both eyes,
and the tracking resolution was 0.1°. The gaze positioning
accuracy was 0.5°, and the tracking range was horizontal 80°
and vertical 60°. The glasses HD lens resolution was
1280 ∗ 960. The ﬁeld of view was horizontal 60° and vertical
45°. The weight of the glasses was 47 g. Participants were
asked to put their chins on a supporter to reduce the eﬀect of
head movement. The experimental platform is shown in
Figure 3.
3.3.2. EEG. In past research, EEG was shown to be a
practical method to measure emotions [45]. Frontal EEG
asymmetry served as a moderator to indicate participants’
valence and arousal in our research. We used an Emotiv
EPOC neuroheadset to collect signals with a 128 Hz sample
rate in 14 channels (AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8,
FC6, F4, F8, and AF4). To reduce the eﬀect of participants’
movement when they were using mobile phones, we ﬁrst
asked participants to view the feed for 3 minutes to record
their base signal.
We measured the valence of emotion by comparing the
asymmetry of the power spectral density in the left and right
frontal lobes. More speciﬁcally, we used the diﬀerential value
between F3 and F4 in the α band as a valence indicator [46]:
α
α
valence � F4 − F3 .
(1)
βF4 βF3
It should be noted that a higher value of valence indicates
more positive emotions; however, the sign of the value
(positive or negative) does not mean the emotion is positive
or negative valence.
In addition, arousal was related to high beta power and
low alpha activity in the parietal lobe [46]. The beta band is

usually related to alertness and excitement, and the alpha
band is typically related to relaxation. It is common practice
to use the alpha/beta ratio as an indicator of a person’s
arousal:
α + αF4 + αAF3 + αAF4
arousal � F3
.
(2)
βF3 + βF4 + βAF3 + βAF4

3.3.3. Questionnaires and Interview. Attitude towards ads
was measured through a questionnaire. The questionnaire
was adapted from Hsiao and Chang’s research [47]. Hsiao
and Chang divide consumers’ attitudes toward ads into six
dimensions: continuance intention, satisfaction, perceived
usefulness, conﬁrmation, perceived value, and perceived
trust. Before the experiment, we measured participants’
initial attitudes to reduce the eﬀect of individual diﬀerences
toward ads. In the following analysis, we include the initial
attitude in the statistical model as a covariate.
After participants viewed each ad, they were asked to
report their attitude concerning three aspects: attitude toward the ad itself, attitude toward the brand, and the product
featured in the ad. Further, participants’ desirability was
measured in the questionnaires by asking their intention to
buy or recommend the products and brands. Questions were
responded to using 7-point Likert scales. Valence and
arousal were measured through the Self-Assessment Manikin Scale [48]. The questionnaire used a pictorial 9-point
instrument to measure participants’ valence and arousal.
Although there are three emotion dimensions in Hodes,
Cook Iii, and Lang’s model, dominance was not included in
the model of [41].
We measured participants’ memory through interviews.
After participants viewed each ad, an experimenter ﬁrst
asked participants to describe the brands and products.
Then, participants were required to recall the ad content or

plot, which were audiorecorded. After that, the experimenter
asked participants about the most impressive scenes or
words in the ad. At the end of the interview, participants
expressed their feelings about the ad freely.

3.4. Procedure. Participants in each group independently
viewed eight ads in a news feed on a smartphone. Each ad
could be regarded as a small section. In each section, the
video ads appeared in the middle of the feed, and participants were supposed to read the news they like and view the
ads. After they ﬁnished watching the ads, they could continue to read the rest of the news. The reason we chose news
as opposed to a social feed was to hinder the inﬂuence of
participants’ emotions.
The entire experiment proceeded as follows: (1) participants read and signed the informed consent form; then,
they completed the preexperimental questionnaire including
their personal information, ads preference, and their attitude
toward ads; (2) the experimenter introduced the experimental task to participants; (3) the experimenter helped
participants put on their EEG neuroheadset and eye tracking
devices; (4) in each section, participants read the feed and
watched the ads; then, they completed a questionnaire and
were interviewed; and (5) after participants ﬁnished the eight
sections, the experimenter helped participants take oﬀ the
measurement equipment.

4. Results and Analysis
4.1. Eye Tracking. We used three indicators to measure participants’ attention when they were watching the ads. The four
experimental groups signiﬁcantly diﬀered per the three indicators (Table 1) according to the analysis of variance (ANOVA).

For PDT, there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the four
groups (p � 0.02). Tukey’s post hoc test revealed that the M15
and U15 group’s mean scores were higher than the U30 group.
For AFT, there was also a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the four
groups (p < 0.01). Tukey’s post hoc test revealed that the U15
group’s mean score was signiﬁcantly higher than the other three
groups’ scores, and the U30 group’s score was higher than that
of the M6 group. Lastly, for FFT, there was a marginally signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the four groups (p � 0.09). Tukey’s
post hoc test revealed that the U15 group’s mean score was
signiﬁcantly higher than the U30 group’s score.
Regarding key elements, we compared the PDT, AFT, and
FFT between the three key elements (title, text, and logo) in the
M6 group and M15 group by two-way ANOVA. The results
revealed main eﬀect of key elements in terms of PDT (p < 0.01)
, AFT (p < 0.01), and FFT (p � 0.02). Post hoc analysis indicated that the text area enjoys more attention from the
participants since the PDT, AFT, and FFT are higher than the
other two areas. The results also showed the interaction eﬀect
between duration and key elements (p < 0.01) in PDT

Mobile Information Systems

4.2. EEG. We used EEG to measure participants’ valence and
arousal when they were watching the ads. We conducted an
ANOVA to compare the four diﬀerent ad groups (Table 2).
There was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence (p < 0.01) in valence. Tukey’s
post hoc test revealed that the M6 and U30 groups’ valence
scores were signiﬁcantly more positive compared to the other
two groups. There was also a signiﬁcant diﬀerence regarding
arousal (p < 0.01). Tukey’s post hoc test revealed a signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between the M6 group and the other three groups.
The mean values of the EEG for emotional valence and arousal
for the four ads groups are shown in Figure 5, which implies that
M6 was more favored by participants than the other three
groups since higher valence and arousal usually lead to better
advertising eﬀectiveness.

Dwell time percentage

(Figure 4). Post hoc analysis indicates that participants spent
much more dwell time on the text area when viewing long

the title area when viewing the short duration videos. No other
interaction eﬀects were found.

4.3. Self-Report Questionnaires. We measured participants’
attitudes, emotions, and intentions through a self-report
questionnaire with an ANOVA (Table 3). There was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in participants’ self-report valence
(p < 0.01), and Tukey’s post hoc test revealed that the valence of the M6 group was more positive as compared to the
U15 group (smaller values indicate more positive valence),
which was consistent with the EEG result. There was also a
signiﬁcant diﬀerence in participants’ attitudes toward the
brands, and Tukey’s post hoc test revealed that the U30
group’s score was signiﬁcantly higher than the M6 group’s
score.
We also investigated the correlation among participants’
background characteristics (age, sex, consumption level, and
phone usage time per day) and the questionnaire measures
above. The results indicated that participants’ intentions to
use, purchase, and recommend were signiﬁcantly related to
their valence and brand attitude; although, no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences were found concerning these measures in the
ANOVA described above (Figure 6).

4.4. Interviews. We interviewed participants after each
section to measure their memories of the ads and their
attitudes. We encouraged participants to recall as much ad
content as possible, and the level of detail they described
indicated their memory of the ads. We encoded the interview results through NVivo, qualitative data analysis software, and divided their descriptions into four categories:
wrong description, obscure description, brief description,
and detailed description. We divided their attitudes into
three categories per their responses.
The results of the Kruskal–Wallis test are shown in
Table 4. There was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the four
groups regarding detailed description (p < 0.01). Pairwise
comparisons revealed that the number of participants in the
U30 group who described the ads in detail was signiﬁcantly

signiﬁcant diﬀerence regarding wrong descriptions, pairwise
comparisons revealed that the descriptions of participants
from the U15 group were more likely to be wrong than the
M15 group. The result implies that the ads with key elements
enhanced the participants’ memory of the ads. There was
also a marginal diﬀerence between the four groups in
negative attitudes (p < 0.01). Pairwise comparisons revealed
that participants in the M6 group produced fewer negative
attitudes than the other three groups.

5. Discussion
5.1. Attention. Attention was measured through eye tracking in our research. We used three measures to describe
participants’ attention when they were watching ads. We
found that participants’ sight stayed in the ad area relatively
longer in the M15 and U15 groups than the U30 group
because the participants were likely to get distracted when
viewing mobile feeds when the ads exceeded a certain length.
No signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found between the U15 and
U6 groups, which implies that 15 seconds is an appropriate
length for mobile-feed ads before users become distracted.
The AFT for U15 and U30 groups was longer than the AFTof
the M15 and M6 groups, which is because the videos for the
latter had more elements per second than the videos in the
former. Further, participants’ sight jumped between the key
elements (logos and texts) and video contents. There were
fewer elements in the videos in unoptimized group videos;
therefore, participants’ sight was relatively more ﬁxed.
Moreover, the U30 group’s FFT was longer than that of the
other three groups, which implies that participants tend to
ﬁx their eyes longer in U30 videos. Therefore, when viewing
the mobile-optimized ad, participants received more information. Their attention was relatively scattered compared
to other conditions; on the other hand, participants’ sight
was comparatively more ﬁxed when viewing unoptimized
videos.
We then compared participants’ attention in the three
diﬀerent key elements—title, text, and logo area. There was
an interaction eﬀect between the groups and key elements.

Since we only compared the key elements in the M6 group
and M15 group, which diﬀered in duration, the interaction
eﬀect is, as a fact, between duration and key elements.
Therefore, we found that participants would pay more attention to the ad title area when the ad duration was short;
however, as the ad duration increased, participants shifted
their attention to the text areas. This implies that ad titles
play a key role when the ad duration is very short, and texts
are vital when the ad duration becomes longer. It would be
eﬃcient for advertisers to design a good title for short ads,
and it would be better to focus on the texts in longer ads.
5.2. Emotions. In this research, we evaluated participants’
emotions from two dimensions: valence and arousal. Three
methods were used to measure these two dimensions: EEGs,
questionnaires, and interviews, and the results of these three
methods were consistent. The EEG results indicated that the
M6 and U30 groups were more positive than the other two
groups; however, the M6 group had higher arousal than did
the U30 group. The questionnaire results revealed that the
M6 group was more positive than was the U15 group. The
interview results revealed that participants held less negative
attitudes in the M6 and M15 groups than the other two
groups, which also reﬂects a more positive valence in
emotion. Thus, the M6 group’s ads were the most preferred
by the participants, possibly because shorter ads least interrupt the users reading ﬂow and thereby induced less
intrusiveness. On the contrary, a long duration ad will interrupt the reading process, aﬀecting users’ experience of the
mobile feeds. Watching a long ad in mobile feeds can also
cause fatigue and boredom; therefore, it is better to use a
shorter duration video ad in mobile feeds to reduce negative
emotions. It is also worth noting that we compared relative
positive and negative emotions rather than absolute positive
and negative values. Therefore, the above comparison does
not explain whether emotions were positive or negative
when viewing a certain group of ads.
5.3. Memory and Attitude. Memory was mainly analyzed
through the results of the interviews. By encoding the interview results, we can obtain participants’ memories of the
ad content. We found that participants in the M6 group
recalled less of the advertising content, and participants in
the U30 group remembered more details about the ads than
the other groups. This result is similar to what we found
concerning attitude, which was measured with the questionnaires. The results indicated that participants’ attitudes
toward the brand were higher in the U30 group than in the
M6 group. Although no other signiﬁcant diﬀerences were
found, the correlation analysis revealed that participants’
intention to use, purchase, and recommend was signiﬁcantly
related to valence and brand attitude.
The reason why the U30 group displayed better memory
and a positive brand attitude than did the M6 group was that
the ads in the U30 group had enough time to advertise the
products to participants. Participants have more of a chance
to learn about the product and form opinions in longer ads
than shorter ads, which may foster positive brand attitudes.

Mobile Information Systems

Another interesting ﬁnding was that participants of the
U15 group made more mistakes when they were asked to
recall the content of the ads compared to the participant of
the M15 group, possibly because the key elements in M15
helped users to capture the key information about the ads.
The result implied that adding key elements in the mobilefeed video ads would facilitate a better understanding of the
ads.

titles were more eﬀective in delivering information to users
in the short video ads, whereas text played a more important
role in native video ads of long duration. In summary, the
present study ﬁlls a gap in the literature of native video ads in
mobile feeds by exploring the eﬀect of duration and key
element design. In addition, our research has proposed a set
of methods for studying advertising eﬀectiveness in mobile
feeds. The ﬁndings and methodology in our study will
beneﬁt practitioners in the advertising industry.

5.4. Limitations and Future Directions. Our study does face
several limitations. Firstly, the number of our participants
was relatively small. However, given that each participant
was asked to view eight video ads from eight diﬀerent advertisers separately, the total number of experiment trials is
quite considerable. This could partially compensate for the
deviation caused by an insuﬃcient number of people.
Secondly, the experiment was not orthogonally designed
since two certain groups, 6-second ads without key elements
group and 30-second ads with key element group, were not
examined in our research. Despite this, we still found interesting and meaningful results regarding duration and key
elements in mobile-feed video ads. The result can also help
ad companies understand some preferred features of video
ads in mobile feeds. Thirdly, we only considered one particular layout in the experiment. It was still unclear what
inﬂuence other layouts might have on the eﬀectiveness of
mobile-feed video ads. Finally, the cultural diﬀerence might
play a role in this research since all the participants were
from China. Future research could explore the inﬂuence of
cultural background on users’ responses to mobile-feed
video ads.

6. Conclusions
Our research investigated the eﬀects of duration and key
elements on the advertising eﬀectiveness of video ads in
mobile feeds through an empirical study. Speciﬁcally, we
compared the eﬀects of the ads of diﬀerent duration (6
seconds, 15 seconds, and 30 seconds) and the presence of key
elements on users’ emotions, attention, memory, and attitudes in mobile native video ads. We also distinguished the
role of diﬀerent key elements (titles, text, and logos) in the
ads of diﬀerent durations. We recruited 40 participants and
assigned them randomly into four groups to view four
diﬀerent types of ads in the news feed: 6-second ads with key
elements, 15-second ads with key elements, 15-second ads
without key elements, and 30-second ads without key elements. The results indicated that mobile video ads of short
duration led to signiﬁcantly higher valence and arousal,
fostering positive emotions among mobile users. However,
short duration ads made it diﬃcult for users to capture key
information about the ads, thus leading to poor understanding and memory of the ads. To compensate for the
disadvantage, it was suggested to implement certain key
elements, such as titles and text, to attract users’ attention
and help them get better comprehension in short video ads.
In other words, short duration video ads with key elements
were more preferred in mobile feeds. Per the key elements,

The raw/processed data required to reproduce these ﬁndings
cannot be shared at this time as the data also form part of an
ongoing study.
