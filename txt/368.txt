doi: 10.3389/fnins.2018.00517

Methods: N = 40 healthy subjects were included in the study. For proof of principle,
N = 6 ALS patients were additionally measured. For cognitive screening, we used the
Edinburgh cognitive and behavioral ALS screen (ECAS) in the standard paper-and-pencil
version. Additionally, we adapted the ECAS to a brain–machine interface (BMI) control
module to screen for cognition in severely advanced patients.
Results: There was a high congruency between BMI version and the paper-and-pencil
version of the ECAS. Sensitivity and specificity of the ECAS-BMI were mostly high
whereas stress and weariness for the patient were low.
Discussion/Conclusion: We hereby present evidence that adaptation of a
standardized neuropsychological test for BMI control is feasible. BMI driven
neuropsychological test provides congruent results compared to standardized tests with
a good specificity and sensitivity but low patient load.

INTRODUCTION
In many neurological conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), there is a combination
of decline in physical function and cognitive abilities. About 50% of ALS patients present with
cognitive deficits which are mostly mild and restricted to one cognitive domain; only 5–15%
present with full blown fronto-temporal dementia (FTD; Phukan et al., 2012; Goldstein and
Abrahams, 2013). In several studies on ALS, there has been evidence for specific impairments in
fluency, language, executive function including social cognition, and verbal memory (Beeldman
et al., 2016). It has been discussed controversially whether these impairments decline in the course
of physical function loss. Whereas some find no evidence (Kasper et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2017), others
report cognitive decline in the course of the disease (Elamin et al., 2013; Trojsi et al., 2016), but
possibly only in a subsets of patients, e.g., with bulbar onset (Schreiber et al., 2005). Discrepancies
between studies could either be explained by different subgroups or by a training effect in a

education according to previous studies (Keller et al., 2015).
To test for feasibility in physically impaired patients, N = 6
ALS patients were included (Table 1). None of the participants
had signs of any neurological or psychiatric illness (other than
ALS) or dementia. They were all native German speakers.
Patients were consecutively recruited from the clinics of the
Department of Neurology at the Universitätsklinikum Ulm,
Germany. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee
of the University of Ulm (No. 19/12). All participants gave
written informed consent to the study according to institutional
guidelines.

retest design. Most importantly, most studies so far did not
use motor adapted neuropsychological tests which can be
performed either written or verbally. The Edinburgh cognitive
and behavioural ALS screen (ECAS) as a standardized test with
parallel versions to be performed either written or verbally was
a first approach to bridge this knowledge gap (Abrahams et al.,
2014). Thus, for mildly advanced stages of physical impairments,
standard neuropsychological tests are at hand. For moderately
advanced stages of motor decline, eye-tracking controlled devices
can be used for neuropsychological screening (Keller et al.,
2015). However, for far advanced stages of physical disability
where speaking and hand motor abilities are severely impaired,
a state referred to as locked-in state, standardized approaches
to measure cognitive function are lacking. Instead, in this state,
there have been single case studies on cognitive profiles only,
using near infrared spectroscopy (Fuchino et al., 2008), eventrelated potentials (ERPs; Kotchoubey et al., 2003; Ogawa et al.,
2009) or visual recording of eye-blink responses (Lakerveld et al.,
2008). Cohort studies have not been performed so far and there
is lack of informative data on the cognitive abilities of the vast
majority of these patients. Instead, many locked-in (LIS) patients
including those with ALS are clinically regarded to have dementia
despite no valid data on cognitive profile. Single case studies
provide evidence for preserved cognitive function in LIS, e.g.,
Lakerveld et al. (2008) tested for memory and attentional abilities
in LIS by asking the patient to respond via eye blink which
was visually detected by the interviewer; they provided evidence
for superior cognitive abilities in LIS. However, only recently
have there been standardized approaches to screen for cognitive
abilities in far advanced stages of motor impairments. First
paradigms used state-of-the-art eye-tracking controlled setups
in lab environment (Cipresso et al., 2012; Keller et al., 2015)
and at bedside (Keller et al., 2017) to reliably detect cognitive
impairment. LIS state Brain–machine interfaces (BMIs) have
been widely used for patients with severe physical restriction
for environment control (Mugler et al., 2010; Münßinger et al.,
2010) and communication (Nijboer et al., 2008) and might
provide additional information on state of alertness in complete
LIS state (Chaudhary et al., 2016). BMIs might also be used to
screen for cognitive function which has been tested in ALS for
single cognitive domains already (Poletti et al., 2016). We hereby
present a unique approach for the use of BMIs to conduct a
standardized neuropsychological screening method on several
cognitive functions in patients with ALS. We hereby use a
commercially available EEG device which has been shown to be
sufficient for BMI communication (Duvinage et al., 2013) and
combine it with the widely used ECAS to enable clinicians and
researchers to screen for disease specific cognitive functions to
bridge the gap of knowledge with regard to cognitive profile in
complete immobility.

Study Design
First, participants were screened for affective (ALS depression
inventory 12 items, ADI-12; Kübler et al., 2005; Hammer et al.,
2008), physical (ALS functional rating scale revised version, ALSFRS-R; Cedarbaum et al., 1999), and cognitive function [German
version of the Edinburgh cognitive and behavioral ALS screen
(ECAS); Abrahams et al., 2014; Lulé et al., 2015; Loose et al., 2016]
by a board certified neuropsychologist. In randomized order, half
of the participants performed the ECAS in a standard paperand-pencil version first (ECAS parallel version C) and then the
adapted BMI ECAS version (ECAS original version A), whereas
the other half performed both versions in reverse order. The
procedure took about 2 h.

BMI Setup
For bedside BMI neuropsychological testing, the mobile BMI
device Neuroheadset Emotiv Epoc+ was used (AF3, F7, F3,
FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, AF4, reference, for
further information see www.emotiv.com). Electrode impedance
was decreased by using saline liquid until the level required by
the software was reached (in the 10–20 kOhm range) and was
checked along the experiment.
Participants were positioned in front of a 8 × 5 speller
matrix adapted according to Farwell and Donchin (1988)
which was presented on a laptop screen (letters A–Z, German
“Umlaute”, ß, digits 0–9). Rows and columns of symbols were
disguised for 62.5 ms by faces (a face of Albert Einstein)

with a 125 ms interstimulus interval (Kaufmann et al., 2013;
Figure 1). Participants were asked to fixate a target which was
then highlighted twice (rare event eliciting a P300) in a row of 11
non-target highlight events. Selected stimulus according to P300
was presented above the speller matrix.
Each session was composed of one calibration set and one
ECAS trial. Calibration of the Speller was performed by asking the
participant to spell the sentence “Ulm is nice” (“Ulm ist schön”)
with the BMI. During this run, participants received no feedback
(i.e., subjects did not see which character the system actually
selected), since data were only collected for system calibration.
The percentage of letters correctly selected by the system out of
the phrase, considered as the measure of BMI calibration (‘BMI
calibration accuracy’) was automatically calculated. Only when
BMI calibration accuracy’ was >85%, ECAS BMI was performed.
In this study, all participants were above this accuracy threshold.

Stress and Weariness Rating
Following the BMI ECAS version, participants were asked to rate
their emotional stress and weariness following the ECAS BMI use
on a 5 point Likert scale.

Paper-and-Pencil Version of the ECAS
The ECAS is a widely used and well-validated ALS specific
cognitive screening tool measuring five domains of ALS specific
(executive function, language, and verbal fluency) and nonALS specific cognitive functions (memory and visuospatial
perception; Abrahams et al., 2014; Lulé et al., 2015; Loose et al.,
20161 ). In total, the ECAS encompasses 15 subtasks which
are subsumed under the five domains. Maximum total ECAS
score is 136 with decreasing score indicating lower cognitive
performance.

BMI Version of the ECAS

BMI Data Analysis

For the BMI adaptation, specific subtasks of the original
ECAS were selected such as language (naming and language
comprehension), restricted phonematic fluency and executive
functions (sentence completion and social cognition) for the
ALS specific tasks. For the non-ALS specific tasks, memory
(immediate recall and delayed recognition, key words of the
ECAS instead of whole story) and visuospatial function (cube
counting) was selected. For the patient BMI-ECAS version, the
length of the test needed to be reduced by selecting the most
discriminative items in the text according to previous research
(Lulé et al., 2015). According to performance in healthy subjects,
tables for verbal fluency scores and cut-off scores for cognitive

EEG data were recorded with the freeware BCI2000 (Schalk et al.,
2004). Using an oddball paradigm, a P300 signal was measured.
BCI200 classifier was used to determine P300 signal as a positive
deflection in voltage (up to 5 µV) with a latency of 800 ms from
the stimulus onset. The sampling rate was 128 Hz. The EEG signal
was high-pass filtered at 1 Hz and analysed offline with a common
average reference (CAR) spatial filter.

Correctness of the ECAS BMI Selection
Participants were asked to verbally indicate to the investigator
when the selected item by the system was not the intended one.
The percentage of correctly selected items by the system was
recorded.

impairments were defined according to ECAS criteria (<2 SD
from mean for cognitive impairments; Abrahams et al., 2014;
Table 2).
Naming: scorpion and igloo had to be named (maximum 2
points; original ECAS 8 objects).
Language comprehension: 4 objects were presented numbered
1–4. Four sentences (original ECAS, 8 sentences) were
acoustically presented of which one sentence described a
property of one object each. Participants were asked to
select the correct object for each consecutively presented
sentence (maximum 4 points; original ECAS, 8 objects and 8
sentences).
Memory: 10 words (all words to be remembered from
the original ECAS) were acoustically presented. Following,
participants were asked to produce all words which they could
remember (immediate recall). For delayed recognition, ten words
were presented of which only 5 had actually been presented
before. Subjects had to indicate “y” for yes or “n” for no according
to whether this word had been presented before (maximum
10 points; original ECAS, a story is given but only the ten
words of the BMI test are valid for scoring in the original
ECAS).
Visuoconstruction: Two objects that were made of cubes were
presented separately. Subjects had to determine the number
of cubes of each object (maximum 2 points; original ECAS, 4
objects).
Sentence completion: three sentences with the last word
missing were to be completed by the subject by providing a
word which did not logically complete the sentence (maximum
3 points; original ECAS, 6 sentences).
Restricted phonematic fluency: subjects had to name 4
letter words with the given initial letter “G” within 8 min
(maximum 12 points; same for original ECAS within 90 s
time). Verbal fluency index was calculated according to
healthy subjects’ performance analogous to Abrahams et al.
(2014).
Social cognition: subjects first had to indicate personal
preference for one out of four numbered objects. Three sets
of four objects were presented (original ECAS six sets of four
objects). Subsequently, subjects had to indicate the preference of
a face that was presented adjacent to the same sets of four objects
(maximum 6 points).

Frontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

All answers were spelled via the spelling matrix of the P300
speller (Figure 1).
According to performance in healthy subjects, tables for verbal
fluency scores and cut-off scores for cognitive impairments were
defined according to ECAS criteria (<2 SD from mean for
cognitive impairments; Abrahams et al., 2014; Table 2).

Statistics
Data were managed in SPSS (SPSS version 21.0 IBM). Mann–
Whitney U-test was used for group comparison with effect size
r. For correlation analysis, Spearman–Rho test was used. All
analyses were two-sided and significance level was set at p = 0.05.

RESULTS
General Cognitive Screening
When compared to healthy controls, patients scored
significantly lower in the language function (U = 65.00,
z = −2.22, p = 0.027, r = −0.33). Scores of the other domains
(executive function, verbal fluency, memory, and visuospatial
function) did not significantly differ between the groups (all
p > 0.05).

Congruence of BMI and Paper–Pencil
ECAS
To determine whether performance accuracy of the BMI ECAS
could associate performance accuracy of the written paper–pencil
version, a Spearman–Rho correlation analysis was performed,
showing a significant correlation between the performance in
both versions of healthy controls (Spearman–Rho r = 0.64,
p < 0.001) and of both groups (Spearman–Rho r = 0.51,
p < 0.001). For patients, congruency was also acceptable but did
not reach significance due to the small sample size (Spearman–
Rho r = 0.40, p = 0.43).
For different cognitive functions, there was a significant
congruency for verbal fluency, sentence completion, social
cognition, immediate recall, social cognition, and cube counting,
for the other cognitive functions, congruency was low (Figure 2
and Table 3).

positive predictive value. The overall specificity of the BMI
version compared to the paper-and-pencil version was very high
at 95%.

Correctness of the ECAS BMI Selection
The median of correct answers of the control group for the P 300
speller was 85% for healthy subjects and 86% for ALS patients.

Subjective Rating of the Test
Patients (88%) and healthy subjects (86%) mostly reported that
they were not stressed by the ECAS BMI version and only a
minority reported to be slightly stressed by the procedure (12
and 14%, respectively); 48% of healthy subjects and 18% of ALS
patients regarded the BMI procedure to be wearisome.
FIGURE 2 | Congruency of ECAS paper and pencil version and BMI version in

DISCUSSION
So far, little is known about the cognitive state in complete
immobility in the course of physical decline in ALS (Fuchino
et al., 2008; Lakerveld et al., 2008). BMIs have been mainly used
to communicate with the patients to unlock the patients mind.
We hereby present a new BMI approach for neuropsychological
assessment in physically severely handicapped patients. Using
this approach, there is a standardized way to measure the
cognitive profile in these subjects.
We used a mobile P 300-based BMI algorithm to drive an ALS
specific neuropsychological test, the ECAS. Patients presented
a reduced performance in the language function in the paperand-pencil version compared to healthy controls. This is in
line with the previous findings that language function is the
most sensitive cognitive ability in the course of ALS (Keller
et al., 2015; Lulé et al., 2015; Niven et al., 2015; Wei et al.,
2015). For executive and visuospatial functions there was a trend
but other cognitive functions were not significantly different
between groups which was mainly attributed to small sample
size. There was a high congruency (Schmidt-Atzert and Amelang,
2012) between the adapted ECAS BMI and the original version.
Lack of congruency for some functions might be explained by
the adaptations in the BMI versions, mainly the reduction of

Validation of ECAS BMI Version in
Healthy Controls
Cognitive impairments for the total score and the five domains
were determined according to cut-off scores. Overall, one healthy
subject performed 2 SD below the overall ECAS score and for the
domain language, fluency, and executive function. Memory and
visuospatial performance was impaired in three and four subjects,
respectively.

Sensitivity and Specificity of the ECAS
BMI Version
There was a high convergent validity of the BMI version of
the ECAS, especially for fluency, sentence completion, social
condition, and cube counting. Predictive validity of the ECAS
BMI version was good. This was seen in a high sensitivity,
specificity, and positive predictive values, especially for social
cognition and verbal fluency (Table 2). The functions immediate
recall and cube counting in addition to the domain executive
function showed high specificity whereas sensitivity was in
a medium range. Only language showed low sensitivity and

cognitive decline in the course of physical function loss (Schreiber
et al., 2005; Elamin et al., 2013; Trojsi et al., 2016) or not (Kasper
et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2017). In which way cognitive function
develop, especially in the final state of physical function decline,
is so far mostly unknown. The main target of future trials will
be to see whether BMI controlled cognitive screening methods
are superior to previously introduced methods with eyetracking
control for those patients with residual eye movement (Keller
et al., 2016). For patients in complete locked-in state, BMI
driven approaches are a cost-effective and simple means of
neuropsychological examination of CLIS patients (Poletti et al.,
2016). The hereby presented BMI version of a standard
neuropsychological test is the next milestone to learn more about
cognitive decline in the course of ALS (Cipresso et al., 2012;
Poletti et al., 2016) but future studies are required to further
develop this approach.

items. The ECAS BMI version showed a high convergent and
predictive validity. This was indicated by a high sensitivity,
specificity, and positive predictive value, especially for social
condition and verbal fluency. Functions of the domains memory
and visual spatial abilities, and executive functions showed high
specificity whereas sensitivity was in a medium range. Only
language showed low sensitivity and low positive predictive
value which was partly explained by the fact of low numbers
of impaired controls in this domain. Interestingly, specificity
of single functions was similarly high as for the domain itself.
This implies that the measurement of one single function was
sufficient to get an overall estimation of the cognitive domain.
Future studies in larger samples are needed to verify this
hypothesis.
The correctness of the P300 speller was 85% in healthy subjects
and 86% in ALS patients, fulfilling the criterion of a minimum
of 70% accuracy as a predictor for satisfactory communication
(Choularton and Dale, 2004) and above the level of far advanced
ALS patients in other studies (Marchetti and Priftis, 2014).
Accordingly, patients were just as precise in spelling as the
healthy subjects (McCane et al., 2015), despite that a commercial
EEG device was used. For scientific P300 EEG analysis, there
are more open source products available which might better suit
these purposes than the hereby used Emotiv Epoc. However, for
satisfying communication with BMI, an accuracy rate of 70% is
required which was achieved by the hereby presented approach.
Due to a high intrinsic motivation to learn BMI control for
the future, the patients might have been especially concentrated
during the task. Overall, the ECAS BMI seems to be a feasible way
to easily and reliably detect cognitive deficits in ALS, especially
since most subjects rated the BMI version to be valid and neither
stressful nor explicitly strenuous.
The major limitation of the current study is the lack
of validation in a large patient sample with severe physical
impairments. We hereby present a first proof of principle
design with promising results but future studies in patients
with advanced physical impairments are warranted. Another
limitation is that most tasks of the original ECAS were simplified
and shortened and therefore not identical to the original version.
Due to high congruency of both of versions, it can be assumed
that both approaches measure similar cognitive constructs.
However, in future trials similar ECAS versions need to be used
for BMI and paper and pencil versions.
