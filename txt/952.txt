Abstract—This study used the traditional P300 speller
paradigm to compare a medical grade Electroencephalography
(EEG) system, the G.Tec, with a consumer grade EEG system,
the Emotiv, in the detection of P300 components within Event
Related Potential (ERP) signals. The experiment focused on four
electrodes known to produce optically induced visual evoked
potential. A successful comparison of the two approaches was
made. It was shown that both systems could measure an ERP.
The paper concludes with discussion comparing the low-cost
wireless EEG system with the medical grade EEG system.
Keywords—EEG, ERP, Evoked potential, P300, N200, Emotiv,

I. INTRODUCTION
Probably the most common neuroelectric technique to
measure human brain activities is Electroencephalography
(EEG), a noninvasive measurement, made with electrodes
placed on the scalp. EEG is most often used to diagnose
diseases of the brain such as seizure disorders, memory
problems and sleep disorders [1, 2]. The electrical activity on
the surface of the head measured by EEG can be analysed in
terms of frequency (e.g. Alpha, Beta brainwaves) and Event
Related Potential (ERP). ERP is used to investigate brain
activity synchronised to a time-locked stimulus or physical
activity in the human body [3-5]. This paper focuses on the
potential of making measurements of ERPs using a consumer
grade EEG. Current EEG research is focused on developing
brain computer interfaces (BCI) for both gaming and assisting
people with disability.The protocols used for this experiment
make use of the technique developed for EEG spellers.
In the past decade, EEG-based BCI have been the focus of
research in application areas used to spell words, control an
electronic device, or complete a task in a gaming application
[6].
Until recently, the majority of equipment used to measure
EEG, have been traditional medical grade devices [1, 2, 4].
These devices have their strengths and weaknesses. The most
significant advantage of this approach is the availability of high
precision time and potential measurements. Whether the
participant is awake or asleep, the brain is constantly
generating a variety of electrical signals to control the

functioning of the body. The changes in these electrical
activities are typically measured in millisecond timescales.
Therefore, high time resolution is necessary to determine the
precise moments at which these electrical events take place.
EEG has been shown to provide an effective way of measuring
visual ERP’s in experiments. In a working memory (WM) and
psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) reported in the literature, the
authors show that an effective reliability measure can be
achieved in both cases sessions (r > 0.9 in WM tasks and r >
0,8 in PVT task) [6]. In another study, the authors demonstrate
that similar reliability can be achieved in response to ERPS
generated by face and noise textures (r ~ 0.9) [7].
The disadvantages of traditional EEG devices are limited to
wired connections to each individual scalp electrodes attached
to the amplifier [1]; the devices can take a long time to adjust
the electrodes to get a good signal; It is also required to use
conductive gel on individual electrodes to ensure good
conduction to scalp. The wired connection and gel electrodes
create a restriction to movement, in order to achieve a clean
EEG signal. In addition, a complete EEG system can also be
quite costly. In recent years, a number of consumer grade EEG
devices have been developed and commercialised. These
devices specify themselves as BCI devices and wearable
meditation headsets [7-9]. The advantageous features of these
devices are low-cost, wireless and portable. Researchers were
gained interests in such devices as their potential to perform
comparable EEG measurement compared with the medical
grade EEG systems inside and outside the laboratory [10-12].
The most popular consumer grade EEG devices are the
NeuroSky MindWave™ [9], the NeuroFocus Mynd™, the
Muse™ [7] and the Emotiv EPOC™ [8]. These devices only
need minor adjustment for setup and typically use dry
electrodes or saline soaked cotton pads in direct contact with
the scalp. This quick setup coupled with wireless
communication makes them ideal for studies using a larger
number of participants as it reduces disruption to the wearer.
Although there has been an increase in the use of low-cost
EEG devices in research applications, the question of measured
EEG quality still remains. The Emotiv EPOC has been given
the most attention in the literature compared to other wireless
EEG systems [11, 15-20].

Campbell et al. [10] developed a NeuroPhone system on a
smartphone similar to a P300 speller experiment. The P300
wave is a positive deflection in ERP and it is most likely
elicited from oddball paradigm when subject detects an
occasional ‘Target’ stimulus [4, 13]. The NeuroPhone system
has a specially designed phone book that has six photos flashed
in sequence, the user looked at one photo and used an Emotiv
EPOC headset to record user’s brain activity, then analysed the
EEG data in real time to detect which photo the user wished to
dial. The paper reported a good accuracy of P300 signal
detection under sitting conditions (percentage of all events that
are correctly classified as P300 component, accuracy is
88.89%). The paper also suggests that P300 signals are
susceptible to external noise. It was necessary to average a
large number of trials to obtain a reliable P300 signal. Tong et
al. [11] came up with a similar P300 based dialing BCI system
on a tablet and used the Emotiv EPOC to detect P300 signals.
The system used 4x3 matrices of alphanumeric characters that
enabled users to spell a phone number. The system has been
tested in a relatively quiet lab/office environment and noisy
subway environment. The results showed similar findings that
using the system in a noisy environment produced a low
performance (accuracy in a laboratory is 88.75±10.57 and in a
subway environment 73.75±16.94). Debener et al. [12]
modified the Emotiv EPOC to reconnect all electrodes onto a
EEG cap with Ag/AgCl electrodes instead of saline soaked
cotton pad at location FPz, F3, Fz, F4, C3, Cz, C4, TP9, Tp10,
P3, Pz, P4, O1, and O2 according to 10-20 system. Their study
used an auditory oddball paradigm presented to participants
with standard (n=660) and deviant (n=84) stimulus in indoor
and outdoor conditions. Debener et al. found that the deviant
stimulus produced a higher amplitude P300 signal in both
indoor and outdoor conditions compared to standard stimulus.
In addition, indoor conditions produced significantly larger
P300 signals.
The research papers reviewed above demonstrated that the
Emotiv EPOC can detect P300 signals. However, comparison
of the performance of the Emotiv with other, research grade
systems has not been widely available. Duvinage et al.
compared the Emotiv EPOC and Advanced Neuro Technology
(ANT) acquisition system by using a modified P300 speller
task, which has only four alphabet letters to detect visual
evoked potentials [17]. Participants wore two devices
separately in different sessions. Both the Emotiv EPOC and
ANT acquisition system obtained reliable P300 signals.
However, the Emotiv system has weaker P300 signal detection
due to a poorer intrinsic signal to noise ratio (SNR). Badcock
et al. [14, 15] and Lissa et al. [16] conducted three studies that
compared the Emotiv EPOC and Neuroscan system. The
authors proposed a novel approach, which placed two devices
side by side according to the classic 10-20 system location in
order to let both systems record EEGs simultaneously. The
early study from Badcock et al. was presented with an auditory
oddball stimulus to adults with deviant tones (n=100) and
standard tones (n = 566) played randomly [16]. The authors
carried out a list of comparison results with the electrodes in
the frontal lobe (A3, A4, AF3, AF4). In this work, they
showed that the Emotiv produced a slightly less reliable signal
than the Neuroscan system. Both systems detected an ERP.
The later study of Badcock et al. [14] replicated the same

experiment with 18 children. The results produced were
remained very similar, both the Neuroscan system and the
Emotiv system detected standard and deviant waves with high
reliability. Stytsenko et al. provided a comparison between
Emotiv EPOC and G.Tec system also confirmed that both
systems are alike in general, but the signal is cleaner and
stronger in the G.Tec system [17].
The aim of this paper is to use the traditional P300 speller
experiment to evaluate the performance of Emotiv EPOC+
device compared to medical grade G.Tec g.USBamp system
[18]. Demonstration of the effectiveness of the wireless system
will allow its incorporation into a driving simulator to assess
the driver’s cognitive response to distraction events
synchronised with an eye-tracking system.
II. METHODOLOGY
A. Participants
All measurements were taken from three healthy
individuals (age range: 23 to 53 years) free of past or present
neurological or psychiatric conditions with normal or corrected
to normal vision. Small participant numbers in these types of
studies is not unusual [10, 19, 20]. As this is an initial
commissioning experiment to validate a wireless EEG device,
a small sample size is deemed sufficient to characterise the
signal response of the device itself.
B. Visual oddball task
The participants were required to attend the most widely
used visual oddball task, the “P300 speller”, designed by
Farwell and Donchin [21]. The speller is a 6x6 matrix,
consisting of 26 alphabet letters and 10 digital numbers (0-9)
as shown in Fig. 1. The participants’ task was to focus on ten
randomly selected symbols in the matrix one at a time. The
row and column of the matrix were randomly intensified for
200 milliseconds (ms), followed by 100 ms of nonintensification. Two out of twelve intensifications contained
the target symbol (16.7% target stimuli and 83.3% non-target
stimuli). Twelve repetitions for each symbol to increase the
low SNR due to other un-related brain signals, muscular and
ocular artefacts. The inter-repetition delay was set at 1 second.
The inter-trial delay was set at 3 seconds. During the inter-trial
delay, the task indicated the next highlighted symbol to be
focused by the participants.

A row or colume intensifies by a given rate. The target letter displays at the
bottom of the window. A P300 signal should be elicited when participant see
the desired letter is intetensified.

C. Equipment
As participants looked at the desired target symbol, EEG
was recorded from a medical grade G.Tec g.USBamp system
and a wireless Emotiv system separately. The g.USBamp
system uses a standard USB 2.0 interface, which makes the
amplifier easily connect to the USB socket on PC/notebook
and can immediately be used for data recording. The system
has 16 simultaneously sampled biosignal channels with 24 bits
resolution. Regarding the wide-range DC-coupled amplifier,
the sampling rate can adjust from 64 Hz to 38.400 Hz. In this
experiment, the electrode impedance was measured and
maintained under 20 kilohms for each channel using
conductive gel. Signals were checked using the G.Tec
developed Matlab Simulink impedance checker. Electrode
locations were chosen to match the same locations provided by
the Emotiv EPOC. In addition, the extra two electrodes were
situated at Pz and POz locations. The g.USBamp system
amplifier has an input range of ±250 mV, which allows
recording of DC signal without saturation, and has four
independent grounds to guarantee no interference between the
recorded signals.
The Emotiv EPOC+ headset (2016 later edition), which
was used in this experiment, comes with 14 channels and uses
CMS/DRL (common mode sense/driven right leg) references
at P3/P4 locations. The electrodes are held with a plastic arm
that holds a small cap with saline soaked felt pad inside. The
electrode locations are based on the international 10-20 system
as shown in Fig. 2. The device uses a Bluetooth transmitter and
has an inbuilt battery with a life of about 12 hours. The signal
is internally digitized at 2048 Hz (16-bit) and subsequently low
pass filtered (43 Hz) and downsampled to either 128Hz or 256
Hz.

at its default location as shown in Fig. 2 and recorded EEG at
128 Hz sampling rate.
E. Offline EEG processing
All EEG data recorded from G.Tec g.USBamp and Emotiv
systems were processed offline using EEGLAB (v 14.1.1) [23]
and ERPLAB (v 7.0) [24]. The first step was downsampling
the continuous G.Tec data from 512 to 128 Hz, in order to
match the sampling of Emotiv system. The data from the
G.Tec and Emotiv were bandpass filtered at 0.16 – 30 Hz to
remove DC and other high frequency noise. Data from both
systems then extracted epochs from -200 ms to 800 ms regards
to stimulus onset. Each epoch then was baseline corrected from
-200 ms to 0 ms preceding stimulus onset. An automatic epoch
rejection method was used to remove extreme value epochs.
Independent component analysis (ICA) was used on the
epoched data to remove eye blink artefact and facial muscle
movement artefacts. For each participant, epoched data
comprising target and non-target trials were averaged
separately to create ERP waveforms. Electrodes were chosen at
channel P7 P8 O1 and O2 to observe in the experiment, due to
the visual cortex is located in the occipital lobe of the brain
[11, 25]. P300 peak latency was assessed between 250 ms to
550 ms, N200 peak latency was assessed within 160 ms to 300
ms, using the approach described in the literature [29]. The
amplitudes of two components were measured.

influencing the experiment were kept same for two conditions.

electrodes locations in international 10-20 system (right).

D. EEG recoding
The experiment took place in a RF shielded room (>100dB
1GHz and 100GHz). Participants sat on a comfortable chair
with a 19-inch monitor placed at about one meter in front, as
shown in Fig. 3. When recording the EEG, the G.Tec system
amplifier and the Emotiv bluetooth dongle were connected to a
desktop computer running the OpenViBE open-source
software (version 2.0) the experimental runs for each device
implemented one after the other [25]. For the G.Tec system we
recorded the EEG at 512 Hz sampling rate and used the left ear
lobe as reference, ground electrode was positioned in the
forehead at AFz. For Emotiv EPOC+, the reference sensor was

III. RESULTS
A. Temporal patterns of ERP components in P300 Speller
All data epochs were averaged from all trials of each
individual electrode of each participant. The correspondent
target stimulus epochs and non-target stimulus epochs were
averaged respectively.
Fig. 4 presents the single trials ERP image of target stimuli
elicited by the P300 speller paradigm from participant 2 & 3,
electrode location O2 with the G.Tec system. Fig. 4a shows
that the P300 ERP signal is presented in most of the events that
include a target stimulus, as seen by the red band around 300
ms. This P300 component shows a constant visual stimulus
onset related activity throughout the duration of the
experiment. However, over the duration of the experiment, the

amplitude of the P300 ERP signal was reducing, as well as the
latency was varying. The variability of amplitudes and
latencies might be affected by the decline in concentration
level and the reduced attentional focus. On the left side of the
P300 component, a less visible N200 component was also
noted, as seen by the blue band at 200ms. The N200 typically
evoked 180 ms to 325 ms following the presenting of a specific
visual or auditory stimulus [26]. A number of studies have
validated that the N200 component can be elicited from an
oddball detection task [14, 15, 27, 28]. Analysis of evoked
potentials in response to visual stimuli reveals a stronger
negative component around 220 ms post-stimulus onset in Fig.
4b. This N200 component was attributed to more than twothirds of the events that include a target stimulus. In addition,
the P300 ERP signal in Fig. 4b is significantly weaker compare
to Fig. 4a. A visual N200 experiment demonstrated in [29],
discovered that the P300 elicitation can be inhibited by the
appearance of N200 in tasks of motor activity suppression.
Therefore, we discovered low visibility of P300 components in
Fig. 4b may heavily impact by the robust N200 components.
Apart from this, subject to subject variability could also
directly influence the results.

Fig. 4 Single trials ERP images of target stimuli. (a.) This data was recorded
with G.Tec system, channel O2 from participant 3. The P300 component can
be observed. (b.) This data was recorded with G.Tec system, channel O2 from
participant 2. The N200 component can be observed.

Fig. 5 displayed two comparison plots of the averaged ERP
waveforms between target stimuli and non-target stimuli
derived from the P300 speller paradigm from participant 2 & 3,

electrode location O2 with the G.Tec system. In Fig. 5a, we
can distinguish the different amplitudes between the target
stimuli waveform and the non-target stimuli waveform in the
area from 300ms to 400ms. The peak amplitude in the red trace
indicates that the target stimulus has visually registered in the
brain. The blue trace has a periodic pattern indicated by the
non-target stimulus, this has a similar but smaller response to
the target stimulus. It is referred to as the steady-state visual
evoked potential (SSVEP) [30]. This diminished signal is in
response to the stimulus caused by the change of scene. It has
been shown that the non-target stimulus is statistically smaller
than the response to the target stimulus. Error bars were plotted
at the peak amplitudes of both target and non-target stimuli
waveforms. The peak amplitude of target stimuli waveform has
standard error 4.46±0.46 uV, the corresponding peak amplitude
of the non-target stimuli waveform has a standard error
2.01±0.20 uV. The two error bars did not overlap each other,
which denoted that the P300 ERP signal was significant. In
Fig. 5b, a large sharp negative peak can be observed in the
target stimuli waveform. The waveform contained the N200
component at the peak latency at 220 ms. This signal was well
separated from the non-target waveform. To quantitatively
evaluate the significance of the N200 component, we
calculated the standard error at the negative peak amplitude 7.59±0.74 uV (target) vs. -1.16±0.28 uV (non-target).

system from electrodes location O2 on participant 3. (b.) ERP target
waveform and non-target waveform was recorded with G.Tec system from
electrodes location O2 on participant 2. Standard errors were calculated for
both target stimuli waveform and non-target stimuli waveform in both (a.) and
(b.).

B. G.Tec and Emotiv features comparison from most active
channels
One of the aims of this paper was to discover the most
effective channels to record a P300 ERP signal using the
Emotiv system. The electrodes chosen were located at P7 O1
O2 and P8. These were chosen as the Emotiv EPOC+ headset
has only these four electrodes located across the occipital
region. The G.Tec system can easily change the electrodes
locations associated with the Emotiv system. Table 2 indicates
when the error bars do not overlap at the peak point of the
P300 and the N200 component. This was done for both the
G.Tec system and Emotiv system. The ‘tick’ represents the
error bars at the peak amplitude between target stimuli
waveform and non-target stimuli waveform did not overlap.
The ‘cross’ describes the error bar overlapped and indicates a
negative attempt to detect an ERP.
Looking down Table 1, the G.Tec system performed
perfectly on participant 1 and 3, but not on participant 2. This
could be in part due to participant 2 having a large N200
elicitation, refer to Fig. 5b; in addition, it is likely to be subject
to subject variability. Looking across Table 1, the electrode
location O2, achieved the best result among all electrodes. The
result matches what might be expected, that ERPs are likely to
be produced in the O1 and O2 area due to the Emotiv system
lack of electrodes in the central-parietal area. Similar findings
can be explored in Table 2. The G.Tec system performed
excellently over all participants in detecting N200 component.
For the Emotiv system, the O2 electrode has the best result.

Strong averaged ERP signals identified for the location O2
from the G.Tec system and the Emotiv system are over-plotted
for comparison as shown in Fig. 6. The two graphs have
similar ERP signal shape between the measurements of the
two systems. In terms of the components peak amplitudes, the
G.Tec measurement has stronger P300 detection and weaker
N200 detection than the Emotiv measurement. In respect of
the component peak latency, the P300 peak latencies are alike
from the measurement of both systems, the difference within
10ms. The N200 peak latencies, which the G.tec measurement
is leading 39 ms to the Emotiv measurement.

To quantify the similarity between the two waveforms, we
carried out cross correlation statistics studies. The correlation
coefficient ranges between -1 to 1. Values closer to 1 indicate
an increasing similarity. We specifically selected a range from
0 ms to 550 ms for each compared ERP waveforms to
compute the correlation coefficients and the phase shift (lags).
This range included the N200 and P300 features, which we
were interested. The outcome showed that correlation
coefficient r = 0.5 and lag = 125 ms, indicated a good
correlation between the two signals. We also calculated the
averaged phase shift across the four electrodes for participant
2 (103.51±7.48 ms) and participant 3 (105.47±27.43 ms).

IV. DISCUSSION
The aim of this paper was to test the validity of the P300
signal measured with the Emotiv EPOC+ system, by
comparing the P300 waveforms recorded with a medical grade
EEG system, the G.Tec. The results revealed that both N200
and P300 ERP waveforms produced by the EPOC+ system
were similar when compared with the waveforms produced by
the G.Tec system. Although there are research studies that
report that the Emotiv system produces lower quality signals
compared to medical grade systems [10, 11, 31-33], this device
is still capable of measuring ERP components for non-critical
applications, such as visual response or gaming. Our results
demonstrate that the Emotiv EPOC+ can produce useful ERP
waveforms.
The contribution of this study is that the low cost, wireless
EEG device has produced measurable ERPs. A limitation of
this work has been the small number of participant data,
consequently, grand averaged analysis could not be used.
However, similar studies of less than five subjects have been
published in the past [10, 19, 20]. A more quantitative
comparison between the research grade system and the low
cost system requires a larger study. A larger study would also
be required to understand the variability between subjects.
Other factors such as target stimulus sequence, probability,
and interstimulus interval may influence the ERPs [34, 35].
The design of the headset with the limited number of
electrodes covering the central-parietal area would be another
factor limiting the performance of the Emotiv. However, if the
electrodes could be relocated by modifying the Emotiv to

measure the parietal lobe, a better performance may be
achieved in future [36].

[17]

CONCLUSION
This study demonstrates that a low-cost wireless EEG
system can obtain useful ERP signals when compared with a
medical grade EEG system. The N200 and P300 components
detection between the medical grade system and the low-cost
wireless system are similar. The simplicity of use and
increased maneuverability of the wireless system available
makes this form of EEG suitable for future work on assessing
driver behavior relating to distraction events in a driving
simulator with a larger cohort size.
