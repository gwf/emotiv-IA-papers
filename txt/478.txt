I. Introduction
BCI controlled machine for rehabilitation is the form of the physio
rehabilitation and neuro rehabilitation. There are 15 million people suffer from the
affection of stroke annually worldwide (Ang, K, 2013). Referred to statistical report
from World Heart Federation, 6 million of the stroke patient died and 5 million of
them suffer from disability (World Heart Federation, 2017). Therefore it is essential
to provide rehabilitation as early as possible for the stroke survivors in order to
recover and get back to their daily function. There are research shows promising
results in recovering basic motor function for the BCI machine hand orthosis
rehabilitation showing 50% of the patients obtain improvement and changes in
clinical testing (Shindo, K. et al, 2011).
Spectrum information, spatial information and temporal information are com-piled
and mixed in the EEG raw data signal which is extractable. Temporal information
focus on the signal changes over-time due to event and thoughts changes. Spectrum

and spatial information
nformation are based on the frequency changes of the signal over
over-time
(Lotte, F., 2014) With classification output obtained from the BCI system the field
de-vice
vice able to reacts based on the classification output from the subject thoughts.
Therefore, in the part of the paper the research will be focused on the reality
control on the rehabilitation hand and virtual control for the game session for the
training before approaching to the rehabilitation hand control.

Brain wave recording

In brain wave recording, the subject is required to sit on a comfortable chair
with hand rest provided for comfort and reduce injury during the operation. Total of
10 sessions is included in this secti
section, each session consists of 5 trails. Subject will be
instructed which finger to move or rest the finger physically and imaginary based on
the video display in front of the subject. The video consists of ‘Move’ and ‘Rest'
instruction visually and audibly 5 secon
seconds
ds each and repeated for 6 times. Subject is
required to wear the EEG on the head; the electrodes will be placed correctly.
The data recorded for training purpose is pre
pre-processed
processed using Emotiv
Simulink exporter and the raw signa
signal is filtered using Bandpass
andpass filter of Frequency
band pass 4 – 30 Hz, Stopband attenuation is 60dB and Passband attenuation is 1dB.
Hence the output of this stage is pre
pre-filtered raw data of the EEG signal.
B.

EEG Signal processing

In this stage, the system focused on signal analysis and processing for signal
identification. Two important steps are applied in this stage which is Features
Extraction such as ERP, FFT, Channel Band Power and difference between
electrodes. As shown in table 1.

determined. The actual EEG raw data can be long and messy and required higher
order of matrix to perform intensive calculation.
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) able to determine the mental state of the signal
recorded from EEG. The obtain signal from brain wave recorded is pre-processed to 4
– 30 Hz which are Alpha, Beta and Theta band is co-existed in the raw signal. Using
FFT the raw data obtain can be filtered to 3 different frequency band in time domain
manners to analyze the feature of ERP which reduce the mixture of the signal for
simplified analysis.
CBP analyze the obtained raw signal in positive region by squaring all the data. The
strength of the signal can obtain using CBP features to understand the strength of the
electrodes obtain at different segment.
C.

Classification Prediction

Classification used to identify the obtain features vector into classes that is usable for
field-end devices. The output of the classification results will be +1 or -1 for deciding
the class of the features obtain. Features calculated and acquired is required to be
tabulated into series of the table form with class estimated. Matlab classification
Learner tools is used for modal training for high level identification and
classification. The output of the data depends on the features tabulated in the table for
classification learner.
D.

Actuators Control

In this stage, the output of the classification is the decisive action input for the
actuators control. There are 2 actuators is required to control in order to finish the
BCI training, which are (1) Virtual Actuators and (2) Real-Life Actuators.
Virtual Actuators

Fig. 2. Redesigned Simon Said
In virtual control, the subject required to play redesigned ‘Simon Said’ that have 5
buttons that represent each fingers movement to ‘Move’ (Press) and ‘Rest’ (Release)
as shown in figure 2. In this session of the training, the subject requires to achieve the
gaming scoring up to 90% before proceeding to Real-Life actuators control.

Flexion and Natural Relax design

Fig. 5. Rehab Hand Glove design
Figure 5 shows the design of the rehab hand glove that perform flexion and relaxation
of the finger for the rehabilitation. Using basic mechanisms of leveling and
positioning barring, the flexion and relaxation of the finger can be achieved. Nylon
string secured on the palm of the glove will be connected to servo horn that would
perform actuation while the servo motors actuates. When the nylon string tension,
finger flexes and elastic band tensed, where when the servo motors releases the nylon
string tension, finger relaxes and elastic band naturally recurred back to its natural
state.
Rehabilitation Hand uses leather glove and PVC fixed joint to perform the flex and
relax of the finger movement using servo motor pull. The subject requires to wear it
in full to the tip of the glove to provide optimal rehabilitation of the fingers. The
straps underneath the 3D printed components box is required to strap the box on the
subject have firmly and gently. Ensure the stroke hand is sit firmly on the PVC stand
to ensure low vibration during rehabilitation.
Figure 6 shows the working principle of the overall system in a visual
manner. First, the subject requires to wear the Emotiv EEG headset on the head and
make sure the connection of the electrodes is well connected. The subject will then
perform imagination or motor execution on the finger they wanted to move. All the
raw signal data will be collected using Emotiv EEG headset electrodes in terms of
micro-voltages. The Emotiv EEG headset is built-in with Bluetooth and come with
Bluetooth dongle, hence all the data obtain each 1/128 second will be transmitted
wirelessly towards computer for further processing.

Fig. 6. System working
Second, the obtained data from Emotiv EEG headset will be performing processing
such as feature extraction and classification. Feature extraction such as Difference of
ERP, ERP, FFT Filter set, Energy and ZCR is extracted. Classification Learner using
supervised machine learning to train the modal for output class predict based on the
features extracted from the EEG headset. The focus approaches are using LDA and
ESD for classification, due to testing and analysis that will be discussed in chapter 5.2
Quadratic Discrimination Analysis (QDA) and SVM is eliminated because of low
accuracy of performance. The output of the classification results is decisive and
numeric for field end device controlling.
Lastly, the obtain action control word from classification results will be sent
as the command to control the rehabilitation to execute which finger under which
event. Same apply to the Simon Said virtual training on the computer.

Table 5.1 shows the description of the subjects participated in the training
and testing for the project. As notice in the table, most of the subjects are first time
using EEG devices. Hence, the brain wave control for focus and concentration might
varies. 3 out of 10 of the subjects is workers, 4 out of 10 of the subjects is final year
students, different stress level could be appeared during the data recording session
which could lead to low accuracy output. Table 3 shows the list of the testing that will
be performed for the project and the numbers of the subjects involved in the testing.

Trained subject requires to perform virtual control before proceeding to the
reality control. Figure 9 shows the variation of different subject on virtual control
score point achievement. Subject 1 has the higher score point by following the
random finger queue done by Simon Said gaming since subject 1 is the one has the
longest training period among of the subjects. Subject 6 and 7 have intermediate
score point, because they have long hair that might affects the recording results.
Subject 4 has issues in cconcentrating the event cue therefore the score

IV. Conclusion
In conclusion, this paper discussed the real-time control on the BCI system that
perform actuations on the rehab hand for rehabilitation is achieved with system and
circuit design. The accuracy of the event controlling is around 45% to 60%. With
sufficient continuous training and controlling, human’s brains able to modulate the
brain signal to suit the pre-recorded signal trained classifier in the system to control
the actuator unit. The limitation of the device is slight delay of the processing on the
brain signal and actuators control of 1 second. The features require up to 1 second of
data to perform prediction and electroencephalogram used has limitation and
restriction on direct raw data acquisition to the system to perform fast real-time
control. Therefore, in recommendation the electroencephalogram used could be open
source to reduce the difficulties of the system to acquire raw data and determine
alternative features group for the system to reduce process time.
