ABSTRACT
New tools from neuroscience allow design researchers to explore design neurocognition. By taking the
advantage of EEG's temporal resolution we give up spatial resolution to focus on the performance of
time-related design tasks. This paper presents results from an experiment using EEG to measure brain
activation to study mechanical engineers and architects to compare their design neurocognition. In this
study, we adopted and extended the tasks described in a previous fMRI study of design neurocognition
reported in the literature. The block experiment consists of a sequence of 3 tasks: problem solving, basic
design and open design using a physical interface. The block is preceded by a familiarizing pre-task
using the physical interface and then extended to a fourth task using free-hand sketching. Brainwaves
were collected from both mechanical engineers and architects. Results comparing 36 mechanical
engineers and architects while designing were produced. These results indicate design cognition
differences between the two domains in task-related power between the problem-solving task and the
design tasks, in temporal resolution and transformed power.

INTRODUCTION

One of the questions that design research has studied is whether designing is domain specific or has
general characteristics that are independent of any domain of application (Goel and Pirolli, 1992).
There is some consensus on the notion that although the foundations of design are generic, the practice
of design differs in different domains through an increase or decrease in the various activities that
make up the foundations of designing (Gero and Kannengiesser, 2014; Visser, 2009). How different
domains practice design is of particular interest as design thinking has become an approach that claims
to transcend domains. In design education this is of interest as it affects whether it is possible to teach
design as a generic activity that is then supplemented by domain specific practice.
For the last 25 years design cognition has increasingly been studied using the protocol analysis method
(Cross, Christiaans, and Dorst, 1996; Ericsson and Simon, 1993; Kan and Gero, 2017; Van-Someren,
Barnard, and Sandberg, 1994). Protocol analysis-based studies have yielded a range of rich insights
into design as a process. These insights include the design cognition of domains (Akin, 2001; Cross
and Roozenburg, 1992; Schön, 1988).
Recently new non-invasive tools have provided access to brain behaviour through objective
measurements of various aspects of brain neurophysiology producing the field of neurocognition (Ward,
2015). This has opened the way for the first steps in understanding design neurocognition – the
neurocognition of designing. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based design
neurocognition studies are at the exploratory stage with one well-controlled experiment published
(Alexiou et al., 2009) and others that focus on design related behaviours rather than the acts of designing
(Goucher-Lambert, Moss and Cagan, 2017). fMRI has very high spatial resolution which helps in
narrowing down to very specific brain regions that are activated during any task, but it has low temporal
resolution. Designing is a temporal activity. By taking the advantage of the electroencephalography
(EEG) method’s high temporal resolution, we can focus on the investigation of time-related design tasks.
Design neurocognition EEG-based studies are emerging at an exploratory stage with a few reported
domain-specific studies on engineering design, architecture and industrial design. Results from
controlled experiments identify the relationship between design problem statements and cognitive
behaviors during conceptual design (Liu et al., 2018), visual attention and association in expert designers
(Liang et al., 2018), neurophysiological EEG signals to study effort, fatigue and concentration in
conceptual design (Nguyen et al., 2016), EEG bands associated with the design activities of problem
solving and evaluation (Liu et al., 2016), neurophysiological correlates of embodiment and motivational
factors during the perception of virtual architecture (Vecchiato et al., 2015). However, time-related
neural responses during problem-solving compared to design tasks across domains are as yet unknown.
EEG’s high temporal resolution during cognition can help elucidate the stages of the recognition of tasks
while provide the temporal basis for information processing (Hinterberger et al., 2014). Averaging the
measurements yields a measure of the EEG voltages that are consistently related to the sensory,
perceptual and decision-making processes (Dickter and Kieffaber, 2014). Results from neurosciencebased design studies show consistent higher activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of design
tasks and ill-structured problems (Alexiou et al., 2009), and insight (Kounios and Beeman 2014, Beeman
et al., 2004), recruiting a more extensive network of brain areas than problem solving (Alexiou et al.,
2009, Kounios and Beeman 2014). Neuroimaging studies are more advanced in creative cognition
(Martindale, 1999; Vartanian and Goel, 2005), and visual creativity and the arts (Pidgeon et al., 2016),
although no consensus has been found due to the different nature of the tasks across studies.
This study reported in this paper is part of an ongoing research to elucidate design neurocognition,
using it to distinguish design from problem-solving and to determine differences in brain behaviour
when design is carried out in different domains. The research is based on the analysis of participants’
brain waves using an EEG headset in the context of performing problem solving and design tasks in an
experimental environment. The objectives of the study reported here are to:
investigate the use of the EEG technique to distinguish design from problem-solving.
identify neurocognitive similarities and differences across design domains.
We postulate the following three hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1. Design neurocognition of mechanical engineers and architects are different.
Hypothesis 2. Neurocognitive temporal distributions of activations between mechanical engineers and
architects are significantly different.

Hypothesis 3. Neurocognitive temporal distributions of activations of mechanical engineers and
architects are non-uniform.

METHODS

We have adopted and replicated the tasks described in Alexiou et al. ( 2009), expanding their results
into the temporal domain using EEG’s high temporal resolution. We extend the experiment to a further
task. The set of tasks is preceded by a pre-task so that the participants can familiarize themselves with
the physical interface. The original tasks are followed by a third layout task and a fourth task based on
free-hand sketching. The replication of the experiment tasks of Alexiou et al. ( 2009) with EEG brain
wave data is supported with the analysis of data from video and audio recording and observation for
later protocol analysis.
2.1 Experiment setup
A physical interface for individual task performance was built based on magnetic material for easy
handling. A pre-task was designed so that participants can familiarize themselves with the use of the
headset, maneuvering the magnetic pieces and prevent them from getting fixated in Task. 1. This pretask also has the goal to familiarize participants with postural and facial movements and allows the
researcher to correct and fine tune so that the recording have low interference. The Mikado game was
given to the participants to play in the breaks between tasks as they have to accurately pick each piece
of the game this action helps them with the physical interface of the magnetic and movable pieces
during the tasks. The block experiment consists of a sequence of 3 tasks: problem-solving, basic
design and open design, Table 1 and Figure 1. We have matched Tasks 1 and 2 with the problemsolving and design tasks from Alexiou et al. ( 2009) as closely as possible in terms of number of
constraints, stimuli, number of instructions so that the cognitive effort to understand them is similar.
Task 3 provides an enlargement of the problem and the solution space and the opportunity of
evaluating and reformulating the design solutions. In Task 4, free-hand sketching, the participants are
asked to propose and represent an outline design. Each participant is given two sheets of paper (A3
size) and three instruments, a pencil, graphite and a pen. The participant is asked to: propose and
represent an outline design for a future personal entertainment system. Here, the purpose is to observe
differences in participants’ brain activation due to the nature of the tasks.
Table 1. Description of the problem-solving, basic design and open design tasks.

Task 1 Problem-solving
In Task 1 the design of a set
of furniture is available and
three conditions are given as
requirements. The task
consists of placing the
magnetic pieces inside a given
area of a room with a door, a
window and a balcony.

Task 2 Basic design
In Task 2 the same design set
of furniture is available, and
three requests are made. The
basic design task consists of
placing the furniture inside a
given room area according to
each participant notions of
functional and comfortable
using at least three pieces.

Task 3 Open design
In Task 3 the same design
available is complemented with
a second board of movable
pieces that comprise all the
fixed elements of the previous
tasks, namely, the walls, the
door, the window and the
balcony. The participant is told
to arrange a space.

1855

For Tasks 1 and 2 (Alexiou et al., 2009), the movable pieces were placed at the top of a vertical magnetic
board to prevent signal noise due to eye and head movements as tested in the physical magnetic board.
The EEG activity is recorded using a portable 14-channel system Emotiv Epoc+. Electrodes are arranged
according to the 10-10 I.S, Figure 2. The subjects performed the tasks on a physical magnetic board,
with two video cameras for capturing the participant face and activity and an audio recorder.

Figure 2. Emotiv Epoc+ electrodes arrangement (10-10 I.S.) and experiment setup using the headset.

All the data captures were streamed using Panopto software (https://www.panopto.com/) that also
allows for direct screen capture, Figure 3. One researcher is present in each experiment episode for
recordings and instructing the participant. A period of 10 minutes for setting up and a few minutes for
a short introduction are necessary for informing each participant, reading and signing of the consent
agreement and discussing the experiment. The researcher positions the participant at the desk and
checks metallic accessories for electromagnetic interference, as well as setting the room temperature.
The researcher asks each participant’s attention for neck movements, blinking, muscle contractions as
well, rotating the head, horizontal eye movements, pressing the lips and teeth, and silly faces in
particular during the tasks, as these affect the signal capture. Electromagnetic interference of the room
was checked for frequencies below 60Hz. The researcher follows a script to conduct the experiment so
that each participant gets the same information and stimuli. Before each task, participants were asked
to start by reading the text which took an average of 10s of reading period. Then the subjects
performed the sequence of five tasks previously described with breaks in between where they play
Mikado. The experiments took a total time between 34 to 66 minutes. The experiments took place
between March and July of 2017, and June and September of 2018 in a room with the necessary
conditions for the experiment, such as natural lighting from above sufficient for performing
experiments between 9:00 and 15:00 and no electromagnetic interference. An open question interview
took place in two distinct moments, at the end of Task 3 and 4.

Figure 3. Screen capture depicting audio, video and screen captures streaming in Panopto.

Each participant was reminded to use the bathroom and spit out any gum before the start of the
experiment. The researcher sits each participant at the desk, asks him/her to untie hair and remove
earrings and other metallic accessories of electromagnetic interference, check if they are using contact
lenses as these may cause to much blinking and interfere with data collection. Time was given to the

1856

ICED19

participants, in particular in Tasks 3 and 4 so they could find a satisfactory solution. In the short
interviews conducted at the end of Tasks 3 and 4 the researcher asks participants four open questions.
The oral responses to the open questions were recorded and transcribed for analysis. A 5 Factor
Personality Test given to each participant after the experiment. The 100 item questionnaire was
available online which participants accessed through a link sent by email or responded in place.
Results of the interviews and the personality tests will be reported elsewhere.
2.2 Participants
We invited mechanical engineers and architects demographically having the same characteristics
(language, culture, background) to the experiment for exploratory comparison. Information on
subjects’ demographics was gathered beforehand. In this study we describe the analysis of 36
individuals. Results depicted are based on 18 architects aged 28-51(M = 38.9, SD = 5.3), and 18
mechanical engineers, aged 25-40 (M = 28.4, SD = 3.7). The sample included 17 women (M = 32.5,
SD = 5.0) and 19 men (M = 34.7, SD = 8.3) all right-handed. This study was approved by the local
ethics committee of the University of Porto.
2.3 EEG data processing
In this research we adopt the techniques developed for the removal of muscle artifacts from EEG
recordings. The blind source separation (BSS) technique based on canonical correlation analysis was
proposed to separate tonic muscle artifacts from continuous EEG recordings during epileptic events
(De Clercq et al., 2006; Vergult et al., 2007). The same algorithm was adapted to remove the short
EMG bursts due to articulation of spoken language, attenuating the muscle contamination on the EEG
recordings and providing several research communities a tool to investigate the brain processes during
language production (Vos et al., 2010). Thus, for the present study the results are based on data
subjected to the blind source separation (BSS) technique for signal processing.
The EEG signals were recorded with electrodes placed according to 10-10 I.S, 256 Hz sampling rate,
low cutoff 0.1 Hz, high cutoff 50Hz. Data processing includes the removal of DC offset with the IIR
procedure, and the previously mentioned blind source separation technique (BSS). Data analysis then
proceeds with total and band power values, in the time-course of unfolding cognitive events, on
individual and aggregate levels, in MatLab and open source software, based on transformed power
(Pow) and task related power (TRP) calculations.
2.4 EEG data analysis
A total of 52 experiments were conducted, 26 per domain. Due to EEG recording issues four
experiments were initially excluded. The analysis then proceeded based on the EEG data recorded and
processed for each of the 48 remaining experiments, and each of the 14 electrodes used for averaging,
for each of the tasks. For the analysis of the transformed power (Pow) across tasks per participant a ztransform was conducted to determine outliers. The criteria for excluding participants were based on
the evidence of 6 our more threshold z-score values above 1.96 or below -1.96 and individual
measurements above 2.81 or under -2.81. This resulted in a further 12 experiments being excluded
leaving 36, circumstantially 18 for each domain.
We focus on the overall activation per channel, per task, per participant and domain as the study aim is
to know how far results for problem solving and designing discriminate across the tasks. The taskrelated power (TRP) is typically calculated taking the resting state as the reference period per
individual. We analyzed the EEG recordings of the resting periods prior to the experiment of a few
participants and their results vary considerably, some participants show signals that can be associated
with the state of being nervous (Liu et al., 2016) and expectant and their cognitive effort and activity is
unknown. As the focus of the present study is to know how far designing can be distinguished from
problem-solving we take the problem-solving Task 1 as the reference period for the TRP calculations.
Thus, for each of the 14 electrodes, the following formula was applied taking the mean of the
corresponding electrode i, in Task 1 as the reference period. By subtracting the log-transformed power
of the reference period (Powi, reference) from the activation period (Powi, activation) for each trial j
(each one of the five tasks per participant), separately, according to the formula:
TRPi = log (Powi, activation) j -log (Powi, reference) j

ICED19

(1)

1857

By doing this, the negative values indicate a decrease of task-related power from the reference
(problem-solving Task 1) for the activation period, while positive values express a power increase
(Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, 1999). TRP scores were quantified for total power and temporal
analysis was initially carried out by dividing each experiment session into halves per task across
domains. By power and activation, we refer to brain wave amplitude.

To compare the TRP of mechanical engineers and architects, we performed an analysis by running a
2x4x2x7 mixed repeated-measurement ANOVA, with the between-subjects factor domain and the
within-subject factors task, hemisphere and electrode. From the analysis of the 36 participants (18
mechanical engineers and 18 architects) we found a significant main effect of task, F(2.17,
73.67)=3.94, p<0.02, 2partial =.10 (corrected for Greenhouse-Geisser estimates of sphericity, =
.72). None of the other factors showed a significant main effect. Further, the ANOVA revealed a
marginally significant interaction effect between the factors task and domain, F(3, 34)=2.27, p<0.09,
2partial =.06; as well as a marginally significant interaction effect between the factors hemisphere
and domain, F(1, 34)=2.16, p=0.15, 2partial =.06. No other two-way interactions were found to be
significant or close to significant at this level of analysis.

1858

In addition, we conducted pairwise comparisons to check for differences between mechanical
engineers and architects comparing the 7 electrodes per hemisphere and task. Below we report both on
significant (p≤0.05) and close to significant (p≤0.15) pairwise comparisons. The following
comparisons were marginally significant or significant. For Task 2, electrodes F3(p=0.13), FC5
(p=0.14) and O1 (p=0.15) in the left hemisphere all electrode positions were marginally significant.
For Task 3, electrodes F4(p=0.02), T8(p=0.03) and O2 (p=0.03) significant and AF4(p=0.15) and
P8(p=0.06) marginally significant in the right hemisphere, and in the left hemisphere FC5 (p<.01)
significant and AF3(p=0.06), F3(p=.06), F7(p=0.12), P7(p=0.10) and O1(p=0.07) marginally
significant. For Task 4, electrodes FC6(p =0.11) in the right hemisphere and electrodes T7(p=0.14), in
the left hemisphere, marginally significant. Some deactivations per group will be analyzed and
interpreted in further studies. The indicators of significant and close to significant differences of some
electrodes/regions and hemisphere across tasks are shown in Figures 6.

To compare the TRP scores for the halves of mechanical engineers and architects, we performed an
analysis by running a 2x4x2x7x2 mixed repeated-measurement ANOVA, with the between-subjects
factor domain and the within-subject factors task, hemisphere, electrodes and half. From the analysis
of the 36 participants (18 mechanical engineers and 18 architects) we found a significant main effect
of task, F(2.15, 73.19)=4.77, p=0.01, 2partial =.12 (corrected for Greenhouse-Geisser estimates of
sphericity, = .72). None of the other factors showed a significant main effect. Further, the ANOVA
revealed a marginally significant interaction effect between the factors task and domain, F(3,
34)=1.94, p<0.13, 2partial =.05. No other two-way interactions were found.
In addition, we conducted pairwise comparisons to check for differences between mechanical
engineers and architects comparing the 7 electrodes per hemisphere, task and half. Below we report
both on significant (p≤.005) and close to significant (p≤0.15) pairwise comparisons. The following
comparisons were marginally significant or significant: for the Pretask, second half, electrode FC6
(p=0.12) marginally significant in the right hemisphere. For Task 2, first half, electrodes F3(p=0.09),
FC5 (p=0.07) and O1 (p=0.08) marginally significant in the left hemisphere and in the second half,
electrode O2 (p=0.14) marginally significant in the right hemisphere. For Task 3, first half, electrodes
F4(p=0.05), T8(p=0.03) and P8(p=0.04), significant and AF4(p=0.09), F8(p=0.14) and O2 (p=0.07)
marginally significant in the right hemisphere and in the left hemisphere FC5 (p<0.01) and
AF3(p=0.05), significant and F3(p=0.12), F7(p=0.08) and O1(p0=.15) marginally significant. For
Task 3, second half, electrode F4(p=0.03), significant and T8(p=0.12) and O2 (p=0.13) marginally
significant in the right hemisphere and in the left hemisphere FC5 (p=0.04), significant and
AF3(p=0.15) and O1(p=0.11) marginally significant. For Task 4, first half, electrode FC6(p =0.12),
marginally significant in the right hemisphere and in the second half, electrode FC6(p =0.12)
marginally significant in the right hemisphere and T7(p=0.12), marginally significant in the left
hemisphere. There was no adjustment for multiple comparisons.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Results from this study demonstrate that it is possible to address the overall objectives of this research:
investigate the use of the EEG technique to distinguish design from problem-solving and identify
similarities and cognitive differences across the design domains. The results of this preliminary
analysis of the EEG data of the 36 participants show significant differences in the design
neurocognition of mechanical engineers and architects and provide initial support for hypothesis 1: the
design neurocognition of mechanical engineers and architects are different, particularly in Task 3
across domains and hemispheres. The layout Task 3 involves the enlargement of the problem and the
solution spaces as well as the opportunity of evaluating and reformulating the previous design
solutions. Architects show higher transformed power (Pow) and more distinct TRP differences from
the problem-solving task than do mechanical engineers. The neurocognitive temporal distributions of
activations between mechanical engineers and architects are significantly different providing initial
support for hypothesis 2: the neurocognitive temporal distributions of activations between mechanical
engineers and architects are significantly different, as mechanical engineers show more cognitive
effort in the electrodes of the left prefrontal cortex in the problem-solving and design tasks, and
architects show more cognitive effort in the electrodes of the temporal and occipital cortex of the right
hemisphere. The neurocognitive temporal distributions of activations between mechanical engineers
and architects are also significantly different providing initial support for hypothesis 3: the
neurocognitive temporal distributions of activations of mechanical engineers and architects are nonuniform, as mechanical engineers show little variation in the Pow and TRP between the problemsolving and design tasks, first and second halves while architects show higher variation particularly in
the problem-solving task and Task 3. Mechanical engineers show higher Pow and TRP difference
from the problem-solving task in the sketching task. On a qualitative level the current study shows
evidence of a distinct characteristic of increased Pow and TRP of design tasks from the reference
problem solving task across mechanical engineers and architects.
Further studies will focus on band waves filtering, detailed analysis addressing temporal changes in
neurocognition over time while designing and think-aloud protocol collected while measuring EEG
responses. The removal of effects due to speech will allow the temporal matching of design cognition
with neurophysiology, opening up a new research direction for neurocognitive research in design
studies.
