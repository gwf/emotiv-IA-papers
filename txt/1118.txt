Researchers are increasingly attempting to undertake electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in novel environments and
contexts outside of the traditional static laboratory setting. The term ‚Äúmobile EEG,‚Äù although commonly used to describe many
of these undertakings, is ambiguous, since it attempts to encompass a wide range of EEG device mobility, participant mobility,
and system specifications used across investigations. To provide quantitative parameters for ‚Äúmobile EEG,‚Äù we developed a
Categorisation of Mobile EEG (CoME) scheme based upon scoring of device mobility (ùê∑, from 0, off-body, to 5, head-mounted
with no additional equipment), participant mobility (ùëÉ, from 0, static, to 5, unconstrained running), system specification (ùëÜ, from
4, lowest, to 20, highest), and number of channels (ùê∂) used. The CoME scheme was applied to twenty-nine published mobile EEG
studies. Device mobility scores ranged from 0ùê∑ to 4ùê∑, participant mobility scores from 0ùëÉ to 4ùëÉ, and system specification scores
from 6ùëÜ to 17ùëÜ. The format of the scores for the four parameters is given, for example, as (2ùê∑, 4ùëÉ, 17ùëÜ, 32ùê∂) and readily enables
comparisons across studies. Our CoME scheme enables researchers to quantify the degree of device mobility, participant mobility,
and system specification used in their ‚Äúmobile EEG‚Äù investigations in a standardised way.

1. Introduction
Mobile or ambulatory EEG is an increasingly active area of
research utilised in a variety of applications and scenarios
such as outdoor urban environments [1, 2], sports activities
[3], and brain-computer interfacing [4‚Äì6]. Typically, participant movement during EEG recordings is discouraged
in order to reduce data artifacts. Mobile EEG seeks to
obtain recordings whilst movement is taking place, but its
success has been impeded by low system specification and
the mounting position of the EEG equipment. EEG systems
are now becoming available, which lend themselves to mobile
applications, although in general they have lower system
specifications when compared to static EEG systems.
Mobile EEG approaches include walking on a treadmill
whilst being tethered to immobile EEG equipment [7, 8],
walking outdoors with a wireless mobile EEG headset combined with a rucksack mounted PC [9], and being moved on

a trolley whilst wearing a virtual reality headset to provide
the sensation of movement [10]. These diverse approaches
cause ambiguity because they are all termed ‚Äúmobile EEG‚Äù
by researchers and yet exhibit wide variation in EEG device
mobility, participant mobility, and system specification.
One technique that has been used to address the problem
of misleading terminology in biomedical research and the
differing interpretation of some terms across practitioners is
categorisation based upon scales for parameters of interest
[11, 12]. An advantage of using a categorisation scheme is that
it standardises scores so they can be exchanged between practitioners with greater clarity. Since the term ‚Äúmobile EEG‚Äù
lacks this form of standardisation, a categorisation scheme
that encompasses the range of mobility of EEG equipment,
mobility of the participant, and the main features of EEG
system technical specification would provide researchers with
a standardised way of quantifying ‚Äúmobile EEG‚Äù as used in
studies.

2
A categorisation scheme for mobile EEG with sufficient
measure and usability would allow researchers to determine
the potential of specific EEG systems (and related equipment) and to guide development of new and more mobile
experimental protocols. By extension, it would also allow
EEG system developers to include in the design of systems
attributes that are of importance to the research community
as technology advances become possible. The literature contains a number of EEG system comparison studies where
usability [13, 14], signal quality [15], performance [16], and
electrode types [17] were compared. However, no categorisation schemes are currently available for ‚Äúmobile EEG.‚Äù
In the current investigation, we first reviewed twentynine published research investigations selected because they
either had ‚Äúmobile EEG‚Äù (or ‚Äúambulatory EEG‚Äù) in the
paper title and/or involved some form of participant mobility
whilst EEG recordings were being acquired. We extracted
the key features related to equipment used, equipment
mounting position, participant activity, and EEG system
specification. We next developed a novel categorisation
scheme for ‚Äúmobile EEG‚Äù based upon scoring the following
key parameters: device mobility, participant mobility, and
system specification. The specific parameter score descriptors
for device mobility and participant mobility were derived
from descriptions given in the twenty-nine ‚Äúmobile EEG‚Äù
published research investigations and one static EEG study.
The categorisation scheme was then applied retrospectively to
the thirty published studies, and a subset of these was taken
to illustrate the range of unique categorisation scores in the
parameters covered by the developed scoring scheme.

2. Development of the Categorisation of
Mobile EEG (CoME) Scheme
To develop descriptors for device mobility, participant mobility, and system specification, we reviewed thirty published
research studies. More specifically, we selected studies that
either had ‚Äúmobile EEG‚Äù (or ambulatory EEG) in the title
and/or involved some form of participant mobility whilst
EEG recordings were being taken. This enabled a range
of each parameter to be derived from these studies, along
with informative descriptors for each score. We selected one
investigation that used EEG in a static setting [20] to provide
contrast for the ‚Äúmobile EEG‚Äù studies and allow us to benchmark appropriate scales. This study was particularly suitable
as an example of static EEG since participant movement
was actively discouraged via training provided to participants
prior to recording.
The studies included are shown in Table 1 with details of
the year of publication, equipment mounting positions, EEG
system used, and participant activity during EEG recordings.
This information was used to derive both the device mobility
parameter scores and those of the participant mobility scores.
When information was either missing from the publication or
ambiguously described, this has been reported in the table.
2.1. Device Mobility. The device mobility score reflects
the mounting position (off-body, waist-mounted, or headmounted), along with the level of physical restriction placed

BioMed Research International
upon the participant by the EEG acquisition system. Figure 1
shows examples of the various mounting positions of the
device and associated equipment on the participant. Table 2
provides the device mobility scores and descriptors. The
mounting modalities taken from the published studies (see
Table 1) fit to the descriptors for scores of 0 to 4. The
descriptor for score of 5 is aspirational and is taking a logical
projection of what could be developed from the descriptor for
score of 4.
When all of the equipment is off-body mounted and
the participant is tethered to the equipment via cabling, it
is clear that the equipment is static and therefore is scored
as 0. When the EEG amplifier is mounted on the waist (or
the back) of a participant, movement-related artifacts are
likely because of electrode displacement [9, 40]. Leads cannot
be fastened to the participant sufficiently well to completely
remove electrode wire movement as this will then cause
restricted head movement. This coupled with the length
of electrode wires can result in increased electromagnetic
interference [41]. This provides scores of 1 and 2, where the
difference between these is the restriction placed upon the
participant. If additional equipment is placed in a rucksack on
the participant, this scores 1 as the participant is encumbered
with this additional load and in turn increases the weight
to be carried along with susceptibility to system movement
artifacts [42]. When no additional equipment is used, a
higher of score of 2 is used to reflect that the participant is
not encumbered with an additional load.
With EEG amplifiers that are completely head-mounted,
movement-related artifacts are reduced and head movements
are not restricted [9]. However, in general, the headset needs
to wirelessly link to another piece of equipment such as a
PC (see Table 1). This applies restrictions on the participant
which take the form of equipment placed in a rucksack
and therefore encumbering with an additional load or the
additional equipment is stored off-body and the participant
is constrained by the wireless connection range. Both of these
modalities score 3 as in both conditions participants are
constrained in some way. When the equipment is replaced
with a smartphone, which is inherently mobile, the participant is clearly far less constrained [21, 33] and this condition
scores 4. The next logical step is a modality where not
even a smartphone is required and this scores 5. Although
no example of such a system has been found, it has been
included, as future EEG system developments could well
achieve this level.
2.2. Participant Mobility. The scaling descriptors for participant mobility were based upon the activities described in the
published EEG studies (see Table 1). Table 3 gives the score
associated with each descriptor. This score reflects the level
of participant mobility in the context of instructions given by
the researcher to participants during a study. It is not unusual
for participants to perform more than one type of activity,
and in such cases we scored the activity involving the highest
participant mobility. From the list of studies, activities ranged
from static to treadmill running. The scores captured this
range from 0 to 4 with a score of 5 allowing for future work
where participants run unconstrained or are playing sport.

Lying, sitting, or standing still.
Lying, sitting, or standing with localised movement, for example, finger tapping or button pressing.
Constrained walking/cycling.
Unconstrained walking/cycling.
Walking and carrying, climbing stairs, and constrained running.
Unconstrained running and vigorous physical exercise or sport.

When movement is discouraged by researchers, this is
done in order to decrease the likelihood of movement-related
artifacts [25]. In protocols where participants were lying,
sitting, or standing still, a score of 0 was applied as the
participants are static and not mobile. In protocols where
participants were lying, sitting, or standing with localised
movement (e.g., finger tapping or button pressing), a score
of 1 was given to recognise the introduction of movement,
albeit localised. These localised movements are defined as
occurring without actual displacement of the whole body.
Treadmill walking, although constraining the participant
in terms of direction and pace of movement, is a further
increase upon localised movement and this type of activity
scores 2. Indoor or outdoor unconstrained walking scores
3 as the participant is not constrained in terms of direction
and pace, as is the case with a treadmill. The aspects of
environment such as indoor/outdoor or urban/rural whilst
having a sensory impact on the participant [1, 9] do not have
a quantifiable impact on their mobility and are therefore not
considered in the scoring or descriptors.
With treadmill running being the greatest level of mobility found in any of the studies in Table 1, a score of 4
was given to this level of activity. The same score was
also given for a study where the participants had to carry
packages of different sizes and weights (0.5 to 15 Kg) whilst
walking [2] and a study of epileptic outpatient data where
stair climbing was assumed to be the most mobile activity
[18]. The justification for scoring the two disparate activities
the same is that they both include activities that are more
than just walking. This allows a score of 5 to be applied
to unconstrained running or sport. No study was found to
include such a level of mobility but this score allows for this
to be captured in the future.
2.3. System Specification. EEG system specification is an
important consideration in mobile EEG research studies. A
system that is considered to be highly mobile may only have
a low system specification that adversely affects signal quality.
Conversely, a system that is considered to be static (offbody mounted) typically has a higher system specification.
Therefore, a system specification score was developed, in
addition to the device and participant mobility scores. Table 4
lists the EEG systems used in previously published studies
(see Table 1) along with the sampling rate, bit resolution,
number of channels, battery life, and electrode type. These
values were used to formulate scores to differentiate between
differing system specifications.

The system specification score consists of four attributes
added together, with each attribute ranging from 1 to 5. It
was decided not to start the system specification scale for
each parameter from 0 as the interpretation of this would
be unclear, and even the most basic device would have some
utility. It is also important to note that the impact of a device
encumbering the participant has been incorporated into the
device mobility score rather than the system specification
score since they are factors that affect participant mobility.
Since the emphasis is on mobility, the electrode type has
been captured as this impacts the likelihood and severity of
motion artifacts. A specific example is that of dry electrodes
that are much more difficult to secure to the participant
and movement in relation to the participant‚Äôs body occurs
more readily [43]. Gel-based electrodes provide improved
signal quality in comparison to saline [9]. The EEG systems
used in Table 4 can be broken down into either dry-, saline-,
or gel-based electrodes that are either passive or active and
unshielded or shielded. The scoring for this was 1 to 3 for the
dry, wet, and gel (or cream), respectively, with the addition of
one score each if the electrodes are active and shielded (see
Table 5). This provides a score range from 1 to 5; dry, passive,
and unshielded give a score of 1, and gel, active, and shielded
a score of 5.
Since the bit resolution impacts upon the accuracy of the
data recorded and the sampling rate of the system governs
the temporal resolution, we included both these parameters
in the system specification scoring. These are also attributes
that are usually reported by researchers. It should be noted
that the sampling rates recorded from the EEG systems used
in our thirty selected studies (see Table 1) fall into sequences
of either 125, 250, 500, . . . or 128, 256, 512, . . . because of the
underlying technology used. It was therefore decided that
125/128, 250/256, 500/512, . . . would score the same as their
temporal resolutions are very similar.
The reporting of the system‚Äôs specification in published
studies does not always include the attributes required to
be captured by our proposed scoring system. In these cases,
system manufacturer specification details were sought to
supplement the missing information. Where systems have
been developed and therefore manufacturer specification
details do not exist, a range of possible scores is reported to
encompass the potential variation in specification score.
Battery life is an important consideration of mobile EEG.
For an EEG system to be fully mobile, it has to be batterypowered, and the charge life of the battery directly governs the
period of active monitoring that can take place [44]. A battery

life attribute was included in the system specification score so
duration of use could be captured, and where equipment was
not battery-powered, this was also reported.
A rating scale of 1 to 5 for each system specification
attribute was used. The range for each attribute is from the
lowest used in commercially available systems up to the
highest and beyond to cover future expected technological
developments. The score assigned for each attribute of the
system specification is dictated by the actual bit resolution,
sampling rate, battery life, and electrode type used in the
research investigation. Table 6 shows the system attributes
and scoring of the system specification.
Scores for bit resolution, sampling rate, battery life, and
electrode type were added together to form a single combined
total score for system specification (ùëÜ) out of a maximum
possible score of 20. For example, a bit resolution of 14,
sampling rate of 512 Hz, a battery life of 8 hours, and active
shielded gel electrodes would give a total system specification
score of 1 + 3 + 2 + 5 = 11ùëÜ.
2.4. Number of Channels. To develop a scoring scale for the
number of channels used in an EEG study, many factors
would have to be considered which relate to the specific
type of investigation being undertaken. The type of analysis
to be performed quite often necessitates a certain number
of channels for validity, such as distributed source reconstruction [45] and spatial filtering methods [46]. Although,
in general, the range of possible analysis approaches systematically increases with spatial densities and therefore a
scale could be created on such a basis, the positioning of the
electrodes presents another aspect of the problem. A steadystate visual evoked potentials experiment using electrodes
only located posteriorly is different from an imagined motor
activity experiment that uses electrodes localised anteriorly.
Therefore, in our categorisation scheme, we opted to report
the number of channels (ùê∂) separately, for example, 32ùê∂.

3. Application of the Categorisation of Mobile
EEG (CoME) Scheme
We applied our developed Categorisation of Mobile EEG
(CoME) scheme to all thirty published research studies listed
in Table 1. The specification score (ùëÜ) for each EEG system
(bit resolution, sampling rate, battery life, and electrode type)
is presented in Table 7. The scores for device mobility (ùê∑),
participant mobility (ùëÉ), total score for system specification
(ùëÜ), and number of channels (ùê∂) are presented in Table 8.
Figure 2 presents in a 3D plot the ùê∑, ùëÉ, and ùëÜ scores for
a selected subset of the thirty studies (comprising sixteen
studies), which illustrate the range of specific scores obtained
using our CoME scheme. For each of the selected studies,

we summarize below the EEG equipment and participant
activity, the resultant ùê∑, ùëÉ, and ùëÜ scores, number of channels
used, and the final categorisation score:
3.1. ActiveTwo-1 (BioSemi, Netherlands). Davies and Gavin
[20] used an off-body mounted system in which participants
were seated and therefore were static. Consequently, device
mobility (ùê∑) and participant mobility (ùëÉ) were ranked at the
lowest point of each scale (0ùê∑ and 0ùëÉ). This study used a
BioSemi ActiveTwo EEG system with recordings made using
24-bit sampling resolution (score = 4), at a sampling rate of
1024 Hz (score = 4) and battery life of 10 hours (score = 3)
and electrodes were active, shielded, and gel-based (score =
5), yielding a system score of 16ùëÜ. Since 32 channels were used,
the total score for the BioSemi ActiveTwo system as used in
this study was (0ùê∑, 0ùëÉ, 16ùëÜ, 32ùê∂).
3.2. ActiveTwo-3 (BioSemi, Netherlands). The study by Gwin
et al. [25] also used a BioSemi ActiveTwo system but
involved participants walking and running on a treadmill
with the EEG acquisition equipment mounted off-body on
a rack above the treadmill. This configuration yields a device
mobility score of 0ùê∑. The treadmill running of the participant
scored 4ùëÉ. The system score is 15ùëÜ which is different from
Davies and Gavin [20] because of the lower sampling rate
of 512 Hz (score = 3). However, the number of channels used
was greater at 248 channels. The overall score is (0ùê∑, 4ùëÉ, 15ùëÜ,
248ùê∂).
3.3. ActiveTwo-4 (BioSemi, Netherlands). Motion capture was
used in conjunction with EEG whilst participants played a
digital piano in a study by Maidhof et al. [31]. A BioSemi
ActiveTwo system was used but this time with a sampling rate
of 8192 Hz (score = 5), which combines with the bit resolution,
battery life, and electrode type to form a score of 17ùëÜ. The
device was mounted off-body and scores 0ùê∑. The participants
were seated and were performing localised movement which
scores as 1ùëÉ. The number of channels used was 32, making the
overall score (0ùê∑, 1ùëÉ, 17ùëÜ, 32ùê∂).
3.4. actiCHamp (Brain Vision, USA). User-driven treadmill
walking was an investigation undertaken by Bulea et al.
[19]. A figure shows participants wearing an EEG cap that
is then wired to one of several back-mounted pieces of
equipment. This arrangement has been scored as 1ùê∑, and
because the study used treadmill walking, the score for
participant mobility was 2ùëÉ. The EEG system consisted of 24bit sampling (score = 4), 500 Hz sampling frequency (score =
3), and battery life of 24 hours (score = 4) summed to form
a score of 16ùëÜ. 64 channels of EEG were used for this study,
providing a combined score of (1ùê∑, 2ùëÉ, 16ùëÜ, 64ùê∂).
3.5. asalab (ANT Neuro, Netherlands). Ehinger et al. [10]
used the term ‚Äúmobile EEG study‚Äù to describe participants
moving with a trolley. The trolley was used to mount all of
the equipment in a static EEG system format. Since the device
was mounted off-body (on the trolley), it was given a score
of 0ùê∑ for device mobility. As part of the study, participants
moved by pushing the trolley within guide rails, and a score

system specification was 24-bit resolution (score = 4), with a
1024 Hz sampling rate (score = 4) and battery life of 10 hours
(score = 3), and active, shielded, gel electrodes were used
(score = 5), combining to give 16ùëÜ. Since 128 EEG channels
were used, the overall score was (0ùê∑, 2ùëÉ, 16ùëÜ, 128ùê∂).

connection, it was given a score of 3ùê∑. The participants were
seated on fixed exercise cycles during the study which scored
2ùëÉ. The B-Alert system specification, as used, consisted of a
16-bit sampling resolution (score = 2), 256 Hz sampling rate
(score = 2), and battery life of 8 hours (score = 2), and passive
shielded conductive cream-based electrodes were used (score
= 4), combining to give 10ùëÜ. Overall score including the 20
channels‚Äô score was (3ùê∑, 2ùëÉ, 10ùëÜ, 20ùê∂).
3.7. BrainAmp-1 (Brain Products, Germany). Participants
stood in front of a projection screen and had to point, in
a study by Jungnickel and Gramann [26]. The EEG system
is placed in a backpack and consequently scores 1ùê∑. The
participants in this study were standing still and pointing,
which is a localised movement and scores 1ùëÉ. The BrainAmp
system specification, as used, consisted of a 16-bit sampling
resolution (score = 2), 500 Hz sampling rate (score = 3), and
battery life of 30 hours (score = 5), and active, shielded, gelbased electrodes were used (score = 5), combining to give 15ùëÜ.
The overall score including the 156 channels‚Äô score was (1ùê∑,
1ùëÉ, 15ùëÜ, 156ùê∂).
3.8. BrainAmp-3 (Brain Products, Germany). Wascher et al.
[2] also used a BrainAmp EEG system in a study that
recorded EEG whilst participants carried packages of various
weights (0.5 to 15 Kg) whilst walking. The EEG equipment
was mounted on the participants in a belt bag located
at their lower back and scored 1ùê∑. A score of 4ùëÉ was
attributed to the activity carried out by participants since it
went beyond unconstrained walking with the inclusion of
package carrying. The system score is 16ùëÜ, which is different
from Jungnickel and Gramann [26], because of the higher
sampling rate of 1000 Hz (score = 4). The combination of
scores provides an overall score of (1ùê∑, 4ùëÉ, 16ùëÜ, 28ùê∂).
3.9. MindWave (NeuroSky, USA). Participants were seated
during a driving simulation study undertaken by Liu et al.
[30]. They used a head-mounted MindWave system that
requires a wirelessly linked PC to process and store the EEG
data. The device mobility was scored as 3ùê∑ as the laptop/PC
restricts the range of the participants. Since the participants
were undertaking a seated driving simulation task in which
small amounts of localised physical movement were involved,
it was scored as 1ùëÉ. The MindWave system has a 16-bit
sampling resolution (score = 2), a 500 Hz sampling rate (score
= 3), and battery life of 10 hours (score = 3) with a dry, passive,
shielded electrode (score = 2) to give a combined score of 10ùëÜ.
The overall score for this study with a single channel used was
(3ùê∑, 1ùëÉ, 10ùëÜ, 1ùê∂).
3.10. Mobita (TMSi, Netherlands). The Mobita EEG system
was evaluated by Dutch neurologists in a study by Askamp
and van Putten [18]. The device was waist-mounted and
did not require any additional equipment and thus scored
2ùê∑. Since participants in the study were outpatients, it
was assumed that everyday home activities would be the
type of activities undertaken. Stair climbing was therefore
considered the most mobile of activities within a home
environment and so scored 4ùëÉ. The EEG system provided a

11
24-bit sampling resolution (score = 4), a 2000 Hz sampling
rate (score = 5), and battery life of 19 hours (score = 4) with
gel-based, passive, shielded electrodes (score = 4) to give a
combined score of 17ùëÜ. The overall score for this study with
32 EEG channels used was (2ùê∑, 4ùëÉ, 17ùëÜ, 32ùê∂).
3.11. Oldenburg Hybrid-1 (Modified Emotiv, USA). Debener et
al. [9] undertook a study in which participants walked outside
unconstrained. This investigation used what is referred to
as the Oldenburg system, comprised of the data acquisition
electronics from an EPOC system fitted to an electrode cap
(Easycap, Germany). This modified system was developed in
an attempt to increase data quality by improving electrode
connection to the participant‚Äôs scalp. However, the resulting data recordings are still limited by the comparatively
low system specification of the acquisition electronics. The
device mobility was scored as 3ùê∑ since the EEG acquisition
equipment was in a rucksack mounted on the participant.
This study scored relatively high for participant mobility (3ùëÉ)
as participants were walking outside (constrained only by
the weight of the rucksack-housed laptop). The acquisition
electronics are from an EPOC EEG system with a 14-bit
resolution (score = 1), sampling rate of 128 Hz (score = 1),
and battery life of 6 hours (score = 2) with the upgrade of
electrodes to being gel-based, passive, and shielded (score =
4), giving the score of 8ùëÜ. The system was still limited to 14
channels and our categorisation gave an overall score of (3ùê∑,
3ùëÉ, 8ùëÜ, 14ùê∂).
3.12. Oldenburg Hybrid-2 (Modified Emotiv, USA). De Vos et
al. [15] compared the performance of the Oldenburg Hybrid
to that of a traditional amplifier in a seated BCI speller
task. Although the participants were not required to carry
additional equipment in a rucksack, they were still limited
by the range of the wireless link to a corresponding PC
and therefore scored 3ùê∑. With the participants being seated
whilst performing a visual ERP speller task, they were seated
without moving and gain a score of 0ùëÉ. The acquisition
electronics and electrode types remain the same as with
Debener et al. [9] and therefore score 8ùëÜ. The system again
has 14 channels with the categorisation score becoming (3ùê∑,
0ùëÉ, 8ùëÜ, 14ùê∂).
3.13. Penso (Noncommercial). Gargiulo et al. [24] studied
seated participants performing imagined motor activity. They
built their own EEG system that was waist-mounted and
scored 2ùê∑. Since the participants were seated and physical
movement was limited to eyes opening and closing and
button pressing, a score of 1ùëÉ was assigned. Their EEG system
provided them with 16-bit sampling resolution (score = 2) and
a 256 Hz sampling rate (score = 2). The battery life was not
mentioned in the publication and since it is not a commercial
product, commercial documentation could not be used. A
score of 1 was given, and along with electrodes that were
dry, passive, and shielded (score = 2), this gave a score for
the system specification of 7ùëÜ, and with 8 EEG channels, the
overall score was (2ùê∑, 1ùëÉ, 7ùëÜ, 8ùê∂).
3.14. Polymate AP216 (TEAC Corp., Japan). Lotte et al.
[5] studied EEG recordings from participants performing

12
corridor walking. The EEG system and a laptop were stored in
a backpack which the participants wore and scored 1ùê∑. Since
the participants were walking in an unconstrained manner,
this was scored as 3ùëÉ. The Polymate EEG system provided
them with 16-bit sampling resolution (score = 2), a 1000 Hz
sampling rate (score = 4), battery life of 18 hours (score
= 4), and active, shielded, gel-based electrodes (score = 5)
summed to give 15ùëÜ. 3 channels were used during this study
and contribute to the overall score of (1ùê∑, 3ùëÉ, 15ùëÜ, 3ùê∂).
3.15. SMARTING-1 (mBrainTrain, Belgrade, Serbia). Debener
et al. [21] used a mobile EEG system with participants
seated indoors. The emphasis was on the unobtrusive flexible
printed electrodes they had used which were located around
the ears. EEG recordings were made using SMARTING,
which is a head-mounted system that transmits data wirelessly to a smartphone or PC. Since a smartphone was used in
their study, the device mobility scored 4ùê∑. The participants‚Äô
movement was essentially static whilst seated indoors when
recordings took place and scored 0ùëÉ. The SMARTING EEG
system provided the researchers with samples at 24-bit
sampling resolution (score = 4), a sampling rate of 500 Hz
(score = 3), battery life of 5 hours (score = 2), and gel-based,
passive, and unshielded electrodes (score = 3), giving 12ùëÜ. The
overall score with 16 EEG channels used was (4ùê∑, 0ùëÉ, 12ùëÜ,
16ùê∂).
3.16. Varioport (Becker Meditec, Germany). Doppelmayr et
al. [22] performed static EEG recordings during rest periods
in ultralong running events. They also performed EEG
recordings with participants walking slowly with eyes closed
(hand-led by a member of support crew), and it is this part
of the study which was scored since it contained the most
physical movement. EEG recordings were made using a light
weight, waist-mounted system called Varioport which scored
2ùê∑. The participants‚Äô movement involved periods of slow
walking and scored 3ùëÉ. The Varioport EEG system provided
the researchers with samples at 16-bit sampling resolution
(score = 2), a sampling rate of 2000 Hz (score = 5), and battery
life of 96 hours (score = 5). No information regarding the type
of electrodes used in the study is supplied in the publication,
and attempts made to find this missing information via
manufacturer documentation have also failed to help. A score
was applied by taking the only information available (passive)
and applying the lowest scores for the unknown parameters
(score = 3). A total score of 13ùëÜ is given but this could be
higher with a score range of 13‚Äì17ùëÜ. With Varioport being
used to provide 10 channels, the overall score was (2ùê∑, 3ùëÉ,
13‚Äì17ùëÜ, 10ùê∂).

4. Discussion
In the current investigation, we have reviewed thirty published research investigations from which we have developed
a novel categorisation scheme for ‚Äúmobile EEG‚Äù based
upon scores of the parameters, device mobility, participant
mobility, and system specification, whilst also reporting the
number of channels used. The parameter score descriptors
were derived following review of thirty published research

BioMed Research International
investigations. The categorisation scheme was then applied
retrospectively to all thirty published studies and a subset
of these (sixteen studies) was taken to illustrate the range of
specific categorisation scores in the parameters covered by the
developed scoring system.
The results show a broad range in the scores for device
mobility, participant mobility, and system specification. Our
results highlight the need for such a categorisation scheme
to be adopted and utilised by researchers, as it provides a
quantitative and more accurate description than the vague
term ‚Äúmobile EEG.‚Äù In addition, the categorisation has been
designed to provide the scores in a convenient format. This
allows researchers to readily capture and compare the actual
meaning of the term ‚Äúmobile EEG‚Äù in the context of a specific
researcher‚Äôs study. We encourage researchers to apply our
categorisation scheme to their own mobile EEG systems and
research contexts when using the ambiguous term, ‚Äúmobile
EEG,‚Äù in their publications and reports. It should be noted
that users of our categorisation scheme should not equate
lower or higher scores with subjective judgements. Our
intention is only to quantify the level of device mobility,
participant mobility, system specification, and number of
channels used in a comparable way across studies.
Based upon our categorisation scores of the thirty published studies, there may be an indication that EEG systems
with higher system specification scores are associated with
lower scores for device mobility. For example, the studies by
Maidhof et al. [31] and Ehinger et al. [10] have higher device
specification scores of 17ùëÜ and 16ùëÜ, respectively, but lower
scores for device mobility of 0ùê∑. In contrast, EEG systems
with lower scores for system specification scored higher for
device mobility. For example, the studies by Debener et al. [9]
and Stopczynski et al. [33, 39] scored 8ùëÜ and 6ùëÜ, respectively,
for system specification but scored 3ùê∑ and 4ùê∑, respectively,
for device mobility. Our developed CoME scheme could
enable researchers, in future investigations using a larger
number of included studies, to determine whether there
are any significant relationships between device mobility,
participant mobility and system specification.
Our categorisation scoring scheme will aid in the development of new mobile EEG systems, by both research and
commercial communities, by making it possible to clearly
identify quantifiable improvements and to clarify reporting of
‚Äúmobile EEG‚Äù in publications. Fully head-mounted EEG systems are especially appropriate for recordings to be acquired
in mobile settings. Combining such a head-mounted system
with a smartphone would give high scores for device and
participant mobility.
Our categorisation scheme is capable of informing investigators of the potential for increasing device and participant
mobility and thereby highlighting future research possibilities. For example, in the study by Gargiulo et al. [24], the
imagined motor activity could be undertaken whilst participants walk, as the device mobility score of 2ùê∑, in principle,
allows a higher level of mobility to be introduced. In the
studies by Stopczynski et al. [33, 39], using the EPOC system,
device mobility scores were 4ùê∑, but since the investigation
involved participants sitting still, the participants‚Äô mobility
scores were limited to 0ùëÉ. This indicates that there is a

BioMed Research International
potential for additional investigations to be designed in which
participants‚Äô mobility could be introduced or increased. A
further example is in the studies by Zink et al. [38] and
Debener et al. [21] who used the SMARTING system. If Zink
et al. [38] were to use a smartphone instead of a PC, as in the
study by Debener et al. [21], to record the transmitted data,
then the study score for device mobility would increase from
3ùê∑ to 4ùê∑ to enable novel protocols.
Another usage of our categorisation scheme by
researchers could be in determining the degree of device
mobility, participant mobility, system specification, and
number of channels used within and between research
investigations. To better facilitate this process, we have
included a Categorisation of Mobile EEG (CoME)
form in the Supplementary Material available online at
https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/5496196. It is hoped by including
this easy-to-use resource that researchers will be encouraged
to quantify their research in terms of the categories covered.
From the perspective of our categorisation scheme, an ideal
‚Äúmobile EEG‚Äù system would score a maximum of (5ùê∑, 5ùëÉ,
20ùëÜ) and represents a fully head-mounted system that does
not require additional equipment for data recording. The
participant would be able to undertake extreme activities
such as unconstrained running, and the system specification
would be greater than 24-bit resolution and greater than
1000 Hz sampling with a battery life of more than 24 hours.
We could find no study and EEG system combination with
this level of device and participant mobility coupled with
this level of system specification. Our expectation is that,
given the pace of current developments, the higher scores for
system and device/participant mobility descriptors are likely
to be achievable in the foreseeable future.
There are two ways in which the CoME scheme can be
applied: (1) retrospectively and (2) prospectively. We applied
it retrospectively to thirty published studies and scored
according to what the research reported. There is usually a
reason why researchers have not maximised the settings. This
could also relate to the equipment used as some systems are
modular and, in order to use the equipment in a certain way,
compromises may have been made. If the scheme is used
to plan a study and therefore the scheme is to be applied
prospectively, a system‚Äôs maximum settings would be scored.
4.1. Limitations of the CoME Scheme. In the CoME scheme,
the total system specification is a combined score reflecting
the electrode type, bit resolution, sampling rate, and battery
life. Our recommendation is that researchers consider both
the total system specification score and the individual scores
for these parameters. It is possible that the CoME system
specification score is not fully reflective of a researchers‚Äô
expected change in EEG signal quality within a certain
research context. For instance, an improvement in systems
specification when using active electrodes instead of passive
ones may be considered by a researcher to represent an
increase in signal quality, but, using the CoME scheme,
there would only be a score change from 0 to 1. However,
when gel-based electrodes with wires of minimal length and
associated electronics are in close proximity (head-mounted
configuration), using active electrodes may not produce an

13
increase in signal quality and a CoME score allocation of one
may be considered as high.
There are potentially a wide range of system specification
parameters that we could have included such as impedance
and wireless connection range but we opted to only include
bit resolution, sampling rate, battery life, and electrode
type in our categorisation scheme. We included these four
attributes as they are usually reported in published EEG
research studies or can be found with relative ease from
manufacturers‚Äô documentation. Some publications do not
report details of the EEG system used and corresponding
settings. We recommend that research investigators, as part
of good publication practice, report at least the following
parameters: EEG system name, EEG system manufacturer
(where appropriate), bit resolution, sampling rate, battery life,
electrode type, and number of channels used.
For electrode impedance, published research studies typically only provide a general statement such as ‚Äúimpedance was
kept below 5 kŒ©‚Äù rather than giving a precise value for each
channel and for each participant. In addition, impedance
is a dynamic variable that changes throughout the course
of a study and it is assumed that researchers will deal
with this as a matter of course when obtaining research
data fit for publication. Another reason for selecting the
parameters chosen is that a scoring scale can be generated
with increasing gradations; for example, increasing sampling
rate gives a higher score. Such an increasing gradation scale
is not possible to generate for different electrode metal types
(tin versus silver versus gold), where the application rather
than the level of mobility of participants is the main factor of
consideration.
Although our categorisation scheme has been developed
from the perspective of the researcher and has descriptors
that cover EEG equipment mobility, participant mobility, and
system specification, it does not consider the perspective of
the participant. It is possible that the participant may have
experienced, for example, some discomfort related to the
EEG equipment that the researchers had been unaware of
or that items of equipment were encumbering during the
investigation. Participants could be asked to provide scores
for comfort, weight, and aesthetic form and these could be
added to our categorisation scheme. For example, the study
by Hairston et al. [13], which utilised participant-reported
comfort ratings for EEG systems (1 = very comfortable, 7 =
very uncomfortable), could potentially be incorporated into
our categorisation scheme. The subjectivity of comfort assessments would be a problem when developing a participantfocused scoring system using descriptors, particularly as participant assessments may change over time. The addition of
several participant-focused parameters to our categorisation
scheme would make the format less concise and comparisons
more difficult. Perhaps a separate participant categorisation
scheme could be developed to address these issues, but it
would have to accurately capture and quantify participant
perspectives, which are rarely sought.

5. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have reviewed thirty published research
studies that use the term ‚Äúmobile EEG‚Äù or contain participant

14
mobility whilst EEG is being acquired. From this review,
we developed a categorisation scheme for ‚Äúmobile EEG‚Äù
studies based upon scoring for device mobility, participant
mobility, system specification, and number of channels used
in order to remove the inherent ambiguity in the way this
term is used by researchers. The results of applying our
categorisation scheme retrospectively to a range of published
researches shows that it captures the degree to which the EEG
equipment is mobile, the degree of participants‚Äô movement
in the study, the main attributes of the system specification
which are readily available, and the number of channels used.
The format of the resultant scores is concise and enables
convenient comparison across different research studies. Our
categorisation of EEG (CoME) form is intended to be a useful
aid for researchers to conveniently categorise their mobile
EEG studies as well as in the design and development of
mobile EEG equipment (see the supplementary material).
