BCI to allow a rapid action of humans controlling, with
different levels of involvement, a deployed platform, which
can be a sub-system on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV),
or the UAV itself. For space unmanned systems working
under human command, a number of potential applications
of BCI have been proposed [10], [11], such as the control
of a future spacecraft [12]. Another possible application is
an early-alarm system for manned space-missions which, in
case of an emergency, activates an emergency response based
on the astronauts brain-responses. In this scenario the time
and accuracy of the decision making is critical, so using a
CBCI would bring shorter and more reliable decision making [13], [1]. The particular application of target identificatio
is extremely relevant to games (in this case in particular
collaborative games), and of course, to military scenarios.

we explore, from a broad perspective, how the collaboration of a
group of people can increase the performance on a simple target
identificatio task. To this end, we requested a group of people to
identify the location and color of a sequence of targets appearing
on the screen and measured the time and accuracy of the
response. The individual results are compared to a collective
identificatio result determined by simple majority voting, with
random choice in case of drawn. The results are promising, as

B. Votation mechanism
The voting mechanism is simple majority. We consider the
individual responses of the subjects as votes, and the collective
response is assigned to be the identif cation that gathers most
votes. In this way if, for instance, two subjects identify
the target as red, and one subject as green, the collective
response is red. This study carried out an experiment with
two identif cation tasks: location and color. Despite the are

IV. T IME TO IDENTIFY THE TARGET
The decision time plays a critical role in some application
domains and, therefore, should be taken into account. However,
the existence of two tasks in the experiment poses a diff culty
that has to be addressed. The time consumed to perform both
tasks is not a good choice because the subject might fail giving
an answer to one of the tasks and, as a consequence, the time
measure would be invalid, giving an unrealistic perspective.
So, instead of using the time used to perform both tasks, we
measure time of the f rst response which is the f rst keystroke;
in other words, we measure the RT.
In total, there were 6x30 = 180 targets, and, as Table II
shows, 65 empty responses in our experiments, which gives
115 valid time measurements. The summary statistics of the
RT times are the following ones:
Min. 1st Qu. Median
456.0 589.0
680.0

Mean
678.0

3rd Qu. Max.
772.5
953.0

We should remark that these RTs are measured for each
target, while the RTs shown in Table II are average values
computed for each subject. The histogram in Fig. 3 completes
the description of the RT showing that its distribution is quite
symmetrical with its mean placed on 680ms. It is clear that
there is a lower bound to the RT, which in our data is 456ms;
the upper limit is imposed by the time window in which the
subjects could provide the identif cation, in this case 1000ms.
The histogram in Fig. 3 shows the presence of a lower bound
to the time required by the collective target identif cation.
Collective identif cation requires at least this time in order to
gather the individual responses. In order to better understand
this relationship, we have plotted Fig. 4, which relates the
accuracy and number of empty responses with the RT. To
plot Fig. 4, we computed the accuracy of the collective
identif cation with the responses given with a RT less than a
value t0 . Then, this process was repeated for different values
of t0 between 200 and 1000ms.
As hypothesized, Fig. 4 shows that there are no answers
until 450ms, and therefore, the accuracy before that moment is
zero. After that, the subjects begin to provide answers (see the

bottom row of Fig. 4) and subsequently the accuracy begins to
increase with time, at a constant rate until a saturation point. In
this point almost all the responses needed to identify the target
accurately are available, but the new responses do not improve
the performance. We also can observe some oscillations in the
accuracy generated by the random choice done in case of draw.
Figure 4 also shows the presence of two boundaries in order
to get an accurate identif cation with time constrains: A lower
boundary given by the minimum RT and an upper boundary
that limits the accuracy improvement. Between these two
boundaries, there is a trade-off, a faster collective identif cation
is feasible at a cost of a lower accuracy; and the opposite,
a more accurate identif cation can be done if more time is
allowed.
These experiments show that there are at least two factors
that inf uence the identif cation accuracy: number of subjects
and time window. However, these factors are not independent,
a larger window time enables getting more responses. To
better understand their relationship, we plotted the accuracy
versus the number of subjects and time following the same
procedure previously described; simply we have introduced
both variables in the plot. The result is in Fig. 5.
Figure 5 relates the accuracy to the number of subjects
and time. The behavior is as expected. The boundaries of
the response time are clear in the f gure. The lower boundary
remains constant regardless of the number of subjects involved
in the identif cation; on the contrary, the upper boundary
depends on the number of subjects, with limits, including that
the involvement of more subjects decreases the time required
to achieve a perfect accuracy, suggesting that we can achieve

V. F INE - GRAIN ANALYSIS
In this section we aim to analyze the results individually,
studying the identif cation accuracy depending on each target
and subject. This will provide a fine-grain data that would
allow us a deeper understanding of the results.
Figure 6 relates the median RT and the accuracy of each
subject. We could expect a positive correlation between time
and accuracy, those subjects that require more time should
be able to identify better the target. However, our data do
not support this hypothesis; on the contrary, it shows a lack
of pattern in the data. This result contradicts the one reported
by [14] showing a linear relationship between the accuracy and
median RT. An explication to this discrepancy can be found in
the mechanical part of our experiment. In opposition to [14],
in our experiment the subjects had to provide a mechanical
response, while [14] captures the ERP signal directly from the
brain cortex. The lack of correlation between accuracy and
reaction time observed in our experiment suggests that the
mechanical response induces variability to the RT, probably

better identif cation accuracy in less time.
Based on these results, we conclude that there is a lower
boundary of around 450ms to the identif cation time given
by the minimum time required by the users to perceive
the target, process it mentally, and provide the mechanical
response. Beyond a saturation point, providing more time does
not increase the accuracy signif cantly. All these results have
considered average values; in the following section we study
the responses individually.

Fig. 7. Number of correct, incorrect and empty responses for location (left)

The result of the identif cation for each target is visualized in
Fig. 7. Both tasks, the choice of location and color, give similar
results: the loss of accuracy is the result of empty responses
more so than the incorrect identif cations. In addition, the
f gure suggests that the results get worse in targets presented
towards the end; in particular, there are more empty responses
there than in the beginning of the sequence. The probable
cause is fatigue, or possibly a reduced excitement with the
task. To avoid this, one may split the target series into two or
three shorter ones.

Its color indicates the target color, which is green, yellow
or red; green vertical lines indicate a 200 ms pause. The
bad adherence of some electrodes introduced an unacceptable
amount of noise to the signal in some channels, which were
ignored. The S/N ratio I poor, however, channel F4 clearly
shows periodic peaks that, interestingly, coincide in time with
the appearance of the target. This correlation appears along
all the data sequence, as well as along all the sequence it
correlates closely the emergence of the stimuli.
While this research is not yet completed, the magnitude of
the peaks in channel F4 indicates, however, that it is unlikely
to be EEG. As F4 is placed on the frontal bone, close to the
eye, this gives credence to another explanation of the origin of
this signal, which is extraocular or frontal muscles. To test this
hypothesis, we can compare F4 to its symmetrical channel F3,
but the result of this comparison is not conclusive. F3 presents
much noise, and the peaks are not so clear, however, it seems
to contain some peaks, for example, around t = 11s, but this is
unclear so far. Another conjecture that perhaps could explain
the F4 periodic signal is that the peaks had some connection
with the heartbeats; this will be easily verif able in a future
experiment, yet unfortunately current data recording stopped
immediately after the last target, without any quiet period.
