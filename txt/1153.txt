Numerous studies have revealed that meditative movement changes brain activity and
improves the cognitive function of adults. However, there is still insufficient data on
whether meditative movement contributes to the cognitive function of adolescents
whose brain is still under development. Therefore, this study aimed to uncover the
effects of meditative movement on the cognitive performance and its relation with brain
activity in adolescents. Forty healthy adolescent participants (mean age of 17∼18)
were randomly allocated into two groups: meditative movement and control group.
The meditative movement group was instructed to perform the meditative movement,
twice a day for 9 min each, for a duration of 3 weeks. During the same time of the
day, the control group was instructed to rest under the same condition. To measure
changes in cognitive abilities, a dual n-back task was performed before and after the
intervention and analyzed by repeated two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). During
the task, electroencephalogram signals were collected to find the relation of brain activity
with working memory performance and was analyzed by regression analysis. A repeated
two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction showed that working memory performance
was significantly increased by meditative movement compared with the retest effect.
Based on regression analysis, the amplitude of high-beta rhythm in the F3 channel
showed a significant correlation with dual n-back score in the experimental group after
the intervention, while there was no correlation in the control group. Our results suggest
that meditative movement improves the performance of working memory, which is
related to brain activity in adolescents.

INTRODUCTION
Working memory is a subcomponent of executive function (Baddeley, 1992). Executive control
is described as a subset of processes involved in the selection, scheduling, and coordination of
computational processes underlying perception, memory, and action (Meyer and Kieras, 1997).
Working memory consists of the real-time processing and retention of incoming information using

Meditative Movement and Working Memory

The recording of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity used
to study brain functionality has been extensively investigated
during application of the n-back task. In addition, neural
oscillations at specific frequencies have been shown to be
related to specific cognitive processes. Theta power has been
reported to play an important role in working memory (Sammer
et al., 2007). In particular, theta activity has been reported
to be associated with short-term memory tasks (Klimesch,
1996), maintenance (Sarnthein et al., 1998), and information
retrieval (Klimesch et al., 2001). Furthermore, theta power
involved in working memory has shown potential to be an
EEG biomarker that can estimate an individual’s intelligence
(Luo and Zhou, 2020). The role of alpha power has been
associated with top-down functions (Von Stein et al., 2000;
Palva and Palva, 2007; Sauseng et al., 2009a,b). However,
in contrast to theta activity, alpha activity seems to reflect
inhibitory activity (Romei et al., 2008; Sauseng et al., 2009a).
Beta power increases as the working memory load increases
(Deiber et al., 2007; Chen and Huang, 2016); however, increased
working memory load has also been associated with beta
desynchronization (Bočková et al., 2007; Krause et al., 2010).
Beta power has been suggested to be associated with increased
working memory performance due to the more effective filtering
of irrelevant information (Zanto and Gazzaley, 2009). Therefore,
the results of neural oscillation analyses can be used to estimate
the changes in cognitive function as a result of meditation
practice in our study.
In the current work, we hypothesized that meditative
movement may increase the working memory performance of
adolescents and the increase of working memory performance
may correlate with increase of theta power, decrease of alpha
power, and increase or decrease of beta power in adolescent
brains. To this end, we randomly allocated 40 participants
into either a meditative movement or control group. For the
meditative movement group, participants were guided to practice
meditative movement for 9 min per session, 2 sessions per
day, for 3 weeks. For the control group, participants were
guided to relax for the same time. Before and after the
intervention, working memory performance was measured by
scores of dual n-back task and EEG was measured to detect
simultaneous brain activity. In the current research, meditative
movement for adolescents improved working memory but not
with other frequencies.

temporary storage. It affects the shifting of information from
short-term memory to long-term memory. Previous studies of
working memory and other higher-order cognitive functions
have found that these processes continue to mature during late
adolescence (Brahmbhatt et al., 2008; Thomason et al., 2009;
Andre et al., 2016), when they are critical for the successful
maturation of one’s learning and memory into adulthood (Marosi
et al., 1992; Ramscar and Gitcho, 2007).
In childhood and adolescence, the brain undergoes
multifaceted and regionally differentiated maturational
processes. Cognitive development in childhood and adolescence
is achieved through a dynamic interaction between structural
maturation and learning (Lebel and Beaulieu, 2011). In brain
mapping research of normal children, brain growth is most
prominent in frontal and occipital regions and changes in
cortical thickness are highly significant in the dorsomedial
prefrontal cortex (Sowell et al., 2004). A recent study also found
that improvement in the working memory of children and
adolescents were associated with cortical volume reduction in
brain area, including bilateral prefrontal regions, but does not
correlate with gender and age (Tamnes et al., 2013). In particular,
frontotemporal connections have been shown to mature even
after 20 years of age, and were reported to develop more slowly
than any other region (Lebel et al., 2008). Significant clusters
were identified in the white matter of the frontal and temporal
lobes that are associated with working memory performance
(Charlton et al., 2010). These results imply that improvements
in the cognitive ability of children and adolescents accompany
structural brain changes, especially in the prefrontal regions.
The characteristics of meditative movement, such as Qigong,
Tai Chi, and yoga, include a conscious practice involving
movement, a meditative state of mind, attention to breathing, and
deep relaxation (Larkey et al., 2009). Previous studies suggest that
meditative movement can change brain structure and improve
adult cognitive ability (Wei et al., 2013; Brunner et al., 2017).
Wei et al. (2013) compared and analyzed the brain structure
between a long-term Tai Chi-practicing group (14 ± 8 years)
and a control group and found that Tai Chi practice could
thicken the cortical regions of the precentral gyrus, insula sulcus
and middle frontal sulcus in the right hemisphere and the
superior temporal gyrus, medial occipitotemporal sulcus, and
lingual sulcus in the left hemisphere. Brunner et al. (2017)
has revealed that yoga training was associated with significant
improvement on both the maintenance and manipulation of
working memory in young adults. Although these findings
indicate the positive effects of meditative movement on
brain structure and cognitive function in adults, it is not
clear whether it is consistently applied to adolescents whose
brain structural maturation is actively in progress. Recently,
mindfulness meditation has been reported to enhance working
memory performance in adolescents (Quach et al., 2016). This
suggests that not only dynamic exercise (Tomporowski et al.,
2008) but also static meditation improves the working memory of
adolescents. Therefore it is speculated that meditative movement
including meditative components of slow movement compared
to regular exercise, may affect working memory and brain
activity of adolescents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Healthy adolescent volunteers without any history of
neurological or neuropsychiatric disorders, or hearing problems,
participated in the research. The participants were recruited
from the Benjamin School for Character Education, located in
the South Korea. In order to see the effects of the intervention
on working memory, the participants were randomly divided
into two groups: the experimental and control groups (Table 1).
They were all right-handed according to the Edinburgh

were excluded. Among 40 recruited participants, 36 individuals
were analyzed: one and three participants in the experimental and
control group, respectively, did not complete the study because
of lack of interest (Figure 1). The Institutional Review Board of
the University of Brain Education approved this study. Written
informed consent/assent was obtained from all children and their
parents. The current protocol is registered as a clinical trial
in the Clinical Research Information Service (CRIS registration

memory performance was estimated as the average of the
whole dual n-back level, except for the first block. In this
study, participants performed an adequate number of exercises
enough to understand dual n-back with level 2 during the preinterview, specifically till the number of errors reaches less than
5. Before the intervention, the participants performed the dual
n-back task. Three weeks later, they performed the same task
to quantify the effects of meditative movement. All participants
were prohibited from dual n-back task training during the 3week study period.

EEG Data Acquisition
The Emotiv EPOC wireless headset (14 channels1 , United States)
was used to record brain activity during the dual n-back task.
The EEG data were collected via 14 electrodes located at AF3,
F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, and AF4 based
on the American EEG Society Standard with two references (i.e.,
CMS/DRL). The sampling rate was 256 Hz, continuous EEG were
digitally band pass filtered at 0.3–45 Hz and the digital notch
filters at 60 Hz.

of three body positioning exercises with eyes closed. The first
exercise (Single Leg Stance: Dong-Nip-Bo) involved extension of
the right arm 90◦ to the front and holding the left foot to maintain
the posture. The second action reversed the first exercise along
with the direction. The last exercise (Horse Stance: Ki-Ma-Bo)
involved bending the knees similar to sitting on a chair after
spreading legs to shoulder width, and maintaining the posture.
The training program is a part of an after-school class program
in Korea for the healthy development of the mind and body
of students. Participants were asked to perform each step for
3 min. Participants in the experimental group were instructed to
perform the training program twice a day, for 9 min each time,
for 3 weeks. Simultaneously, subjects were asked to keep a clear or
calm state of mind while regulating their breathing. Participants
in the control group were seated and asked to relax during that
time. All tasks for both groups were performed in the same space
under the guidance of the instructor.

EEG Data Analysis
EEG data were segmented into epochs from −500 to 2,500 ms
time-locked to stimulus onset. The segmented EEG data in
the first block were excluded to preserve the statistical power
of working memory performance. The EEG data epochs were
submitted to extended infomax ICA (Lee et al., 1999) using runica
(Makeig et al., 1997) from the EEGLAB toolbox to eliminate
eye-blink or eye-movement artifacts. The activated components
from each subject were first assessed and categorized as brain
activity or non-brain artifact (e.g., muscle, line noise, or eyemovement activity) by visual inspection. Pre-processed EEG data
were used for fast Fourier transformation to estimate the power
of each brain rhythm including theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–13 Hz),
low-beta (13–30 Hz), and high-beta (30–40 Hz) during the
working memory task via a fieldtrip toolbox (Oostenveld et al.,
2011) with Matlab (MathWorks). The EEG power was estimated
from the whole epochs (i.e., −500 to 2500 ms). Individual
band power (i.e., theta, alpha, low-beta, and high-beta) was
averaged across epochs.

Dual n-Back Task
In order to measure working memory, we conducted a dual
n-back task that utilizes audio-visual stimuli (Jaeggi et al., 2008).
In this task, the square marker was displayed sequentially in eight
locations, and one of the eight syllables was heard simultaneously
through earphones (Figure 2). Participants responded manually
to stimuli according to n-back conditions by pressing the letter
“A” on a standard keyboard for visual targets, and the letter
“L” for auditory targets. No responses were required for nontargets. Accuracy was measured depending on the exact number
of responses. A wrong response to the non-target was penalized
by score reduction. After each block, the individual performance
was analyzed, and in the following block, the level of n was
adapted accordingly. If the accuracy was higher than 80%, the
level of n was increased by 1, and it was decreased by 1 if
the accuracy was less than 60% and the first step was lowered.
In all other cases, the level of n was maintained. A single
block comprised 20 + n trials and one session consisted of 6
blocks amounting to time of approximately 25 min. A total
of 6 blocks were conducted starting with level 2. The total
degree of difficulty was measured up to 1–4 levels. Working

Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org

Statistical Analysis
Working memory scores were measured using the average of
the level performed in the 2–6 block except the first block to
preserve statistical power. To examine the changes, working
memory scores were analyzed by repeated measures analysis
of variance (ANOVA). Multiple comparisons problem was
corrected using critical values from the t distribution, after a
Bonferroni adjustment. A regression analysis of individual band
power and working memory scores was conducted to evaluate the
changes in neural activity associated with working memory tasks,
for each of the 14 channels. A least squares regression was used to
determine the regression coefficients. All statistical analyses were
performed using Matlab (MathWorks).

the individual levels of working memory, which is applied
equally across the 14 channels. The results were used as
regressors to calculate the regression coefficient with the level
of dual n-back task under each condition: the pre-experimental,
post-experimental, pre-control, and post-control groups. We
performed regression analysis between working memory score
and band power of theta (Table 2), alpha (Table 3), lowbeta (Table 4), and high-beta (Table 5) under each condition.
For theta, alpha and low-beta band power, no channels were
found to correlate with working memory. However, at the
F3 site of high-beta band power, there was a tightly coupled
neuronal activity with working memory score in the postexperimental group. Representative EEG recordings showing
high-beta band power for each condition are given in Figure 4.
In the pre-training phase, neither group showed correlation
between high-beta power and working memory performance at
F3 (Figures 4A,B). These results indicate that in both groups,
no high-beta power affecting working memory performance was
observed before the intervention period. At the site of the F3
channels corresponding to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(DFC), a significant correlation was found between averaged
high-beta power and averaged working memory score in the postexperimental group (R2 = 0.368, p < 0.01, Figure 4C), but not
in the post-control group (Figure 4D). These results suggest that
through meditation movement training, brain activity that relates
with working memory performance was increased in the DFC
where the F3 channel is located.

interaction between retest and group (F 1,34 = 5.872, p < 0.05). In post hoc
analysis, the post-experimental group showed a significant increase in
working memory score, compared to the post-control group (Bonferroni

DISCUSSION

There were no significant differences in working memory
scores between the experimental (N = 19) and control group
(N = 17) before the intervention (p = 0.116, two sample t-test).
After the 3 week intervention period, measures of working
memory performance were analyzed via a two-way repeated
measures ANOVA with group (experimental/control) and retest
(Pre/Post) as factors. We found a main effect in the retest factor
(F 1,34 = 32.967, p < 0.00001, η2p = 0.492, Figure 3). Both groups
showed improvement in working memory performance after
the intervention. In the interaction analysis between group and
retest factors, a significant interaction was found (F 1,34 = 5.872,
p < 0.05, η2p = 0.147, Figure 3). Post hoc tests using the
Bonferroni correction revealed that there was no significant
difference between the experimental group and the control group
before the intervention in the working memory score (1.87 ± 0.33
vs. 1.69 ± 0.33, respectively). However, the averaged score of
the experimental group (2.22 ± 0.43) was substantially superior
compared to that of the control group (1.84 ± 0.40) after the
intervention (p < 0.001, with Bonferroni post hoc test). The
findings suggest that meditative movement training improves
working memory regardless of retest effects.

We designed an experiment to determine the effects of a 3-week
meditative movement training on the working memory and its
relation with neural activity of adolescent brains. In this study, we
found that the meditative movement group showed a significant
increase in dual n-back accuracy when compared with the control
group at post-intervention. This suggests that the experimental
group which underwent meditative movement training for
3 weeks had improved working memory ability compared to the
control group. The n-back task requires not only the storage and
continual updating of information in working memory, but also
interference resolution. The n-back task continuously displays
stimuli between intervals of several seconds. The participants
must determine whether the current stimulus matches what was
indicated before n trials, where n is the number of variables that
can be adjusted up or down to increase or decrease the cognitive
load, respectively. Therefore, meditative movement seems to
have a positive effect on memory capacity, judgment ability,
or stress management based on intelligent load. Interestingly,
the relationship between working memory performance and the
degree of high beta rhythm at F3 was observed by regression
analysis based on dual n-back accuracy and power of brain
rhythms derived from EEG. After training, the beta rhythm of
F3 from the prefrontal cortex showed a negative correlation with
an accurate response rate. Neural activity associated with beta
power has been reported to be involved in the efficient filtering
of irrelevant information in the processing of working memory

plays an important role in the neuropsychological performance of
patients with focal neurological lesions (Owen et al., 1990; Owen
et al., 1996), and exposure to transcranial magnetic stimulation
on the F3 location provides benefits to working memory (Fregni
et al., 2005; Preston et al., 2010). In addition, previous EEG
studies have reported that gamma oscillation and GABA levels in
the F3 channel may play an important role of working memory
performance in schizophrenia (Chen et al., 2014). These results
suggest that the left DFC, where F3 is located, is an important
brain region for working memory. Consistent with previous
reports on the function of this location, we observed the changes
of beta rhythm correlated with working memory specifically at
this location in the current study.
As participants of meditative movement keep focusing on
their body sensations during training, meditative movement
can be said to include two training components: mental and
physical component. In relation to the mental component,

(Zanto and Gazzaley, 2009). A deficit in inhibiting the processing
of irrelevant information has been suggested as a cause of a
broad spectrum of cognitive deficits (Hasher and Zacks, 1988).
Therefore, improvement in working memory performance by
meditative movement training in our study might be induced by
the enhanced filtering of irrelevant information, which is related
with beta power, but this needs further investigation.
The prefrontal cortex is thought to be the most important
brain region in terms of working memory based on extensive
studies in monkeys, which demonstrated that lesions associated
with the prefrontal cortex impaired performance on delayed
response tasks (Baddeley, 1998, 2000; Petrides, 2000). Lesions
involving the DFC decreased the performance of working
memory, but not short-term memory, in monkeys (Petrides and
Milner, 1982). These results indicate that the DFC is more likely
involved in information processing and executive function rather
than information retention. Human studies showed that the DFC

school-aged children (Dwyer et al., 2001; Tomporowski et al.,
2008). In this study, our findings of improvement in working
memory performance and its relationship with neural activity in
the prefrontal cortex by meditative movement are consistent with
previous reports mentioned above.
Meditative movement improved working memory
performance, which is related to neural activity of the prefrontal
cortex in our results. Working memory plays important roles
in cognitive function (Daneman and Tardif, 1987; Engle et al.,
1990; Kail, 2007). During adolescence, cognitive development
progresses actively, which is made up of dynamic interaction
between brain structural maturation and learning (Lebel and
Beaulieu, 2011). Improvement in the working memory of
adolescents is related with brain structural changes including
the bilateral prefrontal regions (Tamnes et al., 2013). Therefore,
changes in the neural activity of the prefrontal cortex and

meditative movement shows effects on maintenance of a relaxed
and attentive mind (Tei et al., 2006, 2009). Compared to
a normal healthy condition, under chronic stress conditions,
the neuronal activity of the prefrontal cortex is significantly
diminished (Arnsten, 2009). Stress reduces the neuronal activity
related with working memory in the prefrontal cortex (Qin
et al., 2009; Mika et al., 2012). Meditative movement induces
stress-alleviating effects (Posadzki et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2014)
and activates the prefrontal cortex (Cheng et al., 2010). Not
only the mental component, but also the physical component
of meditative movement may affect working memory. Physical
exercise was shown to improve working memory (Baddeley,
1992; Aben et al., 2012), which is critical for a wide range of
cognitive functions (Daneman and Tardif, 1987; Engle et al., 1990;
Kail, 2007). The exercise-cognition relationship was established
by the increase in academic performance following exercise in

Meditative Movement and Working Memory

conditions without training showed no significant correlation between n-back grade and beta power. (C) The beta power of F3 was negatively correlated with

more attention should have been paid to increase statistical
power by strategies, which is included to the limitations of the
current study. Recently, a meta-analysis study has presented
results implying sex-specific recommendations on how the
effects of exercise on cognition in healthy individuals can be
optimized by potential moderators such as exercise intensity,
type, and session duration (Ludyga et al., 2020). In the current
study, the percentage of female participants is 45%, which
may dilute the overall effect of the exercise intervention due
to the mixed use of gender, which can be another limitation
of the study. For further researches, experimental design
should be performed under consideration of gender difference.
Moreover, Ludyga et al. (2020) revealed that the effect size
increased with expending the session duration, lasting the
exercise intervention over 20 weeks, and increasing the sample
size, which are included to the limitations of the current
study. In addition, we controlled several confounding factors
such as age, handedness, and vision, which might affect brain
activities. However, other confounding factors including factors
of affective and motor aspects were not strictly controlled,
which is a limitation of the study. The current results suggest
the connectivity between meditative movement and cognitive
function and are meaningful in following three aspects.
First, this study contributes to accumulation of knowledge
about the effects of meditative movement during adolescence,
when there has been insufficient data of mind–body training
for adolescence. Second, it provides scientific evidence for
the application of meditation training to actual education.
Especially, our results suggest that not only dynamic exercise
(Tomporowski et al., 2008) as previously known, but also
meditation training accompanied by slow movements with
high concentration can be a good tool for improvement of

improvement in working memory by meditative movement
suggests that it can be utilized as a learning tool which induces
positive interaction for brain maturation during adolescence.
According to the recent meta regression analysis, coordinative
exercise was most effective for improving cognitive function
(Ludyga et al., 2020). In view of cognition, the exercise modes
are divided into physical training whose character is repetitive
and automatic, and motor training in which coordinative
exercise is included. While physical training indirectly affects
cognition through improvements in cardiovascular strength
by training intensity, motor training directly affects cognition
through neuromuscular activation (Netz, 2019). This implies
underlying mechanisms how meditative movement, which
can be categorized into motor training, improved working
memory performance in the current study. Our observations
suggest that not only traditional physical training but also
meditative movement which demands one’s focus although
the motion speed is relatively slow can be used as an
effective tool for improving cognition. Especially, this is
practically meaningful because the meditative movement can
be used to improve cognition of people under various
physical condition.
In this study, we observed that the meditative movement
significantly increased working memory score and affected
the neuronal activity associated with working memory
in adolescents. In regression analysis, the coefficient of
determination (R2 = 0.368) between EEG F3 channels and
working memory performance showed a rather weak correlation.
For social science data, the effect size of 0.25 is suggested to
interpret as moderate effect (Ferguson, 2009). According to the
criteria, our effect size of 0.368 corresponds to the moderate
effect. In order to guarantee the repeatability of the findings,

working memory, which is important for cognitive function
(Daneman and Tardif, 1987; Engle et al., 1990; Kail, 2007),
in adolescents. This presents a broad application possibility
for cognitive development tools to adolescent students with
various physical conditions. Third, it presents an evidence-based
direction for further study.
Future studies include the investigation of the mechanisms
which may cause the changes observed here. Meditative
movement may improve cognitive abilities through mechanisms
involving stress management or physical fitness. To understand
this, it is necessary to study the relationship between stress
responsiveness, physical changes, and cognitive ability after
meditative movement training. In addition, changes in brain
activation during meditative movement are also expected to
provide very important clues. One further interesting question
is what common brain activity patterns and networks are
shown during meditation movement and working memory,
and how this affects cognitive performance. Another interesting
question in the next study is whether there is a link between
brain activation, stress, and physical changes during meditative
movement training, and whether there is a change in brain
area activity associated with the maturation of working memory.
The cognitive improvement of adolescents who performed
meditative movement training in the current study warrants
its application potential to education and further researches on
meditative movement training, as a mean to enhance adolescent
brain development.
