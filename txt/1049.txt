Abstract: The present case study looked into the feasibility of using brain–computer interface (BCI)
technology combined with computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) in a wireless network. We
had two objectives; first, to test the wireless BCI-based configuration and the practical use of this idea
we assessed workload perception in participants located several kilometers apart taking part in the
same drawing task. Second, we studied the cortical activation patterns of participants performing
the drawing task with and without the BCI technology. Results showed higher mental workload
perception and broader cortical activation (frontal-temporal-occipital) under BCI experimental
conditions. This idea shows a possible application of BCI research in the social field, where two or
more users could engage in a computer networking task using BCI technology over the internet. New
research avenues for CSCW are discussed and possibilities for future research are given.

1. Introduction
Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) enable users to send commands to a computer using brain
activity alone. This technology forms part of a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field of research
encompassing neuroscience, computer science, engineering, and, more recently, psychology. BCI
devices can be utilized in several areas of research, including physical rehabilitation, neurological
disorders, human–machine interactions, and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW). BCIs
enable two individuals to connect to one another through an Internet network to perform simple
computer-based cooperative tasks. While these tasks may help in creating a new mental state or shared
consciousness, they can have high perceived workload demands.
Context-aware CSCW interactions provide relevant information or services to the user while they
are carrying out the task. Sohlenkamp [1] suggested that awareness in the context of CSCW enables
users to coordinate and structure their work. This can be used to facilitate collaborative work [2].
In the context of CSCW systems, a group can be seen as a number of individuals who interact directly
or through shared devices who perceive themselves as a group [3]. Group awareness can be broadly
defined as the consciousness and knowledge of various aspects of the group and its members.
Research on the interaction between computers and internal states of the human body spans several
disciplines, including cognitive psychology, neuroscience, affective and physiological computing,
and human–computer interaction (HCI). However, most of the BCI system and physiology-based
interaction studies published to date have used a single user, with the possibility of their use in
collaborative scenarios or CSCW remaining unexplored. This study aimed to develop a multi-user

Mental workload is an important consideration when designing tasks or procedures that
require user attention. In this study, mental workload was recorded to investigate the feasibility of
BCIs for assistive technology and alternative control in CSCW or multi-mind connected network

to reduce mental effort when performing computer tasks [18] which tend to require high visual and
cognitive demands, leading to an increase in mental workload [19]. In this study, participants several
kilometers apart were able to create a simple painting using EEG patterns transmitted via connected
BCI systems. This novel step into mental networks connected through these devices opens a new
avenue for CSCW. We found that drawing with a BCI required greater mental workload and effort
in comparison to a conventional physical, approach. Levels of frustration were also substantially
increased when drawing under BCI conditions. It is clear from these results that the technology needs
to be improved and a better understanding of the human brain and its cognitive processing is required.
The final drawings obtained from the participants did not differ greatly in comparison to when
participants were not using the BCI system; although it required greater effort, they were able to achieve
similar results. Mental workload could be a helpful measure when designing these technological
improvements, and the NASA-TLX was a sensitive measure of this. This increased effort was also
evidenced by greater activation in brain regions responsible for visual perception (occipital regions)
and executive functioning (frontal cortices). Previous studies have suggested a role of the P300 in
ERP (event-related potential) BCI applications, with this being altered in both healthy subjects and
patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [15,20,21] during BCI tasks, including those requiring
drawing [22–25]. We are not aware of any other published study investigating the neural activity
associated with CSCW with BCI in drawing or other tasks. In our task we observed greater occipital
involvement during BCI than during a normal drawing task. It has previously been suggested that
actions themselves form part of the perceptual process [26]; this is in accordance with the greater
activation of regions associated with visual processing during the BCI drawing task. However, BCI
systems have some limitations, especially for this type of psychosocial experiment. Among BCI
limitations we can mention the large amount of training data required from users and the relatively
long times required to calibrate classifiers. Some methods have been suggested to help with these
limitations, including SBLaplace algorithms to obtain better overall classification performance for
ERP-based BCIs (especially for small sample size scenarios), improving the practicability of BCI
systems [27]. Additionally, a potential limitation of motor-imagery-based BCIs is the requirement of
relatively long times to record sufficient EEG data for robust classifier training [28]. Flexible group
sparse discriminative analysis algorithms based on Moreau-Yosida regularization have been proposed
for alleviating the common undersampling problem present with small training samples in ERP,
especially P-300 BCI-based studies [29].
There were several limitations in particular to our study. Only a small number of participants
were used, although it is difficult to use a large number of participants in these experiments. Future
research may connect multiple individuals with BCIs. Secondly, the Emotiv Epoc+ BCI system has
only 14 channels and is not intended to record or analyze EEG or ERP activity. However, this pilot
study was conducted with the view that similar studies conducted in the future may utilize more
accurate and standardized setups as technology evolves. Another problem to be solved is possible
network delay/bandwidth issues that may occur, affecting the interactions.
Drawing with BCI systems may improve the quality of life for patients with severe motor
disabilities. This experiment also demonstrates a novel form of CSCW where several participants
can participate in a common process or task and produce a result that is the sum of their different
perceptions, intentions, and consciousness. In the future, computer processes and associated events
may occur as a result of single minds converging to allow this to happen.
This pilot study demonstrates the possible use of BCI devices for CSCW, but also raises some
limitations of their use. The high mental workload demands reported by participants demonstrate
the need for the further development of the ergonomics, usability, and software integration of this
technology. The NASA-TLX was able to detect the increased workload required for the BCI drawing
task. EEG recordings also showed increased general and occipital activation during the BCI during the
task. Further research is required using BCIs and multiple participants, networks, and paradigms.

Further research should be done in other domains, such as computer programing, mathematics,
problem solving, or language.
5. Conclusions
This case study tested the feasibility of a BCI setup for CSCW task over the Internet. Several
limitations were detected but in general the application was possible. NASA-TLX detected subjective
increased perceived workload demand in BCI condition compared to no BCI task. This idea opens new
paths for application of BCI in the social field, where two or more users could engage in networking
tasks using Internet based applications. The possibilities are especially interesting for research with
patients with severe motor problems.
