ABSTRACT
In this study, we investigated the impacts of in-situ nature and urban exposure
on human brain activities and their dynamics. We randomly assigned 32 healthy
right-handed college students (mean age = 20.6 years, SD = 1.6; 16 males) to a
20 min in-situ sitting exposure in either a nature (n = 16) or urban environment
(n = 16) and measured their Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Analyses
revealed that a brief in-situ restorative nature experience may induce more efficient
and stronger brain connectivity with enhanced small-world properties compared
with a stressful urban experience. The enhanced small-world properties were found
to be correlated with “coherent” experience measured by Perceived Restorativeness
Scale (PRS). Exposure to nature also induces stronger long-term correlated activity
across different brain regions with a right lateralization. These findings may advance
our understanding of the functional activities during in-situ environmental
exposures and imply that a nature or nature-like environment may potentially
benefit cognitive processes and mental well-being.

INTRODUCTION
Evidence has suggested that, compared to urban exposure, nature exposure may have a
restorative effect on human health and well-being (Bowler et al., 2010; Calogiuri &
Chroni, 2014; Groenewegen et al., 2006; Velarde, Fry & Tveit, 2007), especially in regulating
emotion (Capaldi, Dopko & Zelenski, 2014) and mitigating excessive arousal (Jiang,
Chang & Sullivan, 2014; Li & Sullivan, 2016; Ulrich, 1984; Ulrich, 1981; Ulrich et al., 1991).
More recent studies have demonstrated improvements in working memory and attention
shortly after a short-term nature experience (Berman, Jonides & Kaplan, 2008; Lee
et al., 2015; Taylor & Kuo, 2009). In one example, a brief nature walk significantly reduced
anxiety-related neural activity in the subgenual prefrontal cortex (Bratman et al., 2015b),
which enhanced cognitive performance (by increasing working memory performance)

and affective regulation (by reducing negative affect and rumination while increasing
positive affect). This phenomenon suggests that the natural environment may be able to
influence the human cognitive state, which is less understood than emotion regulation
and arousal mitigation are (Bowler et al., 2010).
Previous studies have suggested that the 1/f characteristics in the log-log power
spectrum may be potential key factors in shaping cognitive functions during natural
adaptation and evolution. The 1/f statistic describes the power composition from low to
high frequencies. It is a unique statistical feature of natural signals that is widely observed
in natural environments but rare in urban environments. Studies have revealed that
mammalian brains can perform more efficiently in response to naturalistic signals than
artificial ones (Simoncelli & Olshausen, 2001). A nature-like signal should contain a highorder statistic of a 1/fb-like power spectrum. In-vivo evidence has demonstrated that
mammalian sensory systems (Gal & Marom, 2013; Yu, Romero & Lee, 2005) can process
natural signals more efficiently than artificial signals. This characteristic of cognitive
functioning may impact the efficiency of neural networks (He, 2011) and may eventually
define global cognitive performance.
The evidence above suggests a new hypothesis: signal statistics may be one critical factor
that drives the human brain to perform more efficiently in nature settings than in urban
settings. Hence, in this paper, we examine the following questions: Do nature and constructed
artifacts differ significantly in their statistics of visual stimuli? Do human brains respond
differently to these different statistics? What are the significant differences in the brain when
responding to the two types of environmental signals? Although visual signals are probably
among the most important stimuli in the two types of environments, we believe that visual
signals only partially capture the differences between the environments. To fully capture the
holistic environmental experience, multisensory immersion is crucial. Therefore, we adopted
in-situ exposure herein instead of pictorial representation.
Our new hypothesis is supported by a recent analysis of auditory perception (Fintzi &
Mahon, 2014). A visual study of urban and nature scenes found that stress and cognitive
load are more sensitive to low spatial frequencies of the scenes, whereas affective responses
are more sensitive to mid-to-high spatial frequencies (Valtchanov & Ellard, 2015),
which suggests that brain functions may be sensitive to frequencies. Another study found
that, compared to random noise, music sound with a 1/f property can induce enhanced
brain connectivity with efficient information flow across brain regions featuring a
small-world complex network property (Wu et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2012). Small-world
networks are hierarchical structures with more efficient and well-connected hubs, which
are widely found in biological, ecological, social, world-wide web, molecular and neuronal
networks (Watts & Strogatz, 1998). Because of these hubs, the small-world network usually
entails a large clustering coefficient and short path length, which enables a more efficient
flow of information than that found in randomly ordered nonhierarchical networks.
To answer the questions above, we collected data both from brain neural activities
and from subjective perceived experience using a portable electroencephalogram (EEG)
device and psychological scales, respectively. We then examined the EEG functional
connectivity during in-situ nature and urban experiences, including functional

correlation, small-world network statistics, 1/f statistics and their lateralization, and
compared EEG statistics with a subjective experience measured by psychological scales.

METHODS
Subjects
In this study, we recruited 32 healthy, right-handed participants (mean age = 20.6,
SD = 1.6, 16 males) from among Chinese college students. A between-subjects design was
used in this study, in which participants were randomly assigned to a nature environment
(n = 16, 6 males) or an urban environment (n = 16, 10 males). This study was approved
and supervised by the Ethics Committee of Tongji University (no. 2015yxy103).
No significant levels of neuroticism were detected among the participants as indicated
by the scores (Table 1) on the neuroticism subscale of the NEO Personality Inventory
(Costa & McCrae, 1992). All participants reported a small amount of daily stress and had
relatively stress-reducing living environments. The subjects were generally well-rested
with a broad range of work and entertainment schedules; however, all subjects
participated in moderate exercise and were exposed to nature on a daily basis.

Environments
Because human cognition of nature and the urban environment may be sensitive to the
frequencies of visual stimuli (Valtchanov & Ellard, 2015), we intentionally controlled
the proportion of frequencies and used the b values in the 1/f statistics of visual stimuli as
the criteria for site selection. Research has shown that the b values of nature images are
typically close to 2 (Szendro, Vincze & Szasz, 2001; West & Shlesinger, 1990) due to an
appropriate distribution between low-frequency contours (e.g., shapes of trees or
mountains) and high-frequency details (e.g., fractal edges, random texture and lines).
This finding implies a moderate long-term correlation level across image components of
all frequency ranges. With increasingly uniform materials (e.g., concrete) and limited
high-frequency detail, urban scenes may be more likely to reveal a larger b, but we were
less confident about this hypothesis before verification.
To find a typical nature and urban environment, we first examined a large number of
photographs. Because of limited confidence in the b estimation for urban scenes, we
intentionally investigated a larger sample of photographs of urban scenes (n = 135) than
nature scenes (n = 80). All of the photos had been captured and reviewed by professional
landscape architects and architects. Both nature and urban photos revealed a normal
distribution of b (Figs. 1C and 1D), with means of 2.30 (SD = 0.22) and 2.61 (SD = 0.18),
respectively (Fig. 1). These results were consistent with those from a previous study (Braun
et al., 2013) that documented an average b of 2.24 (SD = 0.19) for nature scenes and 2.53
(SD = 0.24) for buildings, which were obtained from sample sizes of 200 photos each.
Therefore, we intentionally selected two typical sites (Fig. 2) with representative b slopes:
a wooded campus garden (b = 2.24) for the nature scene and a traffic island under an
elevated highway (b = 2.62) for the urban scene. From where the participants were seated,
the nature scene consisted of 89% visible greenery and water and only 4% visible buildings
and/or paved areas; the urban scene consisted of only 8% visible greenery and 56% visible

buildings and/or paved areas. Based on a focus group interview after a site visit, the nature
environment is highly restorative whereas the urban environment is clearly not.
In-situ environmental stimuli were adopted instead of pictorial representations to
capture the multisensory experiences of the nature and urban environments. We reported
possible factors that may have influenced the viewers’ on-site experiences, and some of the
factors were controlled (Table 2; Figs. 2C–2F). The uncontrolled factors constituted
important features of the nature and urban experience.

Measures
EEG data collection, pre-processing and power analysis
An Emotiv wireless headset (Dekihara & Iwaki, 2014) and its accompanying software were
used to measure EEGs. The headset consists of 14 sensors positioned on the scalp of
the study subject according to the international 10–20 system: antero-frontal (AF3, AF4, F3,
F4, F7, F8), frontocentral (FC5, FC6), occipital (O1, O2), parietal (P7, P8) and temporal
sites (T7, T8). Brain waves were measured in terms of amplitude (10–100 microvolts)
and frequency (1–70 Hz). EEG data were analyzed via Matlab and EEGlab. Data were first

and brain connectivity.

EEG functional connectivity
To evaluate EEG functional connectivity, we first calculated the EEG correlations and then
calculated the small-world network statistics.
Correlations
Correlations between signals or signal frequency components at different electrodes were
calculated using the following equation:
rðxÞ ¼ CAB ðxÞ=ðCAA CBB Þ

(1)

where the cross-covariance between signals A and B was noted as CAB and the
auto-covariances of signals A and B were noted as CAA and CBB, respectively (Guevara &
Corsi-Cabrera, 1996).
Small-world network statistics
Small-world networks are hierarchical structures with more efficient and well-connected
hubs, which are widely found in biological, ecological, social, world-wide web, molecular
and neuronal networks (Watts & Strogatz, 1998; Wu et al., 2013). A small-world network
is defined by two measures: the clustering coefficient (Cmean) to describe functional
segregation and the average shortest path length (Lmean) to describe functional integration
(Rubinov & Sporns, 2010). A small-world network is usually more efficient (Honey
et al., 2009) because it is highly segregated (larger Cmean) and highly integrated (shorter
Lmean). The former allows divisions for tasks to be specialized while the later allows
coordination to support collaboration between divisions.
Based on correlations, we measured small-world network propriety using Lmean, which
is the average shortest path length, and Cmean, which is the clustering coefficient. The
clustering coefficient of an electrode vi was calculated as follows:

0
k2
(2)
Cvi ¼
2n
k>2
k ðk1Þ

where k denotes the number of electrodes of an EEG correlation with the electrode vi higher
than a given threshold, and n denotes the number of paths with a correlation higher than
the threshold between the connected k electrodes (where n equals Ck2 in a saturated
scenario). The average clustering coefficient for a participant was then calculated as follows:
14
1 X
Cv
(3)
Cmean ¼
14 i¼1 i
The shortest path length was calculated from the shortest of all total paths from vi to vj
for a pair of electrodes vi and vj using the Floyd algorithm (Floyd, 1962). The Floyd
algorithm defines a n  n weight matrix as

where rij denotes the maximum from the correlation function between electrodes vi and vj
with phase difference considered in the calculation, while dij denotes the connectivity
distance instead of the physical Euclidean distance. The weight matrix D is calculated as
follows:

electrodes vi and vj.

(6)

The path length between two immediate neighbors was coded as 0 (to itself), 1 (beyond
threshold) or 13 (below threshold). By definition, the weight D is usually calculated using
the positive infinity of a comparable disconnected network. However, this calculation
may be flawed because the average of the shortest path length is oversensitive to the
isolated points. Only one or two isolated points will drive the average to positive infinity
when the whole network is far from being truly disconnected. To correct this
oversensitivity, we used a large number instead of positive infinity. We interpreted the
disconnected electrodes vi and vj as a situation when vi must travel through all other
electrodes to reach vj, which is mathematically 13 (or the number of electrodes (14) minus
one). For each participant,

Random network statistics
It is a standard procedure in small-world network analysis to report random referencing
networks for control purposes. We used the following methods to construct such random
networks and to calculate corresponding Lmean and Cmean:

Am,th,, that is, when aij ¼ 1ði < j Þ as na. The number of such non-diagonal cells in
Am,th should be 2  na because of symmetry. Because Rm, and hence Am,th, was
diagonally symmetric, only the cell value of the upper half matrix needed to be
assigned.
4. We counted the total number of isolated points in Am,th as niso. If all cells in the ith row

Power spectrum density 1/f statistics
The power spectral density P(f) describes how the power of a signal x(t) or a time series is
distributed with frequency. It is usually calculated by the following Fourier transform
equations. First, the Fourier transform of a time domain signal x(t) in frequency domain
x(f) is calculated as
Z 1
xðf Þ ¼
xðtÞe 2ift dt
(8)
1

where f is the frequency in Hz, i.e., cycles per second. The integrand jx(f)j2 can be
interpreted as an energy density function describing the energy per frequency unit
contained in the signal at the frequency f. The power spectrum density of a signal x(t) is
thus defined as
jxðf Þj2
T>1
T

Pðf Þ ¼ lim

(9)

where T is the infinite time.
The 1/f statistic or 1/fb, which is a log-log linear correlation between power spectrum
and frequency, is commonly found in natural signals. 1/f statistics of EEG networks
describe the nested frequency characteristic of brain networks. Previous evidence has
indicated that a larger b is found in human brain networks during task-free rest, while b

9/25

decreases during tasks (He et al., 2010), and more difficult tasks have been found to trigger
larger decreases in b (Ward, 2002).
The 1/f statistics were calculated as the regression slope b (absolute value) of the log
power over the log frequency in a 1/fb power spectrum. The b values were first calculated
at each electrode for each individual participant and then linearly combined as electrode
and individual global means. Lateralization was calculated as log(R)-log(L) where R and L
represent the right and left symmetrical pairs (i.e., AF4/AF3, F8/F7, F4/F3, FC6/FC5,
T8/T7, O2/O1), respectively.
Subjective affect, experience and attention
We used a 40-item Profile of Mood States (POMS) scale (Grove & Prapavessis, 1992) to
measure the affective states before and after environmental exposure. Participants
completed a POMS scale upon arrival at either experimental site and completed
another scale after a 20-min exposure at the respective site. By linearly combining the
40 items, the scale reveals eight affective measures (tension, anger, fatigue, depression,
vigor, esteem, confusion, and total mood disturbance (TMD)). We calculated the
changes of the eight measures, which revealed the impact of environmental exposure
on subjective affect, and compared the differences in changes between nature and
urban groups.
We used a revised Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS) to measure participants’
perception about their environmental experience. Kaplan (1995) summarized the four key
qualities of environmental visual stimuli that induced a restorative experience: (1) the
environment should offer a “being away” feeling, i.e., a mental refuge from everyday
chores and routines; (2) the environment should induce mild and positive emotional
arousal that he termed “(soft) fascination”; (3) the environment should offer “coherent”
information for “extent,” which should be comprehensible and should allow fruitful
explorations, independent of complexity; (4) the environment should promote
“compatibility,” i.e., a potential to afford certain desirable activities. Based on Kaplan’s
theory, Hartig et al. (1997) developed the PRS to measure the restorative qualities of
nature visual exposure. We collected feedback from a focus group of participants with
comparable backgrounds and revised the scale to better capture the experience reported
by the focus group (Table 2).
We used the Necker Cube Pattern Control Test to measure participants’ attention
change (Orbach, Ehrlich & Heath, 1963) before and after environmental exposures.
A higher attention level is indicated by a smaller number of cube pattern changes. We used
the change before and after exposure Npost  Npre to measure the impact of environmental
exposure on one’s attention.
Statistical test
We conducted both a participant-wise comparison using independent t-tests and an
electrode-wise comparison using t-tests that were paired by electrodes. If the differences
were significant in both cases, only the participant-wise results were reported. Two-way
ANOVA was used when two-factor comparisons were made.

Procedure and data validity control

1

EEGs of the entire 20-min exposure were
recorded for the latter 16 participants
(8 nature) while only the latter half
(10 min) of the exposure was measured
for the first 16 participants (8 nature).
Paired t-tests revealed no significant differences between the first half (10 min)
and the latter half (10 min) of exposure
for the 16 participants whose EEGs were
recorded for the entire 20 min in terms of
EEG correlation and b exponent, except
for two participants in the urban environment groups. Therefore, the full
recording length from both groups
(10 min for the first half and 20 min for
the latter half) was used for analyses.

The experiment was performed via a structured procedure (Fig. 3). The 32 participants
were first randomly assigned to either a nature exposure group (n = 16) or an urban
exposure group (n = 16). After first signing a written consent form containing an
explanation of the experimental procedure and risks, participants completed a two-page
pre-test questionnaire followed by the Necker Cube Pattern Control Test. Portable EEG
electrodes were positioned onto the scalps of participants, who were then asked to sit
facing a wall to temporarily exclude visual information. Participants were instructed to
alternate between either opening or closing their eyes in four one-minute cycles. After this
pre-experimental phase, participants were told to turn and face the environment for
20 min.1 Participants were asked to sit facing either an urban environment (i.e., a traffic
island under an elevated highway) or a natural environment (i.e., a heavily wooded
campus garden). After viewing the environment, participants completed a posttest
questionnaire, a short interview and Necker cube test again. To prevent their minds
from wandering or becoming drowsy, participants were told to count from 1 to 1,000
soundlessly at a speed that was slow enough not to interrupt the environmental
experience.
We specifically adopted eye-opened and eye-closed pretests in the beginning of the
experiment to verify the reliability/stability of electrode recording across the 20 min of the
environmental exposure. We examined the power distribution and 1/f statistics of two

electrodes at the primary visual cortex (O1 and O2) during the two pretests. The results
revealed a clear 1/f statistic in both the nature and urban environments. At both sites,
there was also a clear bump at the top of the 1/f slope near logf = 1 (the location of the
alpha range) during the eye-closed session, while the bump dropped towards the slope
during the eye-open session (Figs. 1B and 1C). This bump-dropping effect during the eyeopen session is called alpha-blocking (Könönen & Partanen, 1993). The successful capture
of 1/f statistics (arrhythmic firing) and alpha-blocking (rhythmic oscillation) supports the
validity of the data.

RESULTS
EEG functional connectivity
Signal correlation
We computed the functional connectivity by calculating both the time domain EEG
correlation (Figs. 4A and 4B) across electrodes and the frequency domain correlation
(Figs. 4C and 4D). The EEG component correlation across recording sites for the theta
frequency band is shown (the other delta, alpha and beta bands have similar results
and were not shown here). The direct EEG amplitude correlation across recording sites
demonstrated a higher correlation on the right side of the brain than on the left side,
suggesting more synchronized EEG signals on the right side. Additionally, the
correlation on the right side of the brain is higher for natural exposure than in the
urban environment. The EEG measure of frequency-dependent functional connectivity
reveals the coherent property of information transfer at different frequency ranges
across recording regions (Fries, 2005; Varela et al., 2001). A participant-wise two-way
ANOVA was performed on the mean EEG frequency correlation of 14 electrodes and at
two conditions (nature and urban environment exposures). We observed a
significantly higher correlation (in frequency domain, see Figs. 4C and 4D) of overall
electrodes during nature exposure compared to that during urban environment
exposure (the ratio of between-group difference over within-group difference was
F(1,420) = 14.68, p < 0.001), while no significant differences were found in the wallfacing eye-open baselines (p = 0.314). Stronger functional connectivity networks were
found in the right hemisphere during the nature exposure than the urban exposure.
An electrode-wise two-way ANOVA was then performed on the EEG power
correlations in the four conventional frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha and beta)
and under two conditions (nature and urban environment exposures), which was
followed by a t-test paired by electrodes. We observed a significantly higher overall
power correlation during nature exposure compared to that during urban
environment exposure (F(1,134) = 120.14, p < 0.001) with a higher power correlation
observed during nature exposure observed in delta (T(13) = 10.76, paired by
electrodes, p < 0.001), theta (T(13) = 6.73, paired by electrodes, p < 0.001), alpha
(T(13) = 6.25, paired by electrodes, p < 0.001) and beta (T(13) = 5.06, paired by
electrodes, p < 0.001) frequencies.

(Fig. S1). The functional connectivity networks revealed stronger networks in the right hemisphere
during the nature exposure (E) than during the urban exposure (F).

Small-world network
We analyzed the small-world network statistics of the EEG activity by calculating
the average shortest path length (Lmean) and network clustering coefficient
(Cmean). We reported Lmean and Cmean at different thresholds ranging from
0.05–0.95 (Fig. 5).
The average shortest path lengths (Lmean) are smaller during the nature experience than
during the urban experience, but no significant difference was found except at both
ends of the threshold spectrum. Both EEG networks had approximately the same value of
Lmean at their random references. The clustering coefficients (Cmean) were significantly

threshold values, except 0.05, 0.40, 0.55, 0.70–0.80). At both environmental conditions,
the EEG networks had a higher Cmean than did the random references (p < 0.05 for most
threshold values from 0.20–0.85).
However, the difference between the nature and urban environments was that the
average shortest path length (Lmean) was more significant when analyzed in the frequency
domain. The results for the theta band, for example (Fig. 6), revealed that the EEG
functional connection during the nature exposure had a smaller average shortest
path length (p < 0.05 from a threshold of 0.45–0.80) and a larger clustering coefficient
(p < 0.05, from a threshold of 0.40–0.70). The results at the other frequency bands were
reported in the supplementary figures (Figs. S2–S4).

versus frequency in a log-log space. Interestingly, the EEG power spectrum also
displays 1/f properties similar to those observed for the natural signals. The fitting slope,
i.e., the b value, for each recording site is approximately 1.5, and the average value for all
recording sites in the natural scene is 1.62 ± 0.027, which is significantly higher than that
in the urban environment (1.54 ± 0.033, T(13) = 2.68, p = 0.019, t-test paired by electrode,

To further investigate the spatial variation of 1/f statistics, six brain regions were
studied: the left (AF3, F7 and F3) and right antero-frontal (AF4, F8 and F4); left (FC5 and
T7) and right temporal/frontocentral (FC6 and T8); and left (P7 and O1) and right
parietal/occipital (P8 and O2). A trend towards larger b slopes in these brain regions
was observed during the nature experience (Fig. 7B). Additionally, for both conditions,
b values were higher on the right brain side than the left side, indicating a clear
lateralization effect. The lateralization was quantified as  ¼ right  left . Fig. 7C shows

except P8/P7 and O2/O1 regions.

Subjective measures and their correlation with
functional connectivity
Perceived restorative experience and small-world
network property
Participants reported a more restorative experience after a nature exposure than that
after an urban exposure. After a nature exposure, participants reported higher fascination
(T(28.93) = 3.23, p = 0.003), higher coherence (T(30) = 3.00, p = 0.005), increased
perception of being away (T(30) = 4.31, p < 0.001) and higher compatibility
(T(30) = 6.68, p < 0.001). Our observations herein are consistent with previous
experimental reports (Berto, 2007; Hartig et al., 1997; Herzog, Maguire & Nebel, 2003).
To investigate the impact of EEGs on perceived experience, we then compared the EEG
correlations during exposure with the four PRS factors and the changes of the eight POMS
scores using Pearson’s correlation. Moderate correlations were observed between the
coherence score from the self-reported PRS factors and the average EEG correlations in
the theta (correlation coefficient, i.e., cc = 0.46, p = 0.008), alpha (cc = 0.37, p = 0.040),
beta (cc = 0.35, p = 0.049) and gamma (cc = 0.36, p = 0.045) bands.
We then regressed the PRS coherence scores on the small-world network statistics in
the lower bands (delta, theta, and alpha, Fig. 8). The participant-wise small-world
network statistics were calculated by averaging the values at mid-range thresholds from
0.65 to 0.85. Regression revealed a significant correlation between the PRS
coherence scores and the individual shortest path length mean (Lmean) in theta
(R2 = 0.291, p = 0.001) and alpha bands (R2 = 0.292, p = 0.001). There was also a
significant correlation between the PRS coherence scores and the individual clustering
coefficient mean (Cmean) in the theta (R2 = 0.201, p = 0.010) and delta bands
(R2 = 0.148, p = 0.030).

Figure 8 Scatterplots of the PRS coherence scores of 32 participants on their small-world network
statistics. We calculated the individual shortest path length mean (L mean, L) and the individual clustering
coefficient mean (Cmean, CC) of the 32 participants by averaging the values at mid-range threshold (from
0.65 to 0.85) at different frequency bands and used the frequency bands as a predictor of PRS coherence in a
simple linear regression. The x axis in (A), (C) and (E) denotes the participant’s shortest path length mean
(L) averaged by the 14 electrodes, while the x axis in (B), (D) and (F) denotes the clustering coefficient mean
(CC) averaged by the 14 electrodes. The y axis in all six figures denotes PRS coherence.

Subjective affect and 1/f statistics
After nature exposure, participants reported less fatigue and reported more positive
emotions than did those exposed to the urban environment. More specifically, after
nature exposure, participants reported less increased fatigue (T(30) = 2.45, p = 0.020),
more sustained vigor (T(30) = 2.09, p = 0.045), more sustained esteem (T(30) = 2.31,
p = 0.028) and less increased TMD (T(30) = 2.88, p = 0.007).
We compared individual global b with the POMS affective measures and the Necker
change ratio using the Pearson correlation. Significant correlations were found between
individual global b and their changes in fatigue (cc = -0.410, p = 0.020) and vigor
(cc = 0.442, p = 0.011).
Attention
We did not observe any significant differences between the nature and urban groups in
attention changes that were measured by the Necker cube change (p = 0.343), although
Chen et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.2210

such differences have been reported elsewhere (Tennessen & Cimprich, 1995). No
correlations were found between the Necker cube changes and functional connectivity,
either in the 1/f statistic or the small-world network property.

DISCUSSION
Growing experimental and theoretical evidence supports the notion that human and
animal visual systems are adapted to represent natural scenes efficiently (Simoncelli &
Olshausen, 2001). Because brain vision systems have evolved in the natural world, it has
been strongly suggested (Olshausen & Field, 1996; Simoncelli & Olshausen, 2001) that early
visual pathways were adapted to de-correlate the correlational structure of the input
signals efficiently and then pool all the encoded information together in the higher level
cortex to formulate internal pictures of the outward natural world. Hence, brain sensory
systems may function more efficiently in response to a natural scene and consume less
energy in the visual processing of natural signals (Laughlin, 2001; Olshausen & Field, 1997;
Simoncelli & Olshausen, 2001). As stated in our previous study of non-human primates
(Yu, Romero & Lee, 2005), the visual function of cortical neurons may be designed to tune
to 1/f characteristics for efficient coding, which induces a preference in the visual system
for natural signals in the natural environment. Additionally, a recent study (Torralba &
Oliva, 2003) reported that cardinal (horizontal and vertical) orientations are more
prevalent in sample image statistics of man-made artifacts (e.g., urban buildings, streets,
highway infrastructures) than in images of natural scenes. Further, there are more lowfrequency components and fewer high-frequency components in built artificial views,
which result in a larger slope ( 2.5) in the power spectra of urban images (Braun et al.,
2013; Torralba & Oliva, 2003).
This raises a nontrivial issue. That is, after prolonged exposure to urban artifacts with
signal statistics that are distinct from those in nature, could human neural responses
differ in terms of statistical properties and therefore become overstressed and
uncomfortable (Penacchio & Wilkins, 2015)? In fact, recent studies have documented
a significant drop in both self-reported rumination and neural activity in the
subgenual prefrontal cortex of healthy participants after a 90 min walk in a natural
environment, but no such effect was observed following a walk in an urban environment
(Bratman et al., 2015b).

Small-world network property and perceived environment coherence
We found enhanced small-world network properties in the brain functional connection
during exposure to nature. The functional network in nature was found to be of both a
higher functional segregation (larger clustering coefficient, i.e., Cmean) and a higher
functional integration (smaller average shortest path length, i.e., Lmean) than that of urban
exposure. This finding implies that human brains are functionally connected during
nature exposure in a way that enables divisions for specialized information processing and
coordination between these divisions. This enhanced small-world property has also been
observed in the context of music perception (Wu et al., 2012) when compared to
noise listening.
Chen et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.2210

18/25

The small-world characteristics of the functional network during nature experiences
were most prominent in the theta band, which is a frequency band that is thought to be
associated with new information encoding (Klimesch, 1999) and indicates a possible
higher efficient network for information encoding in nature. However, additional studies
are needed to verify this claim.
Measures of the small-world network characteristics, clustering coefficient (Cmean) and
average shortest path length (Lmean) were found to be correlated with “coherence,” which
is a subjective psychological measure that refers to one of the qualities in a restorative
environment when one feels that the environment information is in order, is not chaotic
and is therefore more comprehensible.

1/f statistics, perceived fatigue and vigor
We have also studied the power spectrum properties of EEG signals. The recorded EEG
signals also displayed a reversed power law phenomenon known as the 1/fb statistic. The
1/fb statistic suggests that long-term correlations exist in the time domain. A large b value
means that any two time events in the EEG signal have a relatively large correlation time
constant. A 1/fb power spectrum with power tending to diminish with increasing
frequency indicates arrhythmic activities with no particularly dominating periodic
oscillatory dynamic. EEG signals are more commonly analyzed for rhythmic activity
(Başar et al., 2001), with arrhythmic statistics discarded as noise. Indeed, the arrhythmic
activity may be functional and meaningful during information processing and cognitive
tasks (He, 2011; He, 2014; He et al., 2010; Ray & Maunsell, 2011).
We observed a larger b in the 1/fb statistics during the nature exposure than during the
urban exposure. Additionally, the b values in the right hemisphere are generally higher
than those in the left hemisphere. Because a large b value means that there are more lowfrequency components in the EEG signal, this result suggests slower brain activity without
strong high-frequency spiking activities. Therefore, a large b following nature exposure
herein suggests a more relaxed, less task-loaded state with weaker activities as evidenced by
brain imaging experiments (He, 2011; Ward, 2002). This conclusion is consistent with the
mental states reported by the participants wherein the global average b was positively
associated with the affect changes in vigor (corr. beta = 0.442, p = 0.011) and negatively
associated with fatigue (corr. beta = -0.410, p = 0.020). However, identifying the best
range of b values for the brain in the best performance and/or the most pleasant state will
require a better designed task that should be investigated in future studies.

Limitations
This study makes an initial attempt at understanding brain functional connectivity in
response to environmental exposure. Although interesting evidence about enhanced
functional connectivity in natural environments has been revealed herein, there are a few
limitations.
First, this study only revealed the general impact of un-attentional multisensory
environmental signals on functional connectivity. The study was designed to understand
the holistic in-situ impact of nature and urban environments during a free-exploring
Chen et al. (2016), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.2210

19/25

multisensory naturalistic experience. Our intention was not to draw any causal
connections between specific environmental stimuli and brain activities. To specify exactly
how much different types of signals in the environment impact brain functional
connectivity, more strictly controlled experiments with isolated stimuli and both
controlled saliency and motion will be needed.
Second, this study examined the detailed impact of exposure to very few nature and
urban sites. However, to explore how the results and conclusions could be generalized
across various types of nature and urban sites, more extensive control conditions and
more sites will need to be examined in future studies. We cannot specify whether the
signal statistics, such as the 1/f characteristic, promoted a more efficient information
processing functional network. We also do not know whether we accidently selected a less
information-loaded nature site, which may have afforded an easier and more fluent
cognitive process.
Third, this study used a between-subject design that introduced unnecessary variance.
The between-subject design was adopted to minimize possible learning effects; however,
the design also introduced more individual variance to the designed comparison.
Therefore, a within-subject replicated design would have better controlled for individual
variances.

Implications and future directions
The general observation that brain activities contain long-term correlation and oscillatory
components might reflect interactions between bottom-up information processes and
top-down cognitive feedback. This conclusion requires further investigation to deepen
our understanding of cognitive computation processes within the brain. Constructing
large-scale cortical circuit models to investigate the biophysical mechanism of the 1/f
response and the oscillation characteristics as revealed in this study will be interesting.
The brain response features, which are potentially important to brain functioning
(He, 2014; Watts & Strogatz, 1998), have not been largely considered in current cognitive
computational models. Moreover, the preference of the brain sensory system for the
1/f characteristic may also require further investigation of cortical computational
modeling to reveal the biophysical mechanism underlying cortically efficient coding.
The experimental investigation of the relationship between environmental statistics and
cognitive processing may be valuable for numerous reasons. First, such an investigation
may deepen our understanding of the functional properties of brain sensory systems.
Second, the derivation of new cortical computation models based on environmental
statistics for efficient coding may be fostered. Finally, further investigations might also be
helpful in the design of new forms of stochastic experimental protocols and stimuli for
probing different brain sensory systems.
In summary, our studies suggest that a nature environment, which is characterized by
long-term correlation statistics in visual signals, can evoke different brain oscillatory
activities and arrhythmic activities that may help place brain functioning in a more
restorative experience. Brains generate more memory-like effects of auto-correlated
electrical signals when we are visualizing nature than when we are visualizing a busy urban

environment. This result might be an indication of better memory formation in the
natural environment than in the urban environment. Moreover, this “redundant”
autocorrelation, which is observed for many natural phenomena and neuronal signals,
may be important to our resilience and mental well-being; however, this idea will require
further investigation.

SUMMARY
Increasing experimental evidence has reported that animal sensory neurons process
natural signals more efficiently than artificial signals (Lewen, Bialek & Steveninck, 2001;
Rieke, Bodnar & Bialek, 1995). Computational studies have revealed that the structure and
function of sensory neurons and networks may be designed to efficiently encode signals
from natural environments due to long-term adaptation and evolution mechanisms.
Our study was designed to examine whether the human brain functions more efficiently
in a natural environment than in an urban environment. The answers and underlying
mechanisms related to this question may be critical in understanding the operating
principle of the human brain.
Previous experiments have revealed that a short walk in a natural wooded area may
greatly refresh the brain’s cognitive performance and alleviate negative stressors. Our
study indicated that the distinct statistical properties of urban artifacts may also shape the
human brain response properties differently and may thus further stress human brains.
Additional investigations are needed to more precisely examine the performance
differences observed between these two types of environments.
This study revealed the presence of a more efficient brain network during a nature
experience than during an urban experience. Specifically, stronger global functional
connectivity was observed in nature, and a more enhanced small-world property
with a larger clustering coefficient (Cmean) and a smaller average shortest path length
(Lmean) was also observed, which were most prominent in the theta band. The
enhanced small-world properties were found to be correlated with a “coherent”
experience measured by PRS psychological scale (Hartig et al., 1997), referring to an
orderly, comprehensible environment experience. The more efficient brain network in
nature may help explain the restorative experience reported in this study and may
explain the potential cognitive improvements exhibited shortly after a nature
experience, as observed elsewhere in the literature (Berman, Jonides & Kaplan, 2008;
Bratman et al., 2015a; Taylor & Kuo, 2009).
This study also documented some relevant changes to long-term correlation
characteristics of human EEG signals during in-situ environmental exposures to nature
and to an urban environment. We found a larger b exponent in the 1/fb frequency
spectrum during the nature experience and a larger b in the right hemisphere during the
exposures to nature and to urban environments. This study may be among the earliest
studies of changes in the 1/f power spectrum exponent b of human EEG signals as a
function of different environmental experiences. A larger sample size and repeated
experiments are needed to further investigate the key properties that are intrinsic to the
nature environment that impact the resulting EEG signal statistics. Environmental impact

on the brain functional connectivity characteristics observed in this study may be
beneficial in constructing better cognitive computational models.
