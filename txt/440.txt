Abstract
When executing a task, brain activity can be observed through electric waves recorded in different frequency bands. The main ones are the
Alpha, Beta, Theta and Delta waves. According to some authors, Alpha and Beta waves are related with cognitive capacity and, their
presence and evolution, with an individual’ alertness. In this study, the intention was to evaluate how brain activity is directly influenced
by temperature and humidity while performing a task. Therefore, a set of laboratory tests were undertaken to simulate sedentary work in
two different thermal environments: 18ºC - 40% RH (cold) and 35ºC - 80% RH (hot). In the hot thermal environment, oscillation on
Alpha waves amplitude suggests an alternation between periods of tiredness with periods in which concentration increases. Regarding Beta
waves in the cold thermal environment, most of the time Beta activity is typically higher than that verified in the hot thermal environment.
Keywords: Alpha waves, Beta waves, thermal environmental, cognitive capacity.

Cambios en la amplitud del EEG (ondas Alfa y Beta) con el medio
ambiente térmico
Resumen
Cuando se ejecuta una tarea, puede observarse actividad cerebral através de las ondas eléctricas en diversas bandas de frecuencia. Los
principales son las ondas Alfa, Beta, Theta y Delta. Según algunos autores, las ondas Beta y Alfa están relacionados con la capacidad
cognitiva y, su presencia y evolución, la aparición y evolución, con el estado de alerta de un individuo. En este estudio, la intención fue
evaluar cómo actividad cerebral está directamente influenciada por la temperatura y humedad mientras realiza una tarea. Por lo tanto, se
llevaron a cabo un conjunto de pruebas de laboratorio para simular trabajo sedentario en dos diferentes ambientes térmicos: 18 ºC - 40%
RH (en frío) y 35 ºC - 80% RH (caliente). En el ambiente térmico caliente, la oscilación de amplitud de las ondas alfa sugiere una alternancia
entre periodos de cansancio con los períodos en que aumenta la concentración. Con respecto a las ondas Beta en el ambiente térmico frío,
la mayoría de la actividad Beta es típicamente mayor que el verificado en el ambiente térmico caliente.
Palabras clave: ondas Alfa, ondas Beta, ambiente térmico, capacidad cognitiva.

1. Introduction
1.1. Occupational risk and thermal environmental
The economic and social development that has taken
place throughout the 20th century has been accompanied by
a greater awareness of work safety and health problems and

also by the development of protective measures for workers.
The objective has been to minimize risk. Despite these
efforts, there are still working situations that can be very
harmful to workers’ safety and health. One of these situations
is related to workers who perform activities in “extreme”
thermal environments, even if these are sedentary activities.
It is pertinent to assess the relationship between thermal

associated with different psychological states, which
include low levels of alertness and, consequently, is
associated with the decrease in the capacity to process
information. Theta frequency can also be considered a
"slow wave" [12].
• Alpha waves– This type is dominant in adult human
brains, and has a frequency of between 8 Hz and 13 Hz.
The waves´ presence is common in the occipital cortex,
during the period of wakefulness. Whenever the eyes are
closed, the presence of this type of waves is common.
When head wavers due to fatigue occurs, and when trying
to be aware, Alpha wave activity decreases [11]. The
presence of these waves during when the individual is
awake and in a state of relaxation, leads to a slow
response to stimuli [13].
• Beta waves– These have a frequency of between 13 Hz
and 30 Hz, which indicates a high propagation speed.
Their presence is associated with a state of arousal/alert.
Beta activity can occur in humans while performing a
motor task that requires high reaction time [14].
This study aims to contribute by establishing a
relationship between thermal environment, and the signal
amplitude of brain waves (Alpha and Beta), in particular the
cognitive performance of individuals under uncomfortable
environmental conditions.

environment and cognitive capacity since all human activity
is influenced by the surrounding environment, including
working activities. This allows the question of how thermal
environment influences human being’s responsiveness to be
clarified. Over the course of undertaking this research, we
found several studies on the subject that have been performed
in controlled environments, such as climatic chambers [1-5].
Furthermore some of the relevant literature [6,7] states that
thermal environment can have a negative impact on
performance, particularly when combined with other
variables such as exposition time or task duration.
With increased technological development the workplace
assumes a greater complexity. This increased complexity
often brings additional risks for workers. Increasing
technological complexity requires, from the worker, an
increased cognitive performance, which may be jeopardized
due to an inadequate thermal environment.

2. Materials and Method
2.1. Main equipment
Monitoring and data collection was done using specific
equipment. Table 1 presents the equipment that was used and
its respective functions. After all the equipment [15] to be
used was selected, each piece was tested and validated under
trial protocol [16].
2.2. General trial conditions

1.2. Influence of environment in human ability

The relationship between cognitive capacity, thermal
environment and brain waves was evaluated by performing
experimental trials with 10 male volunteers. Their ages were
between 18 and 36 years old, with an average of 26±6 years.
In these trials, each volunteer performed two cognitive
tests. The first was held at 18ºC - 40% RH, and the second
was done seven days later at 35ºC - 80% RH. All the trials
were performed between 6:00 pm and 8:00 pm. The
operating conditions were simulated within a Climate
Chamber with an error of ±1ºC and ±2% RH.

The way that each individual feels the surrounding
environment is influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors
from the individual himself [8,9]. Tolerance to environment
depends directly on, among others factors, age, aerobic
capacity, hours of rest, lifestyle and consumption of
medicines. These factors can be classified as shown in Fig. 1.
All of these strongly influence the feeling of well-being.
The psychophysiological and physiological factors mean that
different individuals in similar environmental conditions feel
the conditions to which they are exposed differently.

1.3. Characterization and interpretation of brain waves
Monitorization and interpretation of brain waves can
clarify how cognitive capacity is influenced by the thermal
environment. The different types of brain waves / activities
are:
• Delta Activity– is referred to as a "slow wave"; it is in the
frequency range between 0.5 Hz and 4 Hz. This type of
activity is recorded in the transitional phase for sleep and
during sleep [11].
• Teta Frequency– this lies between 4 Hz and 7 Hz. Itis

given instructions. Each volunteer undertook a one hour task,
in this case, the Go / No-Go test [20] (Fig. 4) and completed
it as successfully as possible. Go/No-Go is a selective
attention test that does not have learning effects over the
results as is totally random.
Before starting the test, we explained what we intended
to happen and the risks to the volunteer and an informed
consent was signed. The study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the University of Porto (nº04 CEUP/2012).

2.3. Questionnaires
Each volunteer was submitted to each one of the
environmental conditions for 60 minutes after a stabilization
period of 20 minutes outside the chamber (in the laboratory)
at a temperature between 20ºC and 22ºC and a relative
humidity between 55% RH and 65% RH. After this period,
the volunteer who entered the climatic chamber waited for 10
minutes under environmental test conditions before
beginning the essay. These 10 minutes were used to install an
EEG device on the volunteer´s head. The total time for each
experiment was 90 minutes. Control of skin temperature was
undertaken at two points, one on the neck and the other on
the forehead of the volunteer, as shown in Fig. 2. In all the
tests, all volunteers were dressed with 0,7 clo.
For the trials at 35ºC - 80% RH, core temperature was
also controlled. In total were conducted 20 tests. Skin
temperature allowed individual stabilization to be controlled.
Core temperature allows signs of thermal stress to be
identified, especially when the organism was exposed to high
temperatures (35ºC - 80% RH) [19]. This monitoring also
allows the risks of excessive exposure to heat to be
minimized.
To evaluate brain activity we used a specific interface
(brain computer interface) that allowed Alpha and Beta
waves to be registered. Only brain waves from the left and
right occipital were studied. The occipital lobe is related to
the visual sense and to the ability to process information and
understanding its contents.
All selected volunteers were male. To obtain a highquality signal, all electrodes must be connected (in green), as
is shown in Fig. 3.
Volunteers’ cognitive capacity was stimulated by
performing a "game/task". Each individual had to follow the

Before entering the Climate Chamber the volunteer
answered 4 questions in order to assess their lifestyle,
namely: a -Ingested caffeinated drinks in the last 12 hours?;
b -Ingested alcoholic drinks in the last 12 hours?; c - Any
medicine taken?; d - Good overnight rest?
These questions are relevant as they allow us to know if
the volunteer is tired at the beginning of the test and,
therefore, if task performance could be affected by other
factors in addition to temperature and humidity.
Once the test was completed (1 hour), all the equipment
was turned off, and the volunteer leaves the Climatic
Chamber.

Results and discussion

3.1. Lifestyle
The answers given by the volunteers about their lifestyle
before starting the tests helped to interpret the results (Table
2). Lifestyle can interfere with the results, for example,
disguising fatigue (coffee) or reducing concentration power
(alcohol).
Although some volunteers had a lifestyle that may
influence the results (gray in Table 2), i.e. inserting biases in
the results, we decided to include them if they are usual
consumers of small doses.
3.2. Skin and core body temperature
Fig. 5 shows the evolution of the skin temperature
average in the forehead and neck at 18ºC - 40% RH for the
ten volunteers. Fig. 6 shows the evolution of skin temperature

average at 35ºC - 80% RH at the same skin points. In both
environments, skin temperature stabilizes. This level is
clearer on the forehead and for hot temperatures. It is also
interesting to notice that in hot environments, on both control
points, neck and forehead, the temperature value has almost
the same value after stabilization.
The core body temperature that was measured only in the
hot environment (35ºC - 80% RH) shows a great stability
over time (Fig. 7).

3.3. Brain activity
Figs. 8 to 11 represent the average results for recorded
brain activity. When Figs. 8 and 9 are compared with the
Figs. 10 and 11, it is possible to confirm thermal
environmental influence on brain activity (Alpha and Beta
waves’ amplitude). For the colder environment (18ºC - 40%
RH) Alpha activity is far superior to that obtained in the hot
environment (35ºC - 80% RH). This excludes the
occasionally-raised hypothesis that the perspiration is the
main cause of the occurrence of high values of the EEG
signal for hot environments.
In a state of wakefulness in which the volunteers are
concentrated (eyes open), Alpha activity is usually small. As
individuals become fatigued Alpha, activity is expected to
increase. However, when time goes on, in the case of the
trials at 35ºC - 80% RH (Fig. 8), only a small decrease in
Alpha activity can be observed, which does not verify the
expected trend. For the trials at 18ºC and 40% RH (Fig. 9),
there is a decrease in Alpha activity in the first part of the test
(20-30 min); this then increases until Alpha activity
maintains values that are close to the initial values. The
increase in Alpha activity suggests an increase of
tiredness/fatigue in the volunteers.
Another relevant fact is the discrepancy of activity
between the right and left brain hemispheres for hot thermal
environments. In the left area of the brain (occipital 1) the
range values activity is between 4-9 µV while in right area
(occipital 2) this range rises to 11-19 µV (Fig. 8). It seems
that in a hot thermal environment the temperature and relative
humidity affect the left and right hemispheres differently.
According to several studies [11], Beta activity is
considered the one that best describes alertness/arousal.
In a cold thermal environment, Beta activity is typically
higher than the activity verified for the hot thermal
environment.
It is usually considered that a decrease in Beta activity is
related to the loss of the ability to concentration (reduction of
surveillance), which was be verified throughout the trial. It is
therefore possible to consider that cold thermal environments
(Fig. 10) are conducive to higher levels of
concentration/alertness than hot environments (Fig. 11).

When comparing the activity between left side and right
side of the brain, the activity in the occipital 1 (left) is lower
than the one verified in occipital 2 (right).

most relevant frequencies, which facilitates understanding of
the evolution of individual´s cognitive state.
With the analysis of the Alpha /Beta ratio, it is possible to
observe the evolution of fatigue/tiredness over time. Theoretically
an increase in fatigue levels over the trial time is expected, and the
consequent tendency is to increase the Alpha/Beta values ratio.

frequency bands (Alpha and Beta) it is possible to calculate
the Alpha/Beta ratio. This ratio is developed to relate the two

However, this expectation was only applied to the
occipital 2 for 35ºC - 80% RH (Fig. 12) and very dimly at the
end of the test in the cold thermal environment in occipital 1
(Fig. 13).
Interpreting Alpha and Beta wave activity still lacks
scientific unanimity. It is commonplace that different studies
reveal completely diverse results and interpretations. Some
authors report that Alpha waves show changes at different
temperature [21], and others report that alpha and beta
increase at either 17ºC or 28ºC [4].
A comparison of both hemispheres can be seen in Table
3; when the average amplitude of Alpha waves increases,
there is a decrease in the amplitude of Beta waves. This
concurs with Eoh et al.´s results [22].

4. Conclusions

[12]

In hot thermal environment Alpha activity tends to
decrease over the course of the task/test, for both areas of the
occipital lobe. In the cold thermal environment, Alpha
activity decreases for half the time of the test (30 min) and
then rises, showing an increase for both areas of the occipital
lobe. This means that a bigger effort was made.
Beta activity for the hot thermal environment is quite
small on the left side of the occipital lobe (Fig. 10 and Table
3); a downward activity is shown as the task was being
developed. In tests undertaken in a cold thermal environment,
Beta activity decreases for approximately half of the test time
(30 min), and then it tends to increase at the end of the trials.
The results support the idea that the different areas of the
brain, in this case the left and right occipital lobes, are
affected differently by the same environmental conditions.
