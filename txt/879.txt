Understanding the neurobiological basis of individual differences in second language acquisition (SLA) is
important for research on bilingualism, learning, and neural plasticity. The current study used quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to predict SLA in college-aged individuals. Baseline, eyes-closed
resting-state qEEG was used to predict language learning rate during eight weeks of French exposure
using an immersive, virtual scenario software. Individual qEEG indices predicted up to 60% of the
variability in SLA, whereas behavioral indices of fluid intelligence, executive functioning, and workingmemory capacity were not correlated with learning rate. Specifically, power in beta and low-gamma
frequency ranges over right temporoparietal regions were strongly positively correlated with SLA.
These results highlight the utility of resting-state EEG for studying the neurobiological basis of SLA in
a relatively construct-free, paradigm-independent manner.

1. Introduction
Learning a second language in adulthood is dramatically more
difficult than doing so as a child. For example, large individual differences in SLA exist (e.g., Dörnyei, 2009), with only a small portion
of adult learners reaching native-like fluency. Such differences are
likely underpinned, in part, by factors related to neural plasticity
(see Wong, Morgan-Short, Ettlinger, & Zheng, 2012 for discussion).
Due to this fact, investigations of second language acquisition (SLA)
in adulthood have become a cornerstone of research on human
neural plasticity. Thus, understanding the nature of individual differences in SLA is critical for both research on second language
acquisition itself, and also more generally for research on human
learning and neural plasticity. In addition to the centrality of this
research for basic science, being able to identify which individuals
will achieve second language fluency with ease or difficulty has
important broader applications for education and industry.
In a recent review, Biedroń (2015) highlights the need for further neuroscientific research to inform theories of second language
‘‘aptitude,” a construct traditionally referring to behavioral indices
that predict the ease with which an individual will be able to
acquire a second language. The review by Biedroń discusses the
likelihood that heterogeneity of the construct of second language
aptitude has limited the impact of research investigating its neural

basis (Biedroń, 2015, pp. 15–160). With the current experiment,
we show that one way in which neuroscientific research can
inform theories of language aptitude is to investigate stable aspects
of brain functioning in a paradigm-free manner and relate the
indices obtained to second language aptitude.
While existing research on the neurobiological basis of second
language aptitude has provided promising results, the majority of
this research has focused on understanding the neural correlates
of acoustic or phonological processes (e.g., Chandrasekaran,
Kraus, & Wong, 2012; Golestani, Molko, Dehaene, LeBihan, &
Pallier, 2007; Golestani & Zatorre, 2004; Hu et al., 2013; Reiterer,
Hu, Sumathi, & Singh, 2013). However, recent research has shown
that phonological processes explain a rather small, sometimes
insignificant (Linck et al., 2013), portion of the variance in SLA.
In fact, an increasing number of contemporary studies have
highlighted the importance of general cognitive mechanisms such
as implicit or procedural learning (e.g., Linck et al., 2013; MorganShort, Faretta-Stutenberg, Brill-Schuetz, Carpenter, & Wong, 2014)
and working memory capacity (e.g., Juffs & Harrington, 2011;
Miyake & Friedman, 1998) for predicting second language learning.
Unfortunately, very little research to date has related aspects of
neural functioning known to underlie such general cognitive abilities with second language aptitude (see Chee, Soon, Lee, &
Pallier, 2004, for one example).
Neuroscientific research has been instrumental, however, in
informing theories about the relation between general cognitive
abilities such as working memory capacity and native language
abilities (see Prat, 2011 for a review). This body of functional

C.S. Prat et al. / Brain & Language 157–158 (2016) 44–50

magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography
(EEG) research has highlighted the importance of network-level
characterizations of brain function. Specifically, neural efficiency
(Maxwell, Fenwick, Fenton, & Dollimore, 1974; Prat, Keller, &
Just, 2007) and neural synchronization (Prat & Just, 2011; Prat
et al., 2007) have been identified as stable characteristics of
more-skilled, or higher-capacity native language comprehenders.
Perhaps the earliest and most commonly used neural indices of
general cognitive abilities are quantitative EEG (qEEG) measures.
Nearly 50 years of research have shown that various qEEG indices
extracted from eyes-closed resting-state EEG data are stable and
highly accurate predictors of performance on a variety of cognitive
tests (e.g., Doppelmayr, Klimesch, Stadler, Poellhuber, & Heine,
2002; Giannitrapani, 1969). More recently, research comparing
qEEG indices in monozygotic and dizygotic twins has shown that
qEEG profiles are highly heritable, and also correlate with indices
of brain structure such as grey and white matter volumes (Smit,
Boomsma, Schnack, Hulshoff Pol, & de Geus, 2012). Thus, qEEG is
an ideal method for relating stable properties of brain functioning
to SLA.
One common form of qEEG analysis involves converting electrophysiological recordings from the time domain to the frequency
domain, and measuring the distribution of power across different
frequencies over various electrode locations (Gudmundsson,
Runarsson, Sigurdsson, Eiriksdottir, & Johnsen, 2007). Power estimates are then averaged across predetermined intervals that correspond to the frequency bands of cognitively relevant brain
activity (Basßar, Basßar-Eroglu, Karakasß, & Schürmann, 2001). While
a considerable amount of research has gone into understanding
the neurocognitive implications of such frequency bands (see
Ward, 2003 for review), much work is yet to be done. It seems
plausible that different frequencies serve unique network-level
functions (for instance in establishing local versus long-distance
coherence); however, the precise role that each frequency band
plays in complex cognitive processes remains an active area of
investigation.
A few studies to date have looked specifically at online qEEG
power distributions during linguistic tasks (see Weiss & Mueller,
2003, 2012 for reviews). These studies have implicated beta (13–
30 Hz) and theta (4–8 Hz) rhythms in linguistic processing. This
is not particularly surprising, as both frequency bands have been
implicated more broadly in memory encoding and retrieval processes (e.g., Hanslmayr, Staudigl, & Fellner, 2012; Klimesch,
Doppelmayr, Schimke, & Ripper, 1997; Weiss & Mueller, 2003,
2012; Weiss & Rappelsberger, 2000). To the best of our knowledge,
however, very little research has related static (or resting state)
qEEG indices to linguistic ability (see Maxwell et al., 1974 for
one exception), or to second language aptitude.
The goal of this study was to extend previous findings showing
that stable, network-level properties of brain functioning relate
strongly to general intelligence (Giannitrapani, 1969) and to native
language abilities (Prat & Just, 2011; Prat et al., 2007), by using
qEEG to predict success of second language learning in adulthood.
To do so, we recorded 5 min. of eyes-closed resting-state EEG from
healthy monolingual adults, in addition to a psychometric battery
that included measures of working memory capacity, nonverbal
reasoning, and executive functioning. Subsequently, participants
were exposed to French using the Operational Language and Culture Training System (OLCTS), a language training program which
uses an immersive, goal-directed virtual reality software designed
to provide military personnel with rapid acquisition of functional
fluency in a second language. The OLCTS is organized hierarchically
according to different goals and scenarios (e.g., clearing customs
and getting transportation). Within each goal, the material is presented in a scaffolded manner, moving from explicit translation
through interactions with progressively fewer hints. Feedback is

45

given continuously, based on speech production, and auditory
and written comprehension, with more points received for completing scenarios with fewer hints required. Behavioral metrics
and qEEG indices were used to predict the rate at which individuals acquired an L2 by moving through the levels of the OLCTS.

2. Results
2.1. Individual differences in language learning
Consistent with previous research, large variability was
observed in final language proficiency level achieved, with the fastest learner progressing more than twice as quickly through the
training program than the slowest learner (range = level 8–19,
mean = level 13.25, sd = 3.8). Individual learning curves are
depicted in Fig. 1.
Learning was best explained by a linear function in all participants, with R2 values for individual participant’s data ranging from
0.93 to 0.99. With intercepts fixed at the origin, beta values (or
learning slopes) extracted for each participant were used to characterize learning rate (range = 0.58–1.24, mean = 0.88, sd = 0.21).
All individuals performed well on individually tailored comprehension tests which included only the materials covered by that
individual (mean = 94%, sd = 7%). Furthermore, no correlation was
observed between final level achieved and final comprehension
score of the material. This is not particularly surprising because
(as described in the methods), the OLCTS intermittently tested
individuals on comprehension, production, and memory of materials covered, and participants were not allowed to advance past a
level until a minimum proficiency was achieved. Taken together,
these results suggest that individual differences in language learning rate were related to second language aptitude, rather than to
differences in criteria for comprehension used to advance through
the training.

2.2. Behavioral indices of cognitive ability and L2 learning rates
None of the correlations between behavioral measures collected
and language learning rate reached significance (all ps > 0.10).
These correlations and their uncorrected p values are listed in
the supplementary materials.

(r = 0.54–0.58) over frontal (FC5/FC6) and temporal (T7/T8) regions
as well as for low-beta power (r = 0.57) over the temporal regions
(T7/T8), as listed in Table 2.

2.3. Resting-state qEEG and L2 learning rates
Resting-state qEEG indices were robustly correlated with language learning rate, explaining up to 60% of the variance observed
(see Table 1). This value was calculated from the R2 values, i.e., the
squared Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (not the
Spearman’s r), which is an accurate indication of the percentage
of variance in the language rate explained by resting EEG power.
The most predictive frequency band was low-beta (13–14.5 Hz),
with significant positive correlations between low-beta power
and L2 learning rates ranging from r = 0.60–0.77 over the right
hemisphere (RH) homologues of left hemisphere (LH) frontal and
posterior temporal language regions (F8 and T8) as well as over
the parietal lobe (P8). Positive correlations between mid-beta
(15–17.5 Hz, r = 0.52–0.71), high-beta (18–29.5 Hz, r = 0.52–0.56),
low-gamma (30–40 Hz, r = 0.52–0.7), and L2 learning rate were
observed over more distributed regions including bilateral frontal
(AF3, F7, F8 and FC6) and RH temporo-parietal regions (T8 and
P8). The distribution and magnitude of these positive correlations
is depicted in Fig. 2, along with a scatterplot of the individual data
from three frequency ranges over the right temporal lobe.
Power in the theta frequency band (4–7.5 Hz) was negatively
correlated with L2 learning rate (r = 0.58) in the left parietal lobe
(P7) only.

3. Discussion
Our results demonstrate that stable properties of network-level
brain functioning at rest, as measured by qEEG, were robust and
reliable predictors of subsequent individual differences in second
language learning. The best of these single variables, right hemisphere low-beta power, explained 60% of the variability in final
language level achieved after eight weeks of training. Although
beta frequency ranges have previously been shown to relate to
online language and memory processes (Hanslmayr et al., 2012;
Weiss & Mueller, 2012), to the best of our knowledge, no research
to date has related resting-state beta power to subsequent language aptitude. Because qEEG was not measured during or after
L2 learning, it is not yet clear how these results relate to the related
work of McLaughlin, Osterhout and colleagues, who have shown
that electrophysiological measures are sensitive to changes in neural organization following L2 exposure (McLaughlin, Osterhout, &
Kim, 2004) and that such changes are related to L2 proficiency
(Tanner, McLaughlin, Herschensohn, & Osterhout, 2013). We see
this as an important area for future SLA research.
Consistent with previous research in the field of intelligence
(Thatcher, North, & Biver, 2005), we also found that more lateralized distributions of alpha power was correlated with faster language learning. These results are also consistent with previous
individual differences research showing that more lateral patterns
of brain activation are correlated with increased linguistic skill in
first language (L1) comprehenders (Prat et al., 2011). Interestingly,
previous research has also shown that second language (L2) representations are more variable than are L1 representations, and
include the RH more frequently (e.g., Dehaene et al., 1997). Additionally, a recent investigation of second language learning showed

2.4. Laterality effects
Based on previous neural efficiency findings suggesting that less
linguistically skilled native language speakers use more RH than do
more linguistically skilled individuals (Prat, Long, and Baynes,
2007; Prat, Mason, & Just, 2011), laterality indices were computed
over each frequency range using the seven pairs of homologous
electrodes (see methods section). More lateralized patterns of
brain activation were predictive of better SLA. This was manifest
by positive correlations between laterality indices for alpha power

that white matter organization in the RH (but not the LH) predicted
the ability of native English speakers to acquire Mandarin in adulthood (Qi, Han, Garel, San Chen, & Gabrieli, 2015).
Taken together, our qEEG results suggest that power in RH electrodes, and laterality coefficients derived from them, correlated
with L2 learning rates. Note that the qEEG indices reported herein
are measured at the scalp, with no source localization algorithms
applied. Thus, this data in isolation doesn’t warrant inferences
about lateralized neural generators. However, in light of the previous individual differences results using functional (Prat et al.,
2011) and structural (Qi et al., 2015) neuroimaging, it does seem
plausible that variability in RH functioning relates to L2 learning
rate. This is not to say that the RH plays a bigger role in L2 learning
than does the LH. In fact, a recent review of structural changes
associated with L2 learning showed that increases in grey matter
density with L2 learning were bilaterally distributed, and that
changes in LH density were most frequently associated with L2
proficiency (Li, Legault, & Litcofsky, 2014). Additionally, a metaanalysis by Hull and Vaid (2007) showed that in late L2 learners,
greater LH involvement was associated with poorer L2 proficiency.
It remains to be seen, then, whether the results described herein
are specific to the role of the RH in L2 learning rate, or whether
they reflect some more stable index of language processing more
generally (e.g., more efficient L1 processes). A third possibility,
supported by the intelligence literature, is that these results reflect
a general neural efficiency that is not language specific. We see this
as an interesting avenue for future research.
The data presented in this report are not without limitations.
First, the sample size was relatively small, with only 16 individuals
completing the language training (75% of which were female).

Thus, the lack of significant correlations between behavioral
indices and language learning rates may simply reflect a lack of
power. Additionally, it is possible that the significant qEEG results
described herein may not generalize to the larger population. However, the fact that many of the relations between qEEG and SLA
described herein are consistent with previous research (such as
the phenomena described above) bolster our confidence in the
fidelity of these results.
Another limitation of this study is that the amount of language
training administered was relatively small (eight hours total training distributed across 16, 30-min sessions). By comparison, the
research of Ando and colleagues relating working memory capacity
to second language learning (Ando et al., 1992 as translated and
described in Miyake & Friedman, 1998) involved 20 h of classroom
instruction. It is not clear, however, how to compare the amount of
learning that occurs during one hour of classroom based curriculum to that which occurs in one hour of interaction with the OLCTS.
The OLCTS provides an immersive and individualized training
experience, and was specifically designed with the goal of getting
individuals in the armed forces functionally proficient in a second
language over a short period of time. Additionally, other research
on SLA has focused on concentrated language learning over even
shorter periods of time (e.g., Qi et al., 2015). Nonetheless, further
exploration will be needed to see whether these results are specific
to initial language learning phases, or whether the predictive utility of the qEEG indices recorded will be sustained over longer periods of training. Future research should also explore whether or not
the same predictors are relevant for qualitatively different types of
training such as that provided in a canonical L2 classroom.
Finally, the critical dependent variable predicted by qEEG in the
current experiment was rate of language learning, which, in itself,
does not provide much information about the quality of language
learning attained. The fact that comprehension test scores did
not correlate with either qEEG or behavioral measures is likely a
reflection of the fact that there was almost no variability in final
comprehension of the material covered (with a mean score of
94%). These results suggest that all learners mastered the material
covered in the training levels they completed. It is also worth

48

C.S. Prat et al. / Brain & Language 157–158 (2016) 44–50

noting that in order to pass a level, language learners needed to
pass quizzes that involved speech production and comprehension
components as well as multiple-choice questions. If we had given
everyone the same, comprehensive French test at the end of training, instead of tailoring comprehension to the materials covered by
each individual, it is likely that much larger individual differences
would have been observed, and that such differences would relate
to the same indices of qEEG that predicted rate of learning. Our
future research will explore a richer investigation of the quality
of second language skills attained by faster- and slower-learners
(e.g., syntactic parsing, phonological processing skills, vocabulary
size) and how they may differentially relate to qEEG predictors.
Despite these limitations, the potential power of this approach
can be seen by comparing the predictive utility of qEEG with those
obtained from standard measures of complex reasoning ability and
working memory capacity, which were not significantly related to
second language learning with the sample size tested herein. In
contrast, the best qEEG predictors were correlated with language
level achieved with rs > 0.77, with ps < 0.001. Thus, our results
show that qEEG indices collected from resting-state data provide
a powerful, paradigm-free tool for predicting second language
learning. Because qEEG power spectra are known to be genetically
based (Smit et al., 2012) but experientially modifiable (see
Gruzelier, 2014 for review), we believe this research has important
implications not only for studying second language aptitude, but
also for developing paradigms to modify it.
4. Methods
4.1. Participants
Nineteen healthy young adults (18–31 yrs) were initially
recruited as part of a larger study investigating how various language and cognitive training protocols shape the brain and behavior. Of these, 16 participants (12 female) completed the eight-week
language training program, and only their data are reported herein.
All participants were monolingual English speakers, with no exposure to a second language before high school, and with low proficiency in any language learned after high school. Additionally,
any individual with exposure to French was excluded from participation. All individuals gave informed consent in accordance with
the standards set forth by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board and were paid for their participation.
4.2. Psychometric measures
A battery of psychometric assessments was given before language training. These assessments consisted of ten computerized
and paper-and-pencil measures of cognitive, reasoning, and first
language reading abilities. In addition, a paper-and-pencil
French-English Translation test was given to each subject following
language training. Descriptions of each task or a reference to such
are provided below. One to two variable values were entered for
each participant, for each task, corresponding to the measure most
typically used to index individual differences in that task.
4.2.1. Measures of general reasoning ability
4.2.1.1. Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM). The RAPM is
a timed test of nonverbal reasoning abilities. In this task, participants choose the best option, among 8 alternatives, that completes
a pattern displayed across a matrix of items. A shortened 18-item
version of this task (sRAPM) was used in this study. Using the item
difficulty ratings reported by Arthur and Day (1994), the original
36 questions were split into two 18-item tests of matched difficulty. Participants were given 20 min to complete the sRAPM.

Performance was measured as the proportion of correctly solved
problems.
4.2.2. Measures of executive functioning
4.2.2.1. Response-Interference Task. The Response-Interference Task
is a nonverbal measure of susceptibility to stimulus-response
interference. In this task participants respond with left and right
button presses to visually presented shapes (e.g., circle = right,
square = left). 75% of the trials are congruent, with shapes appearing on the same side of the screen as the correct response (e.g., circle on RIGHT side of the screen), and the remaining 25% of the trials
are incongruent, with shapes appearing on the opposite side as the
correct response (e.g., circle on LEFT side of screen). Interference
management was computed by subtracting response times for
congruent trials from incongruent trials (for correct responses
only).
4.2.2.2. 3-back updating task. The 3-back task is a variant of the
canonical n-back test of updating believed to measure working
memory abilities. In this task participants are presented with a series of letters to which they are to respond ‘‘Same” (if the letter presented was the same as the letter presented 3 items ago) or
‘‘Different” (if the letter presented was different than the letter presented 3 items ago). Overall percent accuracy and accuracy to distractor trials (trials in which a letter was presented 1–2 items away
from the target) were calculated separately and both entered as
variables of interest for this task.
4.2.2.3. Color-shape switching task. The Color-Shape Switch task is a
task-switching paradigm that measures mental set-shifting abilities. In this task, participants are presented with blue and orange
circles and squares. Contingent on the location of the stimulus
(top or bottom of screen), participants either respond to whether
the stimulus is a circle or square (when the stimulus is displayed
on the top of the screen) or whether the stimulus is orange or blue
(when the stimulus is displayed on the bottom of the screen).
Switching ability was measured by subtracting response times
from trials in which the task repeated from those in which the task
switched, for correct trials only.
4.2.2.4. A-X continuous performance test of goal maintenance (AXCPT). A shortened version of the traditional AX-CPT task (Cohen,
Barch, Carter, & Servan-Schreiber, 1999) was used in this study.
In this task, participants are presented with a series of letters to
which they must respond to according to two task rules: (1)
respond ‘‘Target” when an X is presented after an A and (2) respond
‘‘Non-Target” for all other situations. Goal maintenance was measured by subtracting reaction times for trials that contained a target that was not preceded by an A (BX trials) from those in which A
was not followed by a target (AY trials).
4.2.2.5. The Probabilistic Stimulus Selection Task of implicit learning. The Probabilistic Stimulus Selection Task measures individual
differences in learning from positive and negative feedback in a
repeated-choice decision-making task (for methods see Frank,
Seeberger, & O’reilly, 2004). Sensitivity to the most frequently
rewarding stimulus (Choose Accuracy) and sensitivity to the least
frequently rewarding stimulus (Avoid Accuracy) were entered as
indices of implicit statistical learning.
4.2.2.6. Attentional Blink task. The Attentional Blink task examines
the temporal limitations of perceptual attention. In this rapid serial
visual presentation task, participants are presented with a series of
letters within which two targets numbers are embedded. Participants are instructed to recall the two target numbers, in order,
after each trial. The lag between the onset of the first target

C.S. Prat et al. / Brain & Language 157–158 (2016) 44–50

number and the onset of the second target number was varied. A
participant’s ‘‘attentional blink” was measured by the difference
between their conditional accuracies (i.e., mean accuracy for the
second target on the trials in which the first target was also successfully recalled) when the lag between the two targets was
within the ‘‘blink window” (100–500 ms) versus outside of that
window (<100 ms or >500 ms).
4.2.2.7. Stop-signal response inhibition task. The Stop Signal task as
described by Logan (1994) was used to measure indices of
response inhibition. For each participant, response inhibition was
calculated as the last moment in time after a subject has initiated
a response that they were able to then inhibit that response.
4.2.2.8. Complex working memory span tasks. Both the computerized Operation and Reading Span tasks were employed as
described in Unsworth, Heitz, Schrock, & Engle, 2005. Span scores
were used for both tasks.
4.2.3. Measures of language proficiency
4.2.3.1. Nelson-Denny Test of L1 reading ability. The Nelson-Denny
Reading Test is a timed multiple-choice English reading assessment normed for college levels. The 38 question passage comprehension portion of this test was used in the current study.
Brown, Fishco, and Hanna (1993) provides a detailed description
of the methods for this test. Normed percentiles for college readers
were calculated based on raw scores and used to indicate reading
comprehension ability.
4.2.3.2. The French-English Translation test of French proficiency. French-English Translation multiple-choice tests were created individually for each participant based on the total amount of
materials they had encountered over the course of eight-weeks of
language training. Participants were instructed to indicate the correct English translation for 50 French words or phrases previously
encountered during their training. The number of items drawn
from each level were proportional to the amount of material covered on that level. Accuracy (total items correct/50) was used to
indicate performance on the French-English translation test.
4.2.3.3. French language learning rate. The OLCTS (Johnson,
Friedland, Watson & Surface, 2012), a virtual immersion language
training program, was used to provide participants with 8-weeks
of French language training. The OLCTS provides immersive, goaldirected cultural and customs training including comprehension
and production components (with speech recognition software),
as well as socio-cultural practices such as pragmatics. These skills
are applied through goal-directed virtual reality scenarios, and
then tested explicitly through quizzes that incorporate all aspects
of linguistic proficiency (written, verbal production, and auditory
comprehension). At the end of each 30-minute training session,
the final level reached for each participant was recorded. Learning
rate was indexed by fitting a line to the data points from 16 training sessions, and using the slope of the line to indicate learning
rate.
4.3. Procedures
After signing informed consent, five minutes of eyes-closed
resting-state EEG were collected from all participants using wireless EPOC 16-channel headsets (Emotiv, Australia) at a sampling
rate of 128 Hz. Three hours of psychometric testing were then collected across two tests sessions. The tests described above were
collected in varying order across participants. Subsequently, all
participants completed sixteen 30-min sessions of language training (using the OCLTS) over the course of eight weeks. Participants

49

were allowed to move through the training at their own pace, but
were not allowed to advance to the next level until they had passed
the corresponding quizzes on that level with an accuracy of 50% or
higher.
4.4. qEEG analysis
EEG data were analyzed using the procedures described in
Doppelmayr et al. (2002), with minor variations to fit our equipment. For the purposes of this experiment, power analyses were
chosen over coherence analyses, due to their established link with
grey matter densities (Smit et al., 2012). The 5-minute recording
was first segmented into 2-second epochs with a 1-second overlap.
Epochs where eyeblinks or significant motion artifacts (as recorded
by the Emotiv built-in eyelid muscle sensors and gyroscope)
occurred were discarded, and only channels with >75 artifactfree epochs per individual were included in the final analysis.
The mean log power spectrum between 1.5 and 40 Hz was calculated by first computing each epoch’s power spectrum using the
Fast Fourier Transform, log-transforming it, and then averaging
the resulting power spectra across all epochs. To reduce spectral
leakage, a Hanning window was applied to each epoch before computing the corresponding Fourier transform. The mean log power
was then separately calculated across theta (4–7.5 Hz), alpha (8–
12.5 Hz), beta (13–29.5 Hz), and low-gamma (30–40 Hz) frequency
bands for each channel and in each participant. Delta (<4 Hz) and
high-gamma (>40 Hz) frequencies were not analyzed due to susceptibility to artifact.
To better understand how these results link to existing
literature, two follow-up analyses were conducted. First, Beta
power calculated separately across three frequency ranges:
low-beta (13–14.5 Hz), mid-beta (15–17.5 Hz), and high-beta
(18–29.5 Hz). Second, eight laterality coefficients were computed
by taking the mean power in each frequency band in the left hemisphere (LH) and subtracting it from the homologous region in the
right hemisphere (RH), then dividing this difference by the average
power in both channels e.g., (low-beta power in T8 – low-beta
power in T7)/average (low-beta power in T7 and T8). To correct
for multiple comparisons in the EEG data, the False Discovery Rate
procedure (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995) was applied, using a
corrected threshold q < 0.05, which corresponded to an uncorrected
threshold of t p < 0.007.
