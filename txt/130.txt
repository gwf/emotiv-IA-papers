Abstract. The identification of the best housing alternatives is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including supply,
demand, social, cultural, psychological, personal factors. All of these factors have an effect on the behavior and emotional
state of a home buyer. What are the most effective ways to choose a home when there is a plethora of complex choices? To
determine the most effective choice, neuroscience techniques can be used. These techniques are classified in the following
main groups in the article: 1) momentary techniques for measuring changes in electronic neuronal activity, 2) techniques
for measuring changes in metabolic neuronal activity, 3) techniques for measuring changes in psychological response to a
stimulus. Article’s analysis, its identification of advantages and disadvantages of the techniques, representing these groups:
electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, functional semi-infrared spectroscopy, eye capture, and
galvanic skin reactions, has revealed the potential of using latter techniques in making marketing decisions, while working
with target audiences of different ages, life experiences, character traits who want to live where they feel best.
Keywords: developed environment, housing, buildings, neuroscience, electroencephalography, eye capture.

Introduction
In the field of housing development, preparing a project
for the object and implementing it is no longer enough.
Just as in other business sectors, in addition to already existing technological challenges, there are problems, which
are now solved by using solutions from relatively distant
areas of science. One of these areas with a significant impact on housing development, is marketing, which, in the
face of increasing interdisciplinarity, is gaining undeniable
importance and weight, in order to meet consumer needs
even in highly technology intensive markets. Schaufelberger (2000) identified marketing as one of the most
important functions of organizations working in the field
of housing development. The need to develop marketing
strategies (Dale et al., 2012; Wang & Liu, 2013; Zeng et al.,
2015; Liang & Gao, 2018) in the field of housing development has become increasingly important in the last few
decades.
Market research also plays an important role in housing development (Cariaga & El-Diraby, 2013; Zhou et al.,
2015). For housing developers, it is a necessary part of
their development strategies. Over the last few decades,
decisions in the field of housing development have been

based on personal surveys, experiments, focus group research, aimed at identifying the needs and attitudes of the
target audience (Stanton et al., 2017; McDowell & Dick,
2013; Brenninkmeijer et al., 2020). The effectiveness of
these traditional market techniques is becoming increasingly questionable, as in many cases people do not understand and cannot explain their behavior. This phenomenon is caused by the unconscious performance of most
activities. According to Agarwal and Dutta (2015), more
than 90 percent of mental activity is performed unconsciously and traditional research methods are not suitable
for its evaluation. The growing use of neurotechnologies
and neuroimaging techniques have influenced the field of
market research significantly, particularly in the last decade. In addition to traditional market research methods
based on verbal response, there has been an increasing
application and development of neuroscience techniques,
which allow for an objective assessment of what processes
take place in the human brain.
For a long time, the home buyer was seen as a rational
decision-maker whose behavior can be explained by traditional market research. This approach was quite conveni-

ent: rational behavior could be assessed and measured.
As consumer behavior becomes increasingly difficult to
explain, it is now recognized, that behavior is not based
solely on consciousness and rationality. In addition, consumers themselves often do not know and cannot explain
why they have made one decision or another. Under these
conditions, traditional market research no longer meets
the needs of the modern housing market. As emotions
play an increasingly important role in the decision-making process (Ruževičiūtė, 2012), the application of neuroscience methods becomes expedient.
Neuromarketing is a new interdisciplinary field of
research, transcending the boundaries of neuroscience,
neuroeconomics, and marketing research (Ulman et al.,
2015). By combining the views and efforts of representatives of individual schools of scientific thought, an innovative approach to the consumer is formed, and marketing strategies based on the movement of nerve impulses
and emotions are developed. Neuromarketing opens up
vast new sources of data, opportunities to expand theoretical assumptions, and to visualize cognitive decisionmaking processes (Shealy & Hu, 2018). Relatively recent
neuromarketing techniques presuppose a fundamentally
different way to quantify human behavior during the
decision-making process. The use of techniques such as
electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance
imaging, and eye capture enables the collection of data on
neurological responses in the human brain.
Neuroscience techniques in making marketing decisions are applied in a variety of sectors: telecommunications (Adhami, 2013), nutrition (Tichy et al., 2012; Cosic,
2016), cosmetics (Costa et al., 2015), and other sectors.
Neuro techniques have been applied to engineering decision making (Hu et al., 2018; Shealy & Hu, 2018; Hu
& Shealy, 2019). Neuroscience and its techniques are also
likely to have huge untapped potential in the field of housing development, so this article aims to uncover the potential of neuroscience in this sector. To this end, the concept and development of neuromarketing is first revealed,
followed by a description of neuroscience techniques and
the identification of their applications.

1. Development and concept of neuromarketing
Neuroscience is a discipline, aimed at analyzing human
thoughts, emotions, and behavior, and is a relatively new
concept of classical cognitive science, which began to
take shape in the middle of the 20th century. Neuroscience itself, as a means of explaining consumer behavior,
was introduced in business practice much later, only about
a few decades ago, when terms such as neuroeconomics
and neuromarketing appeared (Ruževičiūtė, 2012). These
terms have come to be used as synonyms, but the aims
and nature of the concepts of neuroeconomics and neuromarketing differ. Neuromarketing is a sub-discipline of
neuroeconomics (Hubert & Kenning, 2008).
The term ‘neuromarketing’ was proposed by Smidts
in 2002 (Levallois et al., 2019). Since then, the focus of
researchers and international organizations on neuromarketing has increased. As noted by Ulman and colleagues
(2015), the number of publications examining neuromarketing as an object of research during the period between
2000–2010 increased from 10 to 250 over the period, and
more than 300 market research companies were working
in the field of neuromarketing research in 2015 (Ulman
et al., 2015).
Ulman et al. (2015) proposes to classify the neuromarketing studies conducted so far by directions. The authors
identified two directions: consumer neuroscience and the
direct application of neuroimaging techniques to achieve
sector-specific goals. Both directions of research are interrelated. These trends have also led to a rather wide variety
of definitions of neuromarketing (Table 1).
In summary, the content of the neuromarketing concept has expanded over the last few decades. While at the
beginning of the twentieth century neuromarketing was
treated as an application of neuroscience methods, recent
viewpoint on it has been much broader: neuromarketing
is already considered an interdisciplinary field of science.
Neuroscience methods can also be applied to housing development.

1.1. Neuroscience techniques applicable
to housing development
Neuroscience techniques provide the preconditions for
identifying what is being focused at and evaluate sensory experiences. These techniques assess memory and
the learning process. Probably the most important things
neuroscience techniques determine are emotions and
motivation (Cosic, 2016). For this purpose, neuroscience
techniques fall into the following three groups:
1. Momentary techniques for measuring changes in
electronic neuronal activity;
2. Techniques for measuring changes in metabolic
neuronal activity;
3. Techniques for measuring changes in psychological
response to a stimulus.
The scientific potential of neuroscience technicians
is quite high, but attempts to apply them in the field of
housing development are quite minimal. Therefore, some
neuroscience techniques are discussed in detail, which
have not necessarily been applied in the field of housing
development, but can potentially be applied in decisions
related to the sale of housing.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a technique where
electrodes are placed on the outside of the skull. In this
way, the electrical activity of neurons is measured. Jebelli
et al. (2017) describe electroencephalography as a noninvasive method of medical imaging to collect data on
electrical activity in the brain. Electroencephalography
was first tested in 1875 by R. Caton in an experiment on
monkeys and rabbits. The first experiments on humans
were performed in 1924 (Harris et al., 2018). According
to Costa et al. (2015), electroencephalography is a noninvasive procedure, which can be applied to both adults
and children. The application of this technique creates
preconditions for measuring brain activity.
There are two main sources for electroencephalographic measurements. The first is an electrocorrigram, which
is measured directly in the cortex (on the surface of the
scalp in a non-invasive manner). The second source is an
electrogram used for electroencephalographic measurements by inserting a depth probe directly into brain tissue.
Electrograms are only applicable in clinical trials (Jebelli
et al., 2017). For this reason, it can be argued, that only
electrocorrigrams are suitable as data sources in the housing development sector. Electrograms, as a data source,
track voltage fluctuations caused by the activity of neurons
on the surface of the brain. In order to collect data on voltage fluctuations, it is advisable to use several electrodes. It
should be noted, electroencephalographic data are highly
dependent on the location of the electrodes. For example,
the cerebral cortex field has the greatest effect on electrical activity. Each part of the cerebral cortex field (anterior
lobe, locomotor lobe, parietal lobe, etc.) controls different
functions. For example, the anterior lobe is responsible
for emotions and the ability to concentrate. The locomotor lobe is important in controlling voluntary movements
(Jebelli et al., 2017).

17
Electroencephalography is usually characterized by
rhythmic activity. Rhythmic activities are generally classified into five main wave groups, depending on differences
in frequency ranges:
– delta (0.5–4 Hz);
– theta (4–8 Hz);
– alpha (8–13 Hz);
– beta (13–30 Hz);
– gamma (<30 Hz) (Jebelli et al., 2017).
Delta and theta frequency ranges are most common
in infants, children, and sleeping adults. Alpha frequency
ranges are associated with conscious thinking, unconscious thoughts, promoting deep relaxation. The beta frequency range is a normal gait rhythm associated with active thinking and concentration. The beta frequency range
can clearly show brain activity in the brain motion section.
The gamma frequency range has a very low amplitude, so
the gamma frequency range is quite rarely found in adults.
The gamma frequency range is common in clinical cases
where certain brain disorders occur (Jebelli et al., 2017).
Electroencephalogram is one of the most widely used
biometric research tools, as it provides a prerequisite for
collecting data on both emotional valence and excitation
(Ergan et al., 2019). The electroencephalography method
has been successfully applied in the study of various aspects of a person’s psychology, such as stress, emotional
exhaustion, burnout, and mental fatigue. For a long time,
electroencephalography was applied only in a laboratory
environment using a clinical electroencephalography recording device (such as an electrode cap) and not in real
workplaces. The use of this method in real housing construction sites has long been limited by the fact, that the
electroencephalography recording device is connected by
wires, limiting the uninterrupted work of construction
workers. The emergence of modern electroencephalography devices allowing physical movement, has made it possible to apply the method without physical disturbances
or wires, quite simply, and without incurring significant
financial costs (Jebelli et al., 2017).
Electroencephalographic signals are classified into two
main groups: external and internal. External sounds are
emitted by the environment (ambient noise, body movement sounds) or by the electroencephalography device
itself (electrode movements, wiring system sounds). Internal sounds are heard due to the psychological activities
of the body. Electroencephalographic signals are very sensitive to noise of various forms and sources. The quality
of electroencephalographic signals is quite low in noisy
environments such as construction sites. To eliminate
this problem, Jebelli et al. (2018) proposed and validated
a signal processing model, enabling the elimination of the
sounds of the most common tools and equipment at construction sites.
The popularity of electroencephalography is due to its
low application cost and the ability to apply the technique
to small samples, which is quite practical (Cosic, 2016).
This technique can be applied in a natural and comfort-

able environment (Hu et al., 2018). Electroencephalography is characterized by excellent temporary resolution
because this method is not based on blood flow. Electroencephalography captures the electrical activity of neurons
caused by ions and neurons. Another important advantage
of electroencephalography is this method’s ability to accurately monitor neuronal activity and brain wave structure
by directly reaching the central nervous system (Jebelli
et al., 2017). The main disadvantage of electroencephalography is poor spatial resolution, as it is difficult to detect
specific neuronal sites. Moreover, the method does not
make it possible to distinguish cognitive activation from
other parts of the brain involved in the mental process
(Hu & Shealy, 2019). It should also be noted, that the application of electroencephalography requires some preparation of the scalp skin (hair removal and coating with a
conductive gel), which may be completely impractical in
housing construction sites (Jebelli et al., 2017).
Electroencephalography technique has been used to
determine the level of stress in construction workers (Jebelli et al., 2018) and to assess work safety (Awolusi et al.,
2019). The samples of electroencephalographic examinations are quite small, usually from 5 to 8 study participants
(Table 2). This method uses an Emotiv EPOC +, electroencephalography device, or other equipment is worn.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging. This is the
most popular data collection method in neuroscience
(Grigaliūnaitė & Pilelienė, 2016). It is an indirect inflow
of oxygen-filled blood to the active side of the brain. Magnetic and radio waves are used to create images in the
brain (Cosic, 2016). Using functional magnetic resonance
imaging, brain activity is assessed by recording changes
in oxygen-saturated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb), oxygen-unsaturated hemoglobin (deoxy-HB), and total hemoglobin
(HBT). Changes in hemoglobin or blood flow indicate
activation of neurons (Hu & Shealy, 2019). The functional
magnetic resonance technique can be illustrated by an example. Suppose when a participant views a communication message, then light activates the lenses and pupils of
both eyes, as well as about 125 million optic nerve receptors. Nerve impulses are transmitted to the intermediate
brain. The brain focuses the pupils and coordinates eye
movements in the field of the communication message.
Other signals are transmitted by the pupils and lenses
through nerve fibers and then reach the brain. The right
part of the communication message is transmitted to the
left and the left part to the right hemisphere. The left and

right hemispheres of the brain are responsible for different activities. By taking the principles of brain functioning
into account, organizations have the opportunity to create
such communication messages, which are likely to enter
the part of the brain that is most compatible with the nature of the product (Grigaliūnaitė & Pilelienė, 2016). The
functional magnetic resonance technique is characterized
by a wide spatial resolution, but the mobility and temporal
resolution of the participants are limited (Hu et al., 2018;
Hu & Shealy, 2019). To date, this approach has hardly
been applied to housing development decision-making.
Functional near-infrared spectroscopy, fNIRS. Performed by wearing a special head cover. In this cover, light
is emitted from the sources to the scalp at specific wavelengths of 700 to 900 nm. Hemoglobin and deoxygenated
hemoglobin in the blood absorb more light than water and
other tissues in the brain. An increase in hemoglobin in
the brain is associated with an increase in cognitive activity. Unabsorbed light is reflected back to the detectors in
the headgear and thus changes in cognitive activity can be
measured. The different spectra of hemoglobin absorption
make it possible to characterize the activated parts of the
brain and cognitive activities through changes in hemoglobin concentration. An important advantage of this
method is the ability to apply in a natural and comfortable environment. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy
has better spatial resolution than electroencephalography
and better temporary resolution than functional magnetic
resonance imaging. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy is widespread in experiments with decision making in
conditions of risk and uncertainty (Hu et al., 2018).
Eye tracking – it is the recording of a person’s eye
movements to determine where the person is looking at
a particular point in time and in what order his/her eyes
are moving from one place to another. Capturing the gaze
of individuals creates preconditions for gaining insights
about the distribution of attention, visual search strategies, cognitive processes. All this is organized and prioritized in the brain, and later reflected in behavior. Given
a person’s gaze correlates with attention, it can be argued,
that the gaze capture technique creates the preconditions
for researchers to assess a subject’s attention distribution.
In addition, with the help of gaze capture, it is possible to
examine a person’s awareness, perception, fatigue, cognitive processes. Based on the collected data, it is possible
to make assumptions about the behavior of the observed
person in the future. To this end, gaze capture technol-

ogy evaluates the influence of an independent variable, the
stimulus, on dependent variables (eye movement indicators) (Hasanzadeh et al., 2016, 2018).
This is a very popular neuroscience technique in market research. It is used not only in market research but
also in disciplines such as software design, website design,
psychology, human behavior research, game design (Mohammadpour et al., 2015; Habibnezhad et al., 2016). The
use of eye capture techniques to identify risks to construction workers in housing development is quite common
(Habibnezhad et al., 2016; Hasanzadeh et al., 2016, 2018).
The popularity of this technique is probably due to the
fact, that the subjects do not feel it, do not notice it, and
their time is not wasted. On the other hand, this raises
ethical dilemmas regarding informing participants about
their participation in the market research. Often, the eye
capture technique is combined with electroencephalography (Cosic, 2016). Attention should also be paid to the
fact, that eye capture equipment is usually expensive,
specific skills and knowledge are required to operate it.
There is a lack of convenient, portable equipment with
real-time data processing capabilities (Hasanzadeh et al.,
2016). Over time, this equipment becomes more and more
user-friendly, more cost-effective. As Mohammadpour
et al. (2015) note, due to the different area of ​​the eyeball,
shapes, wearing glasses, which change the size of the eye,
it is necessary to calibrate the eye capture equipment for
each study participant. For the calibration procedure, the
participant is asked to sit and relax in front of the eye capture chamber. The study participant is asked not to move.
The participant then looks at the 9 calibration locations
on the screen.
The eye capture technique uses mobile glasses or a stationary device with infrared cameras to determine where
a person is directing their gaze (Tichy et al., 2012). According to Hasanzadeh et al. (2018), near-infrared technology and high-resolution cameras are required to track
the direction of corneal reflection and gaze. According to
the authors, this technology enables researchers to continuously observe the points of view on a 2D screen or
in a 3D environment. Eye capture can be remote (during
the experiment, the subject sits in front of the screen) and
mobile (during the experiment, the subject is allowed to
move freely).
Fixation and movement are measured using gaze tracking techniques. Fixation is marked when the user’s gaze is
relatively immobile at a specific location, and movement
is defined by rapid movement of the gaze from fixations to
other elements (Mohammadpour et al., 2015). Hasanzadeh
et al. (2018) also recommend examining fixations (maintaining a relatively static eye position for 100–200 ms)
and movement (sudden eye movement between fixation
points). And although at first glance Mohammadpour
et al. (2015) and Hasanzadeh et al. (2018) offer similar
indicators, however, as detailed examination shows, the
content of one of these indicators, specifically movement,
is different. According to Mohammadpour et al. (2015),
motion is measured as the movement of the gaze from

19
fixation to other elements, while Hasanzadeh et al. (2018)
measure motion between fixation points. Habibnezhad
et al. (2016) propose to evaluate the following indicators
using the gaze capture technique:
– percentage of stopping time. The proportion of gaze
stop time from the total stimulus demonstration
time;
– duration of the first fixation. Duration of the study
participant’s first gaze fixation on the stimulus;
– percentage of fixation. Proportion of the number of
fixations from all fixations during stimulus demonstration.
According to Tichy et al. (2012), the result of this
method is a map with ‘hotspots’ showing where the gaze is
most often directed. Mohammadpour et al. (2015) specify,
that eye capture software (such as Mirametrix S2) collects
eye position data depending on the interest and aggregated gaze fixations, displayed on the hotspot map. The
‘hot spots’ map is described by Hasanzadeh et al. (2018) as
a 2D visualization in which all analyzed capture values are
represented on color scales. Hotspot maps can be created
for each study participant individually or for the entire
study sample. This type of visualization provides useful
generalized information. In addition to hotspot maps,
eye movement paths are commonly used. The path of eye
movement is a spatial representation of the movementcapture-movement of the gaze. The optimal path of movement is a straight line depicting the movement of the eye
between the desired points. Because the path of movement
shows the course of movement in the observed space, this
result provides more important information than visualizations of fixation sites.
In eye-tracking studies to ensure 90 percent. reliability
of the results, at least 20–30 participants would be needed
(Grigaliūnaitė & Pilelienė, 2016). In research using gaze
capture techniques, the number of participants ranges
from 8 to 27 (Table 3). In housing development studies using gaze capture techniques, various indicators have been
measured showing gaze capture and movement.
Galvanic skin response. It is a biometric assessment,
measuring a widely used measure called skin conductivity. Galvanic skin reactions are used to collect data
on the amount of sweat released from the skin. These
amounts are directly correlated with the strength of emotional arousal. When people face emotional events (such
as stress, pleasure) in their daily lives, their sweat levels
increase. As sweat levels increase, so do skin conduction
reactions.
In some cases, different neuroscience techniques are
combined together. Ergan et al. (2019) used the following
techniques to evaluate human experience in architectural
spaces. Which integrate virtual reality and body sensor
networks: electroencephalogram to measure human brain
electrical activity, galvanic skin reactions to measure skin
electrical conductivity, facial or visual electromyography
to determine facial expressions; eye capture to assess human eye movement in space and a photoplethysogram to
measure changes in heart rate.

After analyzing the techniques of electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance, functional nearinfrared spectroscopy, gaze capture, the advantages and
disadvantages of each of these techniques can be refined
(Table 4).
An analysis of neuroscience techniques and advantages shows functional semi-infrared spectroscopy and galvanic skin reactions to have the weakest limitations, but
this does not reveal the advantage of these techniques over
other neuroscience techniques. It should be noted, in each
case, the most appropriate technique should be selected
depending on the purpose of the study, the context of the
study, the available human, financial and time resources.

1.2. Potential of application of neuroscience
techniques for housing sector development
The potential for the use of neuroscience techniques in
housing development is quite wide. One of the applications
of neuroscience – selection of the most appropriate incentives for the distribution of the product (in this case, housing as a good or a related service) for maximum consumer
impact (Costa et al., 2015; Cosic, 2016; Grigaliūnaitė &
Pilelienė, 2016). Traditional communication campaigns
are characterized by large amounts of visual information,
almost always supplemented by audio elements. Such traditional communication in today’s changing environment
often becomes incapable, insufficient and inappropriate

Fixation, movement

for the communication message to reach the consumer.
Therefore, it is only natural for some of the information to
be simply ignored by the user. In order to increase brand
recognition and strengthen consumer relations with the
brand, Grigaliūnaitė and Pilelienė (2016) recommends
ensuring a positive synergy of all five senses.
The application of neurosciences creates preconditions
for the organization to determine the quantitative characteristics of the repetition of a communication message. Using neuroscience techniques, it is calculated how often it
is appropriate to repeat a particular communication message in a specific communication channel (Grigaliūnaitė &
Pilelienė, 2016). Kaklauskas et al. (2019, 2020) have proved
that neuromarketing provides huge benefits in choosing
appropriate marketing communication. For that purpose
authors have developed VINERS method that leads to the
selection of a rational video advertisement for the target
market segment. Cosic (2016) also confirms the potential
of neuroscience in the area of marketing communication.
Another important area of application for the neurosciences is product development. An organization can
learn what sensory stimuli embedded in product development would cause user satisfaction through neuroscience research (Mohammadpour et al., 2015; Grigaliūnaitė
& Pilelienė, 2016). Tichy et al. (2012), Cosic (2016) recommend the application of neuroscience techniques in
product design tests.

The importance of involving the end user in the design
process of housing and construction projects has recently
been recognized. End users are those who will later live or
work in the building. Even if these individuals do not have
sufficient knowledge in housing management, they may
have strong and reasoned opinions about the expected
outcome. In order to involve end users in the design process, methods such as focus groups, working groups, and
questionnaires are used. Despite the importance of these
methods and the important contribution they make to understanding consumers and their needs, the application
of these methods requires a considerable amount of time
and effort, both in collecting and interpreting respondents’
responses. For this reason, information and communication technologies are included in the cognitive processes
of consumers and their needs. One of the methods proposed for this purpose is eye capture (Mohammadpour
et al., 2015).
Vartanian et al. (2015) used brain science techniques
to study brain activity in relation to housing. Using neu-

ral imaging techniques, the authors found rooms with
higher ceilings to be rated as more attractive compared to
those with low ceilings. These assessments are related to
activities in individual parts of the brain. Such insights can
be useful in choosing the height of the ceiling in rooms,
buildings. The neuroscience technique, and more specifically eye capture, was also used by Mohammadpour et al.
(2015) to select housing design solutions. With the help
of eye capture, home builders and developers can ensure
the final result of the project will meet the needs of the
home buyer. Mohammadpour et al. (2015) formulated the
hypothesis of customer satisfaction with different design
variations being related to their visual attention. In other
words, more customer-friendly design alternatives are
receiving more attention. The authors conducted an experiment using gaze tracking techniques to evaluate four
facade design alternatives depicted in a 3D environment.
Study participants were asked to rate their level of satisfaction with each alternative, and their interaction with
each virtual model was measured using eye fixation. The

results of the study conducted by the authors showed, that
study participants do not necessarily look longer at the
alternative which seems more attractive. Such research results are explained by the fact of more attention being paid
not only to the alternative with which the participants are
more satisfied, but also to the alternative with the lowest
satisfaction. Moreover, focusing does not necessarily have
to be equated with satisfaction. It was found, that more
research participants were attracted by the design alternatives, which are dominated by warm colors, but more
attention was also paid to the geometry and materials of
the buildings.
Neuroscience techniques are also applied in selecting
a product-specific pricing strategy. Different pricing solutions are appropriate for different categories of products.
The neuromarketing paradigm helps to clarify the differences between such solutions. For example, the price of a
daily consumer product is very different in nature from
the price of a branded product. This is confirmed by the
change in the location of brain activity, assessing prices
together with associations (Pilelienė, 2012).
As the analysis of neuroscience applications shows,
the applications of neuroscience techniques have a broad
spectrum. And while the spectrum is wide, none of the
areas are inseparable from at least one element of the
marketing complex. Therefore, all the discussed areas of
application of neurosciences are divided according to the
elements of the marketing complex (Table 5).
As the analysis has shown, neuroscience techniques
can involve the fulfillment of each element of the marketing complex. This performance may vary depending
on the organizational context and, more specifically, the
sector in which the organization operates. One of the sectors, which is characterized by the specific expression of
neuroscience applications, is the field of housing development. In the beginning of the 21st century, Schaufelberger
(2000) highlighted the transformation inherent in building marketing, involving increasingly more marketers,
who were savvy and professional. Human capital, able to
select the most appropriate neuroscience technicians in a
particular case and apply them effectively, is becoming a
very valuable factor in creating a competitive advantage in
housing development.

It is clear, neuroscience has great potential for application in housing development. In realizing this potential,
it is important to pay attention to potential challenges as
well. For example, Ulman et al. (2015), Mileti et al. (2016),
Stanton et al. (2017) draw attention to ethical issues in the
use of neuroscience. According to the authors, ethical dilemmas are receiving more and more attention in the light
of the expanding neuroscience research market. As the authors note, year 2015 data show there were more than 300
neuromarketing research companies worldwide (Ulman
et al., 2015). It is important for neuroscience technologies to be publicized and used in human behavior research
without violating ethical principles and legal requirements
in the areas of human rights and dignity (Ulman et al.,
2015; Cosic, 2016).
Summarizing neuroscience research, neuroscience
techniques are divided into three groups of different content: 1) instantaneous techniques for measuring changes
in electronic neuronal activity; 2) techniques for measuring changes in metabolic neuronal activity; 3) techniques
for measuring changes in the psychological response to a
marketing stimulus. After the analysis of separate groups
belonging to these neuroscience techniques, it was found,
that electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance, eye capture, all have great potential for application
in the field of housing development. These and other techniques are used to make marketing decisions related to
individual elements of the marketing complex.

Conclusions
1. In the field of housing development, in order to
improve the sale of housing by better responding
to the needs of potential buyers, the transferable
and adaptable solutions from other areas are gaining more and more weight. Neuroscience has been
used for some time for the development of housing
as an object, demonstrating the strengthening of interdisciplinarity, among other measures to improve
sales. After systematizing the knowledge about the
most commonly presented interpretations of the
concepts of neuromarketing, the scientific knowledge of this field was supplemented and the defini-

tion of neuromarketing was clarified. It was found,
that the concept of neuromarketing has expanded
from the application of neuroscience methods to an
interdisciplinary field of science. Neuromarketing
and its techniques create preconditions for paying
attention to the emotions of potential home buyers,
their emotional states, which can be considered as
a basis for setting consumer needs and priorities.
2. After analyzing the latest research in the field of
neuroscience, the main groups of neuroscience
techniques are classified (momentary techniques
for measuring changes in electronic neuronal activity, techniques for measuring changes in metabolic
neuronal activity, techniques for measuring changes
in psychological response to stimuli). A detailed review of the techniques of electroencephalography,
functional magnetic resonance, functional near-infrared spectroscopy, eye capture and galvanic skin
reaction, identification of advantages and limitations has shown, that these techniques are not ideal
for every case. The choice of specific techniques in
each case is determined by the purpose of the research, the context, and the available financial, human and time resources.
3. It has been established, that in the field of housing
development, neuroscience techniques can be used
to make marketing decisions related to individual
elements of the marketing complex (product, price,
distribution, sponsorship), working with target audiences of different ages, life experiences, characteristics who want to live where they feel themselves
best. In the future it is essential to analyse specifics
of empirical researches of neuromarketing in the
field of housing development.
4. In order to confirm the suitability of neuroscience
techniques in the field of housing development, in
the future, empirical research is needed to enable
the selection and substantiation of the most appropriate housing marketing solutions. This could
simplify the process of advertising homes for sale,
improve the quality of videos and make them more
interesting and effective.
