Abstract: As the necessity for safety and aesthetic of nightscape have arisen, the importance
of nightscapes (i.e., nighttime landscape) planning has garnered the attention of mainstream
consciousness. Therefore, this study was to suggest the guideline for nightscape planning
using electroencephalography (EEG) technology and survey for recognizing the characteristics
of a nightscape. Furthermore, we verified the electroencephalography (EEG) method as a tool for
landscape evaluation. Therefore, this study analyzed the change of relative alpha wave and relative
beta wave and perceived fear of participants depending on twelve nightscape settings (four types of
settings: Built nightscape images group with an adult; Built nightscape images groups without an
adult; Nature-dominant nightscape images with an adult; and Nature-dominant nightscape images
without an adult). Our findings indicate that the most fearful nightscape setting was recorded in Built
nightscape images groups without an adult figure in perceived fear result depending on four types of
nightscape settings. In Nature-dominant nightscape images, on the other hand, the nightscape setting
with an adult figure was more fearful than the setting without an adult. The interaction effect between
landscape type (built and nature-dominant) and adult presence towards perceived fear was verified
and it showed that the image with adult affects landscape type. For electroencephalography (EEG)
results, several brain activities in the relative alpha and beta wave showed significant differences
depending on nightscape settings, which situates electroencephalography (EEG) as an invaluable tool
for evaluating landscapes. Based on our physiological electroencephalography (EEG) experiment,
we provide a new analytic view of the nightscape. The approach we utilized enables a deeper
understanding of emotional perception and fear among human subjects by identifying the physical
environment which impacts how they experience nightscapes.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background
As the necessity for safety and aesthetic of nightscape have arisen, the importance of nightscapes
(i.e., nighttime landscape) planning has garnered the attention of mainstream consciousness. Many
local governments are recognizing that well-designed nightscapes can enhance the image of a city
and subsequently attract more residents, investors, and tourists. From an urban planning point of
view, there is difficulty reconciling conflicts and interests between producers of light (beneficiary) and
consumers, to draw consensus of the community, and to reflect these in light pollution standards
and management systems. In this context, research on nightscape planning has been carried out in

terms of night pollution [1,2], tourism development [3], safety issues [4], etc. However, the preceding
studies have mostly focused on a particular structure to conduct a field survey rather than on empirical
data [5]. Experimental data of nightscape are significant for human health as excessive lighting can
cause fatigue, serious illness such as cancer, and accidents [6].
Experiential data reflect the psychological elements of the participants. Since more than 70% of
information is obtained through visual sense in human’s five representative senses (sight, hearing,
touch, smell, and taste), many studies [7,8] have been conducted to analyze emotions aroused from
visual stimuli. Therefore, it is important to study psychological aspects among the effects of lighting on
the human body, such as concentration, nervousness, and fear [9]. This study validated the relationship
between nighttime environments and fear as one of the affective responses to nightscape. We examined
participants’ reported levels of fear that directly correspond to the interaction of lighting positions and
the presence of specific physical elements in the landscape.
In this study, we developed a new method of analyzing nightscape using Mobile
electroencephalography (EEG), which is directly related to people’s perception of the environment.
The existing studies do not directly evaluate the EEG response to nightscape in combination with
a survey analysis to assess human perception. Recent laboratory-based neuroimaging studies indicate
that various environments may be associated with characteristic patterns of brain activity [10–12]. Mobile
EEG provides a non-invasive way to capture emotional states of human research subjects. Furthermore,
research that utilizes Mobile EEG requires rigorously controlled experiments and complex analytical
tools. Mobile EEG is increasingly being used beyond the clinical and experimental environments; it is
now frequently used to monitor brain function and cognition in real life situations [13]. A unique aspect
of Mobile EEG is its ability to gather the participants’ response data on a second-by-second timescale with
virtually no interruptions [14]. Recent Mobile EEG research shows how people can evaluate, visualize,
explore, and develop a spatial perception of architectural designs [15].
The purpose of this study was to suggest guideline for nightscape planning using EEG technology
and survey for recognized characteristics of a nightscape. Furthermore, we verified the EEG method
as a tool for landscape evaluation. We used survey methods to investigate participants’ subjective
perception of fear level to help interpret EEG data in a real-world setting by using mobile EEG
apparatus. While EEG output provides a real-time psychophysiological measurement of response to
changing environments, self-reporting of fear provides a context and understanding of these changes.
1.2. Studies on Nightscape and Desirable Landscape Types for Nightscape Studies
Several previous studies on landscape perception have been associated with measuring how
people perceive specific surrounding environmental settings during the daytime. Most of these studies
have derived design guidelines following their findings. Nighttime design guidelines, however,
for a particular environmental setting have not been as well developed as nightscape perception
research. Lee et al. [16] analyzed subjective characteristics of light in nightscapes and studied the
relationship between lighting design and people’s perceptions of nightscapes. Ahn et al. [17] attempted
to evaluate nightscapes by identifying variables that affect people’s perception of nighttime streetscapes.
Park et al. [18] studied the maintenance and improvement of nightscapes through field surveys. Most
of these studies use qualitative methods.
Research has discussed the interplay between landscape types and the physiological response of
human beings [19]; it is very critical to divide landscape types in landscape evaluation studies. It is
common to divide by dichotomy, e.g., natural versus built landscape, in existing studies [14,15,20–22],
but there have been various ways to divide landscape types in previous studies. Ulrich et al. [23]
divided landscape types into six: plant environment including trees and other vegetation; water
environment, primarily flowing water and that which involved trees; congested traffic; normal traffic;
crowded pedestrian environment; and common pedestrian environment. Chang et al. [10] divided
landscape types more specifically depending on the wildness level: extensive landscape such as
mountain, small landscape such as Japanese gardens, and abstract landscape such as a view from

Sustainability 2019, 11, 233

window. Similarly, landscapes from daytime can be divided in various ways, because people can
perceive their detailed differences. However, landscape type from nighttime (nightscape) should be
differently considered when it comes to arousing fear and its observability. Fisher and Nasar [24]
argued that daytime environments such as tree can increase fear at night because it provides
concealment, limited prospects, and blocked escape routes. Moreover, the detailed landscape types in
landscape evaluation research make it difficult for people to distinguish landscapes.
Therefore, the specific landscape types in this study were divided into natural and built landscape
including buildings, low free-standing walls, tall and short trees, and shrubs. Since there were few
nightscape scenes without any built elements, we set the images including mostly natural elements as
Nature-dominant nightscape. Additionally, we investigated the effects of the presence of a human figure
in a nightscape, because the presence of a stranger in a nighttime landscape is suspected to elicit fear.
1.3. Studies on EEG
EEG has been used as a tool to supplement surveys or experts’ opinion that have been commonly
utilized in landscape evaluation field. Recent studies using neuroimaging methods in environmental
psychology have shown that different types of urban environments interact differently with varying
environments in relation to the distinctive patterns of brain activity [14]. Existing studies using EEG in
this way have explored how people perceive different environment settings, and these studies [10,14,15]
mainly compare the natural landscape versus built landscape among various settings (see details in
Table 1). For example, Roe et al. [15] investigated EEG how the brain engages with natural versus urban
setting, suggesting that natural based landscapes are associated with greater levels of meditation and
lower arousal than urban scenes. Tilley et al. [14] measured the level of excitement, engagement, and
frustration using EEG depending on specific urban and natural settings (eight types of environmental
settings). Tilley et al. also proposed a detailed design implication that compares EEG results with
different settings.
As presented above, differences in perceived color [25], fractal pattern [26], and biodiversity [27,28]
as well as differences in brain activities by landscape type have been discussed.
Kim and Lee [25] used EEG to derive a design implication that alpha wave can be used to create
a peaceful space for alpha sound and to create lively spaces using beta waves. Here, the various
brain wave such as alpha and beta wave are used to evaluate brain activity by proxy measurements.
The measurement of brain activity can be divided into four types in general: delta (<4 Hz) features
slow and loud brainwaves and is generated in deepest meditation and dreamless sleep; theta (4–7 Hz)
occurs most often in light sleep or extreme relaxation; alpha (8–13 Hz) is dominant during quietly
flowing thoughts and in some meditative states; and beta (14–30 Hz), which dominates our normal
waking state of consciousness when attention, is directed towards cognitive tasks [29].
As the recent EEG technology develops, the use of mobile EEG has been widespread in
related studies, and new approaches combining different methodologies such as eye tracking [30],
electromyography and blood volume pulse [10], and in-depth interview [14] with EEG are also
increasing to validate EEG’s effectiveness. In addition to EEG technology, fMRI (functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging), another technology for measuring brain activity, has been used to compare
landscape characteristics in other studies [19,31]. Kim et al. [31] used functional MRI in response
to viewing rural and urban living environment, which suggested an inherent preference toward
nature-friendly environment. Tang et al. [19] compared the restorative value of four types of landscape
environments (urban, mountain, forest, and water) using questionnaires and fMRI as well, and found
the water type was the most restorative environment among other stimuli.
Many EEG studies in aspects of environment have engaged with showing generally beneficial
effects of green spaces or specific colors and environments in deriving preference or restorative
effects from natural landscape. However, there is no research regarding its beneficial effect on
nightscape. Accordingly, this study used EEG to evaluate nightscapes related with its fear and

3.2.2. Comparison between Groups for EEG on Relative Beta Wave (unit: mV)
For beta wave, one-way ANOVA between four groups (BNIG/wo, BNIG/w, NNIG/wo, and
NNIG/w) was performed because the interaction effect between landscape type and adult presence
toward beta wave was not significant similar to the alpha wave result.
The mean and standard deviation of the relative beta wave by eight EEG areas are shown in
Table 7. We focused on the difference between before and after an adult appearance by two different
landscape settings. The results of BNIG showed most alpha wave ratio increased in Fp1 (0.59→0.66),
Fp2 (0.66→0.68), F3 (0.36→0.37), F4 (0.38→0.43), O1 (0.30→0.33), and O2 (0.29→0.31) except for C3
(0.27→0.23) and C4 (0.24→0.23) after seeing figure including adult. The ratio of NNIG increased
over the whole electrode areas (Fp1 (0.58→0.72), Fp2 (0.57→0.71), F3 (0.34→0.39), F4 (0.33→0.42), C3
(0.17→0.23), C4 (0.14→0.21), O1 (0.27→0.28), and O2 (0.27→0.30)) after an adult appearance.
The result of ANOVA for beta wave by each electrode is depicted in Table 8. Unlike alpha wave’s
ANOVA test, statistical significance was relatively low. For Fp1, Fp2, C3 and C4, there was significant
difference depending on landscape types. The detailed results of the post hoc are as follows.

Figure 7 shows the general comparison depending on four landscape settings by brain wave
(alpha and beta waves). In alpha wave, the dispersion between eight electrodes was relatively smaller
than the beta wave. NNIG/wo in alpha wave has the highest value, and overall NNIG value is higher
than beta wave. On the other hand, the comparison of beta wave depending landscape types shows
that the appearance of an adult tended to be more influential than the landscape element (i.e., natural

4. Discussion
4.1. Perceived Fear Differences Depending on Settings and Usability of EEG in Landscape Evaluation
This study analyzed the relationship between EEG and fear dependent upon various nightscape
settings. We analyzed the relative alpha and beta waves depending on four types of nightscape settings
including interpreting recorded fear on each nightscape settings from 40 participants. We focused not
only on different settings depending on landscape type (BNIG and NNIG) and adult presence, but
also the interaction between these two factors. In EEG part, the reasons we used the relative alpha and
beta waves among various types of EEG wave was that alpha is known to occur when one is feeling
stable and relaxed while beta is known to occur when one is concentrating. Therefore, it was assumed
that there would be a negative relationship between fear and alpha wave and positive relationship
between fear and beta wave. We also assumed that the alpha and beta waves would vary depending
on the presence of an adult in each nightscape setting. The results of this study are summarized as
follows and the three hypotheses we set were all verified.
First, our results show that the most fearful nightscape setting was recorded in BNIG without
the adult figure when comparing self-recorded fear depending on four types of nightscape settings.
In NNIG, on the other hand, the nightscape setting with adult figure was more fearful than the
nightscape setting without adult. The critical part of the perceived fear difference depending on
settings is the significant interaction between landscape type and adult presence, which are two main
independent variables towards perceived fear. That is, adult presence in landscape settings can affect
perceived fear. Specifically, the difference between built nightscape and nature-oriented nightscape
was evident in images without adult. When people perceive nightscape, it is understood that adult
presence make people disperse their gaze, which further implies the importance of setting conditions
in the landscape evaluation.
Second, overall EEG wave (eight brain areas in alpha and beta waves) was affected by not only
nightscape type, but also the presence of an adult. Especially, the EEG response in frontal lobes, which
is related to the cognitive function, showed a significant relationship between the self-reported fear.
The result of relative alpha wave indicated that there was a significant difference in Fp1, F3, and O3
brain areas according to a presence of adult. This means the relative alpha wave is affected by the
presence of people. The result of Fp2 showed there are clearly differences if the setting is built or
nature-dominant. All brain activity was increased in NNIG compared to BNIG when only comparing
settings. As reported, the alpha wave increased primarily when the test subject felt relaxed. Hence,
decreased alpha wave values mean that the brain has changed to a tension and excitement state, thus
this can be quite related to state feels fear. This is consistent with the self-reported fear in which fear
level decreased with an adult figure on BNIG and increased fear level with an adult on NNIG. Several
brain activities in the relative beta wave including Fp1, Fp2, and C4 showed significant differences.
Specifically, the differences in Fp1 showed BNIC/wo was lower than NNIG/w and NNIG/wo was
lower than NNIG/w, which means the setting as well as the presence of an adult affected people’s brain
activity. Overall result on beta wave indicated that, if there was an adult in setting, the relative beta
wave increased. This implies there is no direct relationship between beta wave result and self-reported
fear. The beta wave is generally divided into slow beta wave (13–21 Hz) and fast beta wave (22–30 Hz).
Beta wave commonly increased during the task requiring attention compared to the relaxed state,
and activated beta wave reflects an increase in cognitive function due to high intensity information
processing activities. Accordingly, it is supposed that increasing beta wave in setting with an adult
tells people consciously judges they can be threatened by an adult in nightscape setting. We found
that beta wave increases when paying more attention, while alpha wave decreases depending on
nightscape type in this study, and this result is consistent with previous research [15]. EEG research
using image-based EEG is as effective as engaging participants in a real environment.

4.2. Nightscape Design
There have been very few studies regarding nightscape design while daytime landscape design
studies [37] continue to be analyzed. Studies related to existing nightscape studies have been mainly
focused on light itself [38,39] or images on nightscapes [40,41]. The nightscape, complete with
awe-inspiring atmospheric events and potentially restorative fascinating stellar views, requires more
empirical investigation [42]. Nightscape design is closely related to preference, satisfaction, and light
pollution as well as perceived fear. Therefore, we invite other analysts in the field of nightscape design
to extend our findings. The insight obtained in this study regarding nightscape design is that green
element such as parks, shrubs, trees, flowers, etc. function to reduce fear and facilitate relaxation more
than built elements. It is also important to consider the significant differences between nightscape
settings through EEG, which implies its usability in nightscape study, especially for nightscape design.
Beyond the experiment in this study, constant communication between landscape designer and people
perceiving the environment at night is significant. The physical environment settings for improving
usability at night can be further improved by seizing which parts are more fearful or pleasing. Recent
research presents the possibility to measure nightscape using sophisticated technology (e.g., airborne
hyperspectral cameras [38]). In sum, various studies comparing perceived nightscape and measured
nightscape by various tools present new possibilities for enhancing the quality of nightscapes.
5. Conclusions
This study analyzed perceived fear with EEG focusing on the changing alpha and beta waves of
participants in four different types of nightscape settings to suggest its usability in nightscape design.
Our findings indicate the corresponding measures of fear vary according to the environmental settings,
which are described as follows: (1) the interaction between landscape type and adult presence was
verified, which means that other conditions such as adult presence besides landscape settings can
affect landscape evaluation; (2) the perceived fear depending on the four settings was statistically
different and the most fearful nightscape setting was BNI without the presence of an adult; and (3)
the differences of the alpha and beta waves depending on settings were significant, which means
EEG can be one of the measures for evaluating nightscape characteristics (e.g., fear, preference, etc.).
The alpha wave recorded was relatively high in nightscape settings consisting of natural elements.
Additionally, the presence of an adult affects the brain wave (both alpha and beta waves) regardless of
the nightscape setting.
This study has limitations due to the relatively few landscape types investigated and
comparatively low number of participants. We posit that this could be extended in future studies.
However, the approach we employed enables a deeper understanding of the emotional perception
and fear among human subjects by identifying the physical environment, which impacts how they
experience nightscapes. Although more specific nightscape settings should be compared using EEG
in future studies, our findings based on the physiological EEG experiment provide a new analytic
approach to studying nightscapes.
