Dikker, Wan, et al. follow a group of high
school seniors for a semester and record
their brain activity during their regular
biology class. They find that students’
brainwaves are more in sync with each
other when they are more engaged during
class. Brain-to-brain synchrony is also
reflective of how much students like the
teacher and each other.

SUMMARY

The human brain has evolved for group living [1]. Yet
we know so little about how it supports dynamic
group interactions that the study of real-world social
exchanges has been dubbed the ‘‘dark matter of
social neuroscience’’ [2]. Recently, various studies
have begun to approach this question by comparing
brain responses of multiple individuals during a variety of (semi-naturalistic) tasks [3–15]. These experiments reveal how stimulus properties [13], individual
differences [14], and contextual factors [15] may underpin similarities and differences in neural activity
across people. However, most studies to date suffer
from various limitations: they often lack direct faceto-face interaction between participants, are typically limited to dyads, do not investigate social dynamics across time, and, crucially, they rarely study
social behavior under naturalistic circumstances.
Here we extend such experimentation drastically,
beyond dyads and beyond laboratory walls, to
identify neural markers of group engagement during
dynamic real-world group interactions. We used
portable electroencephalogram (EEG) to simultaneously record brain activity from a class of 12
high school students over the course of a semester
(11 classes) during regular classroom activities
(Figures 1A–1C; Supplemental Experimental Procedures, section S1). A novel analysis technique to
assess group-based neural coherence demonstrates that the extent to which brain activity is synchronized across students predicts both student
class engagement and social dynamics. This suggests that brain-to-brain synchrony is a possible
neural marker for dynamic social interactions, likely
driven by shared attention mechanisms. This study
validates a promising new method to investigate

the neuroscience of group interactions in ecologically natural settings.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The classroom is an ideal starting point for real-world neuroscience: it provides a practically important and ecologically naturalistic context but also a semi-controlled environment, governed by
a sequence of activities led by a teacher. This allowed us to measure brain activity and behavior in a systematic fashion over the
course of a full semester as students engaged in a series of predetermined class activities (repeated across 11 50-min classes, students followed lectures, watched instructional videos, and participated in group discussions). We explored the hypothesis that
synchronized neural activity across a group of students predicts
(and possibly underpins) classroom engagement and social
dynamics. When students feel connected or engaged with the
material or each other, are their brains in fact ‘‘in sync’’ in a formal,
quantifiable sense? To investigate these questions, we used
low-cost portable electroencephalogram (EEG) systems ([16];
Supplemental Experimental Procedures, section S2) paired with
a novel analysis technique to characterize the synchronization of
brain activity between individuals: total interdependence (TI;
[17]; Supplemental Experimental Procedures, section S3). Figures
1C and 1D lay out how TI is operationalized.
We focused on the relationship between TI and classroom
engagement, on the one hand, and social dynamics, on the
other—both of which are critical for student learning [18]. Classroom engagement was quantified as student appreciation
ratings of different teaching styles (Figure 1B) and student dayby-day self-reported focus. Classroom social dynamics were
quantified in terms of socially relevant personality traits (group
affinity [19, 20] and empathy [21]) and as social closeness during
class interactions (between students and with the teacher; see
Supplemental Experimental Procedures, section S1 for details).
Brain-to-Brain Synchrony and Class Engagement
We first examined the relationship between brain-to-brain
synchrony (indexed by TI) and student ratings of four different

Figure 1. Experimental Setup, Procedure, and Rationale
(A) Timeline of the experiment. The fall semester started with a crash course in neuroscience, followed by 11 recording days distributed over a 3-month period. In
the spring semester, students designed, executed, and carried out their own original research projects (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures, section S1).
(B) Sample experimental procedure of a typical recording day: EEG activity was recorded during video, lecture, and discussion teaching styles separately, which
were consistently carried out across all 11 recording days. Other tasks were alternated (Supplemental Experimental Procedures, section S1). TI values were
averaged for each teaching style separately (marked in red; Supplemental Experimental Procedures, section S3).
(C) Illustration of experimental setup in the classroom with 12 students wearing the EMOTIV EPOC headset (Supplemental Experimental Procedures, section S2).
These portable devices offer a rich opportunity to involve students both as participants and as experimenters (Supplemental Experimental Procedures,
section S1).
(D) Brain-to-brain synchrony (TI) was computed by taking each student’s raw EEG signal, decomposing it into frequency bins (1–20 Hz, 0.25 Hz resolution), and
calculating the sum of the inter-brain coherence between pairs of students for each bin. Thus, TI quantifies the inter-brain coherence across the frequency
spectrum, allowing a data-driven identification of the brain signals of interest (see Figure S3 for further details).
(E) TI enables us to analyze brain-to-brain synchrony at multiple socially relevant levels of investigation: group synchrony (averaging TI values across all possible
pairs within a group) (i); student-to-group synchrony (averaging TI values between a given student and each of his/her peers) (ii); and student-to-student synchrony (TI values between pairs of students) (iii).

teaching styles over time. Students rated each segment after
every recording and were also asked to provide overall ratings
of each teaching style after the semester was over (Figures 1A
and 1B; Supplemental Experimental Procedures, section S1).
Significant main effects of teaching style were observed on
both student ratings (repeated-measures two-way ANOVA with
teaching style and time as main factors [see Supplemental
Experimental Procedures, section S4 for details]: day-by-day
ratings: F(3,24) = 16.85; p < 10 5; post-semester ratings:
F(3,27) = 33.29; p < 10 8) and brain-to-brain synchrony (group
synchrony: F(3,12) = 5.93; p < 0.0005; student-to-group synchrony: F(3,27) = 5.94; p < 0.005; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures, section S2). Overall, students preferred
watching videos and engaging in group discussions over
listening to the teacher reading aloud or lecturing (Figure 2A,
left panel), an effect that was even more pronounced in the
1376 Current Biology 27, 1375–1380, May 8, 2017

post-semester ratings (Figure 2A, right panel). A strikingly similar
pattern was observed for group synchrony (Figure 2B, left) as
well as student-to-group synchrony (Figure 2B, right; see Table
S2 for detailed statistics). Student-to-group synchrony exhibited
a strong positive correlation with student ratings: the higher
the post-semester student ratings, the stronger the student-togroup synchrony averaged across days (r = .61, p < 0.0001; Figure 2C; Figure 2A, right shows the same data, separated by condition and averaged across subjects). Day-by-day ratings and
group synchrony were not correlated.
Is Brain-to-Brain Synchrony Purely Stimulus Driven?
How much of brain-to-brain synchrony is explained by ‘‘mere’’
stimulus attributes (i.e., teaching style; cf. [6]), and how much
do individual differences (cf. [7]) contribute to synchrony? To
explore this, we performed a number of multiple regression

Figure 2. Independent Contributions of
Teaching Style and Individual Differences
to Brain-to-Brain Synchrony

in addition to teaching style.

and S2.

analyses to assess the relationship between TI and a number of
individual variables (ratings, focus, group affinity, and empathic
disposition), with teaching style included as a factor representing
the stimulus attribute (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures, section S3).
Post-semester ratings, while exhibiting a main effect on studentto-group synchrony (F(1,220) = 20.79, p < 0.0001), did not independently predict synchrony over teaching style (post-semester
ratings: F(1,210) = 2.28, p = 0.1327 and teaching style: F(1,9) =
2.37, p = 0.1581; Figure 2C). Student focus, in contrast, did predict
student-to-group synchrony independent of teaching style: students who were more focused on a given day also showed higher
synchrony for that day (focus: F(1,126) = 4.64, p = 0.0331 and
teaching style: F(1,9) = 29.23, p = 0.0004; Figure 2D).
Next, we examined the relationship between brain-to-brain
synchrony and students’ personality traits, in particular their
group affinity and empathic disposition ([20]; see Supplemental
Experimental Procedures, section S1 for details). Both group
affinity and empathy predicted student-to-group synchrony
independently of teaching style (group affinity: F(1,115) = 5.95,
p = 0.0163 and teaching style: F(1,9) = 12.73, p = 0.0060;
empathy: F(1,115) = 5.71, p = 0.0185 and teaching style:
F(1,9) = 13.53, p = 0.0062).
Together, these findings demonstrate that individual factors
(focus and personality traits) contribute to synchrony above
and beyond the nature of the stimulus itself.

Brain-to-Brain Synchrony and
Classroom Social Dynamics
Our findings suggest that brain-to-brain
synchrony is driven by a combination
of stimulus properties (teaching styles)
and individual differences (student focus,
teaching style preferences, teacher likeability, and personality
traits). However, none of these factors speak directly to whether
the presence of others had an effect on synchrony during class.
For example, empathic disposition affects brain-to-brain similarities even in the absence of others [14].
To address classroom social dynamics directly, we collected
social closeness ratings from students both toward the teacher
and to the other students (Supplemental Experimental Procedures, section S1) and introduced manipulations that either
did or did not involve direct social interaction. To investigate
the effect of the teacher on student-to-group synchrony, we
compared the two teaching styles in which the teacher was minimally involved (videos) and maximally involved (lectures). Figure 2D illustrates that, while students varied with respect to their
overall student-to-group synchrony, synchrony was consistently
higher for video than lecture sessions across students (p = 0.007;
see Table S1). This difference was correlated with students’ evaluations of the teacher: the more favorable a student’s rating of
the teacher, the smaller that student’s difference in synchrony
between video (where the teacher played no role) and lecture
sessions (where the teacher played an integral role; Figure 2E;
r = 0.72, p = 0.018 for data averaged across days).
We then tested whether pairwise student-to-student synchrony varied as a function of the classroom configuration (in
each class, students were randomly assigned seats by the
experimenters; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures,
Current Biology 27, 1375–1380, May 8, 2017 1377

Figure 3. Brain-to-Brain Synchrony Predicts Classroom Social Dynamics
(A and B) The difference in student-to-group TI between video and lecture sessions across students (A) (error bars reflect standard errors over days) was
negatively correlated with their ratings of the teacher (B) (r = .72, p = 0.018; each dot represents one student; TI values are averaged across days; teacher
likeability was recorded once for each student, after the semester was over).

adjacent to each other and had engaged in silent eye contact prior to class (adjacent + face-to-face), students who sat next to each other but had not participated
in a face-to-face baseline together (adjacent, no face-to-face), and students who were not sitting next to each other (non-adjacent).
(E) Students showed the highest pairwise synchrony during class with their face-to-face partner compared to the other two student pairings (error bars reflect
standard errors over student pairs).

section S1) and student interaction: as illustrated in Figures 1B
and 3C, students engaged in eye contact (face-to-face) with an
assigned peer for 2 min prior to class (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures, section S1 for details). This allowed us
to compare the relationship between pairwise synchrony and
students’ self-reported closeness to each other for three types
of student pairs: students who sat adjacent to each other and
had engaged in silent eye contact prior to class (adjacent +

face-to-face), students who sat next to each other but had not
participated in a face-to-face baseline together (adjacent, no
face-to-face), and students who were not sitting next to each
other (non-adjacent; illustrated in Figure 3D). Students showed
the highest pairwise synchrony during class with their face-toface partner compared to the other two student pairings (Figure 3E; one-way ANOVA: F(2,102) = 5.66, p = 0.0047). In addition, brain-to-brain synchrony was correlated with students’

Figure 4. Shared Attention as a Possible Account of Brain-to-Brain
Synchrony
Schematic illustration of a possible joint attention account of brain-to-brain
synchrony. Neural entrainment to an external stimulus (video, teacher, or each
other) is driven by a combination of stimulus properties (shown as arrows
flowing down from ‘‘stimulus’’) and attention (arrows flowing up to the stimulus). Under ‘‘low attention’’ conditions, students’ neural oscillations are not
entrained to an external stimulus (video, teacher, or each other) (i). Under
‘‘shared attention’’ conditions, students’ alpha oscillations are attenuated and
entrained with an engaging external stimulus: a video, the teacher, or each
other (ii). Some students are in a more attentive state, have more socially
engaged personality traits, or have directly interacted, modulating the extent
to which their neural oscillations are entrained with the stimulus (the teacher, a
video, or each other) (iii).

mutual closeness ratings, but exclusively for adjacent + face-toface pairs: student pairs who reported higher social closeness to
each other exhibited stronger pairwise brain-to-brain synchrony
during class activities, only if they had engaged in eye contact
prior to class (r = 0.5265, p = 0.0082; solid green dots and solid
line in Figure 3F; note that there was only a marginal main effect
of condition on the TI 3 closeness correlation: F(2,75) = 2.83,
p = 0.0654). In sum, face-to-face interaction prior to class not
only increased brain-to-brain synchrony during class but also
seemed to serve as an ‘‘activator’’ for interpersonal relationship
features: actual joint attention, and not passive co-presence,
predicted student-to-student synchrony.
Shared Attention as a Likely Source of Brain-to-Brain
Synchrony
It is important to emphasize that brain-to-brain synchrony is not
a mechanism in itself. Instead, neural synchrony across participants is a measurable reflection of the underlying neural computations that underpin some of the psychological processes under
investigation. To better understand the synchronization effects
we observe, mental constructs like focus, empathy, and closeness need to be decomposed into basic psychological processes that provide more suitable linking hypotheses to neural
metrics. As already briefly discussed above, the finding that stu-

dent-to-student synchrony is correlated with mutual closeness
ratings during class—but only for pairs of students who had
engaged in eye contact prior to class—aligns with research
suggesting that eye contact sets up a context for joint attention
[22]. Joint attention (shared intentionality) has been proposed to
form a scaffold for social cognition in a range of social-psychological contexts, including development [21, 23], and provides
a plausible account for prior findings showing an increase in
brain-to-brain synchrony during laboratory tasks that required
dyads to coordinate visual attention (e.g., [3, 5, 8, 11]).
We speculate that stimulus properties (teaching style [13]),
individual differences (focus, engagement, and personality traits
[14]), and social dynamics (social closeness and social interaction) each mediate attention at the neural level. This, in turn, affects students’ neural entrainment to their surrounding sensory
input: the teacher, a video, or each other [24]. This ties directly
to behavioral evidence showing that people physically (and typically subconsciously) entrain to each other when engaging in
tasks that require joint attention (pupil dilation, gestures, walking;
e.g., [25]). More broadly, student-to-group synchrony as a function of shared attention follows directly from a range of electrophysiological results showing that brain rhythms lock to the
rhythms of auditory and audiovisual input, which is amplified
when the input is attended [24, 26, 27].
To provide additional evidence that speaks to a shared attention account, we examined the relationship between student-togroup synchrony and alpha band power—a well-characterized
index of attention [28, 29]. As predicted, a reduction in a student’s alpha oscillatory activity was accompanied by an increase
in student-to-group alpha coherence (r = 0.64, p = 0.0044).
In sum, this study suggests that brain-to-brain synchrony increases as shared attention modulates entrainment by ‘‘tuning’’
neural oscillations to the temporal structure of our surroundings.
Individuals who are less engaged with the stimulus show lower
brain-to-brain synchrony levels with the rest of the group (Figure 4), and people who have interacted face-to-face show
increased entrainment to each other.
Simultaneously recording EEG data from a group of teenagers
under naturalistic circumstances presents obvious challenges
when compared to laboratory-generated EEG experiments.
Although we could not attain the level of experimental rigor
that characterizes laboratory studies, we imposed as much
structured design as possible, while minimally limiting students
to engage with each other and with the class content, as they
would under normal circumstances. Second, we carried out
EEG recordings on 11 different days with the same series of
experimental conditions, essentially replicating the same experiment 11 times on the same group of students (Figure 1A). Finally,
we carried out a series of experiments to verify that we obtained
interpretable recordings and that TI reliably indexes the synchronization of the neural signal across individuals in both the laboratory and in a classroom context (Figure S2).
Conclusions
We repeatedly recorded brain activity from a group of 12 students
simultaneously as they engaged in natural classroom activities
and social interactions. Over the course of 11 different school
days distributed over one semester, we found that brain-tobrain synchrony between students consistently predicted class

engagement and social dynamics. These findings suggest that
brain-to-brain synchrony is a sensitive marker that can predict
dynamic classroom interactions, and this relationship may be
driven by shared attention within the group. The approach we
describe provides a promising new avenue to investigate the
neuroscience of group interactions under ecologically natural
circumstances.
