Abstract—The development of equipment that measures EEG
signals leads to the research that applies them to many domains.
There are active research going on EEG signals for shared
vehicle control system between human and car. An appropriate
filtering method is also important because EEG signals normally
have lots of noises. To reduce such noises, full matrix filter,
sparse matrix reference filter, and common average reference
(CAR) filter are presented and analyzed in this paper. In order to
develop shared vehicle control system, we use controller, braincomputer interface (BCI), EEG signals, and car simulator
program. By executing t-test, it was possible to find the optimal
filter out of three filters mentioned above. With the analysis of ttest, it has revealed that full matrix filter is not appropriate for
shared vehicle control system. In addition, it proves CAR filter
has the best performance among these filters.

II. RELATED WORK
EEG equipment receives electronic signals when brain’s
neurons practice electrical activity. As EEG signals reflect
brain activity, its specific area is activated when it is in the
specific situation. EEG signals, thus, contain both time
sequential and partial characteristics [1].
The research about shared control systems are shown in
Table I. Shared vehicle control systems were tested on robots,
wheel chairs, games, and cars. Galan and Tonin’s experiment
controls the robot and wheelchair’s movement using EEG
signals, obtained when thinking about left hand or right hand.
Kim analyzed EEG signals, captured when shown left, right, or
up arrows. M. Van Vliet, in a similar case, made game by using
EEG signals to place certain object according to whatever
subject thinks. These research performed their experiment with
spatial filter or band-pass filter. Unlike these research use EEG
signals as secondary control, this paper uses them as realistic
control.

I. INTRODUCTION
The research about brain-computer interface (BCI) are
increasing recently, because of the development of equipment
to measure EEG signals. Widespread usage of BCI develops
research about machine control systems, also known as shared
vehicle control system.

Table I. Relevant work on shared control systems

These systems are used in robots, games, and wheel chairs.
They are controlled by specific EEG signals which command
directions to turn, such as left or right. Not only the directions,
but also specific situations extracted from imagination can be
controlled. As raw EEG signals cannot classify these directions
because of noises, the optimal filtering method is demanded.
To reduce such noises of raw EEG signals, this paper presents
three representative filters. All kinds of filtering methods,
however, are not appropriate for the system [4]. The accuracy
of filter has to be guaranteed over certain level for
commercialization [6]. Accordingly, the paper attempts to
figure out the best performance among the three filters.

III. THE PROPOSED METHOD
A. System architecture
Figure 1 shows the structure of the system. The whole
system consists of controller module, signal processing
module, client module, and shared vehicle control simulator.
Each module transfers its data through UDP. Controller
module receives control values, Brake and Handle values,
which are necessary for car racing. EEG signals produced by
controller module are preprocessed through filters. These
signals must complete a series of processes as shown in Figure
1. This system uses a linear classifier. Finally, classified data
are transferred from client module to simulator server.

The paper is based on the shared control system for vehicle.
To implement the system with EEG signals, the signals are
connected to the computer through BCI. Comparison and
analysis of the partial filters for noise filtering can lead to
finding the optimal filtering method [14]. The experiment
result is analyzed with t-test, which can help figure out that
EEG filtering system has no big difference in performance with
controller system.

its locality [13]. Therefore, this paper focuses on small
Laplacian. Its equation is shown in equation (4). ‘ ’ is an
element of sparse matrix. The parameters ‘ ’ and ‘ ’ represent
the number of input and output channels. Usually, four
neighbors of each output channel are chosen.

B. Shared vehicle control simulator
The shared vehicle control system can control cars through
EEG signals [4]. Filtered data, transferred by signal processing
module, need preprocessing that is proper to shared vehicle
control module. Each data has to be appropriate to each type of
Handle, Brake, and Accelerator pedal. Preprocessed data
determine acceleration or deceleration of vehicle. In addition,
the data determine left or right direction of handle.

Common Average Reference (CAR): It calculates the
average of entire channels, and subtracts this value to each
chosen channel. CAR is as shown in equation (5). The

The handle processing method is shown in equation (1). In
this equation, parameter ‘ ’ means the wheel value of vehicle,
‘ ’ means the current wheel value of vehicle, and ‘ ’ means
the range of entire wheel. Positive value of equation (1) means
right direction, and negative value means left direction. The
equation of brake is similar to equation (1).

Accelerator pedal increases velocity when transferred EEG
signals show that subject concentrates on both hands, and this
is revealed on equation (2). The parameter ‘ ’ means the
velocity of car, and ‘ ’ means the degree of concentration
with both hands. If classifier notices the concentration, then
acceleration of car increases. When there is no concentration,
deceleration occurs.
C. Partial filtering for shared vehicle control system
In order to find the optimal filter for the shared vehicle
control system, this paper adopts three representative filtering
methods. The basic structure of filtering is shown in Figure 2.
Full matrix and sparse matrix follow the form of matrix. Thus,
each element of matrix has to be determined individually. CAR,
however, does not follow the form of matrix. It calculates the
average of whole electrodes, and all input channels are
subtracted by average.
Full Matrix: It uses partial filter parameters which justify
linear transformation applied to the input signal. Full matrix is
shown in equation (3). The parameters ‘ ’ and ‘ ’ represent the
number of input and output channels, respectively. ‘ ’ is an
element of full matrix.

Figure 2. EEG signals with non-filtering and filtering
The difference between using partial filter and non-partial
filter is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2(A) and Figure 2(B) show
EEG signals when a subject rests or concentrates on both hands.
Figure 2(A) is the result of no partial filters, while Figure 2(B)
is that of partial filter. As shown in the two figures, Figure 2(B)
shows obvious difference between the two states.
IV. EXPERIMENTS
A. Experimental setup
This paper uses TORCS program as car simulator [9]. It is
open source program that makes driving environment to be
developed. By developing client program C++, TORCS is
connected to signal source. Emotiv Neuroheadset is used as
signal source to acquire EEG signals [10]. This headset
contains 14 channels. This EEG signals are preprocessed by
BCI2000.
BCI2000 is a library for BCI [7], [8]. It includes spatial
filters so that raw EEG signals can be filtered through this
library. Furthermore, this program has an application that
confirms the validation of signals whether a subject imagines
appropriate situation or not [12]. Topography of human brain
that responds to a specific situation can be achieved through
BCI2000. It uses UDP for sending data to client module.

After BCI2000 preprocesses the EEG signals, these are
used in TORCS program as an acceleration parameter [11].
The values of Handle and Brake are obtained by Logitech G20.
Using Logitech SDK, it is made possible to manipulate the
values in detail. Logitech G20 is shown in Figure 3.

EEG signals are obtained when subjects think about both
hands; specific area of brain will reflect such thought. Since
accurate imagination can show clearer brain topography, each
subject is asked to imagine both hands in certain situation
when they think about grasping their hands firmly.
B. Experimental method
The experiment is processed with five participants. A
subject was explained the test fully, and given 30 minutes to
get used to this test. Then the participants ran shared driving
simulator for ten times. We recorded each track’s lap. Track is
shown in Figure 4. The driving tracks were designed easily in
order to reduce the differences among each participant’s
varying driving abilities.

Figure 5. Average of spatial filters
Still driving with the controller, not using EEG signals, has
the shortest lap time. With the EEG signals, on the other hand,
CAR filter is the optimal filter. There is no big difference in
performance between Controller and CAR filter. Figure 6(A)
shows the standard topography when a participant thinks
about both hands. Figure 6(B) shows the topography after
filtering. As shown in this figure, CAR filter has the most
similar topography with Figure 6(A). It shows why CAR filter
has the best result. However, for the ordinary people, it is
difficult to imagine the same thought repeatedly. Thus,
representing EEG signals about imagining both hands has no
answer. Figure 7 shows that a subject’s topography has
difference compared with Figure 6(A). Therefore, some
common electrodes are used for experiment. For this reason,
subject 2’s result with CAR filter is lower than other filters.
Furthermore, it explains why some results of sparse matrix
filter have higher performance rather than CAR filter. Since
this filter is set to individual person, the diversity of brain
topography can be handled with this filter.

To confirm the difference in performance between EEG
using system and the manual controller system, this paper uses
t-test to each partial filter. If a null hypothesis is right, it is
possible that p-value has alternative hypothesis rather than the
average of sample mean.
In this experiment, significance level is set as 0.05, which
is general value, and this study sets a null hypothesis and
alternative hypothesis as below.
(A null hypothesis): There is no difference in
performance between the manual controller system and the
system using EEG.
(Alternative hypothesis): There is difference in
performance between the manual controller system and the
system using EEG.

The result of t-test is shown in Table III. CAR and sparse
matrix is bigger than 0.05. Therefore, CAR and sparse matrix
follow a null hypothesis. In conclusion, controller system and
the system using CAR and sparse matrix do not have
differences.

V. CONCLUSION
This paper presents a shared vehicle control system, using
partial filters of EEG signals. It shows that the shared vehicle
system can be controlled by EEG signals. Although
performance of EEG control system is lower than the manual
controller, there is a possibility to get better performance when
partial filters are used. It turns out that each subject’s brain
topography is quite different from one another. Since people
have difficulty in thinking repeatedly, it is hard to get accurate
topographies. From this point, sparse matrix reference filter
has low performance because it needs to manipulate
parameters individually. However, CAR filter is set for
