Abstract: People with motor and communication disorders face serious challenges in interacting with
computers. To enhance this functionality, new human-computer interfaces are being studied. In this
work, a brain-computer interface based on the Emotiv Epoc is used to analyze human-computer
interactions in cases of cerebral palsy. The Phrase-Composer software was developed to interact with
the brain-computer interface. A system usability evaluation was carried out with the participation of
three specialists from The Fundação Catarinense de Educação especial (FCEE) and four cerebral palsy
volunteers. Even though the System Usability Scale (SUS) score was acceptable, several challenges
remain. Raw electroencephalography (EEG) data were also analyzed in order to assess the user’s
emotions during their interaction with the communication device. This study brings new evidences
about human-computer interaction related to individuals with cerebral palsy.

1. Introduction
Cerebral palsy is a nomenclature used to define a group of sensorimotor and posture developmental
disorders, involving muscle tone changes, described as secondary and non-progressive motor
developmental syndromes [1]. Lesions or abnormalities in the brain are the source of these disorders
in infancy or early childhood, causing complex symptoms and various sorts and degrees of motor
involvement that permanently affect body movement and muscle coordination [2]. The prevalence
of cerebral palsy is two or three per 1000 births [3]. In Brazil, epidemiological studies reported about
30,000 new cases annually [1].
People with severe motor disorders, such as those caused by cerebral palsy, communicate through
eye movements or blinking, as well as through extremely limited finger, foot, and toe movements [4].
In severe cases, traditional interfaces and even adapted mouse and keyboards remain a barrier to
promoting interaction with computers [5].

Individuals with cerebral palsy present motor and speech disorders which constrain the usage of
traditional communication media, thus requiring great effort and skills to deal with their participation
in education and social life [6]. Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) strategies can
be employed to promote social inclusion in these complex cases [7]. AAC could supplement, or even
completely replace, speech and writing modes [2].
Nowadays, advanced AAC technologies are offering new ways of interaction with computers.
High-tech AAC solutions involve software and electronic components designed for standard computers
or mobile devices [2]. Human-computer interfaces are examples of those high-tech solutions.
Research on brain-computer interfaces (BCI) with humans began in the 1970s at the University
of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), under a grant from the National Science Foundation. This was
followed by a contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) [8].
A brain-computer interface is a kind of human-computer interface. This terminology is also known
as brain-machine interface (BMI) in the scientific literature. A BCI can be defined as a computational
system that is able to read, analyze, and interpret brain signals to trigger a desired action [9].
The research and development in the field of BCI has focused primarily on neuroprosthetics
applications to restore hearing, sight, and movement [8]. Recent research addressed the use of
brain-computer interfaces in medicine for the treatment of post-stroke conditions as well as in other
applications [10].
Brain-computer interfaces can be classified into three categories, according to how a particular
equipment acquires brain signals. These categories are invasive, partially invasive, and noninvasive [11].
Measuring electroencephalographic signals (EEG) is a simple noninvasive technique to monitor electrical
brain activity. Small signal amplitudes and noisy measurements [12] characterize this technique.
In this research, a usability study of a noninvasive brain-computer interface was performed
with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy individuals, based on the Emotiv Epoc [13]. A software,
named Phrase-Composer, was designed to interact with the Emotiv system. This software allows
writing single words and phrases [14]. User experience was preliminarily evaluated by adapting the
System Usability Scale tool [15]. In addition, data were analyzed in order to assess the user’s emotions
during interactions with the communication device.
The study was developed in partnership with The Associação Catarinense de Educação Especial
(FCEE), in Santa Catarina, Brazil. Two pedagogues, a therapist, and four cerebral palsy volunteers
participated in the study. It is expected that this study will add new evidences to the design of
accessible brain-computer applications for the target audience.
This work is an extended version of the paper submitted to the 10th International Conference
on Pervasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments (PETRA). In this version, the usability
study was extended to eight cerebral palsy users, but due to the reasons that will be exposed in this
paper, only four qualified for the next steps. In addition, a preliminary study of emotion with one of
the users was added.
2. Related Works
Within the advent of BCI, the idea of affective interfaces arose, enabling affect detection from
brain signals [16]. The authors show that there is a growing interest in researching the capabilities,
limitations, and challenges of affecting neurophysiological activity. They also present a survey of
noninvasive brain-computer interfaces, as well as their principles, state-of-the-art, and challenges.
More recently, new types of devices are being developed to enable disabled people to interact with
their environment. Studies on the uses of brain-computer interfaces to benefit individuals’ cognitive
and perceptual skills development are underway [17].
In Reference [18], the authors compared the usability of three electroencephalogram systems in
a classical BCI paradigm. They concluded that appearance and ease of setup are more important
than comfort and, without any information about effectiveness, research participants preferred the
Emotiv Epoc.

All the four adults are male, having spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy. User A, aged 40–50 years,
uses a wheelchair; his speech is not understandable; he performs head movements of low amplitude
and has low visual acuity. This user responded quite well to EEG signals. However, sometimes the
eye movements overlapped with head movements, making it very difficult to discern between them.
After the analysis, eye blink and head movement were selected to interact with the system.
User B, aged 30–40 years, has moderate mental deficiency. He uses a wheelchair and has
limitations in the upper limbs. His speech is understandable, and he has low-amplitude head
movements and visual impairment, compensated by wearing glasses. Eye blink and eye movement
were selected to interact with the system in this case.
User C, aged 30–40 years, uses a wheelchair, and moves the upper limbs with some difficulty.
His speech is not understandable. He also performs head movements of low amplitude and has low
visual acuity. Additional tests were performed to identify facial expressions with this user. After the
analysis, eye and head movements were selected to interact with the system.
User D, aged 30–40 years, uses a wheelchair; his speech is not understandable and he performs
random movement of the head. After the analysis, simultaneous blink and eye movement were
selected to interact with the system.
The last part of the experiment was performed in three or four sessions using the system.
This consisted in requesting the selection of specific letters of the alphabet, measuring the time spent,
errors and adequate alphabet letter selections. In addition, one of the pedagogues executed the same
procedures, generating a reference profile about system usability when no motor and communication
disorders are present.
The therapist and a second pedagogue conducted the experiments, deciding when it should be
stopped, for example, in case of fatigue. The experiment consisted in requesting the user to select
specific letters of the alphabet by using the system.
Table 2 shows the performance of User A. He was requested to select the first three letters of User
A’s name. The time between selections was set to 1 s for this user. There was a five minute break
between the four sessions.

Action time represents the time (in seconds) which is needed to select the first letter. In this case,
it took 12 s in the first experiment. The user selected the letters that were requested. However, it is
possible to note a slight decrease in the number of selections and an increase in the total time, from one
session to the next. This was probably motivated by fatigue or loss of concentration. On the other
hand, the time required to select the first letter was reduced in the last sessions. This procedure took
12 s in the firsts sessions and 7 s in the third and fourth trials. Another important feature is that this
user did not make any mistakes.

Figure 4 shows User A interacting with the system. Letters selection was made from the “yes”
movement of the head. The eye blink was used to delete a possible incorrect selection. In Figure 4,
User A is interacting with the system.
Table 3 illustrates the pedagogue’s performance. Blinking and eye movement were selected to
interact with the system. This participant spent one half-hour session exploring the system and three
sessions using it. After configuring and training, the participant could control the BCI and used it to
type the alphabet letters that were requested.

I think the user would need more technical support to use the system.
I think the user learned to use the system quickly.
The system does not allow proper configuration.
I would imagine that most people, under similar conditions as the user, would learn to use
this system.
I believe that this system would not meet the communication needs in cases of cerebral palsy users.
I felt that the user was very confident using the system.
The user needs previous knowledge before using this system.
The SUS score was calculated using the following equation:
score = 2.5

∑ [(q pos − 1) +

5 − qneg ]

(1)

where qpos and qneg are the values of the positive and negative items, respectively. According
to Reference [27], an SUS score above 68 indicates acceptable usability of the system or product,
and an SUS score below 50 indicates an unacceptable usability. Table A1 in Appendix A, shows the
SUS results.
5. Results
The overall evaluation was 67.5, showing an acceptable usability. Among the questions,
the student’s desire to use the system stood out positively (agree). In addition, other characteristics
were also evaluated positively (agree), such as: “I think the user learned to use the system quickly”,

Technologies 2018, 6, 28

“I would imagine that most people, under similar conditions of the user, would learn to use this
system”, and “I felt that the user was very confident using the system”. In addition, in analyzing the
negative statements “The system does not allow proper configuration” and “The user needs previous
knowledge before using this system”, the answers were strongly disagree. Other features were
evaluated as neutral, such as “Computer-user interaction through the Emotiv Epoc is too complex”,
“The use of the Phrase-Composer software is intuitive”, and “I believe that this system would not meet
the communication needs in cases of cerebral palsy users”. Among the negative aspects, the answer to
“I think the user would need technical support to use the system” was agree.
Affective Study
A preliminary analysis of the raw EEG data was also conducted in order to assess the users’
emotions during their interaction with the communication device. According to Reference [28],
positive and negative emotions are associated with alpha frequencies, from 8 Hz to 13 Hz, at points F3
and F4 in the International 10–20 System for EEG electrode placement, respectively.
The raw data were analyzed with the EEGLab software [29], filtering out noises from blinking.
Figures 6 and 7 shows the brain activity, in a range from 7 Hz to 30 Hz—from alpha to beta (Bootstrap
Method, 0.1%). In the figures, ERSP means Event-related spectral perturbation, ITC means Inter-trial
coherence and ERP means Event-Related Potential.
By correlating the brain activity data at F3 (alpha frequencies) with the videos showing the user
interacting with the device, we inferred that positive emotions were associated with moments at which

From this preliminary analysis, EGG seems to have the potential to be used to identify,
in an objective way, events (negative or positive) that usually pass unnoticed by system developers.
However, we still need to deepen our research on the use of EEG in the analysis of affective interaction
aspects between users with cerebral palsy and Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)
devices. A link to this research was included in the Supplementary Materials Video S1.
6. Discussion
Non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) based on brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been
proposed as potential assistive devices for impaired individuals. In this research, a BCI technique,
based on the Emotiv Epoc, was studied to obtain new evidence about human-computer interaction for
cerebral palsy individuals.
A therapist and a pedagogue from Fundação Catarinense de Educação Especial (FCEE) conducted
the experiments with the participation of four cerebral palsy volunteers and one pedagogue.
We considered the specialist’s point of view for each user to complete the SUS questionnaire. This was
done because the scientific literature reports the difficulty to evaluate usability in cerebral palsy
individuals due to the stringency of users’ conditions and limited communication skills. In fact,
the scientific literature highlights that brain-computer interfaces are still premature as a form of
assistive technology for people with cerebral palsy.
Quantitative and qualitative assessments produced new evidence about the design of
augmentative and alternative communication approaches for the target audience. From the qualitative
point of view, we observe that the time required to select the first letter was reduced in all cases as the
experiment was repeated. However, there was a trend to decrease the number of selections over time.
According to the qualitative evaluation, the overall score was 67.5, showing an acceptable usability.
Despite the fact that the SUS score was acceptable, several challenges remain. In fact, recognition of

Technologies 2018, 6, 28

EEG signals may not be able to be relied upon, as they require multiple training sessions and present
the necessity of exploring new processing algorithms [30]. In addition, individuals with cerebral
palsy may exhibit spontaneous and uncontrolled movements, which also affect EEG signal quality.
Moreover, motivation, fatigue, and concentration could also influence performance [23].
It is important to remark that the number of participants is usually low for this target audience.
Though four is a modest number of individuals to carry out statistical inferences on the results, it is
not considerably lower than in other works with similar user groups. For example, in Reference [20],
only seven were classified for the study; in Reference [21], only one user participated, in Reference [22],
seven, and in Reference [23], six. Moreover, the difficulties in recruiting individuals with disabilities
for usability evaluations should be taken into account, as discussed in Reference [24]. In addition,
according to Reference [25], four individuals are sufficient to reveal more than 65% of usability
problems found in other studies with a higher number of participants.
The EGG technique also allowed identifying events (affective analysis) that could go unnoticed
by the system developer, as well as identifying fragilities with potential for improvement. Preliminary
results show that positive emotions were associated with moments at which the user’s interaction with
the device did not suffer any disturbance. On the other hand, it could be inferred that negative emotions
were associated with moments when the user committed mistakes or when he was interrupted to
restart the test.
This is an experimental study in its early stages, still with several gaps. However, it is important
to remark that a standard approach to evaluate the usability of BCI for cerebral palsy individuals
has not yet been developed and the most appropriate approach may depend on the objectives of
the evaluation.
In future works, the study of facial expressions and cognitive skills will be addressed. On the
other hand, open hardware and software solutions will be approached due to the cost of current
solutions and the commercial secrecy of EEG processing algorithms.
