INTRODUCTION
An Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a medical routine
that detects abnormalities in the brain waves, or in the
electrical activity of the brain. During the test, electrodes are
pasted onto the scalp of the patient. These electrodes are tiny
metal discs with thin wires connected to the acquisition
system and they detect tiny electrical charges that result
from the activity of the brain cells. This is then amplified
and appears as a graph on the computer screen, or as a
hardcopy recording. The doctor/technician then interprets
the reading. [1]
The EEG test is performed by an electroencephalogram
technologist. It is done in the following way:[2]
• You lie on your back on a bed or in a reclining chair.
• Flat metal disks called electrodes are placed all over your
scalp. The disks are held in place with a sticky paste. The
wires protruding out of them connect to the acquisition
system. This system coverts the recording/signals into
EEG patterns that can be viewed on screen or printed
onto a sheet of paper. These patterns look like wavy
lines.
• You need to lie still during the test with your eyes closed.
This is because movement can change the results. You
may be asked to do certain things during the test, such as
breathe fast and deeply for several minutes or look at a
bright flashing light.
• You may be asked to sleep during the test.
Depending on the kind of activity and hence the
frequency range it falls in, the EEG wave can be classified
into beta, alpha, theta, delta and gamma waves. Their
frequency ranges are as follows: [3]

ADVANTAGES OF EEG
The advantages of EEG include: [4]
1. Functionally fast and are relatively cheap and safe method
of analyzing the functionality of the brain
2. High precision time measurements
3. High resolution EEG technology available that can detect
activities of even one- millisecond
4. Mostly used as a non-invasive procedure
5. Easy and simple to use
III.

DISADVANTAGES OF EEG

The disadvantages of EEG include: [4]
1. The main disadvantage of EEG recording is poor spatial
resolution
2. The EEG signal is not useful for pin-pointing the exact
source of activity. In other words, they are not very exact
3. It is difficult to differentiate between activities occurring
at closely adjacent locations
IV.

APPLICATIONS OF EEG

The applications of EEG include: [4]
1. It is mainly used in understanding properties of the brain
and its associated areas
2. When on observation, it helps the doctors to monitor
neural patterns in adults and infants. This will help them
in detecting abnormalities
3. In epilepsy, EEG is used to locate areas of the brain and
connect them to receive localization information

4. The feedback system in EEG has ample uses such as in
that of psychological, physiological, and/or neurological
disorders. This is called EEG neurofeedback
5. Many disorders as chronic anxiety, depression etc. can be
found out using as EEG pattern

PROCESSING AND FEATURE EXTRACTION
OF EEG
EEG signal processing involves the following stages: [3]

independent components. Individual and independent
components can be extracted from mixed signals by using
ICA. In this manner, independence denotes the information
carried by one component cannot be inferred from the
others. [5]
Statistically this means that joint probability of
independent quantities is obtained as the product of the
probability of each of them. [5]
The ICA finds the unmixing matrix (W) and then
projects the whitened data onto that matrix for extracting
independent signals. [8]
Mathematically,
Let Σ = Cov(X) and let X = AS, B = A-1
Then,
B = WΣ-1/2
for some non-singular W

The feature extraction methods of EEG are as follows: [5]

Then, S = BX = WΣ-1/2X with Cov(S) = I and W are
orthonormal. [9]

Principal Component Analysis
Independent Component Analysis
Time-Frequency Analysis
Wavelet Transforms

Therefore, operationally, 𝑋̃ = Σ-1/2X data is sphered and
then seek an orthogonal matrix W so that the components S
= W𝑋̃ are independent. [9]

A. Principal Component Analysis:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a wellestablished method for feature extraction and dimensionality
reduction. In PCA, we try to represent the d-dimensional
data in a lower-dimensional space. Such a representation
would reduce the degrees of freedom and the space and time
complexities. [5]
The objective is to represent data in a space that best
expresses the variation in a sum-squared error sense. To
segregate signals coming from various sources, this
technique provides to be useful. It facilitates significantly if
we know how many independent components exist ahead of
time, as with standard clustering methods. [5]
A standard PCA when used as a data analysis tool
involves a dataset of p number of observations for n number
of entities or individuals. These data values define p ndimensional vectors x1, . . ., xp or, equivalently, an n × p data
matrix X, whose jth column is the vector xj of observations
on the jth variable. [6]

Independent Component Analysis helps in segregating
the brain and non-brain components from the acquired EEG
signal. [7]
C. Time-Frequency Analysis:
The time-frequency representations, which map a onedimensional signal into a two-dimensional function of time
and frequency, can be divided into two main classes: linear
and nonlinear time-frequency representations. [10]
The linear methods include the short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) and wavelet transform (WT). The
nonlinear methods include the Wigner-Ville distribution
(WVD), the exponential distribution (ED), and the reduced
interference distribution (RID). [10]
For a function 𝑓, its Fourier Transform is given by,
𝑅
𝑓̂ = ∫−𝑅 𝑓(𝑥)𝑒 −2𝜋𝑖𝑥𝑤 𝑑𝑥

(3)

where 𝑓(𝑥) is the time-domain or temporal behaviour
and 𝑓̂ is the frequency behavior [11]

(1)

Time-frequency analysis involves the analysis of the
intermediate signals that combine data of both 𝑓 and 𝑓̂. It is
given by, V 𝑓(𝑥, 𝑤) where, it measures the strength of
frequency 𝑤 at time 𝑥. [11]

Performance of PCA helps in minimizing the data and
time required for computation. It reduces the dimension of
the EEG data. [7]

They provide the right visualization of the EEG waves
so as get the various frequency wave bands. [12]

Linear combinations are given by
∑𝑝𝑗=1 𝑎𝑗 𝑥𝑗 = 𝑋𝑎
where 𝑎𝑗 is a vector of constants a1, a2, . . ., ap [6]

B. Independent Component Analysis:
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is another
feature extraction method. This is used to convert random
signals with multiple variables into one with mutually

IJERTV9IS060814

D. Wavelet Transforms:
It is a mathematical transform that gives the timefrequency representation of the signal. It is an alternative to
the short time Fourier Transform (STFT). [13] Most of the
feature extraction techniques for classification of EEG

waves include wavelet transforms. It is usually used in the
pre-processing stage. [14]
An individual wavelet can be defined by, [15]
𝜑 𝑎,𝑏 (𝑥) = |𝑎|−1/2 𝜑 (

𝑥−𝑏
𝑎

)

(4)

The variance helps in comparing the different
dispersions of the various sets of the EEG data samples from
their means. [17]

(5)

C. Standard Deviation: [18]
The measure of dispersion of a set of data from its mean
is called standard deviation. It is given by,

Then,
𝑊𝜑 (𝑓)(𝑎, 𝑏) =

1
√𝑎

∞

∫−∞ 𝑓(𝑡)𝜑 (

𝑡−𝑏

) 𝑑𝑡

And Calderón’s formula gives,
𝑓(𝑥) =

there is significant variation between both these set of
values.

where µ is the mean of the signal

A common type of wavelet is defined using Haar
functions. [15]
This transform is used for correct analysis of EEG. It
could be seizure analysis, neuron potential modelling, etc.
[12]

VI.
FEATURE EXTRACTORS
A. Mean: [17]
The ratio of summation of all the values of the signal and
the total size of the signal is called the Mean of the signal. It
is denoted by,
𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛 (𝜇𝑥 ) =

1
𝑁

∑𝑁
𝑛=1 𝑋𝑛

(8)

where 𝜇𝑥 is the mean of the signal and {x1, . . .., xn} are
the values of the signal.
Calculation of Mean help in analysing the weights of
various sets of samples of the EEG data.
B. Variance:[18]
Mathematically, variance is a measure of statistical
dispersion of a random variable. It is given by,
𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 =

1
𝑁

2
∑𝑁
𝑖=1(𝑋𝑖 − 𝜇)

(9)

where µ is the mean of the signal

Figure 3: Analysis of Standard Deviation [18]

The figure above is a plot of the standard deviation
values of normal and seizure affected individuals. The plot
here shows that the standard deviations of the set of values
have significant difference from one another.
The standard deviation also helps in comparison between
the different dispersions of the various sets of the EEG data
samples from their means. [17]
D. Skewness: [18]
The lack of symmetry is measured by the skewness. It is
given by,
𝑆𝑘𝑒𝑤𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠 =

1
𝑁

∑𝑁
𝑖=1 [

𝑋𝑖 − 𝜇 3
𝜎

]

(11)

where µ is the mean of the signal and 𝜎 is the standard
deviation of the signal.
The value of skewness gives an interpretation on which
side of the mean point the data set is distributed.
E. Power: [17]
The measure of amplitude of EEG signal is given by
power of the signal. It is denoted by,
𝑃𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 = ∑

𝑋2
𝐿(𝑋)

(12)

Where X is the values of the signal and L(X) is the length
of the signal.

Figure 2: Analysis of Variance [18]

The calculation of Power enables analysis of the strength
with which the EEG data is occurring. This plays an
important role in drawing conclusions about the subject.

The figure above is a plot of the variance values of
normal and seizure affected individuals. The plot shows that

SOFTWARE TOOLS
The software tools usually used for signal processing
include MATLAB, Octave and SciPy. Of these, MATLAB
has always been used as a promising tool for the processing.
[19]

MATLAB
MATLAB is a software that can be used for algorithm
implementation, matrix manipulations, display and plotting
of various functions and signals, interfacing with other
programs in other languages, etc.
EEG can be analysed directly in MATLAB by writing
appropriate. But, a more effective and better way of
processing EEG data in MATLAB would be using the EEG
Lab toolbox. This interactive toolbox enables us to perform
various operations on the both continuous and event-related
EEG data such as Principal Component Analysis,
Independent Component Analysis, 2D plotting of EEG
signal, 3D plotting of EEG signal, power spectrum analysis,
etc. [22]
NeuroView
NeuroView is a software that is designed to record and
observe real-time EEG data. Other applications that are used
to analyse EEG data can import the information from
NeuroView. Programs like Excel can be used to view the
data recorded by NeuroView as they are stored as CSV
(Comma-Separate-Values) files. [23]
BCI Companies
Brain Computer Interface (BCI) devices are used to send
and receive signals between the brain and the external
environment. BCI manufacturing companies include,
NeuroSky, NeuroVista, EMOTIV, NeuroVigil, Nymi,
AliveCor, SHL, FocusBand, Atentiv, BioBeats and
Champalimaud Foundation, etc. [24] For usage in biomedical
and related equipment for easy acquisition and other
worthwhile factors, NeuroSky products are preferred. [25]
Their products help analyse biometric data in a very easy
and practical way. The solutions provided help to motivate
people and make their lifestyles better. [26]

management of epilepsy and
other seizure disorders.
[29]
Interactive MATLAB tools, NeuroView and other
similar software are used for processing continuous and
event-related EEG, MEG and electrophysiological data
using ICA, PCA and other methods including artifacts
rejection.

ThinkGear
NeuroSky uses a dry sensor technology. This is used for
the measurements, amplification of EEG signals and
brainwaves. These are also used to filter and analyse the
brainwaves and EEG signals. This technology is called
ThinkGear. This technology helps respond to person’s
mental activity aptly. [27]
This technology is used in a device named Brainsense by
Pantech Solutions. This is a single channel wireless headset
connected to the system using Bluetooth. The activity of the
pre-frontal lobe is measured thus acquiring the subject’s prefrontal cortex EEG data accurately. [28]
