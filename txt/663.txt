Abstract
With the latest advances in technology and the rise of physiological sensors for everyday life,
biofeedback is celebrating its revival and is a topic of great interest. The aim of this thesis is
a mash-up of biofeedback techniques, modern physiological sensors and 3D technology. It
investigates how to create a flexible and reusable biofeedback framework that can be used
as extendable platform for future physiological sensors and research projects. It results in
a fully operational biofeedback system that can be used to improve body awareness and
control. The thesis explains what biofeedback is, investigates physiological sensor modalities
and recording techniques, and provides a comprehensive analysis of related work in this
domain. Simultaneous acquisition of data from multiple physiological sensors introduces
new data management challenges on how to access stored data in an efficient way while still
having enough processing power available for data visualization. Rather than just mapping
a single value from a sensor like in traditional biofeedback systems, the thesis explains
how to create an interactive classification graph, where customizable classifiers combine
results from signal processing and map them to one or multiple feedback scores. The thesis
extends the traditional biofeedback loop by a control and adjust mechanism and encapsulates
analysis and classification from visualization. The two tier architecture allows the creation
of state-of-the-art visualizations with any rendering engine. Several sample visualizations
are created, including a virtual reality scene using the Oculus Rift in order to investigate
the impact of virtual reality in biofeedback. An evaluation with 8 participants, each doing 7
tests, showed that key for successful biofeedback are (1) interaction with a human feedback
controller who monitors the session, (2) interaction with a fast responding and simple
visualization, and (3) customization of classification. The thesis provides guidelines on how
to design useful biofeedback visualizations along with an investigation of the operational
capability of physiological sensors and the effect of virtual reality. As a result of this research,
a biofeedback framework with a visual and interactive graph-based classification system
was created that enables feedback controllers to easily change the classification process and
customize it for their users.

Kurzfassung
Aufgrund neuester technologischer Fortschritte und der steigenden Verfügbarkeit von physiologischen Sensoren für das alltägliche Leben, wird das Thema Biofeedback wieder aktuell
und mit großem Interesse verfolgt. Ziel dieser Diplomarbeit ist die nahtlose Verbindung
aus Biofeedback-Techniken, modernen physiologischen Sensoren und 3D Technologien. Ein
flexibles und wiederverwendbares System wird erstellt, das als erweiterbare Plattform für
zukünftige Sensoren und Forschungsprojekte verwendet werden kann. Das Resultat ist
eine funktionsfähige Biofeedback-Software, welche die eigene Körperwahrnehmung und
Körperkontrolle verbessern kann. Ferner erklärt diese Arbeit was Biofeedback ist, untersucht Modalitäten und Aufnahmetechniken von physiologischen Sensoren und stellt eine
umfassende Recherche und Analyse von verwandten Arbeiten und Projekten bereit. Die
zeitgleiche Datenerfassung mehrerer physiologischer Sensoren erfordert eine effiziente Speichernutzung um der Daten-Visualisierung genügend Rechenleistung zur Verfügung stellen
zu können. Im Gegensatz zu traditionellen Biofeedback-Systemen, welche leiglich einen Wert
von einem Sensor abbilden, erklärt diese Arbeit, wie ein interaktiver Klassifizierungs-Graph
verwendet werden kann, um anpassbare Klassifikatoren zu erstellen und die Ergebnisse von
der Signalverarbeitung auf einen oder mehrere Feedback-Werte abzubilden. Die Arbeit erweitert die traditionelle Biofeedback-Schleife um einen Kontroll- und Veränderungsmechanismus und trennt die Analyse und Klassifizierung von der Visualisierung. Die Zwei-Schichten
Architektur ermöglicht es state-of-the-art Visualisierungen mit beliebigen Render-Engines
zu erstellen. Mehrere Beispiel-Visualisierungen werden entwickelt, inklusive einer Virtual
Reality Szene, welche ein Oculus Rift verwendet, um die Auswirkungen von Virtual Reality
auf Biofeedback zu untersuchen. Die Evaluation, bei der 8 Probanden jeweils 7 Testszenarien durchliefen, zeigt, dass mehrere Faktoren für erfolgreiches Biofeedback entscheidend
sind. Dazu gehören (1) die Interaktion mit einem menschlichen Feedback-Controller, (2)
die Interaktion mit einer schnell reagierenden und simplen Visualisierung sowie (3) die
Anpassung der Klassifikatoren. Die Diplomarbeit liefert einen Leitfaden für die Gestaltung
von Biofeedback-Visualisierungen, über den Effekt von Virtual Reality und eine Untersuchung der Funktionsfähigkeit von physiologischen Sensoren. Das Ergebnis dieser Arbeit
ist ein Biofeedback-System mit einer visuellen und interaktiven Graph-basierten Klassifikation, welches es Feedback-Controller erlaubt den Klassifizierungsprozess an den jeweiligen
Benutzer anzupassen.

1 Introduction and Motivation
In order to improve the mind, we
ought less to learn than to
contemplate.
(René Descartes)

In the 17th century, the French philosopher and mathematician, René Descartes, dedicated his
life to metaphysics and the nature of substances. He tried to find and explain the connection
between mind and body, how it is possible that our mind can make our body limbs move and
how body sensation works. Descartes believed that mind and body are completely distinct.
Though his mind-body dualism theory has been controversially discussed and maybe even
proven wrong by one of modern neuroscience’s major thinkers, Antonio R. Damasio, there is
still no satisfying explanation. [Dam05]
Now, over 300 years later, the connection between mind and body is still one of the biggest
mysteries of mankind. We are fascinated about exploring our minds and bodies and still
don’t understand them completely. The European Union launched a big scientific research
project called the »Human Brain Project«, whose goal is to simulate human brains on
computers in order to get a better understanding of how they function [ELAA+ 12].
With new technology, we were able to answer parts of the question how our mind correlates
with our body and if our body is relaxed or stressed along with the mind, when measuring
mental activity changes [Jac04]. What if we go a step further and don’t aim for understanding
but for controlling body activity and our minds? What if we could train subliminal body
activity and our minds like we do when going to the gym? Wouldn’t it be incredible if there
were tools and methods that can be used to teach body awareness and increase control?
Being in complete control of our body is a step towards being in control of our lives.
Multiple interest groups ranging from medical research, mental therapy as well as traditional
body awareness coaching and training like yoga provide partial answers. In the seventies,
when technology advanced and we were able to sense first body activities, the idea for
biofeedback came up. Biofeedback is a technique where physiological sensors are attached to
the body, making information available to the mind in order to understand and manipulate
physiological activity. It is a process that enables the mind to learn to be more aware of what
is happening inside the body [Wes07].
Biofeedback is controversially discussed and never really broke through so far [PB02].
Sensing body and brain activity a long time was only available for medical applications and
thus has not been accessible in everyday life. A change and also a revival of biofeedback is
happening at the moment with the introduction of low-budget, consumer brain-computer

9

1 Introduction and Motivation

interfaces, smart gadgets and health tracking devices. The Consumer Electronics Show1 2014
in Las Vegas was full of them: Kiwi Move for example is a multi-use device that counts
steps, tracks movement and has built-in gesture control2 . There are health tracking gadgets
like fitbit3 , JAWBONE4 , the Nike+ Fuelband5 and Basis6 that record and analyze activity
at daytime or while sleeping and offer online user portals where statistics are presented.
There is Myo7 , an armband that senses electrical activity in muscles to wirelessly control a
computer or any other device, Emotiv Insight8 , a new multi-sensor brain-computer interface
using dry sensors. Intel, as well as many other global players, started new subsidiaries that
are focusing on wearable technology and physiological sensors9 .
With the latest advances in technology and the accessibility of physiological sensors for
everybody, we believe that biofeedback is a topic of great interest for future research and
products.
In this thesis, we explore the field of biofeedback and build a powerful framework that can
be used as extendable platform for future physiological sensors and research projects. Next
to the implementation of the system, comprehensive analysis of related work in the field and
an evaluation are done.
Simultaneous acquisition of data from multiple physiological sensors, that output several
thousands of samples per second, requires careful data management. The challenge is
about finding and implementing efficient data structures that are capable of accessing
stored data quickly, while still leaving enough processing power available for real-time data
visualization.
We extend the traditional biofeedback loop and separate analysis from visualization. Due
to the separation, we combine processing power in order to allow state-of-the-art visuals
while not being bound to a specific rendering engine. It is easy to add all kinds of new
physiological sensors to the framework as software architecture allows fast specification,
data management and data translation.
Rather than directly mapping results from signal processing to visuals and audio like in
other biofeedback applications, we use fully customizable classifiers and feedback scores.
Analysis and classification of data from connected sensors happens in our graph-based
classification system which enables feedback controllers to easily change the classification
process and customize it for their needs visually. Our biofeedback framework is not only
a platform for further research projects, but also allows us to create and test new feedback
score combinations and calculation formulas.

A rendering engine is used to create a set of different visualizations ranging from a complete
car racing game to a simple particle-based feedback visualization. Moreover, we present
a virtual reality biofeedback environment using an Oculus Rift10 in order to research the
impact of a virtual reality environment in biofeedback.
Lastly, we evaluate the system with the aim to find best practices for classification, visualization and biofeedback interaction. Comfort, ease of use, degree of frustration as well as
the adaptability to different users is investigated along with the operational capability of
physiological sensors and the effect of virtual reality.
This thesis is designed as a mash-up of biofeedback techniques, modern physiological
sensors and 3D technology. Though we are not able to answer questions neuroscientists
and mental therapists work on for decades, we provide a powerful platform for future
biofeedback research and a classification system that is considered as valuable contribution
since no comparable system exists.

2 Background
In this chapter, we will first have a look at what biofeedback is, what it is used for and what
can be achieved with it. As biofeedback techniques are the foundation of the project, we will
check where it comes from and how it is applied.
Understanding what kind of information we can sense and how we can give the user a
feedback response are preliminaries for the project. After having a look at the base of
biofeedback, we will present several physiological sensors. We will walk through techniques
for recording and evaluating physiological data and introduce sensors that are particularly
used within this project in greater detail. Furthermore, other available sensory information
will be briefly introduced to get an overview about what is possible.
Lastly, neurofeedback and the electroencephalography as its base recording technique will be
discussed separately, as it will play an important role in the project. After going through the
presented technological and medical essentials, we will be ready for the following chapters.

2.1 Biofeedback
Biofeedback is a technique where sensors are attached to the body, making information
available to the mind in order to understand and manipulate physiological activity. It is a
process that enables the mind to learn to be more aware of what is happening inside the
body. Sensors are attached to the human body while they are connected to a computer. The
recorded data is shown, providing the user a direct or a modified version of the recorded
data as feedback. Figure 2.1 shows a traditional biofeedback system.
Feedback is a powerful tool for learning new things. If the mind senses a signal, it responds
to it. The mind has a big library of how to respond to given signals like for example the
conscious response to hunger is that we eat something [Wes07]. There are also automatic
feedback responses such as goose bumps or shiver when it’s cold outside and the body
temperature is about to become too low.
When training a given response to a signal, over time, it is possible to learn to convert a
conscious choice into an automatic reaction. We can for example train to put a jacket on
before leaving a building in winter to avoid shiver. Detecting shiver is a lot easier and
obvious than detecting an increase of the heart rate or the skin temperature for example.
Without help from technical devices, it is very hard to get an objective snapshot of the body
status. The key is to make signals available to the person. Gaining access to information
that normally is not available, biofeedback techniques can help the mind to interpret more

accurately and to learn to influence the body. Just like training an absolute pitch by listening
closely, minimal differences in sensing the skin temperature might start or stop the internal
heating system. One of the first goals of biofeedback is to understand the provided signals
that are brought back to the person as audio or visual feedback as well as to understand the
controlled modification of specific activities inside the body. [Kha13]

2.1.1 History
Biofeedback has its roots in Hindu practices like yoga or pranayama where one of the goals is
to regulate the basal metabolism rate. The basal metabolism rate is the amount of energy the
body needs when resting. Combining these traditional techniques and extending them with
modern technology was the birth of modern biofeedback. Several independent researchers
in the United States started experimenting with autonomic feedback systems and their effect
in the early 60s of the 20th century [LWS07].
Soon after the formation of the Biofeedback Society of America in 1976, Elmer and Alyce
Green successfully found a way to reduce symptoms of migraine headaches by autogenic
biofeedback temperature training sessions. Clinical research reports and papers started to
emerge about topics like self-regulation, tension reduction and anxiety [Sch03]. The first
national biofeedback certification was available in 1991. With the rise of neurofeedback and
its close relation to biofeedback, the Biofeedback Neurofeedback Alliance was formed in
2008. [LWS07]

2.1 Biofeedback

Today, biofeedback is still viewed critically and discussed controversially but its acceptance
is gaining momentum and in some areas of the United States and other countries like Hong
Kong or Singapore it is a common practice [PB02].

2.1.2 Modality
There are several stages in biofeedback training. The very first step to successfully complete
a training is to decode the provided feedback information that is given by the system to
one of our five senses. Typically, certified therapists teach the patient how to interpret the
visual or audio feedback. After testing and playing around with the feedback system, first
uncontrolled modifications will normally show up [WB79].
The next step is to achieve control over the physiological response. The therapist can
help to achieve the goal using influencing techniques like imagery or autogenic training
while the user is trying to consciously manipulate his or her body [Sea12]. With enough
practice, people can learn to regulate internal functions. The ultimate goal of biofeedback is
self-control through conditional response. A conditional response is the ability to reliably
influence physiological activity in the absence of feedback [WB79]. The last step is to transfer
these new abilities to situations in everyday life like e.g. to relax by command in the office,
before an important speech or a job application.
One of two types of feedback is given by traditional biofeedback equipment. Binary feedback
lets the user know if his attempt to influence his body is working or not. This can for
example be visually shown with a light that turns on and off. The second type is known as
proportional feedback. Proportional feedback provides the amount or magnitude of how
effective the user is currently controlling his body. This can for example be encoded into the
volume of a sound or just be visualized by a number. [Sea12]

2.1.3 Applications
There are many articles and studies on biofeedback that proof it is working while others say
it is not. Biofeedback can be used to treat headaches, back pain or incontinence. In contrast
to the scientific background though, biofeedback is controversially discussed and not fully
accepted yet by German health insurances [RB06].
The Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback (AAPB) together with the
International Society for Neuronal Regulation (ISNR) created a database of effectiveness
levels for diseases that can be and have been successfully treated using biofeedback. The
levels range from 1 to 5, from not empirically supported to efficacious and specific.
Arthritis, Pediatric headache and insomnia are rated as probably efficacious. Anxiety, chronic
pain, hypertension, motion sickness, migraine headache and Raynaud’s disease are classified
as probably efficacious. Biofeedback seems to work best on adult tension headaches. Adult
tension headache got classified as efficacious and specific, which is the highest available
ranking [Kha13]. Other to classic clinical applications, biofeedback is also used for human

performance optimization, stress reduction, wellness or improving work-life balance. See
Chapter 3 for more information.

2.2 Physiological Sensor Modalities and Recording Techniques
In this section, we will have a look at physiological sensors and recording techniques. We
will give you a brief overview on the sensors that can be used for biofeedback. The structure
is based on the techniques and information provided by the physiological sensors. The
sensors itself will be explained within these as well. Sensor information, how they work and
how to interpret the results will be discussed. After this section, you will know about what
physiological sensors are available and how we can use them for the project.

2.2.1 Electrocardiography (ECG)
Electrocardiography is a non-invasive recording method that senses electrical activity at the
body surface generated by the heart (cardio). ECG is commonly used for measuring heart
rate, the regularity of heartbeats and the magnitude and location in time. The evaluated
information is used for research, to determine performance of the heart and diagnosis of
heart diseases. Electrodes are traditionally attached to the torso, wrists or legs and record
electrical activity over time. When the heart muscles contract and pump blood through
the body, electrical potential changes over time [Wag08]. The plotted result of the electrical
activity over time is called eletrocardiogram. An example of a recurrent curve per heart beat
that can be seen in ECG is shown in Figure 2.2.
Using ECG, the heart rate can be evaluated. The heart rate is calculated by taking the
RR-Interval and extrapolating it to 60 seconds. The RR-Interval is the interbeat interval,
which is the distance in time between two peaks of a curve. The area around the peak is
called the QRS-Complex with the R-Wave peak in the middle. This is why the heart rate is
also known as RR-Rate.
The smaller changes in magnitude on the left and right side of the QRS-Complex are known
as the P-Wave and the T-Wave. The P-Wave and the T-Wave are produced by contraction
of heart muscles and their repolarization. The same data curve can be used to calculate
the heart rate variability. Superimposing several RR-Intervals and calculating statistical
differences leads to heart rate variability [CTB07].

2.2.2 Pneumography
Pneumography is mainly used for evaluating the breathing rate, which is also known as
respiration rate. The respiration rate indicates how often we breathe per minute. Normal
adults breath about 12 to 18 times per minute when resting. There are two ways to evaluate

16

2.2 Physiological Sensor Modalities and Recording Techniques

the breathing rate. One is capnography and will be further discussed in Section 2.2.7 and
the other one is the currently presented one, Pneumography.
Pneumography is a non-invasive technique and is said to be the one that works better for
determining the breathing rate [GBM+ 72]. The first type of respiration sensors is placed
around the chest. It records velocity and forces from chest movements while breathing in
order to determine the number of breaths per minute.
Another type are impedance-based respiration sensors. Impedance-based respiration sensors
spawn high frequency, low electrical currents into the chest. Voltage alterations are measured
and used to calculate the electrical resistance of the chest. Based on how much the lungs
are extended and filled with air, the resistance levels change. Electrical resistance increases
when breathing in, while it decreases when breathing out. The measured values can be used
to calculate the breathing rate [GBM+ 72]. Figure 2.3 shows a schematic representation of an
impedance-based pneumography sensor.
Pneumography can be used to train abdominal breathing, which is the natural way to breath
using the diaphragm and e.g. important for singers [LS88]. It can also be used to sense
relative depth of breathing or to detect dysfunctional breathing patterns such as reverse
breathing or the counterpart to abdominal breathing, thoracic breathing.

2.2.3 Skin Temperature Thermometer
There are four different commonly used temperature measuring sensors: The thermocouple,
the resistance temperature detector (RDT), the thermistor and the integrated circuit sensor
(IC). The temperature voltage relation for each sensor type is shown in Figure 2.4.
The thermistor is the one of interest for biofeedback purposes due to its high precision.
Resistors change their respond behavior along with temperature changes. Thermistors are
resistors that are especially sensitive to temperature changes. In contrast to other resistors,
thermistors decrease their electrical resistance when temperature increases and vice versa.
Electrical resistance is predictably constant for given temperature levels. Based on several

reference values, which are part of the resistor hardware specifications, temperature can be
calculated. Thermistors are cheap and widely available. They are easy to use and include
into circuits as they have a reasonable output voltage that can be used for detection without
complex amplification. Thermistors respond quickly and therefore are great for real-time
feedback applications. [Tec12]
Temperature sensors for biofeedback applications are usually placed at body extremities
like at the front of a finger. Stressful events, arousal or more generic, sympathetic nervous
activity leads to temperature decreases. The arteriole diameter depends on body temperature
and changes along with it. As temperature sensors for biofeedback applications are very
sensitive, air flow needs to be minimized around the sensor for correct results. Patches could
for example be used to avoid unwanted temperature alterations. [Tec12]

2.2 Physiological Sensor Modalities and Recording Techniques

Figure 2.5: Electrodes placed onto the surface of the skin to record muscle fiber activity
[KG10].

2.2.4 Electromyography (EMG)
Electromyography is a technique to sense electrical activity that is produced by muscle fibers.
There is an invasive method called intramuscular electromyography and a non-invasive one
called surface electromyography, also known as SEMG. Intramuscular EMG is considered as
too invasive and unnecessary in most cases. Thin needles are inserted into the muscle fibers
and record electrical activity. Using this method, we can observe single muscle fibers while
with the SEMG we can only see results from a sum of multiple muscle fibers. In contrast to
intramuscular EMG, surface EMG is a non-invasive technique where electrodes are placed
onto the surface of the skin.
An electromyograph, like e.g shown in Figure 2.5, reveals what a muscle does in realtime. Muscles generate electrical activity and can be in either of the following three states.
Concentric is the state where the muscle shortens as tension is applied. Isometric is the
relaxed state and no movement is seen. The last state is called eccentric. This is when the
muscle lengthens and the tension is less than the load [Flo10]. Based on the electromyogram
we can see in which state the muscle is, by interpreting the electrical potential that is
generated by muscle cells over time. Electrical potentials are mostly measured in microvolts
and range from less than 50µV to 50mV. Changes in muscle fiber lengths change the EMG
amplitude. [KG10]
Temperature changes can also affect the characteristics of the potentials and have to be taken
into account when interpreting results. Larger muscles or muscles that are located closer
to the surface produce bigger amplitudes than smaller muscles or muscles deeper inside.
Muscles contract when motor neurons fire and give the command to do so. Motor neurons
fire with a frequency of around 7Hz to 20Hz when keeping up the signal. The EMG is used
for physical rehabilitation, by orthopedics, for biomechanics, sport training, motion analysis
and ergonomics to e.g. check for medical abnormalities and activation levels. [KG10]

2.2.5 Electrodermography (EDG)
Electrodermography is a technique to measure electrical skin activity by either the skin
conductance, the skin potential or the galvanic skin resistance. The three ways are closely
related and can be all sensed by non-invasive electrodes. One electrode is usually placed
on the fingers or palms and another one, the reference electrode, is placed on the forearm.
An imperceptible electrical current is applied that travels from one to the other electrode
[ET11]. The value of how easily the applied current can travel is known as either the skin
conductance activity (SCA), galvanic skin response (GSR) or electrodermal activity (EDA).
The various measures of the EDG depend on and change along with the activity level of
perspiration glands. The bigger the perspiration gland activity, the higher the electrical
conductance and the lower the resistance of the skin. The perspiration glands themselves are
under control of the sympathetic nervous system [PW81]. This is why the EDG provides
information about the level of psychoemotional stress, worry and cognitive activity. Fingers
are the first part of the body that start to sweat when stress increases. Sweat is a well
electrical conductor and supports the electrical current traveling through the skin [And80].
Electrodermography is used in clinical applications for treating anxiety disorders, hyperhidrosis and stress. Another application is lie detection. When lying, stress levels increase
and lead to a greater amount of sweat. The EDG is also used to learn to understand emotions
[TT75] or to train athletes to deal with past injuries [ET11].

2.2.6 Photoplethysmography (PPG) and Pulse Oximetry
Using a non-invasive technique called photoplethysmography, we can sense the relative
blood flow and the blood volume pulse (BVP) optically. A schematic representation of a
PPG sensor is shown in Figure 2.6. The sensor is often attached to the fingers or palms. A
light source, usually an infra-red LED at the sensor, transmits into the tissue and illuminates
it [Kub10]. A phototransistor, which is also part of the PPG sensor, absorbs the reflected
light and measures the slight changes. More light is caught by the phototransistor in case
the amount of blood is high. The less blood is pumped through blood vessels, the less light
will be absorbed by the sensor. Tissue also damps illumination and has to be taken into
account.
The PPG sensor must be pressed against the skin in order to function correctly. Otherwise,
peaks of the resulting wave can’t be read and analyzed clearly. Each pulse pressure changes
the amount of blood and thus the amount of reflected light. Depending on the location,
shape of the wave varies. Using a photoplethysmograph, we can not only measure the
relative blood flow, but also monitor heart rate and cardiac cycles. We can even approximate
the respiration rate based on the pressure changes. The pressure in blood vessels changes,
depending on the filling in the lungs. When breathing in, pressure decreases while it
increases when breathing out as the heart is pushed together in this case. Pressure levels
also decrease along with the distance of the sensor from the heart. Though a lot information
can be gathered and extracted using PPG, there are limitations. [KG10]

2.2 Physiological Sensor Modalities and Recording Techniques

and a phototransistor absorbing and transforming light into an electrical signal
[Kub10].
Pulse oximetry is derived from photoplethysmography and is a very similar approach. It
measures the relative amount of oxygen saturation in the blood. Pulse oximeters use light
of two wave lengths and sense absorbance for both. The additional wave length is used
to subtract any disturbance by blood, bones or skin. Researchers were able to create pulse
oximeters for under $20.00 for use with mobile phones [KBP10].

2.2.7 Capnography
Capnography is a technique to measure relative amount of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) in any
kind of gas. Its fundamental principle is shown in Figure 2.7. Capnography is mostly
used to measure the amount of CO2 in the air before breathing in or after breathing out.
Capnography is closely related to pulse oximetry due to the relation between the amount of
oxygen in the blood and the amount of carbon dioxide in the breathed air.
Capnographs are seen as essential and valuable tools for anesthesiologists when monitoring
patients. They are used to check and control the depth of anesthesia and are big supporters
in finding right solutions in life-threatening situations. Most rebreathing systems used in
ambulances or intensive care include capnographs. The sensed amount of carbon dioxide is
used to control the ratio of oxygen fed into the rebreathing system. The sensor is hooked
into the breathing pipe and uses the same kind of infrared light change detection method as
described in Section 2.2.6. [Sai94]
CO2 absorbs infrared light. The higher the relative amount of CO2 in the air, the lower is
the sensed radiation at the phototransistor. Capnography is an accurate method that can be
used in real-time environments. Typical values for the relative amount of carbon dioxide in
the air when breathing out on resting adults are 4.3% to 5.7%. The results are also a sensitive
index of quality of breathing. Slow, deep breathing increases the level of carbon dioxide in
the air when breathing out, fast and thin breathing decreases it. A capnograph can also be

21

2 Background

[Sai94].
used to determine the breathing rate, as the amount of carbon dioxide in the air passing the
sensor is higher when breathing out than when breathing in. [Sai94]

2.2.8 Eye Tracking
Eye movement and rotation says a lot about our emotions and what we are currently
interested in and searching for. Eye tracking techniques are used to record eye orientation
and movement. Based on this information, points of interest, which are also known as
points of gaze, can be calculated. Fast eye movements over time can be detected as well.
Eye trackers are devices or systems that are capable of recording and sensing the given
information.
There are two types of eye trackers. First, head-mounted eye trackers, which are mobile
systems attached to the user head that have sensors placed directly at or close to the eyes.
Second, table-mounted eye trackers, which are systems sensing eye movement from a fixed
remote location. There are several techniques that can be used for eye tracking. Special
contact lenses that sense magnetic field changes can be used for detecting eye orientation.
Next to magnetic field changes, we can also measure electric potentials using electrodes
placed around the eyes. This enables us to even detect orientations when the eyes are closed.
Though, both of these methods are very accurate when it is about relative movement, they
are not when we need to determine points of gaze. Another technique to track the eyes is
called optical tracking. Infrared light is transmitted to the eyes while a video camera or a

22

2.2 Physiological Sensor Modalities and Recording Techniques

Figure 2.8: Eye tracking heat map visualization. It shows the fixation locations and the
duration of the fixation using a color scale moving from blue to red [CG07].
special optical sensor analyzes the reflected light. Based on reflection changes over time, eye
orientation can be calculated. [Duc07]
Eye tracking results are sometimes visualized by paths whose segments are colored based
on the time rested at given points in time. Another visualization way is heat mapping. Heat
mapping is a technique where eye movement is projected onto a translucent texture where
each time step changes the color of the pixels surrounding the point of interest. An example
of a heat map is shown in Figure 2.8. Eye tracking has a whole variety of applications. It is
used in neuroscience, cognition and advertising psychology, product packaging design and
marketing [WP08]. Eye tracking also helps researchers to improve usability [NP10] or even
enables cars to detect when their driver is becoming tired [HCC04].

2.2.9 Brain Sensor Modalities
Several non-invasive techniques and sensors for extracting brain information exist. Hemoencephalography (HEG) measures the blood flow at the surface of the head using infrared
imaging techniques. The amount of oxygen in blood changes the reflected light. Based on
light information, the blood flow is determined. REG is used to treat patients with ADHD
who have low blood flow in some areas of their brains.
Rheoencephalography (REG) is another technique to measure brain blood flow by placing
several electrodes at the forehead. Changes in pulse volume are closely related to changes in
electrical resistance. Electrical currents vary along with the flow of blood and heart beats.
With each heart beat, blood gets pumped through the blood vessels changing the relative

23

2 Background

blood flow and thus the electrical resistance. The amplitude of measured waves specify the
blood flow below the electrodes. [McH95]
Brain activity can be recorded using the well-known electroencephalography (EEG). The
EEG measures electrical potentials at several locations on the head surface using electrodes.
Information about what areas of the brain are active can be extracted. A detailed explanation
of what the EEG is and how it works can be found in Section 2.3.2. Changes in electrical
potential below 1Hz can’t be detected by an EEG. A slow cortical potential (SCP) sensor can
be used to gather these changes and close the information gap. The introduced techniques
and sensors in this section are all used for neurofeedback, which is what we are going to
have a look at in the following section.

2.3 Neurofeedback
In this section, we will first have a look at the difference between biofeedback and neurofeedback. After we have a brief understanding of what neurofeedback is, we will have a
look at how our brain functions, how it is structured and how brain activity is generated.
The following part will explain how the most popular brain activity recording device, the
electroencephalogram, works. Before going on to Chapter 3, we will take a tour through
brain activity patterns in order to be able to interpret resulting information from the EEG.
Neurofeedback is a derived term of biofeedback. Biofeedback is a general term to body
function feedback that is under involuntary control. Neurofeedback, or sometimes also called
EEG biofeedback, specifically refers to brain wave assessment and training brain activity.
It is the latest of biofeedback developments, more complicated and seen as a separated
biofeedback subgroup with its own conferences and associations [CE11].
Biofeedback modalities can be applied and used similarly with neurofeedback. Sensors listen
to brain activity while a computer analyzes and visualizes it in real-time. A therapist sees
brain waves and calculated frequency bands on a screen while a user is commonly trying to
achieve some goal in a mini game. This can e.g. be a simple ball that needs to be moved by
given brain activity. These kind of training sessions can be used to improve concentration
levels or to feel calmer and less stressed. Neurofeedback has been successfully used in
medical applications like treating insomnia, headaches, epilepsy and autistic disorders
[Sea12].

2.3.1 The Human Brain
The brain is our primary command center. Billions of interconnected neurons are processing
information and control our body and internal organs. Our brain generates thoughts and
emotions, stores and recalls memories, gives us capacity for language, moral judgments
and rational thoughts. It is a highly complex organ that has been studied for centuries by
researchers while we are still far away from fully understanding it.

24

2.3 Neurofeedback

Figure 2.9: Structure of the human brain [Car09].
The brain is a wrinkled, jelly-like mass that weights about 1.4 kilograms, which roughly
makes 2% of the whole body mass. The human brain consists of three main parts: First,
the cerebrum, which is the largest part of our brain. It makes up to 85% of the brain’s
weight. The outer surface of the cerebrum is called cerebral cortex. The second largest part is
cerebellum. The cerebellum, also called the »little brain« and receives information from the
spinal cord and other parts of the brain. The last part is the brain stem, or spinal cord. The
brain stem is based at the bottom center of the brain and regulates our heart rate, breathing
rate, blood pressure, reflexes, swallowing and sleeping.
The cerebrum can be further divided into four lobes, the frontal lobe, the occipital lobe,
the parietal lobe and the temporal lobe (see Figure 2.9). The frontal lobe is located directly
behind the forehead and is responsible for thinking, learning, speaking, mental processing,
moving, behavior and emotions. It also plays an important role in retraining long-term
memories. The occipital lobe is the visual processing center and is located at the back of
the brain. The parietal lobe is positioned between the frontal and the occipital lobe and is
responsible for sensory information such as touch, temperature, and pain. The temporal lobe
is located between the brain stem and the other three lobes at the lower end of the brain. It
is responsible for sound processing, comprehending language, deriving meaning and certain
memory functions. [FFD+ 04]
Seeing the brain from a top view, we can divide it into a left and a right hemisphere. The
left hemisphere is typically the analytic side where we process math and language oriented
information. It also controls most functions on the right side of our body. The right side is
mostly where our creativity and spontaneous thoughts come from. As the counterpart of the
left hemisphere, the right hemisphere controls most functions on the left side of our body.
[Nol10]
Though scientists have studied the brain extensively, they are nowhere near to fully understand it. The presented structure of the brain does not apply to all human beings. Some

25

2 Background

people with brain injuries in e.g. the left frontal lobe are still able to solve complex mathematical tasks but might suffer social competence at the same time [Dam05]. In order to
further study and understand the human brain, the European Union formed the Human
Brain Project [ELAA+ 12].
Going inside the brain, we find about 100 billion nerve cells that communicate with each
other, put our thoughts together and coordinate physical actions. Together with the glial
cells, nerve cells build our nervous system. Nerve cells in the brain and central nervous
system are called neurons. Neurons are the base unit of neural networks.
Each neuron consists of three main components: A nucleus, dendrites and an axon (see
Figure 2.10). The nucleus is located in the cell body, where multiple dendrites and one
axon are attached to. Neurons send electrochemical messages via a network of nerve fibers
[LK02]. Dendrites receive signals from other neurons and pass it along to the Axon Hillock,
where the signal gets regulated. The modified input information from other neurons will
then be sent as electrical signal to the axon ends. The bridge between the axon and other
dendrites is called synapse. Information inside synapses, so from an axon to a dendrite,
is either exchanged via chemicals called neurotransmitters or via electrical current in the
case of gap junctions [DM04]. From a mathematical point of view, each neuron can be seen

26

2.3 Neurofeedback

as multi-variable function, with many input variables (dentrides) and one output or result
(axon) [Gur97].
When neurons communicate with each other, electrochemical messages (neurotransmitters)
are sent. Neurotransmitters are endogenous chemicals, located at the synapse membrane,
that cause electrical signals by quickly opening and closing their channels and thus causing a
discharge. Neurons will fire and discharge when a given membrane depolarization threshold
is reached. Electrochemical messages are sent with high speeds. They can travel with a
speed ranging from 0.55m/s up to 111m/s [EA03]. The electrical impulses are called action
potentials. Though an action potential is very weak signal, a current can be measured in case
many neurons fire at the same time. Measuring groups of simultaneously firing neurons
reveals a coarse measure for brain activity. And this is where the electroencephalogram
comes into the scene. [DM04]

2.3.2 Electroencephalography (EEG)
Before going down to have a further look at what the EEG is, we will talk about the
possibilities to study the brain. First of all there are two groups of monitoring devices,
invasive and non-invasive. Invasive in this context means that the sensors have to be
surgically implanted on the surface or within the depth of the brain. This comes with a high
risk and is to be avoided if possible.
There are three commonly used, non-invasive techniques: Magnetoencephalography (MEG),
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). MEG is a technique
that senses weak magnetic fields produced by neurons in order to record brain activity.
MEG has a better spatial resolution than EEG and is used to e.g. locate brain tumors before
a surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging is used to create a set of slices of various body
parts, such as the brain. It has by far the highest accuracy and can localize brain activity
changes in regions of up to one cubic millimeter. The downside of MRI is that its temporal
resolution is very weak. MRI is used to get a view inside the brain structure and is the eye
of neurosurgeons. [ML10]
The electroencephalography is a non-invasive method for recording electrical activity changes
on the scalp by placing electrodes on the head. EEG is a standard tool in neurology and
e.g. used in hospitals for declaring patients to be brain dead. As electrical currents of
single neurons are too weak, EEG is only able to detect mass changes in synaptic activity.
Depending on the position and orientation of simultaneously firing neurons, electric potential
changes can be recorded [ED05]. The electrical signals on the scalp are very weak and range
between 1µV and 100µV. Thus, signals need to be amplified sensitively and possible artifacts
need to be reduced. The electroencephalogram is a graphical representation of the currents
sensed by the electrodes over time. An example is shown in Figure 2.11.
There are two types of sensors used, wet and dry sensors. Wet sensors need to be hydrated
before use with e.g. a saline solution. The first dry sensor was developed in 1994 [Kni94]

and then further enhanced into a large scale EEG device by NeuroSky1 . Sensors of the EEG
can record events lasting less than 1 millisecond which makes it possible to use the EEG in
real-time environments. Though the temporal resolution is very good, the spatial resolution
is not close to comparable to the resolution of MRI. The number of electrodes placed on
the scalp can vary. For clinical usage at least 12 electrodes are required in order to get a
reasonable spatial resolution. In this case, every few centimeters an electrode is placed. Hans
Berger was the first to ever record a human EEG in 1924 [Mil01].

2.3.3 10-20 Electrode Placement System
The 10-20 system describes how to place the electrodes onto the scalp. Developed by
H.H. Jasper in 1959, it became the international standard as there was a need to compare
and reproduce results from studies. This was impossible when using different electrode
placements. The values 10 and 20 are relative electrode distances in percent, meaning that
the distance to the neighbor electrode is either 10% or 20% of the total front to back or right
to left distance of the head. The electrode locations are shown in Figure 2.12.
Based on the 10-20 system naming convention, each electrode has a unique identifier. The
identifier consists of an alphabetic character followed by a number. The alphabetic character
identifies the brain lobe: F for frontal, T for temporal, P for parietal and O for occipital lobe.
There are other letters used which do not refer to a lobe but are only there for identification
purposes. C refers to electrodes placed at central positions, A is used for the ears and the
postfix z is used for electrodes placed on the midline. The starting point for the 10-20 system
at the top is the nasion N. The corresponding end point is the inion I. The distance between
the nasion and the inion is used to calculate the vertical relative displacements whereas the
ears are used for horizontal calculations.
The number next to the identification character is there to further differentiate the electrodes.
An even number means that the electrode is placed on the right hemisphere while odd
numbers are used for electrodes on the left hemisphere. [Jas59]

2.3.4 Brain Activity Patterns
Experts can diagnose brain diseases by just watching EEG waves. They know about the
nature of brain activity patterns and how they look. For example other wave types are seen
in an awake state than when sleeping. Interpreting brain waves is not an easy task though.
Distribution of brain activity patterns are very different between humans and also change
along with the age. Amplitudes of most of the waves range from 10µV to 100µV and lie
within 1 and 50 cycles per second. In most cases, brain waves with a frequency between 38Hz
and 50Hz are not considered for diagnosis. We can see more waves with a higher frequency
when the brain is actively processing information than when it is relaxed or daydreaming
[LK09]. Sometimes it is very hard to detect and understand brain activity patterns, even
for skilled and trained eyes. That is why brain waves nowadays are not only viewed and
interpreted in time domain, but also in frequency domain after spectrum analyses. There are
six common brain wave types: Delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma and mu waves. Table 2.1
shows a summary of the brain activity patterns. Figure 2.13 shows waveforms for some of
the presented brain activity patterns. [SC07]
Delta Waves

Delta waves range from 0.5Hz to 3.5Hz and are often found frontally in the brain. They
are very slow waves and present during deep sleep, but have also been found in awake

29

2 Background

state during relaxation or meditation [Ham07]. Delta waves normally have a relative high
amplitude and are easily confused with muscle activity from the jaw or the neck muscles.
This is due to the fact that strong muscles near the surface produce large signals. Delta
waves are also commonly found as dominant wave rhythms in babies.
Theta Waves

Theta waves range from 3.5Hz to 7.5Hz and are seen in arousal state or the changing process
from a conscious mental state to sleep. Theta waves show up when being relaxed or creative,
or when daydreaming or meditating. Stress, frustration or disappointment can cause higher
theta wave ratios. They are usually accompanied by other wave frequencies in the mid brain
and are more present in children than in adults. Children with attention deficit disorder
especially show a notably higher theta wave characteristic. Expert mediators are able to
consciously reproduce theta waves during exercise. [HGS06]

30

2.3 Neurofeedback

Figure 2.13: Sample waveforms for several brain activity patterns [SC07].
Alpha Waves

Alpha waves range from 7.5Hz to 12.0Hz and can be detected on both hemispheres in the
back of the brain. Mostly showing up as round, sinus shaped signals, alpha waves can also
be sharp and diffuse in the state of coma. They occur when we close our eyes and think
about something peaceful or calm. As soon as we open the eyes again, alpha waves decrease
or fully disappear again. That is why scientists think they are some kind of scanning pattern
of the brain regions responsible for visuals. No, or weak alpha waves were found when
being concentrated or when anxiety is felt with most people. Albert Einstein though, was
able to solve complex mathematical problems while having a high alpha wave ratio [SC07].
Alpha waves mostly have an amplitude less than 50µV.
Beta Waves

Beta waves range from 12.0Hz to 30.0Hz and are often further divided into low beta, medium
beta and high beta waves. Low beta waves indicate moderate mental activity, active, busy or
anxious thinking or concentration. Medium beta waves are present in high alertness state
or in case our mind is intensively thinking. Medium beta waves can be interfered by mu

waves as they share a part of the frequency band. High beta waves indicate stress, panic,
hyper awareness or anxiety. A high beta ratio generally means that information is being
processed and that the mind is awake. For example when solving mathematical problems
or when our mind’s focus is not in the inside, but on the outside world, many beta waves
are present. They mostly occur in central or frontal regions of the brain and are equally
distributed between the left and the right hemisphere. The amplitude mostly is less than
30µV. [ZCBD08]
Gamma Waves

Gamma waves range from 30.0Hz to around 50.0Hz and are related to consciousness. Beta,
as well as gamma waves are associated with attention, perception and cognition [RPC+ 02].
Waves with a frequency higher than 50Hz are rarely found and are indicators for brain
diseases. In some animals though, waves with frequencies ranging from 200Hz up to 300Hz
have been found. Gamma waves commonly have very small amplitudes and are sometimes
also related to motor functions in case several brain regions are working together.
Mu Waves

Mu waves range from 8.0Hz to 13.0Hz and thus overlap with the frequency range of alpha
and low beta waves. Mu waves are present when our body is idle. Mu waves show the same
kind of behavior as alpha waves when our eyes are closed. As soon as e.g. our hands rest
still, mu wave will become dominant and the motor neurons will recover. As mu waves lie
within alpha and low beta wave frequency ranges, they can be easily mixed up and have to
be filtered and assigned correctly for interpretation. [Swi08]

3 Related Work
Using the knowledge from the previous chapter about biofeedback and physiological sensors,
we will walk through case studies and other research projects from several related fields. We
will have a look at how biofeedback can be used for peak performance training in sports and
other mentally challenging areas. We will see how researchers from the gaming industry
used physiological sensors to improve gameplay and overall gaming experience. We will
have a look at physiological monitoring scenarios and medical biofeedback research in
health care. And lastly, we will talk about objects that can be controlled by our minds and
neuromarketing.

3.1 Peak Performance Biofeedback
World class performance cannot be achieved by physical strength alone. Physical performance, for example in sports, is closely related to mental and emotional strength. Athletes
that are able to keep optimal focus, and have control over their energy levels and their
emotional state, perform best. Biofeedback is more and more adopted in sport psychology.
Knowledge about the current emotional state in combination with body function recording
helps improving peak performance.
Only a few milliseconds of negligence might turn around a match or enable opportunities
for the opponents to score. Reaching the upper leagues of any kind of sport, opponents will
be all in a great physical condition. One of the last achievements for an athlete is to be able
to keep up his mental strength throughout a match. While physical strength already is at its
maximum, the own mind is the biggest threat and also an opportunity for gaining advantage
over the opponent. Peak performance requires full deployment of all powers and is hard to
keep up, especially under stressful conditions. Stress-reducing techniques like relaxation or
meditation, visualizations in order feed back score levels, and cognitive-behavioral strategies
are used for peak performance training.
Monitored physiological and psychological information from training sessions help detecting
influential moments. Heart rate, breathing rate, muscle tension, brain activity and other
information is gathered to get a clear picture of the athlete’s current state. Using biofeedback
techniques, moments where performance levels drop and the reason why can be evaluated
and filtered. After that, these influential situations can be trained specifically in order to
reach ideal body function levels. There are several techniques that can be used. One of them
is visualization, where athletes get distracted visually while training. By practicing with
individually chosen disturbance visualizations, the athlete can develop skills to perform

[JD10].
optimally while disregarding what disturbed him before. Another technique is breathing
patterns. Breathing patterns can be used to decrease heart rate which is especially important
for sports like golf or archery.
Olympic training centers in Colorado Springs and San Diego use biofeedback for peak
performance training. International competition, undue expectations and crowd pressure are
main disturbance factors for athletes. In the training centers, biofeedback is used to decrease
the influence of these factors and to stabilize emotional arousal.
Nada Jordanova and Aneta Demerdzieve did a case study in [JD10] showing that stress
is the major barrier to success. The study showed that the optimal state of mind for peak
performance is the so called »flow state«. In the flow state the athlete feels no fear, is aware
of all objectives, has a clear knowledge about his goals, concentrates on the task, is confident
and has a clear mind and optimal motivation. The study showed that arousal levels heavily
influences attention and that in stressful conditions like tournaments, attention is not at
optimal levels. In Figure 3.1 we can see that the athlete is inside the flow state and achieves
best performance with middle arousal levels.
Another peak performance biofeedback study with professional ballroom and Latin dancers
was made by Joshua Raymond [RSPG05]. Some of the dancers completed neurofeedback
and heart rate variability biofeedback sessions before training. Significant performance
improvements were found in dancers that did feedback sessions.
Ronald V. Croce investigated the effects of EMG biofeedback when acquiring muscle strength.
Two groups were formed. One group trained using biofeedback equipment and the other
one without. Training sessions were performed three times a week for five weeks. The
biofeedback group showed significantly greater levels in maximum force. [Cro86]
Especially sports which are known to be mentally challenging like golf or archery can benefit
from biofeedback. Researchers found out that archers perform better in case alpha waves are
dominant in the left hemisphere of the brain. Figure 3.2 shows two different brain activity
visualizations from a bad and a good shot. Biathletes that speed up their heart rate to a level
which is similar to when they are skiing show better results after training than without using
any feedback [ET11].

34

3.2 Biofeedback Gaming

Figure 3.2: Brain activity visualization of an archer doing a bad shot while his mind is busy
(left) and a good shot with a quiet mind (right) [ET11].
Peak performance biofeedback training in sports has a wide range of other use cases and
can be used to maximize the last bit out of every athlete. It has been used in swimming to
further increase speed of swimmers [BEDBW02]. It has been used to cope with pressure
and anxiety in basketball [PG12]. Musicians trained increasing alpha EEG band powers for
enhancing their musical performance [MRC81] as well as improving learning motivation
[BKK07].
Before we are going into biofeedback gaming in Section 3.2, we will close the gap by looking at a project from the NASA. The NASA developed a biofeedback technology called
»Mindshift«1 . Mindshift is a game used by astronauts for peak performance training to eliminate usually faced problems like fatigue, sleepiness, air sickness, anxiety and hypertension
[Uen00]. The emotional state and stress level are taken into account by the simulation.

3.2 Biofeedback Gaming
At the end of Section 3.1 we had a quick look at NASA’s peak performance gaming technology, whose main goal is to improve skill. This section will be about the gaming industry
and how they tried to use biofeedback to improve gameplay and increase fun. Video games
effect players emotionally. The alteration can be for example sensed by looking at the heart
rate. Basically all commercially available games do not link the emotional state of the player
with gameplay. [KLLJ10]
Affective video games that dynamically adopt to the player’s emotional state have been
researched by Kiel Mark Gilleade, Alan Dix and Jen Allanson in [GDA05]. Playing traditional

games, we respond to game-playing experience like emotionally-packed stories. In order
to increase affectivity, the study proposes several high level design heuristics: Assist me,
challenge me and emote me. Missing clues or too strong enemies can frustrate players.
They propose to measure frustration and assist players in problematic situations. Skill levels
vary between players, while degree of difficulty doesn’t. New ways of challenging bored
players need to be found to keep the advanced players engaged. In Figure 3.3, weather
conditions and boss speed change in case the player is too skilled. Heavy snowfall makes
it more difficult to aim and thus increases difficulty. Many games provide rich emotional
experiences. These can be improved by measuring the emotional level of the player and
further adjust the world, hold back given events or let an event kick in earlier.
In a speech at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco in 2011, Mike Ambinder
from Valve Software presented a study where they tried to improve game experience with
physiological sensors. They tried to map one dimensional data to on-screen actions and
game world adjustments. Derived arousal levels from for example a heart rate or a skin
conductance sensor was used for the mapping.
In their game »Left 4 Dead«, which is a cooperative first-person zombie shooter, they tie the
player arousal level to non-player characters (NPC) and to the difficulty of zombie encounters.
The NPCs’ skill and the number of spawned zombies is adjusted dynamically based on
arousal, in order prevent frustration. By getting access to arousal, gameplay and its intensity
can be adapted to the player’s experience and skill. In Figure 3.4, we can see an NPC called
»BioBinder« whose skill is based on the player arousal. There are moments where the player
needs to relax and just before getting bored new events have to kick in. Basically all testers
found the experience a lot more enjoyable and challenging, as the levels felt like they were
specially designed for them.
Valve Software did another study using eye trackers for their game »Portal 2«. Portal 2 is a
puzzle-based first-person shooter where traditionally the player uses a mouse for aiming.
Valve Software decouples player rotation from aiming in their study. The mouse is only used
for rotation here, while players aim using their eyes. Eye trackers are used to get the gaze
location as 2D screen coordinates. These are fed back into the game and the crosshair is
drawn at the given position. Testers see the decoupling as a plus and an evaluation showed
that it worked very well. [Amb11]

the player arousal level [Amb11].
A study on input devices for games showed that players preferred having a 1:1 mapping
for the main game object that often requires quick reactions to a presented stimulus. Direct
physiological sensors like a gamepad are preferred over input devices that cannot be
controlled fully consciously. Indirect sensors like for example a heart rate sensor are
perceived as slow and inaccurate and shall be only used to slowly change the environment
according to [NKLM11].

3.3 Physiological Monitoring
Mobile devices are convenient tools for patient monitoring inside hospitals or in everyday
life. Yuan-Hsiang Lin et al. developed a system for mobile patient monitoring that transfers
sensor data over a wireless network to a remote central. Authorized medical staff checks the
sent data while having access to additional information like the case history of the patient.
Wireless telemedicine can be life-saving for example when someone gets a heart attack. The
location of the person is known and the system transmits the emergency faster than any
person can phone an ambulance vehicle. [LJK+ 04]
Florian Alt, Alireza Sahami Shirazi and Prof. Dr. Albrecht Schmidt from the University of
Stuttgart developed an everyday life monitoring system that motivates increasing physical
activity. As for example the number of steps alone is not a significant indicator for physical
activity, heart rate, oxygen saturation and the number of steps have been used to calculate
an overall activity level. Making a user aware of his maybe too low physical activity level
per day and reminding him about it will motivate to increase physical activity. [ASS07]

Researchers from the Stanford University developed a lightweight, robust and easy to use
physiological monitoring device in collaboration with the NASA Ames Research Center
called »LifeGuard«. LifeGuard is a small, non-invasive device that is able to record vital data.
The recorded data can then be sent over to the Astrobionics NASA Research Center. The
system was intended for astronauts, but can also be used for home or clinical applications.
[MTT+ 04]
Noury et al. developed a smart fall sensor for increasing daily life security. Their sensor
monitors motion and activity of the wearer and selectively fires events through a wireless
network. For example if huge forces were detected and the sensor afterwards is oriented
parallel to the ground, something bad might have happened. [NHR+ 00]
Commercial physiological sensors from Zephyr have been used in a wide range of applications. Ultra-runner and endurance coach Tim Borland monitored himself while running a
marathon every day for two months. As this is a dangerous thing to do, Stacy Sims, an exercise physiologist from the Stanford University, evaluated data to help Tim Borland maintain
optimal health. The 32nd civil support team in Maryland got equipped with physiological
sensors while extracting samples of a nuclear material from a ship in Baltimore. The medical
officer continuously monitored the physical status of the team. This gives medical officers
the opportunity to see if a member of the team is not capable of bearing up with the high
workload in critical situations, especially when using a self-contained breathing apparatus.
Firefighters in New Zealand are monitored using physiological sensors in order to ensure
hydration and rest breaks in demanding situations. Ultimately, geographical information in
combination with vital data can save lives.2
Physiological monitoring has reached ubiquity with the invention of heart rate monitoring
applications for mobile phones. Two mobile heart rate monitoring applications can be seen
in Figure 3.5. It works by either placing the index finger onto the back camera and the LED,
that is used as streaker, or by just looking at one of the available cameras with the face. The
heart rate gets detected by extracting sensitive changes in skin color that emerge from blood
being pumped through our body.

3.4 Medical Case Studies and Biofeedback in Health Care
Thousands of experiments already have been done regarding effectiveness of biofeedback
and treatment prospects in health care. As the possibilities seem ceaseless, we will limit
ourselves to heart rate, skin temperature and EEG biofeedback in this section.
Learning to control our own heart rate is one of the most noticed topics for biofeedback
researchers. We have two prerequisites for learning heart rate control. First, we need
some kind of visual or audio feedback of the current heart rate. Second, we need some
instruction or goal for the participant like e.g. lift the feedback indicator line from the ground.

People can reliably learn to influence their heart rate using the described procedure [WB79].
Biofeedback training results are long-term abilities [LVV+ 09].
In 1977, researchers from the Johns Hopkins University of Medicine put heart rate sensors on
18 healthy people during exercise. In weekly sessions, participants had to do five 10-minute
trials of walking. Eight of them got a heart rate sensor connected to a biofeedback system
during the sessions. The participants that were using the biofeedback systems got instructed
to try to lower their heart rates. The mean heart rate of the group using biofeedback was
around 12 beats per minute lower. [GRB77]
Another study was done by Christopher F. Sharpley in 1989. He investigated the effectiveness
of cardiac education in combination with feedback methods. 36 students participated, half
of them were control subjects. Half of the group had an awareness training upfront were
they learned techniques to increase or decrease their heart rate, even in stressful conditions.
The group who had the training successfully lowered their heart rate in the actual study.
Though, the control group also managed to lower their heart rate when they were told to get
a monetary reward. [Sha89]

A success story for patients with known coronary artery disease took place in San Diego
in 2004. Over 50 participants with a mean age of 67 years were chosen for the study. A
conventional therapy was given to a control group while others did biofeedback sessions in
order to increase their heart rate variability. For the first six weeks there were no differences
found between the two groups. Though, after the 18th week the biofeedback group showed
significant increases in their heart rate variability. [PGSG04]
Edward Blanchard et al. tested several groups if feedback response actually increases the
learning curve when trying to learn to control the heart rate. The learning rates of several
groups were compared. One group didn’t get any kind of feedback. Another group did see
their heart rate as visual feedback and the last one got incorrect feedback. The comparison
showed that the group which got correct feedback showed trends for increasing their heart
rate control. [BSYE74]
Though there are several studies that showed an increase of heart rate control abilities in the
mean values, success when using biofeedback is not guaranteed to be clinically significant.
Some subjects in basically all the studies showed substantial heart rate changes, but there
were always some that were not able to take clinically significant control of it. The variability
of some of the results was quite high, even if the means showed successful values. Increasing
heart rate seems to be easier to learn, while the effect was even more inconsistent when
trying to decrease it. The fact that participants improved their skills the more training
sessions they completed on the other side shows that there certainly is a way to learn to
maximize the effect of heart rate control. [WB79]
In a biofeedback study at the Ohio University, Francis J. Keefe and E. Ty Gardener showed
that control over finger temperature can be learned. A group was able to increase their
skin temperature up to 1.4 ◦ C relative to the base temperature, while decreasing worked
up to a relative 1.6 ◦ C. The subjects showed significant ability increases within the first
three days. However, no further improvements were seen in a long-term training after that
[KG79]. Another study from Francis J. Keefe showed that skin temperature control can also
be learned by instructing participants, even without feedback. Results from both methods
could be reproduced by the subjects two weeks after training. [Kee78]
Skin temperature biofeedback training has been successfully used to decrease Migraine
headaches [GBAD81].
In another study, Richard S. Surwit tried to decrease the effects of patients suffering from
Raynaud’s desease. The Raynaud’s phenomenon bleaches finders, toes and other areas due
to excessively reduced blood flow. Feeling cold and increased emotional stress are further
symptoms. In the study, participants received autogenic instructions and skin temperature
feedback. Reliable skin temperature increases were produced. [SF80]
Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease where the own immune system fights against the body’s
tissues mistakenly. The result is a chronic inflammation of the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis
is believed to be caused by stress. Biofeedback and relaxation techniques were successfully
used to decrease symptoms by learning to increase skin temperature. The healing factor
though was not the psychological enhancement the subjects gained, but only the physical
fact of a warmer temperature. [MAL81]

3.5 Neuromarketing

A clinical study from Thomas Fuchs et al. showed that attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) can be effectively treated using neurofeedback. In order to compare
the findings, a control group was formed. Subjects in the control group took medication
that reduces mu and beta wave activity and is normally used to treat ADHD. After three
months of neurofeedback sessions, the control group that took medication as well as the
neurofeedback group, showed significant decreases in behavior related to the disorder. The
changes led to better brain regulation and improvements in attention, mood and social
behavior. [FBL+ 03]
Epilepsy medicine is another possible candidate that could be replaced with neurofeedback
training. Treatment of epilepsy with mu wave training using a multi-electrode EEG has
been successfully used. Measures are checked against a normative database before and after
treatment in order to normalize the EEG oscillation. Subjects showed significant increases
in control of their mu waves. Neurofeedback is claimed to be more than an alternative to
pharmacotherapy. [SE06]
In a study from Elsa Baehr et al., depression was successfully treated using neurofeedback.
Six subjects received several neurofeedback sessions. Three of them were diagnosed with
depression. After training, all subjects reached the criteria for the non-depressed range and
remained in that state over time. [BRB01]

3.5 Neuromarketing
»Neuromarketing is an emerging field that bridges the study of consumer behavior with
neuroscience« [Mor11]. Since the idea of hacking people’s heads and search the buy button
emerged first in 2002, neuromarketing gets more and more attention. Earlier, marketers tried
to determine arousal levels by pupil dilation to check and see how interested people are in
their products, when looking at advert ideas and prototype commercials. They have also
tried galvanic skin response and eye tracking in order to sense emotional response to their
marketing ideas. The logical next step were brain scanners. In neuromarketing, brain activity
is checked while people watch adverts with the aim to predict what products they would buy
[Sut07]. A system that reads user thoughts and automatically adds notes to time segments
on a video timeline has been developed by Alireza Sahami Shirazi et al. [SFP+ 12].
Marketing clients want to know if their commercials will work or not, or if their product will
be bought or not. There is a big chance that neuroscientists will deliver increasingly powerful
marketing insights, but research needs to be done. Marketers need to work together closely
with neuroscientists in order to be able to make accurate predictions [But08].
Currently, there are four main issues in neuromarketing and neuroscience in general. Mirror
neurons simulate the outside world, goals and intention of others. It is impossible to specify
if brain activity is generated by mirror neurons or not. Experiences can change the structure
of our brains. It might be that activity at a given location of a subject might mean something
completely different when testing with another subject. We develop our abilities mostly
in our childhood. Marketers do not know yet if brand loyalty and purchasing habits are

acquired in early life as well. It is also unknown how much decision making is based on
rational thoughts and how much on emotional response. [PP08]
All marriages of two academic fields are not easy. Though there is a big chance that
neuromarketing will result in important discoveries. [Mor11]

3.6 Mind-Controlled Objects
Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) can be used to bring a bit of freedom back to people that are
paralyzed and locked in a wheelchair. Figure 3.6 shows a wheelchair that is mind-controlled.
Brain activity is recorded with a BCI, analyzed and translated into commands like move
forward, move backward, turn left or turn right. It is easier to only differentiate between
a given amount of event based commands, rather than extracting information of how fast
the person wants to drive or what angle the turn should be. Additional sensors scan the
surrounding area and smartly execute the commands by figuring out how to follow the
command without hitting anything. Other than obstacle detection to avoid crashes, the
software e.g. also understands if the person wants to drive to a given object, like a table. After
some time of training, the user can drive the wheelchair close to perfectly. Studies showed
that drive command differentiation works best, when the user imagines hand movement or
does mathematical exercises. [RGZ+ 10]
After a study from Andrew B. Schwartz et al., two monkeys were able to feed themselves
with a robotic arm by just thinking. A brain-computer interface in combination with a
neural prosthetic was used for the experiment. Brain activity is recorded and transferred
to a processing unit which translates the signals into operations. The extracted control
signal gets passed to a robotic controller that moves a prosthetic arm. In order to close the
feedback loop, the prosthetic arm provides the monkeys with so called somatosensation
feedback. Somatosensational feedback is using the neuromuscular system of the user that

is still working to transmit information about the physical state of the robotic arm. If the
system is going to be used on humans is uncertain. It depends on if performance is perceived
as good enough, if costs won’t be too high and last but most important, if the system is safe
and reliable. Especially for safety and reliability, better extraction algorithms still have to be
developed. [SCWM06]
In Figure 3.7, we can see a robot called roboPix. roboPix draws action paintings based on
user thoughts and the emotional state. An Emotiv EPOC is used to sense brain activity
and move the robot based on sensed information. Previously recorded and later recognized
thoughts, as well as the currently sensed emotional state are used to control the system
and give the painting a unique look. The project was sponsored by the German Research
Foundation and has been developed by Markus Funk and Michael Raschke at the University
of Stuttgart. [FR13]
A brain-controlled quadcopter was developed by Professor Bin He and his research team at
the University of Minnesota. Using an EEG with 64 electrodes, their robotic quadcopter drone
can be controlled in three-dimensional physical space, by using the same kind of mapping
techniques as in the wheelchair and prosthetic arm experiments. Possible controls are: Move
left, right, up, down, forward and backward. The quadcopter gets control commands via
WiFi and has a built-in, front-facing camera as feedback for the pilot. Five subjects learned
to fly the drone by imagining to open and close their fists. Imagining to close the left fist
gives the quadcopter the command to move left and vice versa. Imagining to close both fists
will make the drone go up and imagining to release pressure will make it go down again.
The subjects first trained in a virtual environment before actually flying the quadcopter. The
objective consisted of flying through two big balloon rings while only seeing through the
front-facing camera. All five subjects successfully and accurately flew through the obstacle
course. [LCD+ 13]

4 The Biofeedback Project
Any sufficiently advanced
technology is indistinguishable from
magic.
(Arthur C. Clarke)

This chapter is the essence of the thesis. We will have a look at the goals of the project and
the approach used in order to achieve them. Next, we will get a rough overview of the
system and the software architecture before going into the details.
The following sections are divided into three parts. First, we will have a look at how
to acquire data from physiological sensors and how to manage the sensed data. After
that, we will have a look at the dynamic classification system that got developed for the
thesis in order to translate data from physiological sensors into self-defined feedback scores.
The last part will be about feedback visualization. We will explain how we created the
virtual environments, how users can interact with them and how we visualize data from
physiological sensors.

4.1 Overview
The goal of this thesis is to develop a flexible biofeedback framework that can be used for
future projects, as well as a fully operational biofeedback system. It is designed to be a
mash-up of biofeedback, modern physiological sensors and 3D technology.
Users are able to learn to increase body control or endure given situations better, by training
with a biofeedback system that brings analyzed data from physiological sensors back into
the scenario as visually represented real-time feedback. The biofeedback framework is able
to handle multiple physiological sensors simultaneously. It is easy to add new sensors to the
framework.
A visualization unit creates given atmospheres by displaying 3D scenes and allows users to
interact with it. Navigating around the scene as well as modifying it using sensed data from
physiological sensors are part of the human-computer interaction.
The software is responsible for communicating with physiological sensors as well as sending
the analyzed and prepared data to the training visualization. Next to the training visualization, raw and analyzed data is visualized in a scientific way, in order to understand the level
of effectiveness and to be able to influence and control the training procedure.

Data classification happens one level above signal processing. Our classifiers use data
provided by physiological sensors and translate them into meaningful feedback score values.
These feedback score values are then used for visualization. The software is flexible enough
to later be used as base for all kinds of biofeedback applications.
After lots of reading and research, the first thing we did was designing an overview sketch
of the system. Based on the rough system sketch and sample interfaces of the used SDKs, we
designed a more detailed software architecture before starting with the implementation.
For a first prototype, everything that was not essential got excluded. Iterative prototyping
was used after a fundamental version was working. With each cycle, code refactoring,
bug fixes and performance optimization were handled. A revision control system was
used throughout development in order to be able to revert bad design changes or newly
introduced bugs.

46

4.2 Feedback System

4.2 Feedback System
The system we developed for this project is an extended version of the traditional biofeedback
loop. The traditional biofeedback loop consists of a user and a biofeedback device, where
the biofeedback device provides the user with sensed information and thus closes the loop
[MNP+ 07].
Our feedback system contains four main entities: Two computers, a human user and a
human feedback controller. Several physiological sensors get attached to the user, providing
our system with the sensed information. The user either looks at a screen or wears a virtual
reality headset while receiving visual and audio feedback in a meaningful and easy to
understand way. The feedback controller person sees raw data from physiological sensors in
a scientific visualization. Next to viewing sensed information, the feedback controller can
also adjust the used classifier and interfere the feedback loop.
The machine seen on the lower right in Figure 4.1 is called visualization tier. It either renders
a visualization on screen or displays a virtual environment on a VR headset. The scene needs
to be rendered twice for the VR headset, once for each eye using a perspective projection
that matches the used lenses. Next to visuals, the visualization tier also provides audio
feedback to the user. In order to ensure a realistic experience for the user, head orientation is
synchronized with camera orientation.
The unit left of the visualization tier is called analyzing tier. It is used for acquisition,
analysis and scientific visualization. Data from physiological sensors is sent to, acquired and
stored by the analyzing tier. Incoming data gets classified and translated into custom and
meaningful score values. Raw data from sensors, as well as classifiers and score values are
visualized in a real-time application for the feedback controller. The feedback controller can
influence the classifier while training is active. He is also able to influence feedback scores
based on skill and mood of the user.
As both, the analyzing tier as well as the visualization tier are real-time applications, we
have separated them in order to achieve optimal performance. The visualization tier already
needs two full render passes for stereoscopic rendering while a single pass of a complex
3D scene can already bring a high-end machine to its knees. The visualization tier needs
to render multiple real-time widgets, which is a heavy process on its own because of the
context switches, even when not showing complex 3D scenes. Though running both tiers on
a single unit is possible, it results in quite a big performance trade-off.
Due to the split into the analyzing and the visualization tier, we need to define a way
how the two tiers communicate with each other. Figure 4.2 shows a flowchart describing
the communication model. The analyzing tier regularly sends broadcast messages to the
network. Visualization units can respond to these with an XML data message in order to
register themselves at the analyzing tier. Contents of the XML data message are the IP
address of the visualization tier, the available levels, games or visualization environments
and a unique message identifier.

Figure 4.2: A flowchart describing the way, how the analyzing tier communicates with the
visualization tier.
The analyzing tier registers the visualization tier into a list of clients after parsing the XML
data message. The analyzing tier feeds the visualization tier in a real-time process with
the latest feedback scores around 30 times per second. We use the UDP protocol in our
implementation as reliability is not the highest priority in this case. It doesn’t matter if one
message gets lost in the network, due to the fact that the next message holding updated
feedback values is reaching soon afterwards.

4.3 Software Architecture
In this section, we will have a look at the software architecture for the analyzing tier. We
developed the software in Visual Studio 2012 on Windows 8.1 using C++. The cross-platform
application framework Qt 5 is used for user interfaces and network communication.
In Figure 4.3, we can see the packages that work together in the analyzing tier. We have split
the upper packages into a separately compiled library, which can be used independently
as framework for other biofeedback applications, while the lower packages are present in
the application itself. The »Core« package consists of a set of container classes, a logging
helper class, a custom string implementation, a timer class, a unique identification number
generator, file system helper functions, a keyframing system and a flexible attribute system.
The keyframing system will be further discussed in Section 4.4.2. We’ll also have a closer
look at the attribute system in Section 4.5.3.

48

4.3 Software Architecture

Figure 4.3: Global dependencies diagram of the developed packages.
Next up is »Bio Core«, which is based on the »Core« package and extends it with functionality
needed for biofeedback applications and physiological sensors. It holds a device framework
allowing multiple sensors for a given device, as well as multiple devices for a given system
type. It has been designed in a way that it will be very easy to add custom signal processing as
well as new physiological sensors. »Bio Core« is closely related to the »Devices« package. The
»Devices« package contains the actual acquisition implementation for specific physiological
sensors. An insight view into the »Bio Core« and »Devices« packages is given in Figure
4.4.
»Bio Core« holds data structures for feedback values and sessions, a data importer and
exporter, color mapping functionality and specialized helpers for neurofeedback applications
like a 10-20 system helper class. It also contains a neuro sensor class which is inherited from
the base sensor. The biggest part of the package though is its graph system. The graph
system is used for creating, editing and processing classifiers and will be further discussed
in Section 4.5.2.
The application itself is divided into three packages which all rely on the libraries that we
just walked through. »Qt Base« is the user interface equivalent to »Core«. It contains tools
and helpers on which the application is based on, like a dock window, a dialog stack or
custom widgets like button groups, color labels, custom spinboxes, link widgets or sliders
with a linked spinbox next to them. It also contains a plugin system which is used for every
window in the application. Dock widgets in combination with our plugin and layout system
allow a flexible user interface and interface customization. An attribute widget factory that is

able to create custom attribute widgets for each of the user independent attributes in »Core«,
allows completely dynamic interfaces.
The »Plugins« package is a set of plugin implementations, each representing a docking
window in the application. The »Studio« unit is the application itself. It holds a main window
and refers to the set of plugins that are automatically loaded based on the individually

4.4 Data Acquisition
In this section, we will talk about how to acquire data from physiological sensors, how to
store it and how to access it in an efficient way again. Data in our case can either be results
from hardware built-in signal processing units or raw samples. We will walk through devices
that we used within this project and their specifications. Lastly, we will have a look at how
to manage our sampled data.

4.4.1 Used Hardware
Before we deal with data management, we will have a look at the used physiological sensors.
The software architecture has been designed in a way, that it is very easy to add new
physiological sensors as well as to support multiple sensors simultaneously in real-time. As
there are several sensors out in the market, we decided to pick the ones that are easy to
mount and take off again, don’t disturb too much while wearing, preferably are wireless
and ship with a software development kit.
Zephyr BioHarness 3

BioHarness 3 is a compact physiological monitoring device developed by Zephyr Technology
(see Figure 4.5). The device is based on a computing and a connectivity module. The
connectivity module is attached to a wearable strap that is placed around the chest. The strap
contains the actual physiological sensors and communicates with the computing unit. The
computing module has built-in signal processing and is able to send resulting information
over Bluetooth or stores data internally. Due to Bluetooth compatibility, it can be used with

Supported recording techniques are electrocardiography, pneumography, skin temperature
and acceleration measurement. This means that BioHarness 3 can output heart rate, heart
rate variability, breathing rate and skin temperature. Internal algorithms that use data from
the accelerometer and an event system are able to detect jumps, falls and other activity. In
Table 4.3, detailed specifications of the BioHarness 3 are summarized.
For BioHarness 3, we created an implementation using our device and device system classes
as specified in Figure 4.4. The device implementation holds sensors for heart rate, heart
rate variability, raw heart rate amplitude, breathing rate, raw breathing rate amplitude, skin
temperature, activity and posture. The information is extracted from Bluetooth messages
that the BioHarness 3 sensor fires and is then fed to our internal representation.
In Figure 4.6, the BioHarness 3 plugin is depicted. The upper left area shows the current
heart rate and an animated heart icon. The heart icon is animated with the speed of the
current heart rate and changes accordingly with it. Right of the heart rate, we can see
the heart rate variability. It takes a while until the heart rate variability is shown as it is
calculated based on multiple intervals. The breathing rate is shown on the lower left, while
the skin temperature is displayed on the lower right. Left of the value representing skin
temperature, we can see an animated thermometer widget. The battery on the bottom left,

NeuroSky MindWave Mobile

NeuroSky’s MindWave Mobile is a wireless and non-invasive brain-computer interface for
consumers (see Figure 4.7). It has one passive dry sensor, a ground and reference sensor and
thus is a single channel EEG. More information about the EEG in general can be found in
Section 2.3.2. MindWave Mobile is powered by an AAA battery and lasts for about 10 hours.
An SDK is available for iOS, Android, Windows and OSX. Due to Bluetooth connectivity
and an open message format, the BCI can be connected to any platform.
The integrated ThinkGear chipset analyses the sensed signal and translates it into more
meaningful values such as attention, meditation and eye blink strength. It also provides
access to the magnitude of several brain activity patterns. Supported patterns are: Delta,
theta, low alpha, high alpha, low beta, high beta and gamma. The ThinkGear chipset is
a complete signal processing system on a chip that is connected to the dry electrode. In
order to extract the data that we just walked through, the ThinkGear system contains an
analog-to-digital converter, an amplifier and noise and interference filters.
Mapping the electrode of the MindWave sensor arm to the 10-20 system is ambiguous
because the arm can be rotated freely to either the F3 or the Fp1 position.

4.4 Data Acquisition

Figure 4.8: The active neuro headset and raw waveform plugins rendering real-time data
coming from a NeuroSky MindWave Mobile.
Following the software architecture, we have implemented a device and a device system
class for NeuroSky’s MindWave Mobile. The implemented NeuroSky device gets updated
along with each real-time event. Inside the event, we’re using the ThinkGear communication
driver provided by NeuroSky to check if there are any messages waiting from the BCI. In
case there are messages in the waiting queue, we walk over them, check the latest values
of the sensors against the new incoming ones and add samples in case they changed. The
BCI provides different information at different sample rates. For example the meditation
and attention values are updated each second, while the raw signal comes in 512 times per
second.
The NeuroSky system implementation is responsible for the connection to the BCI. It creates
a new connection id, sets the stream and data logs and connects to the device through the
given COM port. After connection got established successfully, the system will automatically
create a NeuroSky device.
In Figure 4.8 we can see the active neuro headset and raw waveform plugins from the
analyzing tier. The left shows the location of sensors the currently plugged in BCI supports,
according to the 10-20 system. The right shows raw data recorded by the dry electrode in
real-time. By pressing the gear icon at the top right corner, time and amplitude scale can be
changed along with a few other settings.

4.4.2 Data Management
Each device can be teared down into multiple, one-dimensional sensors. Each sensor instance
in software holds a container, where we can store samples coming from the actual hardware
sensor. The container needs to store samples in an efficient way, in order to be able to deal
with a large amount of incoming data.

55

4 The Biofeedback Project
Keyframing System

BCI electrodes spawn sensed values with high sampling rates. NeuroSky’s MindWave Mobile
for example fires 512 raw values per second. The Emotiv EPOC fires with a sample rate
of 128 while having 16 electrodes. This sums up to 2048 samples per second from a single
physiological sensor while only taking raw values into account.
We decided to develop a keyframing system in order to deal with the large amount of
incoming samples. A keyframe is considered as any variable whose value is set at a given
time, while we can interpolate between two of these [Par02]. Interpolation requires fast access
to random keyframes and will be useful for generating statistics as well as for classification.
Memory allocations are very slow operations and should be avoided, especially in real-time
environments [Ger02]. In order to minimize the amount of allocations, we do not resize our
container with each incoming sample, but prevent allocations by directly resizing to 125% of
the current size of the container. With a current number of 1000 samples, we prevent any
allocation the next 250 samples that way. And as physiological sensors fire with different
sample rates, allocations are even distributed along the update calls.
Data Access and Interpolation

We have two ways of accessing samples in our keyframing system. One is direct access via
the keyframe index, and the other is to get access to an interpolated value based on a given
time. Before we can calculate the interpolated value, we need to know the two keyframes
that are located directly next to our given time value. In order to determine a random start
key index efficiently based on a time value, we can either use a bisection algorithm or an
interpolation search. As keyframes are sorted in time, are fairly uniformly distributed but
might not be always distanced equally, interpolation search performs best [Wei00]. Both
methods are iterative ways. Using interpolation search, we make an accurate guess of where
the sample might be, rather than just always take the middle like when using binary search.
The applicable formula to determine a guess for the next iteration is shown in Equation
4.1.
x − samples[low]
(4.1) next = low +
× (high − low − 1)
samples[high] − samples[low]




The complexity of binary search is O(log N ). Interpolation search has a slightly better
complexity of O(log log N ). Though, this can make a huge impact when dealing with many
keyframes like in our case. For N = 4.000.000.000, log N is about 32 while log log N is
roughly only 5. We have implemented interpolation search into our keyframing system in
order to increase runtime performance for rendering multiple brain waves as well as statistics
generation. For example, rather than iterating through the whole 20 minutes of sample data,
we just down-sample the whole wave by iterating through it with a bigger time delta.
In the following section, we will have a look at further processing the acquired data.

56

4.5 Analysis

Figure 4.9: Classifier plugin showing a classification graph as well as helper windows
showing feedback score interface elements, attributes of the selected node and
the available classifiers.

4.5 Analysis
This section is all about the system that enables us to combine measured values from
physiological sensors in order to translate them into self-defined feedback score values that
can be mapped to visual or audio feedback. We will have a look at data classification at
one meta layer above signal processing, so based on the results from signal processing. We
will begin with the flexible and dynamic graph system that we developed for classification,
show how the system works internally and how to create and edit custom classifiers. We
will explain how classifiers are traversed and lastly, we will walk through the available node
types.

4.5.1 Classification
Classification is the actual mapping process from physiological sensor information to feedback score values that will be used by the visualization tier. Modern physiological sensors
like BioHarness 3, NeuroSky MindWave Mobile or Emotiv Insight all have their own signal
processing units, either built in hardware directly or implemented in software in the API or
drivers that ship along with sensors. We decided to develop a fully editable graph system
for defining classifiers.

57

4 The Biofeedback Project

4.5.2 Graph System
Visual editing makes it easy to create new classifiers and to debug and tweak them in
real-time. For every physiological sensor, we created a node with several output ports.
Each sensor channel and each resulting value from the sensor’s built-in signal processing
is represented as an output port of the node. There is a wide range of nodes available that
enables us to e.g. add or multiply values, remap intervals, get the current training time in
seconds, average values, set conditions, apply Boolean operations or smooth values over time.
We will have a detailed look into what node types are available in the following sections.
We can link two nodes via data connections by using drag and drop from an output port to
an input port of another node. New nodes can be created using a context menu that appears
when clicking the right button on the mouse. We can translate nodes by selecting them and
then move them around while holding the left mouse button. To delete nodes, select them
and either use the context menu or press the delete button.
Classifiers are actually no generic graphs, rather they are trees with sensors as leaf nodes
and score nodes as root nodes. The system behind though is designed as generic graph,
so that we later on can reuse it for other purposes. When calculating score values for
the visualization tier, we traverse the tree bottom-up in level-order. Inputs for traversal
calculations are the output ports of child nodes, seen on the right of each node. The actual
values are stored in the input port of the parent node. We can access given values by port
numbers stored within the connections. The results of the calculation for a given node are
then stored within the input ports seen on the left of each node.
The graph holds a list of nodes and root nodes. Root nodes in our case are the score nodes.
Each of the nodes holds a set of input connections, input ports and output ports. Inside the
ports, current values for calculations are stored. Each node also holds visual information like
the node position, whether it is collapsed or not, the node information and also temporal
tree traversal flags, like if the node has already been updated or not in the current iteration.
Each node also holds a set of dynamic attributes used for adjusting its behavior. We will
have a further look at attributes and how they are used within the graph in Section 4.5.3.
A screenshot of a rendered classifier along with the manipulation interface can be seen in
Figure 4.9. The graph is rendered and animated in real-time using OpenGL and Qt.

4.5.3 Attributes System
The graph system has been designed in a way that allows us to easily add new nodes without
needing to hard-code interfaces for each of them. The reason why we need interfaces for
nodes is that each node has different settings and we want to customize these. We wanted to
have the user interface to automatically adopt to unique attributes of the current selected
node. In order to achieve that, we developed a dynamic and flexible attribute system, that
can be used to describe properties for all types of objects and directly provides interfaces to
adjust them. We have based our system on the work of Charles Cafrelli, who has published
a basic property class in [BKD+ 01].

58

4.5 Analysis

Figure 4.10: Nodes for the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile (left) and the BioHarness 3 (right)
sensors.
The attribute system consists of two main parts. The actual attribute information and its
corresponding custom GUI widget. Each node holds an attribute set which is an array of
attributes and additional information like a minimum and maximum value, a default value,
a name and description, and the type of interface to use in order to represent the attribute
visually.
For each attribute type, we created an attribute widget, which is the visual representation of
the attribute using Qt. Each attribute widget is registered at a globally accessible attribute
widget factory. When selecting a given graph node, we walk through the attributes in the
attribute set of the node and let the attribute factory construct an attribute widget for each
attribute. All attribute widgets are then put into some table or tree widget and form a
dynamic interface for any type of object.
In Figure 4.9, an example of how our dynamic interface looks in the »Classifier Node
Attributes« window is shown on the right.

4.5.4 Sensor Nodes
Sensor nodes (see Figure 4.10) are always leaf nodes as they don’t have any input ports.
Sensor nodes represent any kind of physiological sensor that has been implemented into
the framework. They communicate with the internal device and sensor data and enable
access for classification via the output ports of the nodes. It is easy to add new sensor nodes
when adding a physiological sensor to the framework, as other than linking sensors from
the device to output ports, everything is handled automatically.
NeuroSky MindWave Mobile Node

The NeuroSky MindWave Mobile node has ten output ports. First of all we have the raw
data output, which is the voltage the electrode measures in µV. Then we have results from
the internal signal processing unit, attention, meditation and blink strength. And lastly the

59

4 The Biofeedback Project

Figure 4.11: Available source node types.
NeuroSky node gives us access to several frequency band powers: Delta, low alpha, high
alpha, low beta, high beta, low gamma and high gamma.
BioHarness 3 Node

The BioHarness 3 node has output ports for heart rate, heart rate variability and heart rate
amplitude. Other than providing heart information, the node also has output ports for
breathing rate and the measured breathing rate amplitude, skin temperature, activity and
posture. Activity is a value that tells us how quickly the user is accelerating and moving
his body. Posture represents an angle that tells us how straight the person is standing or
sitting.

4.5.5 Source Nodes
Source nodes (see Figure 4.11) are leaf nodes that only have output ports. In contrast to
sensor nodes, output values of source nodes are dynamically calculated and don’t represent
values measured by any of our connected physiological sensors.
Constant Float Node

The constant float node holds one output port and one attribute where we can define a
floating point value. The output port gets mapped to user defined value. The constant float
node is basically just a visual representation of a floating point value.
Session Time Node

The session time node outputs the current time in seconds since start of the training session.
In case no training session is active, the node outputs a value of 0.0. This node can be handy
to dynamically increase difficulty based on how long the user has already trained.

60

4.5 Analysis

Figure 4.12: Available math node types.
Sinus Oscillator

The sinus oscillator node holds two attributes. The first attribute stores the number of cycles
per second which internally is multiplied by two π. A value of 1.0 means its doing one cycle
per second. The second attribute holds the amplitude of the sine wave. This node has mostly
been used for debugging purposes while developing the classification system.

4.5.6 Math Nodes
Math nodes (see Figure 4.12) enable us to combine data from different physiological sensors
and translate them into new meaningful score values. They are the base of the classification
system and allow us to visually represent any mathematical formula.
Math 1 Node

The math 1 node has one input and one output port. We can feed a floating point value
to this node and get a single output value. Using a combo box in the attributes window,
we √
can select the function to use within our node. Available options are: sin x, cos x, tan x,
x2 , x, | x |, d x e, b x c, 1x , ln x, log x, arcsin x, arccos x and arctan x. Other than standard math
functions, it can also output a random floating point value, the sign of the input value or
convert the input value from radians to degrees and vice versa.
Math 2 Node

We can bring two values together using the math 2 node. The math 2 node has two input
ports and one output port. Available math functions are: x + y, x − y, x ∗ y, yx , min( x, y),
max( x, y), x mod y and x y . The first input port (x) needs to be connected, while the second
(y) is optional. The node holds a static value attribute that is used as y in case the second
input port is not connected.

61

4 The Biofeedback Project

Figure 4.13: Available logic node types.
Smoothing Node

The smoothing node delays the value for a bit and smoothly interpolates the value from the
last frames to the new input value of the current frame. It can be used to calm down the
visualization in case a value from a physiological sensor is highly unstable. The interpolation
speed as well as a start value can be set in the attributes. An interpolation speed of 0.0 means
the value won’t change at all and 1.0 means the input value will directly be mapped to the
output value. The closer to 0.0 the interpolation speed is, the more the value lags behind.
Range Remapper Node

The range remapper node can be used to map any set of real numbers in a given range to
another interval. It has one input port and one output port. The minimum and maximum
input values, so the input interval, can be set in the node’s attributes. In case the incoming
value is smaller (greater) than the minimum (maximum) value set in the attributes, it gets
clipped to the lower (higher) bound of the output. As shown in Equation 4.2, simple linear
conversion is used to map the input value to the output range.

(4.2)

x − minInput
∗ (maxOutput − minOutput) + minOutput
maxInput − minInput

Average Node

The average node has six input ports. It accumulates the values from the input ports and
divides the accumulated value by the number of plugged-in connections. If an input port is
not connected, it won’t be taken into account by the calculation.

4.5.7 Logic Nodes
The logic nodes (see Figure 4.13) can be used to set simple conditions or choose what values
are forwarded to the output ports. They can be used to create different graph traversal paths
based on specific sensor values.

62

4.5 Analysis

Figure 4.14: The feedback score node.
Switch Node

The switch node has six input ports and one output port. Five of the input ports are used
as possible candidates for forwarding their value. The other one is a decision value. The
decision value chooses the input port to forward. In case a floating point value is used as
decision index, the value gets floored. The valid decision value range is [0.0, 5.0[. Decision
values outside the given range are clamped.
Float Condition Node

The float condition node has two input ports and two output ports. It can be used for simple
value comparison checks like =, <, >, ≤ or ≥. Using float condition nodes we can check if
one of our values is inside a given range, use the result as Boolean scores, pass them forward
to bool logic nodes or just put math nodes behind it to further adjust the output value.
Bool Logic Node

The bool logic node basically works the same way as the float condition node. Rather than
comparing floating point values, we use the input as Boolean values and apply Boolean
L
operations like ∧, ∨ or
on them. Using bool logic nodes in combination with condition
and math nodes, we can basically create any possible formula visually.

4.5.8 Score Node
Score nodes (see Figure 4.14) are always root nodes. Each score node only has one input
port. The value that the score node receives is transmitted to the visualization tier and is
then used for feedback visualization. Valid input values for the score node have to lie within
[0.0, 1.0]. Values smaller or bigger are clamped to a valid value. The user interface of the
application changes according to the number of score nodes. Each score node has its own
visual feedback score slider in the user interface. The feedback sliders can be seen in Figure
4.9 at the top right window.
Score nodes also calculate game points. The number of game points is our non-relative
value that can be used to compare results between users after completing training sessions.
Score nodes evaluate game points each second by using discrete integration. Score values of
keyframes from the last second are used to calculate rectangles for each of the time steps.

63

4 The Biofeedback Project

The area is accumulated and in the end multiplied with the points multiplier attribute of
the score node. The points multiplier can be set individually per score node and is used to
adjust the number of points that is given per second for a theoretical maximum feedback
score of 1.0.
The discrete integration formula used to approximate game points over time is shown in
Equation 4.3.

4.6 Visualization
In this section, we will walk through technologies and visualization techniques that we used
for feedback training visualization.
We will describe how we integrated the technologies with the analyzing tier and how the
visualizations are controlled. Lastly, we will walk over the actual visualizations that we have
developed for the user evaluation.

4.6.1 Used Technologies
The rendering engine as well as the virtual reality head-mounted display that we used for
creating virtual reality experiences, will be introduced in this section.
Unity 4 Engine

Unity is a cross platform 3D game engine. It contains a rendering system that can use
either OpenGL or Direct X. Unity can import assets from a wide range of 3D modelling
software like Blender, Maya, 3ds Max or Cinema 4D. Imported objects can be arranged and

put together to whole scenes inside the Unity Editor shown in Figure 4.15. The engine has
built-in systems for audio, physics, artificial intelligence and special effects.
Unity is fully scriptable and uses the open source .NET platform called Mono. »Mono is a
software platform designed to allow developers to easily create cross platform applications«1 .
Mono provides a Common Language Runtime for C# standard libraries on other platforms,
making it possible to e.g. use C# networking scripts on iOS and Android devices. JavaScript,
C# and Boo are supported scripting languages.
The Unity engine has a big community and offers tutorials and other documentation
sources.
Next to Unity, we have also evaluated two open-source engines, the irrlicht engine2 and the
Ogre engine3 . We created demo visualizations that communicate with the analyzing tier and
render simple feedback score representations. Both, irrlicht and Ogre are capable engine
candidates, but we think Unity is superior for rapid prototyping. We have chosen to use
Unity, as we were able to create a prototype with it quickly, that includes many advanced
effects which aren’t easy to implement manually.
Oculus Rift

The Oculus Rift is a virtual reality head-mounted display that started as a Kickstarter project.
While a consumer version will be released in late 2014 or early 2015, a developer version

is already available. The developer kit comes with a seven inch display with a 1280x800
resolution running at 60 Hz. The screen is shared between both eyes, which means each eye
has its own set of 640x400 pixels. The consumer version will support Full HD resolution.
The development kit version is shown in Figure 4.16.
The Oculus Rift gets plugged into either an HDMI or a DVI port. USB connectivity is
additionally required for sending tracking data to the host machine. A three-axis gyroscope,
a three-axis magnetometer and a three-axis accelerometer are used to sense and correct
tracking data.
We use the Oculus Rift in combination with the Unity engine for being able to create rich
experience feedback visualizations.

4.6.2 Unity Integration
To close the gap between the analyzing and the visualization tier, we built a Unity prefab
that handles network communication and provides feedback scores and other relevant data
to Unity. A Unity prefab is a reusable game asset that can be inserted into the scene. When
inserting a prefab, an instance of the prefab is created and linked to the original prefab. When
we change the prefab, all instances that got inserted into the scene adjust accordingly.
Our custom prefab handles communication with the analyzing tier and creates a thread at
instance construction time. The thread gets removed along with the instance in the end. We
run a loop inside the thread that checks, if a network message is pending in the message
queue. Each time a message reaches the visualization tier at a given port, a data processing
callback is called.
UDP is used for network communication. Incoming and outgoing UDP messages contain a
UTF-8 identification string header for separating managing-messages from feedback scores.
The visualization tier mostly is a receiving network unit. The only message it responds to is a
broadcast message from the analyzing tier whose purpose is client search. The visualization

67

4 The Biofeedback Project

(right).
tier tells the analyzing tier its IP address, so that the analyzing tier knows where to send the
real-time data packages.
Our data messages contain a data block of 16 floats. Each of the floats is individually
extracted from four byes at a specified position in the array. Before the extracted data is put
into the feedback score array, it is converted to single-precision floating point numbers.
Classifiers in the analyzing tier mostly won’t make use of all the 16 feedback scores. Unused scores are marked with a value of −1.0. All other feedback scores are clamped and
normalized values so that they are in range between 0.0 and 1.0. Feedback score debugging
information is shown as text in the Unity visualizations.
Additionally, the total time of the session, the remaining time and the number of game points
are transmitted.
All transmitted data is stored in public shared objects. Visualizations use these shared objects
and adjust the scene accordingly.

4.6.3 Controlling Training Sessions
Using our session control plugin in the analyzing tier (see 4.17), we can start and stop
training sessions. The length of a session in seconds can be set before starting it.
A computer might have multiple network adapters with different IP addresses assigned to
them. In order to make our software work with all kinds of network setups, we implemented
a combo box where we can select the correct one.
While a training session is active, the time remaining and the achieved game points are
shown. After a training got completed, a window with statistics is shown. The achieved
number of game points and charts for feedback scores, as well as for all other sensory
information, are piled up in the window.

68

4.6 Visualization

Figure 4.18: Particle-based visualization for classifiers that output a single feedback score.

4.6.4 Particle-Based Visualization
The first of the visualizations is shown in Figure 4.18 and is a particle-based visualization.
The scene is made of two rotating discs which are textures with a transparent layer. The
transparent textures are spawned with the start of the application and are alive throughout
the session.
Next to the rotating discs, two particle systems are present in the scene. They both have
cylinder based emitters which spawn between 0 and 2000 particles, depending on the
incoming feedback score values. The maximum number of simultaneously present particles
is 10000.

4.6.5 Raindrop Barrel Visualization
The raindrop barrel visualization is shown in Figure 4.19 and is controlled by two feedback
scores. It consists of static environment meshes, particle systems, a reticle and a skybox. A
particle system that visualizes fire is located at the ground of the barrel. A bit further up we
have a particle system emitting smoke particles and one that creates a sprinkler.

69

4 The Biofeedback Project

Figure 4.19: Raindrop barrel scene where the goal is to extinguish the fire by a waterfall.
A reticle on the ground indicates where the sprinkler water hits. The first incoming feedback
score value controls the position of the reticle. The higher the feedback score, the more the
reticle moves towards the barrel. A second feedback score value indicates how much water
the sprinkler particle system emits.
If both feedback score values are high enough, the sprinkler is located directly on top of the
barrel and the water particles extinguish the fire. This is done by particle collision events
using C# scripts. If a water particle collides with a smoke or fire particle, the lifetime of the
smoke or fire particle gets decreased. This results in a faster annihilation and in extinguishing
the fire.

4.6.6 Car Racing Game
The car race scene (see Figure 4.20) is a demo project from Unity that has been customized to
fit our needs. The car behavior scripts have been rewritten in a way that we can control gear
changes, acceleration, damping values and the maximum speed with the incoming feedback
score.

70

4.6 Visualization

Figure 4.20: Car racing game where acceleration of the car can be controlled by a feedback
score.
Biofeedback applications should provide fast feedback. If the car tails in motion for many
seconds, we do not get a direct response and are not able to understand a given feedback
value. This is why we modified the damping and acceleration behavior.
A single feedback score value is used to control the car’s acceleration and speed. Steering is
done by either a gamepad or the keyboard. In order to get a user back on track in case of a
crash, the feedback-based forward acceleration can be overwritten to drive backwards.

4.6.7 Virtual Reality Scene
The palace fire scene is shown in Figure 4.21 and is a virtual reality scene we created
for testing biofeedback with the Oculus Rift. We use a fully textured and light-mapped
environment 3D model to create a little world that can be explored. A gamepad or keyboard
can be used to move, while the Oculus Rift is used to look around.
Two cameras are attached to the player’s game object for stereoscopic rendering. Each of the
cameras renders to one half of our final render target. A perspective correction post-pass
shader disturbs the rendered images to fit the lenses of the Oculus Rift and the inter-pupillary
distance of the user’s eyes.

71

user can start a fire based on a feedback score.
As biofeedback component, a fire particle system is placed at the center of the scene. The
user is able to wander and look around the scene while trying to make the fire glow. The
emitter of the fire particle system is bound to a feedback score value.
In the next chapter, we will walk over the evaluation that we did in order to test the
visualizations as well as the analyzing part of our biofeedback software.

72

5 Evaluation
In this chapter, the analyzing tier and the visualizations will be evaluated. We will talk about
different kinds of tests and classifiers that we designed for and used in the evaluation. We
will talk about recorded data and how our visualizations effected the participants. We will
also share and discuss reactions, findings, thoughts and suggestions.

5.1 Participants and Methodology
We had 8 participants taking part in our evaluation (4 male, 4 female, average age 26.5)
ranging from engineers to artists, a speech therapist, a business man and a public officer. All
participants did not have any biofeedback experience yet, nor they have used virtual reality
glasses. All participants volunteered to take part in the study. Each of the subjects signed a
rules and regulations document for security. The evaluation approximately took 3 hours per
subject.
Two workstations were used to run the analyzing and the visualization tiers. Both were
connected to a network, so that they were able to communicate with each other. Our
participants were sitting on a chair in front of a 47 inch screen, where our visualizations
were shown. The workstation running the analyzing tier was located at the opposite corner
of the room behind the participant, so that he didn’t get distracted. The feedback controller
started and stopped the evaluation tests from the analyzing unit.

(left) and a participant doing our mind-controlled racing game test (right).

73

5 Evaluation

Before starting a test, we explained the procedure to the participant and introduced him to
the upcoming visualization and controls. Also, we placed the physiological sensors onto
the participant, explained what these recorded and what they were for. In case a test was
using a virtual reality environment, the Oculus Rift as well as a game controller was used
by the participant. In this case, we first had to determine the inter-pupillary distance of the
user’s eyes in order to have a clear view through the Oculus Rift. After each test, we showed,
explained and discussed the resulting statistical graphs with the participant and interviewed
him.
A total of 7 tests have been completed per participant. Table 5.1 shows a summarized list of
them.
Test 1 A is a mind-controlled car racing game using the visualization described in Section
4.6.6. The car can be accelerated by staying focused and concentrated. As soon as
concentration gets lost, the car quickly breaks and comes to rest. In case the car hits
a wall or can’t make a track’s turn, a gamepad can be used to drive backwards and
overwrite the mind-controlled forward acceleration. The participant has to try to drive
as fast as possible.
Test 1 B is a control and comparison test using the visualization described in Section 4.6.4.
Instead of making a car drive, the user has to try to fill the scene with as much particles
as possible, by concentrating and focusing on the visualization. This test is done in
order to compare results between a simple visualization and a full game.
Test 2 A is a self-try meditation biofeedback test using our particle-based visualization. The
user has to try to calm down, relieve pressure and relax. No help is given in this test
other than the feedback visualization. The goal of this test is to see if users find own
ways to control the visualized feedback score.
Test 2 B is a guided-meditation biofeedback test using the particle-based visualization.
Several breathing techniques and meditation methods are explained to the user while
receiving visual feedback. This test is done in order to compare results from the
self-test and to see if a guided meditation helps with relaxation.
Test 3 A is a virtual reality biofeedback test using the visualization from Section 4.6.7. The
user wears both, the Oculus Rift as well as a NeuroSky headset at the same time. The
goal of this test is to keep a fire in the middle of the scene alive, while being able to
wander and look around. The more the user relaxes, the more active the fire becomes.
Test 3 B is a control and comparison test using the same visualization as in test 3 A. The
difference here is that the user does not wear a VR-headset, but instead he looks at a
screen. The user is also not able to look or walk around and sees the scene through a
fixed camera. This test is made to check if wearing VR-glasses influences meditation
capabilities.
Test 4 is the only test in the study using a classifier with multiple feedback scores. The
visualization shows a waterfall that can be moved towards a barrel on fire. The intensity
of the waterfall increases, by allowing the mind to relax while staying concentrated.

The other score value is linked to the heart rate. The closer heart rate moves to resting
heart rate, the closer the waterfall moves towards the barrel. The user tries to move the
waterfall towards the barrel and extinguish the fire with as much water as possible. The
goal of this test is to find out if users are able to control two separate body activities
separately.

5.2 Used Classifiers
Classifier A and B
Classifier A and B are very simple classifiers. Classifier A has a single feedback score node
which is mapped to the NeuroSky e-Sense attention value. Classifier B maps the e-Sense
meditation value to the feedback score node. Graphs of both classifiers can be seen in Figure
5.2.

75

5 Evaluation

Figure 5.3: Graph for classifier C.

Classifier C
Classifier C is the most complex one that we used for our evaluation. It involves two different
physiological sensors: NeuroSky’s MindWave Mobile and Zephyr’s BioHarness 3. The
classifier combines multiple values from the sensors to a single feedback score. It translates
data from the given sensors into a value representing how close the user is to the flow-state.
Flow-state means optimal concentration while the body and mind are relaxed. We sense
body relaxation by comparing the current heart rate against an individual resting heart
rate, calculate the difference between these and remap the difference to a normalized value.
Concentration, mind relaxation and body relaxation scores are summed up and then equally
averaged. Figure 5.3 shows the equation visually represented in our graph-based classifier.

Classifier D
Figure 5.4 shows the graph of classifier D. The difference between classifier C and D is
that classifier D outputs two feedback score values. In classifier D, we separate the mind’s
flow-state from body relaxation. The mind’s flow state is modeled by the summing up and
averaging the e-Sense attention and meditation values. Body relaxation is calculated by the
normalized difference between the current and the resting heart rate. Due to the separation,
we can feed the feedback scores to the visualization individually.

76

5.3 Results

Figure 5.4: Graph for classifier D.

5.3 Results
The evaluation showed that users either need a task while training or a verbal interaction
with the feedback controller. Tests 1 A and 2 B both met these requirements and had the most
successful results. In the racing game test (1 A), users were told to focus and concentrate
while they had to keep a car on track. In the guided meditation test (2 B), an interaction
with the feedback controller was taking place. Without an interaction or a task, participants
got bored after several minutes. In Figure 5.6, we can see that most participants showed
significant higher results in the car racing game test (1 A) than in the control and comparison
test (1 B).
In order to get in control of a body activity, participants tried to remember given feelings
and restore them again in case visualization indicated success. Participants with an interest
in Yoga or other meditation techniques, showed significant higher results and better control
of their bodies. Some of the users were able to control given tests, while others had a hard
time.
In Figure 5.5, we can see a stable increase of the feedback score value after minute 3. The
chart shows a feedback score over time that is linked to the NeuroSky e-Sense attention
value, from a participant that did the racing game test. The participant reported that he
started to imagine an ideal racing line, visualized it in his imagination and heavily focused
on his imagined line. He said that by doing that, he had the same feeling as when writing
an exam.
Other participants reported that they successfully increased the feedback score by telling
the car to drive faster in their imagination, by focusing on a given point in the visualized
scene or by imagining to drive a real car. A decrease of the feedback score happened when

users looked away from the visualization, or when the visualization became more boring
e.g. when the car went into a dark tunnel or when it exited a city and entered a wide open
landscape. A participant reported that just driving the car is not an as intense feeling as
when really focusing.
Participants reported that our particle-based visualization did not clearly represent the
feedback score. They were able to differentiate between states like no particles, some
particles and maximum emission rate, but had a hard time to really get a sense of the current
value.
The majority of our participants enjoyed the guided meditation test and subjectively were
very relaxed and refreshed afterwards. In Figure 5.7, we can see that all participants
had a significant higher result in the guided meditation test (2 B) than in the control and
comparison test (2 A). One of the participants told us that his body became warm and two
participants were tired afterwards. Though the guided meditation test shows successful

5.3 Results

results, the visualization was distracting and maybe even useless. In the raw waveform
window, we were able to see slowly oscillating sinus wave like patterns in the middle of the
guided meditation session for some of the participants. These kind of waves were looking
significantly different than what we normally saw and had the shape of alpha brain waves.
The NeuroSky headset did not stably detect any alpha brain waves though.
Figure 5.8 shows that 5 out of 8 participants were less relaxed in the virtual reality test (3
A) when wearing the Oculus Rift than in the control and comparison test (3 B). It was so
exciting to wear the VR glasses for most participants that they had a hard time to calm down
and relax. They also reported that the fire went active when wandering around the scene.
We assume this is because the NeuroSky headset is not able to extract a valid signal while
moving the head. In contrast to the majority, one user reported that he was able to relax
more in the dark environment when wearing the Oculus Rift than without it in the bright
room.
The virtual environment test scene introduced in Section 4.6.7 is the only one using a
threshold for the feedback score visualization. A threshold is used to ignore all feedback
scores lower than the given value. This means that there is no fire shown for feedback scores
in range between 0.0 and the specified threshold value. Users reported that the visualization
with the threshold was a lot clearer and made it easier to interpret the feedback score.
Figure 5.9 shows the point and feedback score charts from a participant that did the car
racing test. We can see a clear decrease in the feedback score after 6 minutes. The user
reported that in the beginning he tried a lot, thinking about many different things in order
to find out what works and what doesn’t. In the end, he was not able to focus anymore at
the level he started with.
In Figure 5.10, we can see the heart rate quickly increased soon before the end of the test,
while the participant did not start to move. This was exactly the moment when the feedback
controller told the participant to be wide awake again.

heart rate, seen in the left chart, and the resting heart rate of the participant. The participant
was able to keep his heart rate close to the resting heart rate throughout the test. The
participant reported that the test was too easy for him and that it became boring.

5.3.1 Comfort
Overall, users were comfortable with the tests and the environment. They told us that it
was a weird feeling wearing sensors and being recorded and tracked in the beginning. The
feeling was gone after a short period of time though.

The NeuroSky MindWave Mobile itched after several minutes and left clearly visible red
marks on skin when wearing it for a longer time. The BioHarness 3 sensor has been approved
by all participants as very comfortable.
Half of the visualizations had no audio output, so the tests were done in a silent environment.
Several users were slightly uncomfortable with the silent environment while having sensors
attached to them.

81

5 Evaluation

5.3.2 Ease of Use
With the separation of the analyzing and the visualization tier, network communication and
the classification graph, our system is not comparable to a simple mobile application for
everyday use. Even though we followed usability patterns and took care about simplifying
processes, controlling the system won’t be possible without a learning phase.
Putting the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile on and off is quite simple compared to many other
sensors that require heavy setup and care. Electrodes of the Emotiv EPOC for example need
to be wet with a saline solution in order to function correctly. After several minutes these
sensors become dry again, require maintenance and wet the users’ heads.
In combination with an Oculus Rift, setting up the NeuroSky sensor is a bit more complicated
though. With the VR-headset on, there is only little space left between the headset and the
user’s hair. As seen in Figure 5.1, we placed the BCI on top of the Oculus Rift for the VR-tests.
The »Oculus Config Utility« was a huge time safer and helped a lot with determining the
inter-pupillary distance of the user’s eyes.

5.3.3 Degree of Frustration
Most frustrating was losing the BCI’s signal. Especially with one of the subjects, we had
a hard time keeping the signal up. The NeuroSky headset needs to be pressured against
the forehead while the sensor does not have anything on the back side of the head that
compensates the force. Sometimes, the result after some minutes is a worse signal. The
position of the headset needs to be adjusted and corrected in this case, in the middle of a
session.
Two of the participants had a hard time with test 4. The problem was that their heart rate
came nowhere near the goal, even after breathing exercises and meditation help. We should
have adjusted the classifiers here to push motivation and decrease frustration. We were not
able to do that though, as the tests for the evaluation needed to be equally fair.

5.3.4 Adaptability to Different Users
Both, NeuroSky’s headset as well as the BioHarness 3 sensor were working with all users. The
NeuroSky headset adapted well to all head sizes. The BioHarness sensor has an adjustable
chest strap, so that people with different weights can adjust it to fit their bodies. Though,
we had a problem with the chest strap with female users. The strap was not able to detect
any heart beat when wearing a bra. We had to switch over to a compression t-shirt, that was
available separately and was designed for these special cases, in order to get a valid signal.
Our software was designed to easily adapt to users with different experience and skill levels.
Though, we did not use these features for the evaluation to keep tests comparable.

82

5.4 Discussion

5.4 Discussion
We think that customization and interaction with the feedback controller are key to successful
biofeedback training. A comparable and fair test environment, like in our evaluation, obstruct
the learning process. Different users may have different baselines for one or the other
measured data. Several users were bored with some of our tests as they were too easy,
while others couldn’t even reach the goal for a single second. We can easily customize the
classifiers to fit user needs, make training more interesting and more challenging without
making it too difficult. The problem with specifying custom parameters to classifiers though
is, that results won’t be comparable anymore, which was essential for our evaluation.
During focus group meetings and the evaluation, we learned a lot about the DOs & DON’Ts
when designing visualizations. Visualizations are quickly seen as too complex, especially
when visualizing more than 2 feedback scores. A fast responding visualization is absolutely
essential for biofeedback. Compared to our first visualization prototype for test 4, we e.g.
increased speed of fire particles and also decreased their lifetime to respond faster. Generally
it is recommended to focus on a single optimized visualization as a starting point.
The Oculus Rift was disturbing for most of the participants in the first run. They reported
that they had a hard time to relax, due to many new impressions at the same time. Though,
we see a lot of potential for biofeedback applications with the Oculus Rift. After becoming
comfortable and gaining some experience in a long-term biofeedback training, we think the
Oculus Rift can have a positive impact.
The NeuroSky e-Sense values were heavily unstable in all cases. Due to the instability, participants had a hard time controlling the values. They said that feeling and even controlling
the heart rate was a lot easier. We hoped to get access to an Emotiv Insight before the project
deadline, but its release got delayed to summer 2014. For future tests, we will try a range of
other physiological sensors.
Test 3 A and B were the only ones with a feedback score threshold. Feedback scores below
0.4 were all floored to 0.0. A problem with the tests without a feedback score threshold was
that users had a hard time to see if their body activity tends towards the goal or if they were
completely wrong. On the other side though, a problem with the threshold in the evaluation
was that users did not see the feedback score visualization at all, in case it was below the
threshold. Interpretation was a lot easier when using a threshold, as users were easily able
to see if the feedback score was very low, as e.g. no fire burned at all in this case. Also,
NeuroSky’s e-Sense values are claimed to not be meaningful below our threshold of 0.4.
So using the threshold, we suspended all values that didn’t contain valid information. We
recommend and will use thresholds for future tests directly in the classifier.
Several participants reported that they were able to relax better with eyes closed. They doublechecked their meditation scores by quickly opening the eyes, checking the visualization and
comparing the result. It might be better to work with both, audio and visual feedback, and
use audio for initial or beginner sessions. Users also reported that engine and gear shift
sounds in the car racing game were important feedback score indicators.

83

5 Evaluation

An interesting fact that participants reported is that if they concentrated on becoming relaxed,
the exact opposite was measured which seemed irritating. And in case users got upset about
it, it worked even further against them. This is another example of why interaction with the
feedback controller is very important. According to [LWS07], relaxation only works if the
mind allows the body to relax. In case users try hard to relax, it will only works against
them.

5.5 Limitations and Problems
With this project, a flexible, reusable and working biofeedback framework has been created.
However, there are some limitations and problems that we faced during the evaluation. A
list of these are described in this section.
There are unlimited ways to support or influence users in biofeedback sessions. Many ways
need to be tried out in order to find effective ones. Knowledge from different areas ranging
from medical science, psychology, computer science to applied meditation and personal
improvement techniques are required to find best practices.
There are limits in the empirical results of our evaluation. Users did, and generally will not
see long-term body control improvements in a single session. Biofeedback requires multiple
training sessions over several weeks [Sea12]. We can compare biofeedback with learning to
play piano or football. We’re afraid a long-term evaluation was not possible, due to the time
frame of the project.
Doing the same tests for all users works in contrary to the biofeedback principles and
decreases the learning effect. Sensed body activity peaks are quickly disappearing events
that need to be addressed directly with help from the feedback controller. Classifiers also
need to be customized per user. When using the same classification parameters for all users,
some of them become bored as it feels too easy and others become frustrated because they
can’t succeed at all.
Designing and creating visualizations is a bottomless pit. Unlimited work can be put into
nice visuals. Teams of hundreds of artists and software engineers work for multiple years on
a video game for example. Compromises had to be made for our project due to manpower
and the time frame.
Classifiers with multiple feedback scores are too complicated to control for users without
biofeedback experience. For the first sessions, we recommend training single feedback
scores. If users are unable to control a single body activity, it is impossible to understand,
differentiate and control multiple.
There are many ways to combine values from physiological sensors. A limiting factor was
that we were only able to try out just a few in the evaluation.
Way too less participants, physiological sensors, visualizations and classifiers were tested
and way too less different kinds of tests were done for generally representative results.

84

5.5 Limitations and Problems

Doing several tests directly after each other affects the results. Users may be too tired for a
following test after concentrating in the previous one.
Some of the participants were uncomfortable with the silence while evaluation. In order to
solve the issue, we put some gentle music on.
Signal stability of NeuroSky’s headset was a serious issue. The signal interrupted several
times during the evaluation.
Sometimes it is hard to comprehend values from the NeuroSky headset as they are alternating
a lot. Rather than using the value for interpretation directly, we recommend to introduce
ranges.
Muscle tension heavily influences vales from the NeuroSky headset. Even relaxing neck
muscles, that are located at the opposite side of the head, effect the e-Sense values.
Participants were irritated by the low resolution of the Oculus Rift developer kit.
Several participants were disturbed by the sound effects when water hit the barrel in test
4. For the future, we will use audio that matches well to the goal of the classifier and the
atmosphere of the session.

85

6 Conclusion and Future Work
This chapter summarizes the thesis, discusses its findings and contributions, points out
limitations and also outlines directions for future research. The biofeedback framework
including acquisition of data from physiological sensors, analysis with our graph-based
classification system and the visualizations that we created in this thesis have proven to be
working. However, still many extensions of this research deserve further consideration.

Conclusion
This project was mainly intended to create a flexible framework for physiological sensors
and biofeedback visualizations that can be used for further research projects.
After providing an introduction about bio- and neurofeedback, physiological sensor modalities and recording techniques were presented in Chapter 2. A comprehensive analysis of
related work was presented in Chapter 3. We walked over medical case studies, physiological monitoring scenarios, how physiological sensors and biofeedback are used for peak
performance training, for health care and in the game industry.
In Chapter 4, the goals of the thesis and the approach used in order to achieve them were
explained. The system overview with the extension of the traditional biofeedback loop and
the split up into an analyzing and a visualization tier were introduced, together with the
software architecture and the network communication guidelines. How to acquire data from
physiological sensors, how to store it and how to access it in an efficient way was discussed.
Data management played an important role as multiple sensors streamed data with high
sampling rates simultaneously, while resources were still needed for data visualization.
After data acquisition, the dataset was fed into our visual and dynamic graph-based classification system. We were able to create and edit graph-based classifiers for basically any
given formula visually via a convenient graphical user interface. Classifiers were used to
translate data from multiple sensors into new, user-defined feedback scores that were sent to
the visualizations. Though visual programming is common these days, our classification
system is considered as valuable contribution since no comparable system existed.
Multiple feedback visualizations that have been created for the project, including a virtual
reality scene where we used an Oculus Rift in order to check the influence of virtual reality
in biofeedback, were introduced and explained.
Finally, an evaluation with 8 participants (each doing 7 tests) was done with the aim to
find best practices for classification, visualization and biofeedback interaction in Chapter 5.

87

6 Conclusion and Future Work

Comfort, ease of use, degree of frustration as well as the adaptability to different users was
researched along with the operational capability of physiological sensors and the effect of
virtual reality. The tests included a mind-controlled car racing game, a guided meditation
and a virtual reality biofeedback test. Next to the mentioned tests, several control and
comparison tests have been done. Reactions that we got from users were outstanding and
incredibly positive. Even though the desired effect wasn’t always there, people loved to use
our system, were fascinated about the technology and interested in exploring their body
activities.
The biofeedback framework including acquisition of data from various physiological sensors,
analysis with our graph-based classification system and the visualization engine interfaces
that we created in this thesis are working and will be a great foundation for further projects.
With its carefully designed software architecture, it is easy to add all kinds of new physiological sensors to the framework, as helper modules are kept separately and visual node
representations used in the classifiers, are automatically created. The separation of the
analyzing from the visualization tier allows the system to run heavy calculations and visualizations, as more processing power is available while information is shared across the
network.
The thesis showed that key for successful biofeedback are interaction with the feedback
controller, interaction with the visualization and customization of classifiers and sessions.
Visualizations need to be fast responding and simple. Our experiments showed that visualizing more than two feedback scores simultaneously is considered as too complex. Also,
users want to be able to interpret the exact value of the feedback score, which e.g. was not
fully possible with our particle-based visualization. We recommend to embed thresholds
into classifiers in order to help users with interpretation by clamping values that indicate
failure. The evaluation showed that users were grateful about the threshold in test 3A and
3B, as it made feedback score interpretation easier.
Values from the NeuroSky brain-computer interface were heavily unstable throughout the
evaluation and with some participants we had a hard time even keeping the signal up.
Research showed that the NeuroSky headset is able to determine if users are concentrated
or relaxed. Though, we think that the e-Sense outputs are more Boolean than precise
percentaged values. The Oculus Rift in our virtual reality biofeedback test disturbed most
of the participants, as they got too many impressions at the same time. After becoming
comfortable and gaining some experience in a long-term biofeedback training, we think the
Oculus Rift can have a positive impact.
There are limits in the empirical results of our evaluation. What we learned in this project is
that a comparable and fair test environment does not work for biofeedback. Biofeedback
sessions need to be personally challenging and customized. There are unlimited ways to
support or influence users in biofeedback sessions. Knowledge from different areas ranging
from medical science, psychology, computer science to applied meditation and personal
improvement techniques are required to find best practices. Moreover, there are many ways
to combine values from physiological sensors. A limiting factor was that we were only
able to try out a few sensors in the evaluation. Furthermore, way too less participants,
physiological sensors, visualizations and classifiers were tested and way too less different

88

kinds of tests were done for generally representative results. Additionally, designing and
creating good-looking and meaningful visualizations is a bottomless pit.
In this project, we created a powerful biofeedback toolset which is a flexible and extendable platform for future physiological sensors. The visual and interactive graph-based
classification system enables feedback controllers to easily change the classification process and customize it for their users while the two tier architecture allows state-of-the-art
visualizations with any rendering engine.
We will definitely keep on working on this superbly interesting project and already have
future plans for it.

Future Work
Based on the work that has been done, findings from focus groups and the evaluation, many
opportunities and possibilities came up and we hope to be able to implement all of the
following ideas in the upcoming months.
First of all, other physiological sensors can be added to the system. Specifically we are
waiting on the Emotiv Insight and MELON1 , which are both going to be released in summer
this year.
Based on findings from this project, new visualizations can be created in order to support
effectiveness of the system. Research has shown that simple and fast responding visualizations work best. A maximum of two feedback scores is not recognized as too complex.
Additionally, visualizations shall be designed in a way where feedback scores are embedded
spatially, so that users are able to detect the percentaged score without knowing the actual
value. Next to a graphical representation, a slider bar that shows the feedback score would
be helpful for users that are more numbers-driven. Another huge helper for understanding
body activity can be a history chart of the feedback score. This can especially be useful for
understanding the bigger picture of what has happened in the last seconds next to direct
feedback.
Other classifiers can be used to enhance understanding and control of body activities.
Customization plays a key role here. Different users have different baseline values and start
at different skill levels. Classifiers with a range of parameters that can be set prior a session,
can make training more effective and also more fun for the user. A library of customizable
classifiers for different use cases can be built.
With a range of standard classifiers, we can also create a mobile application. Users can
select a given training type and enter their data for customization. The mobile application
then selects the classifier automatically in the background and links the entered data to
it. Additionally, an online platform can be created where users are able to see charts and
statistics of their training sessions.

6 Conclusion and Future Work

A good biofeedback session concept is based on a symbiosis of medical and psychological
knowledge and experience in combination with a technological base. The tricks on how
to trigger given body activities can be either researched or collected. We would love
to collaborate with mental trainers, neurologists, psychologists, yoga trainers and sport
enthusiasts in the future in order to design interactive training sessions and do long-term
studies to proof effectiveness and compare results with other biofeedback systems.
In case higher-level output values and performance metrics from physiological sensors are
not sufficient anymore, own signal processing can be implemented. Signal processing can be
even graphically implemented by extending our graph to a hierarchical one. A sensor node
can contain a child graph where signal processing is handled and visually edited. Filters,
window functions or full frequency analysis can be represented by nodes where spectrums
or keytracks are passed along connections.
