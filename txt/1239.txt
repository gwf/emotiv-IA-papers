Abstract. Brain computer interface (BCI) is a device that allows us to scan brainwaves. Achieved signals
can be processed using a computer and the analyzed brain activity can be than monitored. In this paper, the
use of the non-invasive brain scanning method applied on person at solving a system of equations is
described. This solving the system of equations was obtained by two mathematical methods. The
measurement was performed for solving equations by Gaussian elimination and by substitution methods
separately. The results of the measurements were visualized by graphing the brain activity. The aim of the
work
is
to
determine
the
more
practical
method
of
those
two.

1 Introduction
The EEG curve (Electroencephalogram) is an entry of
the change in time of electric capability (EEG signal)
known as brain activity. The signal is different for
everybody and it varies with age, gender, alertness and
other factors. The character of the signal is mostly
similar for same kind of human activities. That makes
the signal worthy to evaluate. More information about
the EEG curve can be found here. [1]-[7]
There are three main methods to capture the signal.
It can be captured by an invasive, partially invasive and
non-invasive method. Invasive method requires
neurosurgical procedure involving opening the scull and
implanting the electrodes right to the grey cerebral
cortex. The method guarantees the highest quality of
signal received. However, there is a risk of permanent
brain damage connected with the invasive method.
Partially invasive method requires electrodes to be
connected inside of the skull, but also outside the brain.
The signal has higher quality than the signal captured by
non-invasive method and the risk of cerebral tissue’s
damage is lower. Non-invasive method is the least risky
of those three. The signal is captured from the surface of
the head. These methods are described here [2]. [1]-[7]
For this work, we have used the device BCI Emotive
EPOC+ that captures brain signal using the non-invasive
method by measuring brain waves from the skull
surface.
In our case, the signal is measured and processed
directly by an app called EmoBrainMap. This
application allows to process and display the vary of the
brain signal: alpha, beta, delta and theta waves.
This article deals with measuring the brain wave
signal during the process of solving the system of
equations by two methods (Gaussian elimination and
*

substitution method) using the version of the app
EmoBrainMap. [1]-[7]
The first part of the article defines the system of
equations and methods used to solve it (Gaussian
elimination method and substitution method).
The chapter explaining the basic brain hemisphere
activity follows. Brain waves, such as alpha, delta, theta
and especially beta waves (important for mathematical,
logical and analytical thinking) are described further.
After that, we move on to the experimental part with
all the results. The last part of this article is the
conclusion chapter, where we determine which method
is more practical on the base of results from brain signal
measurement.

2 System of linear equations
Let’s have a system (1) according to rules in [8]:
𝑎𝑎11 𝑥𝑥1 + 𝑎𝑎12 𝑥𝑥2 + ⋯ + 𝑎𝑎1𝑛𝑛 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛 = 𝑏𝑏1
𝑎𝑎21 𝑥𝑥1 + 𝑎𝑎22 𝑥𝑥2 + ⋯ + 𝑎𝑎2𝑛𝑛 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛 = 𝑏𝑏2
⋮
𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚1 𝑥𝑥1 + 𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚2 𝑥𝑥2 + ⋯ + 𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛 = 𝑏𝑏𝑛𝑛

(1)

where 𝑎𝑎11 … 𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ∈ ℝ and 𝑏𝑏1 … 𝑏𝑏𝑛𝑛 ∈ ℝ. Then we call
the upper schema the system of linear equations.
Particular application of this system can be seen e.g. in
[9].
2.1 Gaussian elimination method
The Gaussian elimination method consists of
transforming the original system of linear equations to

the new simplified system of the linear equations. These
two systems are equivalent. Row reduction makes use of
elementary row operations ( we are working with
numbers instead of variables). This method is further
described here. [6]

• Delta waves (1 – 4 Hz) show up in a state of deep
meditation, deep sleep or unconsciousness. Their
presence implies that the body is in a process of deep
regeneration.
• Theta waves (4 – 8 Hz) are active during deep
relaxation, meditation and sleep. The long-term
memory is being stimulated and nonobvious
solutions come up in this state. [7]

2.2 Substitution method
The substitution method works with both coefficients
and variables. With the help of the operation called
substitution we convert the system of n equations to the
system of 𝑛𝑛 − 1 equations and process is repeated until
we find a root. Then with the use of substitution the rest
of the roots are calculated. [6]

4 Brain Computer Interface
The connection of BCI device to the brain and
computer serves as a signal transfer line. Brain signals
are captured by the device and sent to the computer to
for analysis. The computer receives the EEG signals and
process it via software tool, then displays the analysed
signal in a visualised form to the researcher.
The picture bellow shows the use of the device. First
the electrodes are lubricated and then scanning helmet is
put on head. The signal captured by electrodes is
amplified, transformed to the digital form and sent to the
computer wirelessly.
The measurement process itself does not require any
special collaboration from a subject, except from
executing the given task. [2,5]

3 Central Nervous System
The nervous system consists of central nervous system
(CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). The parts
of the CNS are brain and spinal cord. Nerves and ganglia
outside the brain together with the spinal cord form PNS.
Vital body functions (heartbeat, breathing), muscle
movement and cognitive functions as thinking, speech,
memory retention and emotion processing are managed
by the brain itself.
It is commonly divided to two hemispheres: left and
right hemisphere. Each of those serves to a different
purpose but they are actively collaborating. People
usually have one hemisphere dominant and other one
complementary.
The right hemisphere helps with factual and logical
thinking, language, exact science, math, pragmatic and
analytical thinking, organizing. The left hemisphere
relates to emotions, imagination, art perception, sport
and synthetic thinking. [7]
3.1 Brainwaves
Electromagnetic field around the brain is composed by
brainwaves. It is created by electrical activity of neurons.
The most frequently mentioned are: Alpha, Beta,
Gamma, Delta and Theta waves. These are all active in
certain moments in human life. Their frequency is
measured in Hertz (Hz). [7]

4.1 Emotiv EPOC+
Emotiv EPOC+ device is intended for scalable and
contextual human brain research. The kit comes with a
set of helmet and proprietary USB receiver. We can
observe the brain activity during emotional expressions
and thinking processes on a colourful real-time
animation. [4]
The 16 scalp sensors are bit tough to attach correctly
but work seamlessly. The software will indicate the
correct attachment of each sensor by picturing the sensor
green on output visualisation. [4]

• Gamma waves (40 – 100 Hz) play important role in
thinking and memory. They are emitted when the
brain is exposed to difficult tasks.
• Beta waves (12 – 40 Hz) dominate the field in
conscious state. Higher frequencies signal irritation,
anger, nervousness or fear. Lower frequencies
indicate tiredness or sleepiness. Their activity is
higher when the brain applies logical and analytical
thinking to solve a task or problem. This part of
brainwave spectrum is the key examination factor for
this work.
• Alpha waves (8 – 12 Hz) are dominant in the state of
release and rest, when we are not bombarded by
information or actions requiring our immediate
attention.

hemisphere (the one which is responsible for logical and
mathematical thinking) is noticeable.
The conclusion is that the Gaussian elimination
method for solving linear equations is easier for a human
brain to process than the other method.

5 Experimental Part
5.1 Aims of the experiment
The main goal of the experiment was to compare two
mathematical methods for solving Systems of linear
equations (Gaussian elimination and substitution
method) and determine which one is easier to use.
The authors assume, that the easier solution comes
with the use of Gaussian elimination method, because it
operates mostly with numbers. The solving process is
harder on the contrary with substitution method because
the solver must think which variables should be
substituted with expression and manipulate with
fractions, which is usually more complicated operation.

5.2 Description of the experiment
There were total of five people participating in this
experiment. Each subject was given the same task and
same set of instructions.
The instruction was to solve the system of linear
equations first by Gaussian elimination and then by
substitution method. The given linear system (2):
4𝑥𝑥1 + 3𝑥𝑥2 − 9𝑥𝑥3 = 9
2𝑥𝑥1 + 5𝑥𝑥2 − 8𝑥𝑥3 = 8
𝑥𝑥1 + 8𝑥𝑥2 − 7𝑥𝑥3 = 12

(2)

had just one correct solution: 𝐾𝐾 = {[3,2,1]}.

5.3 Results of experiment
All subjects showed higher brain activity when solving
the system by substitution, in contrast with Gaussian
elimination where activity was lower. Notice the brain
activity during solving the system of equation by
Gaussian elimination on the picture (Figure 3). Mostly
right brain hemisphere was dominant (not responsible
for mathematics and logic but for simple operations).
The next picture (Figure 4) shows a subject’s brain
activity visualization when solving the system by
substitution method. The higher brain activity in left

6 Conclusion
The advantage of BIC is its multipurpose usage for
scientific and recreational purposes (for example to play
games using thinking) as well. The scientific usage
includes: brain activity analysis (evaluating the
complexity level of certain activities), disease detection,
mind-controlling the devices, improving concentration
(training the brain to manage thoughts efficiently).
Our work was focused on finding out which
mathematical method for solving systems of linear

equations from two handpicked methods is easier to use.
The practical use of the knowledge is, that we can use it
identify harder tasks and replace them with easier
equivalents.
Our university collaborates with University
Hospital Ostrava, which tries to implement BCI use to
improve the rehabilitation process. The tasks which seem
to be too complicated for patients (measured by scanning
EEG signals) are replaced by more pleasant tasks for a
patient. Thanks to the BCI systems the neuro-deficient
patient has the possibility to actively participate in
rehabilitation process with help of mind self-regulation
and concentration improving techniques.
The university plans to buy full paid version of the
software, when research results show greater success in
the future. The paid version includes processing the EEG
signal using statistics or neural networks.
The outcome we get from the research will be
useful for developing software that will help doctors
diagnose brain related diseases and anomalies more
effectively and accurately.
