Past, Present and Future

arXiv:1704.04697v2 [cs.RO] 18 May 2017

Jesse Leaman, and Hung M. La, Senior Member, IEEE
Abstract—A smart wheelchair (SW) is a power wheelchair
(PW) to which computers, sensors, and assistive technology are
attached. In the past decade, there has been little effort to provide
a systematic review of SW research. This paper aims to provide
a complete state-of-the-art overview of SW research trends. We
expect that the information gathered in this study will enhance
awareness of the status of contemporary PW as well as SW
technology, and increase the functional mobility of people who
use PWs. We systematically present the international SW research
effort, starting with an introduction to power wheelchairs and the
communities they serve. Then we discuss in detail the SW and
associated technological innovations with an emphasis on the most
researched areas, generating the most interest for future research
and development. We conclude with our vision for the future
of SW research and how to best serve people with all types of
disabilities.

I. I NTRODUCTION AND R EVIEW M ETHODOLOGY

P

EOPLE with cognitive/motor/sensory impairment,
whether it is due to disability or disease, rely on power
wheelchairs (PW) for their mobility needs. Since some
people with disabilities cannot use a traditional joystick to
navigate their PW they use alternative control systems like
head joysticks, chin joysticks, sip-n-puff, and thought control
[1]–[5]. In many cases PW users have difficulties with daily
maneuvering tasks and would benefit from an automated
navigation system. Mobility aside, people with disabilities are
heavily reliant on their caregivers for eating and drinking,
handling items, and communicating with others, especially in
large groups.
To accommodate the population of individuals who find it
difficult or impossible to operate a PW, several researchers
have used technologies originally developed for mobile robots
to create smart wheelchairs [4], [6]–[9]. A smart wheelchair
(SW) typically consists of either a standard PW base to which
a computer and a collection of sensors have been added, or
a mobile robot base to which a seat has been attached [10].
Pineau et al. 2011 argue that the transition to wheelchairs that
cooperate with the user is at least as important as that from
manual to powered wheelchairs, possibly even more important
since this would mark a paradigmatic rather than merely a
technological shift [11].
Overall, there has been a huge effort in research and development (R&D) on both PWs and SWs in particularly, and
assistive technology in general for people with disabilities.
There have been many reported R&D successes, like innovative

autonomous SWs [12]–[14]. However, in the past decade since
the work by Simpson [15] and Ding et al. in 2005 [16], there
has been little effort to extensively and intensively review, and
more importantly provide a complete state-of-the-art overview
of the research trends for SWs. To fill this gap, in this paper
we aim to provide the readers and researchers a systematic and
comprehensive review of the international SW research efforts
since the major review works by Simpson and Ding in 2005
[15], [16].
To that end we conducted a literature search in major
electronic databases including, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar
and PubMed. The articles were included in this systematic
review when they met the following criteria: (i) they were
written in English; (ii) they were published from 2005 to 2015;
and (iii) the conference proceedings were also examined only if
they were substantially different from journal articles presented
by the same authors. Titles and abstracts were first screened,
and then the full text copies of all studies were examined to
determine whether they met the pre-specified inclusion criteria.
The essential component of our search keyword should be
“wheelchair” then we add more supplemental words to form
our keywords. We started with powered wheelchair and electric
wheelchair keywords to acquire an overall result. Since the
search produced a significantly large number of results, we
refined the keywords by grouping or adding more specific keywords such as “powered wheelchair”, “electric wheelchair”,
“intelligent wheelchair”, “autonomous wheelchair”, “robotic
wheelchair”, and [“human factors” + “wheelchair”] to narrow down the search area and increase the chance of getting
relevant hits. We also create several combinations using those
keywords to enhance our search. Table I illustrates the search
results when using a set of keywords on different popular
databases. At the end, the search revealed 155 references that
described achievements in SW research, which we present in
the chronology shown in Table II.

give people with disabilities not only mobility but also the
necessary help and support to handle daily living activities. We
hope that the information gathered in this study will enhance
awareness of the status of contemporary SW technology, and
ultimately increase the functional mobility and productivity of
people who use PWs.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: next we
present past achievements in PW development (Sec. II), followed by a description of the international SW research effort
and an overview of the main topics of interest (Sec. III).
Then we showcase the particular research in the areas of input
methods (Sec. IV), operating modes (Sec. V), and human
factors (Sec. VI). Finally, we lay out our vision of the future of
SW research and development (Sec. VII), and conclude with
a discussion of changes since the last review (Sec. VIII).
II. PAST: T HE P OWER W HEELCHAIR
George Klein invented the first PW for people with
quadriplegia injured in world war II while he was working
as a mechanical engineer for the National Research Council of

Canada [22]. A person with that level of disability is by default
bedridden because without assistance from people and/or technology there would be no way to get up. That being said, with
the right combination of human and technological resources, a
person with quadriplegia can still have an extremely rich life
and make a major contribution to society, a philosophy we
hope to share with people who have just experienced the onset
of disability.
While primarily intended for people with mobility disabilities, those suffering from ailments resulting in fatigue, and pain
can also benefit from a PW. By 1956 Everest & Jennings and
the American Wheelchair Company began producing PWs for
mass sales [23]. The basic components of a PW are:
• Chassis, or drive system, may be front-wheel, rear-wheel,
center-wheel, or all-wheel-drive. Chassis may be foldable
[24], include stairclimbing ability (Fig. 1a), have standing
ability (Fig. 1b), have all-terrain tank tracks (Fig. 1c), or
4-wheel all-terrain drive (Fig. 1d, 1e).
• Batteries: The first PWs derived their power from 2- 24V
wet cell batteries. But these batteries have to be removed
from the wheelchair during travel on airplanes. They were
eventually replaced by dry cell batteries.
• Controller is the interface between human and machine.
Commercially available controllers include: hand joystick,
sip-n-puff, chin joystick, and head joystick.
• Seating system: Seats, are typically upgraded to include
cushions that use foam, gel, or air to prevent pressure
sores; Backrests, are typically padded with foam and
can be motorized to tilt and recline; Lateral supports
keep the user from tilting side-to-side; and Footrests, are
either removable or motorized to accommodate a more
comfortable reclining position.
Medicare prescription guidelines limit PWs to those individuals who cannot use a manual wheelchair. But many more
people would benefit from a PW, and often resort to less
expensive, generic solutions that often do not meet the needs
of the individual and their particular disability.
Some people with quadriplegia end up making major modifications to their own wheelchairs in order to have additional
safety measures, like lights or reflectors, rearview cameras, and
assistive technology to use as an input method for computing.
Co-author, Dr. Jesse Leaman, began his quest to improve
the PW user experience in 1998 while a summer intern at
NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center. By 2007, his invention,
the information technology upgrade package for PWs, dubbed
“Gryphon Shield”, was recognized as one of the the year’s

3

top 25 inventions by the History Channel and the National
Inventors Hall of Fame [25]. By 2010, however the system had
grown too large, and heavy for the wheelchair base, and had
become difficult to maintain. The upgrade of “Gryphon Shield”
is the iChair presented in [26], [27] where we take advantage
of a head tracking mouse [28] and a Mount-n-Mover [29].
Overall, past studies have successfully achieved initial technological advancements that aid PW users in their daily activities. Nevertheless, there is little assistive technology included in
the wheelchair to make it “smart,” which is the goal of research
on integrating “intelligent” technology on a PW, called “smart
wheelchair”.
III. P RESENT: T HE S MART W HEELCHAIR
This section presents current SW research achievements
around the world revealing a major shift from PW to SW.
Fig. 1 shows several recent power wheelchair options that
can be used as the platform for a SW. Some early SWs were
mobile robots with a seat attached [30], [31], but most were
based on heavily modified commercially available PWs to
which computers and sensors are attached [15]. The majority
of SWs that have been developed to date have been tightly
integrated with the underlying PW, requiring significant modifications to function properly [10], [32]. Ideally the SW system
should easily be removable from the underlying wheelchair
so that the user can attach it to a different chair, which is
especially important for children, who may go through several
wheelchairs before they are all grown-up [11].
It is challenging to build an efficient SW that people with
all types of disabilities feel comfortable using. The system
should be mountable on any make of PW, easily removable for
maintenance and travel. Table III lists institutions around the
world that have produced a SW prototype since 2005, which
illustrates that interest in the topic has grown in recent years.
Sensor/software packages, like collision avoidance, have had
widespread success in the automotive industry, becoming less
expensive and more trusted than ever before. Based on our
search results, we have divided present research into three main
topics: (i) input methods; (ii) operating modes; and (iii) human
factors.
IV. I NPUT METHODS
The best choice of input method(s) is not always obvious, but
it is usually user specific. Table IV lists subtopics and example
references in the field of SW input method research. Parikh et
al. 2007 [106] describe the foundations for creating a simple
methodology for extracting user profiles, which can be used
to adequately select the best command mode for each user.
The methodology is based on an interactive wizard with a set
of simple tasks for the user, and a method for extracting and
analyzing the user’s execution of those tasks. Figure 2 shows
several popular input methods including touch (a), computer
vision (b), accelerometer (c), and EEG (d).
Faria et al. 2014 [107] argue that despite many distinct
SW projects around the world, the adaptation of their user
interface to the patient is an often neglected research topic.
They recommend developing new concepts using multimodal

interfaces and wheelchair interfaces adapted to the user’s
characteristics.
The thought-controlled intelligent machine (TIM [108]) successfully implemented both head-movement controller (HMC)
and brain-computer interface (BCI). The commercially available electroencephalograph (EEG) Emotiv EPOC headset was
evaluated by Carrino et al. in 2012 [49], and at that time
could not be used successfully for self-paced applications too
sensitive to error.
State-of-the-art BCI can even be used to monitor the user’s
emotional state [45], [57], such that when the user is frustrated

the control unit will stop the wheelchair and wait for a new
command from the user. In the other case, the control unit will
continue executing the previously selected command.
Deictic control enables the user to move with a series of indications on an interface displaying a view of the environment,
bringing about automatic movement of the wheelchair [8].
Cloud-based mobile devices [56] have been proposed for direct
control of the SW, for remote monitoring, and to help serve
as an emergency warning system. Brazil’s Hefestos [52] has a
user interface that communicates with the electric wheelchair
firmware via integrated Android app. With it the user can
control the wheelchairs’ operation from widgets on the touch
screen of the user’s mobile device.
Many SWs fuse information from internal sensors (Odometer, IMU (Fig. 3a,b)) with multiple external sensors to locate
obstacles, and provide accurate localization even when one or
more of the sensors are operating with large uncertainty.
A promising method of obstacle detection is a combination
of a low-tech, inexpensive optical USB camera and sophisticated machine vision software [15].
Others like Ding et al. [35] envision a personalized
wheelchair navigation system based on a PDA equipped with
wireless internet access and GPS that can provide adaptive
navigation support to wheelchair users in any geographic
environment. Modern smart phones come standard with sensors
built in that can be used to supply data about a SW’s activities
[85].
Using a stereoscopic camera and spherical vision system
[50], 3D scanners like Microsoft’s Kinect (Fig. 3c), laser
rangefinders (LRFs) [15] (Fig. 3d), and most recently the
Structure 3D scanner, it has become possible to use point cloud
data to detect hazards like holes, stairs, or obstacles [51] (Fig.
4). These sensors have until recently been relatively expensive,

were large and would consume a lot of power. The Kinect was
found to be an effective tool for target tracking, localization,
mapping and navigation [110]–[112].
In general, numerous advanced input methods have been
developed to serve a wide range of SW users. It would
be better if users can control the SW without giving many
commands. Therefore, SW research in the future should focus
on minimizing the need for users to provide continuous input
commands. SWs should include operating modes that can be
trained from users’ daily activities to be able to self-operate in
most situations.
V. O PERATING MODES
Operating modes range from autonomous to semiautonomous depending on the abilities of the user and the
task at hand. Table V lists subtopics and example references
in the field of SW operating mode research. Users who lack
the ability to plan or execute a path to a destination benefit
most from an autonomous system, but only if they spend the
majority of their time within the same controlled environment.
If the user can effectively plan and execute a path to a
destination it may be more beneficial to have a system that
is confined to collision avoidance [106], [113]. Ideally the
design should be based around each individual user’s abilities
and desires, maximizing the amount of control they are given,
while offering the user help, as and when it is required [36].

Among some of the SWs offering semi-autonomous navigation, users may take the additional step of selecting from
distinct operating modes depending on the task [15]. Operating
modes reported to date include:
A. Machine learning
What makes a wheelchair smart is not just a collection of
hardware, but specialized computer algorithms that provide the
artificial intelligence needed to make split-second decisions
about where the wheelchair is heading, and what might be
in its way.
Some examples of machine learning in SWs include the
use of neural networks to detect obstacles [50], and reproduce
pretaught routes [124]; some use obstacle density histograms
to combine information from sonar sensors, and joystick input
from the user [113]; while others use rulebased approaches.
The LIASD SW has a control architecture that uses the virtual
impedance principal [114]. This approach ensures a smooth
implementation of desired tasks by taking into account some
real impedance parameter properties such as inertia, viscosity
and stiffness. Tyagi et al. 2013 [54] use fuzzy control, which
allows the use of inexpensive and imprecise sensors, keeping
the overall system cost and complexity low.
Most SWs use reactive control methods, like subsumptive
architectures, as the lowest layer of a multilayer architecture
[15]. This layer interacts directly with the underlying hardware,
while upper layers provide deliberative reasoning and control.
Tang et al. 2012 [48] introduce a system that makes extensive
use of freely available opensource software. The Player Project
has as the base framework: GMapping for mapping, Vector
Field Histograms for obstacle avoidance, and Wavefront for
path planning.
B. Following
Several SWs [38], [61], [115], [117] have been developed
that can follow alongside a companion. The SW can track
the companion’s body position/orientation using laser range
sensors based on Kalman filter and data association estimate
the guide’s footprint. Based on position data of the footprint,
a cubic spline generates a target path for the wheelchair. The
wheelchair is controlled so that it can move along the guide
footprint at a constant gap between the wheelchair and the
guide.
In another case, a new methodology was developed [116]
that allows a wheelchair, which does not have a prior knowledge of the companion’s destination, to move with companions
collaboratively using a destination estimation model based on
observations of human’s daily behaviors.
To serve a large group of people with disabilities at the same
time, multi-wheelchair formation controls were developed to
enable easy communication with companions [125]. Controlling the wheelchairs while maintaining formation is done by
plotting a path p defined by the model trajectory, and then
calculating a path for each wheelchair (p1 , p2 ) a small distance
from p [60], [126], [127].

C. Localization and mapping
A major challenge is the development of a robust, reliable
localization and navigation system in both indoor and outdoor
environments. Since the SW needs to safely navigate on
roads/sidewalks, it is required that the localization accuracy
be within a range of a few centimeters. The main challenge
for outdoor localization is that the global positioning systems
(GPS) are not always reliable and robust, especially in tree covered environments. The GPS measurements are integrated with
attitude information from the onboard inertial measurement
unit (IMU) to enhance the localization accuracy. Moreover,
the developed navigation system also fuses the GPS/IMU
measurements with the wheel odometry information through an
extended Kalman filter (EKF) design [128], [129]. Utilizing the
odometry-enhanced fusion, the SW will achieve high-accuracy
localization even in GPS-denied environments [130]–[132].

obstacle and a few bumps is shown side-by-side with a point

3D point cloud data can also be displayed as a 2D birds eye
view of the SW’s environment [50] (Fig. 5). From left to right

Prompter: uses a Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP) to determine the optimal prompting
strategy. Specifically, this module estimates the users’
ability level to navigate to the goal independently based
on past errors, and responsiveness to prompts in order
to select appropriate audio prompts to assist the users in
navigation.
Jain et al. 2014 [68] present an algorithm for the automated
detection of safe docking locations at rectangular and circular docking structures (tables, desks) with proper alignment
information using 3D point cloud data. Based on geometric
information, computed from depth data, the method is invariant
to scene or lighting changes. It does not make use of fiducial
landmarks, or simplify the problem by using customized docking structures [123]. The safe docking locations can then be
provided as goals to an autonomous path planner.
The same docking principals also apply to the joining of
a SW with a transport vehicle like a van or bus. Gao et al.
2007 [34] devised a LIDAR based Automated Transport and
Retrieval System (ATRS) as an alternative to van conversions
for automobile drivers.
Poorten et al. 2012 introduces a set of novel haptic guidance
algorithms intended to provide intuitive and reliable assistance
for PW navigation through narrow or crowded spaces. Tomari
et al. 2014 [67] propose a method of navigation in crowded
indoor environments based on the observation of people’s head
information obtained from color and range images. Initially
head regions in the color image are tracked and their orientations are estimated, then the head orientation data are integrated
with the head position data in the range image to determine
the wheelchair motion so that it can smoothly move among
humans.
In each operating mode, a huge number of achievements
have been made to improve the SW’s functionality. Due to
current sensor capabilities limiting autonomous navigation to
indoor environments, combining all of the above advancements
can result in autonomous navigation through all environments.
Thus, autonomous navigation would be one of the main focuses of future SW research. Furthermore, some SW users
still significantly depend on caregivers, especially people with
quadriplegia. While robotic technology will not completely
replace human caregivers, it can help to extend the time that
an individual can spend in independent living situations [135].

previously uncharted room, continuously building a map, and
keeping a record of obstacles for later reference when they are
out of range of vision. Between frames 1 and 2 the pilot turns
side to side to collect data.
Using spherical vision cameras like the BGR Ladybug2
[134] and applying methods like the improved Prewitt edge
detection [121], SWs can detect obstacles in most indoor
environments [50] (Fig. 6).
D. Navigational assistance
An elegant application of semi autonomous obstacle avoidance was accomplished by Rofer et al. 2009 [122] for a rearwheel drive SW, where the front active castor wheels are
always rotated by motors to match the orientation of the current
driving direction.
Viswanathan et al 2011. [43] run multiple processes in a
distributed fashion on a Nimble Rocket T M that serve people
with visual impairments particularly well.
•

•

Collision Detector: detects frontal collisions and stops the
wheelchair if an object is detected within a distance of
approximately 1 meter, preventing motion in the direction
of the obstacle through the controller.
Path Planner: given a global map of the environment and
an initial position estimate, visual odometry produce the
optimal route to the specified goal location. The trajectory
is analyzed to determine deviations from the optimal route
as well as upcoming turns.

VI. H UMAN FACTORS IN S MART W HEELCHAIR
As the population of industrialized countries ages, the number of adults living with mobility impairment is increasing,
with an estimated 2.8 million Americans residing outside
of institutions utilize wheelchairs as an assistive technology
device [136]. This population includes, but is not limited to,
individuals with low vision, visual field neglect, spasticity,
tremors, or cognitive deficits. Challenges to safe, independent
wheelchair use can result from various overlapping physical, perceptual, or cognitive symptoms of diagnoses such as
spinal cord injury, cerebrovascular accident, multiple sclerosis,
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and cerebral palsy. Persons with
different symptom combinations can benefit from different
types of assistance from a SW and different wheelchair form

7

factors [69], [137], [138]. Manual and powered wheelchairs are
standard approaches to address such impairments, but these
technologies are unsuitable for many users [139]. While the
needs of some individuals with disabilities can be satisfied with
PWs, many people with disabilities (about 40% of the disabled
community [140]) find operating a standard PW difficult or
impossible (Fig. 7).
In the past SWs have simply been considered mobile robots
that are transformed “by adding a seat”. The main difference
between a SW and a robot with a seat is that a wheelchair is an
extension of the human being sitting in it and he or she must
feel comfortable using it. Thus, human factors are a crucial
component in the design and development of a SW [141]–
[144]. Table VI lists subtopics and example references in the
field of SW human factor research.

A. Human Robot Interaction
A recent meta-analysis of the available literature on trust and
human-robot interaction (HRI) found that robot performance
and attributes were the largest contributors to the development
of trust in HRI. Environmental factors played only a moderate
role [145].
In a discussion on the unique technical, ethical, and legal
challenges facing HRI practitioners when designing robots for
human social environments, Riek et al. 2014 argue that the
affordance of all rights and protections ordinarily assumed in
human-human interactions apply to human-robot interaction,
and propose a code of ethics for the profession [146].
Robots intended to provide physical assistance to people
with disabilities present a unique set of ethical challenges to
HRI practitioners. Robots may be used for daily living tasks,
such as bathing, manipulation, mobility and other activities
to support independent living and aging-in-place. The design
of physically assistive robots must, therefore, take into consideration the privacy rights of clients, as with, perhaps, the
deactivation of video monitors during intimate procedures.
B. Learning
A team of 18 clinical researchers at the University of British
Columbia have developed a program of research that will
use a mixed-methods approach, including lab-based, qualitative and quantitative methodologies, spanning 5 key research
projects. Their plan is to assess the effectiveness of their new,
collaboratively-controlled wheelchair, in combination with the
Wheelchair Skills Program [148].
Gironimo et al. 2013 at the University of Naples use virtual
reality based experiments in which they collect quantitative
measures of users operating a wheelchair-mounted robot manipulator, followed by subjective user evaluations intended to

maximize the effectiveness, the efficiency, and the satisfaction
of users [149].
Even if stable and safe wheelchair robots are realized,
integrating them in the world is difficult without acceptance
by the actual users: elderly people. Experimental results with
elderly participants at a pseudo resident home show that the
seniors prefer wheelchair robots programed to make appropriate utterances to reduce their anxieties. Seniors also preferred
an adaptable wheeling speed, since speed preference varies for
each individual [154].
C. Physiology
PW users are involved in some accidents once in a while.
Most common are falls off of the wheelchair due to inclined
surfaces (Fig. 7-a,b), so researchers at the Kyoto Institute
of Technology measure the physiological indices when the
wheelchair is inclined, in order to evaluate the physical strains
on the human body [152]. Their results show that even though
the contact area does not get higher as the incline angle gets
higher, the distribution of high pressure area gets lower as the
angle gets higher, therefore people feel uncomfortable as the
inclination gets higher.
Older adults typically receive little or no mobility training
when they receive a wheelchair, and are therefore more likely
to experience an accident. In order to accommodate this
underserved population Giesbrecht et al. 2014 [153] developed
a therapist-monitored wheelchair skills home training program
delivered via a computer tablet. To optimize efficacy and
adherence, principles of self-efficacy and adult learning theory
were foundational in the program design.
A study with 23 participants by Meike Jipp of the German
Aerospace Center in 2012 found that participants with lower
fine motor abilities had more collisions and required more
time for reaching goals. Adapting the wheelchair’s level of
automation to these fine motor abilities can improve indoor
safety and efficiency [151].
D. Social issues
A 2014 study of data in the form of 55 letters from 33
Danish citizens applying for assistive technology established
the following as core aspects of user perspectives on assistive
devices: quality of life, realization of personal goals, keeping
up roles, positive self image, personal dignity, independence,
activities and participation, self-care and security, lack of
access in surroundings, professional domination of assistive
device area, cultural stigma of negative symbolic value, and
cumbersome standardized devices [155].
The program identifies several factors that will impede
participation in public activities by a person with a mobility
impairment.
• Individual: compromised body function and structure related to pain, strength, and endurance.
• Built environment: inaccessible locations, and challenging
terrain.
• Social environment: social attitudes and level of personal
assistance.
• Assistive technology devices including wheelchairs that
are low-quality and inappropriate or do not fit the user.

Contextual factors: age and confidence (self-efficacy) with
wheelchair use.

E. Commercialization
There are three reasons to purchase a SW, each requiring a
different behavior:
1) Mobility aid, helps the user reach a destination as quickly
and comfortably as possible.
2) Training tool, helps the user develop specific skills. The
amount of user input required is a function of the training
activity.
3) Evaluation instrument, records activity without intervention.

In general, apart from current technological issues, nontechnical barriers also hamper commercialization. Prescribers
and insurance providers want to avoid liability, and want proof
that the SW technology works. A SW may be tested a thousand
times without a user, under laboratory conditions, but it is
more difficult to find a real human subject to participate in the
trials. With very few trial participants, data has been difficult
to collect, and insurers reluctant to provide reimbursement.
Meanwhile, policymakers are concerned about the increasing
demand for unnecessarily elaborate wheelchairs [159], and
since SW studies are considered human trials, they are subject
to strict government regulations [160].

Smile Rehab’s SW is the only SW available to the consumer
(see Table VII), because the technology is still expensive,
and sensor capabilities limit autonomous navigation to indoor
environments, that have to be modified by putting down tape.
Another downside is that the consumer has to use Smile
Rehab’s PW platform.
Henderson et al. 2014 [65] are providing researchers with an
embedded system that is fully compatible, and communicates
seamlessly with current manufacturer’s wheelchair systems.
Their system is not commercially available, but researchers
can mount various inertial and environmental sensors, and
run guidance and navigation algorithms which can modify the
human desired joystick trajectory, to help users avoid obstacles,
and move from room to room. SWs should be customized to
each consumer, making it really difficult to expand a business
or lower the cost of a SW (by mass production).
Toyota Motor East Japan Inc. [21], a manufacturing subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, has gotten into the
personal electric vehicle (PEV) business (Fig. 1e), which
demonstrates that there is a market for technology very similar
the ideal SW, a PEV modified for use indoors by an individual
with a disability.

A study conducted by Worcester Polytechnic Institute
(WPI) [135] showed that users who are accustomed to their
wheelchairs have little to no tolerance for the failures of “new
features,” which means full autonomy plays an important role
in users’ acceptability. Overall, people are open to using a
robot that assists them in performing a task in an environment
with other humans. These ”Co-robots” provide their user with
independent mobility. SWs have to be safe and their operations
must be reliable under any conceivable circumstance. This is
especially true for SWs, where the user has a disability and
may be quite frail. To emphasize these trends, we propose
and discuss the following future directions which would be
the priorities for SW research.
A. Autonomous Navigation
Current PW users still have many difficulties with daily maneuvering tasks (Fig. 7), and would benefit from an automated
navigation system. Future SW users will be able to select from
several autonomous or semi-autonomous operating modes,
using the input methods they are most comfortable with.
They will direct their SW to navigate along preprogrammed
routes with little physical or cognitive effort indoors and out,
passing through doors and up-and-down elevators. The SW
will communicate with the user when it is appropriate in order
to reduce anxiety, and build an individualized profile. These
profiles will track such variables as preferred input method,
wheeling speed, turning speed, and amount of verbal feedback,
just to name a few.
One of the downsides of the earlier work in SWs and
autonomous driving [4], [6], [10], [11], [32], [115]–[117],

9

between human users and SWs have to be investigated [171],
[172]. MMP can obtain an understanding of the connection
between visual and linguistic data [60], [173] and combine
them to achieve improved sensing and expression with a SW.

Fig. 8. Example diagram of the human-iChair interaction model.

[161]–[163] has been that the environment had to be permanently modified in order for the wheelchair to navigate independently. Future research plans should focus on developing
novel navigation algorithms to allow SWs to autonomously
and safely navigate in complex environments. These are not
trivial tasks since they require online calibration [164], [165]
and sensor fusion of multiple sensor sources including laser
scanners, camera, IMU, encoder and GPS, etc. Fortunately,
the navigation algorithms developed for SWs could inherit
the advanced performances of previous works on autonomous
navigation for the robots [130], [131] and or autonomous cars.
B. Human-Smart Wheelchair Interaction Model
The human-SW interaction model plays a vital role in the
formation of a SW. The reinforcement learning technique
[166], [167] could be utilized to build an efficient interaction
model between user and SW. The developed model may take
into account sensor feedbacks, such as from Emotive sensors
[168] and various environment sensing sensors including Oculus virtual reality sensors, laser scanners, cameras and global
positioning system (GPS). The SW uses these control signals to
navigate and operate its robotic arms (see Fig. 8). Human user
thinking will be captured and analyzed through an advanced
signal processing model [4]. The output signals will control
the operations of the SW including wheel motors as well as
robotic arms. A shared control scheme could be developed to
allow effective collaboration between user and SW, as well as
to adapt SW’s assistance to the variations in user performance
and environmental changes.
A real-time Multi-Modal Perception (MMP) model should
be used to deal with uncertainty in sensing, which is one
of the most enduring challenges. The perceptual challenges
are particularly complex, because of the need to perceive,
understand, and react to human activity in real-time. The
range of sensor inputs for human interaction is far larger than
for most other robotic domains in use today. MMP inputs
include human thought, speech and vision, etc., which are
major open challenges for real-time data processing. Computer
vision methods processing human-oriented data such as facial
expression [169] and gestures recognition [170] will need to be
developed to handle a vast range of possible inputs and situations. Additionally, language understanding and dialog systems

Fig. 9. From left to right: four iChair Australia Editions (AE)s, two sitting,
one with roof up, one with roof down, and two standing, one with roof down
and the other up, all in I-formation behind a human guide. The iChair AE
includes the Retractable Roof with Heads-up Display (RR& HD), Robotic
Arm Assistant (RAA), Ladybug2 and 2 Bumblebee sensors, mounted on a
Levo C3 power wheelchair with standing ability. Shown with joystick, HCI
and tablet running voice control, head tracking, and an Android app with a
menu of options such as: drive options, maps, sensors, RR, HD, RAA.

C. Smart Wheelchair with Smart Home
SWs will be integrated into the smart home, providing
a seamless user experience and control over all household
appliances. When the users are outdoor a retractable roof will
provide shelter from the elements, and additional safety at
night while driving in traffic. Optical stereoscopic and spherical
vision imagery will be combined with infrared laser data to
produce a virtual point cloud matrix of the user’s surroundings.
Objects in the matrix are identified using machine vision, visual tracking, and gesture recognition algorithms. Localization
information from the IMU and GPS, onboard data collected,
and bluetooth beacon data flooding public spaces, will all
help guide the SW to a particular destination. Fig. 9 is a
3D rendering of a standing SW with a retractable roof and
robotic arms that will allow users with disabilities of all types
to independently perform many more daily living activities.
We believe that given liability concerns, SWs in the future
should be treated like PEVs that are registered and insured.
Users should be certified, or licensed, for operation after
passing a standardized wheelchair skills test [11], [148].
VIII. C ONCLUSION
SWs represent a paradigm shift unlike the one that occurred
when power wheelchairs became available on a mass scale,
which was a technological advancement from the manual
wheelchair. In the last decade sensors and computers have
gotten faster, cheaper, and smaller, while computer vision
software has become more sophisticated and readily available
than ever before. The research community has developed many
prototypes, the best parts of which should be fused into a modular upgradable system that can be marketed to the millions of
people who need PWs. Electric vehicle manufacturers are in a
prime position to produce a stand-alone SW, and capitalize on
the millions of aging Babyboomers worldwide, who will want
to have a SW.
The best SWs will be able to accommodate people with
all disability types by utilizing a multi-modal interface that
combines computer vision, touch, voice, and brain control.
SWs will be able to build 3D maps using mobile scanners,

10

and navigate autonomously by streaming and analyzing sensory
data in real-time through cloud computing applications. These
solutions show much promise to significantly improve the
quality of life for people who use PWs, but only if they are
trusted by the people they were designed to serve. This means
that human factors have be taken into account, so SWs should
be customizable to the individual user’s preferences, provide
verbal feedback when appropriate, and be mountable on any
PW. The stage is set for humans and robots to interact in public
spaces in order to give people with disabilities the best quality
of life possible, and the opportunity to maximize their human
potential.
