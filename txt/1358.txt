Abstract: The Open-electroencephalography (EEG) framework is a popular platform to enable EEG
measurements and general purposes Brain Computer Interface experimentations. However, the
current platform is limited by the number of available channels and electrode compatibility. In this
paper we present a fully configurable platform with up to 32 EEG channels and compatibility with
virtually any kind of passive electrodes including textile, rubber and contactless electrodes. Together
with the full hardware details, results and performance on a single volunteer participant (limited to
alpha wave elicitation), we present the brain computer interface (BCI)2000 EEG source driver together
with source code as well as the compiled (.exe). In addition, all the necessary device firmware, gerbers
and bill of materials for the full reproducibility of the presented hardware is included. Furthermore,
the end user can vary the dry-electrode reference circuitry, circuit bandwidth as well as sample rate
to adapt the device to other generalized biopotential measurements. Although, not implemented
in the tested prototype, the Biomedical Analogue to Digital Converter BIOADC naturally supports
SPI communication for an additional 32 channels including the gain controller. In the appendix we
describe the necessary modification to the presented hardware to enable this function.

1. Introduction
Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are increasingly being used in numerous applications,
ranging from typical clinical applications, e.g., the diagnosis and treatment of brain function anomalies
such as seizures, to experimental applications like brain computer interfaces (BCIs) and neurofeedback,
which aim to either augment the effective pathways of the human brain by adding non-standard
output channels via a computer program, or to increase the performances of a wearer, i.e., meditation
feedback [1–11]. For these reasons, BCI/neurofeedback systems are becoming increasingly popular.
There are many open-access/source BCI systems that allow those with neurological impairment to

have effective communication, as well as systems to aid able-bodied subjects who want to explore the
benefits of direct brain to computer communication [12–16].
A substantial difficulty with recording EEGs is that the signal itself is of a very small amplitude,
usually in the order of a few tens of micro-Volts (smaller for evoked potentials used for some BCIs) and
are easily corrupted by noise. This necessitates careful scalp/skin preparation, the use of conductive
gel/paste, and ultimately, glues, to hold the electrodes firm to the skin and avoid the skidding of
electrodes [3,17–19]. The use of gel/paste and glue can lead to additional problems, such as conductive
gel desiccation, and a loss of adhesion leading to an increase in the contact impedance between the
electrodes and scalp, which in turn may lead to a large reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio. Short
circuits can also occur between neighboring electrodes due to sweat or smearing of the conductive
gel [10,19].
Many of these additional problems can be minimized by using dry electrode systems, and some
recent studies have shown working prototypes also suitable for EEG [1,4,8,20–30]. Of course, the use
of fully “loose” dry electrodes is not immune from artifacts. In previous studies we demonstrated
a reduction in the effect of momentary loss of scalp contact due to movements and/or skin stretching
by scalp muscle artifacts (i.g., blinking) by developing a lightweight custom-made dry electrode that,
by being flat and flexible, was suitable for direct gluing onto the scalp using standard collodion glue
cured with a brief oxygen application (readily available in the hospital prep room used for our clinical
study) [4,10,19].
Recently, gold plated or Ag/AgCl hair penetrative electrodes that look like small hair-combs,
with rounded spikes capable of effectively penetrating hair to avoid hair matting under the
electrode, have become commercially available (i.g. the gTEC Sahara electrodes http://www.
gtec.at/Products/Electrodes-and-Sensors/g.SAHARA-Specs-Features and Ag/AgCl dry electrodes
https://shop.openbci.com/); when these electrodes are paired with a suitable analogue front-end,
they can measure EEG without the use of conductive gel/paste or glue. To hold the electrode in the
designed places, either specialized EEG-caps or standard rubber tube “head nets” can be employed;
connection to the electronic front-end is usually made with alligator or pop-fastener clips.
To allow compatibility with both standard wet electrodes as well as commercially available and
“home-brew” dry electrodes, such as ones made of spring-loaded pins, jacks, or other “Do It Yourself”
solutions that are quite popular among OpenEEG users (http://openeeg.sourceforge.net/doc/hw/
electrodes/passive/), we designed an 8-channel module (users can daisy-chain modules in multiples
of eight channels) based upon our early passive dry electrode technology [4,22,31–35]. The front-end
that we designed is immune to contact impedance imbalance, and in previous trials on animals it
has been able to detect fetal electrocardiographic signals in pregnant dairy and beef cattle without
the need to prepare/shave the cow using hair penetrative electrodes similar to the ones that now are
commercially available for EEG purposes [36].
Like our previous designs, the front-end exploits the peculiarity of the INA116 instrumentation
amplifier [37] to enable reference electrode replication without additional hardware (see methods
section) [4,20–23,31–33,36,38]. Although we previously implemented a modified voltage supply
bootstrap to make the driven right leg electrode and/or body grounding unnecessary [39], in this
design we also implemented a driven right leg connection as an optional aid for further improvement
of the signal to noise ratio that could be of use in difficult EEG/BCI recordings that make use of
evoked responses known to be among the faintest EEG signals, requiring signal averaging to be clearly
measured [9,40–50].
In order to process the acquired EEG signals, the analogue signals need to be digitized and sent to
a computer that is the central processing unit of a BCI. For this purpose, we have selected BCI2000
(www.bci2000.org), which is probably the most well-known, general purpose rapid prototyping BCI
software [14]. In order to use BCI2000, a specialized bridge software is required to interface the
digital converter of choice to the core of the software. Several commercial and popular hardware
solutions (including the Open-EEG hardware http://openeeg.sourceforge.net/), are already included

Sensors 2019, 19, 772

in BCI2000; in order to use our BIOADC we needed to write our own bridge software using the supplied
code template [14,51,52]. The BIOADC is an open source, 32-channel analogue to digital converter
(ADC) that supports programmable gain control for all the channels. In our original implementation,
the system was intended to be stand-alone; hence, it was paired with a supporting ARM processor
to record the data on an SD card. However, the device can be also connected (with galvanically
isolated connection) to a standard USB port and hence to a standard computer [51]. To allow full
reproduction of the hardware, all the production files and bill of materials for both boards, BIOADC,
and the analogue electrodes’ front-end are included together with the firmware and the necessary
BCI2000 device driver as both source code and compiled code.
With this work, taking all the best features of our previous analogue front-end designs, we present
a single module with ultra-high input impedance, suitable for virtually any dry electrode, that allows
for simultaneous use of differential inputs, as well as unipolar inputs and user programmable gain
when combined with the BIOADC, which is also fully compatible with BCI2000. Therefore, in this
paper, we will briefly summarize the hardware design for the BIOADC limited to the board used—the
original BIOADC used two (see Section 2.2)—as well as for the dry electrodes’ front-end that is a new
design (see Section 2.1); we then present the validation bench tests employing suitable signal generators,
as well as some EEG tests limited to alpha-wave elicitation that demonstrates the suitability of our
proposed hardware for EEG measurements [49].
2. Methods
In this section we present the electronic hardware for both the BIOADC and the analogue
front-end; we then explain, in detail, the manufacturing of the electrode cap used for our experiments
together with all the necessary bench tests and alpha-wave elicitation tests. In appendix we also present
an improvement to the proposed hardware to enable digital gain control as well as a comparison of
our hardware with some commercially available devices.
2.1. Analogue Front-End
The analogue front-end is designed around the INA116 instrumentation amplifier by TI [37].
The schematic for a single channel is depicted in Figure 1, where the INA116 is marked by the
designator U1. As can be observed from the schematic, the front-end is fully differential. To enable
reference to a single location on the head (e.g., linked mastoid, nose tip, or any arbitrary head electrode),
we exploit the embedded “active-guard” [38,51,52] feature present inside the INA116. In other words,
one of the channels is configured as fully differential; then the signal from the electrode connected
to the inverting input once buffered by the internal guard amplifier is fed to all the other channels’
inverting inputs. Although this design inherits several features from our previous designs [37,52], this
implementation is new and purposely designed for modular EEG/BCI and to suit the BIOADC.
In order to configure the selected channel to share the same reference signal, the jumper labeled
“In-D” (see Figure 1) must be closed, R3 populated, and the jumper labeled “In-S” open. When In-D
is closed, the signal at the output of the inverting input’s guard buffer can be used as a reference for
all the other channels. When In-S is closed, the inverting input of that selected channel is connected
to the reference signal, i.e., the one from an In-S of another channel. To prevent the general reference
electrode from being accounted multiple times in the voltage supply bootstrap and/or in the Driven
Right Leg (DRL), the resistor R3 should be populated only for the channel that is assumed as reference.
The reference replication technique is depicted in Figure 2, limited to two channels.
The weighted sum of all the connected electrodes is used to directly drive the battery common
node, thereby avoiding the connection of other electrodes to the head/body. To achieve this
configuration (modified voltage supply bootstrap that we successfully employed in other biopotential
circuits [10,11,19,31–36,38,40,51,52]), the selector jumper labeled “RLD-S” (see Figure 3) must be switched
to short pins one and two; then, the “RLD” header should be shorted using a jumper. In this configuration,
a direct body ground is possible, but an in-line resistor of 100 kΩ should be used between the electrode

Figure 5. Dry electrodes used for this project.

To place the electrodes on the head, we simply re-used the ventilation holes normally present
on a standard baseball cap. To enable rough standardized position of our EEG cap on the head, we
used the top button of the cap as a reference to be placed in correspondence with the standard EEG
electrode position Cz. The button was removed to enable visual localization of the Cz position, which
should be marked on the head as per standard EEG preparation. Of course, the position of electrodes
is not precise. However, for this paper we are not performing any BCI task and only recording alpha
waves to show the EEG recording capabilities of our device. To perform proper BCI, electrode locations
should be carefully identified and/or a suitable EEG cap should be used.
3. Results
As mentioned, before testing on a volunteer subject, each of the eight channels was calibrated
to 1000 V/V using a differential signal generator (Function Generator Model 220 by MEDICAL
Instruments, Columbus, Ohio), capable of generating precise sine waves of 1 mVpp at the EEG
frequency range. For calibration the circuit reference ground was tied to the signal generator ground

Like any biopotential, the EEG is affected by power-line noise; all the data presented are

placement, which will enable reproducibility of BCI tasks that are highly dependent from the specific
brain area, e.g., P300 BCIs.
Although precise micro-volts measurements of EEG potentials are normally used only in clinical
practice, being able to increase/reduce the signal gain according to the experimental condition
is a desirable feature. For this reason, the proposed hardware can be further modified to enable
programmable gain amplifier (PGA) functions and software fine gain tuning (see Appendix A).
As with every design, there are limits and drawbacks. The major limitation of this design is its size.
One may note that many of the proposed functions, such as multiple channels, PGA functionality, and
direct analogue to digital conversions, are presently implemented in integrated biopotential front-ends
like the ADS1299 by TI (http://www.ti.com/product/ADS1299). However, fully integrated solutions,
while they can be cost effective and size effective, may not be compatible with passive dry electrodes,
and may come in packages (e.g., Ball Grid Array BGA) that are prohibitive for labs where electronic
support is not available. For Instance, ADS1299 bias current is 300 pA; this value is due to a small input
impedance that may not be suitable for dry passive electrodes. In addition, the proposed analogue
front-end is not entirely dedicated to EEG electrodes, allowing unipolar channels to be mixed with
differential channel, and enabling the full human interface paradigm within the popular BCI2000
software. In Appendix B a comparison of our proposed hardware with some commercially available is
detailed together with an example of BCI application.

Appendix A. PGA Modification
One way to transform each of the EEG front-ends into a programmable gain amplifier controlled
by the BIOADC is to replace the gain potentiometers for the INA116 with a digitally controlled
potentiometer. The BIOADC base firmware (source code available upon request) includes direct
support for up to 32 SPI digital potentiometers (individually addressable chip select) AD5290 [54] that
are capable to work with up to a 30 Vpp power supply. In this application, they can be used in their
10 kΩ variant, which would allow a minimum nominal gain for the EEG front-end of 600 V/V and
other larger 127 values. Please consult documentation for INA116 and AD5290.
Appendix B. Comparison with Some Popular EEG Systems and BCI2000 Test Run
A formal comparison with other systems would require a side by side serial or parallel recording
(see [5,6,10,49]). However, such formal comparison is outside the scope of this paper for several reasons;
principally, we should solve synchronization problems (many devices are wireless) as well as potential
ground loops between different circuit groundings, particularly when a DRL is used (only for parallel
recording [10]). Thus, we limited this comparison to the specifications as obtained by the manufacturer
website. According to the specifications listed in Table A1, our hardware has a noise figure in line
with the other EEG devices, but is the only one that with an impedance of >1015 /2 Ω/pF capable to
withstand an unbalance impedance of 109 Ω [4–11], and is the only one truly compatible with passive

Sensors 2019, 19, 772

12 of 16

electrodes. As it is possible to see from Table A1, many of the other front-ends, to enable dry electrodes,
use active additional electrodes, or they are limited to wet (saline infuse pads) electrodes.
In order to show how easy is to use our system, some of the authors and lab colleagues (six
participants in total) agreed to run a proper Mu-Rhythm BCI task. The selected task is embedded in
BCI2000 and consists of a single dimension (left/right) game, where the computer presents a random
target and the user moves a ball imagining hands movements. The task uses electrodes C3 and
C4, where the event related synchronizations and de-synchronizations due to the imaginary hands’
movements are supposed to be maximal [1,4,10,14,15]. To avoid precise measurement of the head, our
cap is been modified to cluster four electrodes in each of the areas where the targeted brain areas are.
The four channels have been added together and passed to the BCI signal process module using the
dedicated BCI2000 settings [14,32]. Set-up time was measured, and the quality of biopotential was
checked by simply asking the participant to produce jaw artifacts, as visible in Figure 6. Except for one
participant with bristly hair, set-up time was simply the time to wear the cap. For the participant with
longer bristly hair, we had to twist each electrode to allow scalp contact, and this required about two
minutes for the full set of eight electrodes.
Each of the participants was asked to complete two runs; the first run was a familiarization task
and was not used for BCI2000 performance analysis. Although a satisfactory EEG was recordable
from all the participants, when assessing BCI performances of the second run, two participants did
not perform better than random (~50%), while the other four showed a >63% correct target hit with
a subject (past trained for these kind of BCIs), scoring >75%, even in the test run.
