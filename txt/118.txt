ABSTRACT
Oscillations in the alpha range (8-15 Hz) have been found to appear prominently
in the EEG signal when people are awake with their eyes closed, and since
their discovery have been considered a fundamental cerebral rhythm. While
the mechanism of this oscillation continues to be debated, it has been shown
to bear positive relation to memory capacity, attention and a host of other
cognitive outcomes. Here we show that this feature is largely undetected in
the EEG of adults without post-primary education and access to modern
technologies. Furthermore, we show that the spatial extent and energy of the
oscillation have wide variation, with energy ranging over a thousand fold across
the breath of humanity with no centralizing mean. This represents a divergence
in a fundamental functional characteristic of an organ demonstrating both that
modernization has had a profound influence on brain dynamics and that a
meaningful ‘average’ human brain does not exist in a dynamical sense.

INTRODUCTION
Oscillations in the alpha range (8-15 Hz) were among the first visually observed phenomenon in
the dynamics of the human brain, described by Hans Berger shortly after he performed the very
first EEG recording in 1924 with the most primitive of instrumentation. These alpha oscillations
dominate the EEG signal during the awake, eyes-closed state and are considered today to be a
fundamental feature of human brain dynamics[1], referred to as the ‘archetypal cerebral rhythm’[2].
Easily measured today by EEG these oscillations emerge as a distinct peak in the power spectrum
of the signal with an average frequency of about 10.5 Hz. Unraveling the specific mechanisms and
role of this dominant rhythm of the human brain has since been of considerable interest. The peak
frequency has been shown to vary across individuals[3] and increasing evidence suggests that it
has broad relation to a number of cognitive capacities[1, 4]. Either the peak frequency or strength
of the oscillation have been found to correlate positively to working memory[5-7], attention[8-10]
and learning ability[11] and decline with increasing age[7]. In addition, lower levels of resting alpha
have been found in fragile X mental retardation syndrome[12] and in patients with Alzheimer’s
and amnesic mild cognitive impairment[13] as well as ADHD[14]. Finally, substantial evidence
now lends to the hypothesis that resting state alpha oscillations may correspond to an inhibition of
distracting information to allow sharpened internal focus and mental imagery[15].

Here we have evaluated the alpha oscillation under an eyes closed resting paradigm across a broad
range of human populations as part of a larger inquiry to understand the impact of modernization
on human brain dynamics. Modern civilization represents a very rapid shift in human experience

The discrete equivalent of the second derivative used is:
PSDf-PSDf-1

with the advent of larger urban agglomerations, more extended
formal education and a host of enabling technologies including
electricity, telecommunications and motorized transport. Access
to these experiences of modern life are largely linked to income,
a factor that is increasingly divergent across humanity. This study
therefore involved recording EEG from 402 adults between the
ages of 21 and 65 from across 48 settlements in India ranging from
remote hamlets to large cities. Participants in the study had annual
incomes spanning $300 to $150,000 and, correspondingly, a wide
range of access to formal education and modern technologies.
We have previously shown, using the same dataset, that the
complexity of the EEG waveform differs dramatically across
modern and pre-modern populations, separating into two distinct
distributions[16]. We asked here how the phenomenon of modern
civilization might have impacted the characteristics of the alpha
oscillation.

∆f
This method has the advantage over simply looking for the peak in
the PSD as it results in a magnification of the oscillation relative to
the characteristic 1/f decay of the power spectrum. Thus rather than
a total alpha power, this represents the oscillatory alpha component
that can be detected above the non-oscillatory component.
We then defined a measure of energy of the oscillation Eα as the sum
of the second order derivative ± 3.75 Hz from the peak detected
within the alpha band frequencies. Energy of a time series is
generally computed as the integral of the second derivative of the
amplitude with respect to time (Parseval’s formula). We thus use a
similar computation with respect to the frequency rather than time
to provide the energy of the oscillation. The analog formula would
be as follows.
Pα+3.75Hz
Eα =
∫
d2 (PSD(f)df)
Pα –3.75 Hz
where f is frequency. Its discrete equivalent is a summation across
the frequency range of 7.5 to 15.

We characterized both the peak frequency and energy of the alpha
oscillation in the EEG, finding surprisingly, that the alpha oscillation
was largely undetected in the EEG of populations that were premodern in their experience (and correspondingly low-income).
Furthermore, we found that the energy of the alpha oscillation
spanned over a 1000 fold range among our sample with no
centralizing mean indicating the absence of a meaningful average.

This method has an advantage over an integration of the power
spectrum density in that it amplifies the rate of change and therefore
minimizes the contribution of non-oscillatory alpha components.
Nonetheless, the α energy sometimes took on a nonzero value even
when there was no distinct peak detected since there was some
fluctuation in the power in the α range even if an oscillation did not
exist. Furthermore, it also captures information about the sharpness
or fidelity of the peak frequency and not just the overall strength.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sampling, Survey and EEG Recording
Data was gathered from 402 people across 48 settlements in the
State of Tamil Nadu, India including very small hamlets of only 300
people with no electricity or motorized transport as well as large
cities. Participants answered a series of questions regarding their
demographic, communication and mobility behavior in addition
to having EEG recorded for three minutes while they were awake
and seated with their eyes closed. In 20 people, 10 recording
were done in separate sessions over a week to assess intra-person
variability. The EEG recordings were carried out using the
Emotiv EPOC device. While the device has been shown to have
similar results to more expensive clinical grade systems[17-21],
we nonetheless performed validations by comparing results to
simultaneous recordings from the clinical grade Neuroscan device
along multiple dimensions with highly correlated results[16].
Survey methodology and sampling are described in more detail in
a companion paper [16].

We made assessments of the significance of differences between
groups using both the t-test as well as the non-parametric
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test given that not all the distributions
were normal in nature. For age and modernity where the groups
were >3, we performed an ANOVA (pANOVA) and also computed
the probability of finding a similarly significant separation if the
values were shuffled across participants pshuff. To do this the Pα
and Eα values were shuffled across participants 5000 times. Pshuff
represents the number of instances out of 5000 where the p-value
of the ANOVA value was ≤ the pANOVA of the actual data.

Alpha oscillation

Characterizing the Alpha Oscillation

Statistical Tests

RESULTS
The alpha oscillation or rhythm is most easily visualized in the
autocorrelation of the signal. Fig. 1A shows the autocorrelation
over a one second period of signal, averaged across channels, for
three participants in our study. For the first participant (top), the
autocorrelation is obviously dominated by an oscillation of ~10
Hz (10 cycles over the one second duration shown). For each
participant we analytically determined both the peak frequency
(Pα) of the oscillation for each channel and the energy (Eα) of the
oscillation. The energy can be thought of as a function of both the
amplitude and fidelity of the oscillation to a particular frequency
(see Methods).

To characterize the oscillation we first computed the discrete
fourier transform of the autocorrelation calculated over a 5 second
time window to obtain the power spectral density (PSD). To
then identify the peak frequency of the oscillation we computed
the discrete approximation of the second order derivative of the
PSD, and found the maximum between 7.5 and 15 Hz minus 2.
The analog formula is as follows:
Pα =Max (d2 (PSD(f)df)) - 2
where f is frequency.

Fig 1B shows Pα for each channel for each participant (each row is
a participant). Surprisingly we found that 20% of the participants
showed no evidence of an oscillation in any of the 14 channels
recorded, which can be seen as a smooth average autocorrelation
(Fig. 1A, bottom) and as grey in the matrix in 1B. Overall there
was large variation in the fraction of channels where an oscillation
was detected among participants spanning the spectrum from 0 to
100% (Fig. 1C). The oscillation was most consistently present in
the occipital region (O1,O2 Fig. 1C inset) followed by the frontal
and prefrontal areas. It was least present in the area T7 (left parietotemporal cortex).

significantly correlated with the peak value across channels (r=0.11).
To get deeper insight into the variation across the population
we recorded activity in ten separate instances over a one-week
period in 20 people. The 20 people selected were spread across
the spectrum of having the oscillation present in all channels in
the initial recording to being absent in all channels. In this subset,
when an oscillation was present we found an average Pα in the
sample of 10.62 Hz with an intra-person SD of 1.1, Hz in line with
previous studies[3]. However we found a very wide intra-person
variation in the number of channels where an oscillation was
detected (Fig. 2A-C). The fraction of channels with a detectable
peak across recordings varied across participants with individual
participants having a cross-recording mean ±SD of 0.92 ±0.06
(highest) to 0.12 ±0.1 (lowest). Across the sample, the oscillation
was present in at least one channel anywhere from 60% to 100% of
the time (Fig. 2C). That said, the average Pα was relatively stable
in most individuals with a median intra-person (cross-recording)
CV% of 6.05% compared to the median across individuals, which
was 15.4% (Fig. 2D).

For those channels that had a detectable oscillation, the average
peak frequency across participants (computed by averaging the
frequencies across those channels where it was detected) was 10.5
Hz, consistent with previous studies[3]. The standard deviation
(SD) and coefficient of variation (CV%) of Pα across participants
were 2 Hz and 19% respectively, again closely in line with previous
studies. However, clearly the presence of the oscillation varied greatly
across participants, and the fraction of channels with a peak was not

rather with implanted electrodes directly on the brain surface
recording local field potentials (LFPs) or electrocorticographs
(ECOG) at significantly higher spatial resolution, well below the
limits of detection of the non-invasive EEG. This suggests that this
feature is not sufficiently strongly developed in some people so as to
enable detection at the spatial resolution of the EEG.

Thus while there was wide variation, given that we did not find a
complete absence of the oscillation across all ten recordings in
any of the 20 individuals, this suggests that it is unlikely that some
human brains do not have the mechanism to produce the alpha
oscillation. Furthermore, evidence for alpha oscillations have been
found in other species as well, particularly monkeys [22, 23] leading
to the suggestion that it is an intrinsic property of the architecture
of the mammalian brain[24]. However, it is significant that these
recordings in other species have not been done with the EEG but

Taken together our results suggest a very broad continuum rather
than an absolute absence of the feature in some people.

Although studies have demonstrated differences in Pα across
regions [25], the alpha oscillation is most strongly present in the
occipital region making it possible that a very strong oscillation in
this region might be detected at other channels in the EEG simply
due to volume conduction. To rule this out we looked at the fraction
of channels at which an oscillation was detected as a function of the
energy of the oscillation in channels O1 and O2 (Fig. 4A). In both
cases (shown here is O2 which was stronger than O1 overall and
very similar), while a very strong oscillation in O1 or O2 (>250)
was overall more likely to be associated with oscillations detected
on more channels, it was nonetheless clear that oscillations could
often be present on all channels even when Eα of the occipital
region was very low. Furthermore, if detection of the oscillation at
other channels arose through volume conduction, Eα in O1 and O2
would be highly correlated to the Eα of other regions. However, the
mean occipital Eα compared to the mean Eα at other regions had a
linear R2 of only 0.37 (Fig. 4B) suggesting that oscillations detected
on other electrodes were largely mediated by other mechanisms.
In addition, peak frequencies while highly correlated within the
frontal/prefrontal and occipital regions, were not very correlated
across these two regions (Fig. 4C), which would not be expected if
the origin of frontal alpha were on account of volume transmission
from the occipital lobe. This is consistent with various reports that
suggest differences in the alpha oscillation frequency across brain
regions[3, 9, 26].

Fig. 3A shows the energy of the alpha oscillation (Eα) across
channels (columns) and participants (rows) ordered as in 1B
(see Methods for details of definition). Here again there was
large variation both across channels and participants. While the
measure is designed to amplify detection of the oscillation peak
rather than residual alpha component in the spectrum, in some
channels where a peak could not be detected, there was nonetheless
some residual energy in the alpha band. For channels with no
detectable alpha oscillation, Eα was normally distributed with a
mean ± SD of 21±9 (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, however, for those
channels where an alpha peak was detected, the average energy
across channels for all participants ranged from 10 to over 1350
in a distribution that was heavily skewed or long tailed with no
centralizing characteristic (Fig. 3C). The mean value (134±185)
is therefore not meaningful to this structure; the median was 67
and energy in an individual channel went as high as 5680. The
median intra-person CV% for the average Eα across channels was
56% compared to the median inter-person CV% of 137% (For.
3D) indicating that the differences across the population sampled
far exceeded the differences from recording to recording within
individuals. We also note that given that the distributions of Pα
and Eα were fundamentally different, these two measures were not
correlated (r = 0.09).

frequency of alpha
oscillation (Pα) between
all channels across
participants (considered
are only instances where a
peak was detected).

In the case of Eα , there was a weak decreasing trend with age.
However, while the overall trend was not significant in our
sample (ANOVA F=1.46, P= 0.22; pshuff = 0.22), the over 50 age
group was significantly lower than the under 30 group (Fig. 5D,F;
p= 0.023 by t-test).

We looked first at the features of the alpha oscillation as a
function of gender (Fig. 5A,B). Earlier studies have reported
slightly higher alpha frequency in adult females relative to
males[27]. While we found a similar directional difference, the
magnitude was not large enough to be significant in our dataset.
Pα was 10.27±0.10 for males and 10.71±0.19 for females (Fig 5A;
p= 0.22 by KS-test, 0.06 by t-test). Eα was 98.77±12 for males
and 93.36±11.15 for females (Fig. 5B; p= 0.67 by KS-test, 0.74
by t-test).

We also note that our sample was roughly equally split by age and
gender groups across all income groups such that these results
are not be likely to reflect other dimensions. Finally, we note
that despite the significance of the difference after age 50, the
magnitude of difference was not large enough to explain the very
wide range of differences across our sample.

We next looked at these parameters as a function of age (Fig.
5C, D). Previous studies have shown a decline with age, most
significantly beyond the age of 45[27]. Here we found that there
was no difference in Pα (counted only when it was present)
with age (Fig. 5C; ANOVA F=0.11, p= 0.95; pshuff = 0.95, see
methods for definition). The difference between the <30 group
(10.49±0.11) and the >50 group (10.47±0.35) had a p-value of
0.95 (by t-test).

THE ALPHA OSCILLATION
AND MODERNIZATION
The fundamental difference between our sample population and
those studied previously is that ours covered a large number of
people with low income and limited exposure to modern life.
We thus looked at the relationship between the peak and energy
of the oscillation and modernization by dividing our sample
into three groups of pre-modern, modern and transitioning
(Fig. 6). We defined pre-modern as groups with only a primary
education and below with no owned motorized vehicle or access
to electricity and telecommunication and modern as those who
were college educated or above with their own phone, vehicle
and electricity. ‘Transitioning’ were all others who fell between
these two extremes.

On the other hand, the fraction of channels with no detected
alpha oscillation did differ across age groups (initial value of
cumulative histogram in Fig. 5C.). Thus when the average Pα
was calculated including those channels with no detectable peak
as zeros, a decline beyond age 50 relative to the under 30 was
apparent (Fig. 5E; p = 0.0003 by t-test comparing <30 and >50;
ANOVA for all groups F=4.73, P= 0.003; pshuff <<0.0002).

DISCUSSION

The average Pα (when it was detected) was 10.28±0.31 for the
pre-modern group, 10.43±0.11 for the transitioning group
and 11.05 ±0.21 for the modern group. The pre-modern and
transitioning were not significantly different from one another
(p = 0.99 by KS test) but both together were significantly different
from the modern group (Fig. 6A; p≤0.0011 by KS test for both
comparisons). The overall group comparisons however were not
highly significant (ANOVA F = 2.55, p=0.11; pshuff = 0.20).

Here we have shown that the alpha oscillation, thought to be a
fundamentally ubiquitous and dominant feature of brain activity,
widely diverges across humanity in its presence in the EEG.
Furthermore, the energy of this oscillation has dramatic variance,
distributing across our sample with a 1000x range with no
centralizing mean. This raises a very fundamental question about
how one might define the ‘average’ human brain in a dynamical
context and the surprising answer that it perhaps does not exist.
Unlike other organs, such as the heart, where dynamical markers
of function might be easily used to create benchmarks that guide
diagnosis of normal and disease states, using such a marker for the
brain poses unique problems. These results suggest that ‘normal’
may have to be related to the specific context of human experience.

On the other hand, the average Pα across all channels,
including those with no detected oscillations (i.e. Pα =0),
was significantly higher for the modern group (8.45±0.61)
compared to both the pre-modern (3.91±0.95) and
transitioning groups (4.56±0.21), (p=3.62x10-6 by KS test,
ANOVA F = 14.84, p = 6.21x10 -7; p shuff <<0.0002). Whereas a
peak was always detected in at least one channel in ~97% of
those in the modern group, it was entirely absent in ~20.17%
of the pre-modern and transitioning groups.

Our most significant finding, however, is that the ubiquitous
emergence of this feature is related to modern experience.
Considering that the alpha oscillation has several cognitive
implications, this suggests that modern experience may change
the cognitive capacity of the human brain quite profoundly. This
is even more poignant when one considers that while modern
civilization has emerged only over the past 200 years, it has not
done so uniformly across the globe. Furthermore, with incomes
having diverged so dramatically over the past century structuring
as a long tailed distribution, it is only a minority of humans that
have the ability to afford all the tools of modern living. Indeed,
only 15-20% of humanity today would be considered ‘modern’
by our definition. With the average weighted Pα across channels
shifting nonlinearly and clear evidence for the functional cognitive
associations with the alpha oscillations, this suggests that we might
be diverging into populations of distinct and divergent modes
of cognitive functioning. It is also of significance that the alpha
oscillation is not typically present in young children, emerging
only after age five and growing over childhood to reach maturity
in later years [27]. This suggests that it is largely an experience
dependent phenomenon of the brain. This would have serious
implications for how we approach education and social policy
across different populations.

More dramatically, only 40% of the pre-modern and transitioning
groups had Eα beyond the non-oscillatory residual alpha energy
level (defined as 2SD from the mean, here 39) while this was so
for 93.3% of the modern group (Fig. 6B). Eα was 64.44±21.5
for the pre-modern group and 81.49±7.2 for the transitioning
group, which were not significantly different (p=0.9 KS-test). In
contrast both were dramatically lower than the modern group,
which had Eα of 278.75 ±56.8 (p = .001 t-test, 3.2x10-7 KS-test,
ANOVA F= 24, p = 2.1x10-10; pshuff <<0.0002).
The weighted Pα (average Pα weighted by Eα and including
channels with Pα = 0 (i.e. no oscillation) was 4.53±1.05 for the
pre-modern group, 5.40±0.23 for the transitioning group and
9.58±0.57 for the modern group (Fig. 6C).
Thus, taken together, the presence, peak and energy of the alpha
oscillation is closely associated with access to features of modern
living and its domination of the resting EEG may not simply be
an intrinsic consequence of being born human but rather highly
dependent on the context into which the person is born and
raised.
The largest driving force with respect to access to the features
of modernity is income, since all of the tools of modernity must
largely be purchased. Fig. 6D shows the cumulative income
distributions of each group in our sample. 65% of the pre-modern
group had incomes under $5/day while the rest had incomes
between $5 and $10/day. Incomes in the transitioning group were
also largely under $10/day although 10% had incomes above $10.
In contrast only 7% of the modern group had incomes below
$30/day. This pattern suggests that there is a certain threshold
of income that may be required to have sufficient access to the
tools of modernity and thereby drive a rapid change in alpha
oscillations.

Parsing the effects of different aspects of modernization such
as education and technology will therefore be of considerable
interest, as also a deeper understanding of the implications of this
divergence for various types of cognitive abilities.

the presence of the alpha oscillation in the resting state across
humanity that is markedly stronger in those beyond a certain

civilization.
