Abstract. Vigilance or sustained attention is an extremely important
aspect in monotonous and prolonged attention seeking tasks. Recently,
Event Related Potentials (ERPs) of Electroencephalograph (EEG) have
garnered great attention from the researchers for their application in the
task of vigilance assessment. However, till date the studies related to
ERPs and their association with vigilance are in their nascent stage, and
requires more rigorous research eﬀorts. In this paper, we use P200 and
N200 ERPs of EEG for studying vigilance. For this purpose, we perform
Mackworth’s clock test experiment with ten volunteers and measure their
accuracy. From the measured accuracy and recorded EEG signals, we
identify that amplitude of P200 and N200 ERPs is directly correlated
with accuracy and thereby to vigilance task. Thus, both P200 and N200
ERPs can be applied to detect vigilance (in real-time) of people involved
in continuous monitoring tasks.

Introduction

According to Mackworth, “Vigilance is deﬁned as a state of readiness to detect
and respond to small changes occurring at random time intervals in the environment” [1]. In other words, vigilance or sustained attention is an act of careful
observation of critical or rare events whose negligence may lead to catastrophe
[2]. In today’s world, where emphasis is laid on reducing risks and errors, and
mitigating the chances of accidents, it seems rational to assess the operator vigilance in real time to avoid human errors. Air traﬃc control, drowsiness detection
in drivers, inspection and quality control, automated navigation, military and
border surveillance, life-guarding, cyber operations, space exploration, etc., [3],
are some major domains where operators are involved in monotonous tasks for
prolonged intervals of time and remaining vigilant is an utmost requirement.

However, in [4,5], it has been pointed that sleep deprivation, work overload,
stress, time pressure, drowsiness and prolonged working hours are the major
factors that lead to low vigilance, thereby, human errors.
Till date several concerted eﬀorts have been made in the literature to propose
and design new techniques of vigilance detection with the help of features like,
heart rate variability [6], galvanic skin response [6], pupil diameter, eye blink
frequency [3] and brain activity measurement [7–9] (namely, EEG (Electroencephalogram), MEG (Magnetoencephalogram), fNIRS (functional near infrared
spectroscopy), ECoG (electrocorticogram), fMRI (functional magnetic resonance
imaging), etc.). Although, the techniques mentioned above are good contender
for vigilance detection, yet, they have several serious limitations associated with
them. For instance, eye related features show strong inter-personal and intrapersonal variability, EEG suﬀers from poor spatial resolution, MEG requires
special operating environment for its functioning, ECoG involves implantation
of electrodes in an invasive manner, fMRI is associated with high equipment
overhead and fNIRS suﬀers from low spatial resolution.
Amongst the above-mentioned methods, designed for vigilance detection,
EEG is the most commonly studied physiological measure despite of its poor
spatial resolution. The prime reasons behind its tremendous popularity amongst
researchers are: (1) its high time resolution, (2) its non-invasive nature and simplicity of operation and (3) relatively cheap cost compared to other devices. Furthermore, as vigilance deteriorates with time it seems plausible to study the brain
signals in time bound fashion to assess the vigilance status in real-time. In this
regard, the Event Related Potentials (ERPs) present in the EEG signals have successfully been utilized to study the changes occurring in the human brain with
passing time [10]. For instance, ERP features namely P100-N200 have been utilized for studying emotional information processing in [11]; frontal midline theta
and N200 ERP have been shown to reﬂect complementary information about
expectancy and outcome evaluation in [12]; in [13] authors utilized N200 ERP
for word recognition; in [14], N100, P200, N200 and P300 ERP components have
been used to study the impact of depression on attention. Further, ERPs have
also been used for understanding reaction times in response to pictures of people depicting pain [15]; in [16] ERPs have been utilized to understand the state
of brain in schizophrenia patients; in [17] authors demonstrated the association of
mMMN, P200 and P500 ERP components with artiﬁcial grammar learning in the
primate brain; in [18], N400 and the P200 components have been utilized in the
investigation of semantic and phonological processing in skilled and less-skilled
comprehenders; besides, ERPs have also found utility in studying multisensory
integration (MSI) ability of the brain in school-aged children [19].
From the above literature, we observe that P200 and N200 ERPs (see
Fig. 1) have been instrumental in studying cognitive behaviour of humans and
is prospective for real-time assessment of vigilance. Here, concisely P200 ERP
refers to a positive spike in EEG signals which is generally observed within 150
to 250 ms after the exhibition of a target stimulus (auditory or visual event) [20],
while N200 is a negative potential usually evoked between 180 to 325 ms after

204

S. Samima et al.

the presentation of a speciﬁc visual or auditory stimulus following a string of
standard (non-target) stimuli [21,22]. In general, P200 latency is a measure of
stimulus classiﬁcation speed and its amplitude represents the amount of attentional resources devoted to the task along with the required degree of information
processing, whereas N200 ERP, which is usually evoked only during conscious
stimulus attention before the motor response, is helpful in stimulus identiﬁcation
and distinction, thereby suggesting its link to the cognitive processes.

Fig. 1. P200 and N200 components in ERP signal of EEG data

In this work we propose (a) to use N200 and P200 ERPs for studying vigilance, (b) observe the correlation of N200 and P200 ERPs with behavioural
accuracy obtained, (c) observe the variation in the amplitude of both N200 and
P200 ERPs under the presence of target and non-target stimuli, (d) observe the
variation in the active areas of the brain before, during and after the experiment
and check whether the hotspots are present in the areas from which P200 and
N200 evoke.

Proposed Methodology

In the following, we present our proposed research methodology and steps for
extracting ERPs (P200 and N200) from the EEG signals.
2.1

Experimental Setup

Subjects: Ten healthy, right handed participants with normal or correctedto-normal vision, aged between 26 to 33 years volunteered for the experiment

Detecting Vigilance in People Performing Continual Monitoring Task

205

(see Table 1). To carefully monitor the vigilance of each volunteer, a proper
schedule was maintained. It was ensured that the participants: (a) were not sleep
deprived, (b) were under no medication and (c) had no history of mental illness.
We also took written consent from each participant, which was approved by
the institution’s ethical committee, before conducting the experiment. Further,
we asked each volunteer to do not consume tea or coﬀee 3 to 4 h prior to the
experiment. Keeping in mind the usual circadian cycle of activeness of each
participant, the experiment was conducted in the morning, that is between 7 am
and 10 am.

Vigilance Task: To study the variation of vigilance over a long period of
time, we utilized the computerized version of the M ackworth Clock T est as the
experimentation tool, wherein the small circular pointer moves in a circle like
the seconds’ hand of an analog clock. It changes its position approximately after
one second. However, at infrequent and irregular intervals, the pointer can make
a double jump. Here, the task of each participant is to detect and respond to
the double jump of the pointer, indicating the presence of the target event, by
pressing the space bar key of the keyboard.
2.2

Protocol

The participants were comfortably seated in a quiet and isolated room (devoid
of any Wi-Fi connections), wherein a constant room temperature was also maintained. Before conducting the actual experiment, each participant was given
proper demonstrations and instructions about the experiment and were asked
to relax for ten minutes. Further, a practice session of ﬁve minutes was also
arranged for each participant to make them accustomed to the task. We utilized
a large 20 in. monitor kept at a distance of 65 cm from the user for presenting the
visual stimuli to the participant. The beginning of the experiment was marked
by an EEG recording of an idle session of ﬁve minutes followed by the clock
test of 20 min. There were a total of 1200 trials in the experiment. After completion of the clock test, we again recorded the EEG signals for an idle session
of ﬁve minutes. Besides, to keep track of a participant’s responses and to ensure
true marking of the target events, we also recorded the hardware interrupt from
the keyboard. The entire experimental procedure has been pictorially shown in
Fig. 2.

Data Acquisition

The experiment was designed to be completed in 30 min. Further, all EEG data
recordings were carried out with the help of portable, user friendly and cost
eﬀective Emotiv Epoc+ device which follows the well-known 10–20 international
system. This device comprises of 14 electrodes positioned at AF3, F7, F3, FC5,
T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8 and AF4 locations and has a sampling
rate of 128 Hz. We collected 12000 trials for our experiment with the help of ten
voluntary participants.
2.4

Detection of ERPs

1. Pre-processing: Usually while recording EEG data, due to various external
environmental disturbances, the data gets contaminated with various kinds
of artifacts. The extraction of desired/useful features from the EEG signal
becomes very diﬃcult under the presence of artifacts. Hence, to minimize the
eﬀect of artifacts, it is mandatory to pre-process the recorded raw EEG signals. For this purpose, ﬁlters in the standard frequency range of (0.1–30 Hz)
are used. Thus, ﬁlters help in extracting the desired brain activity by rejecting the other undesired brain signals within a frequency range of (<0.1 Hz
and >30 Hz). In the present work, we have used the Chebyshev’s high pass
ﬁlter (having cut oﬀ frequency of 0.1 Hz) to remove all disturbing components emerging from breathing and voltage changes in neuronal and nonneuronal artifacts. Besides, we used Chebyshev’s low pass ﬁlter (having cut
oﬀ frequency of 30 Hz) to eliminate the noise arising from muscle movements.
Further, to ensure perfect rejection of the strong 50 Hz power supply interference, impedance ﬂuctuation, cable defects, electrical noise, and unbalanced

Detecting Vigilance in People Performing Continual Monitoring Task

207

impedances of the electrodes, we utilized (at the recording time) a notch ﬁlter
with null frequency of 50 Hz.
2. Feature Extraction: It is known from the literature that P200 and N200 ERPs
are dominant over parietal, occipital and frontal regions, respectively, of the
brain. Thus to locate these features, we have used the AF3, AF4, F3, F4,
P7, P8, O1 and O2 electrodes. Now, for extracting the features from the
EEG signals, ﬁrst, the pre-processed EEG data is marked to identify the
type of event (that is, correctly identiﬁed event, falsely identiﬁed event and
missed event). Next, baseline removal process is carried over this marked data,
followed by epoch averaging (500 ms pre-stimulus and 1000 ms post-stimulus)
to generate the ERP waveforms. Furthermore, to verify the presence of P200
and N200 ERPs we performed ensemble averaging of the target event epochs
and plotted the average waveform.

Results and Discussions

The recorded EEG data, of 20 min, has been divided into 10 equal observation
periods of two minutes each to carefully observe the pattern of vigilance changes.
Next, we observed the amplitude and latency variation of P200 and N200 component of ERPs for those instances where the user responded correctly to an
occurrence of the target event. Further, we compared the accuracy attained by
each individual, while focusing on the pointer of the clock test and trying to correctly detect the target, with the amplitude of P200 and N200 ERPs to establish
a correlation amongst them. The variation of amplitude and latency of P200 and
N200 has been reported in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. The amplitude ranges
for P200 and N200 ERP are heuristically deﬁned as follows:

To evaluate the performance of the participants in terms of accuracy of detection, we sub-divided the recorded EEG data into four categories deﬁned as true
alarm (T A), true skip (T S), false alarm (F A) and false skip (F S). In terms of
Mackworth Clock test experiment, true alarm represents correct identiﬁcation
of target stimuli, true skip represents correct identiﬁcation of non-target stimuli,

false alarm represents incorrect key pressed at non-targets and false skip represents non-identiﬁcation of the target stimuli. Based on these data, the accuracy
is calculated by using Eq. 3. The accuracy of detection of each individual who
participated in the experiment has been tabulated in Table 4. The latencies of
P200 and N200 ERPs were observed to be within the already known ranges;
however, no particular trend with respect to amplitude has been observed for
the obtained latencies.

From Tables 2, 3 and 4, and using Eqs. 1, 2 and 4, we can see that for participant P2, during an observation interval between (4–6) min the amplitude of
P200 is high (12.67 µV) while the amplitude of N200 is low (−3.04 µV), thereby
resulting in 93.48% accuracy. In case of participant P6, during an observation
interval between (16–18) min the amplitude of both P200 and N200 is low and is
2.31 µV and −1.25 µV, respectively, thereby resulting in 71.41% accuracy. In case
of participant P1, during an observation interval between (6–8) min the amplitude of P200 is low (1.71 µV) while the amplitude of N200 is high (−7.19 µV),

thereby resulting in 81.48% accuracy. Similarly, in case of participant P1, during
observation interval between (0–2) min the amplitude of both P200 and N200
is high and is 10.48 µV and −6.109 µV, respectively, thereby resulting in 100%
accuracy. Other values may be veriﬁed from the tables in the similar manner
to conclude that both accuracy and ERPs (P200 and N200) are correlated to
each other, such that, whenever the accuracy of detection is high there is a high
amplitude of P200 and N200. In other words, we can say that whenever an individual successfully distinguishes the target stimuli amongst all other presented
stimuli, the two ERPs, viz., N200 and P200 are elicited with high amplitude.
Besides, we also show the variation of accuracy and amplitude of P200 and N200
with time for participant P1 in Fig. 3. It can be easily observed from Fig. 3 that
accuracy of target detection and amplitude of both ERPs are correlated.

Fig. 3. Plot showing variation of accuracy and amplitude of P200 and N200 with time

To study the variations in the ERPs under the presence of true alarm (when
the user correctly identiﬁes the target events) and false alarm (when the user
incorrectly identiﬁes the events), we plotted the P200 and N200 ERPs on a single
graph with common origin (see Fig. 4). We observed that there is a considerable
diﬀerence in the amplitude of both ERPs under true and false alarm conditions.
Further, Fig. 5 shows the variation in P200 and N200 ERPs under the presence of target and non-target stimuli.
Figure 6 depicts the variation in the active regions of the brain before, during
and after the completion of the experiment. Here, blue spots visible in pre and
post experiment scalp images show low brain activity, while the red spots visible
during experimentation show an increase in the brain activity of the associated
regions. Besides, from instance 1 we observed that during the experiment - parietal, frontal and some parts of occipital region were highly energized and these
regions showed the presence of P200 and N200 ERPs. Further, from instance 2

we observed that during the experiment frontal region was highly energized and
the region showed the presence of N200 ERP. Through this, we veriﬁed that
our experiment successfully evokes the two ERPs from the designated regions.
Hence, we can apply the selected ERPs for vigilance detection.

Conclusion

In the literature diﬀerent features of EEG signals have been utilized to study
vigilance level of human beings. In this work, First, we successfully demonstrated
that both P200 and N200 ERPs are suitable candidates for studying vigilance.
Second, we observed the variation in P200 and N200 amplitude with true alarm
and false alarm. Third, we observed the variation in P200 and N200 amplitude
under the presence of target and non-target stimuli. Fourth, with the help of
scalp plot of Fig. 6 we veriﬁed the hot-spots/active regions of the brain from
where the studied ERPs originate.
This work may be applied in real-time analysis of vigilance. Besides, in future
we plan to extend this work to quantize the level of vigilance instead of indicating
its mere presence and absence.
