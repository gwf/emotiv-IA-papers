ABSTRACT
Background Researchers in environmental psychology,
health studies and urban design are interested in the
relationship between the environment, behaviour settings
and emotions. In particular, happiness, or the presence
of positive emotional mindsets, broadens an individual’s
thought-action repertoire with positive beneﬁts to
physical and intellectual activities, and to social and
psychological resources. This occurs through play,
exploration or similar activities. In addition, a body of
restorative literature focuses on the potential beneﬁts to
emotional recovery from stress offered by green space
and ‘soft fascination’. However, access to the cortical
correlates of emotional states of a person actively
engaged within an environment has not been possible
until recently. This study investigates the use of mobile
electroencephalography (EEG) as a method to record and
analyse the emotional experience of a group of walkers
in three types of urban environment including a green
space setting.
Methods Using Emotiv EPOC, a low-cost mobile EEG
recorder, participants took part in a 25 min walk
through three different areas of Edinburgh. The areas
(of approximately equal length) were labelled zone 1
(urban shopping street), zone 2 ( path through green
space) and zone 3 (street in a busy commercial district).
The equipment provided continuous recordings from
ﬁve channels, labelled excitement (short-term),
frustration, engagement, long-term excitement
(or arousal) and meditation.
Results A new form of high-dimensional correlated
component logistic regression analysis showed evidence
of lower frustration, engagement and arousal, and
higher meditation when moving into the green space
zone; and higher engagement when moving out of it.
Conclusions Systematic differences in EEG recordings
were found between three urban areas in line with
restoration theory. This has implications for promoting
urban green space as a mood-enhancing environment
for walking or for other forms of physical or
reﬂective activity.

Within environmental psychology, positive emotional
mindsets1 and speciﬁcally restorative theory2 3 have
proposed that natural settings promote recovery from
stress and fatigue via attention restoration mechanisms. Soft fascination (intriguing environmental
stimuli) promotes involuntary attention, enabling cognitive recovery from fatigue, and is typically present
in natural settings. By contrast, hard fascination
(demanding stimulation) grabs attention dramatically,
increasing cognitive load, and is typically present in
urban settings. The recovery from stress has been
assessed in many different ways, including positive

effects on heart rate,3 perceived stress4 5 and salivary
cortisol.6
Brain studies are increasingly relevant as the
development of affective computing7 and brain–
computer interfaces (BCI) enable researchers and
designers to measure brain activity in environmental settings.8 Although functional brain imaging
has been used for subjects viewing environmental
scenes in a laboratory setting,9 no ﬁeld data are
available to our knowledge.

AIMS
Our study was aimed at exploring ways of using
electroencephalography (EEG) technology in the
assessment of urban experience.
There are two research questions.
1. Can the emotional impact of different urban
environments be detected by cortical EEG
signals while participants are walking through
them?
2. Is there any evidence that urban green space
can modify EEG signals in a restorative way,
that is, reduction of stress, arousal and frustration and increase in meditation?

METHODS
Equipment
The Emotiv EPOC wireless EEG headset and accompanying software10 was used for our research. EPOC
consists of 14 sensors positioned on the wearer’s
scalp according to the international 10–20 system:
antero-frontal (AF3, AF4, F3, F4, F7, F8), frontocentral (FC5, FC6), occipital (O1, O2), parietal (P7,
P8) and temporal sites (T7, T8). Brain waves are measured in terms of amplitude (10–100 microvolts) and
frequency (1–80 Hz). The four main independent
bands are: δ (0.5–4 Hz), indicating deep sleep, restfulness, and conversely excitement or agitation when
delta waves are suppressed; θ (4–8 Hz), indicating
deep meditative states, daydreaming and automatic
tasks; α (8–15 Hz), indicating relaxed alertness,
restful and meditative states; β (15–30 Hz), indicating
wakefulness, alertness, mental engagement and conscious processing of information. EPOC also includes
a two-axis gyroscope to detect the wearer’s head
motion and orientation.
Emotiv EPOC is a novel, commercial device
shifting from the medical EEG paradigm to affordable devices for commercial BCI use. Typical
output from the device is shown in ﬁgure 1.
We do not have direct access to the manufacturer’s
algorithm relating to emotional parameters to raw
EEG output on intellectual property rights (IPR)
grounds. However, a number of studies have conﬁrmed the reliability and validity of Emotiv’s EEG performance10 11 and the detection of emotional states.12

Short report

Figure 1 (A) Neural cap; (B) output from the Emotiv Testbench software: Emotiv EPOC records electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 14
sensor positions according to the 10–20 International System. Raw EEG signals are then ‘translated’ and classiﬁed in different emotional states and
(C) output from the Emotiv Control Panel and ‘Affectiv suite’ (EEG data belong to the authors).
First, the EPOC EEG headset during feasibility trials10 has
been validated against a medical grade headset. The voltage and
time resolution were found to be lower and the noise ﬂoor
higher with the EPOC, but overall, the spectra and signals were
regarded as well matched to a respected medical grade device.
The ampliﬁer linearity and channel phase differences were
reported to be ‘as good as any medical grade device—the resolution is limited only by the lower bit count and sampling rate’.
Second, the validation of the headset has also been conﬁrmed
by a recent paper using the Emotiv mobile headgear in the
Journal of Psychophysiology.11 The paper concludes ‘that good
quality, single-trial EEG data suitable for mobile BCI can be
obtained with affordable hardware’.
Our experiment involved a light, high-performing laptop with
solid state storage, wireless EEG and a global positioning system
(GPS) unit as shown in ﬁgure 2. For our experiments, we used
Emotiv’s ‘Affectiv suite’, which employs proprietary algorithms for
ﬁltering and translating combinations of EEG signals to four variables indicating emotional states, namely: excitement (long-term
and short-term), frustration, engagement and meditation. We developed a custom-software platform to geoannotate emotional states
from Emotiv’s Affectiv suite in the conduct of our outdoor studies.

Participants
Twelve students from Edinburgh University were recruited to
participate, and ethical scrutiny and approval for the study were

provided by the School Ethics Committee. The mean age of the
study participants was 30.08 with eight males, and four females.

The walk
The route was the same for all participants and it was selected
to include three distinct zones in the centre of Edinburgh, of
approximately equal length. These were zone 1 (urban shopping
street with many people, 19th century buildings, light trafﬁc);
zone 2 ( path through 26 ha green space, bordering lawns,
playing ﬁelds with trees; and zone 3 (busy commercial district
with heavy trafﬁc, many pedestrians, high-noise levels).
Photographs of the three zones are shown in ﬁgure 3A–C.
All of the 12 participating walkers travelled individually
through the zones in the same sequence—zones 1, 2 and 3. The
walkers were instructed to progress at their own pace and knew
they were being observed by the researcher, who followed at a
distance of 10–30 m.
All the walkers, except one, completed the walk within
24–26 min (mean 26.25 min, max 38.0 min). This generated
around 48 000 lines of data (ie, around 4000 lines for each
walker) across the ﬁve Emotiv channels. To reduce the volume
of data, a 20% random sample was taken across all zones subsequent logistic regression analysis. This enabled two separate
logistic regressions to be run with green space the common
element. The consequence of this sampling resulted in

Analysis

RESULTS

As traditional methods of regression are unsuitable for the
form of data collected, which includes multiple records per
case, a note is needed on the novel analysis used. We used a
form of high dimensional correlated component regression
analysis with M-fold cross-validation, which has a number of
beneﬁts in addition to its capacity to deal with multiple
records and multicollinearity.13 14 First, the usually recommended limits on the number of cases per predictor are
relaxed to the extent that ( p), the number or predictors,
can exceed (n), the number of cases—hence, its deﬁnition as
high dimensional. Second, the method’s use of regularisation

At a descriptive level, a map of the route and a typical EEG
record from one participant are shown in ﬁgure 4A,B. The
chart at the top of ﬁgure 4B shows the emotional levels from
excitement (1) and frustration (2) while graph (3) shows longterm (LT) excitement levels that have been smoothed by
Emotiv’s software.
A record of the ﬂuctuations in excitement and frustration
is plotted as a map according to their geographical locale in
ﬁgure 4B below. For example, this participant remains excited
through zones 1 and 2, which are full of social interaction,
whereas excitement falls in zone 3. Conversely, frustration

seems to be highest at the start of the walk and lowest at the
end. An aggregate visualisation of the excitement levels of three
participants (ﬁgure 4C—peaks are in red, blue and yellow,
respectively) reveals shared patterns of emotional activity, even
though the experiment was performed on different days.

Comparison of zone 1 (urban shopping street)
and zone 2 (green space)
The output from correlated component logistic regression analysis is shown in table 1.
At the top of table 1 under ‘Fit’ is the value of R2 from crossvalidation together with its SE. Other rows of the table show
the area under the curve and accuracy of the model prediction.
Note that crossvalidation on out of sample prediction is close to
the training value. The effect size from R squared is 0.058,
which is at a small to medium level.15
Below ‘Fit’ is a table listing the usual regression output of
standardised coefﬁcients for each of the predictors. Table 1
shows that the rank order of standardised coefﬁcients is engagement (ie, alertness), followed by frustration, meditation and LT
excitement (or longer duration arousal). The negative sign indicates that the ﬁrst zone is higher on the emotional measure than
the second. In other words, in moving from zones 1 to 2 (from
urban street to green space), the ﬁrst three predictors in the
table (ie, frustration, engagement or alertness and LT excitement)
became lower, whereas meditation became higher.
To the right of the standardised coefﬁcients of predictors are
three columns of the correlated components (CC1, CC2 and
CC3) showing the loading of each standardised coefﬁcient
across the components. The weighting of each component is
given directly above it (eg, 1.2415, 0.3264 and 0.0742). In conventional regression, the number of components K is equal to
4

the number of predictors p (ie, K=p=4 in this case). However,
regularisation, which maximises R2 while improving out of
sample prediction, produces a three component solution. The
graph in ﬁgure 5A is based on this three component solution
and shows the red or darker line to be maximum for R squared
at four predictors.
Finally, at the bottom of table 1, the predictor table gives the
output of sample prediction across 100 regression runs (10
rounds each with 10 folds) within this case of four predictors
present in all 100 regression runs.

Comparison of zone 2 (green space) and zone 3
(busy commercial district)
The results for this correlated component logistic regression are
shown in table 2.
In the ‘ﬁt’ table, the R squared value under crossvalidation is
now 0.0203, which is considered small.15 The standard coefﬁcient table shows that there is just one predictor, which is
engagement, and only one correlated component, CC1. This is
conﬁrmed by the graph in ﬁgure 5B in which the red or darker
line for one component is maximum for R squared at one predictor. In this case, the sign of the predictor is positive, indicating that engagement or alertness is higher in zone 3, the busy
commercial district.
Finally, the predictor table 2 shows that for out of sample predictions across 100 regressions (10 rounds each with 10-folds),
one predictor (engagement) is present across all regression runs.

emotional changes as people walk through an urban

Short report
for all walkers. It is interesting to note that the transition from
zone 1 to zone 2 (urban shopping street to green space) is in
line with restorative theory with reductions in arousal, frustration, and engagement (ie, directed attention), and an increase in
meditation. This change involves a greater range and subtlety of
emotional response than the converse move from green space
to busy commercial district (ie, heavy trafﬁc/many people) in
which one dimension of emotional change (engagement or
alertness with directed attention) dominates.
In considering the limitations of the study, it would have been
beneﬁcial to have had access to the raw EEG measures, but this
was not possible for the reasons given above. We also noticed
that occasionally the EPOC was not streaming data, so we had
to repeat the experiment or have a partial data set. In addition,
owing to the ambulatory nature of the experiment, the trials
produced data of varying quality with minor electrode displacements of the EPOC headset owing to the gait occasionally
affecting the emotion detection algorithm.
Nonetheless, our ﬁndings are consistent with restorative
theory and encourage the use of the technology to extend
current research by developing novel and objective cortical correlates of emotion. This would be particularly beneﬁcial in
exploring the health improving potential of environments while
people are on the move.
