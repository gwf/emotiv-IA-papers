Abstract
Combining low-cost wireless EEG sensors with smartphones offers novel opportunities for mobile brain imaging in an
everyday context. Here we present the technical details and validation of a framework for building multi-platform, portable
EEG applications with real-time 3D source reconstruction. The system – Smartphone Brain Scanner – combines an off-theshelf neuroheadset or EEG cap with a smartphone or tablet, and as such represents the first fully portable system for realtime 3D EEG imaging. We discuss the benefits and challenges, including technical limitations as well as details of real-time
reconstruction of 3D images of brain activity. We present examples of brain activity captured in a simple experiment
involving imagined finger tapping, which shows that the acquired signal in a relevant brain region is similar to that obtained
with standard EEG lab equipment. Although the quality of the signal in a mobile solution using an off-the-shelf consumer
neuroheadset is lower than the signal obtained using high-density standard EEG equipment, we propose mobile application
development may offset the disadvantages and provide completely new opportunities for neuroimaging in natural settings.

variability of brain-wave frequency components in a mobile
scenario may be translated into neural signatures, e.g., reflecting
whether a user is on the phone while driving a car [10]. Similarly,
positioning the single EEG electrode headband over the temple
may provide the foundation for building a Brain-Computer
Interface (BCI) utilizing the ability to capture steady-state visualevoked potentials (SSVEP) from the visual cortex when looking at
flashing lights patterns, and thereby design a BCI interface for
prediction with high accuracy and no previous training when a
disabled user is focusing on a specific area of a screen, based on the
time-locked EEG traces automatically generated as multiples of
the particular flashing light frequencies [11].

consumer products, the ThinkGear module manufactured by

aspx) integrates a single dry electrode (reference and ground)
attached to a headband. Essentially a system on a chip, it provides
A/D conversion and amplification of one EEG channel, capable
of capturing brain-wave patterns in the 3–100 Hz frequency
range, recorded at 512 Hz sampling rate. Consumer neuroheadsets, such as those manufactured by Emotiv (http://www.emotiv.
com) provide low-density neuroimaging based on 16 electrodes
and typically support real-time signal processing in order to
complement standard EEG measures with aggregate signals,
which provide additional information on changes in mental state,
or facilitate control of peripheral devices related to games. Their
portability and built-in wireless transmission makes them suitable
for the development of fully mobile systems, allowing for running
EEG experiments in natural settings. The improved comfort of

Introduction
In the last few years, the research communities studying human
behavior have gained access to unprecedented computational and
sensing power that basically ‘‘fits into a pocket’’. This has
happened for both specialized equipment used for building
research tools, such as Reality Mining Badges [1] or accelerometer
sensors [2], and for consumer-grade, off-the-shelf devices.
Smartphones and tablets are capable of sensing, processing,
transmitting, and presenting information. This has already had a
significant impact on many research domains, such as social
science [3], computer-human interaction [4], and mobile sensing
[5,6]. In neuroscience there is a widely recognized need for
mobility, i.e., for devices that support quantitative measurements
in natural settings [7–9]. Here we present our work on the
Smartphone Brain Scanner, investigate the feasibility of off-the-shelf,
consumer-grade equipment in a neuroscience context, and build a
mobile real-time platform for stimulus delivery, data acquisition,
and processing with a focus on real-time imaging of brain activity.
Consumer-grade neuroheadsets, capable of recording brain
activity generated by post-synaptic potentials of firing neurons,
captured through electrodes placed on the scalp using Electroencepahlography (EEG), have only recently made mobile brain
monitoring feasible. Seen from a mental state decoding perspective, even a single channel EEG recording measuring the changes
in electrical potentials (based on a passive dry electrode positioned
at the forehead and a reference typically placed on the earlobe),
allows for measuring mental concentration and drowsiness by
assessing the relative distribution of frequencies in brain-wave
patterns throughout the day. Simply measuring the dynamic

sophisticated smartphone sensor system for cognitive monitoring
in natural conditions. We therefore briefly review the state of the
art in both domains.
Neuroimaging. Several software packages for offline and
online analysis of biomedical and EEG signals are available. The
most popular packages for off-line analysis are EEGLAB and
FieldTrip; for building real-time BCI-oriented applications,
notable frameworks are BCILAB, OpenViBE, and BCI2000.
EEGLAB is a toolbox for the MATLAB environment and is
useful for processing collections of single-trial or averaged EEG
data [20]. Functions available in this framework include data
importing, preprocessing (artifact rejection, filtering), independent
component analysis (ICA), and others. The framework can be used
via a graphical interface or by directly manipulating MATLAB
functions. The toolbox is available as an open source (GNU
license) and can be extended to incorporate various EEG data
formats coming from different hardware. Similarly, FieldTrip is an
open source (GNU License) MATLAB toolbox for the analysis of
MEG, EEG, and other electrophysiological data [21]. Among
others, FieldTrip has pioneered high-quality source reconstruction
methods for EEG imaging. FieldTrip has support for real-time
processing of data based on a buffer construction that allows
chunking of data for further processing in the MATLAB
environment.
BCILAB is a toolbox for building online Brain-Computer
Interface (BCI) models from available data [22]. It is a plugin for
EEGLAB running in MATLAB, providing functionalities for
designing, learning, use, and evaluation of real-time predictive
models. BCILAB is focused on operating in real-time for detecting
and classifying cognitive states. The classifier output from BCILAB
can be streamed to a real-time application to effect stimulus or
prosthetic control, or may be derived post-hoc from recorded data.
The framework is extensible in various layers; additional EEG
hardware as well as data processing steps (e.g., filters and
classifiers) can be added. But as these toolboxes are developed
within the MATLAB environment, neither FieldTrip’s real-time
buffer nor BCILAB are suitable for mobile application development.
OpenViBE is a software framework for designing, testing, and
using Brain-Computer Interfaces [23]. The main application fields
of OpenViBE are medical i.e., assistive technologies, bio- and
neurofeedback as well as virtual reality multimedia applications.
OpenViBE is an open source (LGPL 2.1) and targets an audience
focused on building real-time applications for Windows and Linux
Operating Systems, and does not specifically support light-weight
mobile platforms. A similar C++ based framework for building
real-time BCI applications is BCI2000 [24]. A comprehensive
review of the BCI frameworks can be found in [25]. Some of the
consumer EEG systems also include Software Development Kits
(SDKs), allowing for data acquisition, processing, and building
applications. Emotiv SDK, available with the Research Edition of
the Emotiv system is multi-platform, currently running on Linux,
OSX, and Windows. The SDK allows for building applications,
either using raw EEG data or extracted features, including
affective state and recognition of facial expressions based on eye
movements. The extracted features can be integrated into a C++
or C# application through a set of dynamically linked libraries.
Although such SDK frameworks can greatly speed up the process
of building BCI applications, they are mostly targeted towards
scenarios where immediate feedback is available, such as gaming,
and it remains a challenge to validate or tweak code for custom
needs. To sum up, none of the aforementioned software platforms
can easily be adapted to support mobile and embedded devices.

these mobile solutions also allows for extending neuroimaging
experiments over several hours. Furthermore, the relatively low
cost of the neuroheadsets and mobile devices potentially opens
new opportunities for conducting novel types of social neuroscience experiments, where multiple subjects are monitored while
they interact [12,13].
However, such ‘low-fi’ mobile systems present a number of
challenges. In real-time applications requiring signal processing to
be performed with the lowest possible delay in order to present
feedback to the user, the limited computational power of mobile
devices may be a constraint. A solution might be to offload parts of
the processing to an external server and retrieve the processed
results over the network. This approach, however, requires
network connection, possibly with low and constant delays, as
well as more complicated client-server architecture. Also in terms
of battery life, the local computation is more power-efficient than
continuous transmission to the server and back. Consumer-grade
mobile devices also present technical challenges for writing highquality software; the devices operate on systems that are not realtime (RTOS), as they do not guarantee certain delays in data
processing, and as such are ill-suited for time-sensitive tasks. These
limitations might also affect timing of visual or auditory stimuli
presentation, as well as synchronization with other sensors. From a
neuroscience perspective, low-resolution recordings and artifacts
induced in a mobile setup both present significant challenges.
Noise and confounds are introduced by movement of the subject
and electrical discharges, while the positioning of the electrodes
might be less than ideal when compared to a standard laboratory
EEG setup [14–17]. Nevertheless, we hold that these drawbacks
are clearly offset by the advantages of being able to conduct studies
incorporating larger groups of subjects over extended periods of
time in more natural settings. We suggest that mobile EEG systems
can be considered from two viewpoints: as stand-alone portable
low-fi neuroimaging solutions, or as an add-on for retrieving
neuroimaging data under natural conditions complementary to
standard neuroimaging lab environments.
In terms of software programming, creating a framework for
applications in C++ rather than in prevalent environments such as
MATLAB, while approaching the problem as a smartphone
sensing challenge, might enable new types of contributions to
neuroscience. The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community is already starting to apply consumer-grade headsets to extend
existing paradigms [18], thus incorporating neuroscience as a
means to enhance data processing. Similarly, the availability of
low-cost equipment means even general ‘hacker-and-tinkerers’
audiences will almost certainly gain interest in using neuroscience
tools (http://neurogadget.com). We see a great value in the
emerging potential of entirely new groups of researchers and
developers becoming interested in neuroscience and obtaining
tools allowing them to develop new kinds of applications.
In a previous communication [19], we discussed opportunities
and challenges in mobile and portable EEG. Here we address the
foundations of the Smartphone Brain Scanner system, focusing on
engineering and technical aspects of both software and hardware
components. We describe the computational architecture of the
framework, and discuss timing, reliability, and quality of the
obtained signal. In particular we report on the results of a
validation experiment comparing the system with a conventional
EEG acquisition system in a prototypical application.

and low-cost) mobile neurosystems (see Figure 1). The SBS2 is
freely available under the MIT License on GitHub at
https://github.com/SmartphoneBrainScanner. The repositories
contain the core of the framework, as well as example applications.
The documentation hosted on GitHub wiki pages (https://github.
com/SmartphoneBrainScanner/smartphonebrainscanner2-core/
wiki) includes instructions for compiling the software, building the
hardware components, preparing the devices, and writing custom
applications. An active mailing list for developers also exists at https://
groups.google.com/forum/#forum/smartphonebrainscanner2-dev
The SBS2 framework is divided into three layers: low-level data
acquisition, data processing, and applications. The first two layers
constitute the core of the system and include common elements
used by various applications. An overview of the architecture is
shown in Figure 2.

There exist various repositories of openly available human EEG
data [26,27]. Such datasets contain both recordings from highdensity and low-density systems and are an important tool for
advancing the field. We feel that the increased availability of EEG
systems will result in even more publicly available data. Although
very beneficial for the field, this will undoubtedly raise concerns
about the privacy of the subjects, whose very sensitive data in the
form of EEG recordings, will possibly exist indefinitely.
Cognitive monitoring systems. Mobile brain imaging
might also be viewed as yet another sensor extension to selftracking applications, which have become prevalent with smartphones and the emergence of low-cost wearable devices - lowering
the barriers for people to engage in life logging activities [28]. With
the availability of multiple embedded sensors, modern smartphones
have become a platform for out-of-the-box data acquisition of
mobility (GPS, cellular network, WiFI), activity level (accelerometer), social interaction (Bluetooth, call, and text logs), and
environmental context (microphone, camera, light sensor) [3].
Recently, non-invasive recording of brain activity has become
common as several low-cost commercial EEG neuro-headset and
headband systems have been made available, including the
previously mentioned Emotiv EPOC and NeuroSky, the InteraXon
Muse (http://www.interaxon.ca/), Axio (http://www.axioinc.com/),
and Zeo (http://myzeo.com/). These sensors support applications
ranging from BCI, game control, stress reduction, and cognitive
training, to sleep monitoring. These neuroheadsets feature up to 16
electrodes, but ongoing developments promise next-generation lowcost EEG devices with a significantly higher number of electrodes,
better quality signals, and improved comfort. The Smartphone Brain
Scanner framework described in this paper can be used with mobile
EEG devices with various numbers of electrodes to allow for capture
of neuroimaging data over several hours. Battery tests on Samsung
Galaxy Note with all wireless radios and screen turned off resulted in
11 hours of uninterrupted recording and storage of data from an
Emotiv EPOC headset. However, current generation neuroheadsets
are limited by their solution-based electrodes, which dry out. More
comfortable designs [29,30] may be required for continuous mobile
neuroimaging throughout the day.
Beyond EEG, multiple bio signals and physiological parameters
can contribute to cognitive state monitoring, such as respiratory
rate [31], heart rate variability, galvanic skin response [32], blood
pressure, oxygen saturation, body/skin temperature, ECG, EMG,
and body movements [33]. A webcam or a camera embedded in a
smartphone can allow measurements of heart rate, variability, and
respiratory rate by analyzing the color channels in the video signal
[34]. Continuous monitoring of heart rate is enabled by pulse
watches (http://www.polar.com/) and recently by the Basis Band
wrist-worn sensor (http://www.mybasis.com), which allows 24/7
recording under a subset of conditions (non-workout situations).
Both continuous heart rate monitoring solutions allow user
mobility and measurements in natural conditions. The Q Sensor
from Affectiva (http://www.affectiva.com/) is an example of a
system for monitoring galvanic skin response (GSR) and
accelerometer and temperature data from a wrist-worn device.
FitBit (http://www.fitbit.com/) is an example of a wearable
pedometer, monitoring number of steps taken, distance traveled,
calories burned, and floors climbed.

Key features. With a focus on the mobile devices, SBS2 is a
multi-platform framework. The underlying technology – Qt – is an
extension of C++ and is currently supported on the main desktop
operating systems (Linux, OSX, Windows) as well as on mobile
devices (Android, BB10, and partially iOS, see http://qt.digia.
com/Product/Supported-Platforms/).
We have aimed for a modular framework, allowing for adding
and modifying data acquisition and processing blocks. The
modules are created as C++ classes and integrate directly with
the core of the framework. The framework supports building realtime applications; data can be recorded for subsequent off-line
analysis. However, most of the implemented data-processing
blocks aim to provide real-time functionality for working with the
EEG signal. The applications developed with SBS2 can be
installed on both desktop and mobile devices; installation can be
started by the user and distributed via regular channels, such as
repositories and application stores.
Data acquisition. The Data Acquisition layer is responsible
for setting up communication with an EEG device, acquiring the
raw data, and forming packets. Three primary objects are used:
Sbs2Mounter, Sbs2DataReader, and Sbs2Packet, thereby abstracting all the specificities of the EEG systems (hardware) and of
the OS+ device running the software (platform). Different
embedded devices, even with the same OS, may require a specific
code for certain low-level functionalities, for example to access the
USB port. A higher-fidelity architecture is shown in Figure 3. The
EEG hardware is set up by a specialized Sbs2Mounter object. The
information about the hardware (e.g. mounting point, serial
number) is passed to a Sbs2DataReader object. This object
subsequently begins reading the raw data from the hardware. The
raw data are passed to a Sbs2Packet object to create a proper
encapsulation, setting the values for all the EEG channels and
metadata. Once formed, the packet is pushed to the Data
Processing layer via a Sbs2Callback object.
The Data Acquisition layer of the SBS2 was originally designed
to support the Emotiv EEG headset. It has been extended to
support additional hardware, such as custom made EasyCap
hardware, by implementing additional classes of the hardware
mounter, data reader, and packet creator. For Emotiv headset, this
layer also contains the data decryption module, as the stream
coming from the device is encrypted.
Mounting the EEG hardware on a desktop and embedded
devices requires drivers, either standard kernel modules or
proprietary drivers created by the vendor. The Emotiv EPOC
USB receiver is mounted as/dev/hidraw in Linux (desktop and
Android), provided the device and the kernel support the USB
host mode and have the HIDRAW module enabled. Most desktop

to support them by default. This will likely have a significant
impact on the adoption of neuroimaging outside lab environments.
Data processing. Well-formed EEG packet objects are used
for data processing. The functionality of this layer is hardwareagnostic and depends only on packet content, i.e. data for the EEG
channels, reflecting a particular sensor configuration, and sampling frequency. Single packets are dispatched to different
processing objects and methods, including recording, filtering,
3D reconstruction, etc. Some operations need to collect data into
frames and run asynchronously (in separate thread), pushing the
results back to the callback object once the results are ready.
Sbs2Callback is an object implementing the getData(Sbs2Packet*) method, to which single packets are always passed
and can then be dispatched to the Sbs2DataHandler or pushed to
the Application layer. Sbs2DataHandler is an object providing
methods for data processing, by delegating them to specialized
objects, including Sbs2FileHandler and Sbs2Filter.
The framework for data processing is extensible and new
modules can be added to the core; the data handler prepares the
data in a format expected by the processing block (e.g. collecting
packets into larger frames) and runs the processing method. The
currently implemented blocks allow for a variety of processing
operations. The raw EEG data can be recorded, including timestamped events (stimuli onsets, user responses, etc.). Raw packets,
as well as extracted features and arbitrary values, can be streamed
over the network for either data processing or interconnection
between devices (multiplayer gaming is one example). Other
methods for data processing, including filter, FFT, spatial filter
(CSP), and classifier (LDA), are also implemented and can be used
for building the pipelines.

Linux flavors have both by default, but currently most Android
mobile devices only support the USB host mode out-of-the-box. In
the current implementation, a custom kernel needs to be compiled
with the HIDRAW module enabled. Reading the data directly
from the /dev/hidraw device requires ‘root’ privileges, which must
be enabled on Android devices to acquire data from the Emotiv
EPOC receiver. This is possible for most recent Android devices,
e.g. for the Nexus (developer) line of devices. We can expect that
the next generation of mobile neuroheadsets will use standardized
Bluetooth low-energy protocols and Android devices will be able

scalp level. As the number of possible source locations far exceeds
the number of channels, this is known to be an extremely ill-posed
inverse problem. A unique solution is obtained by imposing prior
information in correspondence with anatomical, physiological, or
mathematical properties [35–37]. Implemented inverse methods
in the SBS2 cover Bayesian formulations of the widely used
Minimum-norm method (MN) [37] and low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) [38]. The Bayesian formulation
used in the SBS2 framework allows adaptation of hyperparameters to different noise environments in real-time. This is
an improvement over previous real-time source reconstruction
approaches [39–41] that applied heuristics to estimate the
parameters involved in the inverse method. The current source
reconstruction is based on an assumed forward model matrix, A,
connecting scalp sensor signals Y (channel by time) and current
sources S (cortical locations by time) [42]

the noise variance. Using Bayes’ rule, the posterior distribution
over the sources is maximized by

ð1Þ

Here, L denotes a spatial coherence matrix, which in the current
form takes advantage of the graph Laplacian using a fixed
smoothness parameter (0:2).
Handling noise estimation is a crucial part for acquiring reliable
source estimates. We have previously examined how eye-related
artifacts can corrupt the source estimates for low density EEG caps
with unevenly distributed sensors such as the Emotiv EPOC [19].
While we here have adopted the assumption of the noise to be
uncorrelated, correlated noise can easily be included in the model
above, either directly in the model or indirectly through preprocessing the data prior to the source modeling. Direct modeling
of the correlated noise can be achieved by replacing the identity
matrix INc with a full noise covariance matrix SE . Estimation of
the noise covariance matrix could e.g. be carried out through
calibration sessions. By online estimating the hyperparameter b
the inverse solver continuously can model the amount of noise
present in the data.
The present data analytic pipeline does not include real-time
artifact reduction steps, hence cleaning of data for eye, muscle, or
motion induced artifacts must be carried out post hoc in the

The term E accounts for noise not modeled by the linear
generative model. When estimating the forward model a number
of issues are taken into consideration, such as sensor positions, the
geometry of the head model (spherical or ‘realistic’ geometry), and
tissue conductivity values [43–45]. With the forward model A
given and the linear relation in Eq. (1), the source generators can
be estimated. We assume the noise term to be normally

rate obtained from three randomly picked Emotiv devices
(10610 min measurements for each).
Data quality. The Emotiv hardware adds a modulo 129
counter (0{128) to every packet transmitted from the device. This
allows for data quality control (dropped packets) with the accuracy
of a modulo 129. It is possible to obtain long recordings (over one
hour) using this neuroheadset and SBS2. The battery in the
Emotiv hardware is rated at 12h of continuous operation; in
recording-only setup, a mobile device such as Galaxy Note (offline
mode, screen off, only decrypting and recording) lasts for around
10h. Provided good visibility between the Emotiv EEG neuroheadset transmitter (located in the back part of the headset) and
the USB receiver was maintained, we were able to achieve zero
packet loss in the full rundown recording. In order to acquire an
EEG signal of good quality, the impedance between the electrodes
and the scalp should be kept under 5kV. The Emotiv headset
embeds the channel-quality information in the signal directly
(2 Hz per channel, multiplexed into the signal). The values are
unscaled, and come from applying a square wave of 128Hz to the
DRL feedback circuit and extracting the amplitude of the inherent
square wave using phase-locked detection on each channel. In
principle, the obtained values can be calibrated using a known
impedance. For regular usage, however, the hardware manufacturer assures the green color of the indicator (channel quality value
greater than 407) corresponds to sufficiently low impedance of the
electrode. From our experience with the system this appears
correct.
Timing. In order to measure the total delay in the system, we
used the setup as depicted in Figure 5. A sinusoidal audio tone of
10Hz, with its trailing and following periods of silence, was
generated and amplified so it could be detected by the EEG
hardware and also so it could be split into oscilloscope and EEG
hardware. The software on the device performed peak detection
on the signal and visualized the peaks by changing the screen color
from black to white. This change was detected by a photocell,
connected to the second channel of the oscilloscope. We can then
calculate dt1~t2{t1, indicating the total delay of the system from
the physical signal reaching the EEG hardware to being visualized
on the screen (without any additional processing), see Figure 6. We
also look at the jitter dt2 as the difference between min and max
values of dt1. The observed delta depends on the EEG sampling
rate (here 128Hz), the processing power of the device, and the
screen refresh rate (60Hz for all tested devices).

present system. Thus real-time imaging experiments, bio-feedback
etc. should be done under circumstances that reduce artifacts.

Methods: Experimental Designs
In this section we briefly describe the design of the experiments
demonstrating and validating the potential of the SBS2 framework, the specific hardware, and the mobile approach in general.

Timing and Data Quality
First, we analyzed the data and timing quality. Many
neuroscience paradigms rely heavily on accurate synchronization
between EEG signal and stimuli, user response, or data from other
sensors (e.g., P300, steady state visual evoked potentials). However,
we can also envision applications in which the present ‘low-cost’
mobile setup will be used to collect data from many subjects over
extended periods, where precise synchronization is less important.
Emotiv EEG sampling. The measurements are all based on
the Emotiv EEG neuroheadset. The nominal sampling frequency
of this neuroheadset is 128 Hz (down-sampled from internal

One of the most widely investigated paradigms in the BCI
literature is a task in which a subject is instructed to select between
two or more different imagined movements [19,46–49]. Such
experiments are rooted in a central aim of many BCI systems,

Figure 5. The timing measurement setup. 10 Hz sinusoid is generated with a computer sound card, amplified, and fed into an oscilloscope and
the EEG hardware. The device acquiring the EEG data responds to the sinusoid signal with changes of screen brightness, which is detected by a
photocell connected to the oscilloscope. The time difference between the two signals is used to calculate the system delay.

In this section we present and discuss the results of the
experiments, validating the performance of the software, the
platforms used, and the EEG hardware. These results aim to
validate the underlying framework with respect to key engineering
aspects and to outline the potential and limitations of the system,
especially from the user and developer perspective. More complex
experiments conducted using the system are described in [19].

can assume 128Hz, 127:88Hz, or measure the actual sampling
rate for every Emotiv EPOC hardware device individually.
Timing. The results of the timing measurements (20 per
device) are depicted in Figure 6.
We can see in the results for all devices that there is a significant
delay between the signal reaching the EEG hardware and being
fully processed in the software (80{125ms). This delay, although
significant, is fairly stable (16{26ms jitter) and thus can be
corrected for.
In the second set of measurements, we test the stability of the
timing of the packets as they appear in the system. To measure
this, we collect the packets from the Emotiv EPOC device and
change the screen color every 4 packets (limited by screen refresh
rate, 60Hz). This change is then measured by a photocell, fed into
the oscilloscope and the distance between the 4-packet packages is
calculated. Figure 8 shows these measurements.
In summary, the stability and quality of the acquired signal is
excellent. Most of the variations, including imperfect sampling rate
or timing jitters, are constant and can largely be accounted for in
the data analysis, if necessary.

classical experiment with imagined finger tapping (left vs. right)
inspired by [49]. The setup consisted of a set of three different
images with instructions: Relax, Left, Right. In order to minimize the
effect of eye movements, the subject was instructed to focus on the
center of the screen, where the instructions also appeared (3.5 inch
display size, 8006480 pixels resolution, at a distance of 0.5 m).
The instructions Left and Right appeared in random order. A total
of 200 trials were conducted for a single subject.

Emotiv EPOC hardware a) has an actual sampling rate close to
127:88Hz and b) keeps this sampling rate in a fairly consistent
manner. Depending on the analysis performed on the data, one

Imagined Finger Tapping – Online Source Reconstruction

Conclusions

In order to demonstrate the applicability of discriminating a
simple task such as the left and right imagined finger tapping on
the cortical source level in an online framework, the EEG data
were acquired with the Emotiv EPOC neuroheadset and
compared with EEG recordings acquired with a standard
laboratory setting, viz. using 64 channels on a Biosemi Active-II
device. The 64-channels were sub-sampled to represent the same
channel locations as the Emotiv device.
Imagined finger tapping is known to lead to a suppression of
alpha (8–13 Hz) activity over the premotor/motor regions, with
the contralateral areas normally being more desynchronized [51].
Thus, imagined right-finger tapping should lead to alpha activity
being suppressed in the left pre-motor region. In Figure 9, we show
the responses obtained with SBS2 and the standard equipment,
demonstrating the framework’s ability to reconstruct online
meaningful current sources within the given region. In particular,
Figure 9 shows how alpha power (8–13 Hz) is suppressed over
time in the region of interest - Precentral Left AAL (Automated
Anatomical Labeling). Both responses are calculated as the
averaged response over 87 and 79 responses to ‘right imaging’
cued trials that remained after rejecting trials with artifacts. Note
that, while the result is presented as an average over runs, the
source localization was carried out in online mode with model
parameters (a and b) and current sources (S) estimated online. We
note the similarity of the suppression of the alpha power in the Left
Precentral AAL region to imagined right-finger tapping trials as
obtained by the Emotiv EPOC and the Biosemi system. The
possible implications of using portable and low-cost systems such

We have presented the design, implementation, and evaluation
of the first fully portable 3D EEG imaging system: The Smartphone
Brain Scanner. The open source software allows real-time EEG data
acquisition and source imaging on standard off-the-shelf Android
mobile smartphones and tablets with a good spatial resolution and
frame rates in excess of 40 fps. In particular, we have implemented
a real-time solver for the ill-posed inverse problem with online
Bayesian optimization of hyper-parameters (noise level and
regularization).
The evaluation showed that the combined system provides for a
stable imaging pipeline with a delay of 80–120 ms. We showed
results of a cued, imagined finger-tapping experiment and
compared the smartphone brain scanner’s average power in the
alpha band in a relevant motor area with that of conventional
state-of-the-art laboratory equipment and found that these
aggregate signals compare favorably with those obtained with
standard equipment. Both show the expected de-synchronization
on initiation of imagined motor actions.
The work presented here is extended in [19], where we discuss
the perspectives and challenges of mobile and portable EEG
systems. That work also includes results from more complex
experiments, including neurofeedback applications and measuring
emotional responses.
Future developments in hardware and software will allow for
even better signal acquisition and analysis from low-density and
mobile setups. This includes electrodes of different type and form
(e.g. dry) and positioned in a non-standard way (e.g. inside ear

conventional and controlled, high-density laboratory equipment.

canal). From the software perspective, more computation power
available in the devices will allow for more powerful data
processing and de-noising algorithms to be run (e.g. PCA-based
or ICA-based artifacts rejection, more advanced 3D reconstruction), possibly using other available data sources (e.g. head
movements obtained from gyroscopes). The present data analytic
pipeline does not include real-time artifact reduction steps, hence
cleaning of data for eye-, muscle-, or motion-induced artifacts
must be carried out post hoc in the present system. Thus real-time
imaging experiments, bio-feedback etc. should be done under
circumstances that reduce artifacts.
We suggest the mobility and simplified application development
may enable completely new research directions for imaging
neuroscience and thus offset the expected reduced signal quality of
