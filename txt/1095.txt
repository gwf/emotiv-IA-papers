Abstract
Research on the application of augmented and virtual
reality (AVR) in education shows that students selfmotivation and performance increases as well as their
attractiveness to new ICT-enhanced classes. The aim of
this article is to explore the use of AVR as an engaging
learning tool for engineering education and to present a
framework for an AVR-lab for engineering education.
The AVR-lab will encourage teachers to adapt
classroom practices for state-of-the-art lectures that
integrate AVR educational technology. The graduates of
AVR-enhanced
curriculum
will
attain
new
competencies in AVR, which industry analysts
anticipate are vital for the 21st century labour market.

Introduction

To encourage interest of students and increase the
attractiveness of engineering as a field of study remains
a long-term challenge in the Norwegian education
system. This article argues that this challenge may be
remediated through the use of research-based learning
methods, (NationalResearchCouncil, 2012, Singer and
Smith, 2013, Nehm, 2014).
The augmented and virtual reality (AVR)-lab project
at Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied
Sciences originates from the idea of constructivistoriented pedagogy established in a technology-enabled
learning environment (TEAL) (Shieh, 2012). Scholars
have shown that technology-enhanced constructivist
pedagogy improves students’ non-test learning
outcomes - e.g., interest in classes, labs and
extracurricular science activities (Shieh, 2012).
Consequently, student achievement (performance,
higher learning outcomes) can provide motivation for
teachers to change traditional teaching practices
(structured lectures, note-taking) and teaching beliefs,
allowing for the integration of new technology - i.e.,
state-of-the-art lectures with integrated educational
technology.
The AVR-lab project aims to encourage teachers to
use new information and communication technology
(ICT) pedagogical tools in teaching and learning. This

article argues that several mechanisms including
communication and awareness, peer collaboration,
evidence of improved student performance, and support
from experts may help teachers to transform traditional
instruction methods (structured lectures, note-taking)
and adopt state-of-the-art lectures that integrate ICT.
This paper also relates to research on active learning
methods such as the Flipped Classroom (FC), including
methods to evaluate the study progress. Scholars have
reported significant performance increase for students
from the use of FC methods (Moravec et al., 2010, Day
and Foley, 2006).
In comparison with typical definitions of FC methods
(Bishop and Verleger, 2013), this article focuses on
interactive and augmented learning resources (eBooks,
exercises, games) instead of passive sources, such as
instructional videos (asynchronous video lectures).
The AVR-lab aims to promote the practical
application of active ICT-based pedagogy in teaching.
Hence this article is dedicated to promoting ICTenhanced cooperative learning using the FC, problembased learning and meta-learning. Models of problembased learning suggest that students gain topic-specific
knowledge and skills related to meta-learning by
engaging in activities that simulate “real-world”
contexts and challenges. Research refers to metalearning as an experiential process where students
internalize norms, values and practices related to
knowledge and skills acquisition (Rose et al., 2005).
In traditional approaches to learning, educational
institutions treat the student as an object in the teaching
process - i.e., the student is only a recipient of
knowledge and information without any active role
(Rose et al., 2005). Some scholars have argued that
meta-learning provides a basis for students’ to change
their identity from recipients to creators of knowledge
and understanding (Rose et al., 2005). As such, metalearning may promote “employability” by enhancing
self-efficacy and resilience among students. In the
context of the FC, the roles, identities and implicit
norms, values and expectations of students and teachers
may act to subvert the implementation of the FC
approach (Hagerup, 2017).
However, research has also shown that students
experience barriers to education in curriculum design,
teaching methods and learning resources (Coppola et al.,
2015, Nicholas et al., 2014, Boles and Whelan, 2016,
Litzinger et al., 2011).

According to (Rose et al., 2005) the Universal Design
for Learning (UDL) is a reference model that guides
educational practices, and aims to identify and remove
barriers in educational methods, curricula and teaching
materials. Taking a cue from research carried out on
brain activity and the adoption of education technology,
the UDL model provides the following guidelines:
• Representing the information in multiple formats
and on different media.
• Providing students with multiple paths.
• Promoting many possibilities for expression and
providing diversified ways to motivate students
and arouse their interest.
UDL also frames learning as a process that can be
designed to be accessible and inclusive for all students.
The three principles stated above are supported by ICT
to improve the learning process as follows:
• allow the manipulation and control of the learning
environment.
• offer multi-sensory alternatives for learning
materials.
• allow greater personal autonomy, especially for
students with disabilities, such as attention and
learning disabilities or sensory disabilities
• provide meaningful access to learning for all
students by enabling students to grasp abstract
concepts more fully.
This article argues that the combination of UDL and
new ICT technologies in education can enable and
empower students across the diversity of the human
experience.

Need for research

Research shows that there is a need for continuous
improvement in teaching, focusing on development of
feedback culture and the use of new educational
methods and tools (Deslauriers et al., 2011, Froyd et al.,
2012, Singer et al., 2012, Nicol, 2010).
Currently, the textbooks and digital textbooks
constitute the main source of learning materials
(Vasileva et al., 2016, Hilton, 2016, Fan et al., 2013,
Beetham and Sharpe, 2013). Nonetheless, research
shows that students provided with only textbooks are
less prepared for class than students provided with
optional video lectures (de Grazia et al., 2012).
Furthermore, students do not generally complete
reading assignments (Sappington et al., 2002).
Textbooks are a passive source of information, in
particular abstract terms, relationships, concepts,
principles and processes, that lack multimedia
interactivity - i.e., animations, visualizations and active
simulations. Furthermore, feedback mechanisms, which
are essential for improving learning outcomes, are also
missing.

DOI: 10.3384/ecp17138209

This article suggests updating pedagogical and
curriculum approaches by transforming learning
materials using state-of-the-art multimedia - e.g., using
AVR, and Mixed Reality (MR). Student’s attention and
motivation are key factors for academic performance
(Savage et al., 2011, Panisoara et al., 2015, Harandi,
2015, Law et al., 2010, Mendez and Gonzalez, 2011).
Hence the aim is to encourage active learning by
delivering interactivity into traditionally passive
learning approaches and materials - e.g., lectures and
textbooks.
Gamification in engineering education has not been
fully adopted in schools, although the benefits of
gamification have been shown in other fields (Pedreira
et al., 2015, Dubois and Tamburrelli, 2013, Vasilescu,
2014, Hamari et al., 2014). Learning is best achieved
through experiences - i.e., by using gamification to
make tasks challenging and more engaging (Hamari et
al., 2016, Ibáñez et al., 2014, Li et al., 2012, Barata et
al., 2013b). Gamification supports peer-to-peer
collaboration, social interaction and transcultural
communication (Ducheneaut and Moore, 2004, Thorne,
2008, Thorne et al., 2009). Scholars have presented an
AR crossover gamified design for engineering
education in high school (Salman and Riley, 2016).
Research has also posed a framework for using MR in
gamification to assist teaching and learning in ICT
(Muñoz et al., 2016). Active engagement and game
challenges lead to improved learning processes and
student outcomes (Guillén-Nieto and Aleson-Carbonell,
2012, Nicholson, 2015, Barata et al., 2013a, Domínguez
et al., 2013, Clark et al., 2011).
MR provides immersive and engaging experiences
through creative problem solving (Gardner and Elliott,
2014, Lindgren et al., 2016, Janßen et al., 2016,
Thornhill-Miller and Dupont, 2016). MR has the
potential to be a transformative technology in education
- i.e., the ability to evoke empathy and the ability to trick
the brain into experiencing another environment as real.
Social media are not implemented in curriculum
although they can play important role as a beneficial
infrastructure in learning processes (Krokan, 2012).
Sharing allows students to collaborate and compete on
assignments. Furthermore, social media often supports
intercultural adaptation (Sawyer, 2011, Kosinski et al.,
2015).
MR allows users to perceive the real world while
virtual elements are superimposed upon or composited
with the real world in real-time. Therefore, this article
proposes to implement MR technologies to enhance
learning, which may be applicable as an educational
technology in various engineering courses.
The AVR-lab promotes the inclusion of new
technology, teachers and all students - i.e., the target
audience comprises students who experience barriers
using traditional learning materials, students not
engaged in engineering as a field of study, and students

with disabilities. Research has yet to examine the
usability and accessibility of MR educational
technologies for students with physical, sensory or
cognitive disabilities.
Demands for MR-competences are increasing in the
labour market and industry in Norway (Urke, 2016,
Armstrong, 2017). However, MR as a pedagogical tool
has yet to fulfill these demands and has yet to be fully
adopted in the Norwegian education system. One
exception is the one year programme in AVR at
Høgskolen i Innlandet (INN, 2017). Nevertheless,
governmental and institutional support for using AVR
in education has yet to fully emerge. The Norwegian
technology sector and entrepreneurs have yet to fully
embrace MR as an educational technology and a viable
business venture.
Regarding engineering education in higher education,
a survey has been carried out at HiOA based on data
from internal, external and student reports (Cibulka,
2017). The survey reveals the following common
problems: fixed learning style; non-inclusive education;
lack of motivation and engagement; less graduates;
infrastructure issues; high drop-out rate; lonely students;
low competence prerequisites from high school; lack of
teacher’s feedback; high students-to-faculty ratio; staff
shortage; overworked staff; lack of research and
development (R&D) activities; lack of student R&D
extracurricular activities; lack of supervision; low
attendance in lectures; labs and group classes; low levels
of encouragement; equipment issues; lack of adoption
of recent educational technology; lack of clarification of
concepts and theories; poor results in exams (high
failure-rate); lack of applicants, low recruitment, lack of
attractiveness, lack of uniqueness; students have
personal obligations; teachers missing tools (technology
gap, training gap); teacher’s knowledge gap; decisionmakers missing knowledge; equipment cost;
environmental load.
Engineering in higher education also experiences a
high drop-out rate in mathematics (58% at HiOA).
Research shows the economic benefit for the Norwegian
economy if fewer students drop-out – i.e.,
approximately 1 million NOK per student (Falch et al.,
2009, E24, 2013, Tunstad, 2013, Holstad, 2016).
Furthermore, higher education institutions lose income
for each student who fails a course and who drops out of
a degree program.

State-of-the-Art

MR has been proven as efficient educational tool in
many recent academic and magazine articles. A search
in both popular and scientific literature has been
conducted. Positive experiences with AVR in
engineering education have shown that students selfmotivation and performance increases as well as an
attractiveness of the new ICT-enhanced classes.

Pearson, the leader in educational courseware,
collaborate with Microsoft on MR learning content for
colleges, universities and secondary schools (Overland,
2016). (Kosowatz, 2017) summarized current
engineering applications (civil eng., manufacturing,
mining, maintenance, medical) of MR and its further
potential. (Park, 2016) presented MR platform Peer
(internet-enabled sensors and headset) for middle school
students allowing interaction with visualized abstract
concepts and complex forces.
(Wu et al., 2013) presented current AR technologies
used in education as a productive concept for educators,
researchers, and designers. Three categories of
instructional AR approaches to help students in learning
are presented: roles, tasks and locations. The solutions
for AR-related challenges for educators and students are
also proposed, i.e. technological (multiple devices),
pedagogical and learning issues (cognitive overloading,
complex tasks).
(Kirner et al., 2012) presented a concept of AR
multiple-point 3D artifacts allowing precise action point
interactions and thus reduce the amount of markers. The
empowered artifact with smart AR reactions is an
authoring tool with use in education and cognitive
rehabilitation. Tests shown its low cost, availability,
user-friendly interfaces, multi-sensory, tangible
interaction and non-demanding dexterity.
(Gutiérrez Martín and Meneses Fernández, 2014)
presented a state-of-the-art review of AR in higher
education in engineering, training and multimedia. This
paper practically demonstrated its benefits in
comparison with traditional instructional learning. AR
effects enhances, motivates and stimulates the learning
process by interacting on the augmented environments.
This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of AVR in
education of Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics (STEM). The use of MR-pedagogy in
engineering education was explored, particularly in
chemistry, physics, automation, electrical, civil and
mechanical engineering.
Ad electrical eng., (Martín-Gutiérrez et al., 2015)
presented empirical study of 3 AR-Apps, incl.
interactive learning scenarios. Tests were carried out
with students of electrical engineering, specifically
electrical machines course. Both autonomous studying
and collaborative lab practices were evaluated
positively (in usability and feedback surveys). The need
for a teacher’s assistance was reduced.
a) ElectARmanual
Authors tested AR-manual as a solution for
overcrowded lab for electric machines, incl. 3D models
and animations, wiring diagrams and sounds (MartinGutierrez et al., 2012). The App assists with sequential
instructions to fulfill different tasks, e.g. installations
and configurations of electrical machines.

b) ELECT3D
This Android AR-App enhances reading and
comprehension of circuit diagrams, drawings, electrical
symbols (both complex and realistic) and images. The
App is universal since it uses extended library of
normalized standard symbols and objects. AR is
performed “marker-less”, i.e. by means of cloud of
points (normalized symbol).
c) ElectAR_notes
In order to explain abstract (invisible) and difficult
topics, principles and concepts in electrical engineering
(vectors, electromagnetism, ferromagnetism, electrical
machines), the notes book (Basic Electrical Machines)
were enhanced with AR content, e.g. images, 3D
objects, 3D animations; audio, video and text
explanations. Such upgraded and interactive notes led to
better interlink between theoretical (abstract) and
practical teaching. The AR-notes have double AR-mark,
i.e. both marker-less image and fiducial 4x4 AR-mark.
(Desai et al., 2013) included interactive features
between multiple virtual electrical 3D components to
complete and simulate simple circuits. Users
appreciated understanding the causal relationship based
on the changes made to the parameter of the 3D
electrical components. (Souza and Kirner, 2012)
presented AR-tool to practice simple circuits tasks
related to electromagnetism.
Ad automation, (Frank and Kapila, 2017) integrated
MMR (tablet) to interact with motor test-bed in lab
activities. Students demonstrated improvement in their
knowledge of dynamic systems and control concept.
Ad Physics, (Chi-Poot and Martin-Gonzalez, 2014)
presented using AR in learning of Euclidean vectors
properties. The system aids the user to understand
physical concepts, such as magnitude and direction,
along with operations like addition, subtraction and
cross product of vectors. Kinect sensor was used to
visualize virtual components merged in a userinteraction (body interactive) environment. Users were
able to virtually create vectors with different magnitudes
and directions, and visualize their properties and
operations.
Ad Chemical engineering, (Andrade et al., 2014, Maier
and Klinker, 2013b, Maier and Klinker, 2013a, Maier
and Klinker, 2013c) demonstrated a haptic wireless
hand held device, i.e. an AR cubic-marker tool, and the
tracking software “Augmented Chemical Reactions”.
This tool enables 3D molecules visualization,
visualizing chemical properties, spatial relations and
free direct manipulation with 3D interaction methods.
The user immersion in chemistry learning had been
improved, in comparison with a 2D representation in
textbooks and molecular formula. The included
chemical dynamics simulation helps to grasp the

DOI: 10.3384/ecp17138209

abstract internals of chemical reactions (dynamics of the
atoms in and between molecules). This AR tool also
helps researchers in prototyping, developing and
understanding new chemical molecules. Gesture control
(a self-tuning gesture recognition algorithm) allows
prototyping with creating multiple bonds between two
virtual molecules.
(Cai et al., 2014) presented an empirical case study
with interactive 3D AR-models to control and visualize
abstract
chemical
structures,
microstructures,
composition of substances and concepts. Study also
included set of inquiry-based AR learning tools. Data
analysis has shown the AR tool improved cognitive
performance and is effective for low-achieving students.
Ad mechanical eng., Autodesk and Microsoft integrates
CAD software Fusion 360 into collaborative MR-app
“FreeForm” for HoloLens, (Gardiner, 2015).
EON Reality, the worldwide leader in the field of
interactive training (Cheben, 2017), and educational
software (Singletary, 2017), presented AR Diesel
Engine Training (Hio, 2016).
(Martín-Gutiérrez, 2011, Gutiérrez Martín and
Meneses Fernández, 2014) introduced an augmented
book for mechanical engineering course “L-Elira”. The
virtual machine elements are represented by matching
technical card containing information, e.g. use, rule
number, standard element designation, graphic
information, photorealistic images and an AR marker.
AR fiducial marker allows visualization and animation
of the 3D model. The authors reported in (Gutierrez and
Fernandez, 2014) a better academic results and
motivation of the first year mechanical engineering
students. The exam results showed a significant
statistical difference between academic performances of
two groups (AR and classical notes), proving to be
higher in the experimental group (AR); this group also
showed a higher level of motivation than the control
group (classical notes).
(Martín-Gutiérrez et al., 2010, Gutiérrez Martín and
Meneses Fernández, 2014) introduced an augmented
book AR-Dehaes for improving spatial abilities of
mechanical engineering students by providing 3D
virtual models and visualization tasks. A validation
study of the remedial course confirmed positive impact
on students’ spatial ability.
(Rizov and Rizova, 2015) presented the benefits of
using AR in higher education, by measuring outcomes
(improved results) of the students which used AR as a
teaching tool in the mechanical engineering course.
Ad Civil eng., Microsoft, Trimble and University of
Cambridge collaborate towards MR-apps for MS
HoloLens (Scialom, 2017), e.g. SketchUp Viewer
(Vardhan, 2016).

(Vassigh et al., 2016) presented AR-app AR-SKOPE
for civil engineering education with integrated Building
Information Modelling, showing the building’s
mechanical system information overlaid on the real
building.
(Shirazi and Behzadan, 2015) presented a building
structure model assembly using wooden blocks,
equipped with AR-markers in order to teach abstract
construction and civil engineering topics in a practical
manner. This AR-based pedagogical tool led to a better
performance, collaboration, communication and
autonomous learning experience. Students in the test
session worked in groups and received instructions from
the virtual avatar, and scanned the tracking image
attached to each building element to access information.
(Kirner et al., 2012) presented AR Spatial Tutor, a
tool for interaction with panels and mockups
(Styrofoam) using AR, to expose AR-layer (dynamic
content), 3D objects, annotations, sounds and
animations. Interactive points have multiple information
elements that allow the expansion of contents or the
fulfilling of different types of users.
As conclusion, the State-of-the-Art review revealed
current trends in AR-Apps for engineering education.
Good results from the exams and feedback surveys
indicate beneficial use in engineering degrees. ARapproach can be applied in different engineering courses
due to similar didactics and software. However,
complex dynamic simulations are still missing in current
AR-apps. Simulations should be implemented since it is
important to see and understand any system response.
For example, to study electrical circuits it is vital to
understand the effects of value adjustment or component
configuration. The training framework including instant
learning feedback of learning outcome is also missing.

Current learning approaches does not reflect each
individual student’s skills and learning style. The ARApp should include feedback learning system with
interactive examples and tasks. Such feedback is
beneficial for student/teacher, allowing them to track the
learning effectiveness and focus on difficult parts.
Utilization of advances in Biofeedback and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) is missing.

Concept of AVR-lab “Mi-ity”

We will utilize novel mobile MR solutions. We will
focus on an engineer from the life-span perspective, i.e.
all age scholar groups from kindergarten towards adult
vocational training. We will establish hub “Mi-ity”, the
mobile MR innovation hub for lifelong engineering
education, at HiOA, together with our key industrial
partners. The hub concept is illustrated in Figure 1.
We will test both engineering and non-engineering
students to reveal if MR has positive learning effect
(high learning outcomes) regardless background and
interest. Mi-ity targets 3 user groups in lifelong spectra:
students, teachers and decision makers. Testing and
validation of MR-apps will be conducted in the selected
pilot courses. We will conduct experiments in
cooperation with our research and user partners.
4.1 Development of MR-education
The learning modules with MR will be designed based
on the didactic model presented by (Bjørndal and
Lieberg, 1978). Didactic model is used to design all the
learning modules in a course.
Universal Design for Learning (Rose et al., 2005) is
a reference model that will guide the development of
educational MR-contents and practices, i.e. enables the
learning process to be more accessible, universally

designed and inclusive for all students, incl. with
learning or sensory disabilities.
MR platform comprises challenging tasks with
gamification features. It covers engineering-related
topics: mathematics, mechanical, electrical, control,
biochemistry etc.
4.2 MR tool “MixRALF”
The new MR tool will cover virtual teaching contents, a
multi-platform and interactive MR-Apps, learning
feedback system, dynamic simulations, biofeedback and
integration to social media.
We will develop “MixRALF”, the mobile mixedreality system with the real-time autonomous learning
feedback. MixRALF comprises MR, academic
biosyncing (biometric wearables) and AI, see Figure 2.
This unique combination has not been reported yet.
MR educational and engineering-related content will
be developed in multiplatform tools, e.g. EON Studio,
Unity 3D and Unreal. The MR content is scalable in
both platform compatibility (smartphone ↔ headset)
and contents (kindergarten ↔ university).
Microsoft HoloLens, a self-contained wearable
holographic computer, will be used as mobile MR
headset. We will also test wireless HTC Vive and
smartphones.
We will further enhance the immersive MRexperience with an academic biosyncing. Academic
biosyncing is a new concept of bio-mechanical
symbiosis where scholar and machine are in a reactive,
performance-augmenting loop, by means of
biofeedback (biometric data, wearables) and AI, see
Figure 2. Similarly to athletic biosyncing, it is expected
that scholar change learning routines, i.e. enters into an
automatic reactive state.
We will use biometric wearables to measure focus
level, engagement, excitement or stress. Selected

biometric wearables: Insight by Emotiv (EEG headset
for brain activity); wristband E4 by Empatica (galvanic
skin response - electrodermal activity sensor,
cardiovascular features - blood volume pulse, heart beat,
heart rate variability, blood pressure etc.), see Figure 3.

Figure 3: Emotiv Insight (EEG headset) and wristband
Empatica E4 (electrodermal and cardiovascular activity)

Voice (tone), gesture (controlled commands) and facial
reaction recognition is already possible with HoloLens.
Eye movement tracking is possible with HTC Vive
(Durbin, 2017), and will be integrated in the next
version of HoloLens as well (Walker, 2017).
MixRALF system comprises “Big Data” problem to
be solved by AI. Integrative AI, i.e. generative AI and
MR, will provide awareness about cognitive state, focus
level and mental preparedness, and thus improve
educational experiences in combination with MR. AI
can be in the form of virtual teacher, capable to
recognize skills, learning style and mental state. He (AI)
will customize the learning approach and contents
accordingly, to fit each individual student, i.e. he will
track and train focus, and track and improve educational
experiences.
For this mission we have selected IBM Watson
(Bluemix developer platform) as the best AI technology.
It is an advance AI cognitive system, already
successfully proven in educational experiments (Goel et
al., 2015, Goel, 2016). HiOA is the first “WatsonUniversity” in Norway.

AI will also utilize digital footprints to recognize
student’s personally traits and mental state by digital
means, e.g. intelligence, basic emotions etc. (Lambiotte
and Kosinski, 2014). Introverts tend to belong to fewer
but larger and denser communities, while extroverts
tend to act as bridges between more frequent, smaller,
and overlapping communities.
(Kosinski et al., 2016) presented methods to extract
patterns and build predictive models using large data
sets of digital footprints (mining big data). (Youyou et
al., 2015) demonstrated that AI can predict personality,
based on digital footprints, automatically and more
accurately than human (friend), i.e. without involving
human social-cognitive skills. AI and digital footprints
will further help to state the learning ability and thus
help to select the optimal MR tool for the best learning
outcome.
With the help of AI and biometrics the scholar will be
able to respond to its learning environments and more
fully realize its learning potential. Student become
aware of its cognitive state, mental preparedness and
focus level, and thus improve educational experiences.
The whole-body wellness and overall activity will be
tracked and better understood. AI will identify personal
traits and mental states of a student.
MixRALF will track and evaluate student’s
performance with combination of qualitative
(observation by AI) and quantitative data (score, time,
task statistics, biometrics), and adjust the individual
learning approach accordingly. For example, the system
identifies if student is bored and thus offer him a more
challenging tasks and engagement in his studies. It will
also feature the dynamic difficulty, i.e. AI will adjust the
difficulty of task instantaneously, based on the real-time
feedback. Thus AI decrease the difficulty level for

failing student in order to keep him engaged, motivated
and prevent frustration, and vice versa, AI increases
difficulty for prospering student.
MixRALF will output self-contained results about
student’s learning outcome and recommendation for
improvement, i.e. includes feedback about scoring,
time, interpretation of results and task statistics, e.g.
design-related parameters such as cost, reliability,
lifetime, stress strength etc. The feedback on learning
progress will be available for students, teachers and
decision makers, incl. comprehensive methodology to
evaluate the study progress. The key performance
indicators are learning outcomes, e.g. speed of learning.
4.3 Expected benefits
The potential for value creation is illustrated in Figure
4. Mi-ity will train next-gen students and teachers in the
use of MR in educational settings and real pedagogical
practice, i.e. reduce gap between education and new
ICT.
Lab will provide rich, interactive, responsive and
accessible learning experience. Real-time feedback and
adjustment of learning scenario allows individual
approach, i.e. for both students with disabilities and
students with an over average mental capacity.
Mi-ity will promote active participation in lifelong
learning process. Mi-ity enable faster adoption of
Problem-based Learning and Flipped Classrooms by
using MR-tools in interactive learning activities and
teaching practice. MixRALF will increase the learning
outcomes, i.e. students recognize, identify and grasp the
knowledge, especially abstract concepts, faster and
more meaningfully.
With AI training guidance the student will study
independently and thus saves the teacher’s time.

Teacher will have more time for creative work such as
content development, class preparation, R&D,
publishing etc. Teacher will be able to provide closer
individual feedback to the student and encourage his
critical thinking, reflection and creativity.
Decision makers will get more and accurate
information/knowledge to perform better decisions
about
programs,
investments,
quality
and
improvements.
Mi-ity will reduce drop-out rate and thus reduce high
expenses related to the failure-rate. The new educational
system will increase the attractiveness of engineering
curriculum and thus improve the recruitment of
applicants.
Students will become better engineers and meet the
increasing demands for MR-competences in labour
market and industry in Norway. MR-enhanced
curriculum will result in faster and effective
development of engineering competences, i.e.
instrumental competences (analysis and synthesis skills,
planning and organization skills, solving problems,
managing information as well as taking decisions),
personal
competences
(teamwork,
workplace
interpersonal relations skills, critical reasoning),
systemic skills (autonomous learning, leadership,
initiative, entrepreneur, motivation for quality) and
spatial skills. Students become self-motivated,
independent and competent professional, reducing the
ad-hoc occupational training cost.
Project promotes entrepreneurship in education
technologies (release new MR apps) by collaboration of
partners, HW- and SW-related students.
MR replaces physical equipment and thus eliminate
the safety risk, expenses and power. Training with
virtual equipment decreases a fear for further real
practice with e.g. electric circuits, soldering, welding
etc. MR decrease demands and cost for physical
infrastructure e.g. study rooms, labs, auditoriums. MR
shifts physical learning space into a virtual learning
environment, which also allows student’s remote
participation.
MR, gamification and social media will diminish the
intercultural differences and support better cooperation
and communication between peers with different
cultural background.

Conclusion

The State-of-the-Art review revealed positive
experiences with application of MR in engineering
education. However, the recent solutions does not
reflect advances in biofeedback wearables and AI,
towards further improvement of learning feedback and
outcome. Therefore we proposed a project concept of
AVR-lab, where we will test the mobile MR in closedloop combination with biometrics and AI. We focus on
improving student’s learning performance and teacher’s

DOI: 10.3384/ecp17138209

knowledge transfer in the lifelong perspective. The realtime learning feedback will tailor the educational
approach to fit each student individually. The new
autonomous learning system will allow independent
study and thus save the teacher’s time. Gamification of
task challenges will create an attractive and motivational
tool for the student. The new MR-enhanced curriculum
will reflect the rapidly increasing competence demands
for MR technology in the engineering industry and labor
market in Norway.
