Abstract:
Currently, the radiofrequency (RF)-based wireless technology deployed in
electroencephalography (EEG) to diagnose brain diseases suffers from frequency spectrum and
electromagnetic interference, and might also have adverse effects on the health of patients and
equipment used in hospitals, especially in RF-restricted zones like intensive care units (ICUs). Optical
wireless communication (OWC), specifically visible light communication (VLC), is featured in 5G
network to complement the radiofrequency (RF) technologies due to the fact that huge unlicensed
bandwidth and available infrastructure, both indoor and outdoor, reduces the implementation
cost. The conventional VLC systems deploy photodiodes as receivers, requiring hardware and
infrastructure modifications in addition to smaller field of view (FOV), but the use of cameras
reduce the infrastructure cost due to inbuilt filters and a wider FOV coverage gives the ability to
scale a larger area. The wider FOV and the movement of camera rotation, without any additional
adjustments to maintain the line-of-sight (LOS), allows the patient to be anywhere within the room
and FOV. This paper demonstrates a novel healthcare system for EEG using visible light optical
camera communication (VL-OCC), where a 32 × 32 pixel OLED screen acts as transmitter and the
receiver section consists of several different cameras such as digital single-lens reflex camera (DLSR),
android smartphone, and Thorlabs camera. The experiments were performed in LOS deploying
on-off keying (OOK) modulation at several distant measurements to determine the system reliability
and stability through bit error rate (BER) performance. The proposed system results depict that the
DSLR camera outperforms the smartphone and Thorlabs cameras, as it is capable of transmitting an
error free bit rate of 2.8 kbps at 30 fps up to 5.5 m.

1. Introduction
Electroencephalography (EEG), discovered in 1924 by Hans Berger, is a non-invasive procedure to
diagnose brain diseases. The conventional EEG recording techniques are deployed by using several
scalp electrodes, which involves a long preparation time and are tedious. However, the growth of
wireless technology has led to wearable EEG headsets that are used for brain monitoring for specific
applications, such as Nuerosky, Imec, emotive, etc. [1]. Furthermore, the radiofrequency (RF)-based
technology, such as Bluetooth and ZigBee, are used in many EEG machines for data communication,
but the RF technologies suffer from lack of frequency spectrum, eavesdropping, and electromagnetic
interference [2–5]. VLC can be used for both for lighting and data communication hence, the use

of LED lights, existing everywhere, for data communication is a cost-effective alternative to RF
technology, specifically in hospitals and indoor environments [6–8]. In comparison to RF, the VLC
spectrum is 10,000 times the RF spectrum, license free, and unregulated, hence it could be used for data
communication [9]. VLC deploys light waves for communication, which are insensitive to electronic
equipment; therefore, free from electromagnetic interference and thus best suited in healthcare
applications, especially in RF-restricted areas such as intensive care units (ICUs) [10,11]. Since the lights
are easily blocked by non-transparent object such as walls, hence visible light communication is more
secure in comparison to RF, infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) communications [12]. Additionally, the
light confines the information to optics and within the premises of a VLC-based system, hence VLC does
not suffer from eavesdropping [13]. Hence, in past years, several studies were conducted on visible light
communication in different areas of research, such as indoor positioning [6,13–16], vehicle-to-vehicle
communication [7,17–19], environmental monitoring [8,20], and IoT applications [21,22]. It is due to
the capability of providing both illumination and data communication unlike other OWC systems.
Nowadays, in VLC systems, the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) is replacing the
conventionally-used transmitter, such as the white LED, because of low cost and flexibility [9,10];
however, the VLC-based LEDs/OLED systems employ a photodiode (PD) as the receiver (Rx). The VLC
systems deploying a conventional PD as the receiver requires hardware modifications due to additional
filters and amplifier circuitry; therefore, in order to provide low-cost flexible wireless communications,
a camera is the best solution to be deployed as the receiver in VLC systems [10,11]. Cameras are
ubiquitous and increasingly being used not just for capturing images but also for communicating
information. The universal access of Quick Response Code (QR) codes motivates deploying novel
camera communication applications, where pervasive display screens could be modulated to send time
varying QR codes to be decoded by video cameras. The pixel elements of the screen and camera can be
leveraged to send data through time-varying 2D barcodes [11–13]. Optical camera communication is a
recent development of OWC and an extension of VLC, where image sensors or cameras are used for
sensing the light intensity emitted from a light emitter instead of conventional photodiodes. Optical
camera communication (OCC) is a pragmatic version of visible light communication (VLC) using a
camera as the receiver. OCC operates in the same channel band as VLC with more advantages on
receiver characteristics and has been studied in the IEEE 802.15 SG7a within the framework of optical
wireless communications and considered as a candidate of IEEE 802.15.7rl [12–14]. The OCC has an
inherent advantage of capturing 2-dimensional (2D) image data, compared with intensity level-based
photodiodes in VLC [12]. The popularity of smart devices and the camera installed in every smart
device has resulted in the use of a camera as a receiver for communication purposes in VLC systems.
In conventional VLC systems, PD is the receiver which requires hardware modification due to filters
and amplifiers; however, with the receiver being the camera the cost of implementation is considerably
reduced due to inbuilt filters and focusing properties, reducing the unwanted noise [12,13]. Bit
Error Rate (BER) is calculated by comparing the transmitted and received data bits through images
such as The QR code obtained at receiver section through image capture can be easily compared to
the transmitted image in 2D to calculate BER and to analyse the system performance. The several
modulation and demodulation techniques of VLC are used for OCC, as OCC is an extension of VLC,
hence the modulation techniques of VLC can be easily incorporated on visible light optical camera
communication (VL-OCC).
The VL-OCC aims to use commercial LED- or OLED-based infrastructure lighting as the transmitter,
and the receiver being the camera. The VL-OCC technology employing the OLED screen as transmitter
and the camera as receiver is believed to play an important role in the provision of internet of thing (IoT)
and the 5G wireless network [13,14]. Furthermore, the camera focussing ability mitigates the blurring
and the inbuilt filters automatically filter the unwanted noise, without any infrastructure modifications
unlike conventional VLC systems that have a PD as the receiver. The concept of transmitting a 1D
signal in the digitized form using the On-Off Keying Non-Return to Zero (OOK-NRZ) modulation
scheme in a 2D image, with an OLED screen as transmitter and a camera as receiver makes VLC an

good alternative to RF communications for data transmission. The adverse impacts of RF signals on
human wellbeing and interferences to other medical electronic devices have been in particularly in
hospitals. Moreover, it has been stated by the World Health Organization that RF has the possibility of
causing cancer in humans [10–13]. The fact that VLC is more friendly to human and medical electronics
is one of the main advantages of using VLC in medicinal services or healthcare. Therefore, this research
work proposes a novel VL-OCC-based wireless healthcare system for EEG, using the screen of an OLED
as the transmitter and a camera as the receiver. Experiments were carried out in line of sight (LOS)
using on-off keying non return to zero (OOK_NRZ) modulation in a realistic medical scenario, with
the patient being in the vicinity of the field of view (FOV) of the camera. The camera, having a wider
FOV than conventional photodiodes, can scan a larger area, hence the patient can be anywhere within
the room. Furthermore, rotating the camera to maintain the LOS is easily feasible, unlike conventional
VLC systems deploying photodiodes. The proposed system’s experimental results of transmitting the
EEG signal in 1D to a 2D image shows that that the system can communicate up to distance of 5.5 m at
a camera frame rate of 30 fps, achieving a bit rate of 2.8 kbps.
Our contribution: There are three main contributions in this research paper.

•

The link distance of 5.5 m is achieved, in comparison to the results of available literature of EEG
and VLC.
The proposed system will be beneficial in the healthcare environment, such as hospitals, where
the RF technology is expensive and suffers from Electromagnetic Interference (EMI).
Due to bit rate being limited by camera frame rate, the achievable rate in the proposed research
work in this paper is 2.8 kbps. The bit rate of 2.8 kbps is enough to transmit single-channel EEG
transmission using VL-OCC.

The remaining paper is divided into different sections: Section 2 lists the related works; Section 3
narrates the system architecture and applications of VL-OCC; Section 4 illustrates the proposed system
model for EEG using VL-OCC; Section 5 the experimental work with results; and the conclusion is
listed in Section 6.
2. Related Works
Here, the related work is divided into two sub sections. In Section 2.1, we list the present EEG
procedure in hospitals and the commercial RF-based EEG products, and in Section 2.2 we list the
related work on visible light communication for EEG.
2.1. Current EEG Procedure in Hospitals and RF-Based EEG Products
The current EEG procedure in hospitals involved deployed wet electrodes, thus resulting in long
preparation time, which was not only tedious and time consuming but also resulted in discomfort to
patients [23]. In context, to overcome the problem of wet electrodes, several researchers moved to dry
electrodes for EEG brain monitoring. The authors in [24] mentioned that, in comparison to traditional
EEG brain monitoring, existing EEG wireless devices deploy dry electrodes; however, a direct link
between the scalp and electrodes is prevented by hair, thus resulting the path being obstructed in EEG
signal measurement. Usually, the conventional silver–silver chloride electrodes with conductive gels
were used to record EEG; however, conductive gels can dry and become hard over long-term EEG
monitoring. Therefore, the EEG signal captured is not accurate due to there being no proper contact
between the scalp and the electrode [25]. In [26], the authors proposed a comb-shaped electrode,
whereby the hair could be easily moved, hence the electrode could easily reach the scalp, thus providing
accurate EEG monitoring. However, it was only deployed in brain computer applications. The authors
in [27] employed metal pogo probes for brain monitoring; despite high precision the dry sensors caused
discomfort to users after several hours. The single-channel EEG monitoring was proposed by authors
in [28], using Bluetooth technology to transmit data wirelessly whereby the single cylindrically-shaped
electrode was used for brain monitoring. However, RF technology using systems like Bluetooth and

Zigbee for wireless transmission affect system performance in RF sensitive areas, such as hospitals,
aircrafts, etc., due to electromagnetic interference. The authors in [29] deployed in-ear sensors for brain
monitoring; however, despite of the low-input impedance of the sensors, were unable to provide a
comprehensive study of the brain.
The pathway between a computer device and the brain is known as the brain–computer interface
(BCI) [30,31]. Neurosky is most commonly used in BCI and is based on one channel measurement
using dry electrodes. It is used to study a specific section or part of the brain [32]. Another most
commonly-used EEG product is Emotiv, which provides 12 h continuous wireless transmission through
a radio. However, the continuous monitoring for 12 h using RF technology might have adverse effects
on patients’ health due to electromagnetic interference [33]. The EEG product designed by authors
in [34] is G.Nautilus, and is a lightweight device that is preferred for the comprehensive study of the
brain due to EEG recordings from several channels. Mindo-4 is another BCI EEG product mainly
deployed in gaming applications and to measure sleep disorders, and it has a weight of 250 g and
a battery life of 10 h. The dry sensors are preferred in EEG, in comparison to wet sensors, due to
the long preparation time of wet sensors and them being uncomfortable for patients [35]. In order
to measure the mood in people, Cognionics or Quick 20 is widely used, operating wirelessly at a
frequency ranging from 0–131 Hz at 500 samples/s with 64 channels, and at a frequency ranging from
0–262 Hz at 1000 samples/s with 32 channels [36]. Enobio, another EEG wearable system, is preferred
for the recording of EEG, which is best for applications such as sleep studies [37].
The applications of EEG devices vary, and the selection of EEG products depends upon the
requirement of individual applications with consideration of following key parameters such as
sampling rate, resolution, battery life and number of electrodes. For example, for brain monitoring, if
the number of channels required is 1, and a bandwidth ranging between 3–100 Hz at a sampling rate of
512 Hz and battery life of 8 h is needed, Neurosky is the best choice [32]. These wireless RF-based EEG
products are used in EEG for certain applications, but none of them has been considerably deployed in
hospitals due to electromagnetic interference. In order to overcome the above-illustrated problems of
current RF-based wireless wearable EEG systems in RF sensitive areas, the proposed EEG systems
must be EMI free, unlike the traditional systems which are tedious, wired, have EMI, and provide
discomfort to patients [4,38]. In view of the shortcomings of EEG products based on RF technology,
VLC is the promising solution due to low implementation cost, security, no eavesdropping, and being
free from EMI [12].
2.2. Recent Work on Visible Light Communication for EEG
VLC has been extensively used in areas such as vehicle-to-vehicle communication, Light -Fidelity
(Li-FI), underwater applications, and military applications, but the research work of VLC for EEG in
healthcare has just begun over the past few years [5]. In healthcare applications, specifically EEG,
due to low cost, being free from EMI, and reliability, several researchers have moved to VLC from
RF technology. In the VLC system, the transmitter can be LED, or OLED, and the receiver can be
a photodiode or a camera. Due to the low data rate limit of cameras, photodiodes are deployed
as receivers in VLC systems; however, this option does require hardware modifications. Several
researchers have proposed their VLC system for EEG signal transmission comprising of both types of
transmitters and receivers.
In [3], a VLC system deploying a LED/PD pair of RGB (red, green and blue) achieved a data rate
of 4 kbps at a distance of 50 cm for EEG signal transmission. However, an array of three transmitters
and three photodiodes were used to transmit and receive the EEG signal, hence added towards the cost
and hardware modifications. The authors in [39] proposed a brain health monitoring system based on
Support Vector Machine (SVM) for daily monitoring using Bluetooth, an RF protocol suffering from
EMI and not applicable in RF sensitive areas. The authors in [40] achieved a data rate of 2 kbps using
VL-OCC for EEG signal transmission; however, the distance achieved was 50 cm. In [41], authors
demonstrated a wearable EEG system using a single electrode based on a mobile phone VLC, achieving

Thereafter, the camera was used to capture a video, which was followed by processing of images and
threshold detection in MATLAB, to decode the images and bits, to get the original EEG signal and to
calculate BER. The nomenclature is listed in Table 1.

The bits transmitted through the OLED screen were received by the camera at different distances
to calculate the BER and to depict the successful transmission of the EEG signal. The video captured by
camera was downloaded to MATLAB using a USB cable or memory card; thereafter offline processing
was done to determine the BER at different distances. In the experiment, the ambient light was kept
very low to avoid interference to the receiver.
5. Experiments and Results
This section is subdivided into three different modules. Section 5.1 lists the extraction of the EEG
signal from the EEGLAB Open Source Matlab Toolbox and the signal processing of the EEG signal in
MATLAB. Section 5.2 explains the experimental work and hardware description, while the results are
listed in Section 5.3.
5.1. Extraction of EEG Signal from EEGtoolbox
This section illustrates EEG signal extraction from EEGLAB Open Source Matlab Toolbox followed
by pre-signal processing.
Initially, the EEG signal was obtained from the EEGLAB Open Source Matlab Toolbox known as
EEGlab. The EEGlab is a software designed by researchers in the US to extract the EEG signals using
MATLAB and to use these EEG signals for laboratory research work [51]. The signal obtained from
EEGlab using MATLAB is shown in Figure 4a. The EEG signal had an amplitude of millivolts and the
number of samples taken in our experimental work were 1000 for transmission. The optical channel
transmits the optical intensity, which cannot be negative, hence the EEG signal was normalized in the
range of 0 to 1, as shown in Figure 4b. Thereafter, the signal obtained in digital form was up-sampled
for optical transmission to aid in reconstruction of the original signal transmitted at the receiver (later
stage). Then the useful bits obtained were transferred to the microcontroller using a USB cable.

bits obtained after signal processing were uploaded to the microcontroller-embedded system using
C programming code and MBED software. The uploaded bits were sent through a switch board or
potentiometer to the OLED screen. The switch board acted as a bridge between the microcontroller
and the OLED screen. The voltage regulator was designed using KICAD software and the LM series
741 op-amp was used due to simplicity and being readily available. The voltage regulator was used to
regulate the dual supply voltage to 3.3 V for the evaluation board of the OLED screen, through Drain
Supply (VDD). Hence, in a single frame of the OLED screen, with pixel size of 32, a total of 30 symbols
or data bits could be transmitted. The information bits were converted into an image and transmitted
over the optical channel, captured by the camera at the receiver section, and then followed by offline
processing in MATLAB.
The transmitted bits go through the optical channel, received by a camera in video form; thereafter,
image processing in MATLAB was conducted to determine BER and system reliability. The camera
parameters are listed in Table 3. The length of the video captured by a camera is given by

For the image processing and to detect the border for image detection, matrix formed of rows
and columns of 4 × 5 was used instead of 5 × 6. Therefore, in this experimental work, the useful bits
transmitted per single frame of 32 × 32 pixel size were counted as 20, comprising of four rows and five
columns, Hence, the length of video required is given by
Length o f video =

2.8 kbps
= 140 s or 2.3 min

The length of video is useful in determining the exact time to stop the video, which helps in saving
both time and memory. The 2.3 min video could transmit a bit rate of 2.8 kbps without any additional
infrastructure, as LED lights are installed, and without hardware modifications by using a camera as
the receiver, unlike VLC systems deploying photodiodes as the receiver.
5.3. Results Analysis and Discussion
During the experimental work, the three different sets of experiments were carried out with three
different cameras to examine the system performance. Figure 7 shows the image processing of the
OLED screen at pixel size 32 × 32. The advantage of the VL-OCC system is that the system can be used
both for online processing and saved later for processing purposes, depending upon the application.
Presently, in the experimental work, the EEG signal transmitted, captured by the camera in video form,
was processed offline using MATLAB to calculate BER and to determine the performance of the system

recording is required from a couple of seconds to a few minutes to detect brain activity. The proposed
system has a potential crucial future impact and is investigated in order to be deployed in future
healthcare environments due to the drawbacks of RF, especially in RF sensitive areas. Additionally,
the traditional VLC systems using photodiodes as the receiver require hardware modifications and
extra set up; however, deploying a camera as the receiver does not require extra modifications to the
infrastructure, due to the inbuilt filter and focusing properties of cameras, hence the proposed system
would be beneficial in healthcare.
