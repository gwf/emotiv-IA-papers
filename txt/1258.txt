Abstract—The goal of this paper is to provide a
comprehensive overview of the coexistence nature of wireless
technologies most likely to be found in medical scenarios’
environment. The diversity and number of these technologies is
increasing constantly leading to potential interference problems
and performance degradation of wireless medical applications
which are expected to become popular in 5G systems. The
industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) bands in the 2.4 GHz are
already very crowded to the point that the location and use of
medical devices have to take into account the pervasive presence
of other wireless devices operating in that region of the
spectrum. A temporary solution is to use more the 5 GHz bands
currently not so heavily utilized. This scenario will change in the
near future as unlicensed long-term evolution (LTE) solutions
such as MulteFire start operating in those bands. This paper
provides a summary of the wireless technologies and devices
present in hospitals and other medical care scenarios. It also
provides recommendations for the rational share of the spectrum
in those scenarios.

safety of the patients and their care givers. The scope of this
paper is to survey relevant features of the wireless
technologies present in this type of scenarios, in particular
their spectrum occupancy, power levels and data rates.
Section II provides a summary of wireless technologies that
have been specifically designed for medical applications or
that are most likely to be used by medical devices. Section III

INTRODUCTION

The use of wireless communications systems has increased
considerably in hospitals and health care scenarios. A recent
report [1] estimates that the market for wireless medical
devices is expected to show about 25.1% market growth over
the next five years. The worldwide market has the potential to
expand from $3.6 billion in 2015 to about $11.0 billion by
2020. These days it is common to find in hospitals a variety of
wireless devices that monitor patients’ vital signs, that help
locate doctors, nurses, and equipment, and that are used to
communicate among care givers. Patients, their visitors, and
the hospital personnel continuously use cellular
communications and wireless local area networks (WLAN).
The presence of microwaves and wireless devices that monitor
the building environment, e.g. thermostats, lighting, also adds
to the electromagnetic radiation present in medical scenarios.
Electromagnetic compatibility or more specific coexistence
of wireless devices and other sources of electromagnetic
radiation must be carefully monitored and controlled in
hospitals and other health care environments to ensure the

ON- AND IN-BODY DEVICES/ SYSTEMS

The large majority of wireless devices used in medical
applications operate in the unlicensed bands of the spectrum,
in particular those bands that have been designated for
industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) communication
purposes. They are unlicensed but they are still regulated, e.g.
in Europe by CEPT (European Conference of Postal and
Telecommunications Administrations) [2]. Several well
established technologies, such as Bluetooth [3], ZigBee [4],
radio-frequency identification (RFID) [5] and IEEE Std.
802.11 [6] operate in the ISM bands. Some of these bands are
globally designated as being unlicensed, e.g. 2.400 GHz to
2.483 GHz with some variations from region to region. But all
bands are not common, for example in Europe the ISM 863870 MHz band is designated for SRD but it is not in the US
(the closest is the 902-928 MHz band).
In the next paragraphs a brief summary of wireless
technologies that are commonly found in medical scenarios is
presented. Most of them are on-body devices but recently
there has been an increase of in-body devices, as well as
devices used by medical device providers. The main
characteristics of the technologies described in this section is
shown in Table 1.
Bluetooth is a wireless technology that has been around for
over twenty years and has gone through several iterations,
each improving or expanding the features of the previous one.

ETSI SmartBAN [9]
ANT / ANT+ [10]

A low-power version (Bluetooth 4.0), called Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) or Bluetooth Smart was introduced in 2010. It
consumes little power and can be operated with small power
sources or by harvesting energy. It is becoming widely used
on a large variety of medical devices, e.g. heart rate and blood
pressure monitors. It operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. Its
medium access control (MAC) protocol uses 3 advertising
channels strategically positioned to minimize interference and
channel occupancy. Recent update, Bluetooth 5.0 improves
further this technology’s suitability for the Internet of Things
(IoT) applications by increasing range, speed and broadcasting
capacity.
IEEE 802.15.6 [8] and ETSI SmartBAN [9] standards are
the first ones tailored specifically for body area networks that
can be used in health, medical, and sport applications. The
IEEE Std. 802.15.6 is intended for low-power devices to be
used in wireless body area networks. This standard offers
three physical (PHY) layer options: narrowband (NB), ultrawideband (UWB) and human body communications (HBC).
The MAC layer for this standard has three different modes and
thus it offers flexibility for operation in different scenarios.
The ETSI SmartBAN standard is more recent than IEEE Std.
802.15.6. The frequency of operation of this standard is
between 2.401 GHz and 2.481 GHz with 2 MHz spacing, i.e.
similar to the classic Bluetooth. This protocol uses separate
channels for data and control messages and like the IEEE Std.
802.15.6 it has different channel access modes [9].
ANT/ANT+ [10] is low-power proprietary protocol
designed for low data rate sensor and body area networks that
can be configured in different topologies, e.g. peer-to-peer,
star, and mesh. It operates in the 2.400 – 2.524 GHz band, the
ANT+ devices operates in the 2.457 GHz frequency. The ANT
channels are 1 MHz wide. The protocol is time division
multiple access (TDMA) based with channel hopping
capabilities. The flexibility features of this protocol allow
ANT devices to adapt to hostile conditions by changing the
amount of control overhead depending on the amount of
experienced interference.
Sensium [11] is a proprietary protocol that operates in the
868 MHz and 915 MHz frequency regions. The SensiumVitals

system is designed for the monitoring of patient’s vital signs
relying on a radio chip in compliance with the IEEE Std.
802.15.6 narrowband PHY layer.
Zarlink [12] is a low-power proprietary transceiver
designed for medical implantable applications. It operates in
402 – 405 MHz and 433 – 434 MHz bands. It can operate in
both implants and in an on-body hub devices. When operating
in an implant device, the radio is in a sleep mode most of the
time and it makes use of a wake-up radio that operates in the
2.4 GHz band or it wakes up directly using a clock mechanism
within the implantable device.
BodyLAN [13] is a proprietary technology that operates in
the 2.4 GHz band. It is focused on fitness equipment and
devices but is also deployed in medical devices and consumer
electronics. It relies on transmissions of short burst durations,
very low duty-cycle, and Gaussian frequency-shift keying
(GFSK) modulation. These features minimize the interference
from IEEE Std. 802.11g orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM) / direct sequence spread spectrum
(DSSS) packets.

COMPLEMENTARY/COMPETING WIRELESS
TECHNOLOGIES

This section has a description of wireless technologies that
are likely to be found in medical scenarios. These technologies
can be complementing or enhancing the functions of the
technologies described in Section II, but in other cases they
are performing non-medical related functions, e.g. building
environmental control, occupying the same spectrum bands
used by medical devices and potentially interfering with their
performance. A brief description of several of these
technologies is given next.
The IEEE 802.11 [6] is an ever evolving set of PHY and
MAC layer standards specifications for the implementation of
WLAN communications. The original version of this standard
was released in 1997. Ever since then it has been revised
increasing the range of its features, in particular the bit rates.
When operating in the 2.4 GHz frequency bands (802.11b/g) it
runs into a lot of completion with other wireless devices and
even electric/electronic appliances, e.g. microwave ovens.

The 802.11a version of the standard operates in the 5 GHz
region avoiding the congested 2.4 GHz region. It uses 52subcarriers (OFDM) with a maximum of 54 Mbps. 802.11g
operates in the 2.4 GHz region but it uses the same type of
OFDM scheme as 802.11a and is able to provide a maximum
rate of 54 Mbps. Substantial increase in bit rates, reliability,
and throughput, are achieved with the 802.11n version. The
use of multiple antennas, an efficient MAC layer, and a wider
channel (40 MHz) allows for a theoretical maximum of 600
Mbps. 802.11n can operate in the 2.4 GHz and 5 (5.725-5.850)
GHz frequency ranges. A recent (2013) version, 802.11ac, can
provide a maximum data rate of 6.75 Gbps. It has the option to
operate on 40 MHz, 80 MHz, and 160 MHz bandwidths in the
5 GHz ISM band.
For building automation and environment conditions
monitoring, the ZigBee [4] and LoRa [14] solutions might
become common in future deployments. ZigBee is based on
IEEE Std. 802.15.4 and most of the solutions are operating at
congested 2.4 GHz band. LoRa technology is operating at subGHz bands. 3GPP group is also actively developing IoT
solutions, such as NB-IoT and LTE-M which will operate in
licensed cellular bands [15].
RFID devices are being used widely in all type of
environments, including hospitals and medical care facilities.
They use several regions of the spectrum, e.g. 135 kHz, 13.56
MHz, 2.45 GHz and 5.8 GHz. Of particular interest are the
tags that work in the 2.45 GHz and 5.8 GHz where many of
the devices used in medical scenarios are also used.
Interference of RFIDs with medical equipment has been found
to be a direct function of the distance between the tag and the
medical devices.
There are several competing proposals to bring LTE
performance to the unlicensed 5 GHz region of the spectrum
in order to increase the capacity of cellular networks. These
proposals have originated, to this date, contradictory reports

about the coexistence of LTE-U (unlicensed) and Wi-Fi
networks [16], [17]. An approach to improve the capacity is to
combine the use of unlicensed spectrum with licensed bands
(LTE License Assisted Access (LAA) and LTE - Wi-Fi link
aggregation (LWA)). There has been a flurry of proposals in
the literature aiming to improve the coexistence of LTE and
Wi-Fi networks. MulteFire is a new technology which enables
to use LTE technology solely in unlicensed band, particularly
at 5 GHz [18]. A summary of the main features of the
technologies described in this section are shown in Table 2.

COMMERCIALLY APPROVED MEDICAL DEVICES

It is useful to have an inventory of what is the current state of
the art regarding commercial devices currently in use at
medical care locations. The majority of these devices are onbody type, i.e. they are deployed on the body or within very
close proximity of the human body. In-body devices are
becoming more common but communication environment is
more challenging and it takes a longer time to have them
tested and approved, thus they are not numerous in the market.
Finally, there are on-body medical wireless devices that are
used by medical providers to assist them when carrying out
their work, e.g., drawing blood. Table 3 shows a
representative sample of commercially available wireless
medical devices. From Table 3 it is apparent that, other than
implant medical devices, the majority of the current
commercially available wireless medical devices use
Bluetooth Low Energy technology. BLE operates in the
crowded 2.4 GHz frequency bands. It is expected than many
future medical devices will operate in 5 GHz frequency bands
to improve their wireless connectivity. It should be noted that
because of health considerations not all medical devices can
operate at those frequencies not even at the 2.4 GHz, e.g.,
pacemakers.

COEXISTENCE AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Fig. 1 summarizes the locations, in the frequency
spectrum, of the common wireless technologies. It is apparent
that a large variety of technologies are using unlicensed ISM
bands, the 2.4 GHz band being the most crowded.
The majority of the commercially available state-of-the-art
on-body devices use BLE. This technology operates in the 2.4
GHz and has features that make it, to a certain degree, resilient
to interference. There are a few medical and wellness care
devices using the IEEE Std. 804.15.4 [7]. This standard has
been shown consistently, via experiments and analytical
studies, to be vulnerable to Wi-Fi in the 2.4 GHz region.
Special attention must be given to the physical location of the
sensor nodes, the frequency channels they are using, and the
location of the Wi-Fi routers.
In scenarios where devices using Bluetooth and 802.15.4
are operating in the same physical space experimental studies
have shown that Bluetooth is more vulnerable to 802.15.4 than
vice versa [19]. The most likely explanation is the higher
channel occupancy of 802.15.4. Properly control of duty
cycles and power levels of 802.15.4 devices, and Bluetooth /
BLE frequency hopping, can minimize this interference.
Recent experimental measurements at hospitals [20] show
that for the time being there is still sufficient available
spectrum in the 2.4 GHz region for the various medical
wireless devices and other wireless systems to work at their
normal levels without any intervention or control, even at peak
hours. However, the fact that the unlicensed bands in the 2.4
GHz are becoming more and more congested has led to efforts
to share those bands in a more rational way instead of reactive

ad-hoc solutions. For medical scenarios, proposals such as the
one described in [21] are worth to consider. They propose a
generic protocol stack that allows for different wireless
technologies with different higher level stacks. In simple
terms, it recognizes the presence of heterogeneous networks. It
attempts to use common features and then implements a
cognitive procedure for the layers to share information
available to each particular protocol stack. In addition, it must
be noted that recently defined spectrum slots, around the 2.4
GHz ISM band, have been designated for medical
communication in Europe (2.4835-2.5 GHz) and in the US
(2.36-2.4 GHz). These spectrum slots may play an important
role in wireless medical applications in the 2.4 GHz region.
The ISM band at 5 GHz is currently much less crowded
than the 2.4 GHz band. However, state-of-the-art Wi-Fi base
stations are now able to operate both in 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz
ISM bands and therefore more traffic is expected to appear in
the 5 GHz bands. In addition, new wireless communications
technologies such as MulteFire have been recently launched
to operate in the 5 GHz band. The use of the 5 GHz frequency
bands to extend LTE services has created new coverage
opportunities but also concerns about the coexistence of LTE
with Wi-Fi services [17]. There are reports highlighting the
negative impact of LTE on Wi-Fi, but there are also reports
concluding that such impact is very small. A more realistic
solution moving forward is that both sides of this issue, the
Wi-Fi industry and the telco operators, will have to adapt their
standards to share the spectrum in a constructive way. The use
of LTE in the 5 GHz will be go a long way in solving the
problem of continuously monitoring patients as they move
from one place to another since devices will be able to

leverage well tested LTE mobility features.
Spectrum sensing techniques developed for cognitive radio
could be used to dynamically sense the spectrum in a medical
scenario and a selection of free channel could be made.
However, this solution is not comprehensive and suitable for
time critical applications since the channel access cannot be
guaranteed. Here it is recommended that for a privately
owned environment, like hospital area, the frequency
spectrum should be managed in a centralized manner. Not
only information from dynamic spectrum sensing devices, but
also from geolocation databases should be used to aid in the
proper sharing of the spectrum. The information collected can
be processed to optimize a priority-based spectrum sharing
process in order to guarantee minimum communication
requirements of critical applications in a medical care facility.
The spectrum coordinator could for example, restrict the
bandwidth available to visitors in certain areas in order to
guarantee that the medical devices can get enough bandwidth
to meet their functions.
