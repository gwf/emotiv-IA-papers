Abstract—Fluent reading requires learning the print knowledge of alphabet symbols (letters), rapid automatic naming and
phonological awareness skills. In this study, electroencephalographic brain signals of 17 subjects were measured with an
eMotiv EPOC+ headset before, during and after a computerbased training session. For the training, distorted letter prints
were created by rotating Turkish letters 180 degrees along the
y-axis. Using these distorted letters two different texts, each
150 words in length, were created. Subjects were asked to read
these texts before and after the training session. We investigated
whether there is an improvement in reading speed and a decrease
in number of errors due to the computer-based training and
whether we can correlate the success of training with any
characteristic of any EEG brain signals. Based on our analysis of
the EEG data collected throughout the experiment, we observed
that the frequency modulation across resting states in the Theta
at the Broca Area (F7 and FC5) predicts individual reading
performance measures. Even though there exist a variety of
studies indicating a relation of Theta band power and learning
performance, EEG measurements with eMotiv EPOC+ had not
been previously reported with a Turkish alphabet learning task.
Keywords—EEG signal processing, multi sensory learning.

I NTRODUCTION

Reading, writing and arithmetic abilities are important
for academic success. University students pass many exams
throughout their school lives by the time they reach university
education. However, in spite of the fact that their IQ is normal
or above normal, some of these students, suffer from specific
learning disabilities. If the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for
Children (WISC-R) test shows there is a big discrepancy between verbal IQ and performance IQ, this may point to specific
learning disability (SLD). However, there are many specific
learning disability cases which cannot be shown by such tests
978-1-5386-1501-0/18/$31.00 c 2018 IEEE

alone [11]. The findings in the article suggest that IQ tests
are not particularly useful for determining learning disabilities.
Instead achievement (reading, arithmetic, writing) test scores
are more useful diagnostic tools. Learning to read starts with
learning the names of the alphabet symbols (rapid automatic
naming) and their related sounds (phonological awareness) [1].
The relation between an alphabet symbol and its sound should
be unique in order to retrieve the information correctly later on
when needed during reading. Reading speed is based on how
a person easily retrieves the information about the symbol and
its sound(phonics). This reading process involves both shortterm and long-term memory. Both rapid automatic naming and
phonological awareness skills have been strongly predictive of
individual differences in reading. The performance measure
for good reading is, therefore, the reading speed (number of
words read in a minute) and the number of errors made during
reading. Reading comprehension (which is to understand what
is read) develops in the brain after the reading speed reaches
a certain level and the vocabulary is extended enough, which
requires a variety of oral-language skills [2], [3]. Although IQ
is normal or above normal, 5% of people in many societies may
not perform well in reading, writing and/or arithmetic, and/or
in learning in general [4], [7]. There is a great deal of research
about specific learning disabilities in the literature which show
that specific learning disabilities are mostly developmental
[12], [13], [24]. The research conducted in this area suggests
an abnormal lateralization of prefrontal attentional control
processes [22]. This finding is in accordance with the (scarce)
evidence that reading disabilities involve a deviant structural
asymmetry of the frontal lobe [23]. The recent fMRI studies in
neurotypical adults implicate corticostriatal and hippocampal
systems in language learning [27]. In the literature, it has
been further shown that higher levels of slow brain waves in
the Broca area (F7 and FC5) in the left hemisphere have a
high correlation with linguistic learning disabilities [5], [6],
[10], [21], [25], [26]. These studies have been completed

using laboratory EEG equipment with 32 or 64 electrodes.
In our study, we measured the EEG signals of subjects with a
lightweight eMotiv EPOC+ headset with 14 electrodes before
, during and after a learning task. The Emotiv EPOC+ headset
(http://emotiv.com/) has become one of the leading pieces of
BCI equipments available today as a result of its low cost
and features, including 14 EEG channels plus two references,
inertial sensors, wireless connectivity, the ability to provide
raw EEG data as well as averaged EEG data, ease of use and
attractiveness for children and adolescents. Although its use for
research purposes is being questioned by many researchers,
several researches have demonstrated that eMotiv EPOC+
headset captures the EEG data quite accurately [?], [8], [19],
[20]. In order to collect data from many children, eMotiv
EPOC+ provides a user friendly and ergonomic interface and
can integrate with both desktop and mobile phone applications
and be used at home. In the near future, with this new
technology, it can be possible to apply neurofeedback to young
children at home without disturbing them much and without
lowering their self-esteem. Turkish is an ortographic language,
meaning that the words are read as they are written. This makes
the reading easier for many people, yet there are learning
disabilities in Turkey. There has been little research [14]–[18]
conducted about specific learning disabilities in Turkey and to
our knowledge, there is no research conducted about Turkish
language which correlates learning disabilities with EEG data.
The contribution of this paper is an experimental study that
explores neural correlates of reading abilities in Turkish based
on EEG data collected by an eMotiv EPOC+ headset. Our
experimental analysis of the collected data show that higher
slow brain waves in the Broca area (F7 and FC5) in the left
hemisphere have a high correlation with linguistic learning
disabilities.

M ATERIALS & M ETHODS

A. Subjects and Experimental data
Seventeen University students (mean age: 20.58, stddev:
2.39 ; 10 men, 7 women) are voluntarily participated in
this study. All subjects’ native language were Turkish.They
learned reading without any problem in the elementary school,
however they were naive to the alphabet formed with distorted
Turkish letters and the computer based training task. Before
the experiment, all participants gave their informed consent
after the experimental procedure was explained to them in
accordance with guidelines set by the research ethics committee. Throughout the experiments, eMotiv EPOC+ headset
is used. Internal sampling rate in the headset is 2048 per secs
per channel. The data are filtered to remove mains artefacts
then down-sampled to 128 per secs per channel. There are
14 EEG channels plus two references. Electrodes were placed
according to the 10-20 system. Before the experiments, the
calibration of the eMotiv Headset on the subject’s scalps is
done with the Xavier Control panel of eMotiv, each electrode
is made sure to transfer EEG data with high quality (see Figure
1).
B. Study Design
Participating subjects performed a letter print learning task
under simultaneous EEG recordings. The goal of the task
was learning the name of new letters which are distorted 180

electrodes.
degrees in the y-axis (See Figure 1). Before the experiments,
the EEG signals in the resting , eyes open state are measured
for each subjects for five minutes and the data is stored
in .csv files. During these recordings, subjects were placed
approximately 0.5 meters in front of a computer screen and
instructed to relax with eyes open, looking at a fixation point in
the middle of the screen. The programs are written with Python
and uses the Community SDK provided by eMotiv to communicate with eMotiv EPOC+ headset. Artefact removal and
conversion from Analog to Digital signal is done by the eMotiv standard procedures. libEDK.IEE_GetAverageBandPowers
routine is used. During the experiments EEG is recorded, and
after the experiment, another five minutes of resting, "eyes
open" state EEG signals are recorded.
C. Letter print learning task
The task involved showing distorted letters on the screen together with a picture which starts with the letter shown and the
phonics of letter (See Figure 2). Throughout the experiments,
subjects are shown 29 distorted Turkish letters, repeated three
times. In each repetition, there are slight differences in the
order of pictures and sounds which are shown on the screen.
In the first round, the picture and sound are shown at the same
time, in the second round, the picture is shown one second
before the sound, in the third round, the picture is shown one
second after the sound. This is done for addressing differences
in the cross modal attention shift characteristics of different
subjects.

distorted letters.

D. Resting-State EEG processing
For all analyses in this study, all of the 14-channel
EEG data are recorded during the experiments in Theta
(4-8 Hz), Alpha(8-12 Hz), Beta-1 (12-16 Hz), Beta-2(1625 Hz), Gamma (25-45 Hz) bands. As we have used
libEDK.IEE_GetAverageBandPowers routine, we have collected averaged and cleaned data from eMotiv EPOC+ headset
and used the session average Band powers in our calculations.
E. Measuring performance of reading speed and number of
errors
Before the experiments, subjects are asked to read a text
written with distorted letters and their voices are recorded (See
Figure 1). The following measures are calculated:

Figure 3: The text written with distorted Turkish letters.
•

The number of words read in the first minute ( pretraining)

•

The number of errors done (pre-training)

After the experiments, subjects also read another text
written with distorted letters and their voices are recorded.
The following measures are calculated.
•

The number of words read in the first minute ( posttraining)

•

The number of errors done (post-training)

analysis of data is done with SPSS, and a linear regression
model is created. The independent variable is the average of
Theta absolute powers at F7 and FC5, the dependent variable is
the difference between the correctly read words in one minute
after-training and that before training.

R ESULTS

In this research, we investigated whether there is an improvement in reading speed and a decrease in number of errors
due to the computer-based training and whether we can correlate the success of training with any characteristic of any EEG
brain signals. Based on our analysis of the EEG data collected
throughout the experiment, we observed that the frequency
modulation across resting states in the Theta at the Broca
Area (F7 and FC5) predicts individual reading performance
measures. The resting state absolute Theta brain powers at the
Broca area (F7 and FC5) before the experiment demonstrated a
high correlation (0.66) with the measured learning performance
(P<0.05) (see Figure 4). In order to conclude that a linear
regression model is created (the independent variable is the
average of Theta absolute powers at F7 and FC5, the dependent
variable is the difference between the correctly read words in
one minute after-training and that before training) in SPSS. The
output of regression model is compared with the actual data
using ANOVA. The result is statistically significant (P<0.05)
and the correlation coefficient is 0.66 (see table 1 and table 2).
In other words, the slower the brain waves measured in
the Broca area (F7 and FC5) at resting state, the less useful
the computer based training of distorted letters is for learning
performance.
IV.

C ONCLUSION

In this research, we have confirmed using eMotiv EPOC+
headset that the resting state absolute Theta brain powers at
the Broca area (F7 and FC5) determines the reading abilities.
In our future research, we will be using the results found
in this research in order to create a specific neurofeedback
protocol for enhancing reading abilities of dyslexic people
who have learning disability and we will plan to apply this
specific neurofeedback protocol on dyslexic subjects more than
20 times to see whether there will be any improvement in their
reading abilities.

The final performance score is calculated by taking the
difference between the post training performance and the pretraining performance.
F. Relation of Resting state Broca Area slow waves with Letter
Print learning performance
Resting state absolute value of Theta brain waves before
the experiment have high correlation with the level of letter
print learning performance.
G. Analysis of EEG data
During the EEG recordings , we have excluded the EEG
data which exceeded three standard deviatons of the median,
as an outlier rejection criterion as onine real time. So the data
only had the accepted data as a result of that exclusion. The
