Abstract: Forests are large-scale green space resources that may exert a positive impact on human
physiology and psychology. Forests can be divided into mixed forest and pure forest, according to
the number of dominant tree species. Pure forest offers specific advantages for the study of spatial
structure and scale. In this study, a type of pure forest (i.e., bamboo forest) was adopted as a research
object to investigate differences in the physiological and psychological responses of psychologically
pressured college students to different types of forest space. We recruited 60 participants and randomly
assigned them to three experimental groups: forest interior space (FIS), forest external space (FES)
and forest path space (FPS). All participants were asked to perform the same pre-test task but different
post-test tasks. The pre-test involved performing a pressure-inducing task, whereas the post-test
involved viewing photographs of each space type. The same indicators were measured in both the
pre- and post-test, including a β/α index from each lobe, positive emotion, negative emotion and
total mood disturbance (TMD) values, according to the profile of mood states (POMS), in addition to
spatial scale preferences obtained through a questionnaire and interviews. We analysed brain waves
and mood indicators through analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), whereby the FES group exhibited
the best physiological and psychological relaxation effect. The FPS group displayed a medium effect,
and the FIS group exhibited the worst effect. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyse
the spatial scale scores. The FPS and FES types achieved a higher spatial scale preference scores
than the FIS type. Based on a comparison of the psychophysiological results with the spatial scale
preference results, spatial structure and scale are considered to be important intrinsic factors that
influence the health effects of pure forest. The results can provide guidance for forest-related human
health activities and their management.

1. Introduction
With the development of cities and villages, the relationship between human beings and green
land is also changing. In dense urban areas, human beings are primarily exposed to small- and
medium-sized urban green spaces [1–3], while in non-urban areas, humans have the opportunity to
fully integrate into large natural green spaces. Forests are valuable large-scale green space resources
that can be divided into mixed forest and pure forest. Mixed forest consists of two or more species,
whereas pure forest consists of primarily one species. Most mixed forests are not plantations but are
formed naturally over a long period of time. In certain respects, mixed forest has advantages over pure

forest. For example, mixed forest is more effective than pure forest in improving regional microclimate,
increasing forest material reserves, and promoting material circulation and landscape diversity [4–6].
However, mixed forest is greatly inferior to pure forest in terms of economic efficiency and growth rate,
particularly in countries and regions with urgent development needs. For developing regions that must
rapidly transform their environments and increase their forest resources, pure forest is undoubtedly a
better choice. For example, China’s reforestation programme, a national effort underway since the
beginning of the last century, is 90% pure forest.
However, faced with a large amount of pure forest, many countries and regions, including China,
are further considering the scientific use of such forests. Forests are important ecological environments
and resources that provide not only ecological and economic benefits, but also important health benefits.
Many urban residents benefit from forest tourism and forest therapy activities. Studies on forest health
benefits typically focus on physiological and psychological indicators to confirm the impact of forests
on the human body [7,8].
The health benefits of forests have been confirmed by researchers, particularly with respect to
mixed forests [9–12]. In recent research on the physiological and psychological effects of forests, mixed
forest studies focus more on the effects of plant diversity and forest elements. Species within pure
forests are relatively homogenous, so there is little variation in plant diversity or elements for most
pure forest spaces, and, thus, plant diversity and forest elements may not reflect the primary inherent
causes of the health effects of pure forests [13]. However, this characteristic of pure forest facilitates
studying the effect of forest spatial structure. This study aims to investigate the health effects of pure
forest of differing spatial type and scale.
1.1. Forest Health Benefits and the Effect of Forest on Physiological and Psychological Stress
Numerous studies have shown there is a close relationship between the health benefits of forests
and human physiological and psychological responses. Studies by Lee et al. have shown that
individuals suffering from illness can strengthen their immune systems and benefit in other ways
through long-term forest therapy [14]. Chen et al. noted that short-term forest activities, such as
walking or sitting, can reduce physical and psychological stress and improve attention and cognitive
ability [9]. Hassan et al. conducted a bamboo forest activity experiment on individuals suffering from
stress, and found that these individuals exhibited signs of physiological relaxation, such as reduced
blood pressure and increased α waves (a type of brain wave that indicates relaxation), as well as signs
of psychological and emotional relaxation [15]. A large number of studies have used photographs of
forests as stimulus sources. For example, studies by Chiang et al. showed that the forest environment
had positive effects on, e.g., brain waves, emotions and attention, when participants were shown
photos of forests for 5–20 min [9,16]. In brief, previous studies have shown that the health benefits of
forests are reflected in psychological indicators, such as mood and cognition, as well as physiological
indicators, such as blood pressure, heart rate variability and brain waves.
Physiological and psychological stress is a daily health concern for today’s youth. Forest activities
or forest viewing can provide relief from stress. This study focuses on a youth population of college
students by considering psychological stress, as assessed with the profile of mood states (POMS)
questionnaire [17], and physiological stress, as assessed according to brain waves [18,19], both of which
are commonly used indicators in previous studies. There are many types of brainwave indicator, such
as single indices (θ, α, β) and index ratios (θ/β, β/α, θ/(α+β), (α+θ)/β, (α+θ)/(α+β)) [20]. This study
used the β/α index ratio (β waves are associated with alertness, while α waves are associated with
relaxation) as a brainwave indicator to describe the level of physiological stress. The β/α index has
been considered to possess good evaluation value in previous studies [21,22]. The higher the β/α is, the
more nervous the subject. Conversely, the lower the index is, the more relaxed and calm the subject. In
previous studies, the POMS questionnaire has been used to assess psychological stress [16]. One of the
questionnaire’s advantages is its easy-to-understand content. In addition, the POMS questionnaire has

multiple subscales, enabling one to assess subject emotions in multiple dimensions and then aggregate
them into “positive mood”, “negative mood” and “total mood disturbance” (TMD).
1.2. Spatial Scale Effects and Space Types of Pure Forest
A change in spatial scale causes changes in other factors in a space, such as sound, temperature
and humidity, as well as light. Watts et al. noted that sound in a landscape space is correlated with
the degree of anxiety of the perceiver [23]. Krzywicka found that people have different preferences
for sounds in landscape space [24]. The relationship between space and the human body has been
studied in the fields of environmental behaviour, architecture and landscape science, as well as in their
intersections. Scholars in the field of architecture and urban planning have found that spatial structure
influences the physiological and psychological responses of individuals in the environment through
various aspects, such as scale, stimulus approaches and location relations. Jan Gehl suggested that the
spatial structure determines function and further influences the activities of the individuals in the space.
He also noted that space is divided into centralized and dispersed space and can be understood as
centripetal and centrifugal [25]. According to Edward Hall’s theory, the three-dimensional scale of space
influences people’s feelings. Hall proposed four types of spatial distance in human communication [26].
Bryan Lawson noted that space is stimulating to the human body and that two-thirds of the human
perception of space comes from vision [27]. Such findings suggested to us that spatial scale might have
an impact on the health benefits of forest viewing.
The proportion of the dominant tree species in pure forest is typically more than 90%, so the
structure of the pure forest can be regarded as a space created by repeated individual trees, but on
different scales. This phenomenon is important and makes such forests a suitable object through which
to study the relationship between spatial scale and health benefits. In Chiang et al.’s study, forest space
was classified by location into external space, internal space and edge space. This classification scheme
was created for a mixed forest, and based on obvious biodiversity differences among the three locations.
The biodiversity within the pure forest is relatively uniform, but the spatial structure of individual
locations in the forest differs, primarily in terms of three-dimensional scale and plant density. Thus,
this paper aims to determine whether different locations (representing different spatial types and
scales) produce different physiological and psychological effects. The spatial types of pure forest can
be expressed by models. Three basic spatial types of pure forest are summarized in this study based on
the relationship between the viewer and the forest (Figure 1a–c). Forest interior space (FIS) is a space
that consists entirely of repeated dominant trees. In this space, the viewer perceives little change in
the vegetation landscape. Forest path space (FPS) is a corridor space formed in the forest for artificial
or other reasons, whereby the width of the corridor is larger than the average spacing in the forest.
The viewer in the corridor interval can feel an obvious sense of direction and guidance. Forest external
space (FES) can be understood as the space between separate patches of forest. This spacing between
patches is much larger than the average spacing within the forest, and the viewer does not feel a sense
of direction or enclosure. The three pure forest space models defined in this study are relative concepts,
rather than structures with an absolute scale.

1.3. Aims and Hypotheses
This study uses three typical pure forest spaces (FIS, FPS and FES) as stimulus sources. The aim is to
investigate differences in physiological and psychological stress, based on brain waves, emotional state
and spatial scale preference scores, as they correspond to the different pure forest spaces. Subsequently,
the relationship between the two aspects is discussed. Considering previous studies and other
greenbelt-related research, we propose the following hypotheses.
Hypothesis 1 (H1). FPS may produce better physiological and psychological responses, including emotional
states and brain waves, followed by FIS. The worst responses are produced by FES.
Hypothesis 2 (H2). In terms of spatial scale, FPS and FIS may be more popular than FES.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Stimuli Selection
There are many types of pure forest and it is impossible to study all types simultaneously, so this
experiment focuses on the bamboo forest. The bamboo forest is a type of pure forest widely found in
China. China has a long history of planting bamboo, and the Chinese are familiar with bamboo forests.
According to the previous classification basis and our field survey, bamboo forest space can be divided
into three categories: forest interior space (FIS), forest external space (FES) and forest path space (FPS)
(Figure 2a–c). The three spaces are distinguished based on their location in the forest and have obvious
difference in spatial scale. However, in actual situations, the bamboo forest is continuous, and the
spatial type is gradually transitive. The space in a transitional zone may exhibit characteristics of two
types of space simultaneously. In the sample selection, we avoid this type of space to ensure that each
type is distinct from the others. No people appear in the sample photographs, which represent the
pure forest space in nature.
In this study, space samples were created using photography. The act of viewing photographs
has been shown to produce brain wave responses, and such responses to photographs as stimulus
sources have been used as emotional indicators in many studies [7,18]. To assemble a diverse set of
samples, we photographed 15 bamboo forest areas in four provinces (Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan
and Guizhou) in Southwest China. Approximately 100–150 original photos were taken of each space
type and ranked according to quality, representativeness and objectivity. Ultimately, 30 photographs
were selected for each type to form 3 groups of 90 photographs in total. All photos were taken on
sunny days with the same equipment and shooting parameters, including aperture and shutter speed.

2.3.2. Psychological Stress
This study assessed psychological stress by measuring mood state. Mood state was measured
using a Chinese version of the POMS adapted from Z. Beili [17]. The POMS consists of seven mood
subscales: tension, anger, depression, fatigue, vitality, confusion and self-esteem. The POMS has 40
questions, and each subscale includes 6–7 questions on mood states. Each question was answered on
a five-point scale ranging from 0 (none at all) to 4 (a lot). Three indicators were used in the analysis:

2.3.3. Spatial Scale Score
The spatial scale represents an impression for humans. It includes not only the overall subjective
feeling, but also several major specific scale indicators. To evaluate such matters, a spatial scale
questionnaire and interviews were adopted. According to previous theories, the three-dimensional
scale and density of a space have an important impact on feelings. Therefore, we adopted a spatial scale

4. Discussion
4.1. Does Bamboo Forest Space Affect Physiological and Psychological Stress?
There were significant differences between the pre-test and post-test values of certain physiological
and psychological indicators. As we have noted, there is little difference in plant diversity between
different locations in pure forest. Thus, obviously, the differences between the physiological and
psychological indicators have little relationship with plant diversity. At the same time, the spatial
structure of pure forests represents an important intrinsic factor that affects physiological and
psychological responses and, thus, reflects the health benefits of the pure forest. Related theories of
spatial structure note that people have the ability to perceive space and that different factors of the
spatial structure, such as scale and shape, influence emotion and behaviour [26,27]. Jan Gehl proposed
that people have a “sense of place”, which is a physical and mental pleasure that originates in feelings
regarding spatial elements [25]. Therefore, one can speculate that among the three types of space
considered in this study, certain spaces would be better able to stimulate the “sense of place” of stressed
youth and, thus, evoke better physiological and psychological responses.
In a study on forest location by Jiang et al., FIS was considered the most favourable based on
biological diversity and the human preference for tall plants [33,34]. Additionally, numerous studies
have shown that forest walking can create a sense of relaxation [35–37]. Based on previous research
results, we expected the best physiological and psychological relaxation effect from FPS. Obviously,
the results of this study differ from our expectations. Among all the significant results, FES performed
the best, FIS produced the highest stress in the significant EEG results, and FPS exhibited the worst
performance based on the significant positive mood results. We speculate that the key structural factors
of pure forest space that influence psychophysiological stress are “spatial diversity” and “degree of
enclosure”. The difference between FPS and FIS lies in the path, and the same point presents a close
sense of enclosure in the spatial structure. FES is a completely different type. Compared with the other
two types of space, viewers of FES have a wider field of vision and can see more sky, as well as receive

Forests 2020, 11, 616

10 of 15

an overall view of the bamboo forest. The pure forest is characterized by a single variety of plant in FIS
and FPS. Viewers who gaze at relatively monotonous landscapes may feel bored, which may further
trigger negative mood and physiological stress. FES has background and foreground elements and
colour mixing, so it is not monotonous in spatial colour and form. Thus, it is superior to the other two
space types in terms of “spatial diversity” and has a lower “degree of enclosure”.
Previous studies on the mixed forest have suggested that forest interior space with higher
biodiversity and a dense plant landscape may provide better health benefits [16,38]. These results
support our conjecture that the intrinsic reasons for the psychophysiological responses to the pure
forest and the mixed forest are different. Plant diversity is not the key factor in the pure forest,
and different spatial structures are an important reason for the noted difference. FES has a more
favourable spatial structure than FIS and FPS, with a larger field of vision, richer landscape and
moderate green proportion.
4.2. Are There Differences in the Spatial Scale Evaluation of Bamboo Forest Spaces?
Subjective feelings form one part of the spatial scale evaluation. We extracted generic information
from the interviewees, such as “I prefer the ease of the bamboo trails”, “The inner space of the
bamboo forest has a sense of limitation”, “The internal space of the bamboo forest is more chaotic
and depressing”, “The external view is more comfortable and tidy” and “I like the orderly bamboo
landscape”. Based on the information gathered in the interviews, we believe that the key factors related
to the spatial scale preference for bamboo forests are “visibility” and “tidiness”. This finding differs
from previous research suggesting that people prefer to be surrounded by green forests and to be close
to nature [39,40]. In this study, due to high density and a lack of management, FIS tended to cause a
sense of clutter and depression, which resulted in the lowest evaluation among our subjects. Although
FPS is a special type of FIS, the bamboo on both sides of the path is typically straight and orderly,
shielding the unfavourable aspects of the forest. However, forward vision is not obstructed in FPS,
and “visibility” is better. Therefore, the subjects produced a median evaluation for FPS. FES offers
a more complete and broad view than the other two types of space. In addition, a forest landscape
viewed from the outside is typically more orderly. Thus, FES received the highest evaluation among
our subjects.
When we compared the spatial scale score and the interview information, we found that the
two were consistent. FPS received the highest score for “distance”, which suggests that FPS has
good “visibility” in the front and is consistent with the “relaxed feeling on the path” noted in the
interviews. FES received the highest score for “width”, which indicates that the horizontal view is not
constrained, which reflects the statements in the interviews to the effect that the “external view is more
comfortable”. However, FIS received a lower score for each item, particularly for “density”, which
reflects the density of FIS in three-dimensional space and recalls the participants’ view that “internal
space is more chaotic and depressing”. In short, the spatial scale scores were basically consistent with
the interview information, and they jointly reflect the subjective feelings of the stressed youth towards
the bamboo forest space. FES and FPS were more highly preferred than FIS, because of the longer and
wider field of view and the moderate density and the regularity of plants.
The three types of bamboo forest considered in this study have different three-dimensional indices
and densities. Both the questionnaire scores and the interviews indicate that the subjects evaluated the
spatial scales of bamboo forest differently. Generally, they had the highest spatial preference for FES,
which also had the most relaxing physiological and psychological effect. FPS was in the middle, and FIS
was the worst in both aspects. The psychophysiological indices and spatial preferences were basically
consistent, which suggests that the spatial structure and the scale of pure forest are the underlying
reasons for their health benefits.

4.3. Limitations and Future Research
This study investigated the different psychophysiological effects of three types of bamboo forest
space on youth under pressure, and the spatial scale evaluation these types of space received. It should
be acknowledged that the potential conditions or psychological state of individuals may have some
impact on the results of the study, which should be verified with a larger population in the future. Other
types of pure forest and other populations would be worthwhile studying. Additionally, future studies
could examine more spatial structure indicators, such as spacing, crown width and tree diameter at
breast height, and quantify these indicators with further elaboration of the effects of different spatial
scales of the pure forest. This study also compared the spatial scale results with the results for the
psychophysiological indicators and discussed the intrinsic causes of the health effects of the pure
forest, whereby certain results differed from those found in previous studies on the mixed forest. We
conclude that these differences are caused by differences in spatial characteristics between the pure and
mixed forest. However, there is a lack of comparative evidence for these two forest types. In future
research, we will further study the differences in space and health benefits between the pure forest and
mixed forest.
4.4. Application
This study shows that an appropriate spatial structure and scale are highly important to the health
benefits of pure forest. The external spatial landscape and path landscape of the bamboo forest are
conducive to physical and psychological relaxation, and received higher evaluations with respect to
spatial scale. Therefore, in the regional planning of bamboo forests, targeted tourism layouts can be
designed, such as by assigning the tourism function to the external areas of the forest and consigning
forestry production to the forest’s interior. In addition, the rationality of the spatial structure of pure
forest is an important factor that affects physiology and psychology. In the construction of a bamboo
forest landscape, higher, larger and more orderly plants, wider vistas and medium density could
improve the health benefits of the landscape.
5. Conclusions
The health benefits of large-scale forest green space require more in-depth research and scientific
examination. This study focused on the effect of a pure forest space (bamboo forest) on physiological
and psychological responses and spatial scale preferences. We used photographs of three spatial types of
bamboo forest (i.e., FES, FPS, FIS) as stimuli, to analyse the differences among the psychophysiological
indicators. We administered a spatial scale questionnaire to, and conducted interviews with, three
subject groups. The results revealed that FES performed best in the area of physiological and
psychological relaxation, followed by FPS and finally FIS. However, the spatial scale scores and
evaluations for FES and FPS were higher than for FIS. The psychophysiological indicators were
basically consistent with the spatial scale preferences, so we believe that the nature of the spatial
structure is an important intrinsic reason for the difference. This study has practical value for the
spatial layout of bamboo forest scenic spots and the construction of bamboo forest landscapes, and can
provide guidance for pure forest management and forest therapy.
