ABSTRACT
Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from test subjects are used for BCI analysis and classification of
the four upper limb movements. Brain computer interface (BCI) system provides better neural control to
the user, over two antebrachium and two carpus movement. This paper uses Epoc Emotiv head set with
fourteen electrodes to acquire signal from the motor area of scalp. A particular protocol for data
acquisition is followed. Our method is based on the time domain feature extraction techniques. Activity
feature is applied on the signals. In order to discriminate between four upper limb movements within
the data set, the paper uses Quadratic support vector machine, RBF SVM and Multilayer perceptron. The
best classification accuracy of two antebrachium and two carpus movement is achieved by Quadratic
SVM and RBF SVM when Gaussian window is used to calculate the activity feature vector. The number
of correctly classified instants in term of percentage is 76.92% and 75.96% for quadratic SVM and RBF
SVM. Current classifiers show promising results, where as to make conclusion more generalized and to
enhance the classification accuracy, further experiments need to be carried out.
Keywords: Classification, Multilayer perceptron, Support Vector Machine, Hjorth Parameters.

Introduction

Brain Computer Interface provides us with a communication facility to actuate device using
electroencephalographic signals. Currently, BCI is used to deliver commands to the processor, which
transforms commands into certain specified actions. It‚Äôs an emerging, fast-growing technology and is
being used now a day for numerous controlling purposes. In this paper, experimental setup uses
emotive headset for the collection of EEG data [8]. The main advantage of using emotive headset is that
it is not only a noninvasive BCI technique to collect EEG data, but also provides better portability with
fourteen active electrodes. A clinical survey showed that most of the causalities or strokes results in the
disability of the people. Such a type of disability can be addressed either by restoring motor function of

Data acquisition and offline analysis are supported by Department of Mechatronics Engineering (College of
Electrical & Mechanical Engineering) National University of Sciences & Technology Pakistan. The research is carried
out under the supervision of Javaid Iqbal and Mohsin I. Tiwana. This publication only reflects the author s‚Äô views.

patients, or by providing them a prosthetic device [1]. Currently, evoked potential in combining with the
robotic feedback is a sound technique to address the motor disability of the people [1]. Most important
and recent research applications of BCI are controlling smart home appliances [2], wheel chair control,
mobile robot control, controlling a prosthetic robotic arm, etc. [3] ‚Äì [7].
This paper will classify the offline EEG data for two carpus and two antebrachium movements. Extensive
literature review is carried out to classify upper limb movement from EEG data using different protocols
and experimental setups. Table 1 shows brief survey of classification and feature extraction techniques
which have been used to classify the different upper limb movements.
Table 1: Literature Review

This paper focuses on the noninvasive BCI technique, in which the EEG data is collected from a test
subject using Emotive head set equipped with fourteen active electrodes. Data is recorded for each
particular action for eight seconds. Once the data is recorded, fourth order Butterworth filter is applied
for removal of unwanted artifacts and noise from the data set. For further rejection of undesired
artifacts and to make the data unique to achieve the better classification of carpus-up, carpus-down,
antebrachium-up, and antebrachium-down movements, it is a better practice to use windowing on data
set for processing. Further, this paper uses supervised learning classification techniques (the quadratic

SVM, radial based SVM and Multi-layer perceptron) to classify four upper limb movements when activity
(hjorth feature) is used as a feature extraction technique. Figure 1 shows schematic diagram for the
whole process.

2 Experimental Protocol and Data Acquisition
An experimental protocol has been design to acquire the data for offline analysis. Two right handed
subjects (age 25 and 26) participates in the data acquisition experimentation. Both subjects are
neurologically stable and physically healthy. The experimental protocol consists of four right handed
tasks (antebrachium-upward movement, antebrachium-downward movement, carpus-upward
movement and carpus-downward movement). The subjects are instructed to avoid any facial expression
or eye flickering in order to avoid unwanted artifacts while performing the tasks. Thirty trials with 1051
samples in 8.29 seconds are recorded from each test subject. The data from each test subject is
recorded in a single trial whereas initial data set for a particular move is separated by markers. Mode of
protocol used was P300.

Emotiv Epoc neurohead set was used to acquire EEG data from the test subjects. These days, the
research society uses EEG technology to classify and accomplish different tasks due to its prominent
advantages over other technology as discussed in the Table 2.

By using Emotiv headset, data is recorded as per designed protocol. This EEG headset is equipped with
14 active electrodes use to acquire evoked potential from scalp. The sequential sampling rate of data is
2048 Hz and then the device down sample the data at 128Hz. Finally, the incoming data is filtered by
fifth order sinc notch filter. Table 3 discusses the necessary specifications of Emotiv headset and figure 2

3 Filtration and Windowing
Once the data is acquired, it is band pass filtered (0.4-128 Hz) with 500 Hz sampling frequency and fifth
order butter worth filter (48Hz ‚Äì 52Hz) is used to clip the baseline noise. In BCI, the aim of filtration is to
remove the unwanted artifacts recorded during data acquisition [13]. After filtration, a better practice to
extract the feature is to make a window on the data set. The size of window should be carefully selected

because larger window can accommodate outlier while calculating the feature and much smaller
window can lose confidence. In this paper, the window applied on the data set is of 52X1 with 0.1 sec
step size [13]. Two different types of windows (Gaussian window and Chebyshev window) were applied
on the data set for analysis as shown in the figure 3.

Standard deviation. And Chebyshev window of 52 samples with side lobe magnitude r = 9

4 Feature Translation
A Time domain feature extraction technique, Activity (also known as one of the hjorth features) is used
for the reduction of artifacts. Different artifacts removal techniques are used by various authors as
mentioned in the Table no. 1. In BCI, the aim of feature extraction is to remove the unwanted artifacts
recorded during data acquisition [10] like eye blinking, other unwanted muscular activity and etc.

xi represents the signal, xi‚Ä≤ is the rate of change of signals and y(xi) is the measure of signal‚Äôs mean
frequency. A hjorth approach, activity is also used in this paper to find the attributes. Mathematically it
can be represented as.

Xn is nth number of sample in the data set and is the mean and N be the total number of samples.
Activity calculates that how much signal is deviated from its mean value. The topographical distribution
of feature vector is shown in the figure4. There are different frequency domain methods for calculating
the feature vector like PSD, BP, wavelet, Fourier, AR and etc. but they have complex parameters and
causes to enhance over fitting difficulties while classifying dat.

5 Classification Techniques
Once feature vector have calculated now classify the data depending upon the feature. This paper used
one against one technique for RBF support vector machine and quadratic SVM to classify the four upper
limb movements by constructing a nonlinear hyper plane in feature space. Mathematically support
vector machine is represented by following equation.

ùë†ùëñ is support vector, ùëéùëñ is weight and b is the bias that is used to classify the feature vector x. Here k is

r is the quadratic function parameter needed to be selected carefully for better classification. The
classification accuracy of upper limb movement using support vector machine is shown in [12] and [14].
While [11] uses cascading of SVM with hidden markov model to classify the forearm movement.
Another paradigm used to classify the two antebrachium and two carpus movement used in this paper is
multi-layer perceptron. Its formulation is as follows.
ùë¶ = ùëì(ùëé)(‚àëùëòùëñ=1(ùë§ùëñ ùë•ùëñ + ùëë))

f(a) is the activation function, d is the bias, w is the weight and x is the feature vector. Using BCI
competition IV, A dataset for three motor imageries (left hand, right hand and right foot), multilayer
perceptron shows 85.71% classification accuracy with 0.1 learning rate [16].

6 Results and Discussion
The overall classification rates of above mentioned classifier with activity as a feature are shown in the
table 4. Based on the literature survey, analysis, and results obtained, it can be concluded that Quadratic
support vector machine and radial based function support vector machine give the best classification
accuracy of 76.92% and 75.96% when Gaussian window of 0.1 millisecond is used to find the activity
feature vector. The analysis of Quadratic support vector machine and RBF SVM for the classification of
four upper limb movement using activity (hjorth feature) presented in this paper is novel. Whereas
better classification of antebrachium downward movement, antebrachium upward movement, Carpus
downward movement and carpus upward movement is 92.31%, 80.70%, 63.00% and 80.70%,
respectively, using activity with quadratic SVM. RBF SVM and quadratic SVM with activity feature shows
much better results (shown in the table4) as compared to the SVM with principal component analysis,
power spectral density, Multi-CSP Multi GECSP and Multi-sTRCSP used as the feature extraction
techniques. whereas literature survey reports the classification accuracy of upper limb movement using
SVM with principal component analysis [11], power spectral density [14], Multi-CSP [12], Multi GECSP
[12] and Multi-sTRCSP [12] is 78.15%, 64.00%, 70.07%, 68.73% and 70.43% respectively. Table 4
expresses the classification accuracy of three classifiers. Best classification accuracy of multilayer
perceptron is 72.06% when Gaussian window is used for calculating activity feature vector. By applying
Chebyshev window it is found that MLP shows 70.43% correctly classified instants. Figure 4 shows the
topographical distribution of four upper limb movements. In figure 4 the red area shows convergence of
the data over the left hemisphere of frontal lobe of motor cortex, the maps are made based on the
activity (hjorth value) values of each electrode.

Table 5 shows stratified cross validation results and weighted average accuracy of multilayer
perceptron. These results shows some deviation and this may be due to the reason that if the size of
classes differs it causes misclassification and the number of false positives increases .This research has
great importance, due to the reason that one can understand that how specific neural activity is differ
from the other motor area. In order to enhance true positive and make the solution more generic it is
necessary to increase number of trials by increasing number of test subjects.

7 Conclusion
The current BCI research is focused on the optimization of classifier algorithms and better neural
plasticity. In this study, the performance of Quadratic support vector machine, RBF support vector
machine and Multilayer Perceptron using activity feature for the optimized classification of
antebrachium upward-movement, antebrachium-downward movement, carpus-downward movement
and carpus-upward movement has been investigated and analyzed. In this analysis, the best results
achieved by Quadratic SVM and RBF SVM classifiers are 76.92% and 75.96% when activity is used as
feature. Future work is aimed at enhancing the performance of algorithm to attain better classification
results and to make the solution more generic by enhancing the number of data samples and number of
test subjects.
