A brain–machine interface (BMI) allows for direct communication between the brain and machines. Neural probes for recording
neural signals are among the essential components of a BMI system. In this report, we review research regarding implantable neural
probes and their applications to BMIs. We first discuss conventional neural probes such as the tetrode, Utah array, Michigan probe,
and electroencephalography (ECoG), following which we cover advancements in next-generation neural probes. These next-generation probes are associated with improvements in electrical properties, mechanical durability, biocompatibility, and offer a high degree of freedom in practical settings. Specifically, we focus on three key topics: (1) novel implantable neural probes that decrease the
level of invasiveness without sacrificing performance, (2) multi-modal neural probes that measure both electrical and optical signals,
(3) and neural probes developed using advanced materials. Because safety and precision are critical for practical applications of BMI
systems, future studies should aim to enhance these properties when developing next-generation neural probes.

attention for their promising applications in medical, industrial,
and household settings [3-6].
In a unidirectional BMI, the system consists of three components: devices used to record neural signals, components used
to analyze the signals, and devices used to provide commands to
operate the machine, as illustrated in Fig. 1. In a bidirectional BMI,
additional components are required to provide feedback from the
machine to the brain [7, 8]. While both invasive and non-invasive
methods have been developed for the acquisition of neural signals,
the present review focuses on implantable neural probes. Thus,
hereafter, we will use the terms “neural probes” and “invasive meth-

First one is the system that acquires neural signal, for example, neural recording systems with a neural probe. Second one is decoding component
to translate neural activities into machine operational languages. Third one is encoding component that analyze feedback data from sensors and stimulate the specific regions in the brain.

ods” interchangeably.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely utilized in non-invasive
BMI systems due to its high temporal resolution, which makes it
useful for mapping associations between EEG signals and cognitive function [9-11]. For example, NeuroSky, Inc. (San Jose, CA,
USA) introduced an EEG-based brain–medicine interfacing
headset for use in healthcare settings. In addition, Emotiv, Inc. (San
Francisco, CA, United Sates) provides a 14-channel system for
measuring EEG and other bio-signals for use in brain–computer
interfacing games and neurofeedback treatment. Functional nearinfrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and magnetoencephalography
(MEG) have also been used to develop non-invasive BMI systems
[12-15]. However, non-invasive neural methods are limited in
that neural signals from non-invasive probes are typically insufficient for complicated tasks that require a high degree of freedom,
such as robot control [16-19]. For this reason, implantable neural
probes are preferred for BMI systems that demand accurate controls and adjustments (e.g., neuroprosthetic devices).
Implantable neural probes are defined as devices implanted into

the brain or other nervous tissues. Communication between neurons in the brain occurs via electrical and chemical signals. In most
cases, electrical signals are the main source of information in BMI
systems. In particular, single-unit activity (i.e., spikes) is regarded
as most appropriate for extracting meaningful information, such
as movement-related activity [20]. While non-invasive methods
record neural activity through different media such as the dura
matter, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), and skull, implanted neural
probes can record extracellular activity or local field potentials
closer to neurons. To maximize the signal-to-noise ratio, the conductive material is often exposed at the end of the electrode, the
shank of which is insulated with non-conductive material. Typically, single-wire electrodes [21] and glass micropipette electrodes
are used in electrophysiological studies [22, 23]. Recent advancements have enabled the development of implantable neural probes
with the technical characteristics necessary for practical BMI
applications, which include high spatiotemporal resolution and
high signal-to-noise ratio. Biocompatibility, biochemical stability,
and miniaturization are also important, as neural probes must be

inserted into the brain. Indeed, implantable multi-array neural
probes with these characteristics have been developed and applied
for research, diagnosis, and treatment purposes. Representative
neural probes in this category include the tetrode, Utah array, and
Michigan probe.
In the present report, we review the features of these three implantable neural probes and their applications in BMI systems.
Furthermore, we describe several novel technical approaches for
improving the measurement of neural signals in BMI systems: (1)
decreasing the invasiveness of implantable neural probes while
maintaining performance, (2) using multi-modal probes to measure both electrical and optical signals from neurons, and (3) using
flexible neural probes to enhance signal quality and biocompatibility. We further discuss (4) novel fabrication techniques and materials that can be utilized to improve neural probes. By exploring
recent developments in implantable neural probe technology, we
offer insight into the performance required to create practical, efficient, and accurate BMI systems.
APPLICATION OF IMPLANTABLE NEURAL PROBES IN BMIs

BMIs have been successfully applied in the field of neuroprosthetics, enabling patients with paralysis to control robot arms
using their thoughts. The underlying neural principle of this
phenomenon involves population vectors, in which each neuron
“votes” for the intended movement [20]. Increasing the number
of neuronal signals increases the likelihood of movement in the
population vector. Thus, probes including a high number of channels are suitable for BMIs. In this section, we discuss three popular

implantable neural probes with high numbers of channels.
TETRODE

The tetrode is widely utilized to record extracellular electrical potentials in neural systems. As the prefix (tetr-) indicates, the tetrode
consists of four electrodes at which neuronal signals are detected
from slightly different spatial points originating from the same
source. Such electrodes are typically constructed from a platinum–
tungsten alloy and insulated with quartz coating. The metal end of
the electrode is exposed to acquire electrical signals. The diameter
of each electrode at the metal end is usually less than 30 μm, and
may be up to100 μm at the coated end. The coating functions to
minimize the interference of electrophysiological signals across
electrodes. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, a single tetrode can measure
the extracellular potentials of approximately 1,100 neurons within
a 140-μm radius in the rat cortex [24-26]. One main advantage of
this method over single-channel electrodes is that users can classify the extracellular potentials of adjacent neurons using a clustering approach [27-29]. The extracellular potentials of each neuron
are detected by the four electrodes in the tetrode with different
temporal points and waveforms because due to the difference in
spatial distance between each electrode and the neuron. Spikes
from multiple neurons can thus be separated in the post-processing
stage. However, the tetrode cannot provide direct measurements
of spatially multi-dimensional extracellular potential distributions
unless multiple tetrodes are precisely implanted and arranged at
regular intervals. Recently, several research groups have developed
multi-tetrode arrays to compensate for these shortcomings [30,

31].
The tetrode has been used as an implantable neural probe in
BMI platforms, especially in small animals. Giszter et al. described
a neurorobotic platform, which consisted of a tetrode-based
neural recording module and a three-dimensional (3D) robotic
module, for use with spinal or cortical prosthetics in small animals
(i.e., frogs and rats) [32]. Song et al. developed a novel BMI system
to identify movement-related information in the rat cortex during
treadmill walking [33]. Using decoded neural activity acquired
from six implanted tetrodes, specific regions related to proximal
limb and trunk movements were identified in the rat motor cortex. In a follow-up study, Song and Giszter introduced a pelvis-

attached robot that can be controlled by cortical neural signals
using a multi-tetrode array implanted in the rat brain (Fig. 2B) [34].
Bender et al. investigated that activity of central complex neurons
in the insect brain during walking using a tetrode-based system
[35]. The authors reported a close association between movements and sensory responses, providing insight into the feasibility
of such methods for use in larger animals with more developed
brains. Additional groups have also reported advancements in
post-processing techniques that enable sorting of spikes in practical BMI systems. For example, Oweiss introduced a novel spatiotemporal signal processing method to improve data compression
and reduce latency in multi-tetrode BMI systems [36]. Kubo et

walking of a spine-injured non-human primate. The re-use of this figure published in [41] was permitted by Nature Publishing Group (Springer Nature).

al. further investigated the 3D distributions of neurons based on
multi-site neural activity using the tetrode [37].
UTAH ARRAY

Advancements in semiconductor fabrication processes during the late 20th century have led to the development of multichannel arrays that perform better than single-channel electrodes
in multiple respects. The Utah array is a commercially available
intracortical electrode array consisting of up to 100 silicon needleshaped electrodes, which are produced via microscale fabrication
techniques such as thermomigration, a combination of mechanical and chemical micromachining, metal deposition, and encapsulation with a polymer made of imide monomers [38]. Due to
the large number of electrodes, the Utah array has been mostly
used in large animals, especially non-human primates (Fig. 3A).
Velliste et al. investigated the ability of a BMI system to provide
neuroprosthetic arm control via cortical motor activity in rhesus
monkeys (Macaca mulatta ) using Utah arrays [39]. In this study,
the BMI system produced natural levels of multi-dimensional
arm and hand movements. In addition, the same research group
reported meaningful associations between visuomotor adaptation
and neural activity in the primary motor cortex measured via the
Utah arrays [40]. Capogrosso et al. developed a BMI platform to
electrically stimulate the spinal cord according to decoded neural
signals from the Utah array in the motor cortex of monkeys [41].
As described in Fig. 3B, the brain–spine interface enabled monkeys with spinal cord injuries to walk again based on commands
from the motor cortex. Utah arrays have not only been used for
recording, but also for stimulation purposes. For example, Tabot
et al. induced tactile sensations in the hand via targeted neural
stimulation with Utah arrays implanted in the somatosensory cortex, as illustrated in Fig. 3C [42, 43]. This type of sensory feedback
may aid in increasing the accuracy of various BMI devices and
neuro-rehabilitation instruments. In addition, Suner et al. verified
the reliability of chronic implementations of the Utah array in the
brains of non-human primates [44].
The Utah array and its recording systems have been approved
for clinical applications by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Several clinical trials of Utah array-based
BMI systems involving human patients have been conducted.
Simeral et al. reported that one patient with tetraplegia could
control a computer cursor (including point-and-click functions)
based on neural signals from the motor cortex [45]. Pandarinath
et al. analyzed neural population dynamics during movement in
two patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) as they attempted to use their finger to move a computer cursor [46]. One

year after implantation, the system still produced adequate signals
for neural cursor control (Fig. 3D) [47] or virtual typing [48]. A
more challenging task was performed by a human subject with
Utah array implantation. Wodlinger et al. developed a BMI system
for the control of an anthropomorphic robot arm and hand with
10 degrees of freedom [49]. Some studies have also indicated that
BMI systems can bypass the spinal cord circuit to recover hand
function in select patients. Bouton et al. introduced a platform for
controlling a neuromuscular electrical stimulation sleeve using
neural signals from an implanted Utah array, enabling the patient
to perform accurate and continuous movements (e.g., grasp-pourand-stir tasks) [50]. Ajiboye et al. developed an interfacing platform between intracortical neural signals recorded by two Utah
arrays and functional electrical stimulation of peripheral muscles
to restore arm and hand movements in patients with paralysis [51].
As experiments of tactile feedbacks has been successful in nonhuman primate, this type of research has begun to be applied to
human subject. As tactile feedback experiments using Utah arrays
have been successful in non-human primates, researchers have begun to apply such systems in human patients. For example, Flesher
et al. stimulated the somatosensory cortex using Utah arrays to
recover tactile sensation in human patients [52].
MICHIGAN PROBE

The previous two neural probes enable users to acquire neural
activity from different cortical areas. However, they are limited in
their ability to target deep neural structures in the axial direction
[53, 54]. In the late 1970s, the first prototype of Michigan probe,
a multi-channel depth electrode prototype, was developed based
on electron-beam lithographic techniques [55], which was before
production of Utah array. Several preclinical studies involving
small animals have demonstrated the safety of long-term implantation for the Michigan probe, suggesting that such probes can be
utilized in BMI systems [56-58]. Electrodes in the Michigan probe
(2 to 15 mm) are longer than those in the Utah array (0.5 to 1.5
mm for research). Thus, the Michigan probe may be more suitable
when recording from deeper cortical structures.
Vetter et al. applied the Michigan probe to examine extracellular
neural activity in the motor cortex of rats using a BMI system [56].
In a preclinical study on the control of emotions and memories,
the Michigan probe was used to measure neural activity and provide electrical stimulation. Frost et al. investigated neural activity in
the hindlimbs of rats with spinal cord injuries using a 16-channel
Michigan probe and explored treatment methods based on neurostimulation [59]. Guggenmos et al. investigated the use of a neural
interfacing system to recover neural function after brain injuries

in small animals (i.e., rats) demonstrating that the missing brain
functions can be restored using a brain–machine–brain interface
as described in Fig. 4 [60]. Such findings suggest that neuroprosthetics can successfully applied in the treatment of various neural
diseases. Michigan probes have also been validated in non-human
primates [61], supporting the notion that such probes can be used
to develop neuroprosthetic systems for use in humans.
RECENT ADVANCES IN NEURAL PROBES FOR IMPROVEMENTS OF BMI SYSTEMS

In the previous session, we described the most widely used
implantable neural probes in BMI applications. While the electrical characteristics, biological compatibility, and stability of these
probes are sufficient, researchers have attempted to improve their
impedance, flexibility, wireless communication, recording area,
and accuracy to ultimately improve BMI systems. In this section,
we present an overview of recent studies that have responded to
these technical challenges for practical BMI applications.

DEGREE OF INVASIVENESS AND MAINTAINING PERFORMANCE
High-performance ECoG electrode

Electrocorticography (ECoG) is used to monitor signals from

the cerebral cortex using electrodes placed on the surface of the
brain (subdural) or dura matter (epidural). In contrast to implanted neural probes, which rely on single-unit activity, ECoG relies
on local field potentials (LFPs). Although a craniotomy is still required to implement ECoG, no brain scarring occurs because the
ECoG electrodes are not inserted into the brain tissue. ECoG provides more accurate neural signals than non-invasive approaches
because due to direct (subdural) or close (epidural) contact with
brain tissue. Since ECoG has clear advantages in terms of neural
signal quality when compared with current non-invasive methods,
it is widely used in the development of minimally invasive BMI
systems [62-65]. Neural responses can be recorded from multiple
sites in the human brain with high spatiotemporal resolution following tactile stimulation, supporting the use of ECoG in medical
BMI applications [66]. For example, Wang et al. recorded activity in
the human motor cortex during individual finger movement using
micro-ECoG electrodes [67]. Subsequent studies demonstrated
that a 32-channel ECoG electrode grid could be used to record
LFPs in the sensorimotor cortex of a participant with tetraplegia
[68]. Shin et al. introduced method for decoding muscle activation
from neural activity based on ECoG signals in the motor cortex
of non-human primates [69]. In this study, they investigated the
potential for several advanced ECoG electrodes for use as neural
probes in BMI systems.
Microfabrication techniques have been employed to develop
https://doi.org/10.5607/en.2018.27.6.453

Implantable Neural Probes for BMI

high-resolution ECoG electrodes. Rubehn et al. developed a flexible, high-resolution (252 channels) ECoG electrode array to measure neural activity in the human brain by optimizing designs and
implementing high-resolution MEMS fabrication techniques [70].
Henle et al. developed a microscale ECoG electrode array using a
laser-based high-speed and high-resolution fabrication method
[71]. Due to their biocompatibility, these types of electrode arrays
are promising for use in various long-term, in vivo BMI applications. Toda et al. developed a mesh-type multi-channel ECoG electrode array with narrow spacing by simplifying fabrication steps,
including oxygen plasma etching [72]. In a preliminary in vivo
study, the authors measured neural signals in the rat visual cortex,
reporting that ocular selectivity could be predicted with 90% accuracy by decoding the neural signals from their ECoG electrode
array. Several research groups have proposed novel and optimized
strategies for ECoG electrode arrangement. Slutzky et al. optimized the spacing of each ECoG electrode to reduce invasiveness
in ECoG-based BMI systems without sacrificing performance
using finite element modeling of the electrical and physical properties of each component (i.e., scalp, skull, etc.) in the brain [73].
Tolstosheeva et al. investigated the application of a flexible ECoG
neural probe (Fig. 5A) consisting of electrodes with three different
sizes efficiently distributed on a soft pad [74, 75].
Advancements in ECoG recording systems have occurred with
regard to both detection and transmission. Indeed, several studies
have suggested that wireless ECoG recording systems can be implemented in BMI systems. For instance, Charvet et al. developed
a promising wireless 64-channel neural probe for the acquisition
of neural activity as recorded via ECoG [76]. Similarly, wireless
microscale ECoG neural probes have been used to investigate
reach-and-grasp movements in non-human primates [77]. In addition, Chang and Chiou developed a chronic ECoG system that
can be used to measure neural activity without communicating
wires or batteries [78]. Such findings suggest that this type of neural probe can be integrated not only in freely moving animals, but
also in humans.
Based on our review of studies involving high-performance
ECoG with a large number of channels, we conclude that ECoG
would be advantageous in BMI applications due to its relatively
low level of invasiveness [79] and the potential for long-term LFP
recording [80]. In addition, ECoG electrodes can be applied to
brain regions of various shapes, enabling the application of BMI
systems for various functions [74, 75]. We expect that advances in
ECoG electrodes will further facilitate BMI applications.
Injectable neural probe

able electronic devices for the measurement of chronic in vivo
neural activity (Fig. 5B) [81]. To establish injectable neural probes,
Liu et al. applied nanotechnology-based fabrication techniques to
develop electronics composed of flexible mesh [82, 83]. Injectable
mesh electronics can be produced via multiple fabrication techniques such as photolithography, which can be used to define the
structures and regions of nanoscale silicon wires, metal deposition,
and in the chemical development of nanostructures [82-85]. One
preliminary study revealed that such devices could be used to record neural activity in freely moving mice [86]. The mesh recording electrodes has less invasiveness compared to other counterpart
implantable probes due to their microscale size and high flexibility.
If the biocompatibility and quality of acquired neural signals can
be secured in the future, we believe that the injectable neural probe
offers a better alternative for detecting brain activity in various
BMI applications.
Stent electrodes array

A stent is a medical tube that can be implanted into the vessels
to maintain an opening for blood flow. Stents are widely utilized
in the treatment of arteriosclerosis since its appearance [87], as
they are significantly less invasive than traditional methods [88,
89]. To achieve minimal invasiveness and long-term biocompatibility, Oxley et al. developed an endovascular stent-electrode
array, as pictured in Fig. 5C [90]. Stent-electrode arrays can be
installed by inserting a catheter into the appropriate cerebral
blood vessel. Accurate induction of each electrode array position
can be acquired using x-ray angiographic fluorography. One preclinical study reported that stent-electrode arrays with multiple
neural probes could be used for the long-term measurement of
somatosensory evoked potentials in the sheep brain. The feasibility and sustainable biocompatibility of long-term/chronic neural
interfaces in brain blood vessels have been confirmed via x-ray
micro-tomography and histological assays [91]. Recent studies
have demonstrated that endovascular stent-electrode arrays can
be used to acquire vascular ECoG signals [92] and detect electrochemical changes via impedance spectroscopy [93]. Despite such
advancements, no studies have demonstrated that state-of-the-art
stent electrodes can provide immediately usable neural signals (e.g.,
movement-related activity) for BMI applications. Nonetheless,
researchers have successfully acquired somatosensory evoked potentials from stent electrodes implanted in the superficial cortical
vein overlying the motor cortex in sheep via catheter angiography
[90]. Therefore, future studies may be able to harness movementrelated information conveyed to stent electrodes to enhance BMI
development.

Wireless neural probes for BMIs

The use of physical wires inside the brain to acquire neural signals is associated with several disadvantages, such as the risk of
infection and reduced freedom of movement. To overcome these
shortcomings, researchers have investigated the application of
wireless neural recording techniques to BMI systems. For instance,
Schwarz et al. developed a wireless multi-channel platform for
monitoring neural activity, which was applied successfully in freely
moving non-human primates [94]. This system, which resembles a

460

crown, consists of hundreds to thousands of microwire electrodes,
a wireless recording/transmitting module, and a battery. In addition, the same research group introduced a wheelchair robot that
could be controlled based on neural activity recorded wirelessly
from an onboard monkey [95]. Similarly, Libedinsky et al. investigated the application of a robotic vehicle independently moved
by neural signals using a 100-channel wireless probe. Su et al. introduced a wireless implantable recording/stimulating probe for
bidirectional BMIs, as described in Fig. 5D [96]. This latter probe is
https://doi.org/10.5607/en.2018.27.6.453

Implantable Neural Probes for BMI

advantageous due to its small size and ability for remote charging.
Researchers have also investigated the application of ultrasound
technology as a carrier of neural signals from medium-depth tissue. Such “neural dust” systems are advantageous in that they are
able to send and receive information non-invasively in certain areas of the brain. Seo et al. investigated a neural dust system consisting of recording electrodes, a piezoelectric ultrasound generator,
drive electrodes, and a wireless cortical recording platform [97].
In this system, an external ultrasound probe sends out an echo
with a specific waveform, following which a reflected wave (i.e.,
neural signal) is emitted from the system. This neural signal can
be isolated by examining the specific waveform transmitted and
the backscattered signal. Preliminary studies designed to measure
neural activity in the peripheral nervous system using a neural
dust system in rats have demonstrated the potential of these systems for application in BMI technologies.
We anticipate that advancements in the following areas will
promote the use of wireless neural electrodes in practical BMI
applications: ultra-low power consumption, high signal-to-noise
ratio, sufficient maximum communication distance for receiving
and transmitting data, and channel number [76, 98]. Furthermore,
wireless BMI systems must be designed to prevent malfunctions
by erasing noise from the external environment, to have an efficient means of changing the battery, and to function for a long
period of time on single charge [99, 100].
MULTI-MODAL NEURAL PROBES TO MEASURE BOTH ELECTRICAL AND OPTICAL SIGNALS

While direct electrical measurements can be obtained using implantable neural probes as described in previous sections, optical
measurement methods are also utilized to record neural activity
at the level of single neurons and neuronal assemblies. Optical
methods rely on indices such as the influx of calcium ions (Ca2+)
and changes in voltage. Since changes in Ca2+ can represent neural
activity, several optical indicators have been applied in studies
ranging from in vitro cellular assays [101, 102] to in vivo investigations in freely moving animals [103]: a bioluminescent Ca2+ probing protein (Aequorin) [104], chemical Ca2+ indicators (calcium
green, fura-2 etc.) [105, 106], genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators
based on a single fluorophore [107] and Förster resonance energy
transfer (FRET) [108]. In addition, voltage-sensitive optical dyes
can be used to identify transient changes in action potentials in
neurons [109-111]. In addition, voltage-sensitive optical dyes
can be used to identify transient changes in action potentials in
neurons. Indeed, researchers have developed optical implantable
neural probes for use in freely behaving animals by combining
https://doi.org/10.5607/en.2018.27.6.453

fiberoptic and wireless communication technologies. For instance,
Murayama et al. designed a miniaturized neuro-endoscopic
periscope using graded-index (GRIN) lenses and micro-prism
coupled fibers. This periscope was used to study dendritic Ca2+
changes in freely moving mice [112]. Ghosh et al. introduced a
prototype of a miniaturized wide-field fluorescence microscope
with which they could measure neural activity when the device
was mounted on the head of freely moving animals [113]. Besides,
optical neuro-stimulations were exercised since the discovery of
optogenetics stimulation. Furthermore, optical devices can be used
for stimulation purposes as well: In the case of Channelrhodopsin
(ChR), trans-membrane pores are opened when ChR-integrated
ion channels absorb blue light at a wavelength of 470 nm, causing
ions to flow into the neurons [114-116]. Preclinical studies have
confirmed that fiber-coupled illumination devices function well
in freely moving animals. Aravanis et al. designed a fiber-coupled
optical neural interface guided by ChR2-mCherry fluorescence
images for use in rats [117]. Several research groups have also
developed prototypes of wirelessly integrated LED-based implantable neural stimulation modules for use in freely moving animals
[118-120].
Electrical and optical signals can be measured without interference from one another because their frequency domains are different. For this reason, several prototypes of multi-modal neural
probes have been developed to measure both electrical and optical
activity in preclinical studies [121, 122]. LeChasseur et al. developed a micro-probe, which consists of a dual-core optical fiber
and a 50-μm electrical wire probe for recording both electrical and
optical neural activities, as illustrated in Fig. 6A [123]. In a comparative study, the authors recorded optical and electrical neural signals from the same neuron in rats, observing that the two modalities were complementary and highly correlated with one another.
Anikeeva et al. developed an optetrode, which is composed of a
200-μm single-channel optical fiber and a tetrode, to investigate
optical stimulation and neural responses (recorded by the tetrode),
as described in Fig. 6B [124]. The optetrode detected multi-unit
neural activity and transient changes when optical stimulation was
provided at different frequencies. Voigts et al. investigated an ultralight weight neural probe (i.e., FlexDrive) consisting of a singlecore optical fiber and 16, 32, or 64-channel electrodes for studies
of multi-dimensional neural responses to optogenetic stimulation [125]. Kwon and colleagues combined a transparent ECoG
electrode array and an optical illumination device for optogenetic
stimulation [126]. In another preliminary in vivo study, the authors proposed a prototype of a multi-modal neural probe termed
the Opto-μECoG array, which exhibits sufficient biocompatibility.
Several researchers have also introduced variations of the Utah

array combined with miniaturized optical components to acquire
high-resolution electrical neural signals following optical neurostimulation [127, 128]. Similarly, previous studies have reported
the success of BMI systems based on optogenetic neuromodulation and electrical neural recordings in small animals [129-135].
For example, Liu et al. developed a compact optogenetics system
using graphene electrodes to reduce artifacts [136]. We expect that
multi-modal BMI systems will evolve toward more specific applications when the safety and stability of both probes have been
demonstrated.
Based on previous research, we expect the following benefits to
be associated with the use of multi-modal neural probes that combine optical and electrophysiological modalities in BMI systems.
When using neural probes to record both optical and electrical
neural signals, cross-validation of fidelity between the two signals
can increase signal reliability. In particular, since the noise sources
of the two signals are likely to be different, one signal can be used
when another signal is perturbed. In the context of BMI applications, multi-modal probes may be useful when the patient is in
an electromagnetically noisy environment. Such probes may also
be advantageous for advanced BMI systems that require precise
stimulation and minimal interference between signals. However,
few optogenetic genes have been identified and cleared for use in
humans due to safety concerns [137, 138]. Genetic engineering

remains quite challenging due to its unknown long-term impact
on humans, although it is expected that these technologies will be
utilized in various BMI systems once issues regarding safety and
stability have been addressed.
NEURAL PROBES WITH ADVANCED MATERIALS

In order for successful implantation in the human brain, neural
probes must exhibit sufficient biocompatibility, safety, stability,
and electrical performance. However, electrodes composed of
classic materials such as iridium oxide and platinum are limited in
their ability to meet these conditions. To overcome these limitations, advanced materials with special functions and properties
including metals, inorganic materials, and polymers have been applied to the development of neural probes.
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are cylindrically structured allotropes
of carbon that are stronger and have better elasticity and electrical properties than more traditional materials [139, 140]. As such,
various studies have aimed to develop neural probes using CNTs.
Wang et al. designed a microelectrode array composed of CNTs,
reporting significant improvements in the charge injection limit
when CNT electrodes were used to stimulate cultured hippocampal neurons [141]. Keefer et al. developed a CNT coating to enhance charge transfer in microelectrode arrays [142]. In this study,
https://doi.org/10.5607/en.2018.27.6.453

Implantable Neural Probes for BMI

the authors obtained stronger neural activity from CNT-coated
electrodes in the primate visual cortex, with an improvement factor of 7.4 dB (Fig. 7A). Guitchounts et al. developed 16-channel
carbon fiber neural probes with which they could acquire longterm chronic neural signals due to the strength and stability of the
carbon fiber [143]. In addition, previous studies have demonstrated the successful integration of a soft CNT fiber microelectrode
array in long-term bidirectional neural interfaces. Such findings
suggest that this system can be used to develop high-performance
and biocompatible BMI devices and neuroprosthetic instruments
[144]. Graphene, a two-dimensional carbon allotrope, can also be
utilized to improve the performance of neural probes due to its
mechanical stiffness, flexibility, and superior electrical properties
[145]. For instance, Chen et al. designed flexible graphene microprobes that can be applied to record electrical signals associated
with neural or cardiac activity [146]. Graphene-based flexible electrodes have also been fabricated to acquire ECoG signals by improving contact with the brain. Additional studies have indicated
that graphene can be used to investigate changes in neural activity
due to optogenetic stimulation due to its high transparency [147].
Similarly, Kuzum et al. developed a graphene electrode array with
high flexibility and transparency: They acquired electrical neural
signals and fluorescence images indicating changes in calcium
flux using the same electrode [148]. Furthermore, graphene-based
electrodes can be integrated into multi-functional neural probes.
For instance, Liu et al. introduced neural probes that consist of
graphene-oxide and gold-oxide electrodes, as illustrated in Fig.

7B [149]. This novel probe can be used to obtain measurements
of both electrophysiological neural signals and electrochemical
information via cyclic voltammetry. Indeed, this type of electrode
can be used to monitor neural activity and various electrochemical
changes after the induction of brain damage due to photo-thrombosis. Apollo et al. also investigated the application of needle-type
flexible neural probes made from graphene oxide for use in bidirectional neural interfaces [150].
Due to the development of efficient techniques for fabricating
and manufacturing nanoscale structures and particles, nanotechnology has quickly become relevant to biological and biomedical
applications Indeed, nanoscale structures and particles have been
applied to improve neural probes. Park et al. developed a nanoporous platinum electrode that can be used to record neural signals
[151]. In this study, the authors reported that the nanoporous electrodes were associated with improvements in electrical properties, impedance, and charge injection limits when compared with
commercially available alternatives such as platinized platinum
and iridium oxide electrodes. Other studies have demonstrated
the enhanced biocompatibility of gallium phosphide nanowire
electrodes [152]. These nanowire electrodes were tested in the rat
primary somatosensory cortex. Abidian and colleagues introduced
nanostructured polymer-coated conducting electrodes with enhanced electrical properties, improved mechanical adhesion, and
better neuronal attachment capabilities [153]. Piret et al. developed
boron-doped diamond electrodes with three dimensionally fabricated nanostructures using multiple semiconductor fabrication

techniques [154]. Relative to conventional boron-doped diamond
electrodes, the nanostructured electrodes offer higher sensitivity
to neural activity while maintaining stability and biocompatibility,
suggesting that these electrodes can be applied in the development
of highly sensitive BMI systems and rehabilitation instruments.
CONCLUSIONS

In this report, we have reviewed the application of current multichannel neural probes (i.e., the tetrode, Utah array, and Michigan
probe) to BMI systems, as well as developments regarding nextgeneration neural probes. When comparing the electrodes currently in use, it is important to choose the proper neural probe
based on the function and purpose of the BMI application. For
instance, for measurement and stimulation of pyramidal neurons
in deep sulcus areas—which are known to directly control fine
muscles such as those in the hand—a neural probe with a longer
shank is required. We also discussed several developing neural
probes, which aim to improve upon the electrical properties, biocompatibility, and reliability of current devices using multi-modal
approaches. If high-density electrodes with improved biocompatibility can be developed, flexible ECoG systems can be more widely
applied in both clinical and preclinical BMI studies. Although
stent electrodes are currently at the proof-of-concept stage, their
minimal invasiveness suggests that they can replace many other
methods for acquiring neural signals in the future. Safety concerns
represent the greatest challenge for BMI systems based on optogenetic stimulation. The application of new materials, high-resolution integrated technologies, and nanotechnology will ultimately
contribute to the development of high-performance neural probes
and BMI systems.
While the long-term fidelity of neural recordings is critical for
success in BMI systems, several subsequent stages of processing
are critical for ensuring the efficiency of these systems (Fig. 1).
Decoding algorithms that allow for accurate analysis of acquired
neural signals and encoding techniques that transfer outward
information to the brain are also important components of a BMI
system [155-158]. High-speed computing and wireless signal processing are also critical for the development of high-performance
BMI systems that can be applied in real-world settings.
Perhaps the most important issue facing developers is the biocompatibility and mechanical suitability of implantable neural
probes. Advancements in material science and mechanical techniques will aid in developing strategies for minimizing brain
scarring while maintaining adequate electrode contact [159, 160].
Assessments of signal quality and side effects should be performed
in both in vitro and in vivo systems (e.g., non-human primates) to

464

www.enjournal.org

determine the practical applications of novel BMI systems prior to
use in humans. For these reasons, it is also necessary to choose appropriate packaging techniques to enhance the biocompatibility of
implantable neural probes.
Mass production and security concerns should also be addressed
in the development of neural probes for commercial and realworld use. Because the electrode is inserted into the brain, proper
mass manufacturing technologies are required, without sacrificing
the quality of the probe from production to packaging. Thus, systematic inspection methods should also develop. Several security
experts have cautioned that information leakage may occur when
using BMI systems [161, 162]. Therefore, establishing technologies to prevent information leakage is another issue that must be
addressed when considering the practical applications of BMI systems. In conjunction with technological advancements, consensus
regarding social and ethical concerns will lead to widespread utilization of implantable neural probes and BMI systems.
