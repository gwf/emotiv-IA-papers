Abstract: Rapid and accurate detection of driver fatigue is of great significance to improve traffic safety.
In the present work, we propose the man-machine response mode (MRM) to relieve driver fatigue
caused by long-term driving. In this paper, the characteristics of the complex brain network, which
can effectively reflect brain activity information, were used to detect the change of driving fatigue over
time. Combined with the traditional eye movement characteristics and a subjective questionnaire
(SQ), the changes in driving fatigue characteristics were comprehensively analyzed. The results show
that driving fatigue can be effectively delayed using the MRM. Additionally, the response equipment
is low in cost and practical, so it will be practical to use in actual driving situations in the future.
Keywords: driving fatigue relieving; MRM; brain network; eye movement; SQ

1. Introduction
Fatigue driving is one of the main causes of traffic accidents [1,2]. Previous investigations found
that 15–20% of fatal crashes involve driver fatigue [3–5]. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly and
accurately detect driving fatigue and take measures to relieve it in time. Researchers have mainly
studied the problem of driving fatigue detection from subjective and objective aspects. The former type
of judgment of driving fatigue is mainly based on the subjective judgment of the driver [6]. The latter
mainly judges driving fatigue based on physiological characteristics of drivers. Previous studies have
found that human physiological signals, such as electrocardiogram (ECG), electrooculogram (EOG)
and electroencephalogram (EEG), can effectively reflect people’s mental fatigue.
There have been many studies on mental fatigue based on human physiological signal
characteristics [7,8]. Previous studies have showed that human mental fatigue is associated with eye
movement characteristics [9–11]. Di Stasi et al. found that the saccadic eye movement parameters
are sensitive indicators for human mental fatigue [12]. Schleicher et al. found a strong correlation
between human mental fatigue and eye movement [13]. Cruz et al. showed that the eye and eyelid
movement can be used as predictors of performance decrement resulting from mental fatigue [14].
There have been many studies on human mental fatigue based on EEG signal features. Four frequency
sub-bands δ (0–4 Hz), θ (4–8 Hz), α (8–14 Hz) and β (14–32 Hz) are widely applied to analyze the
state of driving fatigue. For example, the relative energy ratio (α + β)/δ1 [15] is an algorithm that uses
the EEG alpha spindle and detection of the alpha band relative energy to signify the level of driving
fatigue [5]. A previous study has shown that the brain fatigue characteristics can be easily detected
from the posterior (P3, P4) brain region using EEG signals [7]. Therefore, the leads associated with the
brain region can be used as the preferred ones for the analysis of driving fatigue in this study. In our
study, we mainly measure the driving fatigue based on the characteristics of EEG and EOG.

There are many traditional ways to relieve human mental fatigue, such as reducing the intensity
of work, having a short rest, drinking caffeinated beverages and taking special medicines. In recent
years, electrical stimulation has been widely studied as a novel method to relieve human fatigue [16,17].
Dailey et al. found that human pain and fatigue can be relieved by using transcutaneous electrical nerve
stimulation [18]. Zhao concluded that human physiological fatigue can be relieved by stimulating
points of the human body [19]. In terms of human cognition, some studies have shown that a proper
number of cognitive tasks are more conducive to alleviating mental fatigue than a small number.
Oron-Gilad et al. demonstrated that some cognitive tasks, especially ones involving understanding
and memory, could keep drivers alert [20]. Research by Verwey and Zaidel showed that when
drivers perform an attention-demanding secondary task while driving, this can effectively improve
alertness [21]. Drory’s experimental results showed that a non-mandatory driving-related task of a
reasonable size could make a driver maintain high levels of alertness [22]. Gershon et al. indicated
that undertaking an interactive cognitive task could effectively inhibit driving fatigue [23]. In our
study, based on the above research [20–23], we adopted a method to appropriately increase the driver’s
cognitive intensity (for example, by doing a non-mandatory driving-related task) to relieve driving
fatigue caused by long-term driving.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Subjects
A total of 12 healthy subjects (10 males and 2 females; aged 32 ± 1.6 (standard deviation, SD))
were selected from a pool of volunteers to carry out the experiment. All subjects had to hold a driver’s
license. Additionally, they needed to satisfy the conditions of having no sleep diseases and no other
mental disease. They also had to be free of medication during the experiment. During the experiment,
subjects were not allowed to drink alcohol, coffee or other nerve-stimulating drinks. Additionally,
the experiment was divided into two types, with the normal driving mode being arranged in the first
type of experiment and the man-machine response mode (MRM) being arranged in the second one.
All subjects needed to complete the two types of driving mode experiments. It should be noted that
the MRM mode of experiment can only be carried out after all subjects have completed the first type of
experiment. All subjects were numbered from 1 to 12. In the experiment, the subjects were tested in
sequence according to their number. Only one subject was assigned to the experiment each day.
2.2. Procedure and Electroencephalogram (EEG) Recording
This experiment was carried out in a laboratory-simulated driving environment. The indoor
temperature of the laboratory was 20–25 ◦ C, and the humidity was 30–50% relative humidity (RH).
A vehicle simulator (JT/T378) was used to simulate the real driving environment. This model of the
simulator included several main components such as the accelerator, clutch, foot brake, computer,
steering wheel, hand brake, and liquid crystal display. The upper computer driving software included
a variety of driving modes, one of which was the driving teaching mode. In the experiment stages,
all subjects were required to drive continuously at a speed of 80–100 km/h. The weather was sunny, with
broad vision and good visibility. Meanwhile, the subjects were asked to drive in a road environment
with low traffic volume. All subjects were instructed to drive in automatic mode. Movements unrelated
to the experiment, such as head and hand movements, were avoided as much as possible to reduce
artefacts in the EEG recording.
This experiment was carried out using a car simulator. Figure 1 shows the experimental
environment and the experimental equipment used. All subjects continuously drove for three hours
(13:00–16:00 p.m.). Seven sets of data were collected for every subject. The data acquisition was divided
into seven stages (stage 1–13:00 p.m., stage 2–13:30 p.m., stage 3–14:00 p.m., stage 4–14:30 p.m., stage
5–15:00 p.m., stage 6–15:30 p.m. and stage 7–16:00 p.m.). For each stage, data collection lasted for
3 min at a time. Additionally, half an hour of sleep (12:00–12:30 p.m.) was arranged for all subjects to

2.3.1. Statistical Analysis Algorithm
The statistical analysis method (two-tailed t-tests) was applied in our study. Using this method,
we compared the differences in detection results. In the comparative analysis section, the two-tailed
test was used to identify significant differences in driving fatigue between the two driving modes (the
MRM and the normal driving mode).

2.3.2. Signal Preprocessing
The EEG signal is a weak electrical signal, which is extremely vulnerable to external interference.
Therefore, denoising is needed before signal analysis. In our experiment, we chose the WPD, which
can provide more sophisticated analysis of signals, to deal with the noise. Additionally, the WPD can
also select a suitable frequency band to match the signal spectrum according to the characteristics of
signal analysis, which can reflect the essential characteristics of the signal. The formula of WPD is
shown as follows:
Assume that the original signal is expressed as f (t). We obtained 2i sub-bands in the i points class
after WPD. The source signal f (t) can be expressed as:
f (t) =

i −1
2P

j=0

fi, j (t j ) = fi,0 (t0 ) + fi,1 (t1 ) + · · · + fi,2i −1 (t2i −1 )

(1)

in which, j = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 2i − 1, fi,j (tj ) is the reconstruction of signals in the ith layer node (i,j) when
using wavelet packet decomposition. According to Parseval theorem and Equation (1), the energy
spectrum of the signal f (t) after WPD can be calculated and obtained:
Z
Ei,j (t j ) =

Γ

| fi,j (t j )|2 dt =

m
P
k =1

|x j,k |2

(2)

in which, Ei,j (tj ) is the band energy by which f(t) was decomposed to node (i,j) using WPD.
xj,k (j = 0,1,2, . . . ,2i −1; k = 1,2, . . . ,m) is the discrete points amplitude of the reconstructed signal
fi,j (tj ). m is the signal sampling points. In our study, we conducted 4-layer decomposition of the band
to extract θ (4–8 Hz), α (8–14 Hz) and β (14–32 Hz) rhythms.
2.3.3. Correlation Coefficient
In statistics, the Pearson correlation coefficient (Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient,
abbreviated as PPMCC or PCCs) is a method for measuring the relationship between two variables.
In this paper, we use this method to analyze the relationship between any two channels of EEG signals.
The Pearson correlation coefficient is defined by:
rXY =

E[(X − E(X))(Y − E(Y))]
E(XY) − E(X)E(Y)
=
σX σY
σX σY

(3)

in which, E(·) is the expected value operator, and σX , σY are the standard deviation (SD). In the present
situation, we analyzed series consisting of n samples of data. Accordingly, the correlation coefficient
was computed by:
n
P
xi yi − nxy
n
1 P
i=1
xi −x yi −y
rXY =
(4)
(
)( σY ) =
n − 1 i=1 σX
( n − 1 ) σX σY
in which, x and y are the series means, and σX , σY are the standard deviation.
2.3.4. The Complex Brain Networks
Previous studies have shown that the method of analyzing brain network connectivity has been
proven to be a very effective and informative way to analyze brain function and mental state [28–30].
In this study, we used the two parameters of the complex network, clustering coefficient and global
variables, to analyze the brain functional differences of subjects. These two parameters are described
in the following sections.
•

Clustering Coefficient

Sensors 2019, 19, 4883

6 of 18

For node i of a complex network, which is expressed as the ratio of the number of existing edges
to the number of maximum possible edges between the neighbors of i [31,32], the clustering coefficient
can be represented as:
Ei
Ci =
(5)
Di (Di − 1)/2
in which, Ei is the number of existing edges between the neighbors of node i and Di is the degree of
connectivity of node i.
•

Global efficiency

The higher the value of the complex network’s parameter G, the faster the information transmission
is. Li,j is the path length between two nodes i and j, which is the minimum number of edges needed to
connect. Li,j is mathematically defined as Equation (6) [31,32]:
L=

N
X
1
Dij
N (N − 1)

(6)

i,j=1,i,j

in which, Dij is the minimum path length L between nodes i and j. N is the number of nodes within a
network. The global efficiency of nodes can be defined by:
G = E global =

X 1
1
Li,j
N (N − 1)

(7)

i, j∈G

in which, Li,j is the minimum path length between nodes i and j. N is the number of nodes within a
network. From Equation (7), it can be concluded that a network, which is characterized by a short
minimum path length between any pair of regional nodes, has high global efficiency [33,34].
In this paper, the correlation coefficients between pairs of signals from 14 channels were calculated
using Equation (4). Then, brain networks were constructed according to the following steps.
The sub-band signals θ (4–8 Hz), which were extracted from the denoised EEG signals (Figure 3A),
were used to construct the adjacent matrix (Figure 3B). Then, a reasonable threshold value T was
determined, which was used to determine the edge connection between two nodes. This means that
there was an edge connection between node i and node j if the correlation coefficient between them
was greater than the threshold value T, otherwise, no edge existed between nodes i and j. Finally,
the networks
were formed (Figure 3C).

35 Hz) are particularly useful for characterizing brain activity. Their different power spectrum ratios,
θ/β, θ/α + β, θ + α/β, θ + α/α + β, and β/α, are often used to analyze people’s mental fatigue
characteristics, which can also show different characteristics of driving fatigue [31,35,36]. In this
paper, we used the ratio β/(θ + α) to analyze driving fatigue.

ratios, θ/β, θ/α + β, θ + α/β, θ + α/α + β, and β/α, are often used to analyze people’s mental fatigue
characteristics, which can also show different characteristics of driving fatigue [31,35,36]. In this paper,
we used the ratio β/(θ + α) to analyze driving fatigue.
2.3.6. Subjective Questionnaire
Previous studies have shown that the subjective questionnaire (SQ) is an effective method to
evaluate people’s mental fatigue [37,38]. In this paper, we used the 7-point Samne Perelli Fatigue Scale
(1-Fully alert, wide awake, 2-Very lively, responsive, but not at peak, 3-Okay, somewhat fresh, 4-A little
tired, less than fresh, 5-Moderately tired, let down, 6-Extremely tired, very difficult to concentrate,
7-Completely exhausted, unable to function effectively) to evaluate the driving fatigue of the subjects.
At each stage of the experiment, subjects were asked to rate their subjective fatigue and give a score.

Figure 5. The response error rates of the subjects.
Figure 5 shows the response error rates of subjects in this experiment. From the data in the figure,
it can be concluded that with the driving time, the reaction time of the subjects increased, and some of
them had already exceeded the time limit. In addition, the response error rate also showed an upward
trend over time. This means that although this driving mode can combat driving fatigue, driving
fatigue will still become more and more serious with the extension of driving time.
3.3. Brain Network Analysis
3.3.1. Choice Threshold (T)
Previous studies have shown that when people gradually enter a state of mental fatigue, the EEG
activity characteristics in the human brain will change accordingly [39]. Craig et al. found that the
activities of θ and α increased with the gradual increase of human mental fatigue [32]. Belyavin
and Wright observed an increase in the θ activities and a decrease in the β activities when a human
gradually became mentally fatigued and their alertness decreased [40]. Other studies have also shown
an increase in θ activity during mental fatigue [36,41,42]. Summing up the research results of the
above studies, we can conclude that when humans gradually become mentally fatigued, their alertness
decreases along with an increase in θ activity (see Section 4.2 for details). Therefore, we used the θ
sub-band signals to analyze driving fatigue using the brain network.
In order to analyze the differences in brain network features constructed using different thresholds,
networks were formed at all the thresholds for each stage. In our study, we conducted a comparison of
the whole range of values of T, 0.01 < T < 0.51, with increments of 0.025, and repeated the calculation
for each value of T. In general, the selection of the threshold value should depend on the research
problem and should fall within the scope of an educated guess [43]. Figure 6 shows the comparison
of the coefficient C averaged over subjects in the driving stage 1 with that of other stages (driving
stages 2–7).

Figure 6 shows the changes in the clustering coefficient C for different brain networks. Obviously,
the changes in C showed a downward trend in all driving stages. The contrast difference was significant
when the threshold value was chosen in the numerical interval 0.235~0.46 (stage 1–2:|t| = 4.151 > t0.05,18
= 2.101, p = 0.001 < 0.05; stage 1–3: |t| = 3.653 > t0.05,18 = 2.101, p = 0.002 < 0.05; stage 1–4: |t| = 3.492 >

this method, the threshold interval (0.26~0.435) with significant differences in global efficiency was
determined. We can conclude that the parameter (G, C) difference in the brain network is obvious
when the threshold interval is selected to be 0.26~0.435. In our study, the mean value of the threshold
interval 0.26~0.435 was calculated to be T = 0.3475. The brain network corresponding to each stage of
the driving experiment was constructed. The results are shown in Figure 7.

3.4. The Relative Power Spectrum Ratio
Previous studies have shown that it is very common to analyze people’s mental fatigue state by
using the relative power spectrum of EEG signals. The variation tendency of the relative power
spectrum ratio β/(θ + α) over time is shown in Figure 9.

From Figure 8, we can clearly see that these two brain network parameters (C and G), which
relate to the brain networks of the subjects in two driving modes (driving in normal mode and in the
MRM), showed increasing trends over time. Moreover, these two brain network parameters (C and
G) showed significant differences in the two driving experimental modes (C: t = 2.678 > t0.05,12 = 2.179,

judgment, which seriously threatens traffic safety [45–47]. Traffic accidents caused by driving fatigue
account for a considerable proportion of all accidents [48,49]. Hence, it is necessary to effectively
relieve driving fatigue. Studies have shown that repetitive and monotonous external environmental
information can easily lead human beings to be in a state of mental fatigue, in which our brain activity
is inhibited [50–52]. In our study, we tried to stimulate human brain nerves repeatedly to keep them
active all the time to combat mental fatigue.
4.1. Brain Network
Previous studies have shown that the characteristics of the brain network change with the changes
of human alertness [53–55]. Kar and Sun indicated that there is a growth trend of the two parameters
(C and G) as subjects’ fatigue deepens [33,56]. Stam et al.’s study showed that human mental fatigue
continues to deepen during the continuous operation processes, and the corresponding brain network
parameters C and G show overall upward trends [57]. This result is consistent with our research.
In this study, as shown in Figure 8, the two brain network parameters (C and G) of the subjects driving
in normal mode also showed overall upward trends. However, the subjects driving with MRM showed
slower upward trends because the brain nerves were continuously stimulated at successive driving
stages, which keep the nerves in a relatively excited state.
4.2. The Relative Power Spectrum Ratio
Previous studies have shown that when people gradually enter a state of mental fatigue, the EEG
activity characteristics in the human brain will change accordingly [39]. Craig et al. found that the
activities of θ and α increased with a gradual increase in human mental fatigue [32]. Belyavin and
Wright observed an increase in θ activities and a decrease in β activities when humans gradually
became mentally fatigued and their alertness decreased [40]. According to the study by Torsvall and
Åkerstedt, an increase in α activities is the most sensitive indicator of mental fatigue [58]. Other studies
have also shown an increase in θ activity during mental fatigue [36,41,42]. Summing up the research
results of the above researchers, we conclude that when humans gradually become mentally fatigued,
their alertness decreases along with increases in θ and α activities and a decrease in β activities. Based
on this viewpoint, the ratio (β/θ + α) will decrease with the deepening of mental fatigue, which is
consistent with our research results, as shown in Figure 9.
4.3. Eye Movement
In our experiment, the eye movement signals were very obvious. When people perform eye
movements (move to right or move to left), the voltage changes in opposite directions will occur in
symmetrical brain regions and corresponding EEG waves will also show fluctuations in opposite
directions. In our study, for eye movement signals, the timestamp from the beginning of the fluctuations
to the stable fluctuations was at least 20, as shown in Figure 10. At this time, the K value is calculated
by Equation (8), whose absolute value was at least 2. In our study, we chose a time window of 20
and |K| > 2 to detect eye movements. The eye movement signals, whose waves showed opposite
characteristics in symmetrical brain regions, were identified using the Pearson correlation coefficient.
In this paper, taking the time width as 20, the fluctuation characteristics of the eye movement signals
were calculated, and the absolute minimum value of the Pearson correlation coefficient for two
symmetric channel (F3 and F4) signals was 0.85. Therefore, we chose this condition (|K| > 2 and |r| >
0.85) to judge eye movement.
Studies have shown that eye movement frequency is related to mental fatigue [59,60]. Marzano
et al. studied human eye movements and concluded that when humans gradually enter a state of
mental fatigue, their eye movements become significantly slower [61]. The research organized by Shin
et al. showed that when subjects’ driving fatigue gradually deepened, their eye movement frequency
decreased obviously [62]. Cazzoli et al. and Russo et al. concluded that people’s ability to obtain
external information from the eyes was weakened when their mental fatigue continued to deepen,

Sensors 2019, 19, 4883

14 of 18

which was characterized by a decrease in eye movement frequency [63,64]. These research conclusions
are consistent with our experimental results. In this study, as shown in Figure 12, the eye movement
frequency of subjects driving in normal mode also showed an overall downward trend. However,
the eye movement frequency of subjects driving with MRM showed a relatively slow downward
trend. The reason for the difference was that the MRM stimulated the brain nerves, causing subjects to
maintain their normal thinking activities, which meant that the brain nerves maintained their ability to
obtain outside information.
From the above comparative analysis, we can conclude that human bioelectric signals (EEG and
EOG) can effectively be used to monitor human driving fatigue and the MRM proposed in this paper
can effectively relieve driving fatigue caused by long-term monotonous driving. Thus, it can play an
important role in alleviating the symptoms of mental fatigue.
4.4. Previous Studies and This Study
Many traditional methods can be used to relieve human mental fatigue, such as stimulating
acupuncture points, reducing the intensity of work and having a short rest. Although using electricity
to stimulate acupuncture points of the human body can effectively combat mental fatigue, electrical
stimulation has some unavoidable side effects on the human body. Other traditional methods of
relieving fatigue usually require parking, which may not be feasible for long-distance driving. It is
uncertain whether there are side effects of relieving mental fatigue by long-term electrical stimulation
of human acupoints. Oron-Gilad et al. demonstrated that completing an appropriate number of
cognitive tasks, especially ones that involved understanding and memory, could keep drivers alert [21].
Verwey and Zaidel indicated that performing an attention-demanding secondary task can effectively
improve alertness when they drove for a long time [22]. Drory’s experimental result showed that a
non-mandatory driving-related task of a reasonable size could make a driver maintain a high level of
alertness [23]. An appropriate increase in cognitive activity by factors other than driving can indeed
effectively combat driving fatigue [21–23]. In this paper, we used this method to relieve driving
fatigue. However, we used mental arithmetic combined with reward and punishment mechanisms to
stimulate human brain nerves in order to effectively relieve mental fatigue. The equipment used in our
experiment is simple, portable and inexpensive. Normal driving is not affected when the equipment is
used to resist fatigue, and no sides effects are caused. The MRM method of resisting driver fatigue is
carried out online and in real time, which is of great significance for future practical applications.
In our experiment, we found that human eye movement signals were easily detected in the
prefrontal region of the human brain, and in symmetrical areas of the human brain, the wave signals of
eye movement were in opposite directions. Although eye movement signals can also be recognized
by selecting these two electrodes (one vertical and one horizontal), the signals of these two channels
fluctuate unidirectionally in the time domain. The simple method Equation (8) used in our manuscript
cannot distinguish unidirectional fluctuations from common interference signals, such as blinking.
To measure the signals in the prefrontal region of the human brain in this paper, we chose two
symmetrical channels (F3 and F4), for which the signal waveforms have a negative correlation when
eye movements occur. We used the Pearson correlation coefficient algorithm to identify eye movements.
In addition, the driving fatigue process is a process of physiological function change, and its
change is not completed instantaneously [65]. Previous experiments show that the driving fatigue
test generally lasts for 3–5 h, and the fatigue change curve also changes regularly with time [32].
The research by Rongrong demonstrated that the fatigue parameter (posterior probabilities) showed an
overall upward trend over time [3]. In the study of Luo, 50 EEG signals, which were used to analyze the
variation characteristics of driving fatigue, were saved in each experimental period [52]. In the whole
experimental process, the experimental stages are evenly divided, and in each experimental stage, the
subjects’ driving signals are detected for a short time. Then, the change trend of driving fatigue in the
whole experimental stage can be effectively detected [32]. Based on the above experimental research

Sensors 2019, 19, 4883

15 of 18

methods, we chose the method of collecting three-minute EEG signals every half hour to carry out
this research.
4.5. Limitations
In this study, we used the MRM to relieve driving fatigue caused by long-term monotonous
driving. And we also studied whether the extra increase of the cognitive load (arithmetic operation)
induced by the MRM will affect the subjects’ ability to cope with unexpected problems. The results
show that the average time taken by the subjects to respond to the emergency stop of the vehicles
ahead is 0.53 s in the MRM and 0.87 s in normal driving mode. Moreover, the standard deviation
of reaction time is 0.09 s in the MRM and 0.16 s in normal driving mode. There was a significant
difference in the emergency response time between the two driving modes (|t| = 6.108 > t0.05,22 = 2.074,
p = 0.00 < 0.05). It means that the extra increase of the cognitive load in this study will not affect the
subjects’ ability to cope with unexpected problems. Although this method was proven to be effective
in relieving long-term driving fatigue, only a simple mathematical operation was used in our work to
stimulate cranial nerves to make them active. Whether more complicated arithmetic operations are
more conducive to relieving or aggravating mental fatigue has not yet been studied.
Additionally, the selected threshold T in this paper is a common value for all subjects (10 males
and 2 females; aged 32 ± 1.6 (SD)). The T value in Figure 4 is a grand average between the subjects.
In the future, when the brain network method is applied to detect the driver’s driving fatigue state,
the selected threshold value T (T = 0.3475) will change due to the differences of individual drivers or
driving environment and other factors. Therefore, the brain network threshold T determined in this
paper is not applicable to all users.
4.6. Future Research Lines
Driving drowsiness is a state of physical fatigue that describes serious driving fatigue caused by
continuous long-term driving. At this time, the driver must stop driving for a rest. In future research,
our work will be mainly divided into three aspects. One is choosing different algebraic operations to
determine the relationship between the amount of cognition required other than driving and the effect
of relieving mental fatigue. The next is comparing the MRM method with existing effective fatigue
relieving methods, such as electrode shifts for head-resting, to further improve these methods. The last
one is using our method to alleviate driving fatigue in real driving.
5. Conclusions
In the present work, the MRM method was proposed for alleviating driving fatigue. Characteristics
of the complex brain network, which can effectively reflect brain activity information, were used
to detect the change of driving fatigue over time. Combined with the traditional eye movement
characteristics and the SQ, the changes of driving fatigue characteristics were comprehensively
analyzed. The results show that driving fatigue can be effectively relieved using the MRM, which
means that rhythmic stimulation of brain nerves for thinking activities can slow down the rate of
fatigue development. In addition, the response equipment is low cost and practical; therefore, it has
the potential to be used in actual driving situations in the future.
