Abstract: To investigate the correlation between electroencephalogram (EEG) and driving fatigue states, this study

5

used machine learning algorithms to detect driving fatigue based on EEG. EEG data of 14 channels were collected

6

from thirty-four healthy subjects in this research at Northeastern University. Each subject participated in two scenarios

7

(baseline and fatigue scenarios). Subjective ratings of fatigue levels were also obtained from the subjects using the

8

NASA-Task Load Index (TLX). The Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm was used to extract features from the

9

raw EEG data. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used as the classifier in the design of the machine learning

10

algorithm. A grid search cross validation was exploited to find optimal hyperparameter settings. The best classification

11

result was 90%, using all 14 EEG channels and linear kernel of SVM. The experimental results proved that a machine

12

learning algorithm was reliable to classify driving fatigue states using EEG data. This study demonstrated that CSP and

14

SVM were promising in detecting driving fatigue, and can, therefore, be strong foundations in future efforts to reduce
traffic accidents and save thousands of human lives.

1. Introduction

13

18

Many factors affect a driver’s ability to perform well and avoid mistakes, such as fatigue, illness, stress, and
many others [1]. Of these, fatigue is the most significant and avoidable factor. In the United States from 2005

19

to 2009, there were an estimated 83,000 crashes each year related to drowsy driving [2]. In 2014, there were 846

20

drowsiness-driving related fatalities, which was two percent of the overall total of driving fatalities [2].

Preventing driving fatigue has many significant aspects. Of individuals who reported being fatigued
while driving, nearly half were only driving for one hour or less. While drowsy driving affects over a third of all
drivers, drowsy driving is also common among commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers [2]. A U.S. Department
of Transportation study showed that 13 percent of CMV drivers were considered to have been drowsy at the
time of their crashes [3]. This is especially concerning because of how large and damaging commercial vehicles
can be, and because of the large number of hours those vehicles and their drivers spend on the road at one time.
By detecting and preventing drowsy driving, accidents related to fatigued driving of CMVs can be remarkably
reduced.
In addition, the costs of fatigue-related accidents can be reduced by identifying fatigue. The National

Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that these accidents account for over $12 billion in
damages each year, which come in the form of increased insurance premiums, damage to vehicles, and property,
injuries to the driver or others involved in the accident, or death. Numerous studies have been done to improve
driving conditions, such as intelligent human assistance systems, smart driving, and driving cognitive assistance,
etc. [4–7]. It is essential that we create a machine learning algorithm to detect driving fatigue.
The current literature surrounding use of electroencephalogram (EEG) to detect fatigue is inconsistent,
and there is little consensus on what specific factors indicate fatigue. In the studies reviewed, it has been
suggested that:
• Delta and Theta waves increase with fatigue increasing [8]

9

10

• Alpha spindle parameters increase with fatigue increasing [9]

11

• Alpha band relative energy increases with fatigue increasing [10]

12

• Alpha wave increases with fatigue increasing [11]

13

• Alpha band decreases with extreme fatigue increasing [12]

14

• A change in Delta and Theta waves indicates a transition to a fatigue state [13]

The findings of some of these studies contradict one another, making it evident that there is little
consensus on the individual factors that best identify driving fatigue. Because of the lack of consensus, this
study hypothesized that it would be advantageous to use a method that relies on a Common Spatial Pattern
algorithm (CSP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to analyze the raw data independently, instead of relying
on any specific groups of wavebands and limited human bias.

21

The CSP algorithm has been reliably used for dimension reduction since 1990, and it has been widely
used with multi-channel EEG data [14–17]. Some studies have used CSP to reduce EEG data dimensionality

22

and extract features in brain-computer interface applications [18, 19]. Another study used CSP to decode

20

24

movement target direction in non-human primates [20]. CSP has been demonstrated to be a successful method
for dimensionality reduction.

25

SVM has been widely used to classify many types of bio-signals [21–23]. It has been shown that SVM

26

has performed well in detecting contaminants in Electromyography (EMG) signals [24]. Some studies have

27

detected seizures successfully using EEG data based on SVM [25, 26]. Another study used the SVM to create a

23

recognition model to detect driving anger [27]. Hundreds of studies have shown that SVM was a valid method
to classify EEG data.
In this paper, we proposed a machine learning method for detecting driving fatigue using EEG data
collected on 14 channels. To achieve a better signal quality, independent component analysis was used to
remove noise in the signal. CSP was used as the feature extraction method, and SVM was used as the classifier.
The remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows: Section 2 shows the material and method of this
study. Section 3 represents the experimental results. Section 4 is the discussion and conclusion of the research.
Some main contributions of this work are as follows:
• The present study achieved a classification accuracy of 90% by using CSP and SVM for driving fatigue
detection.

37

• CSP proved to be an efficient and victorious technique for EEG dimensionality reduction and feature
extraction.

2.2. Experimental design
There were two driving scenarios designed for this experiment. The purpose of the first scenario was to
collect baseline data on the subjects, while the second scenario was designed to trigger driving fatigue. This
experimental design was approved by the Northeastern University IRB (#17-01-25).
a) Baseline/non-fatigue scenario:
In the baseline scenario, subjects were asked to drive along the outer perimeter roads in the virtual
environment as shown in Figure 3. The speed limit for this scenario was 60 MPH. This scenario lasted
for 5 minutes.
b) Fatigue scenario:
In the fatigue scenario, subjects were asked to follow the road signs in the virtual environment with
repeating random turns, simulating completing mundane tasks to help create a boring environment that
invited a quicker onset of fatigue. The speed limit for this scenario was also 60 MPH. This scenario lasted
for 25 minutes. Some research suggested that 30 minutes’ driving is enough to trigger fatigue [29]. The
road design of the fatigue scenario is shown in Figure 4.

2.3. Subject selection

Thirty-four subjects took part in this study (age mean = 22.5 years, SD = 2.09 years, 10 females). All subjects
were asked to sign the consent form before the experiment. The subjects were required to have a valid US
driver’s license to take part in this experiment. The subjects were instructed not to consume any caffeinated
beverages, such as coffee or energy drinks, and avoid similar stimulants for twenty-four hours prior to the
experiment. The subjects were advised to have a meal heavy in carbohydrates before the experiment since some
research demonstrated that carbohydrate-heavy meals help to trigger fatigue [30, 31]. The experiments took
place in the evening, after working hours.

before the subjects sat down to begin driving. This was to set a baseline for each subject. The second time was
immediately after completion of the driving task, in order to gauge the level of fatigue induced by driving in
the simulated environment. The self-rated fatigue level survey was based on the NASA-Task Load Index (TLX)

The EEG signal was collected across 14 channels by using an Emotiv device set to a sampling rate of
128 Hz with 2 reference channels. The EEG locations were based on the 10-20 system [28]. Each recording
was split into two sectors. The first three minutes were placed in the first sector, and the last three minutes
were placed in the second sector. The first sector was used as a representation of baseline data, and the second
sector was used as a representation of fatigue data. In total, six minutes of EEG data from each subject were
used for further pre-processing.

Using the raw EEG data of the 34 subjects from which to pull from, we selected 200 baseline data samples and
200 fatigue data samples, making 400 total samples. Baseline samples were selected from each subject’s first
sector data, and fatigue samples were selected from each subject’s second sector data. The 400 data samples
were selected based on visual inspection of the EEG data. The EEG data with obvious artifacts were removed,
as shown in Figure 5. Each of the 400 samples contained 10 seconds of the data (1280 data points) for each
of the 14 channels. The EEG data were filtered by using a band-pass filter from 1 Hz to 40 Hz. Signal noises
caused by eye blinks, eye movements were removed by using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in Matlab

20

with the EEGLAB toolkit (Mathworks, Natick, MA; UC San Diego, CA). The EEG data were also converted
to the frequency domain with the EEGLAB toolbox for preliminary analysis.

The features of the EEG data were extracted using CSP. The steps of the CSP method are shown below:

The final EEG signal features fB , fF are obtained by normalizing the covariance matrices RZB and
RZF . The dimension of each sample of raw EEG data was 14 channels × 1280 data points. After the CSP
filtering process, each feature was a 10 × 1 vector. The CSP algorithm was coded in Python 3.7 programming
language.
2.7. Classification
The SVM was initially introduced by Vapnik and colleagues in 1992 [33]. SVM is a two-class, supervised
machine learning classification method, which is defined by a hyperplane [34, 35]. Figure 6 shows an example
of a hyperplane generated by SVM. There were two classes of data points with the circled points as the support
vectors in the plot.

The principle idea of SVM is to find an optimal hyperplane that separates two different data sets with
the maximum margin possible between the two data sets. If we consider that there is a data set with two
categories of data { (x1 , y1 ), ( x2 , y2 ), ( x3 , y3 ), · · · , ( xn , yn )} , in which xi is a sample and yi is the label of
xi (yi ∈ {−1, 1} ), then the training process of SVM finds the parameters w and b of equation y = wx + b,
which defines the hyperplane. To find the optimal hyperplane, the maximum margin value is solved by the
equation,

When there are many features, using kernel function can make the SVM classification more efficient.
Four kinds of kernels were explored in this study, namely linear, Radial Basis Function (RBF), polynomial, and
sigmoid kernels.
The training and test split was 80/20 for the present study. A grid search cross validation was utilized
to find the optimal hyperparameters of the SVM classifier on the training set. A 5-fold cross validation was
used in this grid search. Different types of hyperparameters were explored. For instance, C is the cost factor
for the SVM. Gamma is the kernel coefficient for ’rbf’, ’poly’, and ’sigmoid’ kernels. The settings for the SVM
hyperparameters were shown in Table 1. Python 3.7 programming language was used for the SVM and grid
search algorithm.

Subjects were asked to report their fatigue level before and after the driving tasks. Each subject’s fatigue level
was measured by a survey on a 0-10 scale based on the NASA-TLX, with 10 being the most fatigued, and 0
being not at all fatigued. The average fatigue level for the baseline was 3.9 and the fatigue scenario had an
average fatigue level of 7. All subjects reported a higher fatigue level after the experiment, which demonstrated
that the scenario design triggered fatigue successfully (paired T-test, p<0.01, degrees of freedom (DOF)=33)
(Minitab, Version17, State College PA). The fatigue level of each subject, both before and after the driving
task, is shown in Figure 7.

All the data collection happened in the late afternoon and in the evening, which was beneficial for
triggering driving fatigue. Subjects’ self-reported fatigue level was used as a reference to see if the driving tasks
created driving fatigue in participants. Another study [11] used eye blinks as the indicator of driving fatigue.
Using eye blinks to indicate driving fatigue could be inaccurate, since many other reasons could cause eye blinks,
such as dry eye, refractive surgery, and dry contact lenses [36]. Another advantage of using the self-reported
fatigue level from 0 to 10 is that we can design new classification models that can predict a fatigue level from
anywhere within the 0 to 10 range that was desired.

The power spectrum plots and topographies of the EEG in baseline and fatigue states were generated with the
EEGLAB toolbox. Figure 8 shows an example of five topographies and one power spectrum plot created for
both baseline and fatigue EEG data. The 5 topographies were chosen from Delta band (1-3 Hz), Theta band
(4-8 Hz), Alpha band (8-13 Hz), Beta band (13-30 Hz), and Gamma band (30-50 Hz) respectively. The EEG
power spectrum plots show that the power of the EEG signal under the fatigue state increased around 13 Hz
to 15 Hz, compared to that under the baseline state. The EEG Alpha band power increased under the fatigue
state compared to the baseline state, which was consistent with [10] and [11] but contradicted [12]. According
to [8], Delta and Theta band power increased with fatigue level increasing, which was not observed in this study.
Based on the topographies, the EEG power near channel T7 escalated under the fatigue condition within the
Delta band. The Theta and Alpha band topographies did not show any change from the baseline state to the
fatigue state. The EEG power fell near channel O1 from the baseline state to the fatigue state within the Beta
band. The Gamma band topography showed an increase of EEG power near channel O2 and P8 under the
fatigue state.

3.3. Extracted feature results
CSP was used in this study to extract the EEG features from the raw data. An example of fatigue and nonfatigue features is shown in Figure 9. After applying the transformation matrix to the raw data and then
normalizing, it is clear that the feature value of the non-fatigue state has an increasing trend, while the feature
value of the fatigue state has a decreasing trend.

From Table 1, there were 80 combinations of the hyperparameter settings. The grid search ran 400 iterations
on the 320 training samples with a 5-fold cross validation. The grid search cross validation on the training set
shows that the optimal hyperparameter setting was ’linear’ as kernel type and 10 as C (cost factor).

22

Four kinds of kernels were tested in this study, namely linear kernel, RBF kernel, polynomial kernel, and
sigmoid kernel. The performance scores of different kernel types during grid search are shown in Figure 10.
During the grid search, the highest level of accuracy was obtained using the linear kernel at 87.12%. The RBF,
Polynomial, and Sigmoid kernels had performance accuracies of 81.7%, 79.3%, and 79% respectively in the grid
search.
Figure 11 shows the running time of different kernels types during grid search. The linear kernel had the
best running time performance of 0.001375 seconds per iteration. The Polynomial, Sigmoid, and RBF kernels
had running time performance of 0.001672, 0.001676, and 0.001800 seconds per iteration respectively in the
grid search. It is well known that EEG is high-dimensional data, which made it hard for classifiers to perform
the classification. The CSP algorithm tremendously reduced the dimensionality of the EEG data. As shown in
Figure 9, the data features obtained from the CSP algorithm were linearly separable. Using the SVM linear
kernel also sped up the classification process.

3.4.2. Final classification

Using the optimal hyperparameter settings (C = 10 , linear kernel), we ran the SVM on the test data set. The

The final classification performance was also evaluated using f1-score, precision, sensitivity, and specificity.
The evaluation results are shown in Table 2. We also compared our classification performance with other similar
literature studies. The comparison of different studies is shown in Table 3. Chaudhuri and Routray obtained
an accuracy of 86% by using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) and

SVM. But the classification running time was not reported in this study. In [38], Deep Generic Model (DGM)-

SVM was utilized to classify EEG data. Their best classification accuracy was 73.29%. But the sensitivity and
specificity were 91.10 % and 55.48 % respectively, which means their algorithm was not very accurate to find
the non-fatigue samples. Xiong et al. [39] research achieved a performance accuracy of 85% by using Kernel
Principal Component Analysis (KPCA)-SVM with EEG signal. The KPCA method extracted 17 features for
each sample and the average classification time was 0.2 seconds. The KPCA was a common dimensionality
reduction technique. However, CSP had a better performance in dimensionality reduction (10 features versus

17 features) and resulted in a faster classification speed. Hu et al. study [40] used Independent Component
Analysis with Reference (ICA-R) and SVM with 40 features, accomplishing a classification accuracy of 86%.
However, the average running time was not reported in this study. With the EEG signal, the classification
accuracy was around 80% to 90%. However, by combining EEG with heart rate variability (HRV), [41] achieved
a classification performance of 91%, which suggests using multiple signal modalities could potentially improve
classification performance.

different combinations of EEG channels were also tested in the present study. The first subset was from the
frontal and temporal areas. The second subset was from the frontal and parietal areas. The third subset was

shows the classification accuracy of different combinations of channels that were tested in the study.
With all of the channels used, the classification accuracy was 90%, while other combinations of channels
output lower levels of accuracy with limited variances between them. Reducing the numbers of EEG channels
didn’t improve classification accuracy. It is suggested that more channels of EEG should be collected in future
studies, and more combinations of channels should be tested. It has so far been demonstrated that the more
channels that are used, the higher the accuracy that the model produces.

4. Limitations and Conclusion

20

The present study investigated the effects of driving fatigue on EEG responses in a virtual environment. It
showed that EEG with machine learning algorithms can detect drivers’ driving fatigue successfully. However,
there are a few limitations in this study. First, more channels of EEG are recommended in future studies.
Second, 400 data samples (200 baseline data samples and 200 fatigue data samples) were obtained from 34
subjects in this research. In future studies, it is recommended to use a larger number of data samples and
also recruit elderly people. Third, future studies should focus on real driving scenarios instead of using driving
simulators.
In this study, a machine learning algorithm was created to classify EEG signals under baseline and fatigue
states. CSP was used as the feature extraction method and SVM was used as the classifier. A grid search cross
validation was utilized to find the optimal hyperparameter settings for the SVM. The highest accuracy was 90%
using self-collected EEG data in this study. It demonstrated that the machine learning method is a promising
way to detect driving fatigue and help decrease traffic accidents caused by driving fatigue.
