never before through vivid pictures. Brain images are seen
with regularity in movies, television shows, consumer

a backdrop of truly exciting brain science, popular rhetoric
evokes an illusion that neuroscience has provided a
roadmap connecting biology to mentation.1 According to
popular brain rhetoric, 2 the active, interconnected, and
healthy brain produces an authentic self, and the dimly lit
or dysfunctional brain is to blame for unhappiness, failure,
and a host of social problems. 3 The responsible citizen is
then tasked with the care and development of the brain, 4

increases in toxic hepatitis (liver inflammation).7 People
have also experienced argyria (blue or gray skin caused by
silver deposition) and other significant side effects from the
ingestion of silver, advertised as a cure-all. 8 Yet, consumer
demand for brain self-help products remains high and is
expected to continue to grow. Marketing rhetoric typically
attempts to convince self-help consumers that using these
products will allow them to outsmart their doctors, foil the
pharmaceutical industry, and provide them with risk-free
care and enhancement. 9 This situation is far from unique to
brain self-help products, but disorders of the brain are
common and costly, the level of misinformation and fervor
for the subject is high, and the sources of credible
information are difficult to locate and navigate.
In this paper I argue that the brain has risen to
prominence, that misinformation about the brain has
become rampant, and that this misinformation combines
with other factors and contributes to consumer
susceptibility to the aggressive and misleading marketing of
brain-themed products. In the sections that follow, I
consider the position of the consumer and protection
strategies as they currently exist and conclude with
recommendations to improve consumer information in the
belief that consumers can be trusted with their brains.

Attempts to facilitate progress in the area of brain
science began more than twenty years ago. President
George H. W. Bush proclaimed 1990 through 2000 to be the
Decade of the Brain, prioritizing brain research, enhancing
public awareness, and encouraging dialogue about emerging
discoveries.' 5 Major advances achieved during the Decade
of the Brain included recognition of the importance of
behavioral genetics,
development of brain-computer
interfaces, recognition of neurogenesis, and growth of
functional magnetic resonance imaging ("fMRI"). 16 Some
credit this as the time period in which mental illness
became recognized as a brain disorder. 17
Although not endorsed as such by the Clinton
Administration despite some bipartisan support, the
American Psychological Association, in collaboration with
more than thirty professional societies, proclaimed 2000
through 2010 to be the Decade of Behavior. This decade
focused on the role of behavioral and social science in
addressing societal challenges by "promoting a healthier
nation, a safer nation, a better educated nation."' 8 Lecture

Although bringing a novel point of view to a discussion may
be a reasonable journalistic goal, many scientific experts
fear that these misrepresentations of neuroscience may, in
fact, slow or stymie true innovation. 36
However, it would be an error to conclude that the
brain's prominence in popular culture arises only from
advocacy groups, the popular press and government
initiatives. 37 As innovation has proven difficult and public
funding for scientific innovation has plateaued or declined, 38
scientists have become increasingly responsible for
translating their work into public health outcomes and
generating money at increasingly early stages in the
scientific enterprise. 39 The use of persuasive discourse in
science has, therefore, become much more prevalent, and at

public about important progress in the area, 41 yet
frequently have little experience in public communication
and fear misrepresentation.42
Although scientists and journalists both search for truth
by analyzing facts, the level of certainty required and
means of expression of each are different. Media reporting
frequently proceeds from one big headline of an evolving
story to the next, while science proceeds incrementally, over
long periods of time, arriving at certainty well after the
novelty of the initial experiment.43 From the perspective of
the scientist, dissemination of new information to the public
should only occur after scientific goals have been achieved
and validated. The process of going from idea to theory to
fact is generally reserved for debate within the scientific
community.44 While scientists and journalists both value
being the first to discover something, they cope with it
differently. The journalist may value publishing novel, and
sometimes speculative, information in public outlets, while
the scientist copes by keeping findings private until there is
acknowledgement of discovery within the scientific
community.
The increase in the engagement and involvement of the
public facilitated by popular media may reflect a more
general trend toward democratization of neuroscience,
which potentially facilitates innovation.

participation in research design, and crowdsourcing. 45
These signs of a shift to a more open model of the practice of
science may result in the emergence of new mechanisms of
innovation, along with some likely errors along the way.
While some level of hype is a normal and expected part of
the development cycle of novel technologies, a middle
ground must be found between offering no opinions beyond
hard data and exaggerating facts to facilitate wild
predictions of an improbable future. Of particular concern
is the risk that hype "could result in either premature
translation of research or drive the market towards
providing unproven or potentially fraudulent treatments to
the public."46
So, what is new about neuroscience? Recent advances in
neuroscience bring together the concepts of mind and brain
in an unprecedented way. From a scientific standpoint, "the
brain is the organ of the mind."4 7 This understanding of
mind and brain in science dates back to the days of
48
Hippocrates and has been reiterated throughout history.
The scientific desire to localize the physical seat of the mind
or soul was largely met with frustration while scientists
could only explore the human brain after death and lacked
adequate animal models of emotion and cognition.
Mainstream science has embraced a view of the brain as
a unique, genetically active tissue that is constantly "on"
and multitasking during life. Just as there are no single
genes underlying complex biobehavioral disorders, there is
no single brain area devoted to complex cognition and
Modern neuroscience is really about
decision-making.

understanding and embracing complexity, not about
modular localization or simplification.
Innovations in neuroimaging have already facilitated a
greater understanding of the ways in which brain tumors,
injuries and illnesses change brain structure and function,
allowing clinicians and researchers to correlate self-reported
symptoms with observed areas of dysfunction or injury.
Neurosurgical planning is more precise than ever before,
and patients facing these procedures are provided with
more detailed education about what to expect.
In addition to understanding more about the brain by
studying brain illness and injury, researchers also study
variations in brain function in groups of healthy study
subjects reliably performing specific study procedures to
attempt to delineate mechanisms of physical brain function
with mental function. 49
fMRI studies combine
neuroimaging with behavioral tasks to make inferences
about differential activity in brain networks separating the
study from control groups. The researcher then has the
tasks of defining meaningful change and separating that
from random fluctuation within and between the study
groups. The researcher must then decide whether the
meaningful changes observed between groups may be
attributed to the performance of the task.
fMRI measures changes in blood flow and deoxygenated
hemoglobin in blood as it circulates through the physical
brain at rest and during performance of specified activities.
Researchers infer that a transient increase in blood flow
with increased concentrations of hemoglobin lacking oxygen

is an indication of neuronal oxygen use. Further,
researchers assume that neuronal communication accounts
for the perceived oxygen use. The area of change is then
identified as a bright spot. Interpretation of this signal is
made more difficult by stray signal or noise that may be
picked up during the detection of the signal of interest.
Thus, an experiment may be repeated several times in an
attempt to identify pertinent signal and separate it from
other activity and background noise.
Even with advanced resolution, these "bright spots,"
measured in voxels on a generated brain image, reflect the
function of thousands of neurons and millions of synapses
(i.e., connections). An active neuron may increase, inhibit,
or modulate regional activity consequently neuronal activity

communicate by electrical and chemical mechanisms, which
occur at generally faster rates (and thus over a shorter time
period) than blood flows and oxygen perfusion changes. In
order to further investigate these associations, some
research paradigms use both measures of fast-changing
brain cell electrical activity such as electroencephalography
(EEG) or magnetoencephelography (MEG) and slower
changing fMRI to study the complex and interconnected
communication systems of the brain. These networks are
always "on" and multitasking during life so a "bright spot"
is never the only functioning part of the brain, but rather it
is a rather large area that is statistically different from the
rest.
The fact that the technology has sufficiently progressed
so that researchers can see differential activity in a living
complex system is amazing, but the perception that these
technologies provide transparent windows into humanity
and behavior at the level of the individual is grossly
inaccurate.5 0 Brain function studies remain relatively gross
and indirect measures of how the physical brain works.

Similarly, performance on a study task provides incomplete
information about how people behave in real-world
situations.
Additionally, the data produced by these
technologies are remarkably complex and the analytic
procedures used to generate some of the commonly seen
pictures on the internet are based on a number of evolving
assumptions.
Consequently, drawing conclusions about
brain function in everyday life is fraught with difficulty.
The limitations of the science not withstanding, the
rhetorical brain is now not only seen as part of the body, but
as the seat of humanity (i.e. the individual's thoughts,
behaviors, feelings, and decisions).51 Although some worry
that an over-reliance on biological explanations of cognition
and emotion will lead to a devaluation of the human
experience, 52 others argue that the drive to know the brain
is fundamentally a human pursuit, adding complexity to
explanations of human experience and satisfying the human
being's deepest curiosity. 53
While it would be more
satisfying to believe that the increases in mentions of the
brain in communications and in the public's interest in the
brain is driven by a genuine interest in the richness of
neuroscientific data and the complexity of the human
experience, the reality seems to be that brain rhetoric
leverages biological supremacy to serve more proximate
goals such as improving the self, differentiating social
groups, making products more marketable, making
arguments more convincing, and making entertainment
more entertaining. 54

identifying the brain activity that is associated with
consumer preferences. 111 Neuromyths are perhaps an
expected side effect.
Neuromyths are false beliefs about brain function that
have become so common that they are no longer
questioned. 112 Sometimes the result of misinterpreted,
miscommunicated, or obsolete science, neuromyths tend to
be repetitive, simple, science-sounding statements that
make a case for a specific point of view, product or
approach. One common neuromyth is that people have
right-brain or left-brain personalities and/or learning styles.
The title Left-Brained Larry & Right-Brained Rachel, the
snowboarding movie Left Brain Right Brain, and the
Nintendo game Right Brain Left Brain all exploit this
common neuromyth.11 3 Another common misconception is
that people only use "about 10%" of the brain. The movie
Limitless used the neuromyth of untapped potential in the
fictional drug advertisement "Accessing 100% of your brain
is possible." 114 Regarding human development, a common
neuromyth is that there are windows or critical periods of
rapid learning followed by times in which new learning
cannot occur, leading people to sometimes expose babies to
swimming lessons, classical music, foreign languages and
mathematical concepts sometimes before they have the

Neuro self-help is yet another neuro. 115 Neuro self-help
products are those products made available directly to the
consumer to achieve desired "brain" outcomes for
themselves.
Neuromyths are frequently leveraged by
purveyors of neuroproducts in marketing materials, likely
due to the simplicity and seeming obviousness of them.
Neuro self-help, also referred to as "brain-based selfhelp,"116 puts forth the idea that brainpower is the key to
solving a problem or difficulty, frequently going on to assert
that increasing brainpower takes effort and new products.

A. The Market for Brain Self Help Products
While brain self-help products such as Brain Saltit7 have
been parts of our history, the market for these products has
experienced double-digit growth rates in recent years, 118
and most recently was estimated to be worth $11-12
billion. 119 The cognitive health food market is worth

another $1-2 billion.121 Although the traditional self-help
book and workshop market may be decreasing, 122 every
indication is that "functional foods" and brain-training
market shares are growing.123 Datamonitor predicts that
cognitive health foods will grow at more than 10%,
outstripping the growth rate of health foods in all other
categories.124 What follows is a brief overview of the kinds
of products available to consumers seeking brain selfimprovement.
Though the self-improvement movement has received
significant criticism, 125 many consider the drive for selfimprovement to be a fundamentally human endeavor.1 26
Self-care has long been part of our history, 127 and
healthcare officials point to consumer self-care as "an
important part of efficient and effective healthcare

combination of health literacy and actionable information,
self-management of health and wellness are net positives
for consumers. The important caveat is that many self-help
products make exaggerated or untested claims. 129 The
primary consumer goals for brain self-improvement are
rather difficult to quantify, but include self-mastery, selfinvention, effective competition, improved quality of life,
and emotional and physical security. 130
Popular discourse suggests that people must seek more
brainpower to be responsible citizens and that neuroscience
provides both accessible and actionable information to
empower the consumer to meet this responsibility. 13 1 Much
like attractiveness, it would seem that there is no such
thing as too much brainpower (or mental ability as defined
by one or more of the following: improved mood, higher
intelligence, more efficient organization, greater motivation,
intensified concentration, keener memory, increased
processing speed, or the heightened ability to perform a new
skill) and little objective way of quantifying it. Although
maintenance of wellness is frequently touted as a goal of
self-improvement, research has shown that those suffering
from mental health problems are more likely to turn to
complementary or alternative interventions such as those
offered by commercial self-improvement products.1 32

out of the enterprise of brain monitoring, training and

V. BRAIN SELF-HELP CONSUMERS AND CONSUMER
PROTECTION

Although brain themed products are common, not all
brain themed products are brain self-help products.
Examples of brain themed products that would not be
considered self-help products include technologies using a
simplistic brain computer interface to guide figures in a
video game or control a mobile device. Similarly, using
brainwaves for matchmaking would not be a brain self-help
product. 169 Though likely perceived of as more credible than
they are to consumers owing to neuromyths, these products
do not claim to alter brain function or improve the brain.
The focus of this discussion is on technologies making
brain improvement claims. Examples include devices that
encourage consumers to visualize brain waves and draw
conclusions about mental states. Brain exercising games
propagate the brain-as-muscle neuromyth and make claims
of improving memory, cognition, decision-making, and
behavior due to alteration in brain function. These, along

cereals claiming cognitive enhancement,1 74 weeds found in
herbal supplements, 75 and deaths following use of energy
drinks marketed to the young are but a few examples of
how this proverbial safety net fails to meet consumer
expectations of protection. 176 The reality is that the
individual consumer is responsible for discovering and
weighing risks and benefits associated with the use of the
products because investigations occur after reports of
dissatisfaction or adverse events.

technology.179 This tie between implied health information
and brain products allegedly "not designed or intended to
diagnose or treat health problems" is not subtle. When
looking at credible sources of consumer friendly brain
information, the Dana Foundation brain health information
did not appear until the third search screen, the first result
referencing the National Institutes of Health was on the
fifth page of search results, and the first Centers for Disease
Control reference was on the seventh page of search results.
The vast majority of the initial 100 search results were for
various commercial brain self-help products.

A. Why Protect the Brain Self-Help Consumer?
To the degree that the rational consumer has a selfidentified need that an available technology can meet,
understands the technology and its risks, has access to the
technology, is prepared for the associated outcomes and has
the resources to buy the product, a consumer rights model
would suggest that he or she should be able to do so with
the comfort that marketplace regulation will provide fair
competition and the free flow of truthful information in the
marketplace.1 80
Behavioral economics suggests that consumers are
however not always rational actors.1 81 Consumers may be
vulnerable as the result of temporary or permanent
individual life circumstances such as youth, illness,
infirmity, and illiteracy.182 As previously noted, people in
distress and those with mental illness were more likely to
seek alternative therapies, and thus there are particular
areas of concern around brain self-help. Market factors

such as information asymmetry, supplier exploitation, and
complex products may contribute to consumer vulnerability,
as can limitations in environments and alternative products
and services. 183 Social factors such as exclusion and
isolation may also increase consumer vulnerability. 18 4 Even
consumers who might not otherwise be considered
vulnerable respond to group pressure, suggestion, and
faulty cause and effect associations seen in many
advertisements.
Although there is a strong desire for science and health
news, both scientific and health literacy have been
identified as major challenges facing U.S. consumers. 185
Trust appears to play at least as prominent a role as factual
knowledge in public understanding and acceptance of novel
technologies. 186 Studies have also indicated that consumers
were easily misled by neuroscience jargon, elaborate brain
pictures, and reductionistic explanations. 187 Consumers
also tend to approve of perceived medical uses of
neuroscientific technologies 188 and may be relatively less
critical when products appear to be health products.
Further, consumers tend toward products that promise
them "real" change with a minimum of effort and

convenience factor is well known to marketers.18 9
In the age of neuromania, or neurohype, misinformation
about brain science comes from news reporting,
entertainment, testimonials, and blogs in addition to
product placements and advertisements. While not unique
to neuroscience, false positive study results abound, and
little explication of study design and limitations is seen in
the popular media. 190 Thus, the reliable information
available to even the savviest of consumers is limited.

overly optimistic. 191 Just as trust plays a significant role in

unaware of the degree to which there is purposeful
exploitation of their biases. 192 For instance, there is a
strong tendency for people to accept things when told that
many other people accept them, so advertisers may well use
language to suggest that product use or benefit is occurring
in large groups of people. People also tend to identify with
other people like them in some ways so testimonials may be
used to facilitate this identification. 193 There are also

tendencies to draw similarities between imagined and
actual experiences, particularly those events occurring
proximate in time, so advertising language is frequently
broad and descriptive of common events. As brain images
and scientific language become increasingly prevalent in
news and entertainment, commercial vendors may borrow
this language to engender trust and familiarity.
Consumers frequently assume that knowledge gained
from the news media, combined with marketplace
assurances of product safety and provision of sound
information, provide a basis on which to make brain selfhelp product decisions. 194 Not unsurprisingly, studies
confirm that media reporting "moderates differences
between the public and experts" regarding appropriate uses
of brain technologies. 195
There are also no easily
identifiable major aggregators of consumer feedback
regarding brain self-improvement products or of balanced
research findings related to these products to assist the
consumer who might search for information about them.
Consumers do not tend to reason that any and all
interactions with the environment change blood flow and
brain activity on a continuous basis, so claims about a
product changing the brain do not appear as obviously
flawed, or even comical, to the casual consumer as they
frequently do to practitioners and scientists. Although

At its best, marketing has the goal of matching safe and
effective products with the consumer seeking them.
However, manipulative advertising and disease mongering
are also real phenomena. 197 Consumers may be influenced
by suggestions of a starting point for their thoughts about a

occurrences, framing effects, appeals to loss aversion, and
pointing to similar (even if infrequent) situations.198 For

normal variations in function as indications of disease or
The

advertisements then typically ascribe negative emotion or
suffering to this state of less than optimal functioning.
Manipulative advertisers may also misuse statistics to
exaggerate frequency of the need. 200 The advertisements
then go on to idealize product effects, set vague endpoints
for product use, and tell the consumer that he or she will
function at a higher level if this need (dysfunction,
difficulty, or disease) is corrected. This type of manipulative
disease
advertising is sometimes referred to as
mongering. 201 Manipulative advertising underestimates

risk of the proposed product, overestimates value to the
individual, changes how consumers frame their problems,
and shifts how they see the range of potential answers. 202
Pointing out to the consumer what has happened and
providing alternative sources of information are successful
ways of responding to these common areas of misperception
and can improve decision making substantially. 20 3
The risks to consumers posed by these products range
from obvious physical injury by ingesting novel substances
or applying electrical current to the brain, to the more
subtle loss of opportunity harms (i.e. diversion of time and
resources from activities that are more likely to be
beneficial to the consumer). Although the weighing of cost
and benefit and safety and efficacy belongs to the consumer
using these self-improvement products, when claims of
brain manipulation are made, there are additional concerns
about efficacy and reliability of the information and product.
B. Examples of Information Offered to Consumers
In the section that follows, brain self-help technology
websites were reviewed and quotations have been excerpted
to demonstrate the information that consumers are often
faced with when searching for and making decisions about
brain self-help products.
A popular website 204 lists many untested or unproven
self-improvement modalities for brain health and cognitive
enhancement clothed in the language of health and science,
including books and tapes, supplements, cranial electrical
stimulation ("CES") devices, light and sound machines,
home EEG and biofeedback devices, and colloidal silver
generators that will enable the consumer to "take control of

Vol. 11:2

your physical and mental health."205 The website material
reflected an overt attempt to facilitate consumer trust in the
products by attempting to ground them in science,
indicating that the company "has evolved as the result of
over 30 years of research." The supplier further claimed
that products were "personally tested and researched" 206
implying both safety and efficacy. And most directly the
advertising suggested that the consumer "will find products
207
that go beyond simple maintenance and quick 'cures,"'
implying a categorical separation between the listed
products and all others.
Under the cranial electrical stimulation category, the
website proclaims, "Stress is our nation's #1 health problem.
It is the source of the anxiety, depression, and insomnia
plaguing millions of Americans. Stress accounts for more
than two-thirds of family doctor visits and is an important
risk factor in all major illnesses. Left unchecked, it is a
killer." 208 These are examples of enhancing frequency
statistics, pathologizing common and poorly described
mental states, and catastrophizing a lack of attention to the
identified common severe impairment.
Although the disclaimer language later indicates that
these are not health claims, the remainder of messages on
the website clearly surround brain manipulation. Unlike
the product marketing language expressed in plain
language, placed in the center of the page and in large
attractive font, the terms of use are located in a rather
inconspicuous place on the website and are introduced as
follows: "Please read the legalese about the limits of our
liability and your responsibility for using experimental
healing modalities." 2 09 The term legalese is defined by
Miriam Webster dictionary as "the language used by
lawyers that is difficult for most people to understand" and

"specialized language of the legal profession." 210 The very
use of this word seems to indicate that the advertiser
specifically made the information obtuse. This designation
of the language as difficult or foreign to the consumer tends
to separate the consumer from the very systems seeking to
protect him or her and is in distinct contrast to the
consumer-friendly language about the product.
The
placement and use of language both appear to be obvious
attempts to dissuade the consumer from reading and
considering the material. This is an example of a framing
effect.
The disclosures then explicitly paint the product
information offered as educational and recreational,
The information provided by ELIXA.COM is

engaged in providing medical or professional

medical consultations with a qualified health

The concept that this is education and entertainment
should be rejected out of hand as patently disingenuous
given the remainder of the material contained in the
website.
Examples of specific health claims include
"Cranial Electrical Stimulation for mood, IQ, addictions." 212

would enhance cognition and memory, elevate mood, and
stabilize sleep. The mind machine is a bit more suggestive,
orienting the consumer with the statement, "Our Mind
Machines will make you smarter, more productive, happier,
relaxed, and 'in the zone."' 213 The website then offers this
quotation from a book that demonstrates suggestion,
framing, promise of biological change, subjective criteria for
measuring improvement, and reference to increasing
numbers of people using the technology:
You sit down comfortably, don the electrical headgear,

benefits of products, it does not contain warning letters or
critiques of its products, including the ingestion of colloidal
silver allegedly made from generators. 216 In fact, it goes so
far as to say why argyria (skin turning blue due to silver
ingestion) will not occur. 217 Other undisclosed harms of
silver ingestion include kidney damage and neurological
problems such as seizures. The FDA published position
excerpted below is unlikely to come to the attention of the
average consumer using this website as it is absent from the
product website and not prominent in any consumer forum:
Silver is present in the environment, and
therefore people are normally exposed to it.
However, silver is a nonessential mineral that
has no known physiological functions or
benefits when taken orally.
Silver has some appropriate medical uses,
such as medicines, bandages, and dressings
used to treat burns, skin wounds, or skin

In this example, the alleged health benefits were described
over many pages, disclosures were not present, and adverse
effects were not mentioned anywhere. Regardless of the
status of product purveyors as health providers, the
disclosure of risk in the face of claimed benefit is a
responsibility the marketer bears with regard to the
consumer.
In addition to disingenuous and incomplete content,
negative framing language, and inconspicuous placement,
these disclosures are also frequently presented to
consumers in ways that make them unlikely to be noticed or
read by the consumer. The disclosure in Figure 1 features
small font, poor resolution, inconspicuous location, and a
message that is inconsistent with the rest of the site. These
qualities make the information less likely to be viewed by

they are not effective consumer information and do little to
correct the informational asymmetry between the consumer,
actual state of the science, and claims of the manufacturer
or marketer.
C. EnhancingConsumerLiteracy
Although product information, disclaimers, labels, and
instructions are considered by many to be among the most
important sources of consumer education, the reality is that
this product information is often difficult to understand
owing to the brevity of the information provided, lack of
contextual data, complex names, and terms and large
amount of distracting general information. These features
may cause consumers to overlook this information. There
are also varying rules and regulations that detail how much
information needs to be provided so that the idea of
complete disclosure is more myth than reality.
In addition to product information provided directly to
the individual consumer, consumer watch groups have a
role to play in informing and empowering consumers by
providing credible information and reviews. Since trust is a
prominent factor in both interpretation of the science and in
product selection, third party consumer watch groups may
have a strong role to play in improving knowledge and
therefore more advantageous product selection by
consumers. The National Consumers League is a private

does not appear to list many brain self-improvement

other hand, is a website that reviews products and claims in

conducive to consumer access. Regarding brain health and
product information, Consumer Health and Human
Services Information and Resources and the Consumer
Information Center are no better. 229 Similarly, the National
Institutes of Health offer information
sites and

but are difficult to navigate, often fail to speak to specific
brands of products and point to references that are not
accessible to the average consumer. Consequently, some of

the agencies likely to engender the highest levels of
consumer trust also pass the highest information costs on to
consumers by devising information sources that are not
particularly user friendly.
Even when information is available, increasing scientific
and health literacy will be one important step in helping the
consumer become savvier regarding brain products. While
compulsory public education is a good start, many advances
will occur following the consumer's exit from formal
education, and students frequently leave school without the
skills necessary to understand these advances. At present,
functional neuroimaging does allow researchers and
clinicians to peer inside the skull and observe the living
human's brain activity. However, the massive amounts of
data produced are interpreted and reduced to pictures using
complex statistical methods that are based on both a variety
of assumptions and the nature of the research question
asked. There is nothing simple or straightforward about

In building scientific literacy, scientific reporting will
need to be more thorough and include disclosures when
appropriate. In addition to identifying the limitations of the
technology generally, there are study-specific issues of
which consumers should be made aware including small
sample size, uncontrolled multiple comparisons, overinterpretation of the data, findings of uncertain
significance, and indications of premature or biased
reporting. As consumers become aware of these factors it
will become more difficult for commercial entities to
leverage the brain image and the rhetorical brain construct
to induce certainty about things in which there is none. As
scientific literacy improves, individuals may also more
accurately assess privacy concerns related to neuroimaging
databases by being better able to differentiate valid versus

535

faulty inferences about internal mental states derived from
brain images. 230
With improvements in consumer understanding of the
technologies and studies and advances in the technologies
themselves, communications to consumers via the media or
regulation may begin to shift from a threshold kind of
communication (i.e. whether a product could actually do
what it purports) to more nuanced conceptualizations of
risk-benefit and cost-value analyses. Many information
websites that might rightfully garner consumer trust are
simply not user-friendly. They are not keyed to find the
terms consumers search for, are difficult to navigate, and
are frequently not engaging in their presentation. Product
placements in commercial websites are, in fact, engaging,
accessible, and persuasive.
While there are on-going
attempts to make balanced consumer education more
engaging, this work is in its relative infancy and only likely
to be of benefit to future consumers.
Accepting that consumers consider most brain and brain
product stories and advertisements to be health information
at some level, is there a role for traditional healthcare
systems in enhancing consumer literacy? Most of the people
who used the internet to search for health information also
"got information, care, or support from a doctor or other
healthcare professional," 231 indicating that there is an
opportunity for the traditional health system to provide
information about the brain and brain products to the
consumer.
Some have pointed to the provider-patient
relationship as "a reservoir of solutions to the challenges
created by unproven interventions and translational
research." 232 Yet, there is a move in healthcare to decrease
reliance on routine health checks by physicians and other

no

With few exceptions, scientific groups and organizations
have been relatively uninvolved in correcting public
perception 236 and limiting commercial brain self-help
technologies. Some observers, in fact, blame both clinicians
and scientists for shirking their responsibilities to the
public by allowing their findings to be skewed in the
popular media. A notable exception is an expert consensus
panel that recommended consumers (1) look for products
that can substantiate the claims made with independent
verification, (2) separate items founded on plausible
reasoning from those that have actually been tested, (3) not
mistake improvement in a concrete task with global
cognitive improvement, (4) consider that short-term
improvement
may
not
translate
into
long-term
improvements, and (5) consider traditional activities that
also result in cognitive improvement such as, for example,
physical exercise, socializing with others, or learning a new
life skill. 2 3 7 Though it is not popularized, this panel report
is a promising attempt to provide direct actionable
information to consumers.

powerful products with the ability to change their brains yet
escape the formal regulation accompanying traditional
diagnostic and therapeutic modalities making similar
claims. These products seem to put forth claims that they
change physical brain activity without having to disclose
that everything a person does changes brain activity and
without any particular demonstration of concept. 238
Sometimes these products are based on a shred of truth, or
novel application of plausible biological principles, but at
other times they seem based on neuromyth or sheer fantasy.
The inability (or unwillingness) of commercial interests,
consumer watch groups, and science watch groups to
provide accessible information to consumers on which they
could differentiate valid, potentially valid, and unlikely
valid claims may be conceptualized as a market failure. As
one observer noted, "When markets don't provide consumers
with the information they need to make good decisions, the
markets have failed, and policy makers need to take steps to
make sure consumers get such information."239
If the use of these self-help products is considered a
hobby or recreational pastime, then the risk disclosure
alone would be adequate, and further use would presumably
be driven by the pleasure derived from its use. Although it
would be convenient for industry to conceptualize that these
technologies are recreational, available evidence suggests
that brain self-help advertisements make health claims and
consumers turn to these technologies for health-related
concerns, so it is reasonable to conceptualize these health
products falling under the FDA and FTC regulatory
authority.
When costs and risks are relatively low, these products
might seem harmless and mistakes in using them could be
subsumed under a kind of consumer naivet6 that will

benefit from one trial of falling for an ineffective claim.

However, this assumes a healthy, and well-informed,
consumer acting on his or her own behalf, and that it is not
uniformly the consumer that seeks and uses online health
information such as that put forward in brain self-help.
Additionally, the advertisements tend to appeal to parents
to use these products on their children and to individuals at
risk for cognitive decline, so the well, young-adult consumer
acting to fine tune his or her own body is only a portion of
the market.
Brain-themed self-improvement materials such as books,
recordings, games and apps would generally fall into the
category of low-risk and-low cost endeavors that seem to
attract a minimum of regulatory attention.
When
considering foods, supplements and devices for brain health
and manipulation, public and private regulation becomes
more complex with substantive regulation dealing with
basic safety data and claims made. In situations in which
physical risk remains relatively low, these more complex
regulations provide a more minimal safety net than
consumers assume and are perhaps no more useful to
consumers than labels and disclaimers.

A. Self-Regulation and Soft Law
In an ideal world, self-regulation would rule the day. 2 40
The arguments for self-regulation center around the idea
that involvement in the enterprise is voluntary and that it
is good business for producers to do adequate research
before developing a product to make certain that it is
effective, to produce a quality product, and then to stand
behind that product, else risk losing market share. 241

Vol. 11:2

Additionally, self-regulation is nimble and prompt in
responding to problems experienced in the marketplace. 242
Proponents will go on to argue that common law
mechanisms exist for fraud and injury, and that those
should be sufficient for consumer protection. Voluntary
self-regulation is pitched as cost-effective and good for
everyone. 243 Corporate codes of conduct and internal
reviews are examples of self-regulation at the level of the
single business. 244 An example of self-regulation in a larger
corporate ecosystem is the Advertising Self-Regulatory
Council administered by the Council of Better Business
Bureaus. 245
In addition to internal self-regulation, companies may
also voluntarily submit their products to private groups for
review by agents external to the company. Underwriters
Laboratories is one such company. It was established in
1894,246 to ensure safety of devices, but does not assess the
validity of claims made by the device. For example, some
consumer cranial electrical stimulation devices carry the
following designation: "Medical Electrical Equipment
classified by Underwriters Laboratories Inc.@ with respect
to electric shock, fire, mechanical and other specified
hazards only in accordance with UL-2601-1 and CAN/CSA
C22.2 No. 601.1. 34VF." 2 47 The Underwriters Laboratories
approval carries weight with consumers as a signal of
overall product safety and quality despite the fact that this

approval only pertains to physical risk and not to claims
made.
B. DirectRegulation
Informed and useful regulation must balance consumer
desires for new information and products with product
safety and reasonable controls on claims made. Command
and control regulation may have an advantage over selfregulation in including multiple points of view, not relying
on volunteerism, and having the ability to impose sanctions
and demand withdrawal of the product or the claim from
the marketplace. 248 Of course, opponents claim that
command and control mechanisms risk slowing innovation,
while proponents claim that these types of protections are
essential for the protection of the public.
While far from the only regulatory mechanisms
applicable to brain self-improvement products, 249 the two
command and control mechanisms that will be considered
here are the FTC and FDA.
The FTC, 2 50 via its Bureau of Consumer Protection, is
tasked with the prevention of fraud, deception, unfair
business practices, and provision of free consumer
information. 251 The FTC covers advertising of over the
counter medications, foods and devices. Section 45 of the
Federal Trade Commission Act gives the FTC power to

investigate unfair and deceptive acts or practices including
the omission of information material to a consumer's
choice. 252 Upon a finding of unfair or deceptive practices,
the FTC may issue a cease and desist order and leverage
penalties for violations, 253 such as when Kellogg advertised
that Mini-Wheats improve attention. 254
The FDA regulates the advertising of prescription drugs
and restricted devices and handles misbranding and
labeling issues. 255 In drugs and restricted devices, products
regulated are those products intended to diagnose, cure,
prevent or treat disease or intended to affect the structure
or function of the body. 256 Where printed materials or
websites make certain health claims, the FDA may become
involved, most commonly issuing warning letters. 257
The FDA also regulates health claims made by foods and
supplements. A health claim occurs when there is a stated
relationship between the food or supplement, or a
component, and reduced risk of a disease or health
condition. Although the term "functional" is sometimes
foods and dietary ingredients making health claims beyond
general nutrition, the term has no legal definition and is not
under a separate regulatory scheme. The FDA, instead,
regulates these products using the existing food regulatory
scheme consisting of foods (conventional, modified or
medical), food additives and dietary supplements, a system

characterized by some as having arbitrary loopholes and
inadequate enforcement strategies. 25 8
More highly regulated would be devices that monitor or
effect change in human physiology. 259 Devices such as home
neurofeedback devices and "brain wave synchronizers" 260
might well fall under the jurisdiction of the FDA. However,
as a natural consequence of the brain's rock star status,
brain self-help products have grown in prominence, and
regulation around claims made by individuals not directly
involved in manufacturing and supplying products are
unclear. 26 1
C CES Devices:An Example ofRegulation and
Enforcement
Cranial electrotherapy stimulation ("CES") devices use
low intensity electrical stimulation, usually delivered
through ear clips or electrodes in the head and neck area, to
treat anxiety, depression, and insomnia. The devices are
classified as experimental. Examining the challenge posed
by these devices to regulatory systems may be instructive
because it is an area in which the FDA has made significant
attempts to curb excessive claims and examine the risk
benefit analysis. 262

Vol. 11:2

Though this kind of therapy likely has its origins in
studies conducted in the eighteenth century, efficacy has yet
to be established in adequately powered controlled clinical
trials. This example is particularly relevant because many
observers predict that the next wave of treatments for
in the area of
will be
disorders
biobehavioral
will be faced
consumer
neuromodulation, and, thus, the
with hearing about the likely successes of clinical
neuromodulation and having to figure out whether
consumer level devices are sufficiently similar to clinically
available ones to be of use or are sufficiently different and to
be avoided.
In the late 1970s, the FDA placed these devices in Class
III owing to the lack of convincing data demonstrating
benefit. The placement in Class III triggers the FDA's most
stringent application process for premarket approval
("PMA") of devices. In 1997, the PlIA requirement was
revoked, and the FDA considered a move to Class I or II,
inviting device manufacturers to submit evidence of safety
and efficacy.
In 2009, the FDA obtained additional information from
manufacturers and in 2011 published a proposed rule to
again require premarket approval for CES devices. In 2012,
the FDA's Neurological Devices Panel met and came to the
decision and concluded that Class III placement with a
PMA requirement was appropriate. During the time in
which these devices could enter the market without PMA,
device suppliers entered the market making claims that
devices were FDA approved or cleared for the advertised
purposes that usually extended well beyond the three
indications for which the device had actually been cleared.
One CES device manufacturer in particular has been vocal
about FDA action requiring premarket approval for claims
made. It initially claimed that the product was FDAapproved for a number of indications. The labeling was
then changed to indicate it was FDA-regulated. When the
FDA reinstated the PlVIA requirement, the manufacturer

then went on the offensive claiming that the FDA was
stalling the process and depriving consumers of technologies
that the government itself is using. 2 63
EPI's largest customer is currently the United
States government, and preventing the
marketing of Alpha-Stim@ would deprive our
Soldiers and Veterans of an effective tool in
their battle against insomnia, anxiety,
depression and PTSD. Ironically, while one
branch of government (FDA) is attempting to
justify spending millions of dollars to prevent
the marketing of CES, other branches (the
DOD and VA) are spending millions of dollars
purchasing Alpha-Stim@ CES and on research
to study the effects of Alpha-Stim@ CES on
our Soldiers and Veterans. 264
The document ends with a call to action "EPI is asking that
you simply tell FDA the truth about how safe and effective
CES is for you and/or your patients. EPI will deal directly
with the issues in the Proposed Rule." 2 6 5 EPI also refers to
itself as the most regulated company in the United States
and has links to alleged improper behavior by the FDA.
In the midst of these machinations, it is not at all clear
that consumers understand the differences between terms
like FDA-approved, -cleared, -regulated, and -allowed, so
the supplier of the technology is able to sustain the
appearance of governmental testing of efficacy when, in
fact, the product may be regulated due to a lack of efficacy

266 While
combined with an unacceptable risk of side effect.
technically true, this is misleading: "CES in the United
States has received Food and Drug Administration
marketing clearance for the treatment of anxiety,
depression, and insomnia. CES devices are sold over the
counter in Europe and other parts of the world." 2 67 Again,
this is an example of appealing to potential consumer biases
by framing the technology as safe and effective and
suggesting that the rest of the world uses it without
government interference.
It is not difficult to conceptualize potentially informative
text about these issues. Consider these two examples: "FDA
believes that the available scientific evidence supports a
Class III determination because the data do not support a
reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, the
proposed special controls would be insufficient to provide
such assurance, and there is an unreasonable risk of illness
or injury,"268 or, even more simply phrased, "the suppliers of
this device have not demonstrated effectiveness and safety
so the FDA does not recommend, approve, or condone its
use for any purpose."
The FDA has, in fact, made attempts to limit the claims
made by Alpha-Stim, Health Directions, and others. 269

However, on the most recent visit to the Alpha-Stim website
this statement appeared: "Alpha-Stim is FDA Approved and
can only be purchased with a prescription. To discuss your
Alpha-Stim needs with Dr. James G. Friesen please call
(818) 893-4463 and leave him a message." 270 This clinical
psychologist goes on to say, "Should you consider
purchasing one, you will be pleased to know that AlphaStim is FDA approved and that no significant side effects
have been reported in over two decades of use. The price is
$795, and that includes a five-year warranty."27 1 He then
says,
I believe it is unethical for therapists not to try
using Alpha-Stim.
Here is the point: If
therapists know that something may help
their patients and yet they refuse to try it,
that is unethical. These are not simply "initial
findings" - we have over [fifty] scientific
studies
that
support
these
clinical
observations. After continuing treatment with
about [one hundred] people in therapy for over
three years, I believe that my initial findings
are supported by what my patients continue to
report. Therapists are mandated to continue
to learn about interventions that can help
their patients, so if Alpha-Stim may help,
therapists cannot afford to ignore that. 272

problems of professionals offering testimonials and making
claims without apparent concern for action by regulatory
authorities. By having an appointed practitioner offer

professional opinions and provide prescriptions, these
companies work around any opportunity for consultative
involvement by traditional healthcare outlets that could
provide balanced and personalized information to the
consumer.
While it might be reassuring from a physical safety
perspective that the product price is clearly advertised, that
it comes with a warranty and that it is not considered a
shock risk, the ongoing marketing material suggesting that
the device is FDA-approved, and the continued mentions of
addiction and pain management, in addition to anxiety,
depression and insomnia, are clearly inconsistent with the
content of communications from the FDA.
Other suppliers market CES devices in a similar
manner. Healthpax, for instance, markets the CES Ultra as
enhancing "relaxed awareness, cognitive function, mental
performance, memory and I.Q." Although it does not claim
to be FDA-approved, Healthpax lists the device as having
an FDA registration number in a prominent place on the
website, differentiating itself from other CES devices.
Quackwatch published a review of these technologies
several years ago, last revised January 20, 2008, including
links to the FDA warning letters from 2004 for implied
claims and recall from 2007 for peak voltage test difficulties,
yet the technology continues to be advertised. 273
If a hazard threshold for regulation is the accepted
threshold, 274 then relative neglect in this area is to be
accepted for products that pose little direct risk. But as
these technologies improve, it is likely that these products

will become more effective, and pose more subtle risks than
electrocution by the battery operated CES device or turning
blue from silver exposure.
A question raised by this
scenario is whether a more nuanced view of regulation, such
as one informed by novelty of the claim rather than specific
hazard of the device, should be the threshold for a
requirement of findings of efficacy and risk prior to
marketing. 275 While the FDA and FTC likely lack the
resources to carry out such an expanded mission,
transparency to the consumer about what they do and do
not regulate would be within their means and a step in the
right direction.
Perhaps it is unreasonable to charge agencies already
burdened
by
substantive
regulation
(i.e. product
authenticity and safety) to regulate messages as well. 2 76
While risking slower innovation, in the area of selfimprovement technologies making health claims, there are
perhaps some keyworded messages that should trigger
demonstration of safety and efficacy before being made
available in the marketplace.
Given that there are
currently no uniform definitions of brain health and brain
fitness, defining these terms and developing scientifically
based standards for consumer application would seem a
reasonable place to begin. 277
What is likely to be more effective is improving
consumer ability to evaluate claims made through more
accessible and actionable information, be it through
government websites, professional organization statements,
or personal healthcare practitioners. In framing that which
is normal, providing realistic information about the broad
range of normal, providing credible and balanced
information, and forcing the comparisons between new
technologies and proven techniques to maintain health, we
could potentially decrease consumer demand for these

speculative products, increase consumer sophistication, and
therefore encourage the exit of untested products making
unproven claims from the marketplace. Policy makers may
also consider strategies that structure consumer choice,
designate choice architects or nudge consumers toward
better decisions. 278 To this end, policymakers may need to
consider both increasing the persuasive power of credible
information and limiting the persuasive powers of entities
attempting to provide unproven products.
VII. CONCLUSION
The collective fascination with brains as the basis of
behavior is second only to the lack of working knowledge
about them. Progress, such as that promised by the Human
Connectome Project and BRAIN, could do much to decrease
consumer frustration and desperation that may increase the
probability of turning to brain self-help products. In the
interim, it is reasonable to predict that reporting related to
these initiatives will contribute to ongoing public
preoccupation with the brain.
Scientific discovery is big news. At a number of levels,
public engagement is a driver of the discovery process.
Researchers may have been passive conveyers of
experimental results in times past, but, currently, there are
increasing calls for scientists to anticipate potential
applications or extensions of their work and welcome a
dialogue that may influence the scientist's study design and
help the scientist frame results in a way that minimizes the
risk of distortion. 279 How willing news outlets and other
popular media are to be the vehicle of this discussion is a
variable that has yet to be investigated.
Message matters. The brain is the current metaphor for
humanity or personhood, and this rhetoric cannot be
ignored or minimized; it must be managed. The brain is

truly not like any other organ in the body and it is humbling
to continue to learn that on a daily basis. Research in the
area needs to continue to mature in order to provide quality
consumer information.
Currently, most brain function
studies are relatively small studies of association, yet the
information considered most reliable for consumers would
likely come from large prospective studies from which
causation might be inferred.
Scientists, journalists, clinicians and experts of all types
have a responsibility to communicate brain-science findings
to the public using clear and accurate language. While the
usually conservative and conditioned language of science is
not the stuff of great headlines or sound bites, to do
otherwise is a disservice to the public, the science and the
professions. Enhancing consumer safety will likely involve
some level of self-regulation of claims by scientists,
journalists, and commercial entities.
Amongst the
information offered to consumers should be mandatory
disclosure of whether, and how, the technology in question
changes brain function when compared to traditional
activities used to achieve the same results such as exercise.
Even in minimal risk claims, some kind of proof of efficacy
and screening of products making brain claims on a
premarket basis should be undertaken because of the
amount of current misinformation, rhetorical power of brain
images, number of products being introduced, and prior
abuses. Errors affecting the brain could be costly and
difficult to correct as this complex system is poorly
understood at best. The risk-benefit analysis will, almost by
definition, be incomplete. The information that consumers
need in order to make better decisions includes the high
level of complexity of brain science, limitations of both
science and current products, and a frame for
understanding the wide range of normal brain function. In
prior studies, showing consumers realistic information and
pointing out common mistaken biases resulted in improved
decision making.
Leaving consumers with the notion that a brain that
"lights up" is human, and one that does not is somehow less
than human, is neither accurate nor useful. As a derivative,

552

INDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW

Vol. 11:2

placing a burden on consumers to maximize their brains or
fall ill ignores the realities that illness may occur no matter
how "fit" a brain is, and decisions made about the
expenditure of brainpower are likely more important than
how much power brains generate. Everything is a trade off.
Perhaps mandatory funding of independent studies and
consumer education programs by brain self-improvement
product authors, marketers, suppliers, manufacturers, and
producers would be an important first step in being
accountable to the public for claims made. It could result in
real changes within the industries involved and provide
ideas, data, or models for meaningful regulation.
The lack of objective benchmarks for the outcomes of
interest to consumers in brain science makes it difficult to
evaluate claims and outcomes. Regulation in the face of
this level of scientific indeterminacy is no easy matter, but
providing credible and balanced information in an
accessible fashion and barring the frankly preposterous
claim should be at least tentative goals. In short, we can
trust the informed consumer with his or her brain if we
provide accessible, credible, understandable, and, where
appropriate, actionable information that is consistent across
news, entertainment, and self-help outlets.
