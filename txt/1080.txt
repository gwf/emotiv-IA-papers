Abstract
We present results from an EEG experiment EEG to measure neurophysiological activation to
study novice and experienced designers when designing and problem-solving. We adopted and
extended the tasks described in a previous fMRI study. The block experiment consists of 3 tasks:
problem-solving, basic design, and open layout design. The block is preceded by a familiarizing
pre-task and extended to an open design sketching task. Results from 36 sessions of mechanical
engineers and industrial designers indicate significant differences in activations between the
problem-solving and the design tasks.
Keywords: design science, problem solving, novices, experienced, design thinking

1. Introduction
Studies of the cognitive behavior of novice and experienced designers have been mainly based on
methods from cognitive psychology, such as protocol analysis (Crutcher, 1994; Ericsson and Simon,
1984; Kan and Gero, 2017). The overlapping of the terms expert and experienced has populated design
research as well. The term expert (Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1988) is attributed to people that have an inherent
know-how to do things, and as a stage of possible attainment for others. Expert’s cognitive activity and
productivity is almost three times as high as the novice’s in terms of image generation (Kavakli and Gero,
2002). Their cognitive actions are well organized and clearly structured, while the novice’s cognitive
performance is divided into groups of concurrent actions (Kavakli and Gero, 2002). Experts and novices’
performance differ in terms of their respective strategic knowledge. Experts are known for taking a
systemic view of the design situation, framing the problem in a challenging way, and drawing upon first
principles to guide the overall concept and detailed design (Cross and Clayburn Cross, 1998).
Results from the study of freshman and senior designers show that the latter produce higher quality
solutions, spend more time solving the problem, consider alternative solutions and make more transitions
between design steps than freshmen (Atman et al., 1999). The novice designers tended to use a particular
pattern of trial and error. Experienced designers used particular design strategies. Experienced designers
tend to combine between three to five activities before changing their approach to a particular problem
and develop individual approaches to a design task. Individual approaches seem to be dependent on the
type of design task (conceptual versus detail design) and also on age and experience (Ahmed et al., 2003).

Experienced designers demonstrate more schema-driven than case-driven analogical reasoning, whilst
novices show the reverse pattern of analogising (Ball et al., 2004) and can be distinguished by the way
they decompose a problem (Ho, 2001). How novices and experienced designers design and shape
products is still underexplored (Jagtag, 2018). Such single-domain studies based on architecture (Kavakli
and Gero, 2002), engineering design (Cross and Clayburn Cross, 1998; Atman et al., 1999; Ahmed et al.,
2003; Ball et al., 2004) and industrial design (Ho, 2001; Jagtag, 2018) provide insights on how novices
and experienced professionals design within a domain.
However, the emergent conceptual move towards understanding the cognitive mechanisms of designing,
through the use of methods from the neurosciences provide the means to investigate how designers
change with experience and how this translates into neurophysiological activation. This opens the way to
identify the drivers and triggers of change in design with implications for design education and design
process modelling, in particular if correlated with protocol studies. Neurophysiological measurements
offer a window to explore how these aspects unfold over time.
The research reported in this paper examines the neurophysiological activations throughout constrained
and open design tasks performed by novice and experienced professionals from the domains of
mechanical engineering and industrial design. We study how problem-solving and designing cognitive
processes unfold and translate into neurophysiological activations. We describe preliminary results from
a controlled experiment in which, by taking advantage of the temporal resolution of electroencephalography (EEG) and the use of low-cost portable equipment, significant differences in neurophysiological
activations are found between problem-solving and design tasks for both cohorts. We report the
comparison between domains elsewhere (Vieira et al., 2019b). In this paper we compare the
neurophysiological activations between the novice and experienced designers across both domains. This
is a convenience sample that can provide preliminary insights into how novices and experienced
designers approach constrained problem-solving and open design tasks across the two domains. To avoid
any blurring effect, we define novices as designers with less than 5 years of design experience and
experienced professionals as designers with more than 5 years of experience.

1.1. Electroencephalography studies of novice and experienced designers in
design research
Electroencephalographic activity reflects the summation of the synchronous activity of thousands or
millions of pyramidal neurons that have similar spatial orientation. Their ions line up and create waves
to be detected (Dickter and Kieffaber, 2014). EEG measures electromagnetic fields generated by this
neural activity. Activity from deep sources of the brain is more difficult to detect than currents near
the skull, thus EEG is more sensitive to cortical activity (Hinterberger et al., 2014, Dickter and
Kieffaber, 2014). EEG offers high temporal resolution in the order of milliseconds in a portable device
that makes it a suitable tool to investigate designing as a temporal activity.
Design studies based on EEG commenced more than 40 years ago (Martindale and Hines, 1975)
investigating cortical activation during multiple tasks. Some 20 years later a study on design
categorization tasks of experts and novices (Göker, 1997) showed that while novices try to solve
assignments through deductive reasoning, experts prefer to apply their experience directly. The
regions activated in the brain during these design problem-solving tasks vary according to the
experience a test person. From this behavioral experiment novices show a longer activity in the frontal
regions whereas the experts show longer activity in the parietal regions of the brain.
Current results from controlled experiments based on art categorization tasks and single-domain expert
designers focus on visual attention and association (Liang et al., 2017) though no comparison with
novices is provided. In the last 10 years, single domain-related EEG design studies have been used to
understand the acts of designing from a neurophysiological perspective (Liu et al., 2018; Vieira et al.,
2019a). Multiple domain experiments show preliminary comparison results (Vieira et al., 2019b).

1.2. Problem-solving and designing in constrained and open design spaces
The concepts of problem space and solution space have populated design research (Dorst and Cross,
2001; Kruger and Cross, 2006) throughout the more than half a century of formal study of design (Jones
and Thornley, 1963). One of the core research questions is whether designing, as a cognitive process, is

1570

HUMAN BEHAVIOUR AND DESIGN

distinct from problem-solving (Goel and Pirolli, 1992, 1989; Visser, 2009). In problem-solving all the
characteristics of the problem are firstly defined, therefore problem-solving is a closed task based on
known constants and known variables. Designing relates to the search for variables that are initially not
known, such variables are context sensitive, can bring change and have variant meanings according to the
design situation (Gero, 1990). In designing the characteristics of the problem are not all defined from the
start making designing an open task. Distinguishing novices and experienced designers’ neurophysiological
activations while designing and problem-solving has implications for design research and design education
in particular. The study is based on the analysis of mechanical engineers’ and industrial designers’
neurophysiological activations using an EEG headset in the context of performing problem-solving and
design tasks in a laboratory setting. The aims of the present study are to:
 investigate the neurophysiological activation differences of novice and experienced professionals
from the domains of mechanical engineering and industrial design when designing and problemsolving;
In the research reported in this paper we test the following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: the neurophysiological activations of novice professional designers when problemsolving and designing are significantly different.
Hypothesis 2: the neurophysiological activations of experienced professional designers when problemsolving and designing are significantly different.
Hypothesis 3: the neurophysiological temporal distributions of activations of problem-solving and
designing are significantly different for novice professional designers.
Hypothesis 4: the neurophysiological temporal distributions of activations of problem-solving and
designing are significantly different for experienced professional designers.

2. Methods
The study focuses on a subset of 55 experiment sessions of mechanical engineering and industrial design
professionals. The tasks and experimental procedure were piloted prior to the full study. The hypotheses
are tested by comparing the neurophysiological activations during the design tasks with those of the
problem-solving task. We compare absolute values known as transformed power (Pow), defined in 2.5,
and use the problem-solving EEG neurophysiological activation as the base for comparison.

2.1. Participants
Participants were based on a convenience sample, the subset of 55 experimental sessions comprises 26
mechanical engineers and 29 industrial designers. Final results are based on a subset of 36 right-handed
participants, 18 mechanical engineers, aged 25-40 (M = 28.9, SD = 4.2), 10 men (age M = 29.0, SD = 5.3)
and 8 women (age M = 28.7, SD = 2.5); and 18 industrial designers, aged 25-43 (M = 31.7, SD = 7.3), 10
men (age M = 35.1, SD = 7.2) and 8 women (age M = 27.5, SD = 5.1). The participants are all professionals
(experience M = 5.9, SD = 6.0). The sample has 20 participants with experience up to 5 years, and 16
participants with experience above 5 years. An independent-samples t-test was conducted to compare
participants with up to 5 years of experience with those with more than 5 years of experience from the
cohorts of mechanical engineers and industrial designers. There was no significant difference between
experienced professionals, mechanical engineers (M=9.5, SD=3.5, N=8) and experienced industrial
designers (M=12.3, SD=4.5, N=8), t=1.22 p=0.24. An independent-samples t-test was conducted to compare
participants with up to 5 years of experience from the cohorts of mechanical engineers and industrial
designers. There was no significant difference between novice professionals, mechanical engineers (M=3.0,
SD=1.4, N=10) and novice professional industrial designers (M=2.5, SD=0.7, N=10), t=0.87 p=0.39. Thus,
we compared the transformed power (Pow) of novices and experienced designers across tasks and domains.
This study was approved by the local ethics committee of the University of Porto.

2.2. Experiment design
We adopted the problem-solving and layout design tasks described in the Alexiou et al. (2009) fMRIbased study. We matched Tasks 1 and 2 with the problem-solving and design tasks (Alexiou et al., 2009)

HUMAN BEHAVIOUR AND DESIGN

1571

in terms of requests, number of constraints, stimuli and number of instructions. Task 1 is considered a
problem-solving task as the problem itself is well-defined, and the set of equivalent solutions is unique
(Alexiou et al., 2009). We extended that experiment by adding an open layout design task to produce a
block experiment in order to determine whether the open layout design task produces different results to the
semi-closed layout Task 2. Both design tasks have no predetermined final state and the tasks are openended. The block experiment consisted of a sequence of 3 tasks: problem-solving, basic layout design, and
open layout design, Figure 1. We added a fourth open design task that uses free-hand sketching after Task
3. Task 4 is an ill-defined and fully unconstrained task unrelated to formal problem-solving. Each
participant was given two sheets of paper (A3 size) and three instruments, a pencil, graphite and a pen. The
Tasks 2, 3 and 4 require defining the design space in a successive order of complexity, Table 1. The set of
four tasks was preceded by a pre-task. Detailed description can be found in Vieira et al. (2019b). As with
all block experiments, each subsequent task was potentially primed by the previous task. The Mikado pickup-sticks game was given to the participants to play in the breaks between tasks.
Table 1. Description of the problem-solving, basic design and open design tasks
Task 1
Problem-solving
In Task 1 the design
of a set of furniture is
available and three
conditions are given
as requirements. The
task consists of
placing the magnetic
pieces inside a given
area of a room with a
door, a window and a
balcony.

Task 2
Basic layout design
In Task 2 the same design
set of furniture is available
and three requests are
made. The basic design
task consists of placing the
furniture inside a given
room area according to
each participant notions of
functional and comfortable,
using at least three pieces.

Task 3
Open layout design
In Task 3 the same design
available is complemented
with a second board of
movable pieces that
comprise all the fixed
elements of the previous
tasks, namely, the walls,
the door, the window and
the balcony. The
participant is told to
arrange a space.

Task 4
Open sketching design
In the free-hand sketching
Task 4, the participants
are asked to: propose and
represent an outline design

2.3. Setup and procedure
A tangible interface for individual task performance was built based on magnetic material for easy
handling, Figure 2. Differently from the original tasks (Alexiou et al., 2009), the magnetic pieces were
placed at the top of the vertical magnetic board to prevent signal noise due to eye and head horizontal
movements. One researcher was present in each experiment session to instruct the participant and to
check for recording issues. A period of 10 minutes for setting up and a few minutes for a short
introduction are necessary for informing each participant, reading and signing of the consent agreement
and set the room temperature. The researcher checked metallic accessories for electromagnetic interference
and contact lenses. The researcher sat each participant at the desk and checked their posture. A more
detailed procedure is described in Vieira et al. (2019b). The researcher followed a script to conduct the
experiment so that each participant was presented with the same information and stimuli. Before each

1572

HUMAN BEHAVIOUR AND DESIGN

task, participants were asked to start by reading the text. The participants were asked to stay silent during
the tasks and use the breaks for talking and clarifying doubts. If needed, extra time was given to the
participants, in particular in Tasks 3 and 4, so they could find a satisfactory solution.

2.4. Data collection methods
EEG activity was recorded using a portable 14-channel system Emotiv Epoc+. Electrodes are arranged
according to the 10-10 I.S standard configuration, Figure 2. Electromagnetic interference of the room was
checked for frequencies below 60Hz. The participants performed the tasks using the physical magnetic
board, with two video cameras capturing the participant’s face and activity and an audio recorder, Figure 2.
All the data captures were streamed using Panopto software (https://www.panopto.com/), Figure 2. The
mechanical engineers and industrial designers used in this study came from a total of 100 experimental
sessions of architects, mechanical engineers, industrial designers and graphic designers, which constitute our
major data set. Of the 100 sessions 90 took place at the University of Porto. Ten sessions took place in the
Design Hub of Mouraria, Lisbon, in rooms with the necessary conditions for the experiment, such as natural
lighting sufficient for performing experiments between 9:00 and 15:00 and no electromagnetic interference.

audio, video and screen

2.5. Data processing methods
Due to left-handedness or EEG or video recording issues seven experiments were excluded, leaving 48
sessions. The fourteen electrodes collected data with a 256 Hz sampling rate, low cutoff 0.1 Hz, high
cutoff 50 Hz. We adopted the blind source separation (BSS) technique based on canonical correlation
analysis (CCA) for the removal of muscle artifacts from EEG recordings (De Clercq et al., 2006)
adapted to remove the short EMG bursts due to articulation of spoken language (Vos et al., 2010). A
detailed description is provided in Vieira et al. (2019a). Data analysis included total power values on
individual and aggregate levels using MatLab and EEGLab open-source software. All the EEG segments
of the recorded data were used for averaging throughout the entire tasks, from beginning to end. All the
tasks of this experiment involve thinking and motion. The motor actions involved in the tasks using the
tangible interface versus the free-hand sketching and their corresponding EEG signals are of the same
source, thus we claim that the BSSCCA procedure filters 90% of the signal from artifacts. We report
results on transformed power (Pow), the mean of the squared values of microvolts per second (µV2) for
each electrode processed signal per task. This measure tells us about the amplitude of the signal per
channel and per participant magnified to squared values. We present Pow values of aggregates of
participants’ individual results, for each cohort, per total task and for each task deciles for the temporal
analysis. After determining the outliers as described below, we calculated the mean and standard
deviation of each measure for each cohort. A z-transform was conducted in the analysis of Pow across
tasks for each of the participants’ data to determine outliers; the criteria for excluding participants were
based on the evidence of 6 or more threshold z-score values above 1.96 or below -1.96 and individual
measurements above 2.81 or below -2.81. This resulted in a further 8 sessions being excluded leaving
40. After the division of the Pow into time deciles amplitude leading to two and a half standard
deviations from the mean as threshold values were excluded per channel, 4 experiments were further
excluded leaving 36, coincidentally 18 per domain.

2.6. Data analysis methods
We carried out statistical analyses of total and temporal neurophysiological activations based on
dividing the design sessions into time deciles. We performed standard analyses based on the design of
the experiment: a repeated-measures ANOVA with pairwise comparisons to follow up on specific
differences with task, hemisphere, electrode and decile as within-subject factors for each cohort. These
analyses were performed for the dependent variable of Pow and for all the within-subject variables.
The threshold for significance in all the analyses is p≤.05.

3. Analysis of results
From the analysis of the transformed power (Pow) results across the 36 participants indicate that the
tasks can be distinguished from each other for the novices and the experienced designers.

3.1. Problem-solving and design tasks of novice and experienced professionals
To compare the Pow of all the tasks we first performed an analysis by running a 5x2x7 repeatedmeasurement ANOVA, with the within-subject factors of task, hemisphere and electrode. From the
analysis of the 20 novice participants, we found significant main effects, Table 2.
Table 2. Significant effects from the ANOVA based on the 20 novice designers
Significant main effects
task (p <.01); hemisphere (p <.001); electrode (p =.02)

In addition, we conducted pairwise comparisons for hemisphere, electrode and task. The pairwise
comparisons revealed that the open design sketching Task 4 differs significantly from:
 Problem-solving Task 1(p =.01)
 Layout design Task 2 (p =.01) and open layout design Task 3 (p =.02)
The pairwise comparisons further revealed differences between hemispheres for the 7 electrodes and
tasks. In Figure 3, left image, we report on significant (p≤.05) pairwise comparisons found between
Task 1 (problem-solving) and Task 4 (open free-hand sketching design).

The radar plot simulates the two hemispheres by distributing the electrodes (10-10 IS) symmetrically
around a vertical axis. Total Pow scores per electrode can be considered by comparing with the vertical
scale and across the different tasks. Circles represent the channels with activation of statistically significant
differences in Task 4 from Task 1, namely, FC6 (p<.01); P8 (p=.02); O2 (p<.01) in the right hemisphere,
and P7 (p=.04) and O1 (p=.01) in the left hemisphere. Task 4 shows higher activations across channels.
From the analysis of the 16 experienced designers we found significant main effects as depicted in Table 3.

Table 3. Significant effects from the ANOVA based on the 16 experienced designers

The pairwise comparisons revealed that the open design sketching Task 4 and open layout design Task
3 respectively differ significantly from:
 Problem-solving Task 1(p=.02)
 Layout design Task 2 (p<.01)
The pairwise comparisons further revealed differences between hemisphere for the 7 electrodes and
tasks. In Figure 3, image on the right, we report on significant (p≤.05) pairwise comparisons found
between Task 1 (problem-solving) and Task 4 (open free-hand sketching design) of experienced
designers. Circles represent the channels with activation of statistically significant differences in Task
4 from Task 1, namely, FC6 (p<.01) in the right hemisphere, and O1 (p<.01) in the left hemisphere.
EEG neurophysiological activations are associated with conceptual expansion (Abrahams, 2019).
Novice designers show higher activation in channels (F7, AF3), associated with deductive reasoning
and channels of the right occipitotemporal cortex. Experienced designers show even higher activation
in channels associated with inductive reasoning (F3, P7), channels of the right dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (AF4, F8, FC6,) and right and left occipitotemporal cortices (T8, P8, O2, O1, P7 and T7).

3.2. Analysis of temporal stages of novice and experienced professionals
Designing is a temporal activity, segmenting across time shows how designing unfolds in stages.
Different cognitive behaviours can be found when design sessions are divided into deciles (Kan and
Gero, 2017; Jiang et al., 2014). Results from running a 5x2x7x10 repeated-measurement ANOVA with
the within-subject factors of task, hemisphere, electrode and decile, for each cohort are presented below.
From the analysis of the 20 novice professional designers, we found significant main effects, Table 4.
General higher activations of channels of the right occipitotemporal cortex and left secondary visual
cortex are shown in the open space sketching design Task 4 across deciles, Figure 4.

Figure 5. Channels of significant differences for experienced designers from Task 1 to Task 4,
shown as solid circles

Statistically significant differences between problem-solving Task 1 and Task 4 occur in the temporal
and secondary visual cortices. The channels with decreased activation from Task 1 to Task 4 are
located in the prefrontal cortex as well.

The pairwise comparisons revealed that the open design sketching Task 4 and open layout design Task
3 respectively differ significantly from:
 Problem-solving Task 1 (p<.05) and basic layout design Task 2 (p=.04)
 Basic layout design Task 2 (p=.03)

HUMAN BEHAVIOUR AND DESIGN

4. Conclusion
Results from this analysis of the EEG data of the 36 participants show significant differences of
neurophysiological activations between problem-solving Task 1 and the open design sketching Task 4
for both novice and experienced professionals across the two cohorts of mechanical engineers and
industrial designers. Thus, preliminary evidence provides initial support for hypotheses 1 and 2: the
neurophysiological activations of experienced and novice professional designers when problemsolving and designing are significantly different. Experienced professionals show higher transformed
power (Pow) across all channels than do novice designers.
The temporal distributions of neurophysiological activations of novice and experienced professionals
also show significant differences between problem-solving Task 1 and the open design sketching Task
4 providing initial support for hypothesis 3 and 4: the neurophysiological temporal distributions of
activations of problem-solving and designing are significantly different for experienced and novice
professional designers. Novice designers show higher variation of Pow between Tasks 1 and 4.
Further analysis will focus in the following areas: (i) differences between novice and experienced
professionals, (ii) connecting brain region activations to cognitive functions associated with those
regions, (iii) band filtering, and (iv) a more fine grained analysis addressing temporal changes.
These results show the effects of experience in the neurophysiological activations when tackling
different problem statements. Studying the brains of designers is relatively new and provides a more
objective measurement of designing through neurocognition than cognitive studies alone. Such studies
have the potential to be able to answer research questions that are currently difficult to answer.
Questions such as: how persistent are effects of educational interventions? Further advancements can
enable novice designers to better monitor their thinking modes during the design process and therefore
improve design performance and provide knowledge on how change can be predicted in design. Novel
experimental techniques are under development to allow for a direct correlation between design
cognition, obtained through protocol analysis, with these objective neurophysiological measurements.
