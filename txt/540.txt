Abstract—In recent years, steady-state visual evoked potential
(SSVEP) based brain-computer interface (BCI) has received
much attentions. However, most SSVEP based BCI devices are
not portable and have high price, which are not suitable to be
used for clinical and commercial purpose. Thanks to the low cost
and portable Emotiv EPOC, it brings BCI into daily life. In this
paper, SSVEP based BCI through Emotiv EPOC is implemented.
BCI 2000 is employed to connect Emotiv EPOC and Matlab to
implement the online system. The online experiments have the
accuracy of 95.83±3.59 %, information transfer rate (ITR) with
22.85±1.85 bits/min and detection duration of 5.25±2.14 sec.

INTRODUCTION

Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems establish direct
communication connections between human brain and external
devices, which skip peripheral nerves and muscular tissues [1],
[2]. For example, invasive BCI have been used to treat noncongenital (acquired) blindness in vision science [3]. For
patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or brain
stem stroke, BCI provide an alternative way to connect with
external environments. Therefore, BCI lead to an improved
quality of life and reduced social costs.
In recent years, non-invasive BCI such as
Electroencephalography (EEG) have been widely developed.
Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) attracts more and
more attentions because of its high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
and higher information transfer rate (ITR) [4]-[6]. SSVEP
presents natural responses to visual stimulation at specific
frequencies in a range larger than 6Hz, that is, when the retina
is excited by a visual stimulus, the brain can produce relevant
electrical signals with the same frequency as the stimulus
signal as well as its harmonics [7]. The SSVEP can be recorded
from the surface of the scalp over the visual cortex.
In our previous work [8], [9], SSVEP based BCI has been
implemented by using g.USBamp (from Guger Technologies,
Graz, Austria) and the system has very good performances.

However, there are also some drawbacks in the previous
system based on g.tec platform. Firstly, using the previous
system needs longer preparation time. Subjects have to clean
their hair before the experiments in order to remove oil or dirt
on scalp. In addition, the subjects have to wear an electrode
cap filled with conductive gel to ensure the conductivity,
which may increase the workload and make the subjects feel
uncomfortable. Secondly, the high financial cost of g.tec
(about USD $23,215) in the market greatly restricts to use it as
commercial purpose. The longer preparation time and high
price determine that g.tec is suitable for research purpose but
not common people and disabled people.
Compared with g.tec, Emotiv EPOC is an epoch-making
wireless BCI device with a low price (USD $299 for an EPOC
neuro-headset and USD $500 for the Developer edition) and it
has shorter preparation time to use. Before the experiments,
subjects only need to drop some special solution (contact
lenses protection solution) on the sponge in electrodes on the
headset and directly wear it. With Emotiv EPOC it does not
need to clean the scalp and other after-care work, so it is much
more eco-friendly. Another advantage is that, the operation of
Emotiv EPOC is very easy to be understood, so that even
customers without much BCI knowledge could learn to use its
basic functions easily. The Emotiv EPOC has already been
used by other research groups, for instance, they use it to play
video games [10]. Since the purpose is to bring BCI technique
into our daily life and improve life quality, especially for
disables, therefore, Emotiv EPOC is a promising device for
BCI.
However, the Emotiv EPOC does not have much open
source and has some limitations on Matlab programming.
Hence, it is difficult to implement it on SSVEP BCI system.
Therefore, the objective of this study was to solve the above
problem. Firstly, to achieve offline signal processing, the
Emotiv TestBench (software provided by Emotiv) is used to
record and convert the EEG data to the format that Matlab can
acquire. Then canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is
employed for feature detection on EEG data and the
performance of g.tec and Emotiv EPOC is compared.
Secondly, due to the difficulty in direct connection, BCI2000

is employed to connect Emotiv EPOC and Matlab to
implement the online system.

Hz. These visual stimulators are programmed in Microsoft
Visual C++ 6.0 and DirectX DirectDraw 7.

METHODS

A. Visual Stimulator
The visual stimulator can be presented by using lightemitting diode (LED) or liquid crystal display (LCD)/ cathode
ray tube (CRT) monitors [11]. The LEDs need extra elaborate
hardware to generate a constant frequency and it is also not
easy to configure. Therefore, we prefer to use LCD/CRT
monitors.
Based on traditional frame method, stimuli frequencies on a
LCD/CRT monitor could be limited by the monitor refresh rate
to some extent. That is to say, the refresh rate should be
multiple times of the stimulus frequencies. For example, for a
monitor with 60 Hz refresh rate in practical design of visual
stimulator, 6.67 Hz, 7.5 Hz, 8.57 Hz, 10 Hz, 12 Hz, 15 Hz and
20 Hz are usually used. However, the number of stimulus
frequencies and the system performance are largely limited.
What is worse, in SSVEP response, the amplitude of harmonic
frequency could be larger or even stronger than that of the
theoretical response frequency. This may lead to a result that
the system cannot distinguish between the fundamental
frequency and the harmonic frequency (e.g. 7.5 Hz and 15 Hz).
On the other hand, the limited stimulus frequencies could affect
later online work. In a 60 Hz refresh rate monitor, there are 60
frames per second and the frame number per cycle is a
constant. For 10 Hz flicker, it reverses between black and white
every three frames; for 12 Hz flicker, it states in black for three
frames and reverses to white for two frames. Therefore, the
sequences of a certain two frequencies could be combined to
get three frequencies with a varying number of frames in each
cycle (e.g. 10 Hz and 12 Hz produce 10.5 Hz, 11 Hz and 11.5
Hz). In our experiment, it could be verified that 11 Hz could
also make stable SSVEP response (see Fig.1).

B. Algorithms
In this paper, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is used
to extract frequency information from the multiple channel
EEG signals. CCA is a multivariable statistical method used
when there are two sets of data, which may have some
underlying correlation. It finds a pair of linear combinations,
for two sets, such that the correlation between the two
canonical variables is maximized. CCA extends ordinary
correlation to two sets of variables and is widely used in
statistical and information mining. Consider two
multidimensional random variables X, Y and their linear
combinations x = X T Wx and y = Y T Wy , respectively. CCA
finds the weight vectors, Wx and Wy , which maximize the
correlation between x and y, by solving the following problem:

For offline experiments, 16 frequencies stimulator is used
and the distribution is shown in Fig. 2 (a). Its frequencies are
from 8 to 15.5 Hz with 0.5 Hz interval between each two. The
stimulus interface for online experiment is shown in Fig. 2 (b),
which contains 6 stimulus frequencies. The stimulus
frequencies are 6.67 Hz, 7.5 Hz, 8.57 Hz, 10 Hz, 12 Hz and 15

i = 1,2,..., k

where ρi is the CCA coefficient, and command C is used to
make a determination, more details please refer to [12].

Information transfer rate (ITR) is a very important index to
evaluate a BCI system. ITR is represented by the information
transmitted given in bits per minute. The formula is defined as:

ITR =

60
S

× [log 2 N + p log 2 p + (1 − p ) log 2 (

(1 − p )
N −1

)] (3)

S is calculated as the detection speed which is valued as 6 in
our experiment; p represents the probability to input characters
correctly, or in other words p is the CCA accuracy; N is the
number of the possible characters which equals to 16 in offline
experiments and 6 in online experiments. N is the detective
speed (gaze length 6s in offline experiment and variable in
online experiment) and p means the accuracy.
C. Signal Processing
The CCA is used for extraction of frequency information of
SSVEP signals. In our experiments, CCA method is
implemented for 3s length data, and then the coefficient is
calculated every 0.25s. For example, 24 correlation coefficients
will be obtained in a 6s length gazing interval in offline
experiments. The corresponding command will be selected
only when more than 2 commands C of them are the same,
otherwise the EEGs should be detected again. Then the
corresponding correlation coefficients ρi are picked up to
calculate the mean. If it is larger than the threshold value which
is equal to 0.3, the selected command C will be chosen as the
final result and the system will output a selection command.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Experimental Setup
In our experiment, a LCD monitor was used as visual
stimulator (ViewSonic 22”, refresh rate 60 Hz, 1680×1080
pixel resolution). There were four subjects with experience in
BCI experiments. The subjects sat in a comfortable chair facing
the screen and kept the distance about 60cm. Due to the special
characteristics of Emotiv EPOC, we did our best to build the
system setting in the same conditions. Since Emotiv EPOC
only had static electrode locations: AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1,
O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8 and AF4, 4 standard EEG electrodes
placed on P8, P7, O1, and O2 were used as input channels in
both devices (g.USBamp and Emotiv EPOC). Oz was the
ground electrode and the sampling rate in g.USBamp was set
as 128 bits/s since Emotiv EPOC could only offer 128 bit/s
sampling rate. In g.USBamp, EEG signals were collected and
data was saved through Matlab Simulink. While Emotiv EPOC
data was saved in Emotiv Test Bench and then converted to
mat files. The dominant frequency was detected every 0.25s
and the threshold value in CCA was 0.3. During our offline
experiment, the gaze length was 6s and the rest length was 4s
so that the subjects could change their sights to the next target
and will not feel uncomfortable for their eyes. Each subject
needs to do 3 trials for each amplifier, a total of 8 groups, 24
trials. In our online experiments, the detection duration is
variable and there is no rest time. Each subject needs to do 3
trials in Emotiv, totally 12 trails.

B. Offline Experimental Results
TABLE I presents the average accuracy and the average
ITR of the 4 subjects using g.USBamp. Subject S1 and S2
presented prefect performance in the experiments with 100 %
accuracy and 40 bits/min ITR. Subject S3 presented
93.75±1.74 % accuracy which was also good. However,
85.41±2.13 % accuracy for subject S4 demonstrated there was
individual difference in SSVEP experiments. The mean
accuracy of all the four subjects was 94.79±1.94 %.
TABLE II demonstrates the results from Emotiv EPOC
group. Subject S1 had the best performance 94.55±3.34 %,
which was acceptable but still with a little difference from his
control group result. For Subject S2 and S3, their average
accuracies were reduced to 85.14±7.21% and 83.13±5.11%
respectively, with over 10 % off compared with their control
group results. Subject S4 had accuracy around 70 %, also with
nearly 25 % difference from his control group result. Finally,
the average accuracy for Emotiv EPOC group presented 11.8
% decrease from that of control group.
Based on 4 of 6 trials of S4, he had worse performance
especially when gazing 8-13 Hz range stimulus signals. The
corresponding frequency band was overlapped with alpha
band. Fig.3 demonstrates one FFT plot of his EEG signal when
gazing at 13 Hz stimulus. It is obvious that, the highest
amplitude was not located on 13 Hz, but in alpha wave band,
which leaded to false detection by the system. The result
verifies that some subjects with stronger alpha wave may lead
to worse performance in SSVEP experiments.

C. Online Experimental Results
We use software BCI2000 to connect Emotiv and Matlab.
BCI2000 is a multi-functional system for BCI research, which
contains main functions of data acquisition, stimulus
presentation, and brain monitoring applications. After
launching the BCI2000 while it has already linked with Matlab,
then the Matlab command window can be seen. The brain
signal is sent to MATLAB workspace as a matrix. Therefore,
we could directly apply m-file to analyze the online result.
BCI2000 will send a block with 128 samples per second to
Matlab. In Matlab, we divide the block into 4 frames, leading
to per detection each 0.25 sec (no rest time). In theory, the
shortest detection duration per target is 4 sec. For each result, 4
detections are needed. TABLE III shows the result of our
experiment. The average accuracy was 95.83±3.59 %, which
was high in online SSVEP experiment. And the average
detection duration per target was 5.25±2.14 sec, which was still
acceptable.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, SSVEP based BCI based on a market-aimed
platform Emotiv EPOC is implemented. Compared with g.tec,
Emotiv EPOC is an epoch-making wireless BCI device with a
low price and it has shorter preparation time for use. However,
the Emotiv EPOC does not have much open source and has
some limitations on Matlab programming. To overcome these
difficulties, firstly, for offline signal processing, the Emotiv
TestBench (software provided by Emotiv) is used to record
and convert the EEG data to the format that Matlab can
acquire. Then canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is
employed for feature detection on EEG data and the
performance of g.tec and Emotiv EPOC is compared. The
accuracy and ITR of g.tec are 94.79±1.94 % and 35.66±5.71
bits/min. For the Emotiv, the average accuracy is 82.99±4.98
% and the ITR is 28.06±6.45 bits/min. Secondly, due to the
difficulty in direct connection, BCI2000 is employed to
connect Emotiv EPOC and Matlab to implement the online
system. The online system achieves an average accuracy of
95.83±3.59 %, an average ITR of 18.99±1.68 bits/min and
detection time is 5.25±2.14 sec. Finally, the online system is

used and tested for environment control which will help the
users especially people with disabilities to control home
appliances without any body movements and thus enhance
their life quality.
The future work may include further improvements on the
online implementation of Emotiv SSVEP and some other
types of BCI based on Emotiv EPOC such as motor imagery
(MI). Furthermore, in this work, it is found that using existing
software for connection to Matlab with Emotiv is troublesome
and inconvenient to some extent. A better solution to build a
stable or flexible connection between Emotiv EPOC and
Matlab would be desirable and deserve more investigations.
