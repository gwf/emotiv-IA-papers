Abstract—Brain Computer Interface (BCI) requires accurate
and reliable discrimination of EEG’s features. One of the most
common method used in feature extraction for BCI is a common
spatial pattern (CSP). CSP is a technique to distinguish two
opposite features by computing the spatial pattern of the
measured EEG channels. The existing CSP is known to be prone
to the over-fitting problem. Covariance estimation is an
important process in obtaining spatial pattern using CSP. The
empirical covariance estimation ignores the spurious information
between channels of EEG device. This may cause inaccurate
covariance estimation, which results to lower accuracy
performance. In this study, a masking covariance matrix is
introduced based on the functionality of brain region. The
addition of masking covariance is to improve the performance of
CSP. Features obtained through features extraction is then used
as the input to Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Comparisons
between features of conventional CSP and with the addition of
masking covariance are visually observed using the collected
EEG signals using EMOTIV. The performance accuracy of the
proposed technique has offered slight improvement from 0.5 to
0.5567. The obtained results are then discussed and analyzed in
this study. Therefore, by introducing masking covariance matrix,
the performance of the existing CSP algorithm can be improved.

I. INTRODUCTION
Brain computer interfaces (BCI) is now being aggressively
studied with the aim to translate brain activities into a readable
command where this command is later used for triggering
actuator in real life. Our brain activity can be monitored by
using Electroencephalogram (EEG) device where this device
consisting of electrodes to acquire EEG signal on their
respective region. Traditionally, the process of monitoring
brain activity required subject to undergo surgical implantation
to place the electrode on the surface or within the depth of the
brain. Modernization has now allowed the signal to be acquired
by only attaching electrodes on the scalp without doing any
surgery.
However, the capabilities of fetching EEG signal without
surgical implantation brings drawback in the quality of the
signal. The distance from the neuron will diminish the EEG
signal property that we would like to observe while mixing the
signal from another region (noise) [1]. Therefore, the signal
cannot be used directly in BCI application. Overcoming this

problem lead to the study of numerous feature extractions such
as Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) [2]. Laplacian filter [3] and
common average reference [4] to obtain only usable feature to
distinguish the EEG signal into its category. This paper will be
focusing on the implementation of CSP method to extract the
relevant feature from EEG Signal.
CSP method is an algorithm commonly used to extract the
most significant discriminative information from EEG signals.
It was first suggested for binary classification of EEG trials [5].
CSP algorithm performs covariance estimation process where
it computes the projection of most differing power or variance
ratios in feature space by using the spatial filter and the
projections are calculated by simultaneous diagonal of
covariance matrices of two classes [2]. The importance of this
process is to obtain the correlation of each channel with others.
Most of the time, the significant features are obtained from the
first few most discriminative filters. These features will be used
to differentiate between two opposite features we want to
observe.
Even though CSP is capable of extracting the features by
applying a discriminative filter. The objective of the process is
not to directly input the relevant features obtain through CSP
process into classifier but to amplify the EEG signal with most
significant features while minimizing the EEG signal with
weak features so information received by classifier will be
clearer. Often a classifier will receive input by computing the
variance of these features together with collected EEG earlier
[2]. CSP is also known to be highly sensitive to noise and
prone to over-fitting. To address this issue, regularized CSP is
proposed as in [6, 7].
In order to increase the accuracy of CSP analysis, the
algorithm is further refined by introducing few addition on the
original algorithm. In paper [5], Haiping Lu took a different
approach by regularizing the covariance matrix estimation in
common spatial pattern extraction. The proposed algorithm is
consisting of two regularization parameters where the first
parameter controls the shrinkage of a subject specific
covariance matrix towards a “generic” covariance matrix to
improve the estimation stability based on the principle of
generic learning [8]. The second regularization parameter
controls the shrinkage of the sample based covariance matrix
estimation towards a scaled identity matrix to account for the
biased due to limited number of samples [5]. Besides
regularizing covariance matrix approach, in paper [9],

Allesandro Balzi has implement the Importance Weighted
Estimator to the covariance estimation (used as input by every
CSP variant) rather than modify the CSP itself that make the
covariance estimation more robust to non-stationary signal, as
a result the method brings to improvement in classification
accuracy.
Moving differently, to overcome the over-fitting information
on CSP algorithm, we believed that by introducing the masking
weight covariance, CSP performance can be improved. The
idea is based on the functionality of brain’s love region.
Therefore, the masking covariance role is to reduce the
relationship of the channel that is not mapped within the same
functionality region. To design the masking covariance, the
knowledge regards on how the EEG signal is arranged is
required because it involves predefining matrix based on the
channel allocation on the signal data. The wanted region will
be defined by allocating maximum covariance while others are
lower.
The feature map of the data can be self-organized referring to
the matrix setup. In this case, it will be easier for the classifier
to respond on the topographic map corresponds to a particular
feature of the input pattern.

which equalized the variances in the space spanned by 𝑈𝑐 .
Now all eigenvalues of 𝑃𝐶1̅ 𝑃′ are equal to 1.
𝑆1 = 𝑃𝐶1̅ 𝑃 ′

𝑆2 = 𝑃𝐶2̅ 𝑃 ′

Now 𝑆1 and 𝑆2 share common eigenvectors where:
𝑆1 = 𝑈∑1 𝑈 𝑇

𝑆2 = 𝑈∑2 𝑈 𝑇
∑1 + ∑2 = 𝐼

𝐶=

𝐸𝐸 Τ

𝑊 = 𝑈𝑇 𝑃

where 𝐸 is the EEG signal and Τ denotes the transpose
operator. 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒 is the sum of a diagonal element of its content.
The spatial pattern of each class (left and right motor imagery)
will be distributed individually by calculating the average trials
of each group.
The spatial pattern is then masked by the previously declared
masking weight covariance. The masked spatial pattern for
each class can be computed as follow:
𝐶𝑀1 = 𝑊 × 𝐶1

(2)

𝑊 is the masking weight declared earlier and 𝐶1 is the
covariance of signal class 1 (thinking left). This shall be
applied on both class and obtain the composite spatial
covariance from (3).
̅ + 𝐶𝑀2
̅ = 𝑈0 ∑𝑈0𝑇
𝐶𝑇 = 𝐶𝑀1

where 𝑈0 is the matrix of eigenvectors and ∑ is the sum of
diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. The whitening transformation

With projection matrix 𝑊. The original EEG can be
transformed into uncorrelated components:

𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒(𝐸𝐸 Τ )

(6)

The eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues for 𝑆1 have the
smallest eigenvalues for 𝑆2 and vice versa. The transformation
of whitened EEG onto the eigenvectors corresponding to the
largest eigenvalues in ∑1 and ∑2 is optimal for separating
variance in two signal matrices. Thee projection matrix 𝑊 is
denoted as:

II. EMPLOYED TECHNIQUE
A. Common Spatial Pattern
The EEG signal obtained through EMOTIV device form
14 × 𝑇 data where 14 is the number of channels for EMOTIV
and 𝑇 represents samples per channel. The covariance of the
signal can be calculated from:

(5)

(9)

𝑍 can be seen as EEG source components including common
and specific components of different tasks. The original EEG X
can be reconstructed by:
𝑋 = 𝑊 −1 𝑍

(10)

where 𝑊 −1 is the inverse matrix of 𝑊. The columns of 𝑊 −1
are spatial patterns, which can be considered as EEG source
distribution vectors. The first and last columns of 𝑊 −1 are the
most important spatial patterns that explain the largest variance
of one task and the smallest variance of the other.
B. Feature Extraction
The features used for classification are obtained by
decomposing the EEG as (6). For each direction of imagery
movement, the variances of only small number 𝑚 of signals
most suitable for discrimination are used for the construction of
the classifier. The signal 𝑍𝑝 that maximizes the difference of
variance of left versus right motor imagery EEG are the ones
that are associated with the largest eigenvalues ∑1 and ∑2 .
These signals are the 𝑚 first and last rows of 𝑍 due to the
calculation of 𝑊.
𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑍𝑝 )
𝑓𝑝 = log ( 2𝑚
)
∑𝑖=1 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑍𝑝 )

(11)

The feature vectors 𝑓𝑝 of left and right trials are used to
calculate a linear classifier [5] [10]. The log-transformation
serves to approximate normal distribution of the data.
For proper estimation of the classification accuracy, the data
set of each subject is divided into a training and testing set. The
training set is used to calculate a classifier, which is used to
classify the testing set. This training procedure is repeated

using a random weight generated by ELM and also taking a
different portion of training and testing set.
C. Classifier
The evaluation of both training and testing accuracy is done
using ELM model. By providing the pattern produced by
feature extraction at (10), ELM will create a hyper plane
between two features and distinguish which side represents
which information. The model of ELM can be depicted as
Figure 1.

Figure 2: Experiment setup

B. EEG Signal Information
The sampling rate of EMOTIV device had been set to
128Hz. A session length lasts for 53 seconds where early
preparation last for 5 seconds, each cue took 3 seconds and rest
between cues took 2 seconds. The collective acquisition
consisting of 160 trials for training samples and 120 trials for
testing samples where each subject undergo 10 trials each (5
left hand and 5 right hand). This process had gone through a
little modification from [8] where visual cue is reduced from
3.5 seconds to 3 seconds.

Figure 1: ELM Model

From the model in Figure 1, the computation output is
obtained by using following equation. The operation of ELM
can be summarized as follows [11]:
1) Obtain features set 𝑥𝑡 , activation function 𝑔(𝑥) and
number of hidden node 𝑁
2) Randomly assign input weight 𝑤𝑖 and bias 𝑏𝑖
3) Calculate the hidden layer output matrix
4) Calculate the output weight 𝛽
The computation can be derived by (12):

𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑠𝑖𝑔(∑ 𝛽𝑖𝐺(𝑎𝑖, 𝑏𝑖, 𝑥))

III. METHODOLOGY
This section will discuss about the conventional CSP
method in computing covariance matrix estimation and later
the implementation of the masked weight into the CSP. The
performance of both methods is then compared using ELM by
evaluating the accuracy of both methods. Most of ELM part is
referred in [11, 13].
A. EEG Signal Acquisition
Firstly, EEG signals are acquired by using EMOTIV Epoch
(14 channels). Subjects were briefed about how the experiment
was going to be conducted. A short video was played during
the acquisition period to stimulate subjects on thinking of
moving either right hand or left hand. Subjects were sitting on
the conducive chair while the other part of their body remains
static. In this experiment, the process of thinking left hand and
right hand is set to be alternating so that subjects will active
switching their thoughts after short rest between these two sets.
The experiment setup is depicted as Figure 2.

Figure 3: Data acquisition process

C. Masking Weight Covariance
The aim of this experiment is to improve the design of
spatial filters which lead to new time series whose variances
are optimal for discrimination of two class of EEG related with
left and right motor imagery. Most of the parts, the analysis is
using CSP procedure however a little modification on
calculating normalized covariance takes place. This method is
called masking weight, is introduced by defining a correlation
between each electrode and maximize the selected electrodes
we believed giving us the most necessary information
regarding the conducted experiment. In this case, the defined
masking weight is as in Figure 4.
The empty space in the matrix represents less important
electrodes where the value assigned in this experiment is
distributed equally. In this experiment, we believed that the
most significant information can be retrieved from channels
AF3, AF4, F7, F8, F3, F4, FC5 and FC6. These regions are
called as the functional region where it’s provides the
information omitted by motor cortex. The selected region is
depicted as Figure 5.

B. Feature Observation
For calculation of the spatial filters, each trial is split into
different time segment of 3 seconds length where is contains
384 time sample for each trial. The features produce through
the stated process are evaluated by eyes before sending it
through ELM. Two graphs are plotted where the top represents
the features obtain through conventional CSP approach while
the graph at the bottom represents the approach.
Each of masked weight value is tested for 5 times and the
average of them is compared with default CSP approach. At
first, a few analysis on a number of hidden nodes is done by
tested, which hidden nodes is best to be used in ELM model.
Then activation function can be any nonlinear piecewise
continuous functions, where in this case, sigmoid is used [18].
Tables 1 and 2 represent the average training and testing
accuracy over 5 times and show the comparison between
performance of CSP and CSP with addition masking
covariance (CSP-MC). These calculations were done few trials
with variable weight in ELM model. The results from the trials
are used to obtain the mean, standard deviation, maximum and
minimum of the overall data. In this case, the bold value
represents the best performance as compared to the other
method. Among all the masking weight covariance set up,
testing accuracy of Masking Weight Covariance (MWC) 0.5
produces the highest average accuracy as compared to others
value and also conventional CSP. The maximum and minimum
value of MWC 0.5 is slightly higher than conventional CSP as
well. From these results, 0.5 is the best value in weight
distribution on less relevant region.

D. EEG Signal Preprocessing
Signal preprocessing was done to remove unnecessary
information within the signal such as preparation and rest
duration. In addition, the signal will be filtered using bandpass
filter to remove unnecessary frequency band, which may carry
artifact in the signal [14]. In this experiment, a Butterworth
bandpass filter is used to accept only frequency ranging from
8Hz to 30Hz [15]. This frequency band was chosen because it
encompasses the alpha and beta frequency bands, which have
been shown to be most important for movement classification
[5, 14].
IV. EXPERIMENT, RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Parameter Setting
Few parameters need to be stressed on during
implementation of ELM. In this case, ELM is set to use
classifier mode instead of regression because the dataset is
going to be split based on its homogeneity, a dependent
variables of the features. The number of hidden nodes were
tested with iterative number and found 15 nodes are sufficient
to optimize the algorithm performance [17]. Sigmoid is used
for the activation function based on [17]

Figure 6: Pattern improvement by masked weight
[3]

Figure 6 shows that the pattern produced after computation
(10) for single trial has significantly changed. This is because
others channels, which provide signal believed to be event
related desynchronize (ERD) is reduced by masking the weight
on covariance of the CSP approach. On visual inspection, the
first three channels provide higher information about imagery
movement of the left hand while the last 3 channels provide
higher information imagery movement of right hand.
V. CONCLUSION

[4]

[5]

[6]

[7]

Conventional CSP algorithm computes the covariance by
calculating the relationship between each channel directly.
However, by introducing masked weight, monitoring the exact
channels, which providing the needed information. Masking
weight allows 2 channels correlate to each other by either on
full scale information for relevant channels and minimize scale
information on non-relevant channels.
The resulting pattern of the features obtained through CSP
algorithm is inspected manually for most trials to see if there is
a significant difference between conventional approach and
addition of masking weight. It appears that the pattern
produced by addition masking weight has slightly changed the
pattern for most trials.
Current experiment concludes that by choosing 0.5 as the
masking weight for covariance will produce the best testing
accuracy for most of the times. In this paper, the approach of
introducing masked weight is distributed evenly on all less
important channels. We believe by having a more proper
distribution, further improvement in the result accuracy can be
obtained.
