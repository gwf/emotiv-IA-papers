EPOC outside the shield

Abstract
Low-cost, portable electroencephalographic (EEG) headsets have become
commercially available in the last 10 years. One such system, Emotiv’s EPOC, has been
modified to allow event-related potential (ERP) research. Because of these innovations,
EEG research may become more widely available in non-traditional settings. Although
the EPOC has previously been shown to provide data comparable to research-grade
equipment and has been used in real-world settings, how EPOC performs without the
electrical shielding used in research-grade laboratories is yet to be systematically tested.
In the current article we address this gap in the literature by asking participants to perform
a simple EEG experiment in shielded and unshielded contexts. The experiment was the
observation of human versus wristwatch faces which were either inverted or noninverted.
This method elicited the face-sensitive N170 ERP.
In both shielded and unshielded contexts, the N170 amplitude was larger when
participants viewed human faces and peaked later when a human face was inverted. More
importantly, Bayesian analysis showed no difference in the N170 measured in the
shielded and unshielded contexts. Further, the signal recorded in both contexts was highly
correlated. The EPOC appears to reliably record EEG signals without a purpose-built
electrically-shielded room or laboratory-grade preamplifier.

EPOC outside the shield

1. Introduction
Electroencephalography (EEG) has traditionally been the province of those who
can afford expensive equipment and specialised laboratory spaces. A potential solution to
this access problem has been provided by the development of portable and comparatively
inexpensive EEG headsets for use in the home (e.g., Emotiv EPOC®, Imec’s wireless
EEG headset, NeuroFocus MyndTM, Neurokeeper’s headset, NeuroSky Mindwave®).
Though not designed for research, modifications to consumer systems such as the EPOC
have been used to timelock EEG data with conditions of interest, allowing analysis of the
electrophysiological response to specific events (i.e., event-related potentials, ERPs). In
fact, the quality of these recordings has been shown to be equivalent to research-grade
EEG systems in a laboratory setting (Badcock et al., 2013; 2015, de Lissa et al., 2015).
However, the advantage of these portable systems is the chance to take them outside of
laboratory settings. Therefore, especially given the lack of a noise-reducing pre-amplifier
used with expensive research-grade EEG systems, it is important to establish the
reliability of ERPs recorded inside and outside an electrically shielded room using
consumer-grade EEG systems. Here, we specifically considered Emotiv’s EPOC.
Though a comparison of signals recorded between shielded and unshielded
environments has yet to be performed, this has not stopped researchers from using the
device in non-traditional settings. For example, Debener, Minow, Emkes, Gandras, and
de Vos (2012) showed that the EPOC could be used to track ERPs while in a quiet office
or walking outdoors (see also De Vos, Gandras, & Debener, 2014). Further, due to its
quick setup, the EPOC may be a useful tool in gaining electrophysiological insights from
individuals or populations who find the traditionally longer setup time challenging (e.g.,
individuals with autism; Yau, McArthur, Badcock, & Brock, 2015).

EPOC outside the shield

While the EPOC is a tempting surrogate research EEG device, two primary
questions must be answered regarding its appropriateness. Firstly, the data retrieved from
the EPOC must be comparable to data from research-grade EEG systems. Fortunately,
this appears to be the case. De Vos, Kroesen, Emkes, and Debener (2014) demonstrated
that the EEG amplifiers used in both the EPOC and a wired research-grade EEG system
provide comparable measures of the auditory P300 component. While the De Vos et al.
(2014) study used two systems sequentially, Badcock et al. (2013; 2015) simultaneously
recorded with EPOC and a research-grade Neuroscan system, finding that late auditory
ERPs were similar between the systems. Also using simultaneous recordings, de Lissa et
al. (2015) found that EPOC reliably records face-sensitive occipito-temporal N170 peaks
(when modified to incorporate an alternative reference system to the standard mastoid
sensors), recording both face-sensitivity and face-inversion effects which did not differ
from those recorded with a Neuroscan system. Thus, multiple groups have demonstrated
that the EPOC is suitable to measure ERP effects in auditory and visual modalities.
While research-grade EEG recording usually takes place in an electricallyshielded room, one advantage of relatively inexpensive consumer-grade EEG headsets
such as the EPOC system is its portability and ease of set-up. For example, de Wit et al.
(2017) demonstrated the efficacy of using the EPOC in the classroom for teaching
neuroscience to undergraduate students. Further Dikker et al. (2017) used multiple EPOC
systems concurrently to show neural-synchrony across students in a classroom setting.
While there is a clear potential for such systems to efficiently gather data in remote
locations such as the personal homes of patients, it is necessary to evaluate how data
collection in remote contexts that are not electromagnetically-shielded compares with
typical research settings. As mentioned above, most EEG recordings take place in

electrically-shielded rooms. This is done to attenuate the amount of electrical noise that
EEG devices pick up (Jackson & Bolger, 2014), which may be greater than the relatively
weak electrical signals output from the brain. Though not all modern research-grade EEG
systems use electrical shielding, and its necessity can be questioned (Ledwidge &
Ramsay, 2018), whether consumer-grade EEG systems such as the EPOC record
research-grade signals without electrical shielding is unknown. Previous research
mentioned above has of course used the EPOC outside of electrically shielded
environments however, surprisingly, a direct comparison of shielded and unshielded
conditions has yet to be performed and would provide added confidence in non-laboratory
research programs.
The EPOC uses a driven right leg (DRL) noise-cancellation system, similar to
BioSemi EEG systems (www.biosemi.com). While DRL is aimed at attenuating ambient
electrical noise via active cancelation, the quality of the system in EPOC is yet to be
systematically tested. Such a comparison is critical for determining the reliability of EEG
recordings beyond research settings. Establishing that shielding is not required for reliable
EEG recording provides assurance for using EPOC outside traditional settings, for
example, in classrooms (e.g., de Wit et al., 2017; Dikker et al., 2017).
To address this question, we compared EPOC’s ERP recordings in two settings;
an electrically-shielded laboratory and an unshielded quite room. Specifically, we use a
similar paradigm to de Lissa et al. (2015), comparing the N170 amplitude and latency to
upright and inverted human- and wristwatch-face stimuli. The occipito-temporal N170
(negative brain potential occurring approximately 170 ms after stimulus onset) is reliably
larger for faces than other objects (Bentin, Allison, Puce, Perez, & McCarthy, 1996;
Eimer, 1998; Rossion & Jacques, 2007). The N170 is also sensitive to face inversion,

which delays the timing of the peak and often enhances its amplitude (Itier, Latinus &
Taylor, 2006; Itier & Taylor, 2004; Linkenkaer-Hansen et al. 1998; Rossion et al., 2000).
The N170 is therefore a good candidate for comparing the effect of recording context with
EPOC. However, a common issue in classical statistical analysis is an inability to
determine when two things do not significantly differ. Therefore, in the current article,
we assessed the degree of difference between the N170 signals obtained in both
conditions using Bayesian statistics. This allowed us to quantify to what degree we should
favor the null hypothesis (no difference) compared to the alternative hypothesis
(difference). In addition, the similarity of the waveforms of ERPs recorded in the two
contexts was assessed through intra-class correlations (Shrout & Fleiss, 1979).
By recording the face-sensitivity and face-inversion effects of the N170 in
shielded and unshielded contexts, we have found that EPOC records comparable patterns
of face-sensitivity and face-inversion effects in both contexts. This was established at
both the mean and single-trial level. Further, the intra-class correlation was high,
indicating similar waveforms in both contexts. These results suggest that EPOC would be
well-suited to record reliable EEG data in at least some contexts outside of typical
research settings and may be warranted in such places as schools or doctor’s surgeries.

2.1. Participants
Our sample size was based on a set timeframe (one month), in which we expected
to be able to collect 15 participants. We applied a Bayesian stopping rule to decide
whether additional data would be required, however the number of participants proved
adequate. Seventeen Macquarie University undergraduate students ended up taking part
in the study; however, only 13 (mean age = 23.2 years, SD = 7.9, 18-49, 8 female, 2 lefthanded) were used due to hardware issues.1 All participants had normal or corrected-tonormal vision. The order of testing of the recording context was counter-balanced, with
7 participating in the Shielded then Unshielded order, and 6 in the Unshielded then
Shielded order.
2.2. Stimuli
The stimuli used in the current study were identical to those in the study by de
Lissa et al. (2015), which consisted of 300 gray-scale images divided into four conditions
containing 75 unique images each. The images were either upright (50%) or inverted
(50%) wristwatches or emotionally-neutral Caucasian faces, which were cropped within
a standard-sized oval frame only showing internal parts of the faces. The four conditions
were hence upright faces, upright watches, inverted faces and inverted watches. The face
images were obtained from seven databases: NimStim (Tottenham, et al., 2002), the

For one participant, EEG was not recorded. For the remaining three, the trigger system failed and

thus data could not be timelocked. Trigger failure occurred when either the connection to the custom-made
trigger device (see below) was lost, for example if the wires lost contact with the selected trigger channels,
or if the device lost power during the session, due to the battery running out.

Computational Vision Archive (courtesy of Caltech), the MIT-CBCL (Weyrauch, et al.,
2004), the Ekman and Friesen face set (Ekman & Friesen, 1976), and a set from Kieran
Lee and David Perrett of St Andrews University. Wristwatch stimuli were obtained from
the University of Kansas Information and Telecommunication Technology Centre
database.
Trials began with a white 500-ms fixation cross in the centre of a computer screen
against a black background. This was replaced with a 200-ms upright or inverted face or
wristwatch, followed by a blank black screen until a response was made. Participants
were asked to indicate whether the image was upright or inverted via a binary keyboard
response. A response was followed by a 2000-ms “blink” screen before a new trial
commenced. The stimuli were presented by Experiment Builder software (version 1.6.1)
on a standard MacBook P8600 13-inch laptop at a distance of 40 cm from the participant.
As such, each image was 13.10 x 10.40 degrees of visual angle.
2.3. Contexts
Two contexts were used for EEG testing; an electrically-shielded research
laboratory used for electrophysiological experiments, and an unshielded room. The
unshielded room consisted of a chair and a desk in a dimmed room without electrical
shielding. There was a window to the outside, with blinds drawn. Both rooms were
comparable in size and brightness. The levels of ambient noise were consistent, and there
were no electrical devices being run in either room apart from those used for recording.

2.4. Emotiv EPOC EEG system
The Emotiv EPOC EEG system (original model, purchased 2010) uses 16 goldplated sensors (coated in an electrochemically-active material infused polymer) at
locations corresponding to AF3, AF4, F3, F4, FC5, FC6, F7, F8, T7, T8, P7, P8, O1, O2,
Common Mode Sense (CMS, left earlobe), and Driven Right Leg (DRL, right earlobe)
on the international 10-20 system. The CMS and DRL provide an active reference system.
The sensors were connected to the participants’ scalps through felt pads soaked in saline
solution, along with Signa Gel electrode gel between the felt pads and the participant’s
scalp.
EEG signals detected by the EPOC electrodes were pre-processed within the
headset (programmed by the manufacturer), passing through a 0.16-Hz high-pass filter
pre-amplification process, as well as an 83-Hz low-pass filter, before being digitized at
2048 Hz. Two notch filters were then applied at 50 and 60 Hz before further low-pass
filtering was performed with a 43-Hz cut-off. The signal was then down-sampled to 128
Hz and transmitted to a recording computer via a proprietary wireless signal. The EPOC
system uses a proprietary impedance value system.
The Emotiv EPOC EEG device was modified for the current study in two ways.
(1) The marker-triggering circuit involved injecting electrical signals into two EEG
channels (T7 and T8) at the onset of a stimulus (Badcock et al., 2013; de Lissa et al.,
2015; Thie, 2013). These signals were used to create epochs for ERP analysis. The marker
system used here was identical to that used in previous work (for technical details, see de
Lissa et al., 2015). Triggers were sent via a phototransistor which was activated by a white
square presented in the corner of the screen with each stimulus. This white square was
occluded by the phototransistor.

(2) The online reference system EPOC was modified to use the left and right
earlobes as CMS (Common Mode Sense) and DRL (Direct Right leg) locations,
respectively. This was done to avoid using the standard EPOC reference systems of either
the left mastoid or left P3 electrode areas, which are not optimal locations when recording
occipito-temporal N170 peaks due to their proximity to the epicentres of this activity as
measured from the scalp (Joyce & Rossion, 2005). The modifications were achieved by
re-routing the left (CMS) and right (DRL) sensors of the EPOC system to the participants’
left and right earlobes by wiring shortened (approximately 5 cm) Ag-AgCl EasyCap
electrodes into the fixed M1 and M2 sensors (for further details, see de Lissa et al., 2015).
2.5. EEG offline processing
The EEG data was processed offline with EEGLAB version 14.1.2 software
(Delorme & Makeig, 2004). The EEG data incorporated the left earlobe as an online
common-mode sense reference point online and was filtered through a band-pass of 0.1–
30 Hz with a 12 dB/octave roll-off. EEG artefacts were excluded by visual analysis and
then ocular artefact correction was performed through independent component analysis
(ICA; Viggario, 1997; Delorme & Makeig, 2004). Epochs were created (-102 – 602 ms,
relative to stimulus onset) and baseline-corrected to the 102 ms period preceding stimulus
onset. Epochs containing EEG signals exceeding +/-150 µV were excluded from further
analysis. The accepted epochs for each participant were averaged to produce ERPs for P7
and P8 for each condition and context.
Amplitudes, latencies, the number of accepted epochs, and the signal to noise ratio
(SNR) were analyzed. Amplitudes were taken as the average activation surrounding the
N170, 125 to 195 ms following stimulus onset. N170 latencies were taken as the timepoint

of minimum activation within the same time-period. The number of accepted epochs is
those included in the average waveforms after epochs with extreme values were removed,
or those missing due to misalignment of the infrared event-marking system. The SNR
was calculated as the root mean squared (RMS) of the signal from 102 ms to 203 ms,
divided by the standard deviation of the signal from -102 ms to 0 ms, on each trial
separately at the P7 and P8 electrodes (see Maidhof, Rieger, Prinz, & Koelsch, 2009;
Marco-Pallares, Cucurell, Münte, Strien, & Rodriguez-Fornells, 2011).
In addition to the average activations, we also calculated the N170 amplitude on
each individual trial at the P7 and P8 electrodes, which were then used for linear mixed
effects (LME) modelling, see next section. Further, the SNR was calculated on a singletrial basis as per for the mean waveforms.
2.6. Data analysis
Intra-class correlations (ICCs) were also included as a descriptor of the shape and
amplitude of the waveforms between contexts (as in previous work: Badcock et al., 2013;
2015; Bishop & McArthur, 2005; de Lissa et al., 2015; McArthur & Bishop, 2005).
There were three sets of inferential tests on the averaged data. The first was to
confirm the N170 effects. This included testing (1) whether faces produced greater N170
amplitudes than wristwatches; (2) whether faces, but not wristwatches, produced greater
N170 amplitudes for upright versus inverted images; and (3) whether faces, but not
wristwatches, produced longer N70 latencies for upright versus inverted images.
The second tested whether context (i.e., recording in shielded versus unshielded
room) affected N170 amplitude, latency, or the number of accepted epochs. All inferential
tests included specific main effects and/or interactions (rather than an omnibus set of

comparisons) and we report the standard significance test of analyses of variance
(ANOVA) as well as Bayesian ANOVAs. Bayesian statistics were included to confirm
any null effects; i.e., a Bayes Factor less than 0.3. Bayes Factors greater than 3 were
treated as evidence of differences. The analyses were conducted in RStudio (R Core
Team, 2019; RStudio Team, 2015) and the BayesFactor package (Version 0.9.12-4.2,
Morey & Rouder, 2018), using the default settings.
The final test on the averaged data was a comparison between the SNR under the
shielded and unshielded contexts. This was done using a classical paired t-test, using R,
and a Bayesian paired t-test using the BayesFactor package.
In addition to the statistical tests on the averaged data, we built an LME on singletrial N170 amplitude data and the SNR. Starting from the null model which only included
subjects as a random effect, fixed effects were added sequentially, including interactions,
and only kept if the model fit was significantly improved, as indicated by a significant Χ2
result and a decrease in the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). If multiple factors
would result in a significant effect, the factor which decreased the BIC the most was kept.
Amplitude and SNR were used as dependent factors, while stimulus type, stimulus
orientation, the orientation of the stimuli, hemisphere (P7/P8), and recording context were
successively added as independent factors. The subjects were included as random effects.
Models were fit using the lme4 (Bates et al., 2015) package in R, and the significance of
each effect in the winning model was calculated using the lmertest package (Kuznetsova,
Brockhoff, & Christensen, 2017).

3. Results
Average ERP waveforms for the left and right hemispheres (i.e., P7 vs. P8) by
stimulus type (i.e., faces vs. watches) by stimulus orientation (i.e., upright vs. inverted)
by recording context (i.e., shielded vs. unshielded room) are presented in Figure 1. Key
waveform differences (i.e., Faces vs. Wristwatches and Upright vs. Inverted Faces) are
presented in Figure 2. Column scatter plots for the key variables of interest for amplitude
and latency are reported in Figure 3 and Figure 4 respectively. The amplitude and latency
patterns by stimulus type and orientation were consistent with the background literature
on the N170 face effect. The intra-class correlations (ICCs) comparing the waveforms in
shielded and unshielded contexts were medium in strength and all significant based on
the confidence intervals not overlapping with zero (see Table 1).

3.1. Discarded epochs
Context did not affect the number of EEG epochs rejected in the artefact-rejection
processe (detailed in Section 2.5); F(1, 12) = 2.45, p = 0.12, 𝜂p2 = 0.01, BF10 = 0.52 (note:
this is an inclusive BF10 but, given the weak effect size, the practical impact of any
difference is negligible). The means of accepted epochs were therefore comparable
between contexts: 54.90 (SD = 7.62, min = 32, max = 60) epochs were retained in the
shielded context, 55.69 (SD = 4.73, min = 42, max = 60) in the unshielded context.

upright vs. inverted); F(3, 12) = 4.9, p < .001, 𝜂p2 = 0.07, BF10 = 3.7; being significant for
faces (i.e., longer latency for inverted faces); F(1, 12) = 15.23, p < .001, 𝜂p2 = 0.14, BF10
= 127.83; and again, not for watches; F(1, 12) = 0.05, p = 0.82, 𝜂p2 = 0, BF10 = 0.21. There
was no effect of Context on N170 latency; F(1, 12) = 0.3, p = 0.58, 𝜂p2 = 0, BF10 = 0.17.

3.4 SNR
The SNR was not significantly affected by context: shielded (M = 5.08, SD =
0.65) vs. unshielded (M = 5.35, SD = 0.57), t(12) = .592, p = 0.565, d = 0.14, BF10 = 0.32.
The BF provides moderate evidence against an actual difference in SNR between the two
contexts.
3.5 Single-trial Amplitude LME
Compared to the null model, the addition of hemisphere (i.e., electrodes) reduced
the BIC, Χ2(1, 4) = 178.7, p < .001, ΔBIC = -169. In the next step, the addition stimulus
type maximally decreased BIC, Χ2(2, 6) = 89.50, p < .001, ΔBIC = -71. From this model,
neither the addition of context, Χ2(4, 10) = 8.36, p = .079, ΔBIC = +30, nor the addition
of stimulus orientation, Χ2(4, 10) = 9.37, p = .052, ΔBIC = +29, improved model fit, and
thus were not included.
The final model showed that the mean amplitude of the N170 was lower (i.e.,
larger) following the presentation of faces (-11.65 µV) compared to watches (-9.00 µV, p
< .001). Further, the N170 was larger in the P8 electrode (-12.11 µV) compared to the P7
electrode (-8.52 µV, p < .001). The interaction between these two factors was not
significant (p = .601).
3.6 Single-trial SNR LME
For SNR, only the addition of context resulted in a significant Χ2 effect, however
this failed to improve the BIC, Χ2(1, 4) = 8.07, p = .004, ΔBIC = +2. Therefore, no model
appeared to parsimoniously improve the model fit beyond the null model. However,
because the context in which the recording occurred was of primary concern to the article
at hand, we examined the results of this model. It showed that the SNR was higher in the

non-shielded context (M = 2.01, SD = 0.66) rather than in the shielded context (M = 1.91,
SD = 0.58).
4. Discussion
In the current article we asked whether electrical shielding significantly affects the
electrophysiological recordings provided by Emotiv’s EPOC EEG system. To answer this
question, participants performed the same task twice, once in a shielded room and once
in an unshielded room. Participants were required to observe upright and inverted,
human- and wristwatch-faces, a task previously used to demonstrate that EPOC provides
EEG recordings comparable to a research-grade system in shielded laboratories (de Lissa
et al., 2015).
Results indicate that classic face-sensitive N170 effects were found in electrodes
P7 and P8; faces resulted in larger amplitude N170 responses, and inverted faces resulted
in longer latencies than upright faces (e.g., Bentin et al., 1996; Eimer, 1998; Itier et al.,
2006, Itier & Taylor, 2004; Linkenkaer-Hansen et al., 1998; Rossion et al., 2000).
However, more relevant to our research question, the findings demonstrated that the
EPOC provides comparable EEG recordings in shielded and unshielded environments.
Firstly, we showed that the overall waveforms in each context were highly correlated; the
data provided by the EPOC followed the same pattern whether recorded in a shielded or
unshielded environment. Further, comparing the face-sensitive N170 in both contexts
showed no significant difference in either amplitude or latency. Consistently, Bayesian
analyses provided moderate support (in accordance with the Jeffreys, 1961, Bayes factor

interpretation) for no difference.2 Finally, the Bayesian analysis also provided moderate
support against an actual difference in SNR between the shielded and unshielded contexts.
Analyzing the data at a single trial level, we found an effect of stimulus type (i.e.,
faces > watches), and similarly, a larger effect at electrode P8 compared to P7. However,
the single trial analysis did not provide evidence for a difference in N170 based on
whether shielding was present. Taken together, the evidence appears to show that the
EPOC and its DRL noise-cancellation system, is appropriate for use outside a shielded
research laboratory, at least in a quiet room.
This finding has ramifications for both the interpretation of prior research, and the
acceptability of unorthodox research environments. As mentioned in the introduction,
EPOC has previously been used to record EEG while participants walk outside (Debener
et al., 2012; De Vos et al., 2014). While this is an important demonstration, it is useful to
know that these results are most likely equivalent to those gained in a research laboratory
content. Further, knowing that the recording achieved in an unshielded room is
comparable to in a laboratory setting is useful for those who wish to employ EEG in
learning environments (e.g., de Wit et al., 2017; Dikker et al., 2017).
An additional important point is that there are many barriers to entry for wouldbe scientists; specialty knowledge, time, access to resources, to name a few. However,
research such as that conducted here can serve as a small step to remove the hold
institutions traditionally have on ‘doing science.’ Showing that EEG can be comparably

2

It is worth noting that Bayes Factor was inconclusive in regards to the number of epochs

discarded given a shielded or unshielded context, though the difference was negligible from a practical
perspective.

EPOC outside the shield

recorded outside the laboratory with a relatively small investment is an important step in
the democratization of science.
While these results are promising, it is worth noting some relevant future
extensions to the current research. Firstly, we have clarified that the EPOC system is
suitable for use outside of electrical shielding. This aligns with previously work (e.g.,
Debner et al., 2012; De Vos et al., 2014), but adds a direct control comparison of a
shielded environment. While the Emotiv systems are currently popular for research
purposes, other brands of consumer-grade EEG have yet to be tested. Secondly, our
unshielded environment was relatively conducive to research. How EPOC would fare in
a busier environment is unknown. While the current research seems to indicate the
recording would be of a comparable quality to a shielded room, how the general noise
(electrical or otherwise) around the recording device affects the recording is not directly
tested. As another further direction for this research, it would be interesting to
systematically vary the noise injected into the headset in multiple locations, such as
shielded rooms, outdoors or classrooms, and examine whether the variance of this noise
is similar across locations.
5. Conclusion
In the current article, we compared the performance of the Emotiv EPOC
consumer-grade EEG system in shielded and unshielded recording contexts. Analysis of
both the N170 face-sensitive event-related potentials showed that EPOC performs
comparably in both contexts. This provides empirical evidence validating the use of the
EPOC in the unshielded setting and allows for research-backed comparisons between
research conducted using this device in laboratory and non-laboratory settings.
