Digital health technologies for people with epilepsy (PWE) include internet-based
resources and mobile apps for seizure management. Since non-pharmacological
interventions, such as listening to specific Mozart’s compositions, cognitive therapy,
psychosocial and educational interventions were shown to reduce epileptic seizures,
these modalities can be integrated into mobile software and delivered by mobile
medical apps as digital therapeutics. Herein, we describe: (1) a survey study among
PWE about preferences to use mobile software for seizure control, (2) a rationale
for developing digital therapies for epilepsy, (3) creation of proof-of-concept mobile
software intended for use as an adjunct digital therapeutic to reduce seizures, and
(4) broader applications of digital therapeutics for the treatment of epilepsy and other
chronic disorders. A questionnaire was used to survey PWE with respect to preferred
features in a mobile app for seizure control. Results from the survey suggested that
over 90% of responders would be interested in using a mobile app to manage their
seizures, while 75% were interested in listening to specific music that can reduce
seizures. To define digital therapeutic for the treatment of epilepsy, we designed and
created a proof-of-concept mobile software providing digital content intended to reduce
seizures. The rationale for all components of such digital therapeutic is described.
The resulting web-based app delivered a combination of epilepsy self-care, behavioral
interventions, medication reminders and the antiseizure music, such as the Mozart’s
sonata K.448. To improve long-term patient engagement, integration of mobile medical
app with music and multimedia streaming via smartphones, tablets and computers is
also discussed. This work aims toward development and regulatory clearance of software
as medical device (SaMD) for seizure control, yielding the adjunct digital therapeutic for
epilepsy, and subsequently a drug-device combination product together with specific

antiseizure medications. Mobile medical apps, music, therapeutic video games and
their combinations with prescription medications present new opportunities to integrate
pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for PWE, as well as those living
with other chronic disorders, including depression and pain.

INTRODUCTION

of digital therapeutics include their ability to integrate patient
behavior and lifestyle changes with pharmacotherapy (Bulaj,
2014; Bulaj et al., 2016; Mantani et al., 2017; McKennon et al.,
2017).
Digital health technologies for PWE comprise mobile
apps and internet-based resources delivering epilepsy selfmanagement content (Pandher and Bhullar, 2014; Escoffery et al.,
2018; Le Marne et al., 2018; Page et al., 2018). Survey-based
studies suggest that PWE and their caregivers are interested
in mHealth, but only a small fraction use mobile apps for
seizure management (Liu et al., 2015, 2016; Leenen et al.,
2016). Pandher and Bhullar reviewed features of 28 mobile apps
for seizure management (Pandher and Bhullar, 2014). Content
of mobile apps could be categorized into patient education
(e.g., general information, seizure triggers, medications, first
aid) and self-monitoring (seizure and medication tracking). The
authors found relatively low quality of educational components
in the apps, whereas seizure diaries were the most commonly
incorporated features (Pandher and Bhullar, 2014). Recently,
20 mobile apps for epilepsy self-management were reviewed
with respect to self-management functions and behavior
change strategies, as well as evaluated for their engagement,
functionality, esthetics, information quality and satisfaction
using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) (Escoffery et al.,
2018). An example of online self-management platform for
epilepsy patients is WebEase (Epilepsy Awareness, Support and
Education) delivering three modules focused on medications,
stress and sleep (DiIorio et al., 2009a,b). Another web-based
intervention is the Epilepsy Journey, targeting executive function
deficits in adolescents with epilepsy (Modi et al., 2017).
Feasibility of mobile and internet-based delivery of psychosocial
interventions and cognitive behavioral therapy for PWE further
emphasizes opportunities for digital interventions (Hixson et al.,
2015; Gandy et al., 2016; Glynn et al., 2016). Wearables intended
to detect and predict seizures have been developed, for example
SmartWatch and the FDA-cleared Embrace by Empatica. To the
best of our knowledge there are no published studies on effects of
digital health technologies on reduction of seizure frequency.
For PWE, digital health technologies offer opportunities
to improve therapy outcomes by integrating prescription
medications with specific musical compositions (Bulaj, 2014).
As summarized in Table 1 and described in the Results section,
there are several published reports on antiseizure effects of
Mozart’s sonata K.448 on reducing seizure frequencies and
epileptiform discharges in PWE. Antiseizure effects of K.448
were observed in children with refractory epilepsy (Lin et al.,
2011a), and in those after first unprovoked seizures (Lin et al.,
2014a). The clinical findings are also supported by animal

Among people with epilepsy (PWE) and their healthcare
providers, there are overlapping needs for better control of:
(1) seizures, (2) medication adherence and (3) comorbidities.
According to the World Health Organization, there are 50–60
million people living with epilepsy world-wide, and only 70%
of them respond to current treatments to control their seizures.
In the United States alone, there are an estimated 3.4 million
PWE, and approximately 150,000 people are diagnosed with
epilepsy each year (Epilepsy Foundation, www.epilepsy.com).
Newly-diagnosed patients have approximately 50% chance to
become seizure free after taking their first antiseizure medication
(Brodie et al., 2012, 2013; Chen et al., 2017). Recent work
suggests that even after becoming seizure-free, over 60% of
patients who discontinue taking antiseizure drugs experienced
at least one relapse over a period of 3 years (Park et al.,
2017). The diverse etiologies and complex mechanisms of
epileptic seizures pose a challenge to reach long-term seizure
freedom in approximately 20–30% of PWE (Golyala and Kwan,
2017; Tang et al., 2017). For patients with refractory epilepsy,
possible non-pharmacological options to control seizures include
dietary interventions (DeGiorgio et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2016;
Martin et al., 2016), implantable neuromodulation devices, or
brain surgery. Approximately 30% of PWE do not adhere
to medication schedules, leading to decreased seizure control
(Ettinger et al., 2009; Malek et al., 2017; O’ Rourke and O’
Brien, 2017). In addition to seizures, PWE often experience
depression and anxiety as comorbidities, requiring additional
interventions (Kanner, 2016). Taken together, there are multiple
needs to develop new therapies with improved efficacy and
clinical outcomes for PWE.
Digital health (also mobile health, mHealth, or eHealth,)
is a branch of healthcare that employs internet, digital, and
mobile technologies for improving health and/or treating specific
medical conditions. Many digital health technologies are focused
on wellness and health coaching, or disease self-management.
mHealth comprises mobile medical apps which receive clearance
(as SaMD) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Examples of SaMD are mobile medical apps, such as BlueStar R
(developed by WellDoc) to improve control of glucose blood
levels in patients with type 2 diabetes, or reSET R for substance
use (addiction), developed by Pear Therapeutics. Musicbased videogame MusicGlove and Jinxtronix neurorehabilitation
system are examples of the FDA-cleared stroke therapies. Benefits

FIGURE 1 | Scheme illustrating integration of behavioral interventions,
self-care (self-management and self-efficacy) and antiseizure music into mobile
medical app (SaMD) and a drug-device combination product for epilepsy. An
incentive for clinical development and regulatory approval of such digital
therapeutics and their combinations with brand and generic drugs is the
potential for long-lasting intellectual property protection based on copyrights of
creative works and software (Bulaj, 2014; Bulaj et al., 2016).

drug-SaMD combination product offers means to: (1) integrate
pharmacological and behavioral therapies with self-care, (2)
create new personalized treatments for epilepsy, and (3) improve
medication adherence and patient engagement. Our work has
implications beyond epilepsy, since combining prescription
medications and music-based interventions is also applicable to
the treatment of depression (Schriewer and Bulaj, 2016), pain
(Chai et al., 2017) and potentially other neurological disorders
(Sihvonen et al., 2017).

studies suggesting that Mozart’s K.448 can reduce seizure
frequencies in rats (Lin et al., 2013), upregulates expression of
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in rats (Xing et al.,
2016a,b,c), reduces cognitive impairment in status epilepticus
rats (Xing et al., 2016b), increases brain levels of dopamine in
rats (Tasset et al., 2012), and modulates expression of several
genes involved in neurotransmission in the hippocampus and
the forebrain cortex in mice (Meng et al., 2009). The possible
mechanism by which music exerts antiseizure effects may include
neuromodulation of the parasympathetic system (Lin et al., 2013;
Dastgheib et al., 2014).
In this work, we describe initial steps in development of
digital therapeutics for epilepsy, including the survey-based
study and design of prototype mobile software intended to
reduce seizures. We provide a rationale for mobile medical app
content which integrates antiseizure music, epilepsy self-care
and elements of cognitive behavioral therapy. As illustrated in
Figure 1, our long term goal is to develop SaMD as adjunct digital
therapeutic for the treatment of epilepsy, followed by integration
of specific antiseizure drugs with SaMD, yielding, from a
regulatory perspective, a drug-device combination product. The

METHODS
The Survey Study
The study was conducted in the University of Utah Adult
Comprehensive Epilepsy Clinic. The institutional review board
(IRB) at University of Utah reviewed and approved the study.
The study was determined to be “exempt” by the IRB due to its
minimal risk to participants. The IRB approved an authorization
cover letter for participants to sign prior to completing the
study questionnaire. The study information was kept in secured
manner and electronic records of patients were password
protected. The questionnaire was designed and consisted of seven
questions related to preferences in using mobile apps for seizure
management and control (Supplementary Information). The
questionnaire collection forms were created for each participant
and information was directly captured in the electronic clinical

individuals participated in this study. The survey results show
that over 90% of patients were interested in using a mobile
app to help manage their seizures. In relation to monitoring
epilepsy, 85% of patients were interested in diary to record date
of their seizures, 73% were interested in recording type of their
seizures, 78% were interested in logging the missed dosages of
their medications. Regarding automated reminders, a majority
was interested in reminders to keep their follow up appointments
(80%), to refill their medications (73%), to take their medication
on time (68%).
In relation to understanding their disease, 68% of responders
were interested in delivery of brief epilepsy and seizurerelated information (Figure 2), 84% were interested about how
their feelings and environment affect their epilepsy, 63% were
interested in learning about feelings related to their epilepsy,
while 42% were interested in being inspired by quotations
and imagery. Additionally, 5% of participants did not find
informative features applicable to them and therefore left this
section blank.
Two questions related to music-based intervention were
focused on seizure control and comparing music with other
relaxation techniques like imagery, games and puzzles, and
practicing mindfulness. About 75% of responders were interested
in music that may help seizure control and 68% were interested
in relaxing music that may help alleviate stress, while 40%
of patients were interested in relaxing imagery that may help
alleviate stress (Figure 2). 70% of patients were interested in
playing relaxing games and puzzles, while 35% were interested
in drawing or writing while listening to music. About 63% were
interested in practicing mindfulness.
To determine potential adherence to music-based
intervention, we asked participants how long they would
be willing to listen to antiseizure music, if it was delivered daily
for 10 min. Previous studies on the effects of Mozart music on
seizure reduction suggested that music intervention was effective
when delivered for at least 1 month, while most studies tested
antiseizure effects of music delivered for either 6 or 12 months
(Lin et al., 2011a; Bodner et al., 2012; Dastgheib et al., 2014;
D’Alessandro et al., 2017). As shown in Figure 2, a majority of
responders (65%) imagined using it for several months or longer
(including 45% who imagined such therapy lasting for 1 year
or longer). 13% of responders could use it for several weeks or
longer, while 23% for several days or longer. In summary, the
questionnaire responses confirmed PWE’s interest in using a
mobile app for seizure control, management and self-care.

data management tool REDCap (Research Electronic Data
Capture Software). This study was conducted between months
June and August 2017, and involved PWE aged 18 years and
older who were regular smartphone users. Patients without access
to smartphones, and/or who were cognitively impaired were
excluded from the study population. A total of 40 individuals
participated in this study.
After signing consent, each participant was first provided with
brief introduction about the purpose of this study. Any person
who did not agree to participate in this study was excluded.
Participant’s protected health information (PHI) was linked to
their questionnaire to avoid data duplication for which the
IRB has approved an authorization cover letter for participants
to sign prior to enrollment. Questions were explained to the
participants by the moderator, who was a student trained in
qualitative research methods. The epilepsy attending and/or
study coordinator and/or a student were present during data
collection. The participants were asked to select the options that
they felt were most beneficial and desirable for them, and features
they wanted in the mobile app. The questionnaire answers were
completed by the participants using the REDCap. While the
authors had a positive attitude toward mobile app, they strived
to remain neutral in conversation with the participants. Data
analysis and reports were viewed on REDCap Stats and Charts.

Design of Mobile Software Prototype
Using PubMed, literature search was performed to identify
clinical studies of non-pharmacological interventions that
reported seizure reduction in PWE. The following key words
were used alone and in combination with “epilepsy” or “epileptic
seizures”: self-management, self-efficacy, self-care, psychosocial,
cognitive behavioral therapy, educational intervention, webbased intervention, internet, music, Mozart. Information from
the published studies reporting a reduction of seizure frequency
was analyzed and incorporated into software content. When
designing the prototype mobile software we hypothesized that
the duration of the digital therapy would last preferably 1
year, or longer, during which time a patient would be engaged
with the mobile app for approximately 10 min daily. Therefore,
user experience (UX) interface, interactivity, gamification and
novel daily content were important factors to maximize patient’s
engagement. To create a prototype of the mobile software, a webbased version was built using HTML5 and hosted on a sharedserver Linux platform. Visual displays of the digital content were
discussed among software and UX engineers and clinical team
members.

The Survey Study

A Rationale for Integrating
Non-pharmacological Interventions Into
Mobile Software

The main purpose of our survey study was to evaluate the
patient’s interest in using a mobile app for seizure control
and self-care. Our questionnaire was focused on questions
about preferred features in a mobile app related to seizure
management, wellbeing, self-awareness, empowerment, and
engagement in the therapy. All questions and answers are
provided in the Supplementary Information. A total of 40

PubMed literature search identified non-pharmacological
interventions that resulted in reducing the frequency of seizures
in PWE (Tables 1, 2). Our hypothesis is that incorporating nonpharmacological interventions and self-care into mobile software
can yield digital therapeutics (SaMD) for epilepsy (Figure 1).
Clinical studies showed that daily listening to Mozart’s sonata
K.448 significantly reduced frequency of epileptic seizures

and/or epileptiform discharges in adult and pediatric patients
with epilepsy (Table 1). Listening to K.448 was effective in
reducing seizure frequency even after 1 month, and further
improved seizure frequency over 6 month treatment time (Lin
et al., 2011a). Studies also showed that additional Mozart’s
compositions, including K.207, K.218, K.314, K.482, K. 545, and
K.551 had positive effects on children with epilepsy, including
reduction of epileptiform discharges and reduction of seizure
frequency (Lin et al., 2012; Coppola et al., 2015, 2018). Possible
mechanisms by which music may exert its antiseizure effect
include activation of the parasympathetic system (Lin et al.,
2013), stabilization of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
axis (Maguire and Salpekar, 2013; Wulsin et al., 2016), or include
dopaminergic signaling through D2-like receptors (Salimpoor
et al., 2011; Bozzi and Borrelli, 2013).
Studies of psychosocial interventions, behavioral cognitive
therapy and self-management for PWE (Kotwas et al., 2017;
Michaelis et al., 2017) suggest that self-care practices may
lead to reduction of seizure frequency (Mittan, 2009; Edward
et al., 2015; Table 2, Figure 3). In the review of psychosocial
interventions in epilepsy (Mittan, 2009), the author found five
studies reporting positive findings out of seven studies that
measured seizure control. A significant reduction of seizures
in older adult patients with epilepsy was observed at 3month follow up after 6-week cognitive behavioral therapy
intervention (McLaughlin and McFarland, 2011). Positive results
in seizure reduction were observed in randomized trial of
behavioral interventions in patients with the refractory epilepsy
(Gillham, 1990). Another randomized trial of behavioral therapy
(acceptance and commitment therapy) showed a significant
reduction of seizure frequency in patients with the refractory
epilepsy (Lundgren et al., 2008). Behavioral and educational
interventions were effective in reducing seizures in both pediatric
and adult populations (Spector et al., 1999, 2001; Tieffenberg
et al., 2000; May and Pfafflin, 2002), also emphasizing importance
of self-efficacy, knowledge, understanding and management of
emotional health (Spector et al., 2000, 2001; McLaughlin and
McFarland, 2011). Noteworthy, targeting the HPA axis for
reduction of seizures has been proposed (Maguire and Salpekar,
2013; Wulsin et al., 2016). As summarized in Figure 3, when
designing the prototype mobile software for epilepsy patients, we
incorporated key behavioral and self-care aspects that support
seizure control through a combination of education, awareness
and behavioral interventions.

as compared to control group (social support)

Haut et al., 2018

Two behavioral interventions, progressive muscle
relaxation and focused attention, produced
significant reduction of seizures (by 25–29%) in
patients with drug-resistant focal seizures

FIGURE 3 | Epilepsy self-care comprises self-management components and
patient’s self-efficacy. Patient’s behaviors and life-style may improve seizure
control by identifying and managing seizure triggers. Patient’s perceived
self-control of epileptic seizures, awareness of behavior and emotional status
and self-esteem contribute to health-related locus of control and self-efficacy.
Psychosocial and behavioral therapy studies identify key elements that
contribute to seizure control. Additional patient behavioral component is daily
listening to antiseizure music, such as Mozart’s sonata K.448.

Design of the Prototype Mobile Software
We designed and created the proof-of-concept software, which
consisted of two main modules: (1) self-care (education and selfexamining), and (2) leisure activities while listening to a total of
10 min of antiseizure music. As shown in Figure 4, key elements
of the proof-of-concept mobile software included: (1) welcoming
front page, (2) epilepsy-focused educational content, (3) selfmanagement provided as self-examination, (4) improving selfesteem and self-efficacy, (5) listening to antiseizure music,
(6) gamification, and (7) summary page. Examples of webbased screens are illustrated in Figure 5. Opening page was
designed to welcome a patient while summarizing cumulative

“score” of being engaged with the mobile app (Figure 4). Entering
next pages automatically started playing antiseizure music, and
for the proof-of-concept mobile software we looped the first
movement of Mozart’s sonata K.448. The next page provided
“daily educational information” related to epilepsy and focused
on the epilepsy knowledge, therapy, self-care and advances

Developing Digital Therapeutics for Epilepsy

evidence from preclinical and clinical studies supports the
development of digital therapeutics for epilepsy delivering
specific musical compositions. However, listening daily to the
same music (e.g., Mozart’s K.448) for several months may
produce undesirable and even maladaptive effects including a
lack of interest, irritation and “desensitization” of physiological
effects. Results from a recent animal study suggest that
the CNS effects of K.448 may be in part due to the so
called Mozart rhythm effect (Xing et al., 2016c). To identify
musical compositions similar to Mozart’s sonata K.448, a
neurologist/clinical neurophysiologist JR Hughes used computer
analysis of periodicity and melodic lines in 330 compositions of
Mozart, 155 of JS Bach, 61 of Beethoven, 58 of Chopin and 23
of Wagner, and selected 25 compositions with the highest values
of long-lasting periodicities (Hughes, 2001, 2002), expanding a
potential repertoire of music for clinical testing for antiseizure
properties.
Based on our observations and other studies (van Andel et al.,
2011; Walker et al., 2012, 2014), it is apparent that in addition
to PWE, their caregivers and close friends may also benefit
from using mobile software designed for epilepsy self-care. Social
support needs of PWE and caregivers offer future opportunities
to expand the mobile app content in which: (1) PWE and their
closest support group can share access to learning about epilepsy,
self-management and wellbeing, (2) PWE could connect with
their primary caregivers, while still maintaining the autonomy
to control their individual use of the app, (3) caregivers could
update seizures recordings for those that the patient might not
have been aware of, (4) PWE and their loved ones can socially
interact hence minimizing the feeling of isolation that is known
to often accompany those living with epilepsy.
Mobile software for epilepsy patients is a nonpharmacological modality that can be easily combined with
other therapies (Figure 6). The most apparent combinations
are with antiseizure medications (Bulaj, 2014), or with dietary
interventions such as ketogenic and low-glycemic diets
(DeGiorgio et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2016; Martin et al., 2016).
A rationale for combining mobile software with pleiotropic
natural products including n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
was previously discussed (DeGiorgio et al., 2014; Bulaj et al.,
2016). For patients with refractory epilepsy, mobile medical app
delivering self-care and antiseizure music can be validated for use
with neuromodulation devices like vagus nerve and deep brain
stimulation, VNS and DBS, respectively, although additional
safety and efficacy studies and regulatory authorization would
be required before marketing such combination therapies.
Recently, we described music streaming as an adjunct digital
therapy for depression, anxiety and bipolar spectrum disorders
(Schriewer and Bulaj, 2016). Music and multimedia streaming
of the antiseizure digital content can complement the use of a
mobile medical app for seizure control. In addition to increasing
patient engagement, web-based streaming offers an additional
safety feature by mitigating potentially stressful events such
as losing or breaking a mobile phone, tablet, or laptop that
hosts the SaMD. Technological advancements in wearables that
provide real-time physiological feedback (e.g., smart watches
by Empatica, or mobile EEG systems by Emotiv, Muse, or
NeuroSky) may be used to optimize streamed content, similarly

in clinical research. Next several pages were designed as selfexamination of self-care components related to seizure control
and quality of life (Figure 4). Interactive self-examining was
delivered by structuring questions as introspective: “Have I
experienced. . . .” or “How was my sleep last night?” encouraging
patient self-reflection before answering these questions. Selfexamination was focused on enjoyable activities, relaxation, daily
gratitude (reinforcing positive attitude and self-esteem), potential
seizure triggers (stress, lack of sleep, emotions, others), and
medication compliance reminders. After self-examination, the
remaining time (of a total of 10 min) of listening to the antiseizure
music could be spent on leisurely or creative activities chosen by
the patient.
The prototype mobile application was designed to create an
engaging and intuitive user experience. The web-based prototype
was built using HTML5 and hosted on a shared-server Linux
platform. The interactions were primarily audio and visual,
including progress feedback that can be monitored/recorded
using emoticon-type symbols as opposed to a more traditional
journaling process. As illustrated in Figure 5, the application’s
user interface was focused on making the experience easy and
friendly, with a clean and simple modern interface.

DISCUSSION
Despite increasing number of digital health technologies for
seizure management, we are not aware of development of
mobile medical apps intended to reduce frequency of seizures
in epilepsy patients. Our survey suggest that about two-thirds
of PWE could see themselves using such mobile software for
at least several months. Patients preferred automated features
for different aspects of seizure and disease management, and
were also interested in the relaxation features of the app. One
interesting finding was that our subjects’ interest was more
in passively listening to music than actively using imagery.
They were also more interested in playing games or puzzles, as
compared to writing or drawing while listening to music. We
concluded that in our subject population there was less interest
in relaxation techniques that used mental creativity (drawing,
writing or using imagery). There was more interest in relaxation
techniques consisting of observation (practicing mindfulness) or
immersing passively by listening to music, or engaging reactively
in puzzles and games, as compared to those techniques involving
mental creativity. The reasons for preferences toward more
passive activities are not clear at this time, but it may be that such
relaxation techniques might increase brain stem parasympathetic
activity, which in turn may have some anti-seizure effects. Bodner
and colleagues reported that antiseizure music was also effective
in reducing seizures when delivered during sleeping (Bodner
et al., 2012), suggesting that for PWE who favor less engagement
there are opportunities to develop more passive strategies (like
streaming antiseizure music during sleep).
Music is a non-pharmacological modality that produces
pleiotropic physiological effects, including activation of the
dopaminergic system and D2 receptors (Salimpoor et al., 2011).
Music-evoked neurochemical changes in the brain suggest
therapeutic potential in affective and neurological disorders

of the beta version. Since the mobile medical app is intended to be
used as add-on digital therapeutic, two main clinical outcomes to
be studied will be seizure frequency and medication adherence.
For the alpha version of the mobile medical app, the software
will be built using best-of-breed software engineering standards
and the tools necessary to support highly secure and readily
available mobile software. While the primary experience will be
native to the mobile device, the software will include a server-side
component used to manage software updates and limited user
data. The system will comply with all relevant FDA regulations
and be HIPAA compliant. Both Android and iOS devices will
be included in the initial release. The regulatory pathway will
follow the recommendations in the FDA guidance document that
can be found at www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DigitalHealth/
MobileMedicalApplications/default.htm. Anticipated challenges
during development include long-term patient engagement,
privacy protection and cybersecurity.
This paper also describes the development strategy for
merging pharmacological and behavioral therapies for PWE
by means of drug-device combination products in which an
antiseizure drug works together with a mobile medical app
(Figures 1, 6). Companies including Pear Therapeutics and
Akili Interactive already develop clinically validated mobile apps
and videogames delivering disease-specific behavioral therapy
as stand-alone “prescription digital therapeutics,” or to be
used with prescription medications. This strategy illustrates
broader impact of digital therapeutics allowing integration of
self-care and behavioral therapies with pharmaceutical drugs
(Bulaj et al., 2016). From a US FDA regulatory perspective,
approval of a drug-device combination product incorporating
a mobile medical app for use with a drug typically involves
first completing a pilot investigation to confirm the feasibility
of the approach. After device refinements, a pivotal clinical
investigation is performed to reasonably establish the safety
and effectiveness of the drug-device combination product. An
incentive for innovating therapies using digital therapeutics is
their copyright-based intellectual property protection, applicable
even to combinations with generic drugs (Bulaj, 2014).
Regulatory processes for medical devices vary from country
to country, and as digital therapy is a relatively new field,
regulatory requirements for developing and obtaining regulatory
authorization to market mobile software as a medical device
continue to evolve. Challenges associated with developing
digital therapeutics include: (1) mitigating the gap between
rapidly changing technologies and the slower-pace of clinical
development, (2) mitigating patient risks including stress
associated with losing/breaking a digital device, (3) incorporating
robust cybersecurity measures, (4) ensuring patient engagement,
and (5) health care system implementation and reimbursement.
Digital therapeutics delivering multimodal interventions,
including drug-device combination therapies, may benefit
patients with neurological and other chronic medical conditions
(Bulaj, 2014; Bulaj et al., 2016) including treatment of depression,
pain, arthritis, and diabetes, given similar comorbidities. Music
and mobile apps, such as SuperBetter (Roepke et al., 2015),
MoodHacker (Birney et al., 2016), as well as web-based
interventions (Merry et al., 2012; Buntrock et al., 2016) have

FIGURE 6 | Possible combinations of mobile medical app for the treatment of
epilepsy with pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Some
combinations may require additional safety and efficacy studies and regulatory
authorization before marketing.

FIGURE 7 | Examples of non-pharmacological interventions amenable for
integration with digital therapeutics for chronic medical conditions. Multiple
clinical studies support integration of such multimodal interventions for
depression (Pirbaglou et al., 2016; Leubner and Hinterberger, 2017; Toups
et al., 2017), pain (Cooney et al., 2013; Chai et al., 2017; Qaseem et al., 2017;
Toups et al., 2017), stroke (Pollock et al., 2014a,b; Sihvonen et al., 2017), and
Parkinson’s disease (Seidl et al., 2014; Bloem et al., 2015; Roeder et al., 2015).

to the strategy used for patients with depression (Ramirez et al.,
2015). The development of clinically-validated, multimedia
streaming with subsequent integration with the mobile app for
PWE are longer-term prospects.
In the present study, we describe the initial stage of developing
prescription digital therapeutic for the treatment of epilepsy in
patients already taking antiseizure medications. Due to multiple
challenges in developing such innovative medical technology, we
exercise step-wise and iterative approach which started with the
survey and the proof-of-concept prototype design (this work).
Before any clinical testing, the web-based prototype will be
converted into an alpha version of the mobile medical app,
due to current regulatory guidelines. The step-wise development
plan includes: (1) pilot feasibility study of the alpha version, (2)
optimization based on feedback from the pilot study, yielding
beta version, (3) a randomized, controlled pivotal (efficacy) trial

been shown to reduce or prevent depressive symptoms (Firth
et al., 2017; Leubner and Hinterberger, 2017), even in patients
with refractory depression (Mantani et al., 2017). Virtual
reality technologies improve pain relief and decrease opioid
use (McSherry et al., 2017; Tashjian et al., 2017). Music-based
interventions to manage acute and chronic pain may also
show promise (Chai et al., 2017). Listening to the Mozart
K.448 also produced beneficial clinical effects for people with
schizophrenia taking antipsychotic drugs (He et al., 2018). These
and other studies suggest that converting non-pharmacological
interventions into mobile software as medical device and
subsequent integration with antiseizure, antidepressant and
analgesic medications is an attractive strategy for improving
therapy outcomes in several neurologic disorders (Figure 7).
