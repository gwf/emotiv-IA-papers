Abstract—The development of the world of robotics is
inevitable with the rapid development of supporting science and
technology. There are various types and classifications of robots,
although the basic development is not much different. One type
of robot that is in demand and the most widely developed is the
wheeled robot. The robot component itself is generally divided
into 3 parts, the first sensor, the second processor or component
processor and actuator, in this study which behaves as an
actuator is a wheel, while that behaves as a sensor, researchers
utilize brainwave reader headsets from neurosky, and those that
served as a processor component or processor using Arduino
Uno R3. The neurosky headset works wirelessly using a
Bluetooth connection, and the data sent is in the form of a brain
wave power level (blink streght level). Before it can be translated
into a telepathic brain command, this signal is first captured and
processed using an android handset using an application that is
built based on blynk IoT, then after that the command is sent to
Arduino as a robot processing component that has previously
been fitted with HC-06 bluetooth module hardware. to capture
wireless broadcasts from an android device, only after that the
signal is processed by Arduino becomes a command to move
forward, backward, left, right wheeled robot by the L298N
motor driver. The test results in an ideal environment showed
an average system success of 85%, while testing in a non-ideal
environment (with obstacles of space and distance) showed an
average system success of 40% with each test carried out 10
times.
Keywords—Wheeled Robot, Control System, Brain Wave

INTRODUCTION

At the beginning of the creation of robots, had the initial
purpose to help even replace human tasks, for something that
is repetitive or routine, requires high accuracy and can also
replace the role of humans when having to deal with
dangerous areas, such as its use in the case of Japanese
Fukushima, where robot roles are needed to help evacuate
and evaluate nuclear reactors that have leaked due to natural
disasters. Meanwhile in the world of education, robotics
technology is introduced as one of the leading courses, as
well as research by lecturers and students to spur its
development. In the future, it does not rule out the possibility
that robot technology will further develop so that it can move
and think like humans based on the programming logic that
is entered into it.
In this study, researchers used a neurosky brainwave
headset, which was used to represent brainwave
measurements into digital signals which were then received

by the mindwave mobile application using additional
Android smartphone devices. Brainwave headset sensor
reading extracts 12 bits of data and translates them into
frequency readings in units of Hz, this headset groups them
into 7 types of frequencies; including delta, theta, alpha, low
beta, midrange beta, high beta and gamma.
Android applications specifically created by neorosky
vendors simplify the process of reading these waves, from
this can be known perimeter which can be used further for
programming and can be converted into a command for
robotic motion systems in the form of motion (forward,
backward, left and right).
In specific hardware design, it takes at least 5 main
devices that work in series, the first (1) brainwave headset,
the results of the headset reading are forwarded to (2) android
smartphone devices that have been embedded with neurosky
mobile software, from here on, using Bluetooth wireless
communication, will be received by (3) HC-06 Bluetooth
module, from this module the signal is already in digital form
and forwarded to the processing device (4) Arduino UNO R3,
because it is a processor, this device requires an instruction
or command that is typed using Arduino IDE, here also the
EEG reading results are processed into a perimeter which will
be used as a command or instruction, to govern the actuator
device in the form of (5) DC motor driver L298N into a motor
movement (CW) or clockwise or (CCW) counterclockwise
turn clockwise, or one motor moves and two motors move at
once.
This kind of research has also been carried out by Hiaishi
[1], using the same equipment, namely the brain wave
headset, but for the robotic system he uses a more practical
system, namely the NXT mindstrom, the results of 150
experiments the result is 80% accuracy. The second study by
Hadi [2] who tried to use a BCI headset (Brain Computer
Interface) with the Mindflex connector used to the computer
was then simulated using Matlab from 100 experiments with
the accuracy of up to 62%. The second research was refined
by Nakirekanti [3] who added muscle and brain components
as a command stimulus, for visualization using the Matlab
application. There are also those who use different basic
headsets, especially the P300 ERP EPOC Emotiv, in a study
by Nurseitov [4] because there are various types of brain
wave headsets on the market, we just need to be observant
about reading the available technical specifications, usually
more complex, the more expensive the price. Apart from the

type of communication based on WiFi (Wireless Fidelity),
there is also BCI based on bluetooth [5]. Of course, brain
wave reading technology can be developed in other fields [6],
especially those that help mankind apart from robotics, such
as controlling a wheelchair, helping people with disabilities
in hospitals and outpatients, as dev and rahman did [7] . It
was also carried out by Salunke [8] and Taksande [9] who
focused on BCI research to help people with disabilities. All
research shows the good performance of the BCI device, it
only needs improvements to the sensitive sensor so that it can
stop working 100%, that's what will be done in this research
activity.

waves between 8 and 12 hertz, alpha waves are associated
with psychological states of relaxation or mental calm [18].
In practical terms, the brain wave headset will later be
used to capture small electromagnetic waves generated by the
brain and translate them into digital form. The small
electromagnetic signal will be detected by the electrode
sensor.

LITERATURE REVIEW

A. Wheeled Robot
Wheeled robots are a type of classification or grouping of
robots based on the use of their actuators, many of these types
of robots are found, because they are the easiest and most
efficient to develop, moreover, their use does not require
special specifications, for example, they are only used to
cross a flat surface [10]. Today there are many types of wheel
drive for robotics needs, such as AWR (Articulated Wheeled
Robot), which has a free motion axis, its application
depending on the needs or mission of the robot [11]. To be
able to run stably, a robot can be designed not to have 4
wheels or more, it can only use 2 wheels, but with the addition
of a balancing system like a gyroscope machine [12]. Of
course, everything is adjusted to the terrain that will be
traversed by the robot, the control system will also adjust it
[13].
B. Control system
The essence of a robot is a control system, it can be said
that it is a robot's nerves. The control system functions to
control the movement and manipulator of the robot. One type
of control system that is currently widely used in robotics is
Arduino which is a platform consisting of hardware and
software components, software is used to create and insert
programs into Arduino hardware or hardware [14]. The
definition of a robot control system is also explained by
Unbehauen in his book [15] entitled "Control Systems,
Robotics And Automation". In other reference sources it is
also stated that the control system does not have to use an
operator, it can also be made automatically or a sensor-based
reaction action system [16]. Sensor-based control system is
actually inspired by the neural network of living things in
which the term sensor itself is an imitation of the five senses
of living things [17].

Fig. 1. Neurosky Product Brain Wave Headset (EEG-Headset)

In this brainwave headset, there is an N1 processor which
functions to translate analog brainwave signals into digital
signals. This processor is capable of reading 20,000 brain
signals in 1 second; The following brain signals are captured
by a brainwave headser device [19]. This is in line with what
Park said in his book [20] entitled "Computer Science and its
Applications: Ubiquitous Information Technologies", which
is a collection of articles about the 6th seminary of the FTRA
or the International Conference on Computer Science and its
Application held in Guam, USA. Union. . Still with the same
author [21] in his book entitled "Future Information
Technology - II" BCI technology and its development, is
predicted to become a commonly used technology in many
ways. This statement certainly arouses research interest in the
field of brain wave reading technology. In line with what
Gallo said in his book [22] which predicts that telepathy will
become commonplace in the future, of course what is meant
by telepathy here is the brain waves themselves.

C. Brain Wave Headset
The human brain consists of billions of interconnected
neurons, the brain consistently emits neurons when thinking,
hearing, walking and speaking. Any interaction between
neurons will produce a very small electrical discharge, even
though this small amount of electricity can be measured and
can be categorized as a wave. This wave pattern is then
marked and mapped based on the amplitude and frequency of
each resulting condition, for example a wave between 12 and
30 hertz is a beta wave, this wave is generated when a person
is concentrating. Then there are also alpha waves, namely

as a database and the system only needs to match the
sound level with the type of command [29].

The neurosky headset itself, was also introduced by Issa
in his book [24], entitled "Smart Technology Applications in
Business Environments" especially on page 52, which is also
technically clear. In another reference [25] this technology is
even predicted to be applied to the control system of
unmanned aircraft or drones, which have been commonplace
using remote control devices and control boards or control
levers, later if this technology is used the control board and
control levers are not will again be needed. Besides being
able to be combined with the latest technological devices,
brain wave headsets can also be combined with simple
devices such as the Arduino on a research scale, as described
in his book [26].

RESULT AND DISCUSSION

A. Testing Learning Loss & Learning Accuracy
Wheeled robot testing with a brainwave headset control
system is carried out in ideal conditions without obstacles and
non-ideal conditions with obstacles. Ideal conditions testing
is carried out on a flat terrain with a maximum distance
between the headset and robot devices a maximum of 10
meters without obstacles and testing on non-ideal conditions
is done by providing a limit in the form (space and distance)
between the robot and the control system. Database testing is
done by thinking about the command "forward", "backward",
"right", "left" by researchers with recording 10 times per
command. To calculate the percentage of success the
equation is used.

B. Test and Analysis Results
Based on the test results in table 2 and 3, the system
solutions issued in environmental conditions are not ideal, in
this condition it is positioned in an environment where there
is distance and obstruction between the control system or the
