ABSTRACT Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the fundamental tools for analyzing the behavior of
brain and particularly helpful for treatment of epilepsy and detection of associated seizures. For longterm recording of EEG signals, current research is heading towards simple, unobtrusive and ambulatory
devices with a small number of channels. The primary contribution of this paper is to assess the performance
difference between the seizure detection results using features from all channels versus only the channels
in/around the temporal region. For this purpose, we develop a supervised seizure detection algorithm that
uses time domain features extracted sequentially for every 1-second epoch. By using this algorithm, we
obtained sensitivity values of 0.95 and 0.92, specificity values of 0.99 and 0.99 and false positive per hour
values as 0.16 and 0.21 for all 23 channels and 10 temporal region channels, respectively. These results
show that restricting the EEG analysis to temporal region results only in a graceful and gradual degradation
of classifier performance. We conclude that EEG ambulatory devices with a montage local to the temporal
region could demonstrate satisfactory performance. This presents a promising way forward for the use of
ambulatory devices with compact wearable design.

I. INTRODUCTION

Epilepsy is one of the most common and chronic disorders
of the brain. About 1% of the world population is reported to
be suffering from this disease [1]. Epilepsy has been around
since recorded history and has been treated according to the
techniques and technology in vogue, e.g., trephining. With
the passage of time and advancement in medical science
and technology, different treatment methods have evolved.
With regards to epilepsy, scientific research on automatic
seizure detection started about 40 years ago [1]. The neurons
generate electrical signals when they perceive stimuli from
the environment or interact with each other for performing
different activities [2]. The electrical signal generated by a
single neuron is not strong enough to be detected. However,
when a cluster of neurons act in concert, they generate an

electrical signal which is strong enough to be detected and
recorded. This recorded electrical signal, produced by the
neurons, is called electroencephalogram (EEG) [3].
EEG signals are recorded with the help of multiple electrodes placed either on the scalp or inside the skull (intracranial). A standard montage referred to as 10-20 system is
most commonly employed to record the electrical activity
of the brain. EEG has opened a new era in studying and
understanding the structure and functionality of brain and has
assumed its position as an important technique in monitoring and treating different brain disorders such as epilepsy,
short term memory loss, emotion recognition and sleep disorders [4]–[8], etc.
EEG is one of the most important tools for brain diagnostics, but it also has certain limitations. In traditional EEG,
the electrodes that sense the brain activity are connected to
a computer that records the measured signals in its memory. The number of electrodes, also referred to as channels,

vary from 23 to 256 for different recording standards and
applications. Sensing, recording and processing this multichannel signal requires significant power, storage and computational resources, roughly proportional to the number of
channels [9]. For a typical EEG recording session, the subject
must visit the laboratory because the sensing and recording
equipment is fixed and immobile [10]. Besides this, when
the EEG of an individual is recorded using the traditional
method, it is carried out under controlled conditions to suppress interference and anomalies from other sources and the
background activities of the brain. However, this limits the
observation and recording period and the brain disorder may
not manifest during the recording window [11], [12]. The
long-term recording of EEG in a controlled environment
causes discomfort to the subject who must control its movement and must wear the gear/cap on its head with conductive
gel for several hours. Not to mention, it hampers the routine
activities of the subject [12].
To mitigate the limitations of traditional EEG enumerated
above, recent research is directed towards mobile wireless
EEG recording devices, which provide the advantage of
recording in a natural environment for extended duration.
This could allow the device to collect more data and possibly
improve the odds of observation of seizure in a patient. For
example, cEEGrid has 10 electrodes printed on a flexible
sheet that could be easily pasted around the ear. Size of
electrodes vary from 3-5 mm with distance between two
electrodes designed to be 8-10 mm. These flexible electrodes are affixed around each ear. EEG signals are amplified with an amplifier, which is connected through WiFi
or Bluetooth to a recording and/or processing device. The
signals could be recorded in micro-memory cards. There are
typically 20 channels recorded simultaneously, 10 from each
side [12], [13].
There are several products in the market, which employ
wireless transmission of EEG signals in real-time to a computing machine. Neurophone is one such very popular device,
in which a mobile phone interface controlled by EEG signals is also achieved through mobile wireless EEG transmission [14]. In this product, an Emotiv EPOC headset, which
has 16 electrodes is employed. This headset uses 14 channels for recording purposes and two electrodes are taken as
reference. These electrodes are arranged roughly according
to 10-20 scheme so that they cover maximum area on the
scalp. Then the recorded signals are transferred to a mobile
thorough wireless transceiver, and a cell phone is operated on
basis of the signals received from the headset. This Emotiv
EPOC headset also contains gyroscopic sensors that help
in maintaining the orientation of subject’s head. Recently,
another 8-channel low power EEG headset is introduced,
which also transmits the signals through a wireless module.
This 8-channel sensor platform was integrated into a wearable
device which enables easy and fast monitoring of the subject.
Also, these electrodes don’t need any conductive gel because
they are designed in a way that they give performance comparable to traditional electrodes [15].
VOLUME 8, 2020

The EEG signals are amplified during recording, after
which different signal processing techniques from both
time and frequency domain analysis could be used for
extracting the required features, such as wavelet transform [16], empirical mode decomposition [17], [18], and
scattering transform [19]–[23], and dynamic mode decomposition [24], [25], etc. For analysis of these signals,
different machine learning algorithms like support-vector
machine (SVM), principal component analysis (PCA), lineardiscriminant analysis (LDA), neural networks, decision-tree
classifiers, and sometimes a combination of these techniques
are employed [26]–[31].
In this paper, we aim to contribute in the domain of mobile
EEG devices for detection of epileptic seizures. To the best
of our knowledge, no ambulatory wireless device is available
in the market for observation and long term monitoring of
epileptic seizures using EEG signals. The challenge is to
design a device that operates on battery, can support a wireless
transceiver, and has an extended charge cycle, sufficient to
considerably improve the yield of epileptic seizures to a level
that allows reliable observation and monitoring of epileptic discharges in patients. The long-term recording of EEG
signals is a frequent requirement for accurate detection of
epileptic disorders. For example, the neurologists may require
a patient to undergo induced seizures or to stay overnight
in a medical facility for extended EEG recording sessions
so that epileptic activity could be observed in their scalp
EEG signals. Having an EEG device that patients could wear
discretely and that does not impede their everyday activities
might herald a breakthrough in the treatment of epilepsy.
Such a device might be able to stimulate the development
of algorithms and techniques that could reliably assess the
short-term risk of an impending seizure for a patient, and
consequently, inform the patient to take safety precautions.
Our approach is to analyze the performance of an epileptic
seizure detection algorithm in the situation where we employ
a simplified montage with considerably reduced number of
EEG channels focused in the temporal region of the scalp.
We study the effect upon the performance of a simple seizure
detection algorithm when the number of channels is reduced
from 23 channels in 10-20 configuration to 10 channels
largely confined to the temporal region of the scalp. To assess
the performance degradation caused by the use of a smaller
number of channels, we apply the proposed method upon
a well known dataset (know as CHB-MIT [32]). Although,
there is some performance loss, the idea is that by reducing
the number of channels employed for the detection of seizure
activity, we can reduce the computational, storage and transmission complexity/cost of the device, enabling the design of
ambulatory wireless EEG devices capable of long-term EEG
recording. We also recognize some limitations of this study as
the dataset used in this study is not recorded in an ambulatory
scenario.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section II,
we discuss the dataset and the proposed methodology for feature selection, supervised learning, and performance analysis

in detail, followed by performance metrics and results in
Section III. In Section IV, we discuss the limitations of the
approach and future improvements. Conclusions are drawn
in Section V.
II. METHODOLOGY

In this section, we present information about the publicly
available dataset used in this work, and the steps involved in
our algorithm such as feature extraction, classifier training,
and post-processing, etc. A block diagram for the proposed
methodology is given in Fig. 1.
A. DATASET

In this study, the EEG data used is from a publicly available
dataset, referred to as CHB-MIT dataset [32]. This dataset
has been very widely used, e.g., [33] and [34]. This EEG
dataset is recorded from 24 patients at Children Hospital
Boston (CHB). All the recordings are at 256Hz sampling
rate with 16-bit resolution. The dataset consists of scalp
EEG recording, and the number of channels in these records
vary from 23 to 32. For all patients, we have 23 channels,
except for the EEG recording of patient number 15, for
whom 32 channels have been used. In recording of data,
international 10-20 system of electrode placement was followed [5]. The total duration of the recorded data is 982 hours
that are unevenly distributed over the patients. In total, we
have 664 files out of which 129 files contain one or more
epileptic seizures; the number of observed seizures also vary
from patient to patient [33]. In our study, we have selected
60% data for training (supervised learning), which contains
both seizure and non-seizure data and 40% data has been
employed for testing and validation, which also contains
both seizure and non-seizure representations. The choice of
data for training and testing is based upon random sampling
technique [35]–[37].
B. FEATURE EXTRACTION

This is one of the most important tasks before classification,
because if the features are not chosen carefully, they will not
capture enough information needed for the classifier to be
able to distinguish between the signals representing different classes or labels. The performance of the classifier may
65882

be entirely unsatisfactory if either the features are too few
to form the basis for discrimination (under-fitting), or they
are too numerous to let the classifier learn their generalized
characteristics on unseen data (over-fitting). Thus, it is very
important to analyze the data first and then adopt the features suitable for the problem under study. This process is
also referred to as feature engineering. As already discussed
in the previous section, several features like coefficients of
wavelet decomposition, frequency domain features, fuzzy
entropy, etc. have been used in previous studies with varying amount of success. In our research, we employ time
domain features as they are simple to measure and contain
sufficient information for a reasonable performance of an
automatic seizure detection system. As the EEG signal is not
stationary, it is a common practice to segment the EEG signal
into smaller epochs, and during these epochs, the signal is
assumed to exhibit characteristics of a stationary signal. For
the CHB-MIT dataset at hand, and for a sampling frequency
of 256Hz, we divide the signal into segments (epochs) of one
second duration – each one second epoch has 256 samples.
After extracting the features for each epoch individually, the
extracted features could be organized in the form of a matrix
as shown in Fig. 2 [4].
Through this process of feature collection, as shown in
Fig. 2, we compute the local statistical features of the data
in each epoch, referred to as the time domain features. This
is because we are computing these statistics directly from
VOLUME 8, 2020

R. Asif et al.: Epileptic Seizure Detection With a Reduced Montage: Way Forward for Ambulatory EEG Devices

the time-domain signals representing EEG channels without transforming the signals to the frequency domain. For
this study, we are using a total of 8 time domain features,
which are Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation, Kurtosis, Quartile, Range, and Skewness.
C. CHANNEL SELECTION

There have been several recent advances in the area of
EEG signal processing. Various techniques, algorithms and
heuristics are used to process EEG waveform for monitoring and treatment of myriad of disorders related to brain.
Among these methods, channel selection is an important technique for detection of different disorders and miscellaneous
applications, such as seizure analysis, emotion classification,
mental-task classification, sleep stage classification [37], etc.
In this section, we focus on channel selection for seizure
detection, which is usually based upon different criteria,
such as filtering techniques, wrapper techniques, embedded
techniques, hybrid techniques, human-based techniques [38],
[39]. These traditional techniques do not focus on channels in
a specific region, i.e., selected channels could be from different regions of the scalp. In contrast to these techniques for
channel selection, in this paper, our focus will be on reducing
the number of channels such that the residual channels are
confined to a specific region of the scalp for seizure detection.
The rationale for this choice is two-folds. Firstly, to assess the
performance degradation of the seizure detection algorithm
for a device with compact design using fewer electrodes
concentrated in a region of the scalp. The secondary reason,
for this choice of selecting a region for seizure detection,
is inspired from the biological studies that associate seizure
related activities mostly with the temporal region of the brain.
This perspective, i.e., temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is discussed below in detail.
From anatomical and functional perspective, the human
brain is divided into different regions, i.e., frontal region,
temporal region, central region and posterior region. Brain
studies suggest that specific regions of the brain are primarily responsible for their specific respective functions.
For instance, the frontal part of the brain is concerned with
intelligence and memory, and the posterior part of the brain is
linked with visual functionalities, etc., [40]. Similarly, different areas of the brain, or when a bunch of neurons behave in an
abnormal way, they give rise to different brain disorders. If the
condition persists for a longer time, then that area becomes
the focal point for certain disorders. For majority of epileptic
patients, temporal region is the primary suspect as the source
of the epileptic discharges. In adults, the majority of patients
have temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) [41]–[43].
Following the concept of TLE and the temporal region
to be the main contributor in epilepsy, we successively
remove those EEG waveforms from the dataset that have been
recorded from channels away from temporal region. Hence
from the given set of channels spread over the scalp, we select
channels mostly local to the temporal region as shown in
Fig. 3. In Fig. 3, we have marked the channels according

corresponding identifiers used in the CHB-MIT dataset.

subset of EEG channels.

to the information provided by CHB-MIT dataset. We have
the same configuration of channels for the first 10 patients,
Patient 23 and Patient 24. Similarly, the patients numbered
from 11 to 22 have the same configuration. The only patient
with 32 channels is Patient 15, which has an irregular naming
pattern for the electrodes and the corresponding channels.
The sequence of channels with respect to nodes is given in
Table 1.
For selection of temporal channels, we have considered 4
different scenarios, which progressively reduce the number of
channels and restrict them to the temporal region of the brain.
These scenarios are shown in Table 2.
65883

R. Asif et al.: Epileptic Seizure Detection With a Reduced Montage: Way Forward for Ambulatory EEG Devices

For first scenario we select 12 channels, i.e., 6 channels
from each side of the scalp, but we have an exception for
Patient 15. For patient 15, we have 32 channels in the dataset
but in case of reduced montage we have taken 2 extra channels from each side that is in total we have 16 channels
for Patient 15. In case of scenario number 2, we have 10
channels, 5 from each side. Similarly, in third scenario, we
have a total of 8 channels, four from each side. To reduce the
number of channels from 5 to 4 on each side, we omit channel
number 7 and 15, and retain channel number 6 and 14. In last
scenario, we simplify the montage further, and now we have
only 6 channels, 3 from each side of the brain in a symmetric
configuration.

shown in the blue color are over-represented. (b) The number of samples
of minority and majority classes are balanced by RUSBoost by reducing
the representation of majority class through undersampling.

D. CLASSIFIER

The design of a classifier for seizure detection from EEG
data is comparatively challenging, partly because the data is
highly imbalanced, i.e., the number of epochs representing
the seizure (epileptiform activity) class and the epochs representing the non-seizure (normal) class are very unevenly
represented in both the training and testing parts of the
dataset. The seizure class is very rare, while almost all the data
is representative of the non-seizure class. The learning rate
of the classifier for the seizure class becomes considerably
slower, as most of the data it observes belongs to the nonseizure class. This situation is a typical example of a classification problem involving imbalanced or skewed data. As
an example, let us assume that we have 50,000 epochs in the
overall dataset. Out of the total 50,000, let’s say 48,000, i.e.,
96%, belong to the non-seizure class, i.e., normal activity, and
the remaining 2000, i.e., 4%, to the seizure class. If we train
a traditional classifier on this composition of data, there is
overwhelming likelihood that our classifier may not deliver
satisfactory performance due to inadequate training of the
marginalized class [34].
To overcome this issue of class imbalance, there are two
main approaches considered in literature: under-sampling
and over-sampling. Random under-sampling (RUS) technique represents the former category, where the samples from
majority class are removed and are balanced with the minority
class. While for up sampling, we have synthetic minority
over-sampling technique (SMOTE) in which extra samples
are intelligently augmented to the minority class for balancing data representation [44]. In case of down-sampling, i.e.,
RUS technique, we have advantage of reduced computational
cost because it speeds up the classifier training stage due to
smaller number of samples as compared to SMOTE.
RUSBoost is a combination of random under-sampling
and boosting techniques. In RUSBoost, we under-sample the
majority class and use the boosting technique, in a similar
way as AdaBoost uses it as a primary component. There is a
slight difference in RUSBoost and AdaBoost. In RUSBoost,
random under-sampling results in a new distribution, which
is used to determine weights for the weak classifiers. In
case of AdaBoost too, we have under-sampling, and datasets
are created but these datasets are temporary, so classifiers
65884

use these temporary datasets thus improving the performance [34].
In Fig. 4, we have two scatter plots. In Plot (a), we have
original data representing the non-seizure class, which is
about 99% of total data set, and seizure class is about 1%
of total data. But in Plot (b), after the implementation of
RUSBoost, this 99% is reduced to almost 50% and both
classes are almost balanced.
E. POST PROCESSING

EEG signals cannot be recorded completely noise-free,
although, these signals are mostly recorded under controlled
conditions and in specially designed facilities to minimize
noise effects and miscellaneous artifacts. Even in these controlled conditions, the recorded EEG signal is always coupled
with noise, which may be thermal noise introduced from
the measurement and amplification process, or noise due to
proximity to other electrical appliances or artifacts arising due
the movement of the subject or their eye movement, etc. Thus,
it is not advisable to use these signals directly for training
of classifier and still expect satisfactory results. In order to
obtain good results, pre-processing and post-processing steps
are almost always performed.
A typical pre-processing step is to perform low pass filtering before sampling the signal. This rejects the out-of-band
noise and artifacts, and serves to ameliorate the effects of
aliasing. We assume that the pre-processing step has been performed at the time of acquisition and sampling of the signal.
However, we use two post-processing techniques at the output
of the classifier to improve upon the performance of the
raw labels detected by the classifier. These post-processing
steps are very typical for the automatic seizure detection
algorithms [45], [46]. The parameters of the post-processing
filters are chosen based upon the statistical properties and
physiological conventions pertaining to the manifestation of
epileptiform activity in EEG waveforms.
1) The sequence of suggested labels obtained from the
classifier is taken as an input to a run-length smoothing
filter. This filter is designed to detect the seizure if its
input consists of positive detections of seizure class
VOLUME 8, 2020

R. Asif et al.: Epileptic Seizure Detection With a Reduced Montage: Way Forward for Ambulatory EEG Devices

for N consecutive epochs, where N is typically chosen
to have a value in the range of few epochs, i.e., 4
to 15 epochs [45]. The justification for this range of
values is that a seizure is marked as observed by the
neurologists only if it persists for at least this duration.
Otherwise, short bursts of activity are dismissed as
electrode-induced noise or an artifact, and not marked
as seizures by the trained physicians. The choice of
N as a parameter of this run-length-smoothing filter
provides a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity
(or equivalently between Type-I and Type-II errors),
and provides an effective degree of freedom to choose
an appropriate point on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
2) The detected seizures in the output of the run-lengthsmoothing filter are represented by bursts of minimum
length of N epochs (or seconds). However, if two such
occurrences are very close to each other, they should
really be consolidated as a single seizure activity. Such
closely spaced positive detections are grouped together
as a single seizure if they are separated by less than a
minute, i.e., 60 epochs. This helps avoid over representation of positive detected events or seizures [46].
III. RESULTS

Before discussing the results, we define some basic terminology that will be used frequently in the analysis of results later
in this section.
True positive (TP) is the counter that increments when
the algorithm chooses a positive outcome and it coincides
with the positive detection in the ground truth. We assume
a TP event has occurred, if the positive labels epochs are
detected for N consecutive epochs in a time window beginning from 1 minute prior to the start of the seizure and ending
at 1 minute after the end of seizure. Note that this window,
also referred to as seizure horizon, is defined with reference
to the boundaries of positive event marked in the ground
truth. The choice of this extended inclusion interval is in
consonance with the accepted tradition in the EEG epileptic
event detection literature [45], [46].
False positive (FP) is reported when the algorithm detects
a positive value although we have zero label, i.e., non-seizure
activtiy, marked in the ground truth. However, if we have FP
detection within 3 minutes of a TP detection, it is not counted
as a FP, as it may be observed owing to pre-ictal and/or postictal epileptic discharges on the horizon of a seizure. Note that
this ambiguous interval, arising due to seizure horizon and its
accompanying epileptic transients, is considered both before
and after the TP event.
True negative (TN) is the true detection performed by our
algorithm in non-seizure region.
False negative (FN) is an event where we have an epileptic
seizure marked in the ground truth and our algorithm fails to
detect that seizure as a positive detection.
From the aforementioned terminology, we derive further
nomenclature that is used in the evaluation of results.

A. EVALUATION OF THE PERFORMANCE OF
RUN-LENGTH-SMOOTHING FILTER FOR VARYING
AMOUNTS OF FILTER MEMORY

As mentioned in the previous section, we have used runlength-smoothing filter in post-processing with N determining the amount of memory of the filter. We have used four
values of N = 4 sec, N = 7 sec, N = 8 sec and N = 10 sec,
and calculated TPR and FP/hr as shown in Fig. 5.
From Fig. 5, we can see that there is an inverse relation
between TPR and FP/hr. At N = 4 sec, we have TPR = 0.95
and FP/hr = 1.12 . Similarly, for N = 10 sec, the algorithm
achieves FP/hr = 0.06, but the TRP drops by almost 10% to
0.85. We conclude that N = 7 sec provides a good trade-off
as the parameter of the run-length-smoothing filter since it
gives us very good TRP, i.e., 0.95, and FP/hr = 0.16, both of
which are important to be within a reasonable range.
B. RESULTS FOR FULL MONTAGE (All 23 CHANNELS)

In this section, we discuss the performance of the proposed
approach when features extracted from all the channels in

C. RESULTS FOR RESTRICTED MONTAGE

the EEG recording are utilized for both training and testing
of the classifier. There is a total of 24 subjects in the CHBMIT dataset and we apply our algorithm on all the records
except Patient 12. The reason for excluding Patient 12 from
analysis is because of the poor quality of the recorded signal.
Among the remaining 23 subjects in the CHB-MIT dataset,
the recordings corresponding to 22 of these subjects have
a total of 23 channels each. However, there is one patient,
i.e., Patient 15, for whom the channels are non-differential
and the number of channels is 32. The results reported in
Table 3 are for the patient specific classifiers, with run-lengthsmoothing filter of N = 7 sec, and have been obtained using
same classifier structure for all the patients, i.e., RUSboost
classifier followed by post-processing steps as explained in
Section II-E.
From Table 3, we can see that using all the available channel data in the recordings, we obtain a TPR = 0.95, specificity
= 0.99, and a very low FP/hr, i.e., 0.16, with an average delay
of 6.88 sec. Accuracy calculated for these results is 0.9971.
These are the results for 23 patients because we have
already excluded Patient 12 due to inconsistency in channels while recording data. We observe that the results could
improve further if we exclude Patient 16 from analysis. The
reason for this improvement is because of relatively atypical
length of seizure observed in the records of Patient 16. Many
of the seizures for Patient 16 are about 5-10 second in duration. A smaller value of N helps in improving sensitivity for
Patient 16 at the cost of sharp rise in FP/hr for other subjects.
By excluding the results of Patient 16 from the analysis, the
TPR approaches to 0.98, TNR approaches to 0.998 and FP/hr
declines to 0.075 with an average delay of 7.19 sec.
65886

Proceeding one step ahead with the same settings of experiment as for 23 channels, i.e., N = 7 sec filter, RUSboost
classifier, and patient specific method, we reduce the number of channels successively, and calculate the performance
results, analyzing which channel/region is the most critical
for seizure detection.
In order to perform this analysis, we repeated our
experiment under 4 different scenarios, as mentioned in
Section II-C in detail, i.e., 12 channels, 10 channels, 8 channels and 6 channels.
From Fig. 6, we can see that the dotted line, representing
TPR, is increasing slightly with increasing number of channels in previous subsection, but as the number of channels
are 10 or 12, it has negligible variation, i.e., TPR ≈ 0.92.
However, as we further decreased number of channels to 8,
TPR decreased to 0.90 and FP/hr increased to 0.366. Further
decreasing the number of channels to 6, TPR decreased to
0.84 and FP/hr increased to 0.91. Thus, it can be said that TPR
is directly proportional to number of channels. But for FP/hr,
represented with a solid line, the number of false alarms
decrease with increase in number of channels. However, for
10 channels and 12 channels, there is negligible difference in
FP/hr, i.e., from 0.20 to 0.21.
Evaluating the results for all four scenarios in which we
have different number of channels ranging from 4 − 12, we
can conclude that second scenario, i.e., 10 temporal channels,
provides us a good trade-off with sensitivity of 0.9236, specificity value of 0.997, false positive rate per hour of 0.21, an
accuracy of 99.62%, and average delay of 7.1 sec. Detailed
results for each patient for 10 channels are shown in Table 4. If
we exclude patient number 16, as we did in all channel results
before, then our TPR will become 0.932, TNR increases
to 0.997, FP/hr decreases to 0.13 with an average delay of
7.07 seconds.
D. ALL CHANNELS VS. TEMPORAL
CHANNELS COMPARISON

From Tables 3 and 4, we can draw a comparison between the
results obtained for both the temporal channels case and all
channels case. In Fig. 6, we are comparing the FP/hr for all
channels and the temporal channels for 23 patients.

TABLE 5. Comparison of average values of TPR, TNR, FP/hr and delay for
all channels and temporal channels for 23 patients and 22 patients,
respectively.

This might happen because in case of these two patients, the
seizure might be focused in the temporal region and other
channels may have unrelated background activity. Thus, we
might get better detection only with temporal channels for
these patients.
Table 5 summarizes the discussion by comparing the
results of TPR, TNR, FP/hr and delay for all channels and
the temporal channels, respectively. From the table we can see
that TPR for all channels is 0.95, while in case of the temporal
channels, it decreases to 0.92, which could be tolerated if
the priority is to decrease the number of electrodes used for
acquisition to enable a compact system design and longer
battery life of the device.
In Table 5, TNR for both cases is almost the same, i.e.,
0.99, and FP/hr for all channels is 0.16, while for the temporal
channels, it leads by 0.05. In case of delay, the temporal
channels lead by 0.13 seconds from all channels.
E. COMPARISON OF RESULTS BETWEEN 23 PATIENTS
AND 22 PATIENTS
FIGURE 7. Comparison of FP/hr of all channels vs. temporal channels
patient wise and in last we have average results of FP/hr.

FIGURE 8. Comparison of TPR of all channels vs. temporal channels
patient wise and in last average value of TPR is plotted.

In Fig. 7, we can see that for 12 patients we have same
number of FP/hr for all channels and the temporal channels,
for 6 patients we have slightly higher FP/hr rate as compared
to all channels, but overall there is not that much difference
between all channels and temporal channels.
In Fig. 8, we can see patient wise comparison of TPR for
all channels and temporal channels. From Fig. 8, we can
clearly see that we have almost same value of TPR for 17
patients out of 23, 4 patients gave better value of TPR with
all channels as compared to temporal channels, while on other
hand, we have two patients, i.e., patient number 13 and 17,
which showed better TPR value with only temporal channels.
VOLUME 8, 2020

As discussed above, in CHB-MIT data set, we have a total
24 patients and we excluded Patient 12 for inconsistent file
sequence and calculated results for 23 patients only. Out of
these 23 patients, for Patient 16, our algorithm shows some
odd results as compared to other patients due to reason that
this patient has seizure length in between 5-10 sec. With
a filter size of 7 sec, most of the seizure events remain
undetected by our algorithm. However, if we exclude Patient
16, and calculate our results for remaining 22 patients, we
observe some increase in TPR and decrease in TP/hr as shown
in Table 5.
From Table 5, we can clearly see that as the performance
results for all channels averaged over the 22 patients (instead
of 23 patients) are considered, the TPR increases from 0.95 to
0.98, FP/hr decreases from 0.16 to 0.07, and in a similar way,
accuracy increased from 99.7% to 99.87%. Also, for temporal
channels for 22 patients, TPR increased from 0.92 to 0.93,
FP/hr decreased from 0.21 to 0.13 and accuracy increased
from 99.61% to 99.75%.
F. COMPARISON OF RESULTS
WITH EXISTING TECHNIQUES:

Although, the standard 10/20 system is used for electrode
placement in recording of EEG for most of the clinical studies
and neurological lab recordings, several methods have been
65887

TABLE 6. Performance comparison of seizure detection techniques.

proposed in the literature to reduce the number of electrodes
in order to minimize computational cost and hardware complexity. To reduce the number of EEG electrodes, Tekgul
et al. [50] proposed an algorithm for automatic seizure detection in neonates, and compared the results of full and reduced
montage [50] obtained from a dataset having 151 recordings
obtained from 139 infants. In this work, nine channels were
considered in the reduced montage configuration. Among
these nine channels, eight channels were chosen from the
temporal and frontal regions, while a single additional channel was selected from the central region. With full montage,
the algorithm could detect 187 seizures from 31 recordings
obtained from 30 patients. On the other hand, with reduced
montage, i.e., with 9 channels, 166 seizures were detected
from 29 patients. Using the reduced montage, the sensitivity and specificity of 96.8% and 100%, respectively, were
obtained with respect to full montage.
Chang et al. also proposed channel selection algorithm
for epilepsy detection [51] and presented results using the
CHB-MIT data set. Out of the 24 patients in CHB-MIT
dataset, only 6 patients were selected, i.e., 1, 3, 6, 7, 10
and 22. The evaluation of their result is based on two main
criteria. Firstly, the false positive rate of the patient must be
less than 0.2 per hour. Secondly, at least one alarm generated
in the pre-ictal period would be regarded as a successful
detection. Success rate is considered to be equal to the number
of true detections divided by total number of seizures used
for testing. If a patient satisfies both the above conditions,
it will be counted as a patient upon which the algorithm
completed successfully. With 22 channels, the number of
successful patients were 5 out of 6 patients. For reduced
number of channels, 75 different montages involving 3, 4,
5 or 6 channels were successively adopted, and the success
rate for the best combination of channels (maximum up to 6
channels) reached to 85%.
Some recent works [47]–[49] also considered the topic of
channel selection and presented the performance results using
CHB-MIT dataset. A summary of the performance comparison of these methods with the proposed method is given in
Table 6. It should be noted that in the prior work on the topic
of EEG channel selection, including [47]–[51], the method
of reduction in the number of channels is proposed so that
either the best detection accuracy is obtained or sensitivity is
maximized for a fixed false positive rate subject to the constraint on a fixed number of maximum channels. In contrast
to these earlier works, this paper considers the reduction of
channels focused on a specific region of the scalp (temporal
region) so that the feasibility of an ambulatory wireless EEG
65888

device with prolonged battery life could be evaluated for
long-term recording and detection of epileptic seizures. We
have presented results for both, the full montage, i.e., with
all 23 available channels, and the reduced montage, i.e., with
10 (or less) channels in/around the temporal region of the
scalp. By using our algorithm, we obtain sensitivity values
of 0.95 and 0.92, specificity values of 0.99 and 0.99 and false
positive per hour values as 0.16 and 0.21, for all channels and
10 temporal channels, respectively. If we consider the results
for only 6 selected patients (as in [51]), i.e., 1, 3, 6, 7, 10
and 22, we obtain 100% sensitivity and 0.02 false positive
alarms per hour for all channels. In case of reduced montage
(10 temporal channels), we have 100% sensitivity and 0.035
false positive alarms per hour. On comparing these results
with those reported in [51], in case of reduced montage of
10 channels, our algorithm detects all the seizures in these
6 patients correctly where each patient has FP/hr < 0.2.
Also, our proposed method shows comparable (or better)
performance relative to the performance of methods such
as [47]–[49] when the number of channels and the selected
patients are almost the same. Most importantly, there is no
significant loss in performance caused by spatial restriction
and reduction in number of electrodes. A slight reduction in
performance might be tolerable if the priority is to design
a lightweight, wearable and wireless EEG acquisition and
recording device for automatic detection of epileptic seizures.
IV. LIMITATIONS

There are some limitations of this study, which are identified
next and could be considered in a future research effort.
The first limitation of this work is that the performance
comparison drawn between the scenarios of full and reduced
montage is only based upon the CHB-MIT dataset. CHB-MIT
dataset is the most widely used EEG dataset for epileptic
signal analysis, and it is considered a de-facto standard for
epileptic seizure detection studies. The dataset is very large
and includes sufficient number of patients to be considered a
reasonable representative of the variety of seizures observed
in pediatric patients. However, the seizures have not been
individually labelled for their types or focal regions and one
might argue whether it is sufficient to assess the proposed
detection technique only upon this dataset and how accurately
its performance might generalize over other patients who
might experience different types of seizures. This uncertainty
could be resolved by extending the study to other recorded
datasets with diverse set of patients with respect to age, sex,
and medical history, etc. Another obvious limitation of the
study is that the CHB-MIT dataset, used in this study, is
VOLUME 8, 2020

R. Asif et al.: Epileptic Seizure Detection With a Reduced Montage: Way Forward for Ambulatory EEG Devices

not EEG seizure data recorded in an ambulatory situation.
The detection of seizure might be much more challenging in
wireless ambulatory situation due to the additional artifacts
produced by the movement of limbs, and it merits detailed
performance analysis to be able to draw any conclusions.
One possible approach in the ambulatory scenario might be
to employ a sophisticated artifact removal algorithm prior to
detection of seizure.
V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have considered the reduction of EEG
channels for seizure detection by comparing the performance
results of sensitivity, specificity, and FP/hr obtained using all
the channels in the EEG recording, i.e., 23 channels, versus
the results obtained using only 10 channels in the temporal
region. After analyzing the results, we see that there is some
performance loss observed when applying reduction in number and restriction in space on EEG channel measurements,
but this loss of relative performance could be justifiable if
we compare it with computational cost, hardware complexity
and energy consumption for larger number of channels spread
over the scalp. The results establish a successful feasibility for
the design of an efficient ambulatory EEG device that features
fewer channels, less computation, reduced hardware cost, and
low energy consumption as compared to a device utilizing all
channels in a standard 10-20 system.
