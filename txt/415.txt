ABSTRACT
Healthy brain is important in making sure that our lives are run properly. In
most cases, normal and emotionally stable persons can think wisely and most
of the time they are able to execute proper strategy in any problem solving.
Listening to the Binaural Beats tone is one of the methods to distress. The
effects of the Binaural Beats tone on male and female were observed on
Alpha and Beta sub bands in both hemispheres. 40 subjects were involved
in EEG data collection of sessions before and after listening to the binaural
beats. The frequency of the beats used in this research is Alpha frequency
of 9 Hz. The Energy Spectral Density feature (ESD) for both left and right
hemispheres were used. Graphical analysis observing the box plot from the
Normality Test shows that in session before, females have higher alpha level
in both hemispheres as compared to males. Females have lower beta level
in both hemispheres as compared to males. In session after listening to the
binaural beats, both males and females have better decrement in beta levels
in both hemispheres. Decrement in Beta sub bands also indicates that the
subjects are getting more relaxed. The results indicate that male’s brain is
easier to be entrained. During listening to noise, female group shows that
they are easily affected by noise as compared to males.
Keywords: Binaural Beats, EEG, ESD, female and male.

Introduction
Humans differ from each other not only on how we handle pressure or
stress, but every one of us is also different with regards to our susceptibility
or trigger to stress. Some of us can easily be affected by distractions, e.g.
a person can get stress only by hearing little noises around him/her. There
are also people who are calmer and less susceptible to stress.
In this context, this paper focuses on studying the differences between
men and women when they are in closed eye relaxed condition, induced with
stress and entrained with audio alpha frequency. When a person experiences
stress, some changes occur to their brainwaves that can be measured from
his /her EEG signals. This provides a platform where EEG reading will be
taken and analyzed, particularly to identify and distinguish the brainwave
patterns between men and women in different circumstances related to stress.
Usually, normal and emotionally stable person can think wisely and
they are able to execute proper strategy in problem solving. However, due
to stressful life events, some of us are not able to lead a healthy and positive
life due to stress. There are many ways to distress ourselves and one of the
ways is by listening to binaural beat. Binaural Beats is one of the technique
under brainwave entrainment (Huang & Charyton, 2008; Yamsa-ard &
Wongsawat, 2014).
The main objective of this research is to study and identify the different
patterns of frontal alpha and beta EEG waves of men and women in three
different states i) pre-stress state, ii) state of induced stress and iii) state of
stress-alleviation. For the stress alleviation state, we employ binaural-beats
brainwave entrainment as a method to alleviate stress, which is an alternative
to meditation (Yamsa-ard & Wongsawat, 2014).
From this work, we expect to understand more on the patterns of
frontal alpha and beta waves of men and women and their relations to stress.
And from the analysis of data, we expect to learn and may conclude on the
following questions:
►

Between males and females, who are easily distracted and more
susceptible to stress?

►

Between men and women, who can be easily alleviated from stress?

The Effect of Listening to Binaural Beats on Frontal EEG Alpha and Beta of Males and Females

We have an initial assumption that both of these groups should have
different EEG patterns due to their different gender and thus different mental
conditions. Two EEG bands which are fast brainwaves will be observed
during the experiment for analysis that are Alpha and Beta sub bands.
These two EEG sub bands are focused upon since they are seen as ones that
actively react to emotional activities, e.g. stress and depression (Tabacaru,
2013; Knott et. al., 2001; Tortella-Feliu et. al., 2014). EEG readings will be
read only from the frontal brain, which is normally associated with human
emotions ((Tabacaru, 2013; Tortella-Feliu et. al., 2014; Thibodeau et. al.,
2006; Davidson & Fox, 1982).

Methodology
Based on the objective of this study, an experimental procedure was designed
for EEG data collection from both men and women subjects. EEG data
collected from this experiment will be processed and analyzed especially to
study and identify the different EEG patterns of men and women when they
are in three different states related to stress as defined earlier. Besides, the
EEG readings between men and women will also be compared to identify
the differences between genders.

SUBJECTS AND DATA ACQUISITION
There were 40 subjects voluntarily involved in this study comprising 18
males and 22 females. All of them are right handed and have no history of
mental illnesses. A day before the experiment was conducted the subjects
were reminded not to consume any product which contains caffeine. This is
due to the fact that caffeine has the ability to increase the level of alertness
and to inhibit exhaustion (Smith, 2002). They were also free from any
medications. All the subjects were requested to sign consent forms and
completed the DASS (Depress, Anxiety and Stress) questionnaire prior to
the experiment. The subjects were allowed to leave the experiment if they
ever felt uncomfortable. The experiment which included the EEG recording
was conducted in a dimly lit and air-conditioned room. The subjects sat
80

on comfortable chairs. They put on a sleeping mask to reduce distress on
their eyes while being closed for quite sometime. An isolated earphone was
used to listen to the noise and binaural beat tones. This type of earphone
was used because it could obstruct the noise from the surrounding and also
promote a good quality of sound of binaural beat tones.
The EEG recording was done using EMOTIV EPOC which has 14
channels connected to a laptop. The 14 electrodes are AF3, AF4, F3, F4,
F7, F8, FC5, FC6, P3 (CMS), P4 (DRL), P7, P8, T7, T8, O1 and O2.
P3 and P4 are the references. The location of the electrodes followed
the International 10/20 System of Electrode Placement. However, in this
experiment, only eight frontal electrodes were taken into analysis which
are AF3, AF4, F3, F4, F7, F8, FC5 and FC6. The sampling frequency of
this equipment is 128 Hz.
Figure 1 shows the EMOTIV EPOC, isolated earphone and the location
of the electrodes.

PROCEDURE
Figure 2 shows the summary of the flow of the process during the experiment.
The three sessions where EEG signal was recorded were; i) Doing Nothing
Session, ii) Listening to Noise Session and iii) After Binaural Beat Session.
In this experiment, we used noise as the stress stimulator. The sound of
noise being used in the experiment is the traffic noise which is produced
from the laptop with the volume being standardized. It is an annoying sound
that would normally induce stress in many people (Wagner et. al., 2010).
After listening to the noise, the subject is given time to listen to
binaural beats audio for 20 minutes. The binaural beats tone is produced
using Brainwave Generator software which is installed in the lap top. We
estimated that by listening to binaural beats tone, the subject’s EEG will
respond positively. The EEG reading is taken only after the subject has
finished listening to binaural beats. We conjectured that the effect of such
audio entrainment will last not only during the entrainment session but also
after the entrainment session.

Signals Pre-processing

Figure 3: The steps taken in the EEG signals pre-processing

Figure 3 shows the EEG data pre-processing method. The recorded
EEG raw signal will undergo these processes before it can be analyzed.
The pure EEG signals are always contaminated by artifacts such as ocular
artifact (Croft & Barry, 2000) and muscular movement artifacts (Achanccary
& Meggiolaro, 2008). These artifacts if not removed, will corrupt the EEG
data and thus it will cause difficulty in extracting useful information from
the data which later on could lead to misleading results (Ferlazzo et. al.,
2014). Then, the signal is segregated into four sub bands by applying
Hamming band pass filter.

Figure 4: The four sub bands of brainwaves

Figure 4 shows the four sub bands with their range of frequencies.
Delta sub band is observed to have the highest amplitude while Beta sub
band has the lowest amplitude. Next, feature extraction takes place by

82

The Effect of Listening to Binaural Beats on Frontal EEG Alpha and Beta of Males and Females

applying Fast Fourier Transform, FFT to the filtered signal. This process is
done to extract the ESD feature on which later to be analyzed. The signal
pre- processing is done using MATLAB 2010A. The ESD features from
eight frontal electrodes, namely AF3, F3, F7 and FC5 correspond to the left
hemisphere and AF4, F4, F8 and FC6 correspond to the right hemisphere.
Alpha Beta Frontal Energy Ratio, ABFER
The average values of four frontal electrodes on the left hemisphere
and four frontal electrodes on the right hemisphere are obtained according
to their sub bands. Equation 1 and 2 below shows the formula used to attain
the Alpha Beta Frontal Energy Ratio, ABFER (Bos, 2006).

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
In order to interpret the data correctly, we need statistical analysis. In this
experiment, the statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS statistical
version 20.0 for windows. The observation of the data was done based on
the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. This test is applied since the number of
data is less than 50 (N<50). The Shapiro-Wilk normality test is utilized in
this study due to its proficiency outperforming Anderson-Darling test, Lillie
test and Kolmogorov Smirnov test (Razali & Wah, 2011).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This section presents the results obtained from the experiments collected
from the three sessions on 40 samples which comprised 18 males and 22
females. Results are segregated into two parts which are male and female.
Male
There are 18 male subjects involved. The results of Shapiro-Wilk
Normality Test in Table 1 are referred. It can be observed that for male
gender, there are only two features have significant values above 0.05 that is
0.139 for both Alpha Left and Beta Left in session Doing nothing. The rest
of the features in three sessions obtain significant values lower than 0.05.
The low significant values obtained are also resulted from the existence of
the two outliers as observed in the boxplot in Figure 5 and Figure 7. The
outliers appear during session listen to noise.

during listening to the noise session, female subjects show that they are
notably affected by the noise. This can be perceived from the significant
decrement of both alpha left and right sub band median level during the
said session. Alpha sub band is associated with calmness. The decrement
of the alpha sub band shows that the level of calmness of female subjects
has been reduced due to the noise induced. However, the level of the
alpha sub band increased after the subjects were introduced to the binaural
beat tones for 20 minutes. This also shows that the subjects become more
relaxed. Comparing with male subjects, the median level of alpha sub band
for female subjects does not go beyond the median level of alpha sub band
during doing nothing session.

In our work, the Alpha Beta Frontal Energy Ratio feature is capable to
demonstrate the effect of binaural beat tones on alpha and beta sub bands of
different profiles namely male and female. Using graphic statistical analysis,
the box plot, it can be observed that in both hemisphere, alpha and beta sub
band behaved as hypothesized where the alpha sub band decreased during
stress induction and increased after entrained with binaural beat tones. In
contrast, beta sub band increased after stress was induced and decreased
after entrained with binaural beats tone.

Other than that, the brainwave of males is easier to be entrained as
compared to females or in other words, males are easier to be alleviated
from stress meanwhile for females it shows that they are more susceptible to
stress. In other words, it is shown that binaural beats has the ability to help
in reducing our stress. Future work will include classification of different
profiles for different session.
