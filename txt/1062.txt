Background: Measuring engagement and other reactions of patients and health professionals to e-health and e-learning
interventions remains a challenge for researchers.
Objective: The aim of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of using a wireless electroencephalography
(EEG) device to measure affective (anxiety, enjoyment, relaxation) and cognitive (attention, engagement, interest) reactions of
patients and healthcare professionals during e-health or e-learning interventions.
Methods: Using a wireless EEG device, we measured patient (n = 6) and health professional (n = 7) reactions during a
10-minute session of an e-health or e-learning intervention. The following feasibility and acceptability indicators were
assessed and compared for patients and healthcare professionals: number of eligible participants who consented to
participate, reasons for refusal, time to install and calibrate the wireless EEG device, number of participants who completed the
full 10-minute sessions, participant comfort when wearing the device, signal quality, and number of observations obtained for
each reaction. The wireless EEG readings were compared to participant self-rating of their reactions.
Results: We obtained at least 75% of possible observations for attention, engagement, enjoyment, and interest. EEG scores
were similar to self-reported scores, but they varied throughout the sessions, which gave information on participants‚Äô real-time
reactions to the e-health/e-learning interventions. Results on the other indicators support the feasibility and acceptability of
the wireless EEG device for both patients and professionals.
Discussion: Using the wireless EEG device was feasible and acceptable. Future studies must examine its use in other contexts of care
and explore which components of the interventions affected participant reactions by combining wireless EEG and eye tracking.

these risk factors, patients must initiate changes in their behaviors, and healthcare professionals must support those
changes (Garvey, Arathuzik, Miller, & Ard, 2016; The Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration, 2015). Over the last decade,
an increasing number of Web-based e-health and e-learning
interventions have been developed and tested for these
purposes (Cook et al., 2008). For patients, e-health interventions provide a learning environment that can support
behavior change (Wantland, Portillo, Holzemer, Slaughter,
& McGhee, 2004). For healthcare professionals, e-learning
can facilitate the acquisition of the knowledge and skills required to support patients in health behavior change (Cook
et al., 2008).
However, recent studies have shown that the effectiveness of e-health and e-learning interventions is limited by
dropout rates of 50%‚Äì80% (Cugelman, Thelwall, & Dawes,
2011; Krebs, Prochaska, & Rossi, 2010; Norman et al., 2007).
A possible explanation for these numbers resides in the lack
of user engagement, which is essential to sustain user participation and to achieve positive outcomes (Perski, Blandford,

Evaluating E-Interventions Using Wireless EEG

West, & Michie, 2017). Engagement can be divided into a
behavioral and a psychological component (Clark & Mayer,
2016). Behavioral engagement is reflected in overt actions
of users during the interventions‚Äîclicking, writing, or ticking boxes, for instances. Psychological engagement, on
the other hand, is reflected in the mental activity of users
toward the learning goals, making it a more difficult construct
to measure. Both forms of engagement are closely linked
with other affective and cognitive reactions involved in
learning, including attention, interest, enjoyment, relaxation,
and anxiety.
Thus, evaluating user engagement and other affective
and cognitive reactions in e-health and e-learning interventions is a top research priority (Michie, Yardley, West, Patrick,
& Greaves, 2017). Among the existing measurement methods,
electroencephalography (EEG) allows for real-time assessment of electrical signals in various parts of the brain. It
can detect patterns of mental activity associated with affective and cognitive reactions, including engagement (Li &
Lu, 2009; Mampusti et al., 2011; Murugappan et al., 2008).
However, EEG devices require users to wear dozens of electrodes while remaining completely still during the test, not
to mention the specialized training required to interpret the
results (Acharya, Hani, Cheek, Thirumala, & Tsuchida, 2016).
Beside EEG devices, other methods are more commonly used
to evaluate affective and cognitive reactions after online interventions. These methods involve users‚Äô self-rating of their
reactions on visual analog scales (VAS) but do not provide
real-time assessments during the interventions (Funke & Reips,
2012; Kuhlmann, Reips, Wienert, & Lippke, 2016; Reips &
Funke, 2008).
In response to these challenges, wireless EEG devices
have been developed. Although they cannot be substituted
to full-scale EEG for diagnostic purposes, these devices are
cheaper and use less electrodes, which reduces the time
required for installation and allows users to move during measurement. The devices come with interpretation software
products that compute real-time scores for different affective
and cognitive reactions. Up to now, wireless EEGs‚Äô tracings
have been compared to full-scale EEGs and their validity was
supported (Badcock et al., 2015), but the validity of the software interpretations remains to be scrutinized. Nevertheless,
wireless EEG devices are a promising and practical method
to measure users‚Äô real-time reactions that could be used to evaluate e-health or e-learning interventions. Accordingly, the aim
of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability
of using a wireless EEG device to measure affective and cognitive reactions of patients and healthcare professionals during
e-health or e-learning interventions.

METHODS
This prospective pilot study was conducted between April and
May 2017 in a Canadian cardiology hospital. The study was

www.nursingresearchonline.com

approved by the institutional review board (#2017-2134)
and registered at the ISRCTN registry (https://www.isrctn.
com; ISRCTN12825237).

Participants
Based on anticipated recruitment rate, we aimed to approach
20 eligible participants over 2 months. Eligible participants
were either patients expecting discharge from a coronary care
unit or professionals from the same setting. Written consent
was obtained from all participants.

Procedure
Upon enrolment, participants completed a sociodemographic
questionnaire, including age, gender, and education. A research
assistant then installed and calibrated a wireless EEG device
on their head. Participants were instructed to start the first
session of an e-health or e-learning intervention on a laptop
computer. Patients completed the procedure in their hospital room, and healthcare professionals completed it in a
closed office during a work shift. These conditions reflected
the course of events on the unit. There was a possibility that
participants could be interrupted to receive or provide regular
care at any time during the sessions. If they had not been
interrupted after 10 minutes, the research assistant ended
the experiment and asked participants to complete a questionnaire about their reactions to the intervention.

E-Health and E-Learning Interventions
Two interventions were used‚Äîone for patients and one for
healthcare professionals. Patients navigated through the first
session of TAVIE@COEUR (Cossette et al., 2017), an e-health
intervention designed to promote adherence to cardiovascular medication. Professionals viewed the first session of
MOTIV@COEUR (Fontaine et al., 2016), an e-learning intervention on motivational interviewing. A typical timeline of
the first 10 minutes of each intervention with actions assumed
to promote behavioral engagement (clicks and questions) is
presented in Figure 1. In both online interventions, participants
navigated through videos of a nurse providing topic-relevant
explanations (‚ÄúN‚Äù in Figure 1). They had to click on ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù
buttons to move from one video to the next.
Patients watched videos of a nurse addressing the importance of taking cardiovascular medication as prescribed
(3 segments  1 minute/segment) and on behaviors related
to medication (3 segments  1 minute/segment). They also
viewed a video of a patient sharing his experience with cardiovascular medication (2.5 minutes). On two occasions,
they had to answer yes/no questions; they also had to complete a questionnaire on drugs they were taking at home
(‚ÄúQ‚Äù in Figure 1), and they were presented with a short text
on these drugs (‚ÄúT‚Äù in Figure 1).
In the first video watched by healthcare professionals
(2 minutes), a nurse introduced brief motivational interviewing

and the learning objectives for MOTIV@COEUR. In the second video (11 minutes), the nurse presented the theoretical
basis of motivational interviewing. On three occasions,
videos showed text to emphasize the nurse‚Äôs explanations
(‚ÄúT‚Äù in Figure 1).

Data Collection
Emotive and Cognitive Reactions Participant reactions
were measured with a wireless EEG device and VAS. The
EPOC+ wireless EEG device (Figure 2) from EMOTIV (San
Francisco, CA) was used. The EPOC+ uses 14 electrodes
that are positioned per the 10‚Äì20 international positioning
system for EEGs (Acharya et al., 2016). Interpretation software for the device (MyEmotiv) computes real-time scores
for six affective and cognitive reactions: anxiety, attention, engagement, enjoyment, interest, and relaxation. Scores
range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higherintensity reactions.

During the sessions, participant scores were recorded
every minute for each of the six reactions. Therefore, a total
of 60 scores per participant (10 scores  6 reactions) was
expected. Of note, the software requires a sufficient signal
quality to compute the reactions, with some reactions requiring a higher signal quality than others. Accordingly, it was
possible that the software would not provide scores for
some reactions if the signal quality was not sufficient. Because
there was no previous report of the number of scores to
expect, we estimated that obtaining 75% of possible scores
was acceptable.
Immediately after the session, participants rated the
degree to which they experienced the six affective and cognitive reactions measured by the wireless EEG device by tracing
an X on a 10-cm VAS. The distance from the beginning of the
VAS to the X was measured and transformed into a 0‚Äì100
score (e.g., 67 mm = 67 points).

Feasibility and Acceptability Indicators drawn from the
literature on pilot studies (Feeley & Cossette, 2016) were
assessed and compared for patients and healthcare professionals: number of eligible participants who consented to
participate, reasons for refusal, time to install and calibrate
the wireless EEG device, number of participants who completed the full 10-minute sessions, participants‚Äô comfort
when wearing the device, signal quality, and number of observations obtained for each reaction. A VAS was also used to
measure participant comfort while wearing the wireless
EEG device.

Data were summarized with descriptive statistics, including
frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation (or median and minimum/maximum value if normality of the distribution was not achieved). Because the sample size was small,
groups were compared on the basis of visual inspection.

Although the validity and reliability of the software interpretation was beyond the scope of this pilot study, the participant scores on the reactions for which we obtained at least
75% of possible observations were graphed. The curves from
the graphed scores were compared to participant self-rating
of their reactions during the intervention. A search for differences in trends among patients‚Äô and professionals‚Äô scores
was performed; as they had been exposed to different interventions, different trends were expected.

RESULTS
During the study period, 18 eligible participants (10 patients
and 8 professionals) were approached. Of those, 13 were recruited and enrolled (six patients and seven professionals).
The recruitment rates were high at 60% for patients and
87.5% for professionals. Reasons for refusal included being
too tired or not interested. On average, patients were 58 years
old (range: 53‚Äì65); healthcare professionals were 36 years old
(range: 26‚Äì54). Patients identified mostly as male (n = 4, 67%),
and half had completed a college education (n = 3, 50%).
Healthcare professionals identified mostly as female (n = 4,
57%), were all nurses, and all had completed a university
degree (n = 7, 100%).
Feasibility and acceptability results are reported in Table 1.
For both groups, the median time to install and calibrate the
wireless EEG device was shorter or equal to other reports
(2‚Äì5 minutes; Harrison, 2013); it took longer to install the device on patients than on professionals. All participants completed at least 7 minutes of the sessions. Approximately half
of the patients (n = 3/6, 50%) and the professionals (n = 4/7,
57%) completed the full 10-minute sessions. Patients were
interrupted mostly because a healthcare professional walked
into their room; healthcare professionals were interrupted
because one of their assigned patients required care.

Comfort scores were generally high and similar for both
groups. Comfort scores for participants who did (Mdn = 8.7)
and did not (Mdn = 7.9) complete the sessions were also
similar. Nevertheless, visual inspection of the comfort scores
revealed that patients and professionals who did not complete the sessions reported higher comfort scores. Thus, it
appeared that participants ended the sessions because of
contextual factors and not because of uncomfortableness
with the wireless EEG device. However, healthcare professionals who completed the sessions reported slightly lower
comfort scores than those who did not. This could mean that
wearing the wireless EEG device for a longer period increases
discomfort. Signal quality was generally high throughout the
sessions. We were unable to obtain any observations from
one healthcare professional, even if the signal quality was
moderate at 85% during the experiment. This participant
was removed from the subsequent parts of the analyses.
In the protocol, we planned to calculate the number of
observations obtained over 10 minutes. Half of participants
stopped the sessions after 7 minutes. Therefore, most of the
missing observations in the last 3 minutes of the experiment
were due to the interruption of the procedure and not to
the wireless EEG device. Thus, the first 7 minutes of the experiment were used for analyses. As shown in Table 1, at least
75% of possible observations for professionals‚Äô attention,
engagement, enjoyment, and interest were obtained. This
threshold was not reached for anxiety and relaxation. Results for patients were similar, except for enjoyment, which
approached but did not reach the 75% threshold. However,
the threshold was reached with healthcare professionals,
and we decided to keep enjoyment for further analyses.
Affective and cognitive reactions are presented in Figure 3.

experiment were similar to the VAS scores measured after the
experiment. On the EEG and the VAS, professionals scored
higher than patients. As expected, the wireless EEG scores
varied throughout the sessions, providing real-time information on participant reaction; this variation was not reflected
in the single VAS measures obtained after the intervention.
The difference in patient and professional curves reflects that
they were exposed to different interventions and suggests that
the wireless EEG device provides a measure that was reactive
to the interventions, which supports its potential.

DISCUSSION
These results support the feasibility and the acceptability of
using a wireless EEG device to evaluate e-health and e-learning
interventions with hospitalized patients and healthcare
professionals. Recruitment rates were high, installation and

calibration of the device were feasible within a reasonable time,
participants were comfortable, and the device yielded the expected number of observations for most reactions. Data obtained with the wireless EEG device are promising; they show
variations in the intensity of reactions that are known to affect
the outcomes of e-health and e-learning interventions. The
strengths of this exploratory study include participants‚Äô blinding
to their EEG scores and the absence of missing data for the VAS
scores. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed in naturalistic
clinical conditions, thereby increasing the applicability of the results to real-world settings and future nursing research. However,
this is also a limit of the study: Some sessions were interrupted by
clinical events on the unit, resulting in missing EEG data. Although appropriate for a pilot study, the sample size was small,
and we only approached 18 out of the possible 20 participants
because of administrative issues. It is also important to note
that all participants in this study came from one setting and
were clinically stable‚Äîpatients were expecting discharge,
and professionals were assumed to be healthy.

Conclusions
Considering the strengths and limitations of this study, the results
suggest that the use of wireless EEG device warrants further
investigation. The next step would be to examine what components of the interventions affected participant reactions. This
could be achieved by combining wireless EEG and eye-tracking
measurements with a larger sample of patients and professionals.
Such studies could lead to adjustments of e-health and e-learning
interventions to increase their effectiveness regarding behavior
change and knowledge/skill acquisition. Also, it appears relevant
to test the wireless EEG device in other care settings and with
patients who present with different clinical states.
