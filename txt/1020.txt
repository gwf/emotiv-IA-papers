Jamal Ahmed, Abdul Majid, Idress Riaz, Sarah Bano , M. Anas & M.Ghazaal

Abstract—Non-invasive Electroencephalography (EEG)
based Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) is a growing
technology which provides a possibility for intuitive operation
comprising a multi-degree of freedom for upper extremity
prosthesis. In this paper, we investigate bio signal classification
concerns. Understanding bio signals and perform any action
on behalf of it is a difficult task to accomplish. This method
comprises of classification, feature extraction of EEG signals
and objective was to make process as simple as possible. In this
trial we first collected the patterns of four different types of
facial activities namely right smirk, left smirk, eye blink and
neutral activity. Firstly Samples were preprocessed. Wavelet
decomposition is used to extract features from signal and
IEMG and MAV are used to make feature vectors. Multilayer
perceptron (MLP) and Support vector machines are used for
classification. Results suggest that MLP can perform
classification task at high accuracy. Our proposed model
facilitates patient who are suffering from severe muscle injury
and disability. They can freely move around by means of facial
muscles regardless of any assistance.

There have several studies on controlling wheel chair
from brain signal without any manual control [6-9].
To use EEG signal it needs to be filtered from noise
which is in this case high frequency EEG signal and also
needed to be classified so that the computer can understand
it and perform some task on behalf of it. For this purpose
we have first collected the signal from brain for four types
of activities, i.e. eye blink, left smirk, right smirk and a
neutral activity. These signals are acquired using Emotive
EPOC Plus Neuro-headset [10] as shown in Fig. 2.

INTRODUCTION

I

N this era of modern world, everything becomes digital.
Brain computer interface is one of the emerging
technologies of this modern era. BCI was although invented
in 1924 by Hans Berger when he discovered the electrical
activity of the human brain. A BCI is a combination of
techniques for recording brain activity, extracting and
processing signals, and translating aspects of the signals
into computer commands, which are fed back to the user [14].
In this research paper we proposed a model as shown in
Fig. 1 to work on Brain signals for the sake of charity for
those people who are physically disabled, patients who
cannot move their hand or legs with their intentions due to
paralyzed or frozen body. These kinds of patients can be
helped by various methods. Tool which we have used is
Emotiv epoch+ which follows all international standards.
Brain computer interface can be used to help such kind of
patients. Clinical reports pointed out that approximately 50
% of patients, including paralyzed people are not able to
control Electric wheel chair by conventional methods
Specially MND patient [5,6]. In this context brain
controlled wheel chair is the mobility aid, especially
suitable for patients who are paralyzed and cannot control
the wheelchairs.

PROPOSED MODEL

Patients suffering with Motor Cortex dysfunctioning or
sever muscle injures make them liable to others; from eating
food to locomotion they are totally dependent. BCI
technology is strongest contender to make them selfdependent again. Brain controlled wheel chair is one step to
restore patient movement [8][9].Follwing is the explanation
of our proposed model

Where t is the time parameter, τ is the shift parameter and

given in the following equation.

A. Data Acquisition:
Signal acquisition was accomplished by Emotive Epoch
Plus, real data set collected from different subjects have been
used for this purpose. It is non-invasive device having low cost
with very high reputation amongst the high grade research
level equipment and the signals acquired by it are highly
reliable and sufficient for most of the applications [11-14]. It
measures neural activity of the subject with 14 electrodes
placed according to the international 10-20 system assisted by
Emotiv’s graphical user interface known as test bench [10]
displays signal as its recorded. The collected data is divided
into four classes, class A represent “neutral expression”, class
B is for “eye blink”, class C and class D represent ‘”left smirk”
and ‘’right smirk’’ respectively. Each class contains training
data of total 40 seconds captured in the interval of 10 seconds.
In every trial new data needed as bio signal varies due to
numerous reasons such as tiredness, pain, excitement.
Emotiv headset is made to cover complete EEG signal
spectrum but signals of facial muscle movement and eye
movement detect with high amplitude and power on frontal
electrode which are AF3, AF4, F7 and F8 Each electrode
provide 1024 samples per 10 seconds providing data matrix
of 1024x4, we recorded total of 40 seconds of data in one
trial which consist of 1024x16.

The significant projecting part of continuous wavelet
analysis is the preference of the particular wavelet function
Ψτ,s (t). Amid other wavelets functions the Morlet wavelets
function is being chosen because it is adeptly fixed in the
frequency domain. In accordance to the comparison of the
other wavelets the Morlet wavelet function has the identical
shape to the signal to be analyzed. Some reaches. [17,18]
 Discrete Wavelet Transform:
For the division of the signal into rough approximation
and brief information at non-identical frequency band to
determine the essential feature of signal the discrete wavelet
transform is utilized. The DWT is divided into two kinds of
stamp function that is scaling function related for low pass
filter and wavelets function related to high pass filter. The
division of the signal into non identical frequency is
achieved by continuous high pass and low pass filtering of
primordial signal researches using DWT [15, 16, 19].as
presented in Fig.3,

B. Pre – Processing:
To reducing the noise levels in this signal, narrow notch
filter of 50Hz is used to remove power frequency
interference. Normalization of the signal is done so every
signal lie between 0 to 1 this reduce the complexity because
each electrode’s data has values according to channel
spacing set in test bench.
C. Wavelet:
Wavelet Transform is an effective way of representing
the time - frequency domain element of the signal. The most
important point of WT is that at high frequencies it gives
precise information of time and at low frequencies it gives
precise frequency information of the signal. In timefrequency analysis Fast Fourier Transform is widely used,
but they are not good against non-stationary signals wavelet
is specifically appropriate for the non-stationary signals [15,
16]. There are two forms of wavelet analysis, i.e. discrete
wavelet transforms and continuous wavelet transforms.



Continuous Wavelet Transform:

When the signal x (t) is convolutes with the wavelets
function ψs (t) the continuous wavelets is formed

and the approximated signal a5.

DWT is fast, more practical then CWT, gives less
redundant data. Our research covers DWT, filtered and
normalized signal divided into sub bands which is known
asoutput which was counted by MSE (mean squared value).
The training algorithm RP (Resilient back propagation) is
used. It is the network training function which is used to
initialized the weight and biases fortuitously. The number of
data points in the training sets, the number of weights and
biases in the networks, and the error goal can be determine
by above discussed training parameter. When it is reached
to maximum number of epoch the training process stopped
and goal is attained.
Decomposition levels the level that defines the feature of
the signal is used for creating feature vectors with MAV
and IEMG [19].

The basic part of feed forward Neural Network is that the
output is known from the beginning. The constantly
adjustment of weights and biases took place to form the
output which is imminent to the anticipated value of the
output which was counted by MSE (mean squared value).
The training algorithm RP (Resilient back propagation) is
used. It is the network training function which is used to
initialized the weight and biases fortuitously. The number of
data points in the training sets, the number of weight and
biases in the networks, and the error goal can be determine
by above discussed training parameter. When it is reached
to maximum number of epoch the training process stopped
and goal is attained.
Feed forward MLP structure consist of one input layer
with two nodes, four hidden layers with fifty neurons each
and one output layer with four nodes as shown in Fig.4.

D. Classification:
In order to choose the most appropriate classifier for a
given set of features, the properties and limitations of the
available classifiers must be known.
Neural Networks (NN) are the category of classifiers
widely used in BCI research (see, e.g., [43] [44). To
compare the results of our model we also test SVM
classifier considered as the best binary classifier although it
can be used as multi classifier with help of one Vs. one
strategy.
 ANN Feed Forward Multi-Layer Perceptron:
An artificial neural network is computational method
based on biological neuronal network of brain. It is widely
used in researches for biological signal .A neural network is
consisting of nodes and arrow. The fundamental underlying
design of ANN includes number of nodes to choose how to
set the weight between the nodes, training the network and
evaluating the results.
Weight change from any unit ‘j’ to unit ‘k’ by gradient
descent i.e. weight change by small increment in negative
direction to gradient.

 Support Vector Machines:
Support vector machines considered as a fundamental
supervised machine learning technique that has attracted a
lot of researchers. Moreover, SVM is considered among the
best classifiers,

𝑤 𝑇 . 𝑥𝑖 + 𝑏 ≤ 1 , 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑥𝑖 ∈ 𝑁

The weight change from the hidden layer unit ‘j’ to

Where, W is termed the weight vector, b the bias (- b or
is termed the threshold), xi is an observation and P and N
present respectively positive and negative data. When it is
possible to linearly separate two classes, an optimum
separating hyper plane can be found by minimizing the
squared norm of the separating hyper plane. The
minimization can be set up as a convex quadratic
programming (QP) problem:

The weight change from input layer unit ‘i’ to hidden
layer ‘j’ is:

 One Vs. One:
The “one against one” strategy, also known as “pairwise
coupling”, “all pairs” or “round robin”, consists in
constructing one SVM for each pair of classes. Usually,
classification of an unknown pattern is done according to
the maximum voting, where each SVM votes for one class.

C. SVM Result:
Support vector Machine algorithm known as the best
binary classification algorithm although can converted into
multi classification algorithm where each multiple binary
classification provides the same results as multi classifier
and results in the fair classification accuracy utilizing
around 0.5 second which is very less as compare to the NN;
classification results in Table I .

RESULT AND ANALYSIS:

A. Wavelet Results:
Daubechies wavelet family is used for analysis in current
study, extensive tests on Daubechies wavelets orders db4
and db5 with decomposition levels D5 results suggests that
db5 is giving better classification results as shown in Table
I. It is concluded in our tests that db5 is the most effective
Daubechies wavelet order for our purpose; also compare
db5 results with db4.

D. Overall Results:
Trained classifier given quasi real time data and integrated
with electric wheelchair, the test results were averagely
acceptable as subject was fairly trained, test contains 10 trails
in 10 days each time classifier trained with new data, subject
had 10 chances to perform each given task, the cumulated
results NN and SVM for successful and failed attempt
shown in Table III.

B. ANN Results:
Feed Forward Multi-layer Perceptron is the work horse of
the Matlab’s neural network toolbox. With training function
“trainrp” which is very fast and achieve 1000 epochs in few
seconds we set parameters limits like validation check,
mean squared value (MSE) and gradient in such a way that
it reaches 1000 epochs. We also tested neural network with
different combinations of layers and different numbers of
neurons in a layer given in Table II. Our neural network
provides maximum 100% accuracy with configured
parameters.

IV.

CONCLUSION:

In our proposed research subject we presented a methodology
for wheel chair control using EEG. Presented method utilizes
Feed Forward Multilayer Perceptron as a classifier along with
wavelet for Time-Frequency analysis facilitating in Feature
extraction for the neural network.

Significance of this model is the low cost consumer grade
device Emotiv-Epoc Plus. Which requires less than 5
minutes to get fully functional in comparison with
traditional EEG recording device needing an hour to set up?
Our object was to create a system that require very short
interval of time to reach it operational state. We
successfully achieved our research objective and presented
a model that requires 5 to 10 minutes to setup up.
It is evident from results that time frequency analysis
using wavelet order db5 has given fruitful results. On the
other hand classification with NN results shows four
different accuracy levels. For 1st layer accuracy is
unacceptable. While 2 and 3 layer gives around 78% and
86% maximum accuracy with delay time 2 & 4 seconds.
th
Lastly 4 layer has around 99% accuracy with a latency of
5-6 seconds. Therefore we can say that it is a slight tradeoff
between successful classification and latency induced for

controlling of a wheel chair. In addition SVM multilayer
classifier with one vs. one strategy gives acceptable offline
classification around 80% to 90% consuming very little
time of 0.8 to 1 second but while online trails its accuracy
training was not up to the standard as NN. Hence a
wheelchair can be successfully controlled by facial
expressions.
