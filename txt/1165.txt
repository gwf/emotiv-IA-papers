The human health effects of singing bowls: a systematic review
Abstract
Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the human health effects (beneficial or
adverse) of any singing bowl therapies.
Design: A systematic review was conducted.
Setting: The setting was not specified, so it could include clinical and non-clinical settings.
Intervention: Studies of any intervention predominantly involving singing bowls (e.g. playing singing
bowls, listening to singing bowls) were eligible for inclusion. The comparison interventions were not
specified, and studies without comparisons (e.g. pre-post studies) were also considered potentially
relevant.
Main outcome measures: Any human health outcome was investigated.
Results: The effects of singing bowls on human health were investigated in four peer-reviewed studies,
one of which investigated patients with metastatic cancer, and another those with chronic spinal pain.
Low-level designs were used in two studies. Improvements in distress, positive and negative affect,
anxiety, depression, fatigue, tension, anger, confusion and vigour were reported, as were
improvements in blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation,
cutaneous conductance, and anterior-frontal alpha values.
Conclusions: Given there were few studies and the potential risk of methodological bias, we cannot
recommend singing bowl therapies at this stage. As the evidence suggests positive health effects we
recommend that future studies consider the effect of singing bowl therapist using more robust study
methods, allowing for evidence-based recommendations to be made to reduce the disease burden.
Keywords: Singing bowl, meditation, music therapy, health, systematic review

Background
Non-communicable diseases are a major burden of disease globally, with low back pain, migraines,
age-related hearing loss, iron-deficiency anaemia, major depression, neck pain, other musculoskeletal
disorders, diabetes, anxiety disorders and falls listed as the top 10 causes of years lived with disability
globally.1 Cost-effective, accessible prevention and management strategies for these conditions are
required to reduce this burden. Music therapy and meditation may play such a role.
Rationale
Music has had a long cross-cultural tradition,2 with the earliest musical instruments (flutes made from
bones or ivory of animals including vultures and mammoths) dating back 35 000 years.3 Music has
played a role in rituals, as well as healing. Music therapy was promoted by Pythagoras, Aristotle and
Hippocrates, and has had an enduring role in healing since.4 There is supporting evidence for positive
outcomes from contemporary music therapy targeting a range of health conditions,5-12 including
mental illness12 and pain.11 Similarly, meditation has a long tradition in health and well-being with
contemporary evidence indicating that meditation is effective in managing some of the leading causes
of years lived with disability, such as depression,13 anxiety,13 and pain conditions.13, 14
Singing bowls have been associated with Tibetan culture, and are friction idiophones. 15 They are
traditionally made of bronze alloys,16 and more recently quartz crystal,17 and are played by rubbing
the rim of the bowl with a leather-wrapped or wooden mallet; they may also be struck.16 The bowls
have been used as part of religious ceremonies, including meditation. 16 Therapies involving singing
bowls combine some of the elements of both meditation and music therapy, and may therefore
provide an effective strategy for reducing the symptoms of some of the conditions identified above as
being the leading causes of years lived with disability. Indeed, singing bowl therapies have now been
implemented in hospital treatments.18
Despite an anecdotal, recent increase in interest and engagement in therapies involving singing bowls,
the human health effects of playing and/or listening to singing bowls has not previously been
3

examined in a systematic review; the highest level of evidence for supporting (or otherwise) the
efficacy of clinical interventions.19 The objective of this systematic review is therefore to determine
any human health effects (beneficial or adverse) of singing bowl therapies in any population, to fill the
identified evidence gap and to provide recommendations for the potential public health and/or clinical
use of singing bowls.
Methods
The review protocol was reported <reference removed for blinding> prior to commencing the review.
Data sources
A systematic search of seven library databases (Cochrane Library database, Ovid Medline, Web of
Science (all databases), Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (EbscoHost),
Health Source (EbscoHost), and Embase was conducted in October 2019, with the terms “singing bowl”
OR “singing bowls” searched in the title, abstract and keyword fields. No limits were applied to the
search.
Inclusion/ exclusion criteria
All identified studies were exported into Endnote X9, where duplicates were removed, before
screening the titles and abstracts for potential inclusion. Eligibility criteria are primary studies
(qualitative and quantitative) reported in full within peer-reviewed journals, and investigating any
human health effects of using or listening to any type of singing bowl. Studies using singing bowls as
part of music or sound therapy were only included if singing bowls were the main type of sound
therapy. The citation lists (Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar) and reference lists of all
included studies were checked for additional potentially relevant studies, and were then screened,
using the criteria outlined above. Study inclusion/ exclusion was determined by the two reviewers
independently.

Data extraction
Relevant data from the included studies were manually extracted, independently by the two reviewers,
into a purpose-build spreadsheet, with the headings study design, year(s), location and setting,
population and sample characteristics, details of the intervention(s) (e.g. duration, frequency, type of
bowls used), outcomes and outcome measures, the timing of data collection, compliance, statistical
methods used, and study findings (both beneficial and adverse health outcomes). All types of
summary measures were reported.
Included quantitative studies were allocated to the National Health and Medical Research Council
(NHMRC)19 Hierarchy of Evidence for intervention studies, and methodological bias was examined
using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale;20 a valid and reliable assessment tool.21-23
The PEDro scale is the only assessment tool for methodological bias, to our knowledge, that has
undergone Rasch analysis;21 thus, strengthening the validity and reliability of the tool. Although the
PEDro scale was designed primarily for use with randomised controlled trials, the scale has been used
with non-randomised controlled trials as well,24-26 with some of the validity and reliability testing also
including non-randomised controlled trials.21 Assessment of methodological bias was only conducted
for study designs of level III_1 and above, due to inherent biases in lower level designs. 24, 27, 28
Allocation of studies to the NHMRC Hierarchy and assessment of methodological bias were conducted
independently by the two reviewers.
Data synthesis
Data were synthesised descriptively.
Results
Study characteristics
A total of 74 studies were obtained from the database search, and the full texts of seven of these
studies17, 29-34 were screened for potential inclusion. Four studies17, 29, 33, 34 were ultimately included in
5

our review (Figure 1), with details of these studies reported in Table 1. Three17, 33, 34 of the four studies
were published in the last five years; two17, 33 were conducted in the United States of America, and
one each were from Italy34 and Germany.29 Landry33 conducted a randomised cross-over trial (NHMRC
Level II) and Wepner et al.29 conducted a randomised controlled trial (NHMRC Level II), while Bidin et
al.34 and Goldsby et al.17 used pre-post designs (NHMRC Level IV). Owing to the use of a lower level
design for the other studies, potential methodological bias was only assessed fortwo studies3329.
Landry’s33 study scored 60% on the PEDro scale, with concealed allocation and blinding of the
participant, therapist and assessor not being reported. Wepner et al.’s29 study scored 30% on the
PEDro scale, having not reported concealing allocation, comparisons of the groups at baseline,
blinding (participant, therapist or assessor), whether any data were missing, and whether all
participants received the treatment as intended (or analysed by “intention to treat”).
Wepner et al.29 investigated the impact of singing bowl therapy for those with chronic, spinal pain,
comparing singing bowl therapy (with the quartz bowl struck while placed on the participant’s back),
a placebo treatment (where the bowl was not struck), and a control group (no intervention). Bidin et
al.34 investigated individual singing bowl therapies in patients with metastatic cancer, while Landry33
investigated the addition of singing bowls to a meditation (in comparison with silence followed by
meditation), both in ‘healthy’ adults. Goldsby et al.17 investigated a group meditation session with
singing bowls being played in an undefined population. Bidin et al. 34 and Goldsby et al.17 also utilised
other instruments along with the singing bowls, however singing bowls predominated. None of the
studies involved participants playing the singing bowls themselves, instead they listened to the bowls,
and in Bidin et al.’s34 and Wepner et al.’s29 studies the bowls were placed on specific points of the
participants’ bodies. Bidin et al.’s34 intervention was carried out over three months (six sessions in
total) and Wepner et al.’s29 over four weeks (six sessions in total), while the other two studies only
investigated single sessions (see Table 1 for details of the interventions).

6

A range of outcomes was investigated across the four studies. These outcomes included pain, tension,
anger, confusion, distress, anxiety/depression, fatigue, quality of life, disability, positive affect,
negative affect, sleep duration, blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability, respiratory rate,
cutaneous conductance, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation, and electroencephalogram measures
(see Table 1).
Study findings
The results of the subjective measures will be discussed first, followed by the objective measures.
Singing bowl therapy resulted in a significant decrease in both positive and negative affect in Landry’s33
study, however this decrease was also evidence in the comparison group (silence followed by
meditation), with no significant time x intervention interaction detected. Wepner et al.29 found
significant time x group interactions for current pain intensity and pain intensity on average over the
past four weeks. The only significant change in subjective measures reported by Bidin et al.34 was an
increase in distress when measured using the Distress Thermometer, but not when using the
Psychological Distress Inventory. Although Bidin et al.34 reported no significant change in anxiety,
depression and fatigue, Goldsby et al.17 reported significant improvements in each of these outcomes.
In addition, Goldsby et al.17 reported a significant reduction in tension, anger, confusion and vigor,
while it was unclear whether any change in pain was statistically significant. Bidin et al.34 also found
that the treatment did not result in an improvement in quality of life (see Table 1 for details). Goldsby
et al.17 also stratified their analysis by age and näivity with singing bowl therapies (i.e. no previous
exposure) for anxiety, depression and tension (see Table 1 for the results).
Landry33 and Bidin et al.34 both investigated objective outcomes. Landry33 reported that there were
significant reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate from baseline to
post-treatment, however these findings were also detected in the comparison group, and there was
only a significant intervention x time interaction for the systolic blood pressure and heart rate. Bidin
et al.34 also reported significant reductions in resting heart rate, respiratory rate, tonic and phasic

7

cutaneous conductance and anterior-frontal alpha values from the electroencephalogram, and a
significant increase in heart rate variability and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation. There were no
significant differences in the objective measures in Wepner et al.’s 29 study.
Compliance was only applicable to Bidin et al.’s 34 study, which was of a longer duration. The overall
reported compliance was 83%, with reasons for non-attendance reported as other appointments or a
worsening of clinical conditions. Five participants in Landry’s33 cross-over study did not return for their
second session (second intervention following the cross-over). No adverse events were reported,
however only Landry33 clearly reported that no adverse events had occurred.
Discussion
In the first systematic review to examine the effect of singing bowls on human health outcomes, we
identified four studies, all of which reported some evidence of a beneficial impact on human health.
Benefits were reported in terms of distress, positive and negative affect, anxiety, depression, fatigue,
tension, anger, confusion and vigour, as were improvements in blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory
rate, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation, cutaneous conductance, and anterior-frontal alpha values.
These findings, as well as additional reports of health benefits in non-peer-reviewed resources or as
abstracts only,29, 35-39 suggest that the use of singing bowls may have health benefits, however the
evidence as it stands is insufficient to recommend their use. In the following sections we discuss the
findings of this review in more detail, and provide recommendations for future research into the
health effects of singing bowls.

Two of the included studies17, 34 used pre-post designs, which is one of the lowest levels of evidence,19
owing to the inherent biases in this design. Pre-post designs are, however, appropriate in proving
preliminary evidence for the feasibility of the intervention and the study methods, as was
appropriately specified as the purpose of Bidin et al.’s34 study. Landry’s33 and Wepner et al.’s29 studies
used a higher level study design, a randomised cross-over design, however bias may have been

8

introduced primarily due to the lack of blinding. The nature of singing bowl therapies means that both
the therapist and the participant will know which intervention is being applied, hence only singleblinding of the assessor can feasibly be achieved. While triple blinding cannot be achieved, the lack of
blinding is still a source of potential bias that should be addressed in future studies.

All of the studies included subjective outcome measures. Each of these measures results in ordinal
data, not continuous data, yet none of the included studies referred to Rasch analyses to confirm the
utility of the measure, and to transform the measures to interval-level data. The implications of not
using measures that have undergone Rasch analysis has been described by Grimby et al.,40 and limits
our confidence in the findings of each of these studies. Furthermore, the clinical significance of all
outcome measures reported in the three included studies were not discussed. It is therefore
recommended that future studies that investigate the effect of singing bowls on human health either
use scales that have undergone Rasch analysis and use the transformed interval-level scores, or
conduct such an analysis using their data (with appropriate discussion of the clinical significance of
the findings). Undertaking these steps will enable clinicians, and public health practitioners, to make
clinical decisions and recommendations for the use of singing bowls as additional interventions to
reduce the disease burden.

It will also be important for future studies to ascertain which aspects of singing bowl therapies result
in the health benefits. It has been suggested that the benefit of singing bowls is the vibrations they
create, not the sound itself.36 If however, the sound itself results in a health benefit, then recordings
of singing bowls could be used, making singing bowl therapies more accessible. None of the included
studies investigated the effect of singing bowl therapies where the participant/patient played the
bowls themselves. It is possible that playing the bowls may have additional benefits over passive
therapies; playing a singing bowl requires the player to focus so that a steady speed and pressure is
achieved, which may provide additional benefits, particularly in terms of relaxation.
9

Our search was comprehensive by searching seven databases using only terms related to the
intervention, and screening the citation and reference lists of included studies. Furthermore, not limits
regarding the language or year of publication were applied. We therefore believe that all relevant
studies were obtained. If any studies had been missed their inclusion is unlikely to have changed the
conclusions of this review.

Conclusion
We identified promising evidence for the health benefits of singing bowl therapies, however as
research in this area is in its infancy, we cannot at this point recommend it as a form of therapy. Studies
should continue to investigate the health effects of singing bowl therapies to confirm the benefits and
safety of such therapy, including robust study designs, appropriate outcome measures, and
consideration of the clinical significance of any identified changes in outcomes. With an increased size
and quality of the evidence base we may be able to recommend singing bowl therapies as costeffective, low risk therapies to reduce the prevalence and impact of some of the health conditions
that result in the greatest burden of disease, including mental illness.

Intervention(s)

Intervention group: 6 x 30 min
sessions across 4 weeks. Sessions
had 20 min of singing bowl therapies.
Quartz singing bowls were used,
which played the notes A, F or G.
Bowl was placed on the participant’s
back, struck at a level the participant
found comfortable.

Intervention group: 12 min of B flat singing
bowl exposure + 20 min listening to
directed relaxation recording.
Participant and investigator on couch with
bowl adjacent. The Investigator rubbed rim
15 sec., trail off to silence, then struck
softly every 15 sec. x 4. Sequence repeated
for 12 min.

“Metodo Bagno Armonico®” approach (citing Pigaiani41)
Three bowls of diameter 14-16, 23-26, and 28-32cm

Bidin et al.34
Subjective outcomes
No significant change for distress when measured with
Psychological Distress Inventory, but Significant change
for Distress Thermometer scores (2.4 vs 5.3, p<0.001)
Objective outcomes
Significant decrease in tonic and phasic cutaneous
conductance (3.03 v 1.64, p=0.009, and 0.87 vs 0.53,
p=0.006, respectively), and resting heart rate (83.2 vs
75.7, p<0.001). Significant decrease in breath rate (14.4
vs 13.9), however p=0.063 [Not actually significant].
Significant increase in peripheral capillary oxygen
saturation (96.7 vs 98, p<0.001).d Significant increase
in heart rate variability (19.7 vs 22.2, p=0.004).
Note: for the above objective measures it is unclear
which time points were compared (e.g. before vs after
a session, first vs last session).
Reported a significant decrease in heart rate variability
comparing pre-tests of the first and last sessions (7 vs 6,
p=0.05), and for post-tests of the first and last sessions
(11 vs 9, p=0.21), although p-values indicate no
significant difference.
Significant decrease in anterior-frontal alpha values
from the electroencephalogram (85.5 v 75.9, p=0.046).
Note: for the above electroencephalogram measures it
is unclear which time points were compared (e.g.
before vs after a session, first vs last session).
No adverse events were reported.

The authors did not report whether
adverse events were reported or not.

0.41, p=0.003), and for those aged 40-59 years
(0.66 vs 0.38, p=0.12).
It is unclear whether the pain changes were
significant.
The authors did not report whether adverse
events were reported or not.

Notes:aItem 1 is not included in the score. bIt is unclear what the measurements for the bowl size in Goldsby et al.’s 17 study refer to (e.g. diameter). cThe references for Bidin et al.’s34 subjective outcome measures
were only reported in text, not in the reference list; hence we were unable to cite these references in the reference list of our review. dThe difference in the number of significant figures/ decimal places matches what
was reported by Bidin et al.’s.34 eit is unclear what the timings refer to (e.g. the duration of sitting or the time at which the measures were taken).
