Abstract
A recent technology which makes possible for us to interact with automated systems without using any body part is called Brain
Computer Interface (BCI). In its concrete applications, electroencephalogram (EEG) is benefited by a BCI environment for being
capable of obtaining brain waves. In our study, evaluation of success rates of the predictions made by C x k - Nearest Neighborhood
(Cxk-NN) Algorithm for EEG Eye State Data whose states are called “Opened Eye“ and “Closed Eye“ is applied. This EEG Eye State
dataset is obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository on the web and it is a highly-used benchmark data on this field. As there
are only two classes of the signals, we test binary classification performance of our classification algorithm (Cxk –NN). Comparison of
those values with the ones obtained by the other successful classification algorithms in the literature applied on the same data set
also take place in our study. Cxk-NN is an instance-based classification method advanced from simple k – Nearest Neighborhood
Algorithm, and improved success results are observed when it is compared with k-NN.
Keywords: brain computer interface (bci), classificaiton, eeg, c x k - nearest neighborhood algorihtm.

I. INTRODUCTION
The brain which is the center of decision and balance has a complicated structure. Especially,
human brain has a more difficult to understand structure than other animal brains. The systems that
enable people to give instructions to digital computerized mechanisms without using anybody’s limb,
are aimed at forming a communication bridge between human brain and the device being
commanded others (He, 2005; Schalk, McFarland, Hinterberger, Birbaumer & Wolpaw, 2016;
Wolpaw, Birbaumer, Heetderks, McFarland, Peckham, Schalk & Vaughan, 2000).
The main input elements of this research field which is called as generally BCI (Brain Computer
Interface) in short in the literature are human thoughts. The idea of being able to read those thoughts
as inputs is based on the emergence of electrical signals in some parts of the human brain when a
person imagines something in his mind. Consequently, those types of signals should be recognized in
an electronic environment. These systems are quite beneficial especially for patients of ALS and
people suffering from some sort of strokes others (He, 2005; Schalk, McFarland, Hinterberger,
Birbaumer & Wolpaw, 2016; Wolpaw, Birbaumer, Heetderks, McFarland, Peckham, Schalk &
Vaughan, 2000).
In today’s world, a lot of methods such as magneto encephalography, electrocorticography, near
infrared spectroscopy, local area potentials, functional magnetic resonance visualization, EEG and
single cell records are used in BCI. Among those techniques, undoubtedly, EEG is the most widespread
one because it provides more ease-of-use than the others (He, 2005).
EEG has a capacity to make measurements 1000 times in a second (once in a millisecond). It detects
electrical change in channels linked to the electrodes placed over some parts of the sculp. The
Potential Difference between two extreme sides of electrodes those are measured as the unit of mV
(millivolt) and this alteration is recorded depending on time. Brain signals are taken over hair skin
since it does not cause any pain on the subject others (He, 2005).

II. THE PHASES OF BCI
A. Preprocessing

Preprocessing is one the basic processes of BCI (Fig. 1). The signals taken from the brain are not at
the sufficient level to be ready for feature extraction phase as preprocessing operations are inevitable.
EEG signals do not only transmit neurological information produced in thinking process, but they also
convey data from the sources in which we are not interested and these data are known as noises. It is
quite difficult to make an operation on the data combining of many sources of noise. Noises involved
in EEG signals should be eliminated by being exposed to a preprocessing operation (Aydemir &
Kayikcioglu, 2011).
Figure 1. The Basic Functional Elements of BCI others (Aydemir & Kayikcioglu, 2011).

Emerging Technologies. 6(3), 158-165.

Because of the fact that EEG signals have very low amplitudes, noises easily come to appear on
those signals. They get exposed to be affected by external elements like the existence of devices
which emit electromagnetic waves in the environment or light spreading from a lamp and physical
movements such as moving an arm from left to right, heartbeats and eye-blinking.
In the literature, there are plenty of efficient noise elimination techniques. The most common ones
among them are Independent Component Analysis, Linear or Non-linear Filtering, Wavelet
Transformation, Principal Component Analysis, Fourier Transformation and Source Dipol Analysis. The
most critical source of noise in BCI is based on eye-blinking. This type of noise is especially detected on
the electrodes located in brain rear lobes which are near to the eyes others (He, 2005).
The other preprocessing operations apart from noise elimination methods are taking average,
determining a threshold value, and normalization.
B. Feature Extraction

Feature extraction is the operation of obtaining features after operation of determining important
attributes of recorded EEG signals when thoughts differ. For example, when a disabled individual
who cannot use his hands in a normal way thinks of changing position of a cursor on computer, how
EEG signals get in shape becomes a feature extraction operation. Each generated feature vector can
complete a signal, but in the classification phase; none of them may not give a correct result.
Therefore, distinct characteristics should be used together to acquire a high success ratio. Each
extracted feature may not define a signal and none of them may give 100% correct response in the
classification phase. For this reason, different features should be used together in order to obtain a
high success ratio others (He, 2005).
Another fundamental point is to decide to choose the most suitable electrode in order to extract
features when making an analysis on EEG data recorded via multiple electrodes. Different parts of
the brain are more sensible for different sorts of task. For instance, hearing senses are processed in
the occipital lobe of the brain. As a result, it would be a better idea to utilize data taken from the
parts of the brain where cerebral activity is much more intensive instead of benefiting from the
whole data coming from multiple electrodes covering all parts of the brain because this situation
reduces time spent in the classification phase when decisions should be taken and provide
opportunity to find the best features for classification.

In Figure 2, the application of International 10/20 System in the operation of placing electrodes is
given. The letters written on each electrode represent a special sub-lobe. Those letters and their
meaning are listed below.
 FP: Prefrontal Lobe
 F: Frontal Lobe
 T: Temporal Lobe
 C: Central Lobe
 P: Parietal Lobe
 O: Occipital Lobe.
The number that was shown at sub index, points out the location of electrode in brain hemisphere.
Z symbolizes the exact middle line of brain, odd numbers symbolize somewhere in left hemisphere
and even numbers symbolize a place over right hemisphere. The nearer the distance between the
electrode and middle line, the less number gets closer to 0 others (He, 2005).
C. Classification

Dividing EEG signals recorded in diverse visual and mental situations into classes according to their
feature vectors is a significant issue in BCI. The decision of which signal should belong to which class
must be rapid and correct. There are many different classification methods in the literature. Among
the most widely used ones of them, Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighborhood, Linear
Discriminant Analysis, Neural Networks and Bayesian Classification take place (Aydemir &
Kayikcioglu, 2011).
We have made a classification over EEG signals labeled to Eye-Blinking Situation signals during an
experiment of a subject and recorded using an EEG signal acquisition device called Emotiv having 14
channels that are found in UCI Machine Learning Repository by applying C x K – Nearest
Neighborhood Algorithm proposed by Ulutagay and Nasibov which is similar to k-Nearest
Neighborhood Algorithm in this study. We have detected the ratio of belonging to correct class of the
data by sending single signals that we had already know to which class they belong to C x K – Nearest
Neighborhood Algorithm as test data. We have got successful results in these data including binary
classification for EEG signals. The aim of this research we made is to demonstrate that C x K – Nearest
Algorithm can make a more successful classification than k-Nearest Neighborhood Algorithm, which
is a basic algorithm, when classifying binary EEG signals. At the same time, we aimed at testing
reliability of the algorithm which we will require for multiclassification over EEG signals in our other
studies (Dogan & Nasibov, 2016; Nasibov, Ozgoren, Ulutagay, Oniz & Kocaaslan, 2010; Nasibov &
Ulutagay, 2010; Ulutagay & Nasibov, 2016; Ulutagay & Nasibov, 2009).

III.

C X K - NEAREST NEIGHBORHOOD ALGORITM

The C x K – Nearest Neighborhood approach is an improved version of the well-known k- Nearest
Neighborhood (KNN) algorithm. In this approach, the value whose class is not obvious is put into a
class by taking the distances of its k-nearest neighbors from each class into consideration. First of all,
all distances among all nodes are calculated mathematically, so how close or how far a node is to one
another becomes clear. K nearest samples from each class to node having no determined class,
totally C x K number of nodes are analyzed. The letter C here represents the number of classes. The
name of the algorithm comes from this expression. The average of distances between a node to be
classified and k-nearest nodes to this node is calculated. Thus, average distance between the node
that does not have a clear class yet and each class is obtained. Among those distances, the class

161

Emerging Technologies. 6(3), 158-165.

having the nearest distance is labeled as new class of the node to be classified (Dogan & Nasibov,
2016; Nasibov &Ulutagay, 2010).
Let

be a set of n labeled samples,

be

the priori known classes, be the number of elements in class where
.
The pseudo-code of C x K - Nearest Neighborhood Algorithm is given below (Ulutagay & Nasibov,
2016; 2009).

CxKNN Algorithm:
BEGIN
Input x of unclassified data,
Set K, 1 ≤ K ≤ n
FOR EACH CLASS Cj
DO UNTIL ( K – nearest neighbor found in class Cj )
Set i = 1.
Calculate the distance between x and
IF ( i ≤ K ) THEN
Assign

to the set of K – nearest neighbors in Cj

ELSE IF (
is closer to y than any other previous neighbor )
THEN
Delete the farthest sample in the set of K nearest nighbors.
Assign
to the set of K – nearest neighbors in Cj.
END IF
i=i+1
END DO
Calculate the average distance dj of x from K – nearest neighbors of class Cj.
END FOR
Mark the class with minimum distance dx = minjdj;
Classify x in the class r of the last minimum found.
END (Ulutagay & Nasibov, 2016; 2009).

For example, according to the algorithm, if we have two classes with the names of C1 and C2 and
k = 3, then we look at 3 data which are nearest to the node from class C1 and 3 nearest data from
class C2, 6 nodes in total. We take the average of distances from the node whose class is unknown to
the 3 nearest nodes from each class. If the one belonging to C1 from those averages we found is less
the new class of the node becomes C1. Otherwise, it becomes C2. The functioning principle of C x K –
Nearest Neighborhood Algorithm is in this way. If k = 1, there will be no need to take average. The
class having a nearest node becomes the new class of the node. That is to say, this class becomes the
class that contains this node. In this case, the same results with k – Nearest Neighborhood Algorithm
are acquired.

DATASET

Our dataset is EEG Eye State Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/EEG+Eye+State#)
taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository and comprises EEG signals recorded during a specific
time period (117 seconds) when an individual subject opens and closes his eyes. “Eye State” attribute
is added in the last column of these EEG data and the value of this attribute with respect to each

single data is assigned to 0 if subject’s eyes are open, to 1 if they are closed (Nasibov, Ozgoren,
Ulutagay, Oniz & Kocaaslan, 2010).
EEG signals are obtained as saved records to a text file including many rows. Each row refers to a
single node. Totally 14980 data are recorded consecutively to a text file depending on time. In coding
process, we have converted these data on a text file into a proper format in order for the values of
each signal in different electrodes to be read in a correct way. As explained in UCI Machine Learning
Data Repository, these signals are acquired by utilizing Emotiv EEG Signal Record Device (Nasibov,
Ozgoren, Ulutagay, Oniz & Kocaaslan, 2010).

V. EXPERIMENTAL STUDY
At first, learning data, independent from test data, are divided into 10 parts having equal sizes
randomly and in such a way that they constitute a homogenous distribution from all data belonging
to both two classes for 10-folds cross validation process. Afterwards, data from each fold are
considered like test data and success ratios using C x K – Nearest Neighborhood and K – Nearest
Neighborhood algorithms with best possible k values. In Table 1, the results which belong to C x K are
demonstrated and in Table 2, the ones for K-Nearest for the test dataset are shown. A comparative
result for folds averages is given in Figure 4 (Dogan & Nasibov, 2016).

As can be seen clearly in Table 1, Table 2 and Fig. 3, although “Open Eye” data outnumbers the
other class, data from each class are taken in similar numbers to each other and homogenous
distribution is not ignored in this way.
When we observe the result for other k values, we notice that C x K - NN algorithm provides an
improvement having an increase up to 2% in the comparison of success results. Also, when we take a
look at the best k values, in the process of cross validation, the values of 2, 3 and 4 with the success
ratio of 0,969 for C x K-NN algorithm and the value of 1 with the success ratio of 0,967 for K-Nearest
Neighborhood Algorithm are seen clearly as the best values (Dogan & Nasibov, 2016).

VI.

CONCLUSION

We have noticed in our study that C x K – Nearest Neighborhood Algorithm has given a quite
successful results for Eye State Dataset which is a sample of a binary EEG signals. Those promising
outputs we obtained in this experiment has motivated us to get significant classification success with
C x K – NN algorithm for other BCI studies.
