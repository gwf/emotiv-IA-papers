Abstract: We present a preliminary data-based assessment of measurement reliability of the
commercial 14-electrode Emotiv EPOCTM EEG wireless system in distinguishing between
electrophysiological states of emotional function, as compared to a standard research-lab
stationary 32-electrode EEG system for personalized single-individual use. Individual observers
completed two tasks designed to elicit neural changes in emotional arousal and valence while
simultaneously recording their EEGs with both systems in separate sessions. Participants observed
emotion-laden words from the ANEW database and images from the IAPS database, both widely
used and validated databases for emotional processes in multidisciplinary research. The pattern of
results distinguished between high and low arousal and valence states using the stationary
traditional system, but not the commercial device. Also, the latter device recorded EEG band
frequencies at a much lower resolution and frequency range than the standard system. These
findings suggest poor validity when using the commercial device and therefore should be
cautioned against in a research setting.

1. INTRODUCTION
The identification and classification of human emotions
using electroencephalography (EEG) is a major
research focus for developing Brain-Computer
Interface
(BCI)
devices.
Translating
electrophysiological signals from a person’s scalp into
quantifiable data (event-related potentials, or ERPs) is
useful for programming computer systems to
recognize emotional content in facial expressions and
vocal inflections [1] and allows software-based
intelligence systems to adapt their function to a user’s
overall emotional state in real-time [2]. The need for
cost-effective EEG systems that can reliably distinguish
between emotional states is growing in importance;
EEG systems with a greater number of electrodes
enable researchers to provide higher resolution
recordings of electrophysiological activity but also
require a lengthy preparation time to arrange the
electrodes and test the signal amplification. Public and
private businesses seeking to employ BCI devices to
enhance their operatives’ functionality are often
interested in EEG systems with fewer electrodesminimizing preparation time while potentially
sacrificing the quality and resolution of the
electrophysiological signal recordings. Recent reports
have demonstrated that there is indeed some research
utility for consumer-grade devices such as the Epoc as
compared to other similar devices such as the
Neurosky MindWave [3]. However both of these
devices’ performance is questionable compared to
proper research-grade EEG [4].
The push to incorporate classification algorithms
within these devices is prominently associated with the
alluring
promise
of
personalization,
singleindividualized use according to which the BCI system
might be calibrated and fine-tuned to the individual
characteristics of the person's brain/mind (which
assumes an “N = 1” approach). Our current
investigation provides novel evidence against relying
on consumer devices for research grade tasks,
specifically
in
this
case
for
measuring
neuropsychological aspects of emotional states
(stimulus valence and arousal). Most current research

with consumer-grade devices is limited since it uses
only the consumer device itself; failing to demonstrate
validity and reproducibility of results by comparison
with a juxtaposed research grade device.
We
overcome this limitation by directly comparing the
data acquired from a consumer grade EEG to that of a
research grade EEG under the same conditions using a
within-subject design.
We acquired two adjacent EEG systems for their
potential application as a part of a brain-computer
interface: the Brain Vision Easy Cap EC40 headset and
the actiCHamp active channel amplifier system
(henceforth Brain Vision of BV) as well as the Emotiv
EPOCTM EEG wireless system (henceforth abbreviated
simply as Epoc). The Brain Vision Easy Cap is a standard
research grade 32-electrode headset, whereas the
Epoc headset is a consumer grade device with only 14
electrodes, but boasts a much more elegant userfriendly
design.
In
addition,
it
transmits
electrophysiological data wirelessly via a BluetoothTM
transmitter, bypassing the signal processing
traditionally performed by an external amplifier. While
preparation time is minimal (10-15 min on average, as
compared to 45-60 minutes for BV), the Epoc headset
does not have any electrodes placed along the midline
of the head, and it uses two reference electrodes on
both sides of the head corresponding with the parietal
lobe (P3 and P4) as opposed to using a single ground
electrode along the midline as reference in traditional
EEG systems. Furthermore, the electrodes are placed
on the scalp without any gel substance serving as an
intermediate for electrical conduction, thereby further
limiting the ability to perform EEG source analysis
(approximating the anatomical source of temporal
electrical activity). For this reason, a viable test of
comparative measurement reliability with other
systems can be done through measurement of global
or whole electrical brain activity. This is the approach
we took in this preliminary study.
In this study, we evaluated the Brain Vision Easy Cap
EC40 and the Epoc EEG systems on their efficacy and
reliability in differentiating between varying levels of

NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH NOTES | 2019 | VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 1 | PAGE 8

two distinct dimensions of emotion, emotional arousal
and valence [4]. We presented human subjects with
two experimental tasks designed to examine if the
Brain Vision system could be used to distinguish
between states of high and low arousal and high and
low valence, based on patterns of event-related
frequency band potentials (ERBPs) in response to the
presentation of emotionally-salient words or visual
stimuli. Importantly, we report novel findings regarding
the comparable signal quality of each device and the
inability of Epoc to reproduce the results seen using
the BV device.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Participants
Participants were three healthy graduate and
undergraduate students (mean age 24.66 years old)
serving as trained research assistants. This study
followed all ethical guidelines on human participant set
out by the host institution. All participants were righthanded males with corrected-to-normal (N=2) or
normal (N=1) vision, and none reported any history of
neurological impairment or were currently using
psychoactive medications. The average number of
hours of sleep on the previous night was 7.5 hours.
Testing was conducted from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. with a
one-hour break in between on two separate days. The
pre-experimental short adult version of the mood and
feelings questionnaire [5] were administered by an
independent research assistant unaware of the
hypotheses and goals of the study to screen mood
differences or emotional changes before the
experimental sessions between days. No remarkable
differences were reported as all participants scored
similarly (overall score range: 3-5) in the two days and
consistently well below the recommended clinical cutoff (possible maximum = 26; clinical cut-off = 11).
2.2 Experimental design
The participants completed two tasks sitting in front of
a computer monitor while undergoing ERP analysis
using the 32-electrode Brain Vision EEG system, and
repeating both tasks two days later while using the 14electrode Epoc EEG system. In the first task, subjects

observed a series of selected images from the
International Affective Picture System (IAPS). IAPS is a
large standardized database of images, where each
image carries a rating based on its three dimensions of
emotion: valence, arousal, and control/dominance [6].
Emotion-laden pictures that had previously been
categorized by the target parameters of valence and
arousal were used to designate the image as high or
low arousal/valence, previously shown to correlate
with known EEG signatures [7,8]. Similar to this
research, a recent fMRI study has shown that the
emotions evoked by these images effectively separate
the emotions into distinct arousal/valence quadrants
[9]. The calibration for these emotion-laden
localizations occurred across participants. We preselected 100 high arousal and 100 low arousal images
(high and low arousal determined by their rating in the
database) as well as 100 high valence and 100 low
valence images for use in our study. We presented
each participant with a randomized selection of 100
images (25 high arousal, 25 low arousal, 25 high
valence, 25 low valence) on a computer monitor while
recording their electrophysiological activity via the
Brain Vision headset. The stimulus presentation
program began with a central cross fixation to help
participants focus their gaze and reduce eye
movements. After 200 ms, the first image was
presented for 4500 ms, followed by a 1300 ms
presentation of the cross fix preceding the second
image. Participants were specifically instructed to try
to form an emotional connection with each
image/word presented and to remain as still as
possible while viewing images/words. Images filled a
48.3 cm (19”) monitor with a 1024 x 768-pixel
resolution. Letters were presented at a font size of 48
points and presented in the center of the monitor.
In the second task, subjects observed a series of
selected words from the Affective Norms for English
Words (ANEW) database.
ANEW is another
standardized inventory of normative emotional ratings
for a large number of words in the English language; it
was developed to complement IAPS [10]. Previous
research using the ANEW has plotted the normative

NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH NOTES | 2019 | VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 1 | PAGE 9

ratings in 2-dimensional space and found the
distribution effectively complements the IAPS using
EEG [9]. We presented each participant with a
selection of words from the ANEW database on a
computer
monitor
while
recording
their
electrophysiological activity (the same procedure as
with the IAPS images, this time with words); one series
of words with the Brain Vision headset, and another
series with the Epoc headset.
2.3 Event-related band potentials and signal
amplification
EEGs were recorded for each participant during the
tasks. The Brain Vision EEG recordings were obtained
from electrodes held in place by means of an elastic
cap (Easy Cap, Brain Vision, Morrisville, NC, USA)
adhering to the ten-twenty system of measurements
[11] with 32 active low-noise pin-type Ag-AgCl
electrodes (1 mm each) amplified (sampled up to 1000
Hz) and recorded reference-free. Standard external
landmarks (i.e. the inion, the nasion, and left and right
pre-auricular points) were the basis for the montage
distribution with electrodes positioned as percentage
distances from these landmark points (see Figure S1 in
Online Supplementary Materials). All impedances
were kept under 25 kOhms so that they provided an
effective electrical signal with minimal noise. The Epoc
recordings were collected as is with no additional
materials or measurements other than the device
itself.
EEG signals were amplified, and low pass filtered at
100 kHz via the actiCHamp active channel amplifier
with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. All electrodes were
offline re-referenced to a common average reference
(i.e. the average was subtracted from each electrode
for each time point). Offline averaging was performed
such that event-related frequency band potentials
(ERBP) were averaged separately for each stimulus
type and condition for each electrode with an Epoch of
-200 ms pre-stimulus to 1000 ms post-stimulus. ERBPs
included the individual trials to code high and low
arousal, high and low valence. For details and analysis
outputs, please see Online Supplementary Material.

2.4 Statistical analysis
For our statistical analysis, it was necessary to evaluate
whole brain ERBP because the precision of the
electrode placement in the Epoc could not be
confirmed. Hence, there is no validity without this and
comparing electrodes of one system with the other is
fruitless. Additionally, we used a Vincentization
technique for the EEG data which involves the
averaging of three or more subjects’ quantile functions
in order to obtain group quantiles [12-14]. This
statistical technique allowed us to construct F values to
evaluate differences between the five frequency bands
adopting a by-item approach, where the electrodes are
the unit of analysis (cases).

2.5 Ethics statement
Upon review of the submission materials, following
Article 2.1 the Tri-Council Policy Statement Carleton
University Research Ethics Board determined that this
study did not require prior review or approval by the
Board. Documentation and signed consent were
waived. Documentation of consent was obtained by
recording computerized log-ins during voluntary
participation.

arousal and valence with the IAPS Task
The two panels below (Figure 1) summarize the
frequency band analysis for examining arousal and
valence using the IAPS task. Figure 1A displays the
distinguishing of high and low arousal states using the
Brain Vision system and Epoc system. A two-way
analysis of variance revealed that the observed

system; differences in frequency band (Delta, Theta,
Alpha, Beta, Gamma) were significant for the Brain
Vision system only (F (1,31) = 63.224, p < 0.01); and the
interaction between arousal condition and frequency
was also significant for Brain Vision only (F (1,31) =
12.303, p < 0.01). Figure 1B displays the comparison
between high and low valence states using the Brain
Vision system and the distinguishing of high and low

valence states using the Epoc system. A two-way
analysis of variance revealed that the observed
differences in the valence condition (high valence vs.
low valence) was statistically significant for the Brain

differences in frequency band (Delta, Theta, Alpha,
Beta, Gamma) were significant for Brain Vision only (F
(1,31) = 72.550, p < 0.01); and the interaction between
valence condition and frequency was also significant
for Brain Vision (F (1,31) = 51.138, p < 0.01).

3.2 Distinguishing electrophysiological states of
arousal and valence with the ANEW task
The two panels below (Figure 2) summarize the
frequency band analysis for examining arousal and
valence using the ANEW task. We plotted the means
of the frequency band amplitude, measured in
microvolts (µV) averaged across participants and
electrodes.
Figure 2A displays the comparison
between high and low arousal states using the Brain
Vision system and the Epoc system. A two-way analysis
of variance revealed that the observed differences in
the arousal condition (high arousal vs. low arousal) was
not statistically significant for the Brain Vision system
(F (1,31) = 0.085; p = 0.772) nor the Epoc system (F
(1,13) = 7.185, p = 0.019); differences in frequency
band (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma) were
significant for the Brain Vision system only (F (1,31) =
34.156, p < 0.01); and the interaction between arousal
condition and frequency was significant for the Brain
Vision system (F (1,31) = 53.339, p < 0.01) but not the
Epoc system (F (1,13) = 2.191, p = 1.54). Figure 2B
displays the high and low valence states using the Brain
Vision and Emotiv system. A two-way analysis of
variance revealed that the observed differences in
condition (high valence vs. low valence) was not
statistically significant for either system; differences in
frequency band (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma)
were significant for the Brain Vision system only (F
(1,31) = 26.690, p < 0.01); and the interaction between
valence condition and frequency was significant for the
Brain Vision system only (F (1,31) = 40.048, p < 0.01).
3.3 Alerting correlations of Epoc and BV
Correlational data (Table 1 & 2) below provided some
alerting trends among the different systems and tasks.
Here we used the approach outlined by Rosnow,
Rosenthal, and Rubin (2000) which describes the use of
leveraging aggregate correlations of group means
rather than individual scores for identifying overall
trends and assessing validity [15]. Using this alerting
correlation method, we identified trends among ERBP
and the different task conditions. In both Table 1 and
Table 2 it can be noted that the Epoc ERBP has a very

poor and often inverse relationship to that of the BV
which questions the validity of the Epoc.
4. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS
The results of this preliminary study suggest that the
wireless 14-electrode Epoc system can be used to
show small differences in general electrical activity
between psychophysiological states of high and low
arousal, and high and low valence (particularly in the
delta, theta, and alpha frequency ranges). The
observed differences, however, are not statistically
significant such as with the stationary Brain Vision
device. Therefore, the use of the Epoc device lacks the
degree of fidelity that is required to properly
distinguish these states within a personalized design
which would be very undesirable in a research setting.
The findings offer evidence against the validity of
consumer-grade systems for research grade tasks,
although their low fidelity ability to distinguish states
may still be useful for some EEG-based BCI
applications. The Epoc, and similar consumer-grade
devices with a limited number of electrodes could be
strongly improved simply by designing a product which
adheres to conventional EEG electrode placement.
Using the common electrode placements would lead to
improved comparative capabilities with traditional EEG
devices/existing EEG studies, better-referencing
montages, and increased translatability of anatomically
related conclusions.
During the ANEW and IAPS tasks whereas the Brain
Vision system detected high levels of gamma
frequency band activity, the Epoc system consistently
failed to replicate this finding. We hypothesize that
this difference can be attributed to technical aspects of
the 14-electrode setup such as the lack of a signal
amplifier. The Brain Vision system uses an ActiChampTM
signal amplifier which enables it to detect higher
frequencies of electrophysiological activity—higher
beta oscillations and gamma oscillations. In contrast,
the
Epoc
wireless
headset
transmits
electrophysiological recordings directly from the scalp
to a USB-A dongle in the signal processing computer.

This interface for amplifying signals may be in part
responsible for making higher beta and gamma
oscillations harder to detect. A more sophisticated
amplification would drastically improve the signal
quality of consumer devices, but the cost required to
do so would not be consumer friendly.
For the ANEW task, differences in frequency band
amplitude between high and low valence states were
not significant, whereas the interaction between
valence condition and frequency was significant. This
discrepancy is likely due to the close proximity of the
emotion-evoking ratings in the high valence and low
valence conditions. Future studies should examine this
result using a greater difference between the mean
rating of the words used in the two conditions of the
ANEW task.

In conclusion, we demonstrate further evidence for a
consumer EEGs’ inability to reproduce differences that
are distinctly obtainable using a research EEG device
[16]. We were able to demonstrate this with a small
number of subjects by using the statistical technique of
Vincentization. Given that the goal of most emerging
approaches using EEG-based machine learning and
categorization algorithms is ultimately intended for
personalized individual consumer use, the fact that the
present perspective focused on a demonstration based
on a small sample size cannot be considered as a major
limitation. The experiment was done at the same grade
(scale) as that of the intended consumer usage: in
other words, it focusses on usability in one person, not
groups of people.

Overall, we urge caution to researchers planning to use
a consumer device for important research experiments
but do acknowledge that devices like the Emotiv have
some benefits such as being wireless, quick to set up,
are extremely portable, and could still be useful in
some BCI applications where signal quality and validity

are not paramount. For instance, exerting BCI control
over an external device (i.e. wheelchair, prosthetic
arm) can be done by calibrating any signal to a function
of the device (i.e. move forward, backward, side to
side, extend/retract reach).

Notice, in this example the ability for the BCI to
differentiate valence/arousal emotional states is not
necessary. In this case, the goal is to make the system
successfully work for the user, not to produce valid
signatures of emotion. On the other hand, if the goal of
a study has anything to do with emotional states, like
using an Epoc to investigate clinical neuropsychiatric
populations for emotional dysregulation in mood
disorders or any cognitive neuroscience experiment of
emotion in which you need to be confident in the
validity of your signal, the consumer-grade devices

must be cautioned against. Therefore, we argue that
the issue is not so much that consumer devices have
no place in the research laboratory, but rather that
their use and data interpretation need to be done
appropriately in contexts in which they are valid. Upon
this investigation, using an Epoc EEG device to
determine emotional states in individuals would have
questionable validity as it is not reproducible using
research grade EEG. The validity should not be
assumed as simply coming in a box, together with the
device!
