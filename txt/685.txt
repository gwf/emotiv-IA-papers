Abstract
This study investigated EEG correlates of social interaction at distance
between twenty-five pairs of participants who were not connected by any
traditional channels of communication.
Each session involved the application of 128 stimulations separated by
intervals of random duration ranging from 4 to 6 seconds. One of the pair
received a one-second stimulation from a light signal produced by an
arrangement of red LEDs, and a simultaneous 500 Hz sinusoidal audio signal
of the same length. The other member of the pair sat in an isolated sound-proof
room, such that any sensory interaction between the pair was impossible.
An analysis of the Event-Related Potentials associated with sensory stimulation
using traditional averaging methods showed a distinct peak at approximately
300 ms, but only in the EEG activity of subjects who were directly stimulated.
However, when a new algorithm was applied to the EEG activity based on the
correlation between signals from all active electrodes, a weak but robust
response was also detected in the EEG activity of the passive member of the
pair, particularly within 9 – 10 Hz in the Alpha range. Using the Bootstrap
method and the Monte Carlo emulation, this signal was found to be statistically
significant.

Introduction
The study of EEG correlates of social interaction is a hot topic in the
world of social neuroscience, described as follows by Cacioppo &
Berntson (2002): “Social neuroscience addresses fundamental questions about the mind and its dynamic interactions with the biological
systems of the brain and the social world in which it resides”.
The study of EEG correlates of social interaction ranges from simple face-to-face motor interactions (e.g. Hari et al., 2013), to empathy (Singer & Lamm, 2009), to interpersonal motor co-ordination
(Oullier et al., 2008; Sebanz & Knoblich, 2009). A recent review
of the current status of the field, particularly in reference to social
cognition, is given by Chatel-Goldman et al. (2013). This review
highlights the importance of not underestimating possible non-local
mechanisms that can emerge from person-to-person interactions.
These mechanisms are defined as “dependent operations between
two or more brains that operate at least in part on shared information content” and are also described as interactive alignment,
resonance, phase synchronization, and non-local correlations.
Is it conceivable that these mechanisms can be detected even when
two persons are mentally interacting without the possibility of
sensory information exchange?
This possibility is rarely studied, not so much because of technical
or methodological difficulties, but because the prevailing view is
that the human mind can only receive information through the five
senses and anything else is impossible. Nonetheless, if we assume
that the human mind is also capable of receiving and processing
information transmitted from other than the five senses, it becomes
possible to investigate the characteristics of mental activity related
to the interaction between two sensorily isolated individuals.
This model of mind function, also defined as “non-local” because it
is not limited to the spatial and temporal confines of the five senses,
is predicted by various theoretical models. For example, according to Dual-Aspect Monism (Atmanspacher, 2012), there is neither
a material reality nor a mental reality – rather, they are two different aspects of one reality. These mental characteristics are also
consistent with Generalized Quantum Theory (GQT) proposed by
Walach & von Stillfried (2011), and Filk & Römer (2011).
This theory predicts mind-to-mind and mind-to-matter non-local
correlations similar to the entanglement phenomena observed in
quantum physics if the following conditions are fulfilled:
1) A system is given, inside which subsystems can be identified.
Entanglement phenomena will be best visible if the subsystems
are sufficiently separated such that local observables pertaining to
different subsystems are compatible.

2) There is a global observable of the total system, which is complementary to local observables of the subsystems.
3) The total system is in an entangled state. For instance, eigenstates of the global observable are typically entangled states.
The theory of Generalized Entanglement assumes that a distant
social interaction between two persons who know each other must
satisfy these requirements:
a) the two persons represent two subsystems of a single larger
one created by their relationship, and
b) this relationship constitutes an entangled state, and furthermore that
c) the measurable psychological and physiological variables
represent the system’s comprehensive characteristic even
though measured individually.
However it is important to point out that when dealing with mental observables, the identification and operationalization of the
subsystems within a global one, and their complementary and/or
compatible characteristics, is still an open problem.
The study presented here is a further addition to this field of research.
In comparison to other research, our specific objectives are:
1) To determine the difference in power or other statistical
characteristics of the EEG signal between the person receiving the physical stimulus and his/her mentally connected
partner;
2) Determine the latency period, if any, between the EEG
signals and the stimulus of both partners;
3) Determine the frequency ranges of EEG activity that best
represent the connection between the subject pair.
To date, we have identified 29 published studies starting from
1965 which have addressed this possibility using EEG activity as
a dependent variable (see Table S1 in the Supplementary Material).
Unfortunately due to the types of EEG sources analyzed and the
statistical analyses used to test the existence of a non-local social
interaction, it is very difficult to meta-analyze them. In this study
we will present a new method for the analysis of EEG signals which
proved superior to the classical ones.

Methods
Subjects
Six Italian Caucasian healthy adults were chosen for the experiment, comprised of five men and one woman, with an average age
of 35.5 years (standard deviation = 8.3).
They were selected among the members of the EvanLab, the private laboratory involved in this study. The criteria for their voluntary inclusion were their mutual friendship (> 10 years), and
their experience in being able to maintain prolonged focused
concentration – a product of their familiarity with meditation and
other practices requiring control of mental activities.

Statement of Ethics
The use of experimental subjects is in accordance with ethical
guidelines as outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study
has been approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of
Padova’s Department of General Psychology. Before taking part
in the experiment, each subject gave his/her informed consent in
writing after having read a description of said experiment.
Equipment
A software program, available at http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/
m9.figshare.1466876, especially written by one of our co-authors
(GW) administered the sequence of stimuli and synchronized the
EEG recordings from each member of the pairs. EEG activity was
measured using two Emotiv® EEG Neuroheadsets, equipped with
14 EEG channels, connected via WiFi to a Windows PC.
The technical details are: 14 electroencephalography channels
based on international location from 10 to 20 (AF3, F7, F3, FC5,
T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, AF4, plus two reference
electrodes). The mastoid electrodes (M1, M2) served as reference
points against which the voltage generated from all other electrodes
was compared. The sample frequency of the Emotiv® headsets is
128 Hz, with a bandwidth from 0.2 to 45 Hz, with a built-in fifth
order low-pass digital filter as well as two notch filters at 50 and
60 Hz respectively as protection against noise produced by the local
electricity network. The Emotiv® EEG has a proprietary wireless
network connection at a frequency of 2.4 GHz.

Stimuli
The auditory stimulus was composed of a 500 Hz sinusoid applied
through 32 Ohm Parrot ZIK® earphones at a volume of about
80 dB. The visual stimulation was from high intensity red LEDs in
a 4×4 arrangement placed approximately one meter from the subject being stimulated. The subject kept his/her eyes closed because
the light could easily be detected through the eyelids.
Procedure
The members of each pair were placed in two separate rooms
approximately five meters from each other. Each room was soundand light-proof, so as to block out any and all external sensory
information.
Between these two rooms was a control room with two computers
connected to the Emotiv® headsets and from which the research
assistant controlled the sensory stimulation program and each partner’s EEG recording (see Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). The
software program in use ensured that the signals coming from the
two EEG headsets were recorded simultaneously (to within 8 ms).
The partner designated as “Sender” was given the following instructions: “When you are ready, relax and be prepared to receive a
visual and auditory stimulus which you will send to your partner.
To assist your mental connection with him/her, concentrate on
his/her photo before starting the experiment. Your only task is to
mentally transmit what you will perceive, while limiting your body
movements to prevent interference with your EEG activity. You will
perceive 128 stimulations of 1 second each, separated by pauses of
random length lasting 4 to 6 seconds in order to avoid predictable
rhythms. The experiment will last about 10 minutes.”

The partner designated “Receiver” was given the following instructions: “When you are ready, relax and be prepared to receive the
stimuli sent from your partner. To assist your mental connection
with him/her, you will see a facial photo of him/her before starting
the experiment. Your task is to mentally connect with him/her and
try to perceive the stimulus he/she is receiving, while keeping
your body still to prevent interference with your EEG activity. The
experiment will last about 10 minutes.”
Once the quality of the EEG signals was confirmed, and with the
consent of the subjects, the research assistant began running the
experiment’s program. To prevent either subject from predicting
when the first stimulus would be given, it was preceded by a period
of silence of random duration from 2 to 3 minutes.
At the end of the experiment, after a period of rest, in most cases
(if subjects agreed and time allowed) the role of each subject was
reversed.
All together data from 25 pairs of subjects was collected over
three days. The raw data are available at http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/
m9.figshare.1466876 which include details of pairings.

Bias control
To avoid any experimenter’s effect, the research assistant who
managed the software for the data acquisition were blind to the
exact start of the stimulation sequence, given the randomization
of the duration of the first pre-stimulation period as described
above.
The reduction of the risk of any conventional communication
between the pair of participants, was guaranteed by the sensory isolation of the two rooms were they were placed as already described.
The only remaining possibility was to speak aloud each other, but
this event could clearly be noticed by the research assistant.

Results
Data analysis
Collection of the evoked potential was initially conducted by filtering the signals in the 1–12 Hz band followed by normalization (see
software code of Appendix 1 at http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/022046),
hence employing the traditional averaging method of time- and
phase-locked epochs. The typical result of an evoked potential
obtained from Senders can be seen in the graph in Figure 1.
The average Event-Related Potential (ERP) of all 25 files from
Senders and Receivers was also calculated. To get the total sum of
evoked potentials from all subjects while avoiding ERP different
latency period problems, each subject’s individual evoked potential
powers were added up. The resulting graph is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2 clearly shows an ERP in the Senders, but nothing of
interest in Receivers.
Following this negative result we began using an original method
which we named GW6, created by one of our co-authors (WG),
and described in detail in Tressoldi et al. (unpublished; pre-print
proof available at http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/07/06/022046),

which was found more resistant to jitter and interferences compared to the traditional averaging method. Furthermore, as
described below and in more detail in the original paper, this new
processing method is far less prone to unwanted effects of EEG
artifact because as the Pearson Correlation depends only on signal
phase and not to amplitude.
This method is based on the Pearson correlation between segments
of data of fixed length L, as shown in Figure 3.
As an example, the Emotiv® EEG Neuroheadset provides NC = 14
EEG channels and a sample frequency of 128/s; the stimulus is
1 second duration and an epoch’s length is 3 seconds, equal to 384
samples. In this case it becomes possible to calculate the R(x) array
in a number of combinations of pairs equal to: Nt = NC*(NC - 1)/2 = 91.
The result can be written using a new array, R(I, X), in which
I = 1... 91 and X = 1... 384 are the calculated values. The stimulus is administered at the same time as sample no. 128 and ceases

after one second, with sample no. 256. The next processing step
involves the average of R(I, X) over all the given stimuli, the result
designated as R’(I, X).
Therefore, for each value of I = 1.... 91 a baseline is calculated,
comprised of the average of R’(I, X) in the pre- and post- stimulus
areas. Finally a new array is calculated, Sync(I, X), based on the
result’s absolute value: Sync(I, X) = Abs(R’(I, X-Baseline)).
Then the average of all the Nt combinations gives us the final array,
Sync1(X), which represents the total variations of the EEG correlations during a 3 second epoch, for all stimuli and all EEG channels.
It is also possible to calculate a similar array, Sync2(C, X), for each
channel, C.
To be extra certain, the analysis of experimental data was nonetheless conducted on longer epochs – up to 4 seconds – comprised
of 1.5 seconds pre-stimulus, 1 second stimulus, and 1.5 seconds

post-stimulus. To calculate the probability that the observed differences in baselines are due to chance, the experimental data were
compared to those obtained with a simulation conducted using a
bootstrap procedure with the following characteristics:
a) Signals from the desired frequency range (in our case 9–10 Hz in
Receivers and 1–16 Hz in Senders) are filtered using a digital filter
that leaves signal phases intact, according to the Discrete Fourier
Transform (DFT) and its related inverse processing. The filtered
files are then saved. We point out that for Senders the standard
frequency range (1–16 Hz) was used because the ERP is usually
generated in this range.
b) The same processing method (The GW6 method) is applied to
these files, but choosing at random the point in which a stimulus
is thought to be present. For each file, the same number of stimuli
(128) are evaluated, as in the experimental tests. For each file at least
20 bootstrap calculations are made, eventually resulting in over 500
files. The average of these calculations constitutes the blue bootstrap curve in Figure 4 and Figure 5, which therefore represents the
expected probability due to chance, to compare with the obtained
experimental curves (red). This method appears valid in that it gives
a virtually flat curve (blue), close to zero throughout.
In Figure 4, a distinct peak (red curve) is seen which represents
a correlation ERP at about 300 ms from the start of the stimulus,
followed by a weaker peak at the end of the stimulus. This graph
is similar to the one obtained from standard averaging in Figure 2,
only expanded.
In Figure 5, with respect to the Receivers, there is an area that
exceeds the normal chance expectation represented by the bootstrap
curve. This area is highlighted in yellow and can be calculated as
the difference with respect to the bootstrap curve.
A similar analysis was conducted by filtering signals within the 1
to 16 Hz band (as in the Senders) with statistically null results, and
subsequently in the 8 to 16 Hz band, followed by the 8 to 12 Hz, but
the best result was obtained in the 9 to 10 Hz range (see Table 1).
We concentrated our analyses on the alpha-theta bands which proven
more sensible to distant correlations in previous similar studies.
Due to the limitations of our EEG detection apparatus we did not
proceed in a deep analysis of the sources (locations) of the observed
effects, a very important detail. Preliminary analyses suggest the

occipital and frontal locations as potential sources of the observed
effects.
As far as it concerns the latency period between the stimulus
and the EEG response, in the senders this time is about 300 ms
(see Figure 4), as normally expected, whereas in the receivers the
maximum response is found at about 700 ms after the remote stimulus onset (see Figure 5).
If this latency will be confirmed in future experiments (in preparation) this observation will be of great importance for the comprehension of this phenomenon. For example, it could mean that
the receivers do not perceive the stimulus itself, but the change of
consciousness state of the sender.

Statistical control
After having established an increase in cerebral correlation in
Receivers coinciding with the remote stimulus given to Senders,
it is necessary to determine the importance of this difference with
respect to the statistical chance. To this end, instead of resorting
to conventional statistical methods, often inapplicable to complex
situations such as this, we used an emulation procedure of the
Monte Carlo type consisting of the following steps:
a) Take the bootstrap files within the desired frequency band – in
our case from 9 to 10 Hz (around 500 files), or from other bands. All
of these files are the result of a GW6-type processing and are now
the input data set for the Monte Carlo emulation.
b) 25 “fake” files are randomly chosen and their final average is
calculated, in the same way as the average of the 25 “real” files.
c) The difference in area with respect to the average of all the
500 bootstrap curves is calculated, as in Figure 5. This difference
may be either a negative or positive number.
d) Determine if this number is higher than that obtained from the
real experimental files. If it is higher, a counter is incremented.
e) Start again from a) and repeat the cycle as required (we repeated
the cycle 2000 times).
At the end, determine how many times out of 1000 a group of
25 bootstrap files randomly exceeds the value of the area found
experimentally. The results give the probability of obtaining a surplus of area by chance, as in Figure 6. This procedure does not use

Figure 6. The graph shows the distribution of 2000 Monte Carlo emulations with respect to Receivers’ files filtered in the 9 to 10 Hz

value is exceeded by chance 3 out of 2000 times.

any specific a priori statistical model, and is based solely on applying
numerous emulations exactly as with real data. As shown in Table 1,
in the 9 to 10 Hz band the result is significant to a level of around
2–3/1000, equivalent to P ≤ 0.003, and is even significant in the
8 to 12Hz band, with P ≤ 0.04. The almost Gaussian distribution of
the values shows that the method is valid and agrees with normal
statistics.

Discussion
When traditional methods of averaging and calculations for ERP
power are used, there is a distinct evoked potential in the EEGs of
subjects who are Senders, but not in the EEGs of Receivers.
Conversely, when the GW6 method is used and the signals within
the 9–10 Hz band are filtered, we obtain the results shown in
Figure 5, which are statistically confirmed by the Monte Carlo Emulation. These outcomes lead us to believe that Receivers exhibit a
weak response to the remote stimulus in the form of a small change
in cerebral synchronization coinciding with the stimulus. This variation approximately equates to a 0.5% correlation, with a maximum
of about 1.5–2.0% in the best subjects under examination. Even
though the applied method does not display a result in the form of
a wave similar to that seen in the Senders’ ERPs, this result does
however open the door to future investigations aimed at identifying specific patterns of weak but significant responses in Receivers. This study is clearly explorative but it is in agreement with the
results observed in three different experiments by Hinterberger
(2008) who observed an increase in the ERPs in the Alpha (8–12 Hz)
band only in the related pairs of participants. If further confirmed,
these findings would be of huge scientific importance because they
provide neurophysiological evidence of a connection – or social
interaction – at distance.
It is important to point out that our experimental design is by its
nature not able to distinguish between classical and non-local interactions. As in quantum physics, also here a Bell-type experiment

would be necessary to distinguish between classical signal transfer
and nonlocal correlation. Instead, here we only looked for correlations similarly to other studies of this type (see References and
Table S1).
Regarding future developments in this area, we will attempt to identify EEG signals in Receivers while applying a gradual reduction in
the number of stimulations. Continual advances in techniques for
processing EEG signals allow us to be optimistic in reaching this
objective.

1. In the Introduction you write:
“Our study is a further contribution to this line of research, but for the first time within the social
neuroscience and the GQT framework.”
I do not understand why you think that you for the first time link GQT and social neuroscience. You
only did an experiment of the type many others did before in a very similar way. Therefore, please
omit the second half of the sentence.
2. I do not understand the meaning of this sentence and the NT seems to be strangely introduced
here:
“It is important to point out that our experimental design is by its nature not able to distinguish
between classical and non-local interactions even if the GQT implies a “no-signal-transfer (NT)
theorem” that is only an acausal correlation between two complex neurophysiological observables
of two entangled subsystems of a total global system.”
My suggestion to indicate the limitations with respect to the GQT is:
“It is important to point out that our experimental design is by its nature not able to distinguish
between classical and non-local interactions. As in quantum physics, also here a Bell-type
experiment would be necessary to distinguish between classical signal transfer and nonlocal
correlation. Instead, here we only looked for correlations similarly to other studies of this type (see
References)."

Thank you for the improvements and adding the list of studies. I still have some concerns which I think
should be regarded in order to be scientifically correct. They refer to your responses on my points raised
above:
2. I still do not see all preconditions for the applicability of the GQT fulfilled. As you do not show that you
should not state that "this relationship constitutes an entangled state". The GQT cannot be applied to any
complex system. There are complex systems that behave just classically when split up into parts. Further,
the random generator experiment of Walach can be connected with GQT as it analyses the matrix of
physical and psychological variables and thereby excludes a signal transfer. In this aspect, your
experimental design is rather of a classical nature and its non-local entanglement nature cannot be
proven with it. Therefore, again, I suggest you to be more careful in the introduction.
3. Again, why did you choose the bands 1-16, 8-16, 8-12 and 9-10Hz? Why not the standard EEG bands?
Or have you analyzed the other frequency bands? Then, it would be honest to report also the other
frequency bands and correct for multiple testing. Searching for the highest effect in the data and reporting
only this is statistically invalid.
6. If possible, please provide a mapping or some information showing the spatial distribution of the effect.
Should be no problem as you have the data and the algorithms.

it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined

entanglement nature cannot be proven with it. Therefore, again, I suggest you to be more careful in
the introduction.
Reply: It seems your concerns are related to our statements:
“A distant social interaction between two persons who know each other satisfies these
requirements [for mind-to-mind and mind-to-matter non-local correlations] provided that:
a) the two persons represent two subsystems of a single larger one created by their
relationship, and
b) this relationship constitutes an entangled state, and furthermore that
c) the measurable psychological and physiological variables represent the system’s
comprehensive characteristic even though measured individually.”
We agree that these hypotheses must be tested empirically, but are coherent with those
put forward by Walach et al. (in press) in testing mind-to-matter non local correlations
postulating an entanglement between participants and the RNG.
What if in the new version we introduce the above paragraph with the following premise: “
When dealing with mental observables, the identification and operationalization of the
subsystems within a global one, and their complementary and/or compatible
characteristics is still an open problem. In the present study we will assume that… ” ?
As far as the no-signal-transfer (NT) theorem, in the third paragraph of the Discussion
section of version 2 we explicitly declared that “…what we are observing is not a
transmission of signals from the sender to receiver participants, but only a correlation
between two complex neurophysiological observables..”
3. Again, why did you choose the bands 1-16, 8-16, 8-12 and 9-10Hz? Why not the standard EEG
bands? Or have you analyzed the other frequency bands? Then, it would be honest to report also
the other frequency bands and correct for multiple testing. Searching for the highest effect in the
data and reporting only this is statistically invalid.
Reply: We agree. In the new version we will explicitly declare that we concentrated our
analyses on the alpha-theta bands which in previous similar studies proven more sensible
to nonlocal correlations.
6. If possible, please provide a mapping or some information showing the spatial distribution of the
effect. Should be no problem as you have the data and the algorithms.
Reply: We agree that this information could add more details to the characteristics of the
nonlocal correlations, but given the limitations of our EEG apparatus, we did not proceed
at present time in the source analysis.
In the future studies we will add the search of the spatial distribution of the effect and the

In the future studies we will add the search of the spatial distribution of the effect and the
more active locations.

Please let us know whether you agree with these revisions before we submit version 3.

Regarding 2:
I would suggest instead of: "A distant social interaction between two persons who know each other
satisfies these requirements..."to write: "The theory of Generalized Entanglement assumes, that a
distant social interaction between two persons who know each other must satisfy these
requirements..."
Then, as you suggested please insert the sentence:
“When dealing with mental observables, the identification and operationalization of the subsystems
within a global one, and their complementary and/or compatible characteristics is still an open
problem. In the present study we will assume that…”
Regarding my comment on non-signal transfer:
My point of critics was not that you expect "only" correlations in your experiment. It is more that you
should state that your experimental design is by its nature not able to distinguish between classical
and non-local interactions because if your experiment is successful and replicable, it can be used
for signal transfer as well. You should add a sentence which makes this clear. Therefore, your
sentence "…what we are observing is not a transmission of signals from the sender to receiver
participants, but only a correlation..." is wrong because you don't prove that. These kind of
correlations still could have a classical explanation!
Regarding 3:
OK. But please don't say " ...more sensible to nonlocal correlations." Better would be " ...more
sensible to distant correlations." as I said, you don't prove non-locality.
Regarding 6:
Some hints about the contribution of electrode positions to the effect can be given without
calculating source localizations. You can keep this simple.

Thank you very much for these clarifications we have now considered in the new version of the
paper. On pag. 1 we have clarified which requirements are necessary to satisfy the condition for a
Generalized Entanglement between two distant persons. On pag. 8 we clarified why we did not
proceed in the source analysis and on pag. 9, how our findings fit with the no-signal-transfer (NT)
theorem.

1. The work is interesting and well done, in terms of the experimental work and data processing, both
part of EEG signal processing and a statistical approach.
2. The abstract describes very precisely the content of the article. The addressed research stage is
clearly exposed and has direct addressability with the experiment described in this article and it is
well supported by bibliographic references.
3. The analysis method of ERP (The GW6 method), used to extract useful information from the noise,
seemed to me very appropriate in the context of the uncertainty of ERP occurrence in the EEG
recordings of the receivers.
4. Also, statistical analysis is well designed and properly made, it allowed the exclusion of chance
from investigated phenomenology.
5. The effect size in such experiments is small or very small, being on the border of chance.
Therefore, it would have been appropriate to make a comparison with the effect size obtained in
other experiments of this type.
6. The results are well supported by the experimental data and the processing methods. I think that
the authors provide sufficient data to replicate the experiment without having great difficulties,
which supports the scientific nature of the research.
7. Also, I say that I agree with changes made at the suggestion of one of the referees.
8. For future research I think that generating a baseline obtained from experimental sessions in which
any (no) stimulus will be applied, It would be more appropriate than the method used in this
experiment.
I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that

The manuscript reports a study in which spatially separated pairs of participants have been measured
with EEG simultaneously. One of them was audiovisually stimulated at random times. The hypothesis was
tested whether an evoked response related to the stimulation in one participant could be detected in the
EEG of the non-stimulated participant. A nonparametrical analysis using bootstrapping analysis showed a
positive effect in the alpha frequency range.
The manuscript is written clearly and the experiment and analysis seem to be done in a scientific rigor
way. However, several questions arose and some additions and changes should be done before full
approval of this paper. These are described in the following:
1. This type of experiment was already done and published by various researchers. Almost none of

1. This type of experiment was already done and published by various researchers. Almost none of
them is mentioned but I think this is important as the study is a kind of replication of previous
studies. Especially, as there are experiments that showed an effect in the alpha band which
supports your findings. I would suggest to report previous studies of this type in the introduction
and shortly report their findings (E.g.by Wackermann, Radin, Hinterberger,…).
2. In the introduction the Generalized Quantum Theory is presented as a rational for the hypothesis. I
would be very careful with this approach because it is not clear whether this study design can be
used to test the WQT and further whether the WQT actually applies to the phenomenon of distant
mental interactions even if it is an elegant model. Spoken as a physicist, I do not really see the
conditions for entanglement fulfilled because not every subsystem, that has information of another
subsystem and shares the idea of interconnectedness behaves as being entangled. Therefore, it
seems to be oversimplified to just state that "this relationship constitutes an entangled state".
Another problem arises with the non-signal transfer paradigm which in this type of experiment
would be violated if we would find replicable correlations of the same type. In such case one
should find a different explanation for the effect.
Therefore, I suggest instead of claiming the WQT in the introduction, the study should be
presented as a replication of previous studies in a slightly different manner, testing an experiential
phenomenon reported by many people. Also please state why you were using this type of stimuli.
The WQT would probably fit better as an attempt for an explanation of the findings in the
discussion or, if used in the introduction with much more care.
3. Why were you focusing on the frequency range between 9-10 Hz? Was this a post-hoc selection?
Could you tell the results of the other standard frequencies such as theta, beta,.. bands?
4. “…it becomes possible to calculate the R(x) array in a number of combinations of pairs equal to: Nt
= NC*(NC - 1)/2 = 91. The result can be written using a new array, R(I, X), in which I = 1... 91 and X
= 1... 384 are the calculated values.“
This description remains unclear to me. Could you describe the meaning of the variables and
explain the process a bit more?
5. What is the GW6 method?
6. Is it possible to tell something about the localization of your findings as you recorded 14 channels?
7. In the discussion please compare your findings to those of similar studies.
I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that
it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined
above.

Thank you for your review. Here follows our replies to your comments.
1. ......I would suggest to report previous studies of this type in the introduction and shortly report
their findings (E.g. by Wackermann, Radin, Hinterberger,…).
Reply: In the introduction and in the discussion of version 2, we added this information.
Furthermore we added the list and references of all studies related to this line of
investigation in the Supplementary Material.
2. ....Spoken as a physicist, I do not really see the conditions for entanglement fulfilled because not
every subsystem, that has information of another subsystem and shares the idea of
interconnectedness behaves as being entangled. Therefore, it seems to be oversimplified to just
state that "this relationship constitutes an entangled state".
Reply: We are aware of your knowledge regarding the theory, and as explained by the
GQT authors, this theory is not related to physical observables, but rather is one that can
be applied to every complex system, regardless of whether physical, biological, or mental.
If we assume that every human mind is a complex system, it is safe to assume the
possibility that two minds, a certain distance apart, can be entangled if the intention to be
connected is mutual, as suggested in the instructions to participants. This theory has
already obtained empirical support in the entanglement of a human mind with a random
number generator – considered to be a complex physical system (Walach et al. PLoS in
press).
...Another problem arises with the non-signal transfer paradigm which in this type of experiment
would be violated if we would find replicable correlations of the same type.
Reply: We agree. In the Discussion we clarify that what we observed is a correlation and
not a transmission of signals.
3. Why were you focusing on the frequency range between 9-10 Hz? Was this a post-hoc
selection? Could you tell the results of the other standard frequencies such as theta, beta,.. bands?
Reply: In the Discussion we specifically stated the explorative nature of the study. No
other relevant results were observed in other EEG frequency bands.
4-5. What is the GW6 method?
Reply: As explained in the Data Analysis section, this is an alternative method for
analyzing EEG signals based on the correlation among the signals detected in the EEG
channels (14 in our case), which is more resistant to jitter and interferences compared to
simple classical ERP averaging. The cited and freely available reference (Giroldini et al)
contains a more technical explanation of how it works and how it differs from classical
methods.
6. Is it possible to tell something about the localization of your findings as you recorded 14
channels?
Reply: We did not investigate the “sources” of the observed correlation given that our
primary interest was in extracting it from the noise present in the EEG signals. We agree
that a comparative analysis of the sources of the correlation, for example frontal versus

that a comparative analysis of the sources of the correlation, for example frontal versus
occipital between the senders and the receivers, may give important clues about its
characteristics.
7. In the discussion please compare your findings to those of similar studies.
