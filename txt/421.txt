Purpose/Objective: To investigate the feasibility of brain– computer interface (BCI) with patients on an
inpatient spinal cord injury (SCI) unit. Research Method/Design: This study included 25 participants
aged 18 – 64 who sustained traumatic or nontraumatic SCI and did not have severe cognitive or
psychiatric impairment. Participants completed a variety of screening measures related to cognition,
psychological disposition, pain, and technology experience/interest. The Emotiv electroencephalography
system was used in conjunction with a cube rotation and manipulation game presented on a laptop
computer. Results: The majority of participants successfully completed the BCI game and reported
enjoyment of the experience. Outside of a mild trend of lower performance among participants with a
past or present head injury, there were no demographic variables, injury variables or screening measures
significantly associated with BCI performance. Conclusions/Implications: The BCI paradigm demonstrated feasibility and safety across participant age range, educational and vocational background, and
level of injury. Despite the rapid integration of technology into rehabilitation health care settings, there
are few evidence-based studies regarding the feasibility of technology with specific inpatient populations.
Clinical implications and challenges of using this technology in a rehabilitation setting are discussed.

Impact and Implications
Although brain– computer interface (BCI) technology has been studied for motor and communication
augmentation, there is sparse literature exploring the use and tolerability of this technology with
inpatient spinal cord populations. This study is one of very few attempting to clarify if BCI can be
tolerated during inpatient rehabilitation. This works extends the literature supporting the use of BCI
with spinal cord injury patients even with higher level injury, moderate pain complaints, and
mild–moderate cognitive difficulties. BCI may soon be considered an option to enhance traditional
rehabilitation after spinal cord injury. However, BCI paradigms need to be developed to demonstrate
enhanced treatment effects beyond traditional care.

The myriad electronic and computer assisted device to enhance daily functioning are continually expanding and gaining
increased interest among individuals who have sustained a
spinal cord injury (SCI). Brain– computer interface (BCI) is one

such technology generating great promise to address both motor
and communication barriers (Collinger et al., 2013; Ikegami,
Takano, Saeki, & Kansaku, 2011; Mak & Wolpaw, 2009; Shih,
Krusienski, & Wolpaw, 2012). BCI has been described as
linking brain patterns to motor or mental intent in an effort to

bypass the reliance upon peripheral nerves and muscles that
may be compromised (Cincotti et al., 2008; Millan et al., 2010).
Implications for promoting and/or monitoring neuroplasticity
after central nervous system injury with repeat BCI use have
also been postulated (Burns, Adeli, & Buford, 2014; Dobkin,
2007).
Case examples and a few small studies have highlighted how
BCI can be applied to neurorehabilitation populations such as
stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, locked-in syndrome, and SCI
(Enzinger et al., 2008; Ikegami et al., 2011; Kaufmann, Holz, &
Kubler, 2013; Kiper, Piron, Turolla, Stozek, & Tonin, 2011;
Schreuder et al., 2013). The use of BCI beyond motor and communication augmentation has received less attention despite the
key role psychological factors play in perceived quality of life
following SCI (Tate, Kalpakjian, & Forchheimer, 2002). Recommended avenues of further BCI exploration, which have direct
relevance to SCI treatment targets, include pain management and
psychological adjustment (Dobkin, 2007). These recommended
areas closely align with research priorities voiced by individuals
with SCI when surveyed (Hammell, 2010).
Intriguing findings from animal and human studies support the
role of neuroplasticity and reorganization—particularly of the somatosensory cortex—in pain experience after SCI (Rao et al.,
2013; Tidoni, Tieri, & Aglioti, 2015; Wrigley et al., 2009). The
potential of repetitive BCI training to promote reorganization
warrants additional exploration (Wrigley et al., 2009). BCI can be
coupled with virtual reality (VR), which is appealing given the
more recent development of promising VR paradigms for neuropathic pain and phantom limb pain (Alphonso et al., 2012; Murray,
2009). Studies using BCI for emotional recognition (e.g., participant electroencephalography [EEG] patterns for emotionally laden
audiovisual stimuli) and psychological intervention highlight the
potential for BCI to optimize psychological adjustment following
injury (Dutta et al., 2013; Jatupaiboon, Pan-ngum, & Israsena,
2013). Theoretically, BCI may add an increased perception of
control during pain modifying interventions. BCI could likewise
serve as an adjunct to help interact with virtual environments
already shown to be effective in treatment of anxiety disorders,
which are seen at a higher rate among individuals after SCI
(Motraghi, Seim, Meyer, & Morissette, 2014; Parsons & Rizzo,
2008).
Despite considerable promise, much of BCI technology is not
ready for mainstream implementation and the various challenges
inherent with such interventions—including how physical impairment may compromise BCI performance— have been well detailed (see Danziger, 2014; Hill, Hauser, & Schalk, 2014; Kübler
& Birbaumer, 2008; Mak & Wolpaw, 2009; Millan et al., 2010;
Shih et al., 2012, for more information). In a recent review of the
use of BCI in persons with SCI, Rupp (2014) concluded that while
BCI seems to be a promising assistive technology for individuals
with SCI, systematic investigation is needed to obtain a realistic
understanding of the feasibility of using BCI in a clinical setting.
Rupp identified three potentially limiting factors related to feasibility that should be considered: (a) availability of technology for
signal acquisition and processing, (b) individual differences in user
characteristics, and (c) infrastructure and health care related constraints. Consequently, our exploratory study used an off-the-shelf
BCI technology that is widely available to address Rupp’s initial
concern and additional feasibility questions. Thus, the primary

objective of this study was to assess feasibility of BCI usage including safety, technology suitability (e.g., reliability and usability), user
characteristics (e.g., recruitment rates, age, gender, enjoyment), and
potential health-care-related constraints (e.g., scheduling, participant
tolerance). Secondary objectives included examination of associations
between (a) participant demographic characteristics and BCI performance and (b) cognition, mood, and pain level with BCI performance.
Although the current study is exploratory in nature, we hypothesized
that greater cognitive impairment, higher endorsement of depression,
higher reported pain, and limited familiarity with computers/technology could adversely affect BCI performance.

Method
Participants
Individuals with SCI between the ages of 18 and 64 and deemed
medical stable were potential study candidates. The presence of
significant visual impairment, significant cognitive impairment
(based on multidisciplinary staff input, record review and screening clinician judgment), history of developmental disorders, or
severe and poorly managed psychiatric illnesses precluded involvement in the study. Of 32 consecutive subjects meeting criteria
who were approached, 25 agreed to participate in the study. The
seven who declined to participate either cited no interest/aversion
to technology or feeling too overwhelmed by their rehabilitation
program to enter a research study. Participants were primarily
Caucasian (76%), adult (age 45 ⫾ 13.0), males (76%) who had
vocational or educational achievement beyond high school (90%).
Most had sustained a recent SCI (age at injury 44.5 ⫾ 13.3) with
the median time between injury and study participation of 50 days.
The SCI was most frequently at cervical (48%) or thoracic (44%)
levels and tetraplegia (52%) was common (see Table 1 below for
American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale and injury
details).

Procedure
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board to
ensure all procedures were considered ethical. All new admissions
to the SCI unit were screened by a psychologist. Those patients
who met the study criteria were approached to be part of the study.
For interested patients, a psychologist or research team member
explained the study and completed the consent process. All sub-

sequent contacts occurred in a private location (e.g., private room
or designated hospital meeting room). Participants were either seen
during the course of the rehabilitation therapies, in the late afternoon after therapies, or on the weekends. Depending on the participant’s preference and mobility level, all aspects of the study
were completed in a wheelchair or hospital bed. A more extensive
screening including all measures related to cognition, mood, and
physical status was completed at initial contact. Select measures
were repeated immediately before the BCI paradigm and at the
final contact. The BCI game was displayed on a 12 in. laptop
screen. After the relevant areas on the face and mastoids had been
cleaned, the Emotiv EEG headset (see Figure 1) was positioned on
the participant’s head. The examiner verified impedances in connections between each electrode and the participant’s scalp.

Measures
Participants completed a demographic questionnaire along with
specific measures of cognition, mood, and physical status collected
solely for the purpose of this study. Initially, individuals completed
a brief cognitive screening to assess (a) current attention and
processing speed abilities and (b) premorbid cognitive functioning.
Attention and processing speed were measured using the Digit
Span and Letter-Number Sequencing subtests of the Wechsler
Adult Intelligence Scale–Third Edition (Wechsler, 1997) and the
Oral Trail Making Test (Ricker, Houtler, & Axelrod, 1996). A
single word reading test, the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading
(Wechsler, 2001), was used to help estimate premorbid cognitive functioning. Mood was assessed using the Patient Health
Questionnaire-9 (Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001) and the
State Mood Measure from the Profile of Mood States (McNair,
Lorr, & Droppleman, 1971). The Pain Disability Index of the
McGill Pain Questionnaire (Melzack, 1987) was used to assess
perceived disability due to pain and average daily pain across
contact points. The participants were also informally asked about

437

pain during the BCI training to provide additional information
about any discomfort in real time. The participant’s ability to
become mentally absorbed in everyday activities was measured
with the Tellegen Absorption Scale (Tellegen & Atkinson, 1974).
Finally, semistructured qualitative questions developed specifically for this study inquired about participants’ prior recreation
activities, prior video game experience/interest, and a subjective
measure of the gaming experience within this study.

Apparatus
A BCI was used for acquiring brain-based information (e.g., via
EEG-based device with scalp electrodes) that allowed for extraction of target information and identification of patterns linked to
intent. This required analysis of signals by a system that aims to
minimize nonessential physiological responses, movements and
background noise (Lin et al., 2010). It is essential that the BCI
system provides the user real time feedback and be flexible enough
to meet the needs of its user (Mak & Wolpaw, 2009). One such
device is the Emotiv EPOC headset, an inexpensive consumergrade device, which was initially developed for the gaming industry but has recently seen use in various research studies (Andujar,
Ekandem, Alvarez, James, & Gilbert, 2011; Badcock et al., 2013;
Dutta et al., 2013; Inventado, Legaspi, Suarez, & Numao, 2011;
McMahan, Parberry, & Parsons, 2015a, 2015b; Pham & Tran,
2012). The Emotiv EPOC is a compact, wireless headset that
requires comparatively little effort to set up and allows much
greater flexibility and mobility than traditional EEG. The EPOC
was aimed at the gaming market, and is not classified as a
medical device, though several researchers have since adopted
it for a variety of applications (Cinar & Sahin, 2013; Rosas-Cholula,
Ramírez-Cortes, Martinez-Carballido, Alarcón-Aquino, & GomezGil, 2010; Vi & Subramanian, 2012). Using the EPOC, researchers
can detect facial movements, emotional states, and imagined motor
movement.

This Emotiv EEG headset has 14 electrodes (saline sensors)
locating at AF3, AF4, F3, F4, F7, F8, FC5, FC6, P7, P8, T7, T8,
O1, O2 (see Figure 1) and two additional sensors that serve as
Common Mode Sense (CMS)/Driven Right Leg (DRL) reference
channels (one for the left and the other for the right hemisphere of
the head). The Emotiv EEG’s 14 data channels are spatially
organized using the International 10 –20 system. The Emotiv
EPOC headset does not require a moistened cap to improve conduction. The sampling rate is 128 Hz, the bandwidth is 0.2– 45 Hz,
and the digital notch filters are at 50 Hz and 60 Hz. The device
yields less sophisticated EEG data than cost prohibitive traditional
medical devices (Duvinage et al., 2013), but the ease of use and
portability make it a preferred system within a hospital setting.
Data transfer occurs wirelessly to a Windows based laptop via
Bluetooth and USB dongle.

Description of BCI Paradigm
This study utilized a cube rotation game which begins with the
participant initially being instructed to relax to create a “neutral
condition” with no cube movement. Training progresses with an
emphasis on imagining pushing or rolling the cube in a consistent
fashion. Reminders to minimize facial or bodily movement are
used as needed to minimize interference with the BCI analysis
program. Following a training session for each movement (i.e.,
push, left, right, and cube disappearance), participants performed
three trials, lasting 8 s each, focused on moving the cube in the
trained direction. This paradigm was chosen due to the brevity and
graduated complexity of the task in hopes that determining factors
related to successful BCI completion could be explored. The task
does require basic cognitive functions, such as attention to the
visual stimuli and comprehension of directions, but was not considered to be heavily dependent on cognitive abilities or prior
experience with computer interfaces.

Data Analysis
Participant characteristics along with measures developed for
this study to understand computer use, interest in the study, competency ratings, and enjoyment of the BCI were summarized with
means and standard deviations, medians, or counts and percentages. Means and standard deviations were used for the BCI trial
results. To determine if participants’ cognitive testing scores were
associated with BCI gaming results, Spearman and Pearson correlations were used, as appropriate. Comparison of patients with
less than 10 completed trials versus 10 or more trials was performed with Wilcoxon’s rank sum tests for quantitative variables,
and Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables.

Results
The data speak encouragingly to the feasibility focus of the
study. Participants across varying severities of SCI completed the
BCI without adverse effects. Specifically, questions about headaches, nausea, vertigo, discomfort and other potential complication
were queried. On three occasions, the BCI trial was rescheduled
prior to onset due to participant complaints of intrusive pain or
significant fatigue related to rehabilitation therapies. The participants were quite receptive to the BCI activity and the majority

reported enjoying the experience (79.2 ⫾ 23.9 on 1–100 scale with
100 indicating maximal enjoyment). Despite approximately half
the participants indicating little to no experience with computers,
participants generally felt competent during the BCI game (69.1 ⫾
28.4 on 1–100 scale with 100 indicating maximal competency).
Furthermore, the collective data (see Table 2 below) support that
participants were more successful than they perceived with the
caveat that two participants did not have any successful trials.
A review of participant characteristics revealed no relationship
between BCI performance and age, demographic variables, educational achievement, or vocation. Individuals who rated their
computer competency higher at pretesting were slightly quicker to
create movement across trials (r ⫽ .45, p ⫽ .032), yet the number
of successful trials, average time to reach maximum movement,
and mean power level accomplished were not significantly related
to prior computer use or skill level (p ⬎ .05).
The inclusion of cognitive testing, screening of psychiatric
distress and self-reported pain was based on the premise that such
factors may impact BCI performance. Cognitive test scores were
not generally correlated with BCI performance (see Table 3) and
were quite similar across those who completed less than 10 trials
versus those who completed 10 –12 trials (see Table 4). There were
also no significant relationships between cognitive testing outcomes and individual BCI tasks performance (i.e., push, left, right,
and cube disappearance). Mood ratings were not significantly
related to BCI performance. Furthermore, pain ratings were generally stable across the three contacts and higher pain ratings were
actually correlated with better BCI performance (r ⫽ .77, p ⱕ
.001).
A review of the demographics, injury related information, and
test data did not reveal any specific trends for the two outliers
unable to complete any trials. The possibility of technology failure
could not be ruled out for these cases. Of the seven participants
who completed less than 10 of the 12 trials, five had a history of
head injury. In contrast, only two of the 18 participants completing
10 or more trials had such a history. Analysis of specific cognitive
test measures did not show significant differences in scores among
those who did versus did not report a head injury. This finding
must be interpreted in light of the screening criteria which excluded individuals with moderate to severe deficits from recent
head injury/medical complications or severe persistent deficits
from remote events.

Discussion
This study adds to the cautious enthusiasm regarding the use of
BCI technology with clinical populations. Our participants generTable 2

ally enjoyed the experience and verbalized interest in additional
experiences with BCI. Furthermore, rating scales did not suggest
any physical discomfort, stress or other negative effects during the
BCI experience.
Analysis of cognitive testing along with various psychological,
physical and other screening inventories increases the confidence
that this technology can be safely used in medical populations.
Specifically, preliminary concerns about intrusive psychological
distress related to a recent injury, poorly controlled pain levels, or
BCI malfunction with participants who were unable to leave a
hospital bed affecting BCI performance were not borne out. The
participants who performed best on the BCI paradigm demonstrated no specific cognitive strengths or premorbid proclivity for
easily manipulating a virtual environment, yet easily learned the

paradigms. The trend of lower BCI performance among individuals with prior traumatic brain injury warrants further exploration to
clarify how such technology could be used and, if needed, modified for this population. Still, future studies should not hesitate to
include individuals with SCI who have mild to moderate cognitive
difficulties, pain, or mild or moderate psychiatric distress. Additionally, a prior recreational history of video games/computer
related activities does not appear to be a prerequisite for enjoyment
and proficiency with BCI technology.
The encouraging results raise the possibility of trialing BCI with
clinically related virtual paradigms to address persistent post-SCI
problems such as pain and psychological distress. For example, a
paradigm that focused on mindfulness or relaxation could be used
to treat pain to augment traditional face-to-face interventions,
which have shown minimal impact in the literature (Felix, 2014;
Finnerup, 2013). VR paradigms currently exist for these target
problems (Alphonso et al., 2012; Motraghi et al., 2014; Parsons &
Rizzo, 2008) and the addition of BCI VR paradigms as previously
discussed would be a natural progression to understand the true
utility of this technology for clinical care. The introduction of BCI
technology during the inpatient rehabilitation process remains
highly appealing. This is often a window of the recovery process
when patients have optimal motivation, excellent support from
medical professionals, and time to experiment with new treatments. The ability to pilot and modify potential BCI paradigms
would prove helpful for the clinician. The patient’s exposure and
familiarity would also hypothetically increase application to real
world settings if this technology becomes a portable clinical tool
extended to the home setting. Although no adverse effects occurred in the current study, the hospital setting was an optimal
environment to pilot this technology in a patient population at risk
for acute medical issues.
A few key concerns warrant discussion. The choice of a very
short and basic paradigm was based on the exploratory nature of
this study. Given the primary focus on feasibility and safety, there
is no comparison data for this BCI paradigm modified for this
study. Our study consisted of only three contact points including
only one BCI exposure. A more involved study with repeated BCI
use involving a more complex paradigm is needed to explore any

adverse effects from prolonged and repeated BCI sessions. Furthermore, understanding participant strategies to increase mastery
of more involved BCI exercises will be helpful in creating clinically relevant virtual environments which would undoubtedly be
more elaborate and time intensive.
Even with this brief BCI paradigm, there were challenges with
implementation due to the busy inpatient setting. The use of noise
cancellation devices outside of the hospital room and doing BCI
after typical therapy hours are worthy of consideration given the
need to minimize distractions. Individual variables such as fatigue,
pain, and medication effects may have likewise affected participant preference of morning or afternoon participation sessions,
suggesting the need for flexible scheduling if possible.
While there are no comparison rates of recruitment, the consensus was that the BCI was well received by inpatients who often
verbalized enthusiasm to trial the device. Those who declined
tended to be females (five of seven) above 40 years of age. When
queried, these potential subjects primarily verbalized limited interest in the technology. Future studies should further explore
whether gender, age, and cultural factors are related to openness to
using BCI.
Overall, there were minimal complications related to technology
malfunction. On a few occasions, headset or sensor malfunctions
prohibited running subjects. Considering the reasonable price of
the technology, having multiple units would be preferable. This
would also eliminate delays related to recharging the battery.
Training for the administration of the paradigm was not time
intensive and did not require extensive computer or medical technology expertise. As such, with more clinically relevant paradigms, it would be preferable to have a certified rehabilitation
professional conduct the intervention. Our research group also had
the advantage of access to multiple information technology specialists to address any headset or program complications. This
luxury, which may not be available in most locations, minimized
potential interruptions in patient care during the current study.
Ultimately, the utility and adoption of BCI in rehabilitation
settings will be dependent upon more sophisticated programs that
target measurable clinical goals. Future studies will then need to
determine if BCI and advanced technologies show treatment gains
as compared to traditional interventions. The potential for BCI
remains intriguing yet much work needs to be done before this
modality can be considered as a viable adjunct to current rehabilitation programs. The current study provides preliminary but essential support for the feasibility and safety of this technology in
the inpatient setting.
