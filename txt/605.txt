ABSTRACT
Asymmetry of Gains and Losses: Behavioral and Electrophysiological Measures
Diego Gonzalo Flores Garnica
Department of Psychology, BYU
Doctor of Philosophy
The purpose of this research was to explore the effects of small monetary or economic gains
and/or losses on choice behavior through the use of a computerized game, and to determine
gain/loss ratio differences using both behavioral and electrophysiological measures. Participants
(N=53) played the game in several 36 minute sessions. These sessions operated with concurrent
variable-interval schedules for both rewards and penalties. Previously, asymmetrical effects of
gains and losses have been identified through cognitive studies, primarily due to the work of
nobel laureates Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (1979). They found that the effect of a loss
is twice (i.e., 2:1) that of a gain. Similar results have been observed in the behavioral laboratory
as exemplified by the research of Rasmussen and Newland (2008), who found a 3:1 ratio for the
effect of losses versus gains. The asymmetry of gains and losses was estimated behaviorally and
through event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and the cognitive (Kahneman and Tversky) and
behavioral (Rasmussen and Newland) discrepancy elucidated.
In the game, the player moves an animated submarine around sea rocks to collect yellow coins
and other treasures on the sea floor. Upon collecting a coin, one of three things can happen: The
player triggers a penalty (loss), the player triggers a payoff (gain), or there is no change. The
behavioral measures consisted in counting the number of clicks, reinforces, and punishers and
then determining ratio differences between punished (loss) and no punished condition (gain)
conditions. The obtained gain/loss ratio corresponded to an asymmetry of 2:1. Similarly ratio
differences were found between male and female, virtual money and cash, risk averse versus risk
seeking, and generosity versus profit behavior. Also, no ratio difference was found when players
receive information about other player’s performances in the game (players with information
versus players without information). In electroencephalographic (EEG) studies, visual evoked
potentials (VEPs) and ERPs components (e.g., P300) were examined. I found increased ERP
amplitudes for the losses in relation to the gains that corresponded to the calculated behavioral
asymmetry of 2:1. A correlational strategy was adopted that sought to identify neural correlates
of choice consistent with cognitive and behavioral approaches. In addition, electro cortical ratio
differences were observed between different sets of electrodes that corresponded to the front,
middle, and back sections of the brain; differences between sessions, risk averse and risk seeking
behavior and sessions with concurrent visual and auditory stimuli and only visual were also
estimated.

CHAPTER 1: Introduction
In Plato’s Protagoras (1967), the main argument between the elderly Protagoras, a
celebrated Sophist, and Socrates is about measurement. Aware that Protagoras has argued that
"man is the measure of all things", Socrates suggests a new object of measurement:
. . . Like a practiced weigher, put pleasant things and painful in the scales, and with them
the nearness and the remoteness, and tell me which count for more. For if you weigh
pleasant things against pleasant, the greater and the more are always to be preferred: if
painful against painful, then always the fewer and smaller. If you weigh pleasant against
painful, and find that the painful are outbalanced by the pleasant—whether the nearby
the remote or the remote by the near—you must take that course of action to which the
pleasant are attached. (Plato, 1967, p. 356b)
How pleasure and pain govern human behavior has long been of interest to philosophers,
economists, psychologists, and many others. Rene Descartes (1596 – 1650), in his Treatise of
Man (1662), argued that behavior is reflexive but that humans also possess a soul capable of
logical reasoning. The soul interacts with the body and can dominate the reflexes. The mind’s
content arises, in part, from sensory experiences. However, he also held that some ideas were
innate and existed in all humans independent of personal experience. For John Locke (16321704), all the ideas people have are directly the consequence of experience after birth. Thomas
Hobbes (1588-1679) agreed with Descartes’s dualism, but, unlike Descartes, believed that the
mind operates just as predictably as a reflex. Hobbes proposed that voluntary behavior is
governed by the principle of hedonism, that is, a human’s sole intrinsic good is the overall
pursuit of pleasure. In short, a hedonist strives to maximize net pleasure by minimizing pain.

2
Utility theory, which is a cornerstone of the rational perspective of economics, is rooted in the
hedonist principle.
On the other hand, a fundamental corollary to the principle, according to Kahneman and
Tversky (1991), is that the pain associated with giving up a good is greater that the pleasure
associated with obtaining it. The asymmetrical relationship between gains and losses results in
what is commonly known as risk aversion and contradicts the utility theory of choice.
Utility Theory and Rational Choice
In Nudge, Thaler and Sunstein (2009) differentiated “Econs” from “Humans.” The
former are rational decision makers. For many economists, rational agents (Econs) are first and
foremost self-interested; they are able to compare potential outcomes and select those that
maximize one’s benefits and minimize one’s costs. The rational decision-maker has orderly
preferences, that is, when faced with a choice, she or he gauges each alternative’s “subjective
utility” and chooses the alternative with the highest. LeBoeuf and Shafir (2005) stated that
“Deciding, then, is simply a matter of choosing the option with the greatest expected utility”
(LeBoeuf & Shafir, 2005, p. 243). Utility theory holds that behavior is normatively rational and
adaptive. In contrast to Econs, Humans are ordinary people who operate by rules of thumb or
heuristics that often lead them amiss. They are too prone to generalization, are biased in favor of
the status quo, and are more concerned to avoid loss than to achieve gains, among other
shortcomings. Kahneman (2011) has pointed out that economists adopted expected utility theory
as a dualism: “as a logic that prescribes how decisions should be made, and as a description of
how Econs make choices” (p. 270).
In contrast, although “economists assume that behavior is rational. . . operant
psychologists assume that it is the product of habit determined by particular schedules of

3
reinforcement” (Lea, 1987, p. 99). Moreover, cognitivists and behaviorists have shown that
“losses loom larger than gains” (D. Kahneman & Tversky, 1979; Rasmussen & Newland, 2008),
meaning that the aversion to a loss of a certain magnitude is greater than the attraction to a gain
of the same magnitude. Consistent with this finding, studies of emotion have shown that
affective responses are faster and stronger to proximate negative events than to positive ones
(Gehring & Willoughby, 2002).
Utility theory has been criticized on the basis of the repeated observation of violations of
the most fundamental requirement of consistency. After reviewing the violations, Kahneman and
Tversky (2000) concluded that descriptive accounts of choice outcomes can lead to different but
equally robust, elegant, and comprehensive principles of human decision making. These
empirically derived principles emphasize the weaknesses and limitations of utility theory, but, as
Kahneman and Tversky concluded, they are not yet sufficient to challenge utility theory as a
normative theory of decision making. Similarly, Herrnstein (1990) concluded that “the theory of
rational choice fails as a description of actual behavior, but it remains unequaled as a normative
theory. It tells us how we should behave in order to maximize reinforcement, not how we do
behave…..” (p. 356).
Alternative Views of the Asymmetry of Gains and Losses
Cognitivists, behaviorists, and, more recently, neuroscientists have argued in favor of an
asymmetry between the effects of gains and losses (Fox & Poldrack, 2009b). Such asymmetry is
an indication that humans are sometimes biased in their decision making and do not always
maximize outcomes as utility theory suggests.

4
The Asymmetry of Gains and Losses: A Cognitive Perspective
In their SEinal article on prospect theory, Kahneman and Tversky (1979) identified several
violations of utility theory. First, they defined choices as adjustments to current utility from a
personal reference point and explained that most people prefer the sure gain over a risky prospect
of an expected value. This preference is called risk aversion. Second, decision makers tend to
underweigh low-probability events and overweigh high-probability ones. Finally, the manner in
which alternatives are presented can influence the choices made.
Additionally, some individuals prefer a risky gamble over a certain loss. This preference
is called risk seeking. “With the exception of prospects that involve very small probabilities, risk
aversion is generally observed in choices involving gains, whereas risk seeking tends to hold in
choices involving losses” (LeBoeuf & Shafir, 2005, p. 245). For Tversky and Kahneman (2000),
“the asymmetry of pain and pleasure is the ultimate justification of loss aversion in choice” (p.
157).
Kahneman and Tversky (1979) also argued that individuals make decisions based on the
potential value of losses and gains rather than on an aggregate outcome and that individuals
evaluate these losses and gains using certain heuristics. And they pointed out that “Our
perceptual apparatus is attuned to the evaluation of changes or differences rather than to the
evaluation of absolute magnitudes” (Kahneman & Tversky, 2000, p. 32). Specifically, . . . the
value function is (i) defined on deviation from the reference point; (ii) generally concave for
gains and commonly convex for losses, [and] (iii) steeper for losses than for gains” (p. 34). Other
essential features of prospect theory are that “values are attached to changes rather than to final
states, and that decision weights do not coincide with stated probabilities” (D. Kahneman &
Tversky, 2000, p. 31).

5
It is important to note that prospect theory coincides with the behavior-analytic concept
of melioration. In reference to the matching law (also known as the law of relative effect),
Herrnstein (Rachlin & Laibson, 1997b) noted a question that had not been answered, namely,
“Is there a process that guarantees matching at equilibrium, a dynamic process that does for
matching theory what maximizing does for maximization theory?” (p. 75). Just as utility
theorists believe that choices at equilibrium always maximize utility, within specified
constraints, Herrnstein and Vaughn (1980) proposed that behavior allocates toward higher local
rates of reinforcement. This process is called melioration and differs from maximization in
requiring the organism to respond only to the difference between local reinforcement rates from
individual behaviors (Rachlin & Laibson, 1997b) rather than to overall, aggregated rates. Unlike
maximization, which, for Rachlin and Laibson (1997) “requires the selection of the biggest
aggregation of reinforcement across behaviors” (Rachlin & Laibson, 1997a, pp. 75-76),
melioration is a dynamic process in which a difference between local rates of reinforcers leads to
continuous change in the distribution of behavior so as to achieve an equality of local reinforcer
rates. Sometimes melioration maximizes the overall rate of reinforcement; more often, it
produces a lower-than-maximal reinforcer rate (Davison & McCarthy, 1988).
By contrast, Tversky and Kahneman (2000) reported that people evaluate the outcomes
of risky prospects according to a value function that has three essential operating characteristics
or cognitive features: reference dependence, diminishing sensitivity, and loss aversion.
According to the concept of reference dependence, the carriers of value are gains and losses
defined relative to a reference point. Kahneman (2011) stated that prospect theory is more
complex than utility theory and explained that “. . . In Bernoulli’s theory you need to know only
the state of wealth to determine its utility, but in prospect theory you need to know the reference

6
state” (p. 281). For Kahneman, outcomes that are better than the reference point constitute gains
and outcomes below the reference points constitute losses. (Ariely, Huber, & Wertenbroch,
2005) speculated that “. . . the concept of losses looming larger than gains might not have had
such a deep impact on psychology and economics, because researchers have long postulated
diminishing returns over the full range of most utility functions” (p. 134).
Diminishing sensitivity is the property of decision making that accounts for changes in a
variable having less impact the farther the variable is from the reference point. Kahneman (2011)
also stated that “. . . diminishing sensitivity continues to favor risk aversion for gains and risk
seeking for losses, but the overweighting of low probabilities overcomes this effect and produces
the observed pattern of gambling for gains and caution for losses” (p. 318). On this view,
probabilities are not treated linearly; instead people tend to overweight small probabilities and to
underweight large ones.
It is widely known that, given two options, people compare the outcomes of their chosen
option versus the alternative they could have selected. Economists define the gap between the
two as the “cost of opportunity”. Comparison can be instructive, especially when the difference
is unfavorable. This may result in “regret” of, given a favorable difference, in “rejoicing”.
However, feelings of regret are typically stronger than feelings of rejoicing (Fox & Poldrack,
2009a).
Tversky and Kahneman (2000) maintained that “. . . an immediate consequence of loss
aversion is that the loss of utility associated with giving up a valued good is greater than the
utility gain associated with receiving it” (p. 145). This phenomenon is known as the instant
endowment or the endowment effect. Another phenomenon associated with loss aversion is the
status quo bias, namely, that individuals favor the retention of the status quo over other options

7
because the value of giving up a good is considered greater than the gain produced by a newly
received good. Several studies have shown that the reluctance to sell a good that one owns is
substantially greater than the reluctance to buy a good. Specifically, Kahneman, Knetsch, and
Thaler (2000) reported that a loss is two times more punishing than a gain is rewarding:
. . . These observations, and many others, can be explained by a notion of loss aversion.
A central conclusion of the study of risky choice has been that such choices are best
explained by assuming that the significant carriers of utility are not states of wealth or
welfare, but changes relative to a neutral reference point. Another central result is that
changes that make things worse (losses) loom larger than improvements or gains. The
choice data imply an abrupt change of the slope of the value function at the origin. The
existing evidence suggests that the ratio of the slopes of the value function in two
domains, for small or moderate gains and losses of money, is about 2:1 (p. 199).
The Asymmetry of Gains and Losses: A Behavioral Perspective
The basic principle of reinforcement was formulated by Thorndike (Thorndike, 1911) as
the law of effect, which states that actions that are followed by feelings of satisfaction are more
likely to be repeated, but actions that are followed by feelings of annoyance are not. Ferster and
Skinner (1957) began systematic work on behavioral choice involving schedules of
reinforcement, and it was most extensively studied by Herrnstein (Herrnstein, 1961; Rachlin &
Laibson, 1997a). In the basic procedure, the subject (typically, a food-deprived pigeon) was
exposed to two or more possible response alternatives, each with its own reinforcement schedule.
Studies using this or similar methods consistently have yielded similar results across a variety of
species and reinforcer types: The proportion of responses to an alternative matches the
proportion of reinforcers received for responding to that alternative. If twice as many reinforcers

8
are provided for one alternative, then, on average, twice as many responses are made to that
alternative.
Herrnstein summarized utility theory in this way:
. . . Behavior is depicted as seeking an equilibrium that maximizes something–be it total
subjective utility, hedonic value, reinforcement, energy intake, or reproductive fitness–
within limitations of memory and discriminative acuity as well as the limitations imposed
by the environment. Each mixture of behaviors and their outcomes is viewed as a unique
bundle, and the organism is supposed to select the best bundle, on whatever is the
relevant dimension. Equilibrium is reached with a distribution of activities that cannot be
detectably improved upon by a redistribution of choices; that is, the obtained outcomes
are maximized. (Rachlin & Laibson, 1997a).
By contrast, according to the matching law, the equilibrium is defined as equality
between the ratio of the frequencies of any two behaviors, B1 and B2 that matches their obtained
reinforcers, R1 and R2, as follows:
B1/B2 = R1/R2

(1)

The generalized matching relation (Baum, 1974) is:
(2)

B1/B2 = k (B1/B2) c

In logarithmic form, it is:
Log (B1/B2) = log k + c log (R1/R2)

(3)

where the two free parameters, log k and c, describe bias and sensitivity, respectively.
Rasmussen and Newland (2008) found that there was a substantial bias towards an unpunished
alternative in their participants. They also pointed out that direct comparisons of the relative

9
effects of reinforcers and punishers on behavior are difficult to make because they are
qualitatively different stimuli, and thus absolute measurement becomes problematic. In order to
solve this dilemma, they standardized the reinforcer-punisher differential by using a system of
points that translated into monetary gains and monetary losses. Because money can be used as a
punisher (monetary loss, which is a form of negative punishment) and also as a reinforcer
(monetary gain), they addressed the question of whether one cent lost was equivalent to one cent
gained in terms of its relative effect on behavior. On the basis of their experimental findings,
they concluded that:
. . . When humans are offered a choice between two response alternatives, the allocation
of behavior is captured well by the generalized matching relation, and sensitivity to
reinforcer ratios resembles that seen in other studies with human and non-human species.
Punishing one alternative reduces the sensitivity of behavior to reinforcer ratios
and produces a significant bias toward the unpunished alternative, even when the two
alternatives deliver the same net reinforcer amount. In fact, when monetary gain is the
same on the alternatives, it appears that losing a penny is three times more punishing than
earning the same penny is reinforcing. (Rasmussen & Newland, 2008, p. 65)
The Asymmetry of Gains and Losses: An Electrophysiological Perspective
Kahneman (2011) noted that “the brain’s response to variations of probabilities is
strikingly similar to the decision weights estimated from choices” (p. 315). Studies using
electrophysiological methods, specifically, the electroencephalogram (EEG), allow for the
recording of scalp visual evoked potentials (VEP) and event-related potentials (ERPs) (Chiappa,
1997; Luck, 2005). The term VEP refer to electrical potentials, initiated by brief visual stimuli,
which are recorded from the scalp overlying visual cortex. The P300 wave form is a VEP wave

10
form that has six components that are the focus of interest in this study: N50, P100, N100, P200,
N200, and P300. The P300 component is the main focus of the analysis. The P200, N200, and
P300 are specifically ERP’s, however, the term ERP will be used to refer all the VEP
components.
ERPs are recordings of the brain’s activity linked to the occurrence of an event, such as
the presentation of a stimulus, and they can a temporal record of brain events. ERP researchers
have shown that the human brain responds differentially to positive and negative outcomes
within a few-hundred milliseconds of their incidence following both self-identified errors and
automated error feedback (Goyer, Woldorff, & Huettel, 2008). The EEG is an ongoing measure
of electrical activity on the scalp relative to a reference point. By contrast, ERPs are more
discrete and have distinct waveforms that may be correlated with specific cognitive activities
(Bernat, Nelson, Steele, Gehring, & Patrick, 2011). An ERP waveform consists of a sequence of
positive and negative deflections known as peaks. The labels N50, P100, N100, P200, N200, and
P300 are commonly used, where P and N indicate positive or negative deflections, respectively,
and the number indicates an ordinal position in the waveform.
P100 peak is associated with selective attention, and is an obligatory sensory response
that is elicited by visual stimuli reaching the visual cortex. The P100 is linked to variation in
stimulus parameters: contrast, spatial frequency direction, subject state of arousal. The N100 is
linked to spatial attention, occurs when an individual is presented with an item from that of the
prevailing contexts and is larger for discrimination than detection. The P100 and N100 are VEPs
that occur regardless of the task as long as the subject is attentive with eyes open. The P200 is
larger for targeted and infrequent, simple stimuli. The N200 is typically evoked before a motor
response, suggesting its link to the cognitive processes of stimulus identification and distinction

11
and the P300 is elicited in the process of decision making. The P200, N200 and P300 are eventrelated potentials and are dependent upon the task. Ahead the N200 and P300 that are wellknown links to cognition and decision making are described with additional detail.
N200. The N200 which is evoked around 180 to 325 msec following the presentation of a
stimulus is typically evoked before a motor response, suggesting its link to the cognitive
processes of stimulus labeling and distinction. Though there have been some inconsistent
findings about N200 in auditory and visual modalities, N200 seems to reflect cognitive processes
beyond the detection of stimulus mismatch or attention, such as monitoring, and regulation,
feedback of information (Folstein & Petten, 2008). The N200 has been classified in three
components: The N2a is known to reflect the automatic processing of the disparity between a
mismatched stimulus and a sensory memory and reflect automatic change detection mechanisms
based on memory traces, On the other hand, N2b and N2c are elicited only when attention is
required. Specifically, N2b is assumed to reflect the detection of a stimulus mismatch, whereas,
N2c is thought to reflect a subprocess of classification tasks (Folstein & Petten, 2008).
P300. The P300 wave has been defined as the maximum positive deflection occurring
between 250 msec and 500 msec (although its latency can vary depending on stimulus modality,
task conditions, subject age, etc.). The P300 component is measured by assessing its amplitude
and latency. Amplitude (μV) is defined as the difference between the mean pre-stimulus baseline
voltage and the largest positive-going peak of the ERP waveform within a time window. Latency
(msec) is defined as the time from stimulus onset to the point of maximum positive amplitude
within a time window (Polich, 2007). The P300 wave may only occur when the stimulus that is
presented has meaning for the subject. Its occurrence depends entirely on the task performed by
the subject, and it is not directly influenced by the physical properties of the eliciting stimulus.

12
For these reasons it has been considered an endogenous signal, dependent on internal rather than
external factors. Typically, the P300 occurs when the individual needs to pay attention to the
rarer of two events, even if that event is the absence of sensory stimulation. The amplitude is
larger when subjects devote more effort to a task and smaller when the stimulus (target or nontarget) is ambiguous. Any manipulation that postpones stimulus categorization increases P300
latency. Young and Sanfey (2004) found that the P300 in reward studies can be influenced by a
wide variety of factors, including the magnitude of the chosen option, the valence and magnitude
of the alternative option, and the relative value of the alternative outcome in comparison with the
chosen outcome.
Gain/Loss ratio. The behavioral measurement of the gain/loss ratio relates to the ratio of
the unpunished by the punished condition. Generally the values of the means (intercepts) of the
unpunished condition, which corresponds to the gains, are higher in value than the intercepts of
the punished condition which corresponds to losses. Thus, in the behavioral analysis the
procedure followed to calculate the ratio that it has been identified as gain/loss ratio is to divide
the unpunished by the punished condition. However, in the electrophysiological study the
amplitudes of the losses are generally higher than the amplitudes of the gains and the ratio
calculation is loss divided by gain (loss/gain). In order to keep consistency with the behavioral
study, the ratio will continue being identified as the Gain/Loss ratio.
The Experiments
In addition to measuring the asymmetry of gains and losses using behavior-analytic
methods, experiments were designed to examine the effects of gender, risk, altruism, and

13
information, and the use of on-screen points or actual cash, in decision making that involve gains
and losses.
Risk
As already discussed, loss aversion is encapsulated in the expression “losses loom larger
than gains” (D. Kahneman & Tversky, 1979, p. 269) Because people are more willing to take
risks to avoid a loss, loss aversion can explain differences in risk-seeking versus risk aversion.
Until recently, researchers have not focused on the role of emotions like risk tolerance as a
separate factor in the decision process.
Risk tolerance influences a wide decisions and can affect the mode of engagement in an
activity where the outcome is uncertain. An example of risk tolerance was provided by one of the
scientists who developed the Saturn 5 rocket that launched the first Apollo mission to the moon:
. . . You want a valve that doesn’t leak and you try everything possible to develop one.
But the real world provides you with a leaky valve. You have to determine how much
leaking you can tolerate. (Bernstein, 1996, p. 2)
Some individuals tolerate greater losses than other people do. A survey instrument
(questionnaire) was used to measure participants’ risk tolerance and to categorize them into two
groups: risk averse and risk seeking.
Payoffs
A finding that is typically referred as the credit card premium propose that the use of a
credit card as a payment mechanism increases the propensity to spend as compared to cash in
otherwise identical purchase situations. “Thus, prior research seems to suggest that cash

14
payments as opposed to payments with other formats elicit maximum pain of payment”.
(Chatterjee & Rose, 2012, p. 1129). The credit card premium suggest that the payment
mechanism can have effects on the asymmetry of gains and losses.
The Experimental Series
Two sets of experiments were conducted. The first was a series of experiments that
involved only behavior-analytic methods and measures and included experiments 1 to 3.
Experiment 4 was also a behavior-analytic study and will be discussed separately in chapter 4.
The experiment series involving behavior-analytic and electrophysiological measures will be
discussed in chapter 5. I used the initials BEH for the behavioral measures only and EEG for the
behavioral and electrophysiological measures.
Experiment 1. Twenty-six participants (male: M = 22) completed eight sessions. Only
data sessions 4 to 6 were used in the analysis -the data of the first three sessions was not included
considering behavioral stability. The last two sessions (7 and 8) were included in experiment 2.
The experiment had three main objectives: (a) to compute the gain/loss ratio, (b) to examine the
asymmetry of gains and losses as a function of gender, and (c) to examine the asymmetry as a
function of risk.
Hypothesis BEH1: Participants were expected to be more sensitive to losses than to
gains and to exhibit an asymmetry ratio between 2 and 3, consistent with the earlier findings of
Kahneman and Tversky (1979) and Rasmussen and Newland (2008).
Hypothesis BEH2: Gender differences in the asymmetry ratio were expected, with a
higher ratio for women than for men.

15
Hypothesis BEH3: On the basis of results from a risk questionnaire, participants were
categorized as risk averse or risk seeking. A higher asymmetry ratio was expected for the riskaverse participants.
Experiment 2. Twenty-four of the previous 26 participants completed two additional
sessions (sessions 7 and 8). They differed from the previous sessions in that the participants
collected or deposited the gains and losses, respectively, using a coin dispenser/collector.
Hypothesis BEH4. Participants were expected to show increased loss aversion when
playing the game using virtual points + coin dispenser compared to virtual points only.
Experiment 3. In this experiment, 11 new participants were recruited. Unlike
experiments 1 and 2, they were informed about the amounts of money that the other participants
earned during each session.
Hypothesis BEH5. It was expected that the addition of competition in the form of
information about the other players’ gains and losses would result in higher asymmetry ratios.
Risk aversion and risk seeking was also explored in the context of competition.
Experiment 4. The classical economic view of individual decision making emphasizes
rationality and selfishness. Ten new participants (age median=22), distinct from previous
experiments, were recruited. This experiment was designed to include two groups of participants
who were identified as the Profit group and the Charity group, respectively. The first phase of the
experiment included four sessions (1-4). Participants in the Profit group were paid directly
according to their performance. Those in the Charity group donated their profits to a non-profit
organization of their choice. Phase 2 included sessions 5 through 10. In the odd-numbered

16
sessions, all participants were paid directly according to their performance. In the evennumbered sessions, their earnings were donated to charity.
Hypothesis BEH6. Higher asymmetry ratios were expected from participants when they
profited personally than when they made donations to charity.
Experiment 5. Sixteen (male: M = 23) participants took part in experiment 5. It included
eight sessions with methods and materials similar to those in experiment 1. However, in addition
to the behavior-analytic method for determining the asymmetry ratio electrophysiological
measures (ERPs) were utilized. Recording was continuous during each of the 10 36-min
sessions. The data analysis after signal filtering, amplifying, and averaging focused on the 1-sec
epoch before stimulus presentation and on the 2-sec epoch following stimulus presentation.
Amplitudes and latencies were measured for the within-subject- averaged P100, N100, P200,
N200, and P300.
Hypothesis EEG1. Similar to the hypothesis for the behavioral asymmetry ratios
(BEH1), the asymmetry ratios for ERPs associated with gains and losses were expected to be
approximately 2:1 or 3:1.
Hypothesis EEG2. It was hypothesized that the differences in session’s amplitudes would
demonstrate a learning effect, that is, they would approach stable values over sessions.
Hypothesis EEG3. Higher asymmetry ratios were expected from risk averse participants
compared to risk seekers.
Hypothesis EEG4. In the game when a gain or a loss occurs a message is displayed on
the screen, simultaneously a distinctive sound for gains and another for losses is heard by the

17
participant. Sessions 1 to 7 were played with both stimuli, however, in session 8 we suppressed
the audio so that the participant only responded to the visual stimuli. In this experiment, we are
comparing session 7 and 8 to determine if there is a significant statistical difference with the
presence or absence of sound.
Hypothesis EEG5. The stimulus that signaled gains and losses consisted of two discrete
events. It was hypothesized that the second event would produce a second P300 (2P300) wave
following the first P300 wave.

18
CHAPTER 2: Method
The experiments were conducted at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, UT. The
study protocol was approved by the BYU Institutional Review Board (see Appendix A1), and
written, informed consent was obtained from all participants. A video game was developed to
produce behavioral data. An electronic interface between a coin dispenser and the game and an
interface between the game and an EMOTIV - Brainwear® Wireless EEG Technology device
(Emotive Epoc) were also developed for the research. Figure 1, shows the setting of the
experiment. The game displayed on the screen, a mouse, speakers, a coin dispenser, and the
Emotive Epoc device.

Figure 1. Setting of the experiment

19
Participants
Fifty-three BYU undergraduates (38 male and 15 female: M = 22) participated in the
experiments. They were invited to play the video game in a series of 36-min sessions in which
they could earn money. The in-session earnings were delivered to each participant at the end of a
session. In addition, they received a $30 bonus at the completion of the study. Participants were
also asked to complete a risk questionnaire at the beginning of the first session.
The Risk Questionnaire
The psychological approach to decision making can be traced to Daniel Bernoulli
(1738)/(1954), who explained why people are generally risk averse. Qualls and Puto (1989)
defined risk aversion as a decision maker’s “preference for a guaranteed outcome over a
probabilistic one having an equal expected value” (p. 180). Mandric and Bao (2005) measured
risk aversion using a self-report scale, which was substantially shorter and simpler than other
instruments that use choice dilemmas or batteries of gambles. I used their questionnaire with
some small adjustments. Participants completed the questionnaire in approximately 10 to 15 min.
Participants played the game in an experimental 9 ft by 9 ft room containing a table and chair. A
Dell desktop computer equipped with a 17-in monitor and a mouse was on the table. The room
was artificially illuminated. The computer was connected through an Ethernet connection to a
separate computer located in an adjacent room and that hosted the Emotive EPOC software for
recording the EEG (only experiment 5). Participants were seated in front of the computer
monitor and were asked to read the instructions for the game that appeared there. The
instructions were written in English (see Appendix A3).

20
The SubSearch Game

Figure 2. Subsearch Game
The SubSearch game main screen contained left and right panels. A fixation mark (shown here
as the white plus-sign) preceded the presentation of the gain and loss messages. The cumulative
counters of gains and losses were displayed on the bottom of the screen, as well as the button
between them that the participant was required to click in order to resume the game after a gain or
a loss. Note that a submarine appeared in each panel.

Participants were asked to guide a submarine using the computer mouse and to retrieve as
many yellow objects as possible before reaching the sea floor. If the cursor rested on a
submarine, moving the cursor moved the submarine. If the submarine was placed over one of the
yellow objects, clicking the mouse retrieved the object. Underwater barriers complicated the
submarine’s movement between objects. Once the submarine reached the sea floor within a
panel, it was returned to the surface for a new descent, this time with more frequent barriers.
Thus the game became progressively more difficult as it continued.
The game was played in two different vertical panels separated by a vertical line (see
Figure 2). Each panel was associated with its own interdependent concurrent variable-interval
variable-interval (inter conc VI VI) schedules of reinforcement and punishment, thus creating a
scenario wherein the participants could select between two different, uncertain alternatives.

21
Unlike the independent conc VI VI schedule in which the two schedules are independent of each
other, the interdependent version assigns a reinforcer (or a punisher) according to a preset
probability generator. If, for example, the generator was set to assign twice as many reinforcers
to the left panel than to the right panel (p = 0.67), and the next reinforcer was assigned to the
right panel, then it would be necessary for the participant to produce that reinforcer before the
next one would be assigned. Thus, the interdependent schedule reduces the likelihood of extreme
position (left or right) biases and assures that the scheduled proportion of reinforcers (or
punishers) between the two panels remains close to the proportion of those that are actually
delivered.
The overall schedule was a conjoint schedule, as each panel offered both a schedule of
reinforcement and a schedule of punishment. The scene in each panel slowly scrolled toward the
top of the screen. Only one panel was operative at a time. The other panel was darkened, and
motion was paused (see Figure 1).
After the participant clicked the “Start–OK” message on the screen, a 36-min session
commenced. The game allowed the participant to move the cursor from one panel to the other.
However, each switch produced a changeover delay of 2 secs. During this interval, no reinforcers
or punishers were delivered. Gains and losses were signaled by separate on-screen messages,
each accompanied by a distinctive sound. When a gain or a loss for 0.5 s after which a fixation
signal (+) was presented on the screen with a duration of 0.5 s, then a message was displayed on
the screen indicating a gain or a loss. The messages were “+10¢” for a gain and “-10¢” for a
loss. In the experiment that included the coin dispenser/collector, the two messages were
“Collect a coin to continue” for gains and “Insert a coin to continue” for losses. Coins had a
denomination of 10 cents (dimes). The participants placed coins released by the mechanical

22
dispenser in a nearby container. When asked to deposit coins, participants took them from the
container and inserted them into the device. The on-screen messages appeared for 1 sec. Then a
button located at the bottom of the screen between the cumulative-gain and cumulative-loss
counters started to blink. The game resumed after the participant clicked on the button. In the
experiment that required the use of the coin device, the game resumed following the delivery or
the deposit of a coin.
Each click that occurred during a session was coded, time stamped, and saved to an
external MySQL database. The summary statistics included the total time spent responding in
each panel, the total number of clicks that occurred in each panel, the total numbers of
reinforcers and punishers that occurred in each panel, and the total number of changeovers.
Each session consisted of a fixed sequence of six 6-min conditions (conditions 1-6).
Three of them (1, 3, and 5) contained conc VI VI schedules of reinforcement (gains only) and
three (2, 4, and 6) contained conc VI VI schedules of reinforcement and conc VI VI schedules of
t punishment. Table 1 summarizes the conditions. Condition 1 featured a conc VI1-m VI20-s
schedule, meaning that 25% of the total reinforcers were allocated to the left panel and 75% to
the right panel. There was no schedule of punishment. Condition 2 featured the same conc VI1
VI1 VI-20 schedule of reinforcement and a conc VI1 ext schedule of punishment, where “ext”
refers to extinction that is the absence of reinforcers. In other words, 100% of the punishers were
allocated to the left panel according to a VI1 schedule. No punishments were allocated to the
right panel. The other four conditions featured different reinforcer ratios. Each unpunished
condition was followed by a similar condition that included punishers only in the left panel under
the same schedule as the reinforcers that were delivered in that panel. Each condition was
accompanied by a different background color in both panels, for a total of six different colors. It

23
should be noted that the values of the VI schedules in each concurrent pair of reinforcement
schedules were selected to produce the same overall rate of reinforcement despite the difference
in the ratios of those values (1:3, 1:1, and 3:1). Also, as previously noted, the schedule of
punishment in the right panel was the same as that of reinforcement in the punished conditions.
Thus the ratio of reinforcers to punishers was 1:1. The conditions were not randomized by
sessions.

At the end of each session, participants received the net amount of money they
accumulated during the session. Once they completed the experiment, each received a one-time
bonus of $30.

The Coin Dispenser/Collector
The MEI CASHFLOW® series 7000 was used. It contains five tube cassettes for the
coins that are delivered or collected. An interface with the SubSearch game was developed that
allowed the delivery or collection of coins according to signals generated by the game software.
Figure 3 shows the coin dispenser that was used in this experiment

Figure 3. Coin dispenser / collector
The Emotive Epoc
The Emotiv Epoch EEG (see Figure 3) is a wireless Bluetooth® Smart device (2.4GHz
band), which has 14 electrodes--AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, and
AF4—that transmit at a sample rate of 128 Hz. The device provides access to raw, dense-array,
high-quality EEG data with software subscription. The resolution is 14 bits with 1 LSB = 0.51μV
(16-bit analog to digital converter with 2 bits instrumental noise floor discarded). The bandwidth
is 0.2 – 43Hz with digital notch filters at 50Hz and 60Hz. It includes a digital 5th-order Sinc
filter, and a dynamic range (input referred) of 8400μV. It is AC coupled and powered by a
lithium polymer battery (480mAh). Figure 4 shows the Emotive Epoc device.

25

Figure 4. The Emotiv Epoc – Brainwear®
The EEG
To allow the SubSearch Game to communicate with the EEG, and to monitor the EEG in
real time, the two computers were connected by Ethernet through a single switch. The first
computer ran the Subsearch game. Certain in-game events, such as displaying a gain or a loss
message on the monitor, triggered a signal to the second computer. It collected the EEG data via
a Bluetooth connection. It also compiled the data, temporally aligning the EEG data with the 8bit codes received from Subsearch and saved them to a hard disk. Because of the limitations of
Bluetooth range, both computers were located in the same room, but the interface for the second
computer was in an adjacent room. The final output was a large csv file that contained a timestep column, the 14 electrode channels, and markers for each SubSearch on-screen message.
Data Processing
The data were imported using EEGLab® with the ERPLab® add-on. EEGLab® is an
interactive Matlab® toolbox for processing continuous and event-related EEG,
magnetoencephaographic (MEG), and other electrophysiological data that incorporates

26
independent component analysis (ICA), time/frequency analysis, artifact rejection, event-related
statistics, and several useful modes of visualization of the averaged and single-trial data.
Subsequently, a 1Hz high-pass filter, followed by a 50 Hz low-pass filter, was applied.
Epochs were created for each gain or loss message in the SubSearch game and ranged from
1,000 msec before the message appeared to 2,000 msec after it disappeared. Any epoch
containing an amplitude that exceeded 150 mV was rejected. The epochs were averaged for
gains and losses separately to create a pair of waves for each participant in each session. Then
grand averages were created by averaging each of the waveforms.
Figure 5 shows grand averaged the P300 VEP/ERP waveform (i.e., all subjects) with its
correspondent components. The latencies for the N50, P100, N100, P200, N200, and P300 from
the grand averages per electrode were determined by visual inspection of the waveforms, the
grand averages per participant were processed automatically using as a reference the grand
average per electrode. The amplitudes and latencies for the wave components per individual

27
session were calculated according to the following steps:

Figure 5. Grand Averaged P300 VEP/ERP waveforms
Grand averaged the P300 VEP/ERP waveform (i.e., all subjects) with its correspondent
components

1. The positive and negative peaks from the wave were extracted.

28
2. The N100 component’s latency was set as the lowest peak within 75 msec of the grand
average of the N100 latency.
3. The P300 latency was set as the highest peak within 150 msec of the grand average of
the P300 latency.
4. The N50 latency was set as the lowest peak between it and the new N100 latency.
5. The P100 latency was set as the highest peak between the N50 and the N100.
6. The N200 latency was set as the lowest peak between the N100 and the P300.
7. The P200 latency was set as the highest peak between the N200 and the P300.
To calculate the component associated with the second P300 when it occurred, a similar
process was followed, except, instead of using the grand latencies, the second N100 was
calculated as the lowest point between the first P300 and 1,500 msec, and the second P300 was
calculated as the highest point between the second P100 and 1,900 msec.
Behavioral Data Analysis
All analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics 23 (IBM Corp., 2013, 2015), and
Microsoft Excel®. Measures included the number of responses (clicks) to the left and right
alternatives (BL and BR) and the number of reinforcers (RL and RR). The response ratio BL / BR
and the reinforcer ratio RL / RR were employed in the analysis. The generalized matching relation
was the basis of the analysis of behavioral choice. The results were analyzed using Baum’s
(1974) generalized matching law (Equation 2), which is repeated here:
log (BL / BR) = log k + c log (RL / RR)
The subscripts L and R refer to the left and right alternatives. k and c are constants; k
represents bias, that is, a consistent preference for one alternative over another (Miller, 1976).

29
Bias also may apply to the preference for uncertain losses over certain ones. The other
parameter, c, refers to the sensitivity of behavior to reinforcement or to punishment, that is, the
degree to which the ratio of responses to the two alternatives is affected by changes in the ratio
of reinforcers or punishers. Bias values were calculated for all conditions.
Superimposing schedules of punishment on schedules of reinforcement created a
mathematical challenge that is discussed in chapter 3 and was the reason for the adoption of the
generalized matching law without explicit, formal consideration of punishment, an approach I
identified as the “indirect method”. I calculated the ratio of net reinforcers received on the left
alternative (RL) to those received on the right alternative (RR), as well as the ratio of responses
(BL/BR), then log-transformed each (the logarithmic transformation and the use of geometric
means is also discussed in chapter 3). The log of the response ratio was then expressed as a
function of the log of the reinforcer ratio, and these data were fitted using linear regression. The
antilogarithms of the intercept (b) of the fitted equations for conditions 1, 3, and 5 and for
conditions 2, 4, and 6 were used to calculate the gain/loss ratios, which was the measure of gainloss asymmetry. Table 2 (a sample table) shows the tables structure with means (M), slopes,
intercepts, standard error of the estimate (SE), R2 values, antilogs, and gain/loss ratios from a
linear-regression analysis using the logarithmically transformed generalized matching law. The
format is extensively used in the tables found in the appendices that show the gain/loss ratios
calculations. In the tables the results are presented in two methods: A method that was used by
Rasmussen and Newland that averages the individual slopes, intercepts and R2 values to obtain
the means for all participants (or categories) and a method that is labeled as the standard method
with the results of the regression algorithm used in SPSS®.

To maintain consistency with other previous studies, the linear regression intercepts were
used to calculate the gain/loss ratios in the behavioral measurement section. However, a Linear
Mixed Model (LMM) was used in addition to the linear regression to determine statistical
significance with two constraints: 1) the estimated means vary but not substantially from the
estimated means (intercepts) calculated using linear regression and 2) due to the behavioral
experiments were conducted independently, the LMM was also used, to analyze the data
independently for each experiment. The electrophysiological analysis uses a full LMM with all
factors incorporated in the analysis as only one experiment. The estimated means of the LMM
(equivalent to the intercepts of the linear regressions) were used for the calculation of the gain/loss
ratios. The LMM was also used to determine statistical significance.

31
ERP Data Analysis
The analysis of the averaged ERPs focused on the previously indicated various
components of the average signal, with each component characterized by its amplitude, polarity
(positive or negative), and latency. An ERP waveform unambiguously consists of a series of
peaks (here termed positive peaks) and troughs (negative peaks), but these voltage deflections
reflect the sum of several relatively independent underlying or latent components. To isolate the
latent components so that they could be measured independently was challenging. Considerable
effort was made to successfully distinguish between the observable peaks of the waveform and
the unobservable latent components. The SubSearch video game was designed to minimize latent
components and to make sure that the evoked P300 was, as much as possible, a direct result of
the experimental design. An important objective of the design was to separate the processes
related to monetary gains and losses from possible confounding factors. The EEG does not only
record ERPs but also other, “noisy” signals. The method I used to reduce the latter signals was
signal averaging. All the analyses featured epochs that were time-locked to the onset of the
fixation signal that preceded the on-screen messages announcing reinforcers and punishers.
Additionally, the modulating effects of valence and magnitude on the ERPs were examined.
Figure 6 shows the sequence of events in the video game. The ERP epochs started with a blank
screen that appeared simultaneously with scheduled delivery or a reinforcer or punisher. Fivehundred msec later, a fixation mark appeared on the screen. After another 500 msec had passed,
the gain or loss message appeared on the screen. It was designed to signal the onset of the P300.
Analysis of the epoch began 500 msec previous to the fixation signal. Immediately following the
presentation of the reinforcer (or punisher) message, which remained on the screen until the
participant resumed the game), there was a 1000-msec delay until the button at the bottom of the

32
screen between the two cumulative counters began to blink. During this interval, the game was
inoperative and remained so until the participant clicked the button. Indeed, it was this click that
was assumed to generate a second waveform similar to the P300.

APPENDIX A
Consent to Be a Research Participant

Introduction
The current study is being conducted by Diego G. Flores, a doctoral student in Psychology,
under the direction of Harold Miller PhD. (BYU Professor of Psychology) and Harold Miller’s
research team of graduate and undergraduate students. In order to decide whether or not you
wish to be a part of this research study you should know enough about its risks and benefits to
make an informed decision. This consent form gives you detailed information about the study,
which a member of the research team will discuss with you.
Purpose
The research examines the effects of gains and losses.
Procedure
You will be asked to play a game on a computer for ten separate 30 to 60 minute sessions. At the
beginning of the first session or the end of the last session you will be required to complete a 10
minute questionnaire (only once) that includes multiple-choice and yes/no questions. The
sessions will take place in Harold Miller’s laboratory (1190C SWKT). You will be asked to read
instructions written in English. You will be seated in front of a computer monitor and provided
with a computer mouse. The mouse will allow you to move two small submarines around
obstacles in order to contact floating targets. A coin dispenser will be connected to the computer.
When you make contact with a target, a message will appear on the screen indicating that you
can collect or insert a coin. The game will resume when you have done so. You should try to
collect as many coins as possible.
Two of the sessions will include an electro-encephalogram (EEG). While you play the game, we
will measure brain-wave activity from sensors placed on you scalp while you complete the task.
We will use a neuro-technology for personal interface for human computer interaction. The
Emotiv EPOC is a high resolution, multi-channel, wireless neuro-headset. The sensors for
recording brain activity are both painless and harmless; they merely record the small electrical
signals produced by your body. The experimenter will clearly explain where the sensors will
placed before applying them.
Additional instructions to play the game are attached to this form.
Risk/Discomforts
There are minimal risks for participating in this study. The risks associated with EEG in this
study do not differ from a standard clinical EEG. Sensors are cleaned and disinfected after each
use.
Benefits
There are no known direct benefits to you as a result of participating in this study.

Risk Aversion Survey

A. Selected original items from the CDQ (Kogan and Wallach, 1964)
1.

Mr. D is the captain of College X’s football team. College X is playing its traditional rival, College Y, in
the final game of the season. The game is in its final seconds, and Mr. D’s team, College X, is behind in the
score. College X has time to run one more play. Mr. D, the captain, must decide whether it would be best to
settle for a tie score with a play which would be almost certain to work or, on the other hand, to try a more
complicated and risky play that could bring victory if it succeeded but defeat if it did not..
Imagine that you are advising Mr. D. Listed below are several probabilities or odds that the risky play will
work. Please check the lowest probability that you would consider acceptable for the risky play to be
attempted.
-------- Place a check here if you think Mr. D should not attempt the risky play no matter what the
probabilities.
-------- The chances are 9 in 10 that the risky play will work.
-------- The chances are 7 in 10 that the risky play will work.
-------- The chances are 5 in 10 that the risky play will work.
-------- The chances are 3 in 10 that the risky play will work.
-------- The chances are 1 in 10 that the risky play will work.

2.

Mr. F is currently a college senior who is very eager to pursue graduate study in chemistry to obtain the
Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. He has been accepted by both University X and University Y.
University X has a world-wide reputation for excellence in chemistry. Although a degree from University
X would signify outstanding training in this field, the standards are so rigorous that only a fraction of the
degree candidates actually receive the degree. University Y, on the other hand, has much less of a
reputation in chemistry, but almost everyone admitted to the program is awarded the Ph.D. degree, which
has much less prestige than the corresponding degree from University X.
Imagine that you and several colleagues are advising Mr. F. Listed below are several probabilities or odds
that Mr. F would be awarded a degree at University X, the one with the much-greater prestige. Please check
the lowest probability that you would find acceptable to make it worthwhile for Mr. F to enroll in
University X rather than University Y.
-------- Place a check here if you think Mr. F should not enroll in University X, no matter what the
probabilities.
-------- The chances are 9 in 10 that Mr. F would receive a degree from University X.

36
-------- The chances are 7 in 10 that Mr. F would receive a degree from University X.
-------- The chances are 5 in 10 that Mr. F would receive a degree from University X.

Instructions for the SubSearch Game
In this session, you will play a videogame in which you steer a submarine between sea
barriers to make contact with undersea coins. To move the sub, click the mouse on the screen to
indicate where the sub should go.
The screen will be divided vertically in half—each side with its own sub and coins. You
may switch from one side to the other at any time. You will also notice the screen color changing
from time to time. Something about the game also changes at that time.
Sometimes when the sub picks up a coin, a message will appear on the screen indicating
that you can collect the coin and increasing your winnings. The game will resume when you
have done so. When the sub reaches the treasure chest on the sea floor, you will move to the next
level of the game.
Now and then, in addition to the message that tells you to collect a coin, there will be
another message that tells you to deposit a coin, which will decrease your winnings. The game
will resume when you have deposited the coin.
You should try to collect as many coins as possible. Once the session ends, you will
receive a cash payment based on the number of coins you collected. You will receive a cash
bonus of $30 at the end of the experiment.
If you are interested in receiving a report of the research, please notify the experimenter,
who will ask for your contact information.

CHAPTER 3: Models of Matching and the Results from Experiments 1-3
The purpose of general laws is to explain and predict observable phenomena through the
use of numbers and numerical operations—a process called measurement. The laws I have cited
previously are Herrnstein’s matching law (1961) and the generalized matching law (Baum,
1974). Both utilize behavioral events, such as responses, and environmental events, such as
reinforcers to measure choice between alternatives. They have been used effectively in cases
where reinforcers are used to influence an individual’s behavior. However, the effort to add
punishers to the g laws creates complications. As described earlier, in the generalized-matchinglaw approach to the current research, B represents the total number of clicks of the mouse and R
the total number of reinforcers. Subscripts identify the left (L) and right (R) panels on the screen.
The constants k and c represent sensitivity and bias parameters, respectively. The dependent
variable is the ratio BL/BR, and the independent variable is the ratio RL/RR, which represents the
ratio of reinforcers received on the left to those received on the right. Punishers, represented by
P, were only delivered in the left panel. Here I consider a series of mathematical models of
matching involving these variables and summarize their relative merits.
Models for Measuring the Asymmetry of Monetary Gains and Losses
I considered several models in order to accurately represent the conjoining of reinforcers
and punishers. I summarize them here in three different groups: Adding punishers (ADD
models), subtracting punishers (SUB models), and an indirect method (NP models) that does not
take punishers into account at all. The optional use of geometric means and logarithmic
transformations generated additional submodels in each category.

40
Adding Punishers (ADD Model)
Deluty (1976) and de Villiers (Villiers, 1977, 1980) developed two different quantitative
models of punishment, which can be viewed as mathematical versions of the avoidance theory of
punishment and the negative law of effect, respectively (Mazur, 2006). Both are rooted in
Herrnstein’s (1961) matching law. The ADD model is based on Deluty’s (1976, 1982), where
punishers are added to reinforcers, and the resulting version of the matching law is written as:
BL/ (BL + BR) = (RL + PR) / [(RL + PR) + (RR + PL)].

(4)

This equation can be expressed in terms of response and reinforcer ratios (Gray, Stafford, &
Tallman, 1991):
BL / BR = (RL + PR) / (RR + PL). (5)
According to Gray et al., “This model suggests that the obtained levels of reinforcement operate
directly on the behavior, while obtained frequencies of punishment operate inversely but in an
additive manner.” (1991, p. 320)
Subtracting Punishers (SUB Model)
In de Villiers’ (1977, 1980) model, punishers are subtracted from reinforcers. Rasmussen
and Newland (2008, p. 59) used de Villers’ model and observed that:
. . . Few studies have examined matching with human participants and punishment, but in those
studies, the punisher tends to subtract value from the reinforcers earned on an alternative,
changing the value associated with that alternative and, therefore, the proportion of behavior
allocated to the punished alternative. (2008, p. 59)

41
The mathematical model is:
BL / BR = (RL - PL) / (RR - PR).

(6)

According to Rasmussen and Newland (2008), Deluty and de Villiers “found strong support for
the subtractive model of punishment” (Rasmussen & Newland, 2008, p. 58).
In my research, the experimental design frequently produced a negative value of the ratio
after subtracting punishers from reinforcers. This rendered the logarithmic transformation of the
generalized matching law a mathematical impossibility. Consequently, several adjustments to
Equation 6 were considered and are summarized below.
The Non-negative SUB model (NNSUB). This model was identical to Equation 6 but
excluded instances in which the ratio featuring reinforcers and punishers was negative,
The effect of this adjustment was to substantially affect the size of the resulting ratio and
thus bring the measure of gain-loss asymmetry into question.
The Inverted SUB Model (INVSUB). This model is also identical to Equation 6, however,
I used a mathematical artifice to avoid the calculation of logarithms of negative numbers. The
artifice consisted of transforming only the negative numbers into positive numbers before the
calculation of the logarithms, after the logarithms are obtained then the sign of the values are
reversed, following that, the antilogs are calculated.
The Absolute Value SUB model (ABSSUB). This model altered the SUB model as
follows:
BL / BR = | (RL - PL) | / | (RR – PR) |.

(7)

42
Subsequently the absolute value of the difference of RL - PR is obtained and used to
calculate the ratio. Another artifice –raising the ratios to the square to handle only positive
values- can be used, however, results are equal to using the absolute value.
The SUB Plus k Model (SUBK).
In this model, the constant k is added to the ratios in order to eliminate negative values:
(BL / BR) + k = [(RL - PR) / (RR – PL)] + k.

(8)

The Indirect or No Punishment (NP)
A different approach to modeling the relationship between reinforcers and punishers was
Equation 3. The logic of the model is that the effect of punishers may be measured indirectly by
any displacement of the effects of reinforcers. In other words, it is not necessary to conjoin
reinforcers and punishers in order to measure their asymmetry. This model eliminates the
problem of negative ratio values,
The Non-Linear (NL) Model
Considering the limitations of logarithmic transformation due to negative numbers, the
Non-linear Model (NL) applied nonlinear regression to the generalized matching law.
Logarithmic and Geometric Transformations
Logarithmic transformation can be used to make highly skewed distributions less skewed.
This can enhance the identification of patterns in the data, at the same time more readily meeting
the assumptions of inferential statistics. Similarly, the use of geometric means "normalizes" the
data distribution. In the present analysis, two categories (Log or No Log) were applied to the use

43
of logarithms and two other categories (GeoMean or NoGeoMean) to the use of geometric
means.
Experiment 1
Experiment 1 utilized the methods and data analytic procedures previously described.
The results are presented in the following order: First, the gain/loss ratio was calculated using the
different models already introduced. Second, a criterion for the selection of the preferred model
was determined. Third, the overall gain/loss ratio was calculated using the preferred model.
Fourth, the gain/loss ratio as a function of gender was calculated. Fifth, the gain/loss ratio as a
function of risk was calculated. Table B1 in Appendix B at the end of the chapter displays the
means for responses, obtained reinforcers, obtained punishers, and changeovers for all 26
participants in the non-punished conditions of this experiment. The corresponding results for the
punished conditions appear in Table B2 in the same appendix.
Calculation of the Gain/Loss Ratio Using Different Models
Table 3 is a summary of the gain/loss ratios per category and model. The global average of the
gain/loss ratios across all categories was 2.05 (see Appendix B). The rightmost column displays
the absolute difference between the respective ratio and the grand average. The details of the
ratios calculations are included in Appendix B (Tables B3 - B8). The submodel column serves to
identify the model in the appendix.

Criteria for the Selection of a Model
Table 4 is a summary of the criteria by which I evaluated the models in order to select
one that was best-fitting. Four criterion were used with a scale of 1 to 6. The lowest the score the
best fit. Central Tendency: the close the mean of the model to the global mean the lowest the
score. Consistency Within Models: the sum of the absolute differences from the global mean
inside each model, the lowest the difference the lowest the score (INVSUB obtained the highest
score due to the formula is not applicable in all categories). Consistency Across Models: the
lowest the standard deviation of the submodels inside the model the lowest the score. And
Parsimony, the easiest to use the model the lowest the score. Based on the criteria NP was the
best and ADD the second best model.

Gain/Loss Ratio Results
The Overall Gain/Loss Ratio
Hypothesis BEH1 (see chapter 1) stated that the expected value of the asymmetry of
gains and losses would be between 2 and 3, which is consistent with the earlier findings of
Kahneman and Tversky (1979) and Rasmussen and Newland (2008). There was a highly
significant difference between the unpunished and punished conditions at the .01 level F (1.464) =
154.790, p = 0.000. Small significance values (that is, those less than 0.01) indicated that the
effect contributed to the latent factors model. For the statistical analysis, log (RL/RR) was the
independent variable and log (CL/CR) was a covariate. Punishment was the factor analyzed in the
model to determine the significance of the gains and losses. The estimates of the covariate
residual were: estimate = 0.143500, SE = 0.009421. The estimated marginal grand mean was -

49
0.221 and the SE = 0.018. The punished mean was -0.48, SE = 0.25 and the unpunished mean
was -0.395, SE = 0.025. The gain/loss ratio 2.23, confirming Hypothesis BHE1.

Gender
Hypothesis BEH2 stated that there would be gender differences in the asymmetry of
gains and losses. The results of the mixed model analyses were that the difference between male
and female participants was significant at the 0.05 level Gender F (1.460) = 3.954, p = 0.047,
Punishment F (1.460) = 91.566, p = 0.000. All other interactions were not significant at the 0.05
level. The estimated covariate residual was 0.142731 and the SE = 0.009411. The estimated
marginal grand mean was -0.216 and the SE = 0.018. Table 7 displays the means, SEs, df, and
95% confidence interval (CI) for the interaction between punishment and gender. The means of
the LMM matched the intercepts (k) in the linear regressions that were used to calculate the
gain/loss ratios.

Based on the means (intercepts) obtained in the regression analysis (see Table D1 in
Appendix D) the gain/loss ratios were calculated. The overall ratio for male subjects was 1.92
and for females 2.49, which supported Hypothesis BEH2.

51
Risk
The LMM was used to analyze the asymmetry of gains and losses between risk-averse
(RA) and risk-seeking (RS) participants. The difference was highly significant at the 0.01 level
Punishment F (1.460) = 130.107, p = 0.000, Risk F (1.460) = 47.451, p = 0.000, and Punishment *
Risk F (1.460) = 50.313, p = 0.000. All other interactions were not significant at the 0.01 level.
The estimate of the covariate residual was 0.117580, SE = 0.007753, and of the estimated
marginal grand mean was -0.229, SE = 0.016, df = 460, 95% CI [-0.261,-0.198].
Table 8 displays the means of the LMM, SEs, df, and 95% CI for the interaction of

A complete list of the participants with their respective individual risk scores, slopes,
intercepts, R2 values, and gain/loss ratios for the unpunished and punished alternatives is
displayed in Table E1 in Appendix E. The overall gain/loss ratio for the RA participants was

52
3.89 and for the RS participants 1.38, thus supporting the hypothesis that RA participants would
have higher asymmetry ratios compared to risk seekers.
Risk Mediated by Gender
In addition to the RA versus RS comparison, the analysis was extended to RA versus RS
differences mediated by gender. A complete list of the participants with their respective risk
scores, slopes, intercepts, R2 values, and gain/loss ratios for the unpunished and punished
alternatives is displayed in Table E2 (see Appendix E).
The results were significant at the 0.01 level Punishment F (1.452) = 112.255, p = 0.000.
Gender F (1.452) = 4.037, p = 0.045, and Punishment * Risk F (1.452), 24.729, p = 0.000. Risk F
(1.452)

= 41.182, p = 0.000 was significant at the 0.05 level. All other interactions were not

significant at the 0.05 level. The estimate of the covariate residual was 0.125436 and the SE =
0.008344. The estimated marginal grand mean was -0.225 and the SE = 0.017, df = 452, 95% CI
[-0.258,-0.192].
Table 9 shows the means, SEs, df, and 95% CI for the interaction of punishment and risk.
As before, the means were the intercepts in the linear regressions that were used to calculate the
gain/loss ratios (see Table E3 in Appendix E for a full summary of the ratio calculations).
The LMM analyses resulted in a significant difference between the unpunished and
punished conditions, F (1.452) = 112.255, p = 0.000, between the male and female participants F
(1.452)

= 4.037, p = 0.045, between RA and RS participants, F (1.452) = 41.182, p = 0.000, and for

the interaction of punishment and risk F (1.452) = 24.729, p = 0.000. Punishment, risk, and
punishment * risk were significant at the 0.01 level. However, gender was significant at the 0.05
level.

53
Hypothesis BEH3 stated that a higher asymmetry ratio for gains and losses was expected
for RA participants compared to RS participants. The overall gain/loss ratio for RA males was
2.95 and for RS males 1.35 for an overall asymmetry value of 2.18. The overall gain/loss ratio
for the RA females was 3.70 and for the RS females was 1.76. Thus, RA female showed an
overall asymmetry value 2.11 times higher than that for RS females. Hypothesis BEH3 was
accepted.

Experiment 2
Experiment 2 followed the analysis procedure as in Experiment 1. Participants completed
six sessions in which cumulative gains and losses were displayed as points on the monitor

54
screen. Only the last three sessions 4-6) were included in the analysis. During two additional
sessions (7-8) featured the use of a coin dispenser/collector device in addition to the counters
displayed on the screen (CD Refers to the coin dispenser/collector device).
Hypothesis BEH4 stated that participants were expected show increased loss aversion
when playing the game using coins. A Linear Mixed Model (LMM) was used in which the
independent variable was log (RL/RR), the covariate was log (CL/CR), and punishment and the
coin dispenser were factors.
The results were: Punishment F (1.754), 223.917, p = 0.000, Coin Dispenser F (1.754) =
7.156, p = 0.008; Punishment * Coin Dispenser F (1.746), 12.968, p = 0.000. All other interactions
were not significant at the 0.01 level. The estimate of the covariate residual was 0.167586 and
the SE = 0.008631. The estimated marginal grand mean was -0.293 and the SE = 0.015, df = 754,
95% CI [-0.293,-0.233].
Table 10 is a summary of the means, SEs, df, and 95% CI for the interaction of
punishment and coin dispenser/collector. The means are he intercepts from the linear regressions
that were used to calculate the gain/loss ratios (see Table F1 in Appendix F for a full summary of
the individual ratios for the participants playing the game points only and Table F2 for those for
the two sessions feature cash as well).
Hypothesis BEH4 stated that participants would produce a larger gain/loss ratio when
playing the game using coin dispenser/collector compared to points only. The gain/loss ratio for
the latter condition was 2.23 and for the former was 3.70. That is participants playing the game
with points and also the coin dispenser/collector demonstrated an asymmetry 1.66 higher than

55
that when they played the game with points only. Thus, hypothesis BH4 was accepted. Details
are presented in Table F3 and Table F4 in Appendix F.

Effects of Payoff Type Mediated by Gender
The LMM was also used to determine whether there was a significant difference between
results from the payoff conditions of points only and points plus the coin dispenser/collector
device that was mediated by gender differences.
The results were: Punishment F (1.746), 205.942, p = 0.000; Gender F (1.746) = 2.344, p =
0.126; Coin Dispenser F (1.746) = 7.387, p = 0.007; Punishment * Coin Dispenser F (1.746), 12.107,
p = 0.001. All other interactions were not statistically significant at the 0.01 level. The estimate
of the covariate residual was 0.167510 and the SE = 0.008673. The estimated marginal grand
mean was -0.259 and the SE = 0.016, df = 746, CI [-0.289,-0.228].

Points

The gain/loss ratio for female participants in the points-only condition was 2.49 and 4.06
in the points-plus-cash condition. That is, the latter condition produced an asymmetry value for
the points-plus-cash condition that was 1.63 greater than that for the points-only condition. The
gain/loss ratio for male participants in the points-only condition was 1.92 and 3.19 in the pointsplus-cash condition. That is, the latter condition produced an asymmetry value for the pointsplus-cash condition that was 1. 66 greater than that for the points-only condition. Female-VC

57
were 1.29 more sensitive to losses compared to male-VC and female-CC were 1.26 more
sensitive to losses compared to male-CC. Hypothesis BEH4 was accepted.
Experiment 3
Experiment 3 utilized the same data-analysis procedure as previously described. A group
of 11 male participants (M = 22) was recruited to complete six sessions. They did so
competitively, namely, each of them received information about the other participants’ gains and
losses prior to sessions 1-6. The 11 male participants (M = 22) of experiment 1 served as the
control group. The control group did not receive information about other participants.
Hypothesis BEH5 stated that, in a competitive setting, participants would produce higher
gain/loss ratios than those produced by participants who played the game without information
about other participants’ performance. A Linear Mixed Model (LMM) was used to test the
differences between participants without information (NC) and those with information (C) and
within the competition group risk averse (RA) and risk seekers (RS) were also tested for
gain/loss differences. The independent variable was log (RL/RR), the covariate was log (CL/CR),
and punishment and competition were factors.
The results were: Punishment F (1, 388) = 81.427, p = 0.000; Competition F (1, 388) = 422, p
= 0.516; Punishment * Competition F (1, 388) = 0.108, p = 0.742. All other interactions were not
statistically significant at the 0.01 level. The estimate of the covariate residual was 0.104209, and
the SE = 0.007482.

Table 12 displays the means, SEs, df, and 95% CI for the interaction of punishment and

CHAPTER 4: Behavioral Measurement of an Unselfish Act
Experiment 4
The classical economic view of individual decision making emphasizes rationality and
self-interest (Yamagishi, Li, Haruto Takagishi, Matsumoto, & Kiyonari, 2014) as essential for
the maximization of subjective utility. Unselfish or altruistic behavior has been defined, in
economic terms, as "…costly acts that confer economic benefits on other individuals” (Fehr &
Fischbacher, 2003). Such costly acts expose an anomaly in the utilitarian perspective. The Homo
economicus described by Korn and Ziesecke (2013) or the Econ of Thaler and (2009) is
consistent with Bentham’s orthodoxy (1775/1988) that utility maximization is the fundamental
motive in individual behavior. According to Thales and Sustein (2009), “Econs do not have
passions; they are cold-blooded optimizers” (p. 7). The altruist, however, will forego optimizing
her or his utility for the benefit of others’ utility. Working from a different perspective,
Rachlin and Locey (2011a) observed that the “individual altruistic act apparently has no
reinforcer; if it did, it would not be altruistic. Altruism thus seems to defy behavioral analysis”
and further suggested that the assumption of the maximization goal of Homo economicus might
be erroneous.
Rachlin and Locey (2011a) provided three potential explanations for altruistic behavior.
The first assumes that such behavior allows a person to avoid being a free-loader within her or
his society. The second explanation is that altruists maximize reward over a series of choices and
not necessarily in individual choices. The third explanation “assumes that people's altruism is
based on a straightforward balancing of undiscounted costs to themselves against discounted
benefits to others (social discounting)” (p. 25).

79
Fehr and Fischbacher (2003 ) proposed a different account of altruistic actions. First,
they recognized that social norms can clearly influence altruistic behavior. In the ultimatum
game (Guth, Schmittberger, & Schwarze, 1982), for instance, the two participants have to agree
on how to divide a fixed sum of money that has been assigned to one of them. That person
proposes the amount, and the other person accepts or rejects it. Most people will reject the
proposed amount if they consider it unfair even though they will receive nothing. In doing so,
they punish the proposer’s perceived unfair behavior. Fehr and Fischbacher explained that such
rejections in the ultimatum game can be viewed as altruistic punishment, because most people
view the equal split as the fair outcome, and, thus, a rejection of a lower offer punishes the
proposer for violating a social norm. Fehr and Fischbacher also reported that:
Recent results on the neurobiology of cooperation in the prisoners’ dilemma [another
social game widely used for the study of reciprocity] support the view that individuals
experience particular subjective rewards from mutual cooperation. If subjects achieve the
mutual cooperation outcome with another human subject, the brain’s reward circuit
(components of the mesolimbic dopamine system including the striatum and the
orbitofrontal cortex) is activated relative to a situation in which subjects achieve mutual
cooperation with a programmed computer. Moreover, there is also evidence indicating a
negative response of the dopamine system if a subject cooperates but the opponent
defects (p. 788).
In the experiment, the question I sought to answer was: Would individuals behave
differently if the gains they received were transferred to a charity of their choice rather than
being retained personally? Higher asymmetry ratios were expected from participants when they
profited personally than when they made donations to charity. Moreover, in this experiment, I

80
administered a questionnaire to each participant that assessed their level of risk aversion and risk
seeking. I predicted that those who were risk-averse would display a greater asymmetry between
gains and losses that those who were risk-seeking.
In this experiment the principal hypothesis (BEH6) was that higher asymmetry ratios
were expected from participants when they profited personally than when they made donations
to charity.
Method
Experiment 4 utilized the methods and data analytic procedures previously described
aided by the coin dispenser/collector that was also used in experiment 3. The experiment
consisted of two phases with four sessions in phase 1 and six in phase 2. The participants were
randomly assigned in two groups—Profit and Charity—for phase 1. The first phase of the
experiment is a comparison between both groups (profit and charity). The net gains that
participants in the Profit group obtained per session were paid to them. In the Charity group, the
participants donated the net gains to a charitable organization of their choice. In phase 2, both
groups were exposed to alternating sessions in which they either received net gains directly or
donated the gains to a charity of their choice. The experiment was designed to compare the
behavior of participants in punished and unpunished conditions and in conditions in which they
either received money personally or donated it to charity. Also, I nested gender within the risk
variable.
In sum, I studied gender differences in risk taking in relation to performance in the video
game where personal winnings were either received directly or donated to the charity of one’s
choice. This latter distinction represented self-interest versus altruism, respectively.

81
Participants
The participants were 10 students (five females) that did not participate in previous
experiments related to gain/loss asymmetry. They were invited to play the video game in a series
of 36-min sessions in which they could earn money. The in-session earnings were delivered to
each participant at the end of a session. In addition, they received a $30 bonus at the completion
of the study. Participants were also asked to complete a risk questionnaire at the beginning of the
first session.
Data Analysis Plan
The analysis plan included: a linear mixed, asymmetry ratios, and linear regressions. The
experiment included 10 sessions, but the data from only the first session were dropped rather
than those in the first three sessions as in experiments 1 to 3.
Results
Phase 1: Group, Condition, and Gender Comparison
Table 13 displays an abridged summary of fixed effect” for Phase 1 (a complete table—
H1— is provided in the Appendix H at the end of the chapter). Both Punishment and Gender
were significant at the 0.05 level. However, there was a significant interaction between
Punishment and Gender. Group (Profit vs. Charity) was not significant, but its interactions with
Gender was close significance (0.064). Table H2 also appears in Appendix H2 and lists the
corresponding estimated marginal means.

In Appendix H, Table H3 for the unpunished condition and Table H4 for the punishment
conditions summarize each participant’s mean responses, obtained reinforcers, obtained
punishers, and changeovers for each alternative under the concurrent VI-VI schedules and
categorized as Gender, Charity, and Profit, as well as their corresponding standard deviations.
Table 14 shows the means of the ratios that are displayed for each participant in Tables
H5 and H6 in Appendix H Table H5 shows the slopes (c), intercepts (log k), R2 for the linear
regressions, and the correspondent gain/loss ratios, as well as, the standard errors of the estimate,
for participant. The data are organized by Punishment and No punishment conditions, Group,
and Gender. Table H6 is organized similarly; however, it displays the results summarized by
category.

83
The asymmetry ratio for the Profit group (1.94) was nearly the same as for the Charity
group (1.86) However, within the Profit Group, the female participants (3.07) were 2.24 more
sensitive to losses than the male participants (1.37). Within the Charity group, males (1.73) and
females (1.88) were close to being the same.

Female participants displayed a loss aversion when they were playing the game for
charity that was approximately two-thirds (0.63) of the loss aversion they displayed when
playing for themselves. By contrast, the males in the Charity Group displayed a loss aversion
approximately one-fifth (0.21) that of the males in the Profit group.
Phase 2: Group, Session, and Risk Comparison
Table 15 displays an abridged summary for phase 2; the complete table (I1) appears in
Appendix I. The effects of Punishment and Risk were significant. However, there was also a
significant interaction between the two. Group and Sessions were not significant. Table I2 also
appears in Appendix I and includes the estimated marginal means.

Table I3 and I4 (see Appendix I) displays the data for each participant in sessions 5-10.
Table I3 in Appendix I summarizes the mean responses, obtained reinforcers, obtained
punishers, and changeovers under the concurrent VI-VI schedules for the No punished condition
and I4 for the punished condition. The categories appearing in the table are Group (Profit and

85
Charity), Sessions (Paid and Not-paid), Gender (Male and Female), and Risk (Averse and
Seeking). Sessions 5, 7, and 9 were paid and sessions 6, 8 and 10 were not paid.
Table 16 summarizes the mean asymmetry ratios that are displayed in Table I5 (see
Appendix I). Table I5 displays the values of sensitivity (c), (log k), and R2 as well as the
loss/gain ratios and the standard error of the estimate.

The mean ratios for the Profit group were similar: 2.01 (Not paid) and1.84 (paid). Those
for the Charity group were nearly identical: 1.88 (Not Paid) and 1.91 (Paid).
Table 17 summarizes the asymmetry ratios found in Table I6 (see appendix I) for Risk
nested within the Group and Session categories. In every case, the ratio for the Risk-averse was
higher than that for Risk-seeking participants. It is also the case that, within both groups (Profit
and Charity) and Session types (Not Paid and Paid), the Risk-averse participants produced a
higher asymmetry ratio than the Risk-seeking participants did.

Table 19 is a summary of Table J3 and shows the asymmetry ratios for Gender nested
within Profit, Session, and Risk. In every case, the asymmetry ratio for females exceeded that for
males. Due to we used a risk median for male and female and the small number of participants
there were not RA females in the charity group

88
Discussion
Higher asymmetry ratios were expected from participants when they profited personally
than when they made donations to charity (Hypothesis BEH6). No significant differences were
found between the profit and the charity group and between the paid and unpaid sessions. The
utilitarian approach would have forecasted that participants would have traded one alternative for
the other or substituted one for the other opting for the one that provides the highest utility.
Hypothesis BEH6 was rejected. However, the results contradicted the utilitarian perspective.
Significant differences were found between male and female participants and between risk
averse and risk seekers.

CHAPTER 5: Analyzing Gain-Loss Asymmetry Using Behavioral and Electrophysiological
Measures
Experiment 5
This chapter reports an experiment in which participants played the SubSearch game
while the electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from their scalp. Thus, the behavioranalytic data from the game could be related to the corresponding electrophysiological data.
There were 16 male subjects (age mean=23), who were recruited from undergraduate students at
Brigham Young University. The experiment consisted of eight sessions in which the game was
synchronized with the Emotive Epoc® software. Evoked-response potential (ERP) recording was
continuous during the 36-min session. Following filtering, amplifying, and averaging the ERP
record, the data analysis was focused on the 1 s before and the 2 s following each onscreen
presentation of a gain or a loss. Amplitude and latency were measured for each peak of the
averaged, within-participant ERP components: N50, P100, N100, P200, N200, and P300. The
experiment involved four distinctive phases. The behavioral-analytic results will be presented
before the electrophysiological results.

109
Behavioral-analytic Results
Table K1 in Appendix K displays the results of the analysis using the Linear Mixed
Methods (LMM) model described in Chapter 3. The model included four factors: Participants
(ID), gains and losses (GainLoss), risk (RiskCat), and sessions (SessionNum). The dependent
variable was log (CL/CR) that is the logarithm of total mouse clicks in the left panel of the
monitor screen divided by total clicks in the right panel. The covariate was log (RL/RR), the
logarithm of the total number of left reinforcers divided by the total number of right reinforcers.
Hypothesis EEG1, EEG2, and EEG3. Gain and Loss, Sessions, and Risk
It was expected an asymmetry of gains and losses between 2:1 or 3:1 (EEG1), significant
differences between sessions due to a learning effect (EEG2), significant difference between
Risk Averse and Risk Seekers (EEG3)
The application of the model showed only a significant outcome for GainLoss at 0.01
level F (1, 583) = 378.703, p = .000. The other factors Risk, F (6, 583) = .100, p = .751and Session F
(1, 583) =

2.043, p = .058 were not significant nor were there significant interactions. The estimates

of the covariance parameters were residual = 0.096783, SE = .005669, and the estimated
marginal grand mean was -0.306, SE = .014, df =583, 95% CI [-.333,-.2.79].

Table 20 contains the mean gain-loss ratios for each session and overall, and also the
ratios for participants in the two categories of risk in sessions 1-7. The ratios of gains and losses
were higher than most of those obtained in previous experiments, loss amplitudes are higher than
gain amplitudes (3.40). The difference in gain/loss ratios for participants in the two risk
categories was typically lower. Tables K2 and K3 in Appendix K show the mean responses,
obtained reinforcers, punishers, and switches for the punished and for the unpunished
alternatives respectively. Table K4 in Appendix K shows the individual gain/loss ratios for all
participants. In addition, Table K5 displays the calculation of the overall ratio, Table K6 the
calculation of the gain/loss ratios for risk-averse and risk-seeking participants, Table K7 the
calculations of the gain/loss ratios per session, and Table K8 the gain/loss ratios for the

111
interaction of session and risk. Hypothesis EEG1 was partially accepted. Loss amplitudes were
higher than gains, but the ratio of 3.40:1 was larger than 2:1 or 3:1 that was expected. There were
not significant differences in Risk and Sessions consequently both hypothesis EEG2 and EEG 3
were rejected. Note, however that the trend in the risk aversion group is positive and in the risk
seekers group is negative. Risk averse tend to increase risk aversion and risk seekers tend to
decrease risk aversion.
Hypothesis EEG4. The Use of Different Stimuli for Gains and Losses in Sessions 7 and 8:
Behavioral Measures.
Table L1 displays the results of the application of the LMM. As in the previous six
sessions, both an auditory stimulus and a visual stimuli signaled gains and losses in session 7. In
session 8, however, only visual stimuli were used. Fifteen participants completed session 7, and
12 completed session 8. The dependent variable was log (CL/CR), the covariate was log (RL/RR),
and the factors were: ID, gain/loss (GainLoss), and sessions 7 and 8 (SessionNum). The results
included a significant difference for GainLoss, F (1, 151) = 129.614, p = 0.000. SessionNum was
not significant F (1, 151) = 2.301, p = 0.131 was not significant. The estimates of the covariance
parameters were for the covariate residual = 0.112098, SE= 0.012901 and the estimated marginal
grand mean -0.305, SE = 0.027 df =151, 95% CI [-0.358,-0.252]. The gain-loss asymmetry in
session 7 was 4.08, which is 1.30 times higher than in session 8 that was 3.14. Tables L2 and L3
in the Appendix L show the mean responses, obtained reinforcers, punishers, and switches for
the unpunished and punished conditions respectively for Session 7 and similar information for
session 8 in tables L4 and L5. Table L6 and L7 in the appendix show the gain/loss ratios with
their respective means, SEs, CIs, df, and antilogs for session 7 and session 8 respectively.
Hypothesis EEG4 behaviorally measured was rejected.

112
Electrophysiological Results
The hypotheses regarding the asymmetry of gains and losses were tested electrophysiologically by measuring the amplitudes in microvolts (μV) of the ERP components
corresponding to the gain and loss events in the SubSearch game.

It was expected an asymmetry of gains and losses between 2:1 or 3:1 (EEG1), significant
differences between sessions due to a learning effect (EEG2). Table 21 shows the P100, N100,
P200, N200, and P300 means, standard errors (SEs), gain/loss ratios, and the corresponding
degrees of freedom (df), degrees of freedom numerator (dfnum), degrees of freedom
denominator(dfden), F values (F), and p values (p) of the LMM analysis. There were significant
differences for all components. The amplitude of the P300 component was 1.99 greater for losses

114
than for gains F (1, 14) = 82.81, p < 0.0001. A similar pattern was observed in all other
components. Hypothesis EEG1 measured electro physiologically was accepted.

Hypothesis EEG2
The participants played the game under identical conditions for seven sessions. I
compared the overall amplitudes and latencies for gains and losses in order to determine whether
the longitudinal data displayed an acquisition effect. It was hypothesized that differences in
ERPs corresponding to differences in the behavioral gain/loss ratio would appear with
participants’ increased exposure to the SubSearch game (for example, comparing the data from
session 1 to those from session 7) and which has been traditionally known as a learning curve.
Figure 8 displays the mean electrophysiological gain/loss ratios for the P100, N100, P200, N200,
and P300 components in each session. A visible pattern consistent with a learning curve was

117
observed for all but the P300 component. Tables N1, N2, N3, and N4 in Appendix N display the
mean amplitudes, SEs and gain/loss ratios that are summarized in Table 25.

Hypothesis EEG3
In the earlier-reported study of risk. Risk averse participants displayed significantly
higher gain/loss ratios than risk-seeking participants did. The EEG3 hypothesis predicted the
same pattern for ERP components.
Table 27 shows the mean amplitudes, SEs, gain/loss ratios, and the LMM results for risk
averse and risk-seeking participants. No significant difference was found in the P300 component
F (1, 2268) = 0, p = 0.96 or in the other components. In addition, no significant difference was
found for the P300 interaction between GainLoss and Risk F (1, 2268) = 0.22, p = 0.6421 or for the
other components.

Table 29 supplements the information of table 28 and displays the ratios of RA/RS. The
ratio in the back set of electrodes is 0.53 in the N200 suggests that processes of attention,
detection, and classification are more prevalent in risk seekers and the back electrodes (N2c) that
is thought to reflect a sub process of classification tasks reacts to a loss that is more prominent
for the risk seekers subjects.

Hypothesis EEG4
When a gain or a loss message was displayed on the monitor screen, a distinctive sound
accompanied each message. Sessions 1 to 7 included both the visual and auditory stimuli. In
session 8, only the visual stimulus was present. I hypothesized that the amplitudes of the P300
components corresponding to gains and losses would be greater in session 7 than in session 8.
Table 30 includes the overall mean amplitudes and SEs of the gain and losses in each
component for sessions 7 and 8. Though the Gain/Loss ratios were significantly different for all
components between sessions 7 and 8 and they are significant different at 0.01 level, the
predicted direction of effect did not appear for N100 nor P300. In addition, Table 30 displays the
gain/loss ratio per component and the LMM analysis for the two sessions. Table P1 in Appendix
P supplements Table 31 shows the mean amplitudes, SEs or all components that corresponds to
the gain/loss ratios of Table 31.

The ratios that appear in Table 31 were calculated by dividing the gain/loss ratios for
amplitude in session 7 by those in session 8 for the three sets of electrodes (front, middle, and
back). Tables P2, P3, and P4 display the amplitudes and ratios that were summarized in table 32.
A significant difference was found for the P300 interaction GainLoss*FrontBack*Session (p <
0.02). The overall mean Gain/Loss ratio difference for the P300 component was substantially
lower for the Back electrodes than for the other two locations. This finding suggests that the
absence of the auditory stimulus in session 8 caused a redistribution of the amplitudes, increasing
the amplitudes for the Back signals and reducing those of the Front and Middle.

Hypothesis EEG5
The event that triggered the ERP, including the P300 component, was the 1-s gain or loss
message displayed on the monitor screen. Immediately following the offset of the message, a
blinking button appeared at the bottom of the screen, indicating that the game could be resumed.
To do so, participants moved the cursor to the button and clicked. The resumption of the game
was accompanied by a distinctive ERP component that appeared similar to the original P300
component, enough so that I labeled it 2P300. It appears approximately 1300 msec following the
onset of the gain or loss message. Preceding it were components corresponding to the original
P300’s precursors Table 33 displays the overall mean amplitude of the gains and losses and
gain/loss ratios for these components and the results of the LMM analysis. Note that the

126
gain/loss ratios were nearly identical to those of the earlier-occurring components all of which
were also significant (p < 0.0001).

Table 34 displays the overall mean latencies of the second set of components for gains
and losses and the accompanying LMM analysis. Note that, like the latencies of the earlieroccurring components (see Table 23), none of gain-loss differences for the later-occurring
components were significant. The latencies of the later-occurring components (2P300 waveform)
are twice the value of the first P300 waveform.

Response time
An exploratory analysis of the response time (only in electrode O1) showed that the brain
response to a gain took 1512 msec as an average after the message was displayed on the screen.
However, it took 1665 msec when the stimulus was a loss. The response time to losses was
delayed 10% more than the response to gains. Indicating the possibility (to be confirmed in a
future study) that the brain uses more resources to process a loss than a gain.

128
Discussion
The behavior-analytic gain/loss ratios in experiment 5 were higher (3.40) than those in
the previous experiments (overall mean = 1.92). A similar differential, the electrophysiological
gain/loss ratios were also larger in experiment 5 (3.40 versus 1.99).
Considering that the experiments shared the SubSearch game, it is reasonable to conclude
that there were other factors that influenced the value of the behavioral ratio in experiment 5.
The primary difference was the use of the Emotive Epoc device to record the EEG. That its use
required additional preparation and possibly imposed discomfort during the sessions (as, for
instance, asking participants to avoid unnecessary movements so as to prevent the loss of the
Bluetooth interconnectivity or to reduce noise in the EEG) might have influenced the results.

CHAPTER 6: Conclusions
Notable aspects of the research method and data analysis include:
(a) The concurrent-operants procedure made use of six consecutive sub-conditions of
reinforcement and punishment within the same session, which is unusual. The data indicated that
participants were sensitive to the changes in conditions.
(b) The Subsearch game produced behavioral outcomes in accordance with the matching
law.
(c) The indirect model of behavior and its consequences, which was not proposed in the
literature, seems to be competitive model with other, previously used models. The model does
not take punishers into direct account in order to calculate the gain/loss ratio. Alternative
experimental designs might require a different model.
(d) The data analysis was an attempt to bridge traditional methods in behavior analysis
with commonly used inferential methods, for instance, the use of linear mixed models.
As already mentioned, normative theories of judgment and decision making posit that the
context in which a choice occurs should not affect the choice. A great deal of evidence, however,
suggests that individuals deviate from normative behavior (Kahneman, 2011). In that context, the
experiments reported here suggest that “ordinary people”, in contrast to the Econ, deviate from
the normative standard, that is, their decision making depends on the context in which it occurs.
Specifically,

153
Behavioral Measures
(e) The gain/loss ratio calculated as the mean of all of the proposed models was 2.05. For
the indirect model alone, it was 2.23.
(f) Risk seeking and risk aversion are dynamic. When internal or external conditions
change, the individual’s response to gains and losses may also change.
Internal conditions included:
(g) Gender. Women s were more sensitive to losses than men were.
(h) Risk. Risk-averse individuals were more sensitive to losses than risk seekers were.
(i) Generosity. Altruistic behavior, such as donating one’s winnings to the charity of
one’s choice, challenges the traditional view of utility theory.
Among the external conditions I studied were:
(j) Coin dispenser. Loss aversion increased when the game was played using the coin
dispenser/collector in addition to onscreen (virtual) points exchangeable for money
(k) Competition. The results suggested that risk-averse individuals became more averse
and risk seekers more inclined to take risk when given access to the anonymous outcomes of all
participants.
(l) Emotiv Epoc. The use of the Emotiv Epoc may have influenced participants’ behavior,
specifically, by increasing the gain/loss ratio. It was 3.40 when the Emotiv Epoc was used.

154
Electrophysiological Measures
(m) That brain activity was correlated with behavioral outcomes was demonstrated by the
asymmetry ratio of 1.99 for ERPs. Moreover, the Frontal electrodes recorded a faster response to
gains and losses when compared to those at the Middle and Back sites.
(n) A pattern observed in the ERP over consecutive sessions was consistent with that of
the traditional learning curve.
(o) No significant differences were found in the ERPs of risk-averse and risk-seeking
participants except for, the N200 at the interaction between GainLoss and Frontback.
(p) Visual and auditory stimuli generated higher amplitudes than did auditory stimuli
only.
(q) Mean latencies of the 2P300 component were twice those latencies of the P300.
(r) A difference in time response was found between the latencies of gains and losses. It
was larger for the losses than the gains.
