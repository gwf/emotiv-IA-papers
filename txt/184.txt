Abstract. The success of deep learning in computer vision has greatly
increased the need for annotated image datasets. We propose an EEG
(Electroencephalogram)-based image annotation system. While humans
can recognize objects in 20-200 milliseconds, the need to manually label
images results in a low annotation throughput. Our system employs brain
signals captured via a consumer EEG device to achieve an annotation
rate of up to 10 images per second. We exploit the P300 event-related
potential (ERP) signature to identify target images during a rapid serial
visual presentation (RSVP) task. We further perform unsupervised outlier removal to achieve an F1-score of 0.88 on the test set. The proposed
system does not depend on category-specific EEG signatures enabling the
annotation of any new image category without any model pre-training.

Introduction

Image annotation is a critical task in computer vision, intended to bridge the
semantic gap between automated and human understanding via the use of tags
and labels. Image annotation is useful for building large-scale retrieval systems,
organizing and managing multimedia databases, and for training deep learning
models for scene understanding. A trivial way to annotate images is to tag them
manually with the relevant labels, but this approach is slow and tedious for huge
databases. Therefore, many efforts have been undertaken to address/circumvent
this problem. Some methods are completely automatic [1,2,3,4,5], while some
others are interactive [6,7,8,9,10]– these approaches have considerably reduced
the human effort required for annotation.
Human vision is a very powerful system for object recognition and scene
understanding. It is also robust to variations in illumination, scale or pose. We
are habitually used to recognizing objects even in cluttered scenes. Humans can
identify objects in tens of milliseconds [11,12], but the representation of the
perceived information via hand movements or verbal responses for annotation is
very slow compared to the processing speed of contemporary digital devices. In
this regard, the emerging field of brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) offers us an
innovative way to exploit the power of human brain for data annotation with
minimal effort.

Brain-Computer Interfaces rely on various technologies for sensing brain activity such as Electroencephalography (EEG), MEG (Magnetoencephalography),
PET (Positron Emission Tomography), SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography), fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and fNIRS
(functional near infrared spectroscopy). Among these, EEG provides a high temporal resolution (sampling rate of up to 1 KHz) and adequate spatial resolution
(1-2 cm). In this work, we specifically use the portable and easy-to-use consumer
grade Emotiv EEG device, which enables a minimally intrusive user experience
as users perform cognitive tasks, for sensing and recording brain activity. While
having these advantages, consumer EEG devices nevertheless suffer from a high
signal-to-noise ratio, which makes subsequent data analytics challenging.
In this work, we focus on the annotation of a pre-selected object category over
the entire image dataset instead of labeling all categories at once. If the images
are presented serially in a sequence for annotation, then the task is equivalent
to that of target detection. Now whenever an image containing a target class
instance is observed by the human annotator, an event-related potential (ERP)
signature known as P300 [13] is observed in the EEG data. By examining the
EEG signals generated during image presentation, we can discover the images of
interest and annotate them accordingly. In this paper, we provide the pipeline
and architecture for image annotation via EEG signals.

Related work

The use of EEG as an additional modality for computer vision and scene understanding tasks has been explored by a number of works. In [14], EEG signals are
used to automate grab cut-based image segmentation. In [15], authors exploit
ERP signatures such as P300 for image retrieval. In [16], authors use the N400
ERP to validate tags attached to video content. Emotions from movies and ads
are inferred via EEG signals in [17] and [18].
Few studies directly use image category-based EEG signatures for recognizing
aspects related to multimedia content as well as users. For example, the authors
of [19] use EEG signals to classify images into three object categories– animals,
faces and inanimate. In a recent work [20], the authors present how EEG features can be employed for multi-class image classification. Another recent work
recognizes user gender from EEG responses to emotional faces [21]. Given the
state-of-the-art, the key contributions of our work are we how how (i) the P300
ERP signature can be employed for image annotation; (ii) the model trained for
one object category can be directly used for a novel category, and (iii) the image
presentation time affects annotation system performance for complex images.

System architecture

The proposed image annotation system consists of several components– RSVP
generation, EEG data acquisition, EEG pre-processing, (binary) classification
and outlier removal. Fig.1 presents an overview of the EEG-based annotation

pipeline. The RSVP generation unit prepares the set of images for viewing, so
that a few among those correspond to the target object category. The image
sequence is created via random sampling from the whole dataset. A human annotator is then asked to identify the target category images as the sequence is
presented rapidly, and the annotator’s brain activity is recorded via an EEG
headset during the visual recognition task. The compiled EEG data is first preprocessed for artifact removal. Then, the classification unit categorizes the EEG
responses into target and non-target annotations based on P300 patterns. Images classified as target are annotated with the target label class. However, this
labeling is noisy due to the presence of false positives and imbalance towards the
negative (non-target) class. An outlier removal unit finally performs unsupervised dimensionality reduction and clustering to improve the labeling precision.
3.1

Rapid Serial Visual Presentation and Oddball paradigm

Rapid Serial Visual Presentation is popularly used in psychophysical studies,
and involves a series of images or other stimuli types being presented to viewers
with a speed of around 10 items per second. This paradigm is basically used
to examine the characteristics pertaining to visual attention. In RSVP studies,
the oddball phenomenon [22] is widely used. In the oddball paradigm, a deviant
(target) stimulus is infrequently infused into a stream of audio/visual stimuli.
For EEG-based annotation, we generated an RSVP sequence by combing a few
target category images with many non-target images via random sampling from
the original dataset. Each image in the sequence was then shown to the viewer
for 100 ms, and a fixation cross was presented for 2 seconds at the beginning

of the sequence to minimize memory effects and to record resting state brain
activity (see Fig.4).
3.2

EEG data preprocessing and classification

We used the Emotiv EPOC headset to record EEG data. This is a 14 channels
(plus CMS/DRL references, P3/P4 locations) Au-plated dry electrode system.
For ERP analysis, the Emotiv provides signals comparable to superior lab-grade
EEG devices with 32, 64 or 128 channels. The headset uses sequential sampling
at 2048 Hz internally which is down-sampled to 128 Hz. The incoming signal is
automatically notch filtered at 50 and 60 Hz using a 5th order sinc notch filter.
The resolution of the electrical potential is 1.95 µV. The locations for the 14
channels are as per International 10-20 locations as shown in Fig.2.

Fig. 2. Sensor configuration: Emotiv electrode locations as per International 10-20
system.

The recorded EEG data is contaminated by various noise undesirable signals
that originate from outside the brain. For instance, while recording EEG, one
often encounters 50/60Hz power-line noise and artifacts caused by muscle or
eye movements. We extracted one second long epochs corresponding to each
100 ms long trial denoting the presentation of an image, with 128Hz sampling
rate. Our EEG preprocessing includes (a) baseline power removal using the 0.5
second pre-stimulus samples, (b) band-pass filtering in 0.1-45Hz frequency range,
(c) independent component analysis (ICA) to remove artifacts relating to eyeblinks, and eye and muscle movements. Muscle movement artifacts in EEG are
mainly concentrated between 40-100 Hz. While most artifacts are removed upon
EEG band-limiting, the remaining are removed manually via inspection of ICA
components.
The human brain’s response to a stimulus can be measured as a voltage
fluctuation resulting from the ionic current within the neurons. The event-related
potential is one such measure that is directly related to some motor, cognitive
or sensory activation. Out of various ERP components, the P300 signature is

Fig. 3. ERP plots: ERP curves for the Emotiv af3, af4, f3 and f4 channels for target
(red) and not-target (blue) images. P300 signatures are evident for targets but not for
non-targets.

commonly elicited in the oddball paradigm where very few targets are mixed
with a large number of non-targets. In our experimental setup, we employed a
1:12 ratio for target-to-non-target images. As shown in Fig.3, the P300 ERP
signature is observed between 250 to 500 ms post target stimulus presentation.
Also, the ERP response is significantly different for target and non-target images,
and therefore can be exploited for EEG-based image annotation.
We used the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based EEGNet architecture [23] to classify our EEG data based on P300 detection in the RSVP task.
The EEGnet architecture consists of only three convolutional layers. All layers
use the Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) [24] as nonlinear activation function with
parameter α = 1. We trained the model using the minibatch gradient descent
algorithm with categorical cross-entropy criterion and Adam optimizer [25]. The
models were trained on a NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 1080 Ti GPU, with CUDA
8 and cuDNN v6 using the Pytorch [26] based Braindecode [27] library.
3.3

Outlier removal

We select one category at a time for the annotation task, which results in class
imbalance for the RSVP task. The selected object category forms the target class,
while all other categories collectively form the non-target class. Due to this heavy
class imbalance and the characteristics of P300 as discussed in Section 5, the false
positive rate of the predicted labels is high. Therefore we performed unsupervised outlier removal on the predicted target images. Deep learning features have
proven advantages over hand-crafted features like SIFT and HoG [28]. We used a
pre-trained VGG-19 model [29] to obtain the feature descriptors for the targets.

These feature descriptors provide compact representation of raw images while
preserving the information required to distinguish between image classes. Each
target image was fed forwarded within the VGG-19 model to obtain the 4096 dimensional feature vectors. Target images need not belong to the image classes on
which the model is pre-trained. Then, we perform dimensionality reduction with
t-SNE [30] to generate low-dimensional features. The t-SNE algorithm retains
the local structure of the data while also revealing some important global structure, and hence it performs better than principal component analysis (PCA)
alone.
In our case, we assume that samples from the target class should be close in
feature space as compared to non-target samples. By performing a grid search
on hyper-parameters, we found that the algorithm works best with perplexity
value 20, 50 PCA components and 3-5 output dimensions. Then, we performed
k -means clustering for two classes assuming that target class samples will form
a cluster distinct from the false positives. Also, since the false positive cluster
would contain samples from many categories, the cluster would not be as dense
as the target cluster.

Protocol design and Experiments
Datasets

To evaluate the performance of our image annotation system, we used the Caltech101 (CT) [31] and Pascal VOC2012 (PV) [32] datasets. The CT dataset
consists of 101 object categories with 40 to 800 images per category. The PV
dataset contains a total of 11,530 images from 20 categories, and multiple object
categories can be present in one image.
4.2

Experimental setup

We utilized 2500 images for training, and 2500 images for testing. Both these
image sets comprised 200 images of a particular target category that we wanted
to annotate. All images were resized 512×512 pixels, and images were displayed
at 10 Hz frequency in blocks of 100 in order to minimize viewer distraction and
fatigue. During the RSVP task, participants were shown a fixation display for 2
seconds at the beginning of each 100 image sequence. Train and test EEG data
were captured using an identical experimental setup with the temporal gap of 5
minutes. Target image categories were decided a priori before every experiment.
Our study was conducted with five graduate students (5 male, age 24.4 ±
2.1) with 10/20 corrected vision, seated at a distance of 60 cm from the display.
A total of three sessions (each involving train and test set) were performed with
each participant. To facilitate engagement, viewers were instructed to count
the number of target images during the experiment. Target image classes were
different for each session, and included categories like bike, pizza, panda, sofa,
etc. Each participant performed two sessions on the CT dataset and one session
on the PV dataset.

Fig. 4. Experimental protocol: Participants completed two identical sessions (one
used for training and the other for test) which were 5 minutes apart. Each session
comprised 25 blocks of 100 images, and lasted about six minutes.

Results and Discussion

Due to a heavy class imbalance between target and non-target category images,
we use the F1-score to evaluate our annotation results. The F1-score is a popular
performance metric used in retrieval studies, and denotes the harmonic mean of
the precision and recall scores. All reported results denote the mean F1 achieved
with five-fold cross validation.

After outliers removal

In Table 1, we report the averaged F1 and precision-recall values for the
CT and PV datasets across all participants. Note that the precision and F1

scores improve significantly upon outlier removal due to a stark reduction in the
number of false positives via feature-based clustering. Overall F1 scores for the
PV dataset are lower than for the CT dataset. This can be attributed to the
fact that the PV dataset is more complex, as it contains multiple object classes
in many images, as compared to CT which contains only one object class per
image.
As our annotation system is dependent on viewer ability, its performance
is sensitive to human factors. One key factor is the image presentation rate.
The image display latency (100 ms) is lower than the P300 response latency (≈
300 ms) [33]. The rapid image display protocol results in (i) viewers confusing
between similar object classes, (ii) viewers unable to fully comprehend visual
information from complex images, and (iii) EEG data for consecutive images
having significant overlap leading to misclassification.
Therefore, we hypothesized that reducing the image display rate would (a)
allow the viewer to better comprehend the visual content (especially for complex
images), (b) better delineation of EEG responses, and (c) better manifestation
of ERP signatures. These in turn, would improve our annotation performance
while marginally reducing the annotation throughput. Fig.5 presents the observed results. Note that a 3% increase in F1-score is observed when the image
presentation rate is reduced from 10 to 4 images/second, validating our hypothesis.

Fig. 5. Presentation rate vs annotation performance: Variation in F1-score with
image display rate.

Conversely, since our annotation system is solely based on P300 signatures
which are task specific but target class agnostic. Therefore, it is not mandatory
to train the EEGNet with object class-specific EEG responses. To validate this
aspect, we trained and tested the EEGNet with EEG responses corresponding
to different object categories. Table 2 presents the F1 scores achieved for the five
viewers with class-agnostic train and test EEG data. Note that only a marginal
difference in annotation performance is noticeable with class-specific and classagnostic EEG data across viewers. Since we are using the pre-trained VGG-19

model exclusively to extract feature descriptors, it can be used without further
fine tuning for any new target class categories.

Conclusion

In order to facilitate large-scale image annotation efforts for computer vision
and scene understanding applications, we propose an EEG-based fast image
annotation system. Our annotation system exclusively relies on the P300 ERP
signature, which is elicited upon the viewer detecting a pre-specified object class
in the displayed image. A further outlier removal procedure based on binary
feature-based clustering significantly improves annotation performance.
Overall, our system achieves a peak F1-score of 0.88 with a 10 Hz annotation
throughput. Another advantage of our method is that the P300 signature is specific to the target detection task, but not the underlying object class.Therefore,
any novel image category can be annotated with existing models upon compiling
the viewer EEG responses. Future work will focus on discovering and exploiting
object-specific EEG signatures, and combining multiple human responses (e.g.,
EEG plus eye movements) for fine-grained object annotation and classification.
