Abstract— Although human cognition often occurs while moving,
most studies of the dynamics of the human brain examine
subjects while static and seated in a highly controlled laboratory.
EEG signals have been considered to be too noisy to record brain
dynamics during human locomotion. Here, we present a real-time
ambulatory brain computer interface which allows us to detect
gait phases and remove motion-related artifacts from EEG
signals during walking in real-world environments. We first
construct stride-based artifact templates employing a gyroscope
to measure the angular velocity of the human body. Then, we
apply an adaptive Kalman filter to estimate the mapping between
the stride-based artifact template and EEG space, subtracting the
motion-related noise from the raw EEG signal. This study
demonstrates the robustness of our system to remove gait-related
movement artifacts during human locomotion. Experiments in
real-world environments show the potential practicality of reallife applications of low-cost wearable and wireless BCI systems
for users actively working in and interacting with their
environments.

INTRODUCTION

Building mobile electroencephalogram (EEG)-based braincomputer interfaces (BCIs) to record human electrocortical
brain dynamics in noninvasive ways while moving could have
far-reaching benefits for various real-life applications. These
applications include home entertainment as well as clinical
monitoring, assessment and rehabilitation [1]. Thus,
understanding the natural translation from human behaviors to
EEG dynamics is considered to be the key point for researching
and developing the practical applicability of mobile BCIs [2].
However, one of the challenging issues is that the mechanical
artifacts in EEG signals, associated with head movements
during locomotion, can have an amplitude that is an order of
magnitude larger than the underlying brain-related EEG signals
[3]. To measure brain dynamics during locomotion, additional
information is required to combat the reduced level of
measurement and therefore control. Recently, locomotionbased mobile BCI technologies have shown its efficacy during
walking and running [4, 5, 6]. The main idea of these
technologies is based on electrocortical activity that is coupled
to the gait cycle phase [7]. However, most of these studies have

been limited to highly-controlled laboratory environments such
as walking on a treadmill [5, 6]. Unfortunately, applying these
technologies in real-world environments cannot be carried out
easily because the speed and length of a human's stride are vary
in real-world environments. In this paper, we present a realtime ambulatory BCI system to enable recording of brain
dynamics reliably during human locomotion in a real-world
environment. The proposed system aims to remove motionrelated artifacts adaptively under various circumstances so that
the quality of the recovered EEG signal is comparable to the
EEG signal recorded in a static, seated, or highly controlled
situation. Our system is stride-based, where freely moving
human strides are detected automatically so as to recognize
how much EEG signals are contaminated during locomotion.
To best of our knowledge, detecting human gait phases
automatically under real-world scenarios has not been fully
explored for ambulatory BCI applications. Therefore, the
contribution of the proposed system, as an alternative to
existing work, is a new, effective system that addresses the
limitations of the previous systems in a single system:
1. Ambulatory BCI system - The quality of EEG signals
during locomotion can be recovered enough to be
comparable to EEG signals obtained in statically
seated or prone conditions.
2. Automatic gait phase detection - Human strides are
automatically detected when standing or walking in a
real-world environment. Stride information such as
length and speed provides critical clues to construct
motion-related artifact templates.
3. Adaptive motion-related artifact removal - The
proposed adaptive filtering method takes advantage
of motion information to estimate the motion artifact
noise. This filter is capable of removing motion
artifacts, restoring EEG signals
The key technical challenge in designing the proposed
system was the development of a motion-related artifacts
removal algorithm that addresses the following requirements.
First, the algorithm must have the ability to continuously detect
the following gait phases: stance, heel-off, swing, and heelstrike in real time [8]. We employed a gyroscope to measure
the 3-axis angular velocity of the body and associate the
magnitude of the angular velocity with the gait phases. Using a

developed under the Android SDK and implemented on a
Google Nexus 5.

gyroscope is ideal because it can measure how much the
human body has swayed until one gait phase is finished in real
time. Second, due to possible subject motion and changes in
electrode impedance, a time-varying mapping of the motion
versus EEG is required. Our adaptive filtering algorithm is
based on the Kalman filter algorithm [9]. The adaptive
algorithm makes use of any correlation between the motion
signal and the observed signal to remove the noise signal.

B. Independent component analysis
ICA is a great technique to estimating statistically
independent components (ICs) from signal mixtures. It has
been widely applied to multichannel EEG signals to remove
artifact signals and thus improve the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) of EEG signals. In this study, we adopted the Fast ICA
algorithm based an implementation in C++ [13] to decompose
the 14-channel EEG signals into 10 components that
distinctively modulate for the SSVEP and P300 BCI protocols.
ICA finds an unmixing matrix, W, that linearly separates the
time series data into an independent source matrix, U, by
minimizing the mutual information among the output
components, followed by the equation of U=WX. The rows of
output data matrix, U, are the component activations. To
remove artifact components, some ICs that have large
punctuate activations or have a spectral peak above 20Hz are
abandoned and considered to be related to eye movement.
C. The stride-based movement artifact template

We experimented with two BCI protocols: steady-state
visual-evoked potential (SSVEP) and event related potential
(P300). To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of our
system while walking for the two BCI protocols, this study
instructed participants to stand, walk around, and go up and
down stairs in a building at their natural pace for eliciting
different degrees of head/body movements while subjects were
performing visual tasks. We demonstrate how the proposed
system can serve as a platform for mobile BCIs by evaluating
the two filtered protocols through on- and offline analysis in
terms of accuracy and SNR.

PROPOSED SYSTEM

Fig. 1 shows the overview of our entire system. The proposed
system consists of mainly three parts; acquisition of EEG data,
construction of stride-based movement artifact templates, and
removal of motion-related noise in an adaptive way. Each part
is described below.
A. Experiment setup and EEG data acquisition
Five healthy participants (5 males; 23-35 years of age;
mean age: 29 years) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision
participated in this experiment. Written informed consent was
obtained from each participant. This study adopted a 16channel mobile EEG system (Emotiv Epoc, US) featuring a
low-cost wearable device and wireless data transmission to
record signals with a sampling rate of 128 Hz [10]. All
electrodes were used and placed over the frontal, parietal, and
occipital areas in order to record SSVEP and P300 signals.
From a 3-axis gyroscope built into the Emotiv Epoc, angular
velocity values were also. Subjects were asked to stand, walk
around, go up and down stairs in a building at their natural pace
for 5 minutes while conducting visual tasks. The visual task of
SSVEP was to gaze at a blank and white flickering stimulus of
12 Hz or 15 Hz [11]. The visual task of P300 was to conduct
This work was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the

(2013R1A1A2009378).

Figure 2. Overview of the stride-based movement artifact template

Fig. 2 shows the overview to construct the stride-based
movement artifact templates. Based on the [8], sagittal plane of
rotational rate (deg/s) is minimized at the heel-off stage,
maximized at the middle of the swing stage, and increased
again until the heel-strike stage. Motivated by this, we employ
a gyroscope to measure the 3-axis angular velocity of the body
and associate the magnitude of the angular velocity with the
gait phases. Given the current timestamp tc, the magnitude of 3axis gyroscope data points vector Gm during its past tc - tp are
collected. From the Gm, a pair of local minimum and maximum
values is assigned as the sagittal plane of absolute rotational
value at the heel-off and the mid-swing stage in a stride and
their respective timestamps are assigned as the timestamp of
the heel-off to and the timestamp of the mid-swing tmid.
Assuming the length between the heel-off and the mid-swing is
same as the length between the mid-swing and the heel-strike
stage, timestamps of the heel-strike stage is assigned as tstrike
which is 2tmid - toff. Finding a pair of minimum and maximum
value is conducted successively in time sequence and when the
search is finished, we have a stride vector Stp {S1 ,..., Si ,..., S n }
where Si = { toff, tmid , tstrike}. Given Si, EEG signals are collected
from toff to tstrike. At the last step, the collected EEG signals are
averaged so called stride-based movement artifact template.
D. Adaptive Motion Noise Cancellation
We model the recorded EEG signal y(t) as the sum of a
"true" underlying EEG signal s(t) and a signal n(t) containing
motion-related noise,


y(t)=s(t)+n(t) 

The relationship between the noise signal n(t) and the stridebased template m(t) is modeled linearly using a time-varying,
finite impulse response (FIR) kernel wt(k) with the equation

where N is the order of the FIR kernel. An adaptive filtering
algorithm is used to produce an estimate of the FIR kernel
wt(k), which is in turn used to estimate the noise signal n(t).
The estimated noise signal is then subtracted from the recorded
signal y(t) to reveal the underlying EEG signal s(t),

the true underlying EEG signal s(t) is uncorrelated with the
motion signal m(t), the adaptive algorithm does not affect it,
and on average the result of the noise cancellation process
sˆ(t ) will be the true underlying EEG.
E. Support Vector Machine
Support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is known to a
good solution for generalization and has been used for EEGbased classification [14]. Although SSVEP-based BCIs have
largely adopted canonical correlation analysis (CCA) due to its
ability to improve the SNR of SSVEPs, in this study the
proposed system did not adopt CCA because we aim to
develop an algorithm to work with several BCI protocols such
as P300 and sensorimotor rhythms. The proposed system
applies the linear kernel-based SVM. For robust classification
during real-time execution, data points passed to SVM with 1s
time window with 500ms increment.

EXPERMIMENTAL RESULTS

We evaluated the efficacy of our proposed system for
removing motion-related noise in terms of accuracy and SNR.

in accuracy were happened between sitting in a laboratory and
walking around a building (averaged 14.4% and 14.8%

CONCLUSION

This study focused on measuring human strides and using
the information to remove motion-related artifact for improving
BCI detectability in freely-moving humans in real-world
environments. Through employing a gyroscope to measure the
angular velocity of the human body and applying an adaptive
Kalman filter to subtract the motion-related noise from the raw
EEG signal, we demonstrated the practicality of real-life
applications of mobile and wireless BCI systems for users
actively working in and interacting with their environments.

increased for SSVEP and P300 respectively). This results have
similar tendency with previous work [5, 6]. On the other hand,
all results obtained from the proposed system achieved
statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05). Furthermore,
the results show the proposed system recovered its robustness
with respect to accuracy comparable to the result obtained in
seated condition. The proposed system restored contaminated
EEG data up to 93%. Fig. 3 and 4 illustrate the averaged
SSVEP and P300 SNR in response to each visual flickering (12
Hz and 15 Hz) and visual evoking. Similarly as the detection
accuracies, our proposed system achieved statistically
significant improvements (p < 0.05). The SNR was defined as
the ratio of the amplitude of the SSVEP and P300 to the mean
power at adjacent frequencies or times. For example, in the
