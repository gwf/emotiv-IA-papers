Open Access

Music therapy as social skill intervention for
children with comorbid ASD and ID: study
protocol for a randomized controlled trial
Yen Na Yum* , Way Kwok-Wai Lau, Kean Poon and Fuk Chuen Ho

Abstract
Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental impairment characterized by persistent deficits in
social communication and interactions, and over half of children with ASD possess below average intellectual ability
(IQ < 85). The social development and response to social skill interventions among children with ASD and comorbid
intellectual disability (ID) is not well understood. Music therapy is a systematic process of intervention, wherein a
therapist may help clients promote their social skills by using musical experience. The proposed study will address
limited research evidence on music therapy as an intervention for social functioning in children with ASD with mild
to borderline ID.
Method: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel groups of 40 children each (1:1 allocation ratio) is
planned. Participants will receive 45 min of music therapy or non-musical intervention targeting social skills once a
week for 12 weeks. Primary outcome measures will be independent ratings on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale
and parent ratings on the Social Responsiveness Scale-2. Linear mixed-effects models for these two outcome
measures will be created for data collected at 2-week pre-intervention, 2-week post-intervention, and 4-month
post-intervention sessions. In-session behaviors at the first and last intervention will be videotaped and coded
offline and compared. Pretreatment neural response of quantitative electroencephalograms (qEEG) to social scenes
will be used to predict the outcomes of musical and non-musical social skill interventions, whereas qEEG responses
to music will be used to predict the effectiveness of musical social skill intervention.
Discussion: If neural markers of social skill development are found, then the long-term goal is to develop
individualized intervention based on pre-treatment markers to maximize treatment efficacy. The proposed study’s
results may also suggest directions to development and provision of music therapy services in Hong Kong.
Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04557488). Registered September 21, 2020.

Background
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental impairment characterized by persistent deficits in social
communication and interactions coupled with restricted
and repetitive patterns of behaviors. The symptoms of
ASD appear in early childhood. The prevalence of

childhood ASD in the Greater China Region is 26.6 per
10,000 children [1], but the figures have increased rapidly in recent years due to the expansion of diagnostic
criteria and increased public awareness. Given that no
known cure or effective pharmacological intervention
for ASD is available, behavioral interventions that target
autism symptoms is the main strategy to support individuals with ASD to be integrated into school and the
society. Intervention studies typically target the core social deficits in ASD, including low inclination for human

interactions, lack of social skills, and impairments in
interpersonal communication. Social skill training may
cover a myriad of social behavior, including initiating
interaction, responding, maintaining eye contact, using
appropriate co-speech gestures, and conversational turntaking. Training for high-level social cognition may
involve understanding non-literal language, perspective
taking, and recognizing emotions [2].
Although high-functioning ASD individuals do not
tend to naturally comprehend social conventions, they
can follow established rules and imitate modeled social
behavior. However, the effectiveness of explicit social
skill training may not generalize to low-functioning
school-aged children with ASD. Explicit training is likely
to be less effective for children with severe autistic
symptoms who actively avoid social interactions or who
may demonstrate limited intellectual ability. The clinical
presentations of ASD vary to a large extent, and approximately 56% of children with ASD possess below average
intellectual ability (IQ < 85) [3]. The intellectual, verbal,
and social ability in this population may greatly influence
intervention outcomes. The social development of
children with ASD and comorbid intellectual disability
(ID) is not well understood, and systematic investigations on how children with ASD and ID respond to
social skill interventions remains to be done.
Use of music in social skill intervention

The choice to examine music in social skill intervention
is motivated by accruing evidence of its potential for
therapeutic use for various clinical populations [4]. The
use of music in ASD intervention is quite common.
Background music may be used to increase familiarity
and relaxation, whereas active music activities can provide a point of contact between instructors and children
with ASD, thereby helping to build rapport and promote
learning through non-verbal interactions [4, 5]. However, music therapy as social skill intervention for lowfunctioning ASD individuals have not been comprehensively examined. For ASD intervention, music has been
explored as a medium to increase social skills in the field
of music therapy for some years [5]. Music therapy is
defined as a systematic process of intervention, wherein
a therapist helps clients promote their health by using
musical experience and relationships that develop
through them [6]. Children with ASD and ID are often
described as preoccupied in their own world and may be
highly passive or unresponsive in social situations. The
low verbal ability of these children is one limitation to
their participation given that social interactions often
involve verbal exchanges. Music may become a conduit
for children whose natural affinity to social interactions
is impaired because group music making and improvisations encourage initiation and turn-taking behavior in a

Page 2 of 10

non-verbal situation. In group music therapy, children
with ASD can learn to tolerate the presence of and physical contact with other people, distinguish between oneself and others, and practice social behavior [5, 6].
A Cochrane review in 2014 analyzed behavioral data
from 10 RCT studies comparing music therapy with
non-musical placebo therapy or standard care [7]. The
results demonstrated moderate-quality evidence supporting the effectiveness of music therapy in improving
social interactions and initiating behavior, social adaptation, and parent–child relationship. No adverse effects
have been reported. Although flaws in study designs and
low numbers of participants in some studies have precluded strong conclusions, available evidence indicates
that music therapy improves social–emotional reciprocity and verbal and nonverbal communicative skills
outside the context of therapy. By contrast, a recent
large-scale multicenter RCT study on music therapy for
364 children with ASD aged 4–7 years has found no significant differences in social skills compared with standard care as measured by clinical observations or parental
ratings [8]. These mixed findings may be due to the
heterogeneity of the studies, which involved children
belonging to different age groups, abilities, and living in
different countries. Long-term outcomes are also unclear
in these studies. Since effectiveness of clinical interventions is influenced by social and cultural contexts [6],
previous studies must be replicated and extended to
obtain locally relevant data. The proposed study will
contribute to a clear evidence base that serve to inform
and develop music therapy in social skill interventions
for children with ASD and ID in Hong Kong.
Prediction of treatment success

One hypothesis that has not been tested in previous
studies is that success in social skill interventions may
depend on individual differences. Autistic symptoms and
abilities vary widely among children with ASD, arising
both from different developmental speeds and specific
interests. Some individuals may possess deficits in the
areas of restricted interests or repetitive behavior, which
results in poor social skills; however, they are accepting
of social interactions. The willingness to seek out social
experiences is the foundation to social skill development
because without initial interests in social behavior, the
motivation to attend to the explicit training and modeling is low. In such cases of social avoidance, cultivation
of social interests through other strategies, such as music
making, may be more effective. Narrowing down the
characteristics of children who respond well to a particular type of intervention can facilitate timely and efficient
treatment provision. To build the foundation for an
evidence-based strategy for individualizing treatment
plans, research should explore markers that indicate

Yum et al. BMC Pediatrics

(2020) 20:545

responsiveness to interventions. In this study, we
propose to test quantitative electroencephalogram
(qEEG) signals in response to music and social scenes as
predictive measures of treatment outcomes.
Spontaneous electrophysiological neural activities at
rest or when engaged in task can be measured by
qEEG. Spectral analysis is used to decompose qEEG
signals across several minutes into different frequency
bands, which are associated with specific functions.
The most consistent pattern of findings in the literature is that individuals with ASD show a U-shaped
pattern of spectral power relative to controls without
ASD [9]; that is, excessive power is observed at lowfrequency (delta, 1-3 Hz and theta, 4–7 Hz) and highfrequency (beta, 13-35 Hz and gamma, > 35 Hz) bands,
but reduced power is detected in middle-range frequency band (alpha, 8-12 Hz). The pattern was found
with wide topographic distribution, which suggested
abnormalities across multiple brain regions. This finding was reported for children in different age groups
and for individuals with or without comorbid ID.
High-frequency bands have been associated with emotional responses and emotion recognition and may be
linked to such deficits in individuals with ASD.
Neural patterns that deviate from age-matched controls to a greater extent may suggest more severe
behavioral symptoms.
Frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) is typically investigated in relation to emotional response and motivations,
both in clinical and normal populations [10]. Leftlateralized or left-dominant brain activity has been
linked to an approach system where an individual experiences positive emotions and motivations. In contrast,
right-lateralized frontal activity may reflect negative
emotions and intention to withdraw. Reduced alpha
power in the left frontal area of the scalp in individuals
with ASD has also been reported [9]. The modulation of
FAA has been demonstrated in neurofeedback training
in individuals with ASD to activate their imitation
behaviors [11, 12], so this measure is hypothesized to
predict and be responsive to social skill interventions.
High-functioning individuals with ASD show intact
emotional processing when listening to music, although
they demonstrate distinct neural patterns relative to
neurotypical adults, which is interpreted as increased
cognitive load and physiological arousal [13]. Individual
preference for music varies within the target group with
ASD and ID and may predict how they respond to social
skill intervention using music therapy. Although selfreport rating scales exist for reporting music experience
and preference, qEEG measures may be superior because
they index automatic responses to musical stimuli that
the target population of children with ASD and ID may
find difficult to understand or express.

The proposed study will address the research gap on
music therapy as an intervention for social functioning
in children with ASD with mild to borderline ID. The
research design is to examine whether using music therapy as social skill intervention provides additional benefits relative to non-musical active control behavioral
intervention in a 12-week RCT. We will also evaluate
whether pre-treatment neural response to music is
correlated with the effectiveness of musical social skill
intervention. If correlation is found, then the long-term
goal is to develop individualized intervention based on
pre-treatment markers to maximize treatment efficacy.

On the group level, is social skill intervention using
music therapy more effective in enhancing social
interaction than non-musical social skill training for
children with ASD and co-occurring mild/borderline ID?
On the individual level, are participants with
enhanced left-lateralized FAA to social scenes relative to baseline more responsive to both types of
social skill interventions?
For participants in the music therapy intervention,
does enhanced left-lateralized FAA to preferred
music relative to baseline predict better outcomes
in social skill development?

Methods/design
Study design

The proposed study will be a randomized controlled trial
with two parallel groups. Recruited children will first be
screened for eligibility and then matched into pairs by
age and gender by a research assistant. Another research
assistant will assign individuals in each pair to the treatment group (social skill intervention with music) or control group (non-musical social skill intervention) using
random number sequences. Participants in the same
condition will then be separated into groups of eight by
drawing lots. The research assistants performing participant matching and randomization will not be involved
in data collection or outcome assessments. The pre-tests
and post-tests will include (i) childhood autism rating
scale-second edition (CARS-2) rated by an independent
rater, (ii) social responsiveness scale-second edition
(SRS-2) rated by parents, and (iii) EEG recording. Pretests will be administered 2 weeks before intervention,
while post-tests will be administered 2 weeks and 4
months after intervention. In each intervention week for
12 weeks, the participants will undergo one 45 min session of social skill training. Within each condition, the
same trainer will be responsible for all sessions to

Yum et al. BMC Pediatrics

(2020) 20:545

minimize differences in intervention delivery across
groups. The intervention sessions will be videotaped,
and social behavior in the first and last sessions will be
coded offline. Figure 1 shows an overview of the study
design. Should protocol modifications become necessary,
the amendments will be communicated to relevant parties, including research personnel, intervention trainers,
participants and their parents, the trial registry, the journal that published the study protocol, and the funding
body.

intervention or standard care controls [7]. For a twogroup t statistics with α = 0.05, power = 0.8, and attrition rate = 25%, a minimum number of 33 participants
in each group will likely yield statistically meaningful
differences. Given that neural measures can detect
autonomic responses and behavioral intentions in
addition to explicit actions, they can be considered
more change sensitive than behavioral observations.
Hence, we expect that recruiting 40 participants in each
group will allow us to detect presence of effects in
qEEG measures.

Participants

A total of 80 primary school aged children (aged 6–13
years) with ASD and mild/borderline ID will be
recruited from various sources, including local special
schools, music therapy centers, parent groups, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Hong Kong. A
research assistant will obtain written informed consent
and oral assent from parents and participants, respectively, before participants enroll into the interventions.
Participants and their families’ personal information will
be kept strictly confidential and stored securely. Participants and families will receive interventions free of
charge and stipends for transportation to the intervention and assessment sites. Participants will also be given
souvenirs after pre- and post-intervention assessments
as incentives.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The inclusion criteria include a formal clinical diagnosis
of ASD and an assessed overall and verbal IQ of 50–84
by a certified clinician. Children who report hypersensitivity to sounds will be included with consent but will be
withdrawn immediately if adverse reactions that cannot
be controlled (e.g., screaming, attempts at self-harm) are
observed. Intervention trainers, assistants, or parents of
participants will be encouraged to report any adverse
events to facilitate timely response.
Children who exhibit severe physical or sensory disabilities (e.g., deafness) that may limit their participation
in either intervention will be excluded. Children with
other neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, or neurological
comorbidities or are on prescribed psychiatric medication will also be excluded from the study. Children who
already engage in music therapy or other social skill
interventions (excluding standard care) will be ineligible
to enroll in the study.
Sample size calculation

The sample size was calculated based on the predicted
effect size of 0.71 in generalized social interaction outside intervention context from a meta-analysis of social
skill intervention studies using music therapy for children with ASD (aged 2–12) relative to non-music

Interventions
Treatment group intervention

Trainers and participants The treatment group will
receive social skill intervention using music therapy in
groups of eight. A certified music therapist with prior
experience with children with ASD and ID will be the
trainer for the treatment group. Parents or primary caregivers will be invited to attend the intervention sessions
and to observe the training. An assistant trainer will also
be present in all sessions to facilitate the group activities,
manage unexpected situations, and ensure the safety of
the participants.
Schedule and setting The intervention will be delivered
one session per week over a 12-week period. The sessions are 45 min in duration and are designed to be
short because children with ASD and ID tend to exhibit
a short attention span. The location will either be at a
special schools or NGO in Hong Kong.
Session structure Each session will follow a similar
structure with a hello song, musical activities, and a
goodbye song. The musical activities will vary in each
session and will be mixed in later sessions to revisit and
practice social skills [6].
Intervention contents and target skills
Session 1–2: Familiarize the participants with the
surroundings and other participants and the music
therapy session structure using visual display; introduce
the hello and goodbye songs
Sessions 3–4: Increase vocalization and verbal use by
song singing of familiar songs and social songs
Sessions 5–6: Encourage communication of choice,
sharing, and social interaction by selecting, using, and
exchanging musical instruments
Sessions 7–8: Emphasize group participation and
sending and receiving social cues by group drumming
and music making, and other coordinated movements
during songs

Fig. 1 Study design and participant enrolment

Page 5 of 10

Yum et al. BMC Pediatrics

(2020) 20:545

Sessions 9–10: Increase initiation, response, and turntaking by free or structured improvisations of vocal and
instrumental music
Session 11–12: Review and reinforce past musical
activities, appreciate and reward improvements,
forewarn the end of intervention sessions
Emphasis of approach The trainer will typically focus
on building a relationship with the participants, understanding their current levels of functioning, and choosing musical activities that may scaffold their social
development.
Control group intervention

Trainers and participants The control group will
receive behavioral-based social skill training in groups of
eight. The trainer will be a registered social worker with
experience in providing social skill training for children
with ASD and ID. Parents or the primary caregivers will
be invited to attend the intervention sessions and to
observe the training. An assistant trainer will also be
present in all sessions to provide support.
Schedule and setting The intervention schedule will
closely follow the treatment group’s schedule, with one
45-min session per week for 12 weeks. The location will
either be at a special school or NGO in Hong Kong,
using the same venue if feasible.
Session structure Each intervention session will follow
a standard structure of opening greetings, social activities according to the theme of the session, and a closing
activity. The activities and games will vary in each session and will be mixed in later session to revisit and
practice social skills [14].
Intervention contents and target skills
Session 1–2: Familiarize the participants with the
surroundings and other participants and the
intervention session structure using visual display;
introduce greetings and gestures when meeting new
people and making friends via visual and video
modeling
Sessions 3–4: Increase vocalization and verbal use by
playing pair and group games and small craft projects
that require collaboration and communication
Sessions 5–6: Encourage communication of choice,
sharing, and social interaction by reading social stories
and playing cooperative games
Sessions 7–8: Emphasize group participation and
sending and receiving social cues by role-play; exercises
in recognizing emotions and display of appropriate
emotions and behaviors in different daily settings

Page 6 of 10

Sessions 9–10: Increase initiation, response, eye
contact, and turn-taking in conversation by explicit
instructions or demonstrations, small group practice
with feedback
Session 11–12: Review and reinforce past activities and
taught social skills, appreciate and reward
improvements, forewarn the end of intervention
sessions.
Emphasis of approach Focus is typically on explicit and
concrete instructions, reinforcing good social habits, and
fostering positive associations for group interactions.
Musical activities will be excluded in this control condition to contrast the specific effects of music therapy in
intervention. This type of group training is typically
offered by schools or NGOs in Hong Kong for children
with ASD with or without ID, and may be considered as
a standard practice control condition relative to music
therapy targeting social skills.
Assessment of treatment fidelity

Before intervention commences, the intervention manual
will be shared with the trainers to facilitate their preparation and delivery of intervention. All materials and procedures that have been developed will be clearly
described and explained in pre-intervention meetings
with trainers. Adherence to the protocol and trainer
competence will be directly assessed by the recorded
video data and by independent review of the intervention session notes. The inter-trainer reliability and evaluation of treatment integrity will be reported in the
outcomes. Participants will be asked for reasons for discontinuation or deviation from intervention protocols.
Outcome measures
Primary outcomes

The primary outcome measure is autistic severity as
assessed using a standardized rating scale by an independent rater who will be blinded to the study group
allocation. This outcome was selected because observing
behavioral changes that generalize to other social contexts outside of the intervention is the ultimate goal of
social skill intervention. Parental rating by using a standardized rating scale is included as another outcome to
support the clinical assessment. Parents are good informants because they spend time with the participants
outside of intervention contexts, but they are not
blinded to the group assignment and may exhibit
expectation biases. Another outcome is the behavioral
changes at the last intervention sessions relative to the
first session. Trained research assistants who are blinded
to the session number and study hypotheses will code
for target social behaviors by using video data. This
measurement will provide an objective measure of the

Yum et al. BMC Pediatrics

(2020) 20:545

social skills exhibited by participants within the intervention setting.
CARS-2 The general autistic symptoms of the participants will be assessed using CARS-2 [15], by a qualified
and experienced assessor. This scale consists of 15 questions rating the autistic symptoms and general impression of deviance based on behavioral observations. Each
question is rated from 1 to 4, and high scores are associated with a high level of impairment. Scores below 30
indicate that an individual does not have ASD, scores
between 30 and 36.5 imply mild to moderate autism,
and scores from 37 to 60 correspond to severe autism.
The psychometrics of CARS-2 is well documented in
Western and Chinese contexts [15, 16].
SRS-2 Parental ratings of generalized social interaction
outcomes will be collected using SRS-2. A parent of each
participant will be asked to complete the SRS-2 based
on their observations of their child over the previous 3
months. The scale is a 65-item questionnaire that measures the severity of social impairments associated with
ASD [17]. The five subscales include social awareness,
social cognition, social motivation, social communication, and autistic mannerisms. Each item is rated on a
scale from “0” (never true) to “3” (almost always true),
and high scores indicate severe social impairments. SRS2 exhibits good psychometric properties in Western and
Chinese contexts and is sensitive to changes in social
functioning among children with ASD [17, 18].
In-session social behavior The intervention sessions in
the treatment and control groups will be videotaped
using a high-resolution video camera, and data from the
first and last sessions will be coded for target social
behavior. The three main types of behavior, namely, initiation, turn taking, and eye contact, will be examined
using a microanalysis of video recordings in one-second
intervals [19]. Target social skills were selected based on
the expected types of behavior that may occur during
the sessions and that are essential for effective social
interactions. The frequency and duration of the social
behavior will be recorded with the following coding
scheme. Initiation includes touching a person, making a
verbal request, giving an object to a person, and other
actions to get another’s attention. Turn taking includes
responding within an appropriate time either verbally or
non-verbally and not interrupting out of turn. Eye
contact includes directing the gaze toward the person
speaking or acting. The behavior will be further categorized as instructor-to-participant social interactions or
participant-to-participant social interactions. Inter-rater
reliability will be determined in 20% of coding. These
behavioral outcomes are important indices of how much

Page 7 of 10

and how appropriately children engage in social interactions. Video data from each session will also be used to
indicate the amount of explicit instruction (talking time
of the trainer) and amount of music use, to validate the
fidelity of the interventions. These data may be included
as covariates in data analyses if they are significantly
different across groups.

Secondary outcomes

EEG will be recorded using Epoc X (EMOTIV) researchgrade EEG headsets with 14 channels digitized at 256
Hz. This tool is a child-friendly wireless mobile EEG system that is easy to apply with non-sticky saline-based
wet sensors and has high research quality [16]. The data
collection will be conducted by research assistants who
are blinded to the participants’ group assignment.
Recording will be performed in three conditions, namely,
resting state, social scenes, and preferred music, for 5
min each. For the baseline resting state condition, data
will be recorded with participants at rest, passively viewing an animation of moving shapes without sound.
Although resting-state qEEG in adults is usually measured without explicit sensory stimulation, a simple
viewing task is used here because it will be difficult for
children to sit still without anything to hold their attention [16]. For the social scene condition, participants will
view typical scenes where children or adults interact in
school and playground without sound. For the preferred
music condition, the participants will listen to their preferred music with eyes opened and fixated on a cross on
a computer screen.
To determine the music preference of participants, a
brief selection task of 25 different music pieces and genres will be administered, based on a task adapted from
previous research reporting a five-factor music preference model called MUSIC [20]. Each music excerpt will
be 15 s long, and participants will indicate their preference for each piece based on a 5-point pictorial scale.
The dominant music style will be calculated for each
participant and 5 min of preferred music pieces will be
played to obtain neural responses to music in the pretest and post-tests.
EEG segments free of artifacts will be selected, and
spectrum decomposition will be carried out. Absolute
and relative power levels in different frequency bands
(alpha, beta, delta, gamma, and theta) will be calculated
in each condition. FAA index will be calculated by subtracting the alpha frequency power from left and right
frontal electrodes. The difference in FAA in the social
scenes and baseline will be used as a predictor in data
modeling in treatment and control groups. The FAA in
preferred music condition will be correlated with treatment effectiveness in the treatment group only.

Statistical analyses

Interim analyses will not be performed and data collection will continue until the intended sample size is
reached. The investigators and research assistants will
have full access to the final trial dataset. Analyses will
focus on hypothesis-driven testing with separate models
for each outcome measure by using linear mixed effect
modeling if the assumptions for linear effects are met
[21]. This regression-based statistical test can be used to
evaluate multiple categorical and continuous predictors,
and eliminates the need to run multiple tests for different hypotheses, which inflates the risk for type I error.
Attrition bias will be assessed by comparing the participant completion rate in the two conditions and considering the reasons. Mixed effect models are robust with
missing or extreme values, which is useful if the attrition
rate for the 12-week intervention is higher than
expected. Fixed effect predictors will be intervention
type (music/non-music), time (pre−/post-intervention),
and pre-treatment EEG frontal asymmetry (social and
music). The random effects of participants and groups
will be included to estimate random errors arising from
individual differences in participants and group trainers.
Control factors will include overall and verbal IQ, age,
and ASD severity. The inclusion of these covariates alleviates concerns on unreliable effects due to the heterogeneity of children with ASD and ID.

Discussion
In Hong Kong, a government policy was in place where
special schools were provided with additional funding
from the Education Bureau to run the Resource Teaching Program for children with low-functioning ASD.
This program was particularly designed for those students with comorbid ID and ASD to receive enhanced
support in addition to normal classroom teaching. The
program was delivered in the form of individual or small
group intervention, in-class support and follow up intervention [22]. If the results of the proposed study are
positive and mechanisms in which music can promote
social behaviors can be identified, then music can be a
low-cost and scalable method to integrate social skill
intervention in specific programs, regular school curricula, or as after-school activities.
Critically, if pre-treatment neural markers can help
identify appropriate intervention plans, then application
of this result will greatly improve the efficiency of treatment and educational provision for this population. EEG
data can be collected with low-cost, commercially available products and take only 5–10 min to set up. Children with ASD and ID are only required to sit still for a
few minutes because no explicit task response is needed.
With the relative ease of data collection, this procedure
may be included in routine clinical check-ups. The

Page 8 of 10

analyses of these data can help researchers and clinicians
to understand how neural responses in children with
ASD and ID are related to the clinical presentation of
their social deficits. Such data may be further compared
with those of neurotypical children to elucidate the
mechanisms of social functioning and to improve social
skill interventions. Individualized help in social skills for
at-risk school-aged children may reduce cases of bullying
and increase the likelihood of inclusion into the society.
Downstream benefits may include increased success in
securing and maintaining jobs and increased mental
health for individuals and their caregivers.
The current lack of treatment standards has often led
to confusion and stress for families with children with
ASD. Public intervention services for children with ASD
are not widely available and private services are expensive. In 2020, the Jumpstart program at Autism Partnership, the primary organization providing intensive ABA
intervention for individuals with ASD in Hong Kong,
cost HK$86,900 for 5 days of individual ABA therapy
[23]. The Accelerate Program, which was delivered in
small groups, was priced at HK$128,000 per month [23].
The Sparks program, which was a low-cost alternative of
one-on-one therapy with relatively inexperienced therapists, still cost HK$32,500 per month [24]. For reference,
the median household monthly income in Hong Kong in
the second quarter of 2020 was HK$25,500 [25]. Given
the cost considerations, some families may abandon
treatment if the method is not effective in a short period
of time. Prediction of treatment success may solve an
urgent issue for families with children with ASD because
the window for early intensive intervention is small, and
the costs for different types of interventions are high. A
weekly group-based music therapy session as described
in this study costs approximately $500 per month. If
music therapy is a reliable option to improve social outcomes in certain individuals with ASD and ID, then it
may be a more cost effective alternative than intensive
behavioral therapy.
The proposed study’s results may suggest directions to
manpower planning and provision of services in Hong
Kong, which may include policymaking and development of education and training programs at local tertiary
institutions. Musical intervention in Hong Kong is
increasing in popularity relative to other places that
already routinely use music therapy in allied health professions. Practicing music therapists in Hong Kong
mostly received training from Australia, Canada, the UK,
or the USA. Although specialized clinical training and
professional regulations are needed for music therapy
practice, no local institution provides training that will
lead to a recognized music therapist status, and no
licensing organization exists in Hong Kong. If empirical
data support the use of music therapy to increase social

Yum et al. BMC Pediatrics

(2020) 20:545

skills in children with ASD and ID, then the development and training of professionals to engage in such
evidence-based practice may be particularly beneficial
for Hong Kong.
Findings will be disseminated through presentations at
scientific conferences, meetings for local practicing professionals in special education, and knowledge exchange
seminars for the public and families of individuals with
