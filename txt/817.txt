ABSTRACT
Blinking and eye movement are one of the most important abilities that most people have, even people
with spinal cord problem. By using this ability these people could handle some of their activities such as
moving their wheelchair without the help of others. One of the most important fields in Human-Robot
Interaction is the development of artificial limbs working with brain signals. The purpose of this project
consists in detecting blinking and left and right eye movements via electroencephalogram signals which is
also useful in determining sleepiness. Moving Window, Fast Fourier Transform and Wavelet Transform are
the methods which are used in this project. Obtained results reveal that the most reliable method to recognize
blinking and eye movements is Fast Fourier Transform since it is almost insensitive and invariant to the
defined variables. After recognition of blinking and eye movement, these actions are transferred to a robot
which is called the spherical 2-DOFparallel robot, built first at the Laval University.

1. INTRODUCTION
Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is a field of study
dedicated to understanding, designing and evaluating
robotic systems to interact with humans. HRI has
stimulated a considerable attention in several laboratories
and technology companies. In fact, the HRI research aims
at defining models of human’s expectation regarding robot
interaction to guide robot design and algorithmic
development that would allow more natural and effective
interaction between humans and robots [1]. HRI could
also be also used in rehabilitation for helping disable
people to experience a better life.
Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a record of the brain
electrical activity. It could be recorded by placing
electrodes on the scalp. By processing these signals, many
useful information from brain activities could be
extracted. Recently, several tools and implements have
been built for recording EEG signals and this can be
exemplified by a large number of commercialized EEG
signal recorders. Emotive headset [2] is one of them
which is used in this study. There are some noises in EEG
signals which are produced by body movement. For
instance, blinking and eye movement produce some
signals which are called electrooculogram (EOG). EOG is
the resting potential, generated by an electric dipole, is
formed by a positive cornea and a negative cornea [3].
EOG is considered as a noise in EEG signals.
Sleepiness is an important problem in driving or for
people working with dangerous devices and it further
could be identified by blinking recognition. When they
feel sleepiness, their eyelid is closed for a time longer than
when it is closed and opened in usual blinking or the
speed of closing their eyelid is longer than the speed of
usual blinking. By using these features, the blinking is
recognized and by producing a loud sound or other ways
they can be warned.
Several studies have been conducted with the aim of
recognition of blinking artifacts from EEG signals. In [4]
and [5], different methods to extract blinking from EEG
signals have been compared. In [6] and [7], a neural
network classifier specialized in eye blink identification
from EEG signals has been developed. Power spectrum
analysis to extract EEG eye blinking artifacts is performed
in [8]. In [9], slow eye movement and subjective
estimation of sleepiness via EEG power changes during
sleep deprivation are considered.
Blinking is a spontaneous action. It is produced due to
stretching of tendons and ligaments of the orbicularis
oculi and levator muscles [10]. During this action, some

56

A. Arian, A. Kalhor and M. Tale-Masouleh

signals which are changed in the electrical potential
between the cornea and the ocular are produced which is
called electrooculogram [11].
Belkacem in [12] proposes a simple algorithm for
offline recognition of four directions of eye movement
from EEG signals. A hierarchical classification algorithm
is developed using a thresholding method. A strategy
without a prior model is employed to distinguish the four
cardinal directions and a single trial is used to make a
decision. One of the most important variables of this
action is the blinking period. Sleepiness can be identified
when the blinking period is longer than usual. Recognition
of sleepiness is very important especially in driving.
Blinking and eye movements have many artifacts in
EEG signals, especially in signals extracted from the front
part of the head. Artifacts are noises which exist in EEG
signals. Recognition of blinking and eye movement are
possible by processing and analyzing these signals.
The aim of this study is to recognize blinking and eye
movement by the aforementioned methods and
transferring them to a 2-DOF spherical parallel robot to
simulate them on the robot.
As the main contribution of this paper, three methods
to identify blinking and eye movement in EEG signals are
introduced. The first method consists in a reliable straight
forward method referred to as Moving Window. In
addition, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Wavelet
Transform methods will be discussed. Then these three
methods will be compared so that the most promising
approach is fully reached.
As it can be seen from Fig. 1, the under-study robot
[13] is a 2-DOF spherical parallel robot, which makes this
robot an appropriate choice for simulating human eye
movements [14]. When two blinks occur within 3 seconds
the robot will rotate 30 degrees upward, and if three blinks
occur in the same interval it will result in 30 degrees
downward. Moreover, when the eye moves to the left
(right), the robot will move 30 degrees to the left (right).
The overall insight of this project is shown in Fig. 2.In this
paper, only the methods for recognition of blinking are
explained. The methods for the recognition of moving eye
to the left and right are the same. However, the difference
between these signals and how it will be recognizedwill be
explained later.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
will explain data acquisition. Section 3 will go through the
methods which are used to recognize the blinking in EEG
signals. In Section 4, experimental results obtained from
these three methods are discussed. Section 5 explains how

left and right eye movement will be recognized. Finally, in
Section 6, an overall conclusion is proposed and some
future research directions are outlined.

evaluate the precision of the proposed algorithm with
respect to speed of eye movement. After gathering data,
these signals were processed in order to recognize eye
movement and blinking.

Fig. 3. Emotiv headset [13]

Fig. 1. The spherical 2-DOF parallel robot

From the first practical tests, it reveals that the effect
of blinking on EEG signals in front part of the head is
more impressive. Therefore, by using data which are
gathered from front channels of this headset, named F7
and F8 in international 10-20 system [15], and upon
processing these signals, recognition of blinking is
performed, which is the subject of what follows.
3. METHODS FOR BLINKING RECOGNITION
After gathering data, these signals will be processed
with different methods and blinking is recognized from
EEG signals. It is obvious from Fig. 4 that effect of
blinking and eye movement on EEG signals coming from
the front part of scalp is considerably high with respect to
other signals. Therefore, even after smoothing these
signals the blinking signal is analogous.

Emotiv headset is installed on the head and transfers the data to the
2-DOF parallel robot
2. DATA ACQUISITION
In this paper, for blinking recognition, as the first step,
EEG signals are gathered from an Emotiv headset (Fig. 3)
which gives raw data of brain activity. Emotiv headset has
16 bio-potential sensors with gold- plated connectors offer
optimal positioning for accurate spatial resolution. This
headset has dry sensors. The connection between these
sensors and the head is by saline solution. Before putting
these sensors on their place, they should be properly
wetted with saline solution.
For gathering EEG signals, 10 subjects were selected
with normal vision. The subjects were seated in front of a
monitor located approximately 50 cm away at eye level.
The subjects are asked to follow the green ball in each
direction or blink when its color changed to red. Also, the
tests have been done with different ball speeds in order to

A. Moving Window
As aforementioned, the effect of eye movement and
blinking on EEG signals is considerably high and it could
be detected even after smoothing the signals. So, as the
first step the signals are filtered to remove minor effects of
57

other noises on the signal. For this purpose, these signals
are smoothed out with a rectangular method which
contains a window with a specified length. In Fig. 5, it is
shown that when the signal is smoothed, the part of signal
in which blinking is happened has a greater amplitude
than the other part of the signal.

happened. Thus, by choosing appropriate values for length
and threshold blinking could be recognized properly.
Algorithm 1 presents the general pseudo-code for the
implemented Moving Window in which “ le ” stands for
the number of samples in the signal and “s” is the data
which is sent by Emotiv headset. “
” is defined in
order to show when blinking is happened, when blinking
is recognized “
” changes to 1 and when it is not
recognized it becomes 0 (Fig. 6-lower graph). In turn, “t”
is the threshold that by repeating the tests could be found
and “ lw ” is the length of the window that is defined later.
In Fig. 6, the result of using the above algorithm, when

t = 2 and lw = 30 is shown.

Fig. 5. The first shows a Signal which blinking has been occurred
three times and the second graph shows that signal after it has been
smoothed with a rectangular with length of 30
In order to determine blinking, in this part, a moving
window with a specified length and threshold is used. The
signal is scanned by the window which is shown in Fig.
4.During this process, the window moves forward through
the signal. The window goes one unit ahead in each step
and the mean value of these selected parts of the signal
(by the window) is calculated.

In order to identify blinking in EEG signals, the mean
values are compared to the threshold. If the mean value
becomes larger than the threshold, then the blinking is

As mentioned earlier, “ ” is the mean value of the
window. It is obvious from the algorithm that each time
the window goes ahead the mean value,
, is calculated
and is compared with the threshold, t .
B. Fast Fourier Transformation
The second method used in this project is the so-called
Fast Fourier Transformation. In mathematics, the Discrete
Fourier Transform (DFT) is a kind of transformation that
deals with a finite discrete-time signal and a finite or
discrete number of frequencies. DFT is equivalent to the
continuous Fourier transform for signals known only at
instants separated by a sample time (T), i.e., a finite
sequence of data. Let f (t) be a continuous signal which is
the source of the data and N samples be denoted by f [0], f
[1], …, f[k], …, f[N-1].
One can regard each sample f[k] as an impulse having
area f[k]. Then, since the integrand exists only at the
sample points, the Fourier Transform of the original
signal, would be:

FFT is an algorithm in order to compute DFT and its
inverse. An FFT rapidly computes such transformations
by factorizing the DFT matrix into a product of sparse
(mostly zero) factors [16]. By using FFT, time is
converted into frequency; therefore, the objective is
finding blinking in EEG signals by converting time to
frequency. As the first step, a window with “ le ” as length
is defined and in each step the window goes forward by
one unit. After using FFT on the given part of signal and
computing the corresponding absolute values, the mean
value is computed. Then the window goes ahead and this
process is repeated for all the windows.

As noted before, “s” is the data obtained from the
headset, “ le ” is the number of samples in the signal, and
“sig” is the part of the signal which is selected by the
window. For using FFT on the signal, a window with
length of “ lw ” is defined, and “x” which is FFT of “sig” is
computed. Then, the absolute value of “x” which is named
“ xa ” is calculated. Similar to Moving Window method,
the window goes ahead one unit and the mean value of the
selected part of the signal is calculated which is named “f”
in ALGORITHM 2 and it is compared with the threshold.
If it is greater than the threshold, the blinking will occur.
Fig. 7 presents the result after applying FFT on the signal
shown in Fig.5 is demonstrated.

C. Wavelet Transform
The Wavelet transform is the mapping of a time signal
to the time-scale joint representation which is similar to
the short-time Fourier transform. The wavelet transform
provides multiresolution analysis with dilated window.
The high frequency analysis is performed using narrow
windows and the low frequency analysis is done using
wide windows [17].
Wavelet transform is easier when one uses MATLAB
programming. Applying Wavelet transform on the signal
in MATLAB requires just to use a simple command
which is “wavedec”.

In wavedec(Signal,N,’wname’), “Signal” is the
signal which is used, “wname” is the name of
specific wavelet and the command decomposes the
signal at level N (N should be a positive number). In
this study N=1.
4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Recognition of blinking is performed by implementing
the foregoing three methods, namely, Moving Window,
FFT, and Wavelet transform. However, there are other
tests which have been carried out, including the effects of
color changing and eye movement on EEG signals. In this
part, different methods will be discussed and Correct
Classification Rate (CCR) for each of them will be
reported to show the accuracy of each method.
A. Moving Window
The blinking signal magnitude is more than the
amplitude of the other artifacts in EEG. Therefore, the
threshold is variable and it varies from 0.5 to 8. The
obtained results reveal that blinking can be identified
when the length of the window changes in the range of 10
to 100. But if the length of the window becomes less than
the minimum value of its range, blinking may be

identified even when it has not happened. In addition, if
the length of the window exceeds from the maximum
value, blinking will not be identified. Blinking period is
not constant and it may vary in different situations. For
instance, in sleepiness, the blinking period becomes
longer. This method can identify blinking with different
periods by choosing appropriate values for the threshold
and the length of the window.
In Fig. 8, the Moving Window method with 3 different
lengths of windows,

lw = {10, 20, 70}, and with a constant

threshold, 4, have been shown. It is obvious that when the
length of window increases considerably, the blinking
cannot be identified properly. In Table 1, the results of
using different thresholds and different lengths in Moving
Window Method to recognize blinking are shown. In this
paper, the threshold is used her since the diffidence
between the signal amplitude when blinking is happened
and when it is not happened is too much.

conditions, CCR for the Moving Window method
becomes 100%.
B. Fast Fourier Transform
In FFT, after changing the signal from time to
frequency, by selecting a suitable length for the window
and the threshold, blinking could be readily recognized.
But similar to the other methods, the length of window
changes in the range of 10 to 100 and the threshold lies in
the range of 100 to 250. However, repeating the test
shows that the best length for the window is 20 and an
appropriate threshold for determine blinking is 90. In
Table 2, the results of using different length and the
threshold for recognizing blinking are reported. From this
table it can be inferred that the FFT method is a reliable
method since it is insensitive to the defined variables. Fig.
9 illustrates how the graph of frequency changes
accordingly when the length of the window changes and it
becomes more complicated to recognize blinking.

As shown in Table 1, this method is sensitive to little

that blinking can be well recognized when the threshold is

By using the FFT method with threshold of 90 and a
window with the length of 20, CCR of this method
becomes 100%.
C. Wavelet Transform
Wavelet transforms are a mathematical means for
performing signal analysis when signal frequency varies
over time. For certain classes of signals and images,
wavelet analysis provides more precise information about
signal data than other signal analysis techniques.
In Fig. 9, the results of using wavelet transform on the
existing signal when N = 1 is shown which recognizes
blinking with a small rise of signal amplitude around
80thsample. By using a suitable threshold, blinking has
been detected. As it can be observed from Fig. 9, a
suitable threshold is 6000. By using this threshold, onecan
detect blinking with CCR=87.5%.

5. RECOGNIZING EYE MOVEMENT
Similar to the procedure performed to detect blinking,
the left and right movement of the eyes can be recognized.
The method is explained as follows.
The signals of three actions of blinking, moving eyes
to left and moving to right obtained from channelF7 and
F8 are shown in Fig. 10(a), it can be seen, blinking has a
similar effect on both channels. On the other hand, left
and right movement of the eye has a reverse effect on the
channels. For instance, left movement of the eyes results
in a sharp increase in signal obtained from channel F7 and
sharp decrease in signal obtained from channel F8 (see
Fig. 10(b)). Fig. 11(c) shows the opposite effect for the
right movement of the eyes.

monitoring the signals obtained from F7 and F8 channels.
After using the aforementioned methods on a given signal,
for recognizing eye movement or blinking, these two
signals which are gathered from two channels of the
headset are compared with each other. In this way, one
can easily find the action with CCR=100.

6. CONCLUSION
In this paper, spontaneous eye blinking detection was
investigated based on three methods, namely, moving
window, Fast Fourier transform and Wavelet transform.
The challenge consisted of finding a suitable length for the
window and, then, computing the mean values of the
selected data in order to identify the blinking. Thus
determining a suitable length for the window and also an
appropriate threshold is really important. If the threshold
is selected appropriately the blinking is recognized
properly. By changing the threshold and the length of the
window blinking was recognized which was resistant to
the length of the window and the threshold. In order to
obtain a suitable value for the length of the window and
the threshold, several tests based on a trial and error
approach were performed. Then by sending the data to the
robot the blinking was simulated. As ongoing studies,
more tests are being performed on recognition of blinking
during eye movements. In addition, some experiments will
be designed in order to detect the direction of eye
movements to the up or down from EEG signals.
Accomplishing the latter procedure, the obtained results
will be used as the controller’s input in the movement of
the Spherical 2-DOF parallel robot.
