Abstract: Steady-state visual evoked response (SSVEP) is widely used in visual-based diagnosis and applications such as brain–computer interfacing
due to its high information transfer rate and the capability to activate commands through simple gaze control. However, one major impediment in using
ﬂashing visual stimulus to obtain SSVEP is eye fatigue that prevents continued long-term use preventing practical deployment. This combined with the
difﬁculty in establishing precise pulse-width modulation (PWM) that results in poorer accuracy warrants the development of appropriate approach to
solve these issues. Various studies have suggested the usage of high frequencies of visual stimulus to reduce the visual fatigue for the user but this results
in poor response performance. Here, the authors study the use of extremely high duty-cycles in the stimulus in the hope of solving these constraints.
Electroencephalogram data was recorded with PWM duty-cycles of 50–95% generated by a precise custom-made light-emitting diode hardware and
tested ten subjects responded that increasing duty-cycles had less visual strain for all the frequency values and the SSVEP exhibited a subject-independent peak response for duty-cycle of 85%. This could pave the way for increased usage of SSVEP for practical applications.

Introduction

Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is elicited in the brain
when a user attentively gazes at a visual stimulus ﬂashing at a
constant frequency. SSVEP is a periodic response generated in
the occipital region of the brain when the user focuses on a ﬂashing
visual stimulus and would have the same frequency as the presented
visual stimulus [1]. SSVEP is widely used in academic and clinical
research studies due to the minimal amount of training required and
also as it allows a higher signal-to-noise ratio [2–4]. SSVEP-based
electroencephalogram (EEG) responses are used in medical diagnosis for investigating visual perceptions, user attention or brain
responses to identify any symptoms or other medical conditions
[5]. Researchers have also explored SSVEP application in
emotion and electrophysiological study to explore the face inversion effect and the N170 potential [6, 7]. Studies have also explored
the application of SSVEP responses for infants in investigating
visual acuity and cortical functions [8, 9]. SSVEP uses nonmuscular communication channel and that makes it widely
acceptable in brain–computer interface (BCI) applications, where
it can support people with disabilities to control external application
with multiple visual stimuli [10–13]. Other form of BCIs includes
hybrid versions, which combines paradigms such as P300, visual or
audio to improve the accuracy and efﬁciency in BCI operations
[14–16]. Fig. 1 shows an EEG data acquisition and processing
block diagram for an SSVEP-based system.
SSVEP is a repetitive response generated in the brain and is synchronised with the frequency of the visual stimulus. To produce an
accurate response, the stimulus ﬂicker frequency must be precise
and consistent throughout the period the user is focusing.
Traditionally, SSVEP is evoked using ﬂickers produced with
liquid crystal display (LCD) screens in which the ﬂicker frequencies
are limited to the refresh rate of the LCD [17–19]. For a standard
LCD screen, the refresh rate is ﬁxed at 60 Hz and the frequencies
that can be generated are 6.66 Hz (i.e. 9 fps, 60/9), 7.5, 8.57, 10,
12 and 15 Hz. It is not possible to generate any other required frequency such as 7, 8 or 9 Hz or choose high duty-cycles of the visual
ﬂicker due to the ﬁxed refresh rate of the screen. Gazing the visual
stimulus on an LCD screen for longer periods of time can make the

user tired due to visual fatigue not only from the ﬂashing objects on
screen but also from the ﬂicker generated by the screen itself which
can reduce the SSVEP response. Even though the eye strain can be
reduced by using higher-frequency ﬂickers, it reduces the SSVEP
amplitudes resulting in weaker responses. On the other hand,
SSVEP responses are higher for lower-frequency ranges but
would introduce visual fatigue for prolonged usage [20, 21].
Studies have used light-emitting diode (LED)-based visual
stimulus designs that can produce visual ﬂickers without any
frequency restrictions and can also produce multiple visual
stimuli using the same control platform [22, 23]. When using
multiple visual stimuli ﬂashing at different frequencies, the accuracy
of the ﬂicker frequency for visual stimulus plays an important role
in SSVEP-based BCI. Even though the frequency restriction is
resolved with LED usage, the visual fatigue and user comfortability
are still cause for concern. To mitigate these issues, this paper uses a
visual stimulus hardware based on LEDs which is capable of
producing any frequency visual ﬂicker with adjustable duty-cycle
using pulse-width modulation. Duty-cycle can be deﬁned as



Duty-cycle = TON / TON + TOFF × 100%

(1)

where TON is the stimulus on period and TOFF is the period when
there is no stimulus.
Fig. 2 shows a square-wave with ON and OFF periods marked
within a complete cycle. In Fig. 3, examples of square-wave
based on various duty-cycles that are used in this paper are shown.
LED-based visual stimulus used in almost all SSVEP studies have
used a duty-cycle of 50% with an equal ON/OFF period for the
ﬂicker. This when gazed for longer periods of time would cause
eye fatigue and lowers the attention and reduces the SSVEP response.
In this paper, different duty-cycles of 50, 80, 85, 90 and 95% are analysed in conjunction with lower frequencies of 7, 8, 9 and 10 Hz for
reduced visual fatigue and user comfortability.

Methods

In this research, EEG acquisition system based on Emotiv EPOC+,
which is a wireless headset with 14 channels, was used to record the

EEG for SSVEP analysis. The EEG data was transmitted wirelessly
to the computer by using proprietary communication protocol
which monitored the packet loss and electrode contact quality in
real time. The raw data acquired was stored in the computer and
processed to analyse the SSVEP frequency responses for various
duty-cycles. The visual stimulus design was based on
chip-on-board (COB) LED in radial form with a diameter of 130
mm emitting green light. COB LEDs form a much denser array
producing uniform light and reduce attention shifts. The precise
ﬂicker frequencies generated were 7, 8, 9 and 10 Hz using microcontroller with accuracy of ±0.1 Hz which were conﬁrmed at the
LED terminals using an oscilloscope. The microcontroller used
was based on Teensy development platform which is a 32 bit
ARM-based controller and can generate precise square-waves
with higher degree of accuracy. This standalone visual stimulus
platform could generate any desired frequency with the required
duty-cycle which is not possible with traditional LCD screens.
For each chosen frequency, the microcontroller was programmed
for different duty-cycles 50, 80, 85, 90 and 95% with an accuracy
of ±0.1% conﬁrmed with the oscilloscope. Fig. 4 shows a snapshot
of the generated square-wave information with 85% duty-cycle.
The radial LED was controlled by the microcontroller using a
metal–oxide–semiconductor ﬁeld-effect transistor (MOSFET)
driver for constant brightness throughout the experiment. The complete system was powered by a 5 V direct current (DC) source from
a battery pack to avoid any mains power line interference while

recording the EEG. The EEG responses from all the chosen
frequencies and ﬁve different duty-cycles were compared and
analysed to identify the duty-cycle value that gave the highest response. The experiment also obtained the ratings for the comfort
level of the visual stimulus for all the frequency ranges with different duty-cycles.
To explore the inﬂuence of duty-cycle in visual ﬂickers, ten
participants with perfect or corrected vision within an age group
of 25–46 (four females and six males) were chosen for this
paper. Participants did not have any prior experience with BCI or
any other visual stimulus-based studies. The participants were
comfortably seated 60 cm from the visual stimulus which was
placed at eye level. Written consents from the participants were
obtained after brieﬁng them on the objectives of this paper.
Ethical approval was received from Faculty of Sciences Ethics
Committee at University of Kent.
The EEG was recorded using Emotiv EPOC+ research edition
with 14 electrodes, though only data from a single electrode
located at O2 was used in this paper (as SSVEP is maximal in
occipital cortex). The visual stimulus was programmed with the
desired frequency and duty-cycle to evoke the SSVEP for a
period of 30 s for each trial. Each frequency and duty-cycle had

ﬁve such trials of 30 s for each participant. The EEG headset was
prepared with saline soaked felts on all 14 electrodes and positioned
on participant’s head. The contact quality was veriﬁed and the position of the electrodes adjusted to ensure all good contacts using the
Emotiv test bench software. EEG recording started with 7 Hz with a
randomly chosen duty-cycle for a period of 30 s for ﬁve trials followed by other remaining duty-cycles chosen randomly with ﬁve
trials for the same frequency with 30 s duration. The trials were
repeated for 8, 9 and 10 Hz for the same duration and for the ﬁve
different duty-cycles. Between each 30 s recording session, the participants were given a short break of 1 min to allow any previous
stimuli inﬂuences to subside. For each participant, the total
number of trials was 100 for four frequencies and ﬁve duty-cycle
values repeated ﬁve times.
2.1 Hardware design to generate visual stimulus
The visual stimulus for this paper was designed using a green COB
LED ring with a diameter of 130 mm. The colour and the radial size
were chosen based on previous studies which identiﬁed the highest

performance in terms of SSVEP response [20, 24]. The LED ring
consists of 156 individual COB LED’s densely packed producing
a uniform circular green light. The ring was controlled by a 32 bit
microcontroller based on Teensy 3.2 development platform. The
microcontroller was based on ARM Cortex M4 family which
operates at 72 MHz and can generate precise frequencies and
duty-cycles. The code for the microcontroller was developed
using Arduino software development platform which is easily
customisable for any frequency or duty-cycle. The desired visual
ﬂicker and duty-cycle were programmed in the microcontroller
and the LED was driven through a MOSFET driver to supply the
required current for ensuring the constant brightness throughout
the experiment. The microcontroller code has to be individually
loaded in the microcontroller for each experiment for all the
required frequencies and duty-cycles. The hardware platform was
powered by a 5 V DC battery pack with 5000 mA current capacity
to ensure the steady supply of power to the visual stimulus. Fig. 5
shows the schematic block diagram for the hardware design.
2.2 EEG data acquisition and processing
The EEG data was recorded using Emotiv EPOC+ research edition
headset with 14 channels and two reference electrodes with the
layout as shown in Fig. 6. In this paper, to identify the best dutycycle for the visual stimulus, only data channel from channel O2
was used for all the different frequency and duty-cycle combinations. Data channel O2 was used since it is in the occipital region
and has the maximal response for SSVEP according to various
studies [25, 26]. The EEG was recorded in European Data Format
(EDF) using Emotiv test bench software for 30 s trials with a

sampling frequency of 128 Hz which was ﬁxed in the hardware but
sufﬁcient to avoid aliasing as our highest EEG stimulus frequency
was only 10 Hz. Each participant had a total recording time of about
50 min (100 trials lasting for 30 s) excluding the rest times of 1 min
each between the trials. The recorded data in EDF format for
channel O2 was converted to MATLAB format for ofﬂine analysis
using EEGLAB [27].
The 30 s of EEG data was saved as individual ﬁles and ﬁltered
using band-pass ﬁlter of 2 Hz bandwidth with centre frequency as
the stimulus frequency and segmented into 1 s EEG segments.
The ﬁve trials recorded for each session had 150 segments of 1 s
SSVEP EEG data which was analysed using fast Fourier transform
(FFT) and the maximum FFT amplitudes stored from each segment
for further statistical analysis. Kruskal–Wallis (Normality of data
was not established, hence the use of rank-based approaches.) test
was used to identify signiﬁcance of the difference inﬂuences of
duty-cycles in SSVEP. The analysis was performed on maximal
FFT amplitudes of EEG data for all ﬁve duty-cycles to identify
the most responsive.

Results

Fig. 8 Maximal FFT amplitude values from ten participants at 8 Hz

This paper investigated the visual stimulus performance with ﬁve
different duty-cycles 50, 80, 85, 90 and 95% to compare the
SSVEP responses. All the mentioned duty-cycles were analysed
for four frequencies 7, 8, 9 and 10 Hz using the COB LED radial
visual stimulus. The analysis compared the data from ten participants
for identifying the most comfortable and responsive duty-cycle
value in all the frequency ranges. For each data set, there were
150 amplitude FFT values for each frequency and duty-cycle from
one participant. Each participant had 20 sets of data which included
four frequencies and ﬁve duty-cycle values using the same LED
visual stimulus. Figs. 7–10 show the box plots for the obtained
FFT amplitudes for different duty-cycles and frequencies 7, 8, 9
and 10 Hz. Each box plot data consists of combined 1500 values
from ten subjects (rather than individual subjects due to space
constraints) with same duty-cycle value and with same visual
stimulus frequency. The central line in the box shows the median
value while the edges of the box are at 25 and 75th percentiles
with the whisker values not being displayed. The Kruskal–Wallis
tests, χ 2(df = 4; N = 1500) shows signiﬁcant differences between

5.3 × 1003 with all the signiﬁcance p-values very close to zero.
Table 1 shows the mean ranks for all the different duty-cycles for
ten subjects with four different frequencies. The mean ranks were
individually computed for each frequency with different duty-cycle
to analyse the inﬂuence of duty-cycle in SSVEP response. It can be
observed that for all the subjects, the 85% duty-cycle gave the
highest performance as compared with other duty-cycles. The
SSVEP responses decreased after 85% duty-cycle even though
the participants reported an increase in comfortability. The lowest
SSVEP response was from 95% duty-cycle in all frequency ranges.
This paper also explored the level of comfortability for the users
with different duty-cycles in all frequency ranges. A scale of 1–10
(10 being the most comfortable) was used for comparing the stimulus
comfort with reduced visual fatigue for different duty-cycles. The participant response is shown as a bar graph in Fig. 11. Even though 90
and 95% duty-cycle shows the highest comfortability value, the
SSVEP responses were less as compared with the responses from
85% duty-cycle. It is also known that the visual fatigue level also

reduces with the increase in duty-cycle for visual stimulus. With
85% duty-cycle, even though the visual fatigue level (measured here
with subject’s comfortability rating) was more compared with higher
duty-cycle, the SSVEP evoked had the maximal response and hence
85% duty-cycle is recommended for the visual stimulus.

Discussion

This paper has investigated the inﬂuence of different duty-cycle values
in visual stimulus in eliciting SSVEP in brain for reducing visual
fatigue and improving the comfortability of the user while giving
improved response. The results were compared for frequencies 7, 8,
9 and 10 Hz with duty-cycle values of 50, 80, 85, 90 and 95%. The
results show that there is an inﬂuence of duty-cycle in SSVEP
responses which also agrees to previous studies [28, 29]. The data analysed for ten participants showed that the stimulus with 85% exhibited
the highest response with minimal visual fatigue. The participants
commented that they were able to gaze attentively for longer periods
without discomfort producing better SSVEP responses. The dutycycles above 85% showed a decrease in the SSVEP response that

could likely be due to the very small TOFF period which might appear
to the human eye to be constant light rather than ﬂicker.
All the participants felt there was improvement in comfortability
to focus on visual stimulus when the duty-cycle increased as the
stimulus was ‘ON’ for longer periods as compared with the conventional 50% ON/OFF duty-cycle which produces eye strain for
prolonged usage. Furthermore, the use of various higher dutycycles would also help in presenting multiple visual stimuli for
classiﬁcation purposes suited for BCI applications. Each stimulus
could be customised with different duty-cycle values to override
the inﬂuence of adjacent stimulus in multi-stimuli conﬁguration
using lower frequencies that are more inﬂuential for SSVEP.
Further studies could explore the development of user adaptive dutycycle where the stimulus hardware could automatically change the
duty-cycle based on the real-time feedback from EEG response.
