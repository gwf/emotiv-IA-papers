Functional Connectivity and Classification of
Actual and Imaginary Motor Movement
Nilima Salankar, Anjali Mishra, Pratikshya Mishra
Abstract— Imaginary Motor movement is an utmost
important for the designing of brain computer interface to assist
the individual with physically disability. Brain signals associated
with actual motor movement include the signal for muscle
activity whereas in case of imaginary motor movement actual
muscle movement is not present .Authors have investigated the
similarity/dissimilarity between the eeg signals generated in both
the cases along with the baseline activity. To instruct the brain
computer interface signals generated by electrodes of EEG must
resemble with actual motor movement. Selection of electrodes
placement plays an important role for this purpose. In this study
major four regions of the brain has been covered frontal,
temporal, parietal and occipital region of the scalp and features
are extracted from the signals are standard deviations, kurtosis,
skew and mean. Support Vector Machine is used for the
classification between actual and imaginary motor movement
along with differentiation between baseline and imaginary motor
movement and actual motor movement at 14 different electrodes
positions. Statistical performances of the classifier have been
evaluated by computing sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. The
location involved to achieve maximum accuracy for the
classification of motor movements (actual and imaginary) and no
motor movement is at frontal, temporal and parietal region
whereas very less involvement has been seen of occipital region.

I. INTRODUCTION
Major difference in case of actual and imaginary motor
movement is activation/no activation of muscular signals
inside the brain. Actual motor movement comes along with
the muscular trigger whereas it is completely missing in case
of imaginary motor movement. For the individual with
physical disability of hands can’t make actual movement but
can be operated by giving the signals through the brain. And
for the design of brain computer interface(BCI) application
for the physically disable individual the correlation between
actual and imaginary motor movement should be clearly
studied. So definitely network generated among the brain
region should be apparently different in case of actual and
imaginary motor movement. On the basis of network
generated and supporting relevant features movement and
no movement can be easily understood by the application
through the brain signals which captured by placing
electrode position on the scalp. This is useful to operate the
gadgets with brain signals rather than performing actual
activity so imagine about moving hand is actually equivalent
to moving hand for an BCI application. In literature as per
broadmann atlas brain has various segments responsible for
specified task. In case of physically challenged case, person
can’t operate their hands but still can think about movement.

In this study author have studied the different patterns of
connectivity between the actual ,imaginary motor movement
and no motor movement with eyes open and eyes closed, it
would help to design brain computer interface to help to
survive the physically challenged people. In this study
authors has identified the most activated portion of the brain
in the form of lobes frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital.
Electroencephalography is a non-invasive technique to
record brain signals; various signal processing techniques
can give insight into the mental state, emotional condition of
the person and motion intents. In literature, experiments for
recognition or detection of imaginary motion are available
with different accuracy and relevance. This approach is
beneficial to help the paralysed patients to use the computer
application efficiently. EEG Motor Movement/Imagery
Dataset was used in [1] available on PhysioNet [2]. 106
volunteers were instructed to perform several real or
imaginary movement tasks likes’ fists open and close, feet
movement, etc. while EEG signals were recorded in 64
channel BCI2000 systems. [1] Eighteen intact and four
amputated participants volunteered to perform and/or
imagine to perform eleven motor imagery tasks with a single
hand in [3] like finger and wrist movements, grasping tasks,
etc. Eleven subjects participated for three hand and wrist
movements MI experiment – hand opening/ closing, wrist
flexion/ extension and forearm pronation/ supination in [4]
while EEG data was acquired using G.Nautilus headset with
16 electrodes positioned as per 10/20 system [5]. A dataset
of 64 EEG recordings taken in [7] from 25 healthy subjects
while performing real and imaginary motor movements of
hands and feet. A study comparing Brain computer interface
approaches, P300 and Motor Imagery, was done to identify
the most efficient BCI based typing application. [9] The
EEG signals were recorded using 14 channels Emotiv EEG
headset. Three actions were considered for navigating
through the virtual keyboard- moving across horizontal axis,
vertical axis and selecting the button. The dataset IV a and
IV b of BCI competition III was used for Motor Imagery
classification in [13] and the results of the algorithms were
compared for high dimensional all channel data and just 18
electrode channels in sensory motor cortex area data.
Efficient channel selections algorithms help decide which
channels to consider for a particular EEG application, since
EEG data is recorded from several locations across the
brain. [10] Advantage of channel selection is that it reduces
computational complexity and over fitting, removes noise
while improving the classification accuracy. Filter, wrapper
and hybrid methods for channel selection are discussed in
[10]. In filter method channels are ranked with informationbased measures like correlation coefficient, mutual
information, etc. In wrapper method, a classifier is used to
evaluate the channel subsets.

Hybrid method is a combination of the two, a rather
ensemble approach. For processing the signals are
transformed into time-frequency domain, split into the
standard frequency bands of 2-4 Hz (delta), 4-7 Hz (theta),
8-15 Hz (alpha), 15-29 Hz (beta) and 30-59 Hz (gamma).
Then Hilbert transform is used on the resulting bands to find
the overall activity in a band. [1]. Features like mean,
variance, min, max and sum of squared samples of signal
envelope were extracted for [1] for each sub band in each of
the sensor or electrode position. Signal envelope differences
were calculated and summed up for all the samples, to be
considered as another feature. [1]. A sliding window
approach is used in [3] to decompose each EEG signal into
overlapping segments, convert to time-frequency domain
and extract five categories of time frequency features- logamplitude, amplitude, statistical, spectral, and spectralentropy based category. Common spatial pattern algorithm
was used for feature extraction in [4] from the whole band
and then from the five filtered bands. Discrete Wavelet
Transform (DWT) is used for features extraction from EEG
signals in [6] and input feature vectors like mean, standard
deviation, and peak power gave better classification results.
Features extraction based on spectral density was explored
in [7], after converting the signals into frequency domain
and applying Fast Fourier Transform. A quaternion-based
signal analysis technique is used in [8] to extract features
like average, variance, homogeneity and contrast of EEG
signals. Linear Discriminant Analysis along with Common
Spatial Pattern is used for feature extraction in [11]. The
extracted features are further passed into Sequential
Backward Floating Selection Technique to keep only the
most optimal features. Second Order Blind Identification,
Energy Entropy, and Phase Synchronization measure were
some of the features explored in [12] with Fisher class
separability criterion to decide on the features. Cross
correlation technique was used in [13] for extraction of
features like mean, median, mode, standard deviation,
maximum and minimum.
For data classification Rough Sets theory was used, that
approximates a set by the upper and lower approximation
values present. It is done by first including elements that
may be present in the set, and then elements that are surely
present in the set. [1] A hierarchical classification model of
four layers is used in [3] that classify each of the
overlapping EEG segments into one of the eleven motor
imagery tasks considered. First layer classifies rest or
movement segments, second layer classifies between
functional and basic movements, third layers further
classifies several types of wrist and finger related grasps and
movements and finally the fourth layer classifies the eleven
motor imagery tasks. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used for
classification on whole band features and filtered band
features extracted in [4] and a comparison of accuracy for
each combination of features and classifiers was done.
Clustering algorithms like k-means, k-med, and hierarchical
clustering were used for classification in [7]. While k-means
was observed to classify actual motor tasks well,
hierarchical clustering worked well for imaginary motor
tasks. Boosting techniques on decision trees were used in [8]
for classification with and without a sampling window.
SVM, KNN and Naïve Bayesian Parzen window are the
classifiers used in [11] used for classification of right-hand
motor imagery, left hand motor imagery and rest state.

Multilayer back propagation neural networks is used in [12]
for classification. After cross correlation in [13] LS-SVM
classifier with RBF kernel, Logistic Regression and kernel
Logistic regression were used for MI classification.
Classification results of rough sets method indicated that
universal parameters couldn’t be decided upon, and each
subject had to be considered differently for parameter
selection and classification. [1] For subject dependent
training procedures, accuracy obtained in [3] is 88.8% for
intact participants and 90.2% for amputated participants, and
for subject independent training the accuracy was 80.8% and
87.8% respectively. Detecting actual motor activity of both
hands with 80% accuracy and imaginary motor activity with
just 34% accuracy in [7]. iQSA technique in [8] gives a
82.3% accuracy for 0.5 seconds samples of EEG signal
recordings, and 73.16% for 3 seconds samples. The
proposed model in [11] gives an accuracy of 60.61% for
Emotiv Epoc headset dataset and 86.50% for wet gel
electrodes. The average classification accuracy of sensor
signals in [12] is 72.6%, that of SOBI is 90.6%, energy
entropy is 84.4%, and phase synchronization measure is
86.2%. The average accuracy rate for motor area channels in
[13] for CC-LS-SVM is 97.12%, CC-LR is 88.18%, CCKLR is 95.35%. For all channels, CC-LS-SVM gives
97.96% accuracy, CC-LR gives 93.59% and CC-KLR gives
96.68%.In this study authors have proposed the approach to
identify the connectivity among the various electrodes
position placed on the scalp. Rest of the paper is organized

various functions like execution functions, motor functions,
somatosensosory function, attention, visual functions,
memory, emotional regulation ,sound. In this study authors
have to investigate the activated regions associated with
eyes open, eyes close, actual motor movement and
imaginary motor movement. As per the broadman regions of
brain responsible for targeted activity is majorly frontal and
occipital. Primary motor movement can be captured by
electrode positioning on frontal and parietal lobe, Secondary
motor movement can be captured by frontal lobe there is no
involvement of parietal lobe in this context. Imaginary
motor movement can be captured by placing the electrode
on frontal lobe. Eyes blink can be captured easily from
frontal lobe. With this knowledge author have selected the
electrode position as per 10-20 standards which have a good
coverage of frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital region.
Electrodes selected are
Frontal: AF3, AF4, F7, F8, F3, F4, FC5, FC6;Temporal: T7
and T8;Parietal: P7, P8 and Occipital: O1 and O2.Original
recording has filtered by using the Butterworth high pass
filter to remove the frequency above 60 Hz and connectivity
among the various electrode position has been identified
.Features has been extracted from the filtered data.
Recording of baseline eyes open and eyes close each have
samples captured 9760 in 1 min run which results into
sampling frequency of 9760/60=162.66 samples/sec. It is
segmented into window size of 3 sec each results into 500
data samples and total 19 segments .Features have been
extracted from 19 individual segments which result into
feature file of 19*4 for each subject and individual channel
thus total dimension of feature file for eyes open results into
(19*10*4)*(individual channel).Recording of actual motor
movement and imaginary motor movement each have
samples captured in 2 min run which results into sampling
frequency of 19680/120=164 samples/sec.It is segmented
into window size of 750 samples of 4.4 sec and total 26
segments. Features have been extracted from 26 individual
segments which result into feature file of 26*4 for each
subject and individual channel thus total dimension of
feature file for actual and imaginary motor movement
results into (26*10*4)*(individual channel).
C. Design of Classifier:
The entire approach used in this study from the selection of
appropriate electrode position ,identification of functional
connectivity, feature extraction ,statistical significance of
the extracted features and building of classifier is as shown
in figure 2.

DISCUSSION

The results fetched in this study are significant as per the
prominent regions of the scalp. Authors have fetched the
results as per the electrode position on the scalp. The
functional connectivity results as shown in figure 3 and
table1 to 4. For the baseline eyes open and eyes close
activity frontal regions has shown the prominent activity on
the scalp and very less intervention has been observed at
occipital region as alpha activity is more prominent in this

region. In case of imaginary motor movement of left and
right fist strongest activation has been observed at almost all
the regions of the brain whereas in actual motor movement
of left and right fist no involment has been observed of
occipital region. As shown in table 6 , classification between
the actual and imaginary motor movement is very less and
which is even expected that
there should be very less

difference in the brain activity of actual and imaginary
motor movement that’s why accuracy lies in the range of
50% at all the electrode position, which clearly indicates
that to provide EEG signal to the brain computer interface
by imaginary motor movement stands similar as actual
motor movement. In case of baseline eyes closed and
imaginary motor movement significant difference has been
observed at AF3,F7,T7,P7,FC6,F4,F8 and AF4 whereas no
results has been retrieved for the electrode position F3,so
frontal region is more prominent for the classification
accuracy of no motor movement and imaginary motor
movement. In case of baseline eyes open and actual motor
movement significant difference has been observed for the
electrode position AF3, F7, FC5, T7, FC6, F4, F8 and AF4
and no results has been fetched for electrode position
F3.Results I table 6 clearly indicates that for the
differentiation between no movement and motor movement
(actual /imaginary) frontal region is more prominent and
signals generated by eeg can be used to operate an interface
for the physical disable person.
