Findings of recent studies have proposed that it is possible to enhance cognitive capacities of healthy
individuals by means of individual upper alpha (around 10 to 13.5 Hz) neurofeedback training.
Although these results are promising, most of this research was conducted based on high-priced EEG
systems developed for clinical and research purposes only. This study addresses the question whether
such effects can also be shown with an easy to use and comparably low priced Emotiv Epoc EEG
headset available for the average consumer. In addition, critical voices were raised regarding the control
group designs of studies addressing the link between neurofeedback training and cognitive performance.
Based on an extensive literature review revealing considerable methodological issues in an important
part of the existing research, the present study addressed the question whether individual upper alpha
neurofeedback has a positive effect on alpha amplitudes (i.e. increases alpha amplitudes) and short-term
memory performance focussing on a methodologically sound, single-blinded, sham controlled design.

Participants (N = 33) took part in four test sessions over four consecutive days of either neurofeedback
training or sham feedback (control group). In the experimental group, five three-minute periods of visual
neurofeedback training were administered each day whereas in the control group, the same amount of
sham feedback was presented. Performance on eight digit-span tests as well as participants’ affective
states were assessed before and after each of the daily training sessions.

Participants in the neurofeedback training (NFT) group showed faster and greater alpha enhancement
compared to the control group. Contrary to the authors’ expectations, alpha enhancement was also
observed in the control group. Surprisingly, exploratory analyses showed a significant correlation
between the initial alpha level and the alpha improvement during the course of the study. This finding
suggests that participants with high initial alpha levels profit more from alpha NFT interventions. digitspan performance increased in both groups over the course of time. However, the increase in individual
upper relative alpha did not explain significant variance of digit-span improvement. In the discussion,
the authors explore the appearance of the alpha enhancement in the control group and possible reasons
for the absence of a connection between NFT and short-term memory.

To sum up, NFT can be described as a process during which neural activity is consecutively shaped into

college students using drugs like Methylphenidate (MPH, Ritalin) or Modafinil to enhance
concentration, memory performance and wakefulness (16% on some college campuses, see e.g. [1–3]).
Rather than demonising the need for cognitive enhancement, the aim of this piece of research is to
examine the usefulness of the non-invasive technique of neurofeedback training (NFT) for cognitive
enhancement. Previous research addressing this question has reported some evidence for a positive
relationship. However, to the authors’ knowledge, no study has tested the effectiveness of NFT with a
not-medical grade EEG. This gap in current research, leaves the average consumer torn between the
glorious slogans of a booming BCI industry with their easy-to-use and low-priced devices and a
common sense which tries to disentangle advertising from possibility and innovation. On top of that,
the task is complicated by science, which works beyond the omnipresent publication bias [e.g. 4] with
methodologically problematic designs like no-intervention control groups.

effectiveness of alpha NFT with an easy to use and low priced EEG Headset and a corresponding
software. Secondly, it provides an overview regarding methodological aspects in the field of alpha NFT
and cognitive enhancement. Or, to put it differently, the authors humbly try to support average
consumers when they are faced with questions like “If I train with an Emotiv Epoc and the corresponding
software, will my short-term memory get better?”.

during which subjects learn to influence their EEG pattern, for example by enhancing their individual
upper alpha (IUA) amplitude [5]. However, other EEG components like the amplitude of different EEG
frequency bands e.g. theta, alpha or beta can be fed back as well. The feedback can be provided as bar
graph [6], colour code [7] or as a function of different sounds [8]. In combination with a mental strategy
(e.g. thinking about friends, [9]), the users can shape their brain activity into a certain direction (for
instance enhance alpha activity), which in the case of alpha is considered to be beneficial for cognitive
performance [10]. NFT can be seen as non-invasive technique to alter brain activity. Unlike for example
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), NFT does not interfere actively with the brain but serves
merely as a mirror of the current amplitude of the target frequency band.

a predefined direction, by applying a mental strategy (e.g. visualizing engaging in a hobby) which is
adjusted during a circular learning process (see Figure 3), based on a EEG feedback (e.g. colour scheme,
sounds), in combination with conditioning procedures (reward processes, symbols or sounds). This
process of altering oscillatory cerebral activity to increase the individual upper alpha amplitudes can,
according to some authors [5,11,12], positively influence cognitive performance.

In the field of therapeutic application of NFT, one of the best established application domains is the

study at hand follows three different purposes. Firstly, we aimed at replicating findings of previous
experiments which indicated beneficial effects of individual upper alpha NFT on cognitive performance
[5,13], while secondly taking a step into the direction of the average consumer by choosing an affordable
device which is easy to use. Thirdly, an overview of methodological aspects like control group designs
and blindfolding of publications in the field of alpha NFT and cognitive performance shall be given.
Before these three areas of interest are explored more in detail, a short introduction into the origin of

practice over the past 50 years (e.g. [14–17]). Various studies indicated that NFT shows positive effects
in the treatment of diseases like Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder,
Substance Use Disorder and Epilepsy (e.g. [14–24]). Also with regard to other disorders (e.g. General
Anxiety Disorder, see [29]), there are some studies suggesting positive effects of NFT. Recently, a first
pilot study investigating the usefulness of NFT as intervention technique for patients suffering from
Alzheimer Disease (AD) revealed that “neurofeedback, in combination with treatment with
cholinesterase inhibitors, may be a potential treatment by which the progressive deterioration in patients
with AD can be stabilized” [30]. Finally, NFT seems to facilitate effectively the lives of people affected
by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or the so-called Locked-in Syndrome [31].

treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder. Different studies have shown positive results of a
NFT intervention. For example Linden et al. [32] conducted a study with an intensive training schedule
of forty 45-min sessions of NFT over a period of 6 months. The training aimed at enhancing beta activity
and supressing theta activity at the electrode sites Cz and Pz (international 10-20 system). NFT was
given by means of computer games and conditioning was enhanced by rewarding the participants with
small gifts after the intervention, if the level of performance was satisfying. After the training course,
the experimental group performed significantly better compared to the waiting list control group and
compared to the individual pre-course measurement on both, an IQ-Test (K-Bit IQ) and a parent
behaviour rating scale for inattention.

to support this hypothesis [33] and according to Klimesch [12], especially the individual upper alpha
band is of major importance for cognitive performance.

alpha (about 8 – 13 Hz) and beta (about 13 – 30 Hz) can be extracted. The IUA constitutes a sub-band

amplitude instead of power values has the advantage that it prevents excessive skewing and improves
the validity of the statistical analysis [6]. Sometimes (e.g. [34]), instead of amplitude values, relative
alpha values are calculated by dividing the mean amplitude of the individual upper alpha band by the
mean amplitude of the whole EEG. This normalization avoids variance in the absolute alpha amplitude
caused by changes between trials due to changes in impedance between the electrodes and the scalp. By
normalizing, the frequency band of interest is relativized, which mitigates the issue of attenuations
caused by external factors, which affect all frequency bands equally [6].

in the human brain in a resting state, especially when eyes are closed [35]. Until the 80’s, Alpha NFT
was considered as a simple relaxation training, located within the theoretical framework of unitary
arousal models. Only during the 90’s, new interest arose and from then on many different research
questions circulated around the alpha frequency band [36], which will be outlined in the following
paragraphs.

and cognitive performance and neurological disorders, respectively. After conducting a FFT, the data
can be plotted in a frequency spectrum map. In resting state recordings, the alpha peak is clearly visible
between 7.5 and 12.5 Hz and constitutes one of the strongest components of the FFT. Higher alpha peak
frequencies (e.g. 12 Hz in comparison to 10 Hz) correlate negatively with neurological disorders and
with low age and high age. Furthermore, higher alpha peak frequencies correlate positively with high
memory performance [37,38] and IQ [39].

performance. For example Neubauer and colleagues [40] found a positive correlation between
individual upper alpha amplitude and IQ. More specifically, high alpha power during a resting state and
low alpha power during the execution of a task was associated with good performance in semantic longterm memory tasks [12]. According to Klimesch [12], alpha shows a task-related desynchronization, it
increases during resting states (especially when eyes are closed) and decreases during performance of a
cognitive task (e.g. mental calculations). Therefore, it seems to be a promising approach to mimic the
phenomena observed in good performers by means of NFT (enhanced alpha power during a resting
period shortly before the short-term memory task) in order to enhance cognitive performance.

performance only when the alpha band was divided into two sub-bands: upper and lower alpha.
Klimesch located the upper alpha band between the individual alpha peak (IAP, between 7.5 and 12.5
Hz) and IAP + 2 Hz and stated that the lower alpha band is connected to a “variety of non-task and nonstimulus specific factors which may be subsumed under the term ‘attention’ […] and reflect general
task demands” [12]. This author located the lower alpha band between IAP - 4 and IAP. Therefore, in
most of the studies, the individual upper alpha (IUA) band was used for NFT and some researchers go
as far as assessing the alpha band each test session anew.

Based on these findings, several studies examined the connection between IUA activity and cognitive

transcranial magnetic stimulation in a within-subject design [33]. In line with the correlational findings
between alpha desynchronization and cognitive performance, the participants were stimulated to
produce more IUA activity (individual alpha peak + 1 Hz) at P6 and Fz before the execution of a task.
In this way, the natural desynchronization process which can be found in participants showing high
cognitive performance (i.e. mental rotation and short-term memory performance) was mimicked. In the
control condition, participants also ‘underwent’ transcranial magnetic stimulation, but the coil was
rotated by 90° so the participants did not receive any stimulation. The results show a significant increase
of IUA during transcranial magnetic stimulation in the experimental condition, as well as decreased test
power, resulting in a large event-related desynchronization. None of these changes were observed in the
control condition. Cognitive performance was assessed in terms of success in a Mental Rotation Task.
Results showed that mental rotation performance in the experimental condition was higher compared to
the control condition. The authors interpreted these findings as an indicator for a causal relationship
between IUA activity and cognitive performance in healthy subjects.

performance. In those studies, different aspects of cognitive performance like short-term memory
performance or working memory performance were assessed via a digit-span Task or a Conceptual
Span Task (e.g. [5,41]), or Mental Rotation Task [42]. Mental flexibility and executive functions were
assessed via the Trail Making Test [43], or creativity by the Unusual Uses Test [44]. Summarizing the
results of these studies, imply a positive connection between individual upper alpha NFT and different
aspects of cognitive performance like working memory/STM and visuospatial rotation. Whether the
relationship between IUA and STM is of causal or correlational character, which underlying
mechanisms lead to the enhancing effect of individual upper alpha NFT on cognitive performance and
whether unspecific environmental factors of the experimental setup play a key role in the process of
NFT is still not fully understood at the moment. In the following section, some of these aspects are
addressed by a comprehensive analysis of published studies addressing the link between IUA and
cognitive performance.

1.3. Summary of Experimental Studies on Neurofeedback Training and
Cognitive Performance
This section summarizes findings of studies addressing the link between IUA and cognitive
performance. Inspired by Rogala and colleagues [45], Table 1 gives an overview of the existing
experimental research addressing NFT training (Alpha and Alpha/Theta) and its effects on behavioural
measurements of attention (column “A”) and memory (column “M”). Column “G” represents general
success and subsumes general effects of the training obtained in any of the investigated measures other
than memory and attention. Studies regarding Alpha NFT and Memory were highlighted grey and
methodological aspects which deserve critical attention are marked bold. The overview contains studies
that appear in [45] (marked with an asterisk *) as well as new research that has not been considered in
their review. Inclusion criteria were that the studies used alpha as feedback frequency and the dependent
variable was not a clinical outcome. The studies vary with regard to the feedback direction
(upwards/increment or downwards/decrement, marked as + or -) and its effect on different behavioural

In the past years, considerable progress was made in the development of new EEG hard- and software:

design with regard to a control intervention and blindfolding, which found a significant effect of alphaup-training on memory [13]. Because of this apparent lack of evidence, this piece of research constitutes
a replication study for the positive effect of alpha NFT on short-term memory performance while
emphasizing the methodological aspects of the control group design and approaching the average
consumer by using an easy in use and low-priced Emotiv Epoc EEG headset. That is why replications
are needed to strengthen and better understand these initial findings.

today, EEG systems are available which do not require conductive gel but use saline electrodes or
operate with dry electrodes instead (e.g. Quasar, Neurosky or Emotiv). Along with this simplification
of physiological measurements, EEG systems are becoming increasingly user-friendly and affordable.
These new user-friendly and low-priced systems do not claim to compete with state of the art high-

No such effect is observed in the sham feedback (SF) control group.

participation, they earned 5 credit points on a university-intern reward system. Participants were
assigned randomly to either the experimental neurofeedback training group (NFT group, n1 = 17, MAge
= 21.29, 12 female) or the control sham feedback group (SF group, n2 = 16, MAge = 21.13, 14 female).
To assess whether subjects were aware of their condition, the last experimental task was to guess which
group they were assigned to. The statement ‘I was assigned to the control group’ was answered on a 7point Likert scale (ranging from ‘I strongly disagree’ to ‘I strongly agree’). Analysis of the data showed
that NFT and SF group did not differ, which indicates that participants in either group were unaware of
their status (MNFT = 2.60, SDP1 = 1.45; MSF = 3.18, SDSF = 0.33; t(29) = 1.18, p = .249).

In order to control for the influence of the circadian rhythm [12], each participant was scheduled to
come to the laboratory at the same time-slot on 4 consecutive days (i.e. 4 sessions, e.g. from Monday
to Friday always at 10 o’clock), see Fig 1.

and a series of questionnaires concerning their daily physical activities and use of substances like
caffeine, alcohol and cannabis, variables that have possible implications on alpha activity [80–82].
Participants then performed a short-term memory test followed by two 2-min resting state EEG
recording epochs, one with eyes closed and another with eyes open. These baseline recordings were
used to assess the individual upper alpha peak for the NFT group (see next section for details).

min periods with a 30 second break in-between. For S1, participants first received verbal and written
information about alpha activity and were encouraged to be creative and come up with five personal
strategies for the five periods of NFT (or SF). A list with five strategies (positive thinking, evoking
emotions, visualizing activities, love and physiological calm) based on [5] was offered to participants
who had difficulty coming up with their own ideas. Participants were asked to use only one strategy
during each period, write it down during the break and to use every strategy only once over the course
of the five periods. This procedure allowed to determine the most-successful alpha-enhancing strategy
(one strategy, which produced the highest relative IUA for each participant). The participants were
instructed to use their most successful strategy during the following sessions of S2 to S4.

(see e.g. [83,84]). Using a simple channel spectra procedure in EEGLAB (pop_fourieeg), each
session’s baseline recordings was analysed to determine the IUA frequency band, which was then
used in that session. More specifically, the individual alpha peak (IAP) between 7.5 and 12.5 Hz [12]
was assessed from the eyes closed resting condition and the lower and upper border of the IUA
frequency band were defined as IAP and IAP + 2, respectively. We used the Emotiv 3D Brain Activity
Map standalone software to provide IUA feedback with a colour spectrum ranging from grey (low
IUA amplitude) over green to red (high IUA amplitude). During each session’s period, participants
watched their real-time IUA activity at occipital and parietal sites (P7, O1, O2, and P8) colour-coded
on the surface of an animated head (see Fig 3) and were advised to produce as much red activity as
possible. Participants in the experimental group performed IUA NFT always with a real-time IUA
band feedback. The control group received SF by watching recordings of NFT sessions from another
subject not included in this sample.

saline sensors. The device is wireless and transmits data via Bluetooth through the 2.4 GHz band, has a
battery autonomy of 12 hours and uses a built-in amplifier, as well as a CMS-DRL circuit for the
reduction of external electrical noise. It has a sampling rate of 128 bit/s, a bandwidth ranging from 0 to
64 Hz, automatic digital notch filters at 50 Hz and 60 Hz and the dynamic range referred to the input is
8400µV(pp). Moreover, a digital 5th order Sinc filter is built-in and impedance can be measured in realtime. EEG was recorded using the software Emotiv TestBench, ground-reference was M1 and sampling
method was by default sequential sampling.
All analyses were carried out with MATLAB and EEGLAB [85]. The data was pre-processed using the
following methods: re-referencing to channel M1, automatic removal of bad epochs using the command
pop_autorej, calculation of IC weights with the runica algorithm. Following [34], the relative alpha
values for both, NFT and SF were calculated from the pre-processed EEG by dividing the mean
amplitude of the IUA band (defined individually in the same way as in the NFT, between the IAP and
IAP + 2 Hz) by the mean amplitude of the entire EEG bandwidth (Equation 1).

This normalization was applied to avoid variability in the absolute amplitude between trials and sessions
due to changes in impedance between electrodes and scalp. This way, attenuations caused by external
factors that affect all frequency bands are mitigated. Furthermore, we worked with amplitude instead of
power values to prevent excessive skewing and improve the validity of the statistical analysis [6].

All analyses were carried out with the IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 24)

questionnaire. Short-term memory performance was assessed by means of a forward digit span test
taken from the PEBL test battery [86]. During this test, digits appeared on the screen and participants
were advised to memorize them. On first trial, three digits appeared one after another and the participant
typed them into an input field in the same order as they had appeared. In case of a correct answer, a
positive feedback was given and the trial was repeated with the same number of digits. If the participant
succeeded again, the number of digit was increased by one. The test continued until the participant typed
in a wrong answer on two consecutive trials. Two performance indicators were assessed. One is the
digit span itself, defined as the highest amount of digits the participants remembered correctly. Another
measure is the total correct value, representing the total number of correct answers. For example, a digit
span of 9 indicates that the participant was able to remember 9 digits correctly. The total correct value
in this example however can vary between 7 and 16 because participants were allowed to continue with
the test if they made an error in one trial (e.g. they remembered 8 digits only once). In the statistical
analysis of the present study, only total correct values are reported.

and R [87]. If not indicated differently, the chosen level of significance for all analyses was α = .05
(5%). Data were analysed with several mixed-measures design ANOVAs and corresponding contrast
analyses using either a polynomial or a simple algorithm. Concerning the mixed design ANOVAs,
Mauchly’s Test of Sphericity was taken into account. If Mauchly’s Test was not significant (p ≥ .20),
sphericity was assumed. When Mauchly’s Test was significant (p < .20) and Greenhouse-Geisser
Epsilon was smaller than .75, Greenhouse-Geisser corrected results were reported. When Mauchly’s
Test was significant (p < .20) and Greenhouse-Geisser Epsilon was larger than .75, Huynh-Feldt
corrected results were reported.

Additionally, for a more detailed picture, paired-samples t-tests with Bonferroni adjustment were

correction was applied by multiplying the p-value of all associated t-tests by the number performed ttests.

Hence, all alpha measurements were standardized by subtracting the mean value of the first
measurement. By applying this standardisation to experimental group and control group separately, it
was assured both groups had the same initial value of alpha and digit-span, respectively. Digit-span
values were not standardized because they did not differ during the first measurement (MNFT = 8.76,

extraction. The number of principal components (PCs) was chosen by interpreting the scree plot, and
choosing the number of components until when diminishing returns would be obtained, guaranteed that
at least 60% of variance could be explained. Each PC was then used as the response variable of a linear
mixed effects model, resulting in one linear model for each PC. Each model had two random variables:
subject as the random intercept and session number as the random slope. The fixed effect term was a
triple interaction between period, experimental group and changes in relative alpha. Changes in relative
alpha at each period were computed using an area under the curve with respect to increase (AUCi)
formula described in [88], and these values were averaged for each session. Satterthwaite approximation
for the degrees of freedom was used to compute p-values with the lmerTest package in the R
programming environment [89].

inclusion of pre-session relaxation increases the predictive validity of the experimental group in changes
for relative alpha for each session. A mixed effects model was used to predict the session average
relative alpha AUCi, using each subject as the random intercept and session number as the random
slope. The fixed effect term was the moderation between experimental group and pre-session relaxation.
The moderation was introduced to understand if pre-session relaxation increases in alpha would be
specific to one of the experimental groups. If the interaction term was not significant, we would test the
additive model. For the latter, pre-session alpha would be tested as a suppressor variable. Satterthwaite
approximation for the degrees of freedom was used to compute p-values with the lmerTest package in
the R programming environment.

average amplitude of the individual upper alpha band (around 10 to 13.5 Hz) by the average amplitude of the entire
EEG band (i.e. 0.5 to 64 Hz). Moreover, relative alpha values was standardized with the first measurement (i.e.

the unstandardized initial relative alpha (P1) and the alpha improvement during the course of the
experiment (P20 minus P1) was observed, r(31) = .44, p = .011. This finding was supported when the
same analysis was performed on the level of test days (sessions). The initial relative alpha during the
first Period (S1) correlated with the mean improvement over the course of the experiment (S4), r(31) =
.52, p = .002. In other words, participants who exhibited a high relative alpha in the beginning of the
experiment had a higher gain in alpha during the training compared to participants who started with a
low alpha level.
The findings examined so far are partially in concordance with hypothesis H1, stating a positive effect
of NFT on relative IUA. The IUA increase in the experimental group is observed earlier and the
difference between P1 and P20 shows significance only in the NFT group. Interestingly and contrary to
our expectation, alpha enhancement could be observed in the control group as well, when contrast
analyses are taken into consideration.

In order to infer how NFT affected mood changes during the experiment, we calculated the differences
in mood from the beginning to the end of each session. We also calculated total amount of change in
relative alpha at each period using an area under the curve with respect to increase (AUCi) formula
described in [88]. The 12 mood change variables, and one variable representing effort, were compressed
using principle component analysis (PCA) into 5 principal components (PCs) explaining 60.2% of the
variability in the original variables (See Fig 7A). Varimax rotation was used to facilitate interpretation
of each PC, resulting in the loading matrix in Fig 7B. Each PC was used as the response variable in a
linear mixed effects model (see Figure 7C for the model with PC5 as the response variable) with each
subject as the random intercept, session number as the random slope and a triple interaction between
period, experimental group and relative alpha AUCi. The only PC with a significant (p = 0.030, however
when applying Bonferroni correction for 5 comparisons pcorrected = 0.152) triple interaction predictor was

PC5, a component that loads positively on the variable changes in the bad mood (positive values of PC5
represent an increase in bad mood). This model had a total explanatory power (conditional R2) of
48.06%. The triple interaction between session, relative alpha AUCi and experimental group (see Figure
7C; β = 0.30, SE = 0.14, 95% CI [0.035, 0.57], t(105) = 2.20, p = .030, pcorrected = 0.152) could be
considered a small effect (std. β = 0.33, std. SE = 0.15). Simple main effects for each experimental
group were analyzed in order to evaluate whether the interaction of session and relative alpha AUCi
was significant only for the NFT group (after correcting for these two comparisons). For this group, the
interaction effect between Session and relative alpha AUCi was significant (β = -0.30, SE = 0.12, 95%
CI [-0.53, -0.070], t(52) = -2.56, p = .014, pcorrected = 0.028) and could be considered as small (std. β = 0.25, std. SE = 0.097). Since no effects were found for the control group (p = 0.997, pcorrected = 1), these
results suggest that in the NFT group, learning to progressively increase the relative alpha band lead to
small but significant reductions in bad mood.

participants in the control group, although not receiving real feedback, were also trying relaxation
strategies (since this was one of the cognitive strategies recommended to participants). Therefore, we
decided to investigate if the experimental group variable would be capable to predict higher relative
alpha AUCi values in the NFT group by accounting for the moderation between experimental group
and pre-session relaxation. Fitting the model described in Figure 8 to the data, the effect of experimental
Group was significant (β = -1.89, SE = 0.72, 95% CI [-3.30, -0.47], t(94) = -2.63, p < .010) and could
be considered small (std. β = -0.20, std. SE = 0.17). The negative value of the estimated coefficient
points to a lower overall relative alpha AUCi for the control Group. The effect of the interaction between
level of relaxation at the beginning of the session and experimental Group (β = 0.47, SE = 0.19, 95%
CI [0.088, 0.84], t(99) = 2.45, p = .016) and could be considered small (std. β = 0.44, std. SE = 0.18).
This indicates either the NFT or the control group could show an effect of level of relaxation on the
production of relative alpha. A post hoc analysis revealed that this is not true for the NFT group: The
effect of being relaxed was not significant (β = -0.19, SE = 0.11, t(37) = -1.63, p = .112). For the control
group there was a trend for being relaxed leading to more relative alpha increases (β = 0.28, SE = 0.15,
95% CI [-0.029, 0.58], t(53) = 1.87, p = 0.068) and the effect could be considered small (std. β = 0.23,
std. SE = 0.12). These results suggest that if the level of relaxation before each Session is taken into
consideration, then it is possible to observe an overall effect of NFT on the production of relative alpha.
It also suggests that for the control group, being relaxed might have been what lead to increases in
relative alpha.

Furthermore, we hypothesised the control group would not show an enhancement in alpha activity.

due to the comparing models for five PCs, the triple interaction term in panel C is no longer significant (pcorrected =
0.152). For panels D and E, when applied, Bonferroni correction controls for two comparisons made in the simple
main effects analysis resulting in a significant interaction effect ‘Session x relative alpha’ AUCi (pcorrected = 0.028).

design. In line with previous results [5], an enhancing effect of the training on the relative alpha and on
short-term memory performance (digit-span Task) was expected.

period 1 and period 20 which could not be observed in the sham feedback group. Moreover, contrasts
showed that the increase in alpha was obtained much earlier (period 3) for participants who saw their
real-time brain activity compared to participants who followed a sham-feedback intervention (period
11). Additionally, we also observed that if the level of relaxation before each Session is taken into
account, it is possible to observe a clear effect of NFT on the production of relative alpha. All in all, the
results regarding relative alpha indicate that up-training alpha with a real-time NFT procedure facilitates
the process of enhancing alpha activity. Thus, the results of the present study were in accordance with
hypothesis H1.

Interestingly though, contrast analyses showed the opposite was true and mixed measure longitudinal
analysis indicated that the slope for both groups were equal. One possible explanation for this finding
is that the control group was given feedback during the first session. Although sham feedback was used
for this group, by the end of this session they were informed of the most successful mental strategies
for alpha upregulation. This would imply that it is possible to infer appropriate mental strategies within
one session and that coherent visual feedback might not be necessary for ensuing sessions to upregulate
alpha to a certain degree, provided the adequate mental strategy is used. This interpretations seems to
be in line with studies showing an alpha enhancing effect of certain types of meditation (e.g. [48–50]).
A replication study with an additional control group that would not be informed about which strategies
are generally linked to alpha enhancement might address this question. Another possible explanation
resides in the framework of socio-physiological processes. Alpha is enhanced by being in a calm and
resting state and in the course of the current study, participants became more and more familiar with the
experimental environment, as well as with the experimenter. It is likely that the participants became
more and more relaxed, comfortable and calm during the later sessions of NFT/SF, which might have
led to the observed enhanced level of alpha in the control group. This interpretation finds some support
in the analysis of extraneous variables, which suggests that being relaxed is an important factor for

evidence supported hypothesis H2. There was indeed a significant effect of time throughout the eight

effect of NFT on STM performance. All in all, these findings contradicted our hypotheses and several
explanations can be put forward.

to practice and it seemed to be stronger than the more subtle positive impact of higher alpha amplitude.
Electrode placement could also be responsible for the lack of effect of NFT on STM performance.
Feedback signals were acquired from P7, O1, O2 and P8 because the occipital cortex is involved in
every visual process and parietal sites are connected to attention (e.g. [45]). It is possible though, that
the choice of electrodes influenced or impaired the effect of the NFT on STM performance. Many
authors use electrode sites like Cz, Pz, Fz and C3 which differ from the sites used during the current
study (see e.g. [9,13,51,52]). However parietal and occipital electrode sites are used commonly for IUA
NFT as well (e.g. [10,36,53]). Finally, the possibility of the absence of an effect of IUA NFT on STM
performance should be considered. Previous studies where this effect was reported have used nointervention or waiting-list control groups (e.g. [5,10]), which deserve critical attention. Neither have
they ruled out the expectancy effect on the side of the participants (placebo or Hawthorne effect, [94]),
nor did such designs compensate for a potential experimenter bias. In the few studies using randomized
sham feedback control groups, no significant results indicating an effect of alpha feedback on STM
performance could be reported [60,95]. All these observations are in accordance with the review of
Rogala [45], which excluded many alpha NFT studies for methodological considerations and could rate
only one study [70] as success in regard of the effect of NFT on memory (i.e. digit-span task).

effect. Although it is used in various clinical test batteries and generally is considered a useful indicator
for cognitive performance [96], the digit-span task used in this study showed rather low intra-individual
variation and strong learning effects in the repeated measures design. Therefore, a different measure for
cognitive performance (e.g. Mental Rotation Task, N-Back or a Trail Making Test) might have led to
larger variances without concealing a potential NFT effect by learning.

code as feedback signal. Other authors worked with very specific reward symbols and sounds (e.g.
beeps, counters, pleasant sounds or even applause, [25,48,50]). Future implementations should
guarantee that NFT is done in an immersive environment with clear and intuitive rewards. This is
particularly important in the perspective of NFT with commercially available devices since they most
probably will be used outside controlled laboratory settings.

enhance individual upper alpha activity. Participants were asked to maintain the same strategy after the
first training session. Interestingly, the corresponding gain in alpha activity on the first day was very
high compared not only to the first measurement of NFT but also compared to the rest of the training

course. In period 5 (P5), participants in the NFT group reached nearly the same relative alpha (MIUA,P5
= 0.30, SDIUA,P5 = 0.49) as in the last period, P20 (MIUA,P20 = 0.36, SDIUA,P20 = 0.66). Perhaps, choosing
one successful strategy for alpha enhancement is not as effective as advising the participants “to be
guided by the feedback process” itself [56] or to interchange between more than one strategies in order
to avoid fatigue or, the effect of alpha NFT plateaus in general after a certain amount of training like
Dekker states [54].
One of the main motivations for this study was to assess if a commercially available EEG device could
offer the necessary means to achieve EEG self-regulation and, in turn, reap its benefits in cognitive
improvement. We think this is an important question to answer given the promising benefits of NFT on
mental health and well-being, its non-invasiveness, and the growing affordability of commercial EEG
devices; NFT is no longer just important in the clinical setting, but also in real-life settings. Although
our hypotheses for cognitive improvement were not verified, we observed promising results in our
experimental group concerning alpha upregulation: this group achieved significant alpha increases
faster and these increases were associated with decreases in negative mood. We expect this study to be
a stepping stone in larger collection of works that aim for ecological validity and sound experimental
design. Ultimately, it will be possible to collect data from a large number of participants following NFT
at their homes, workplaces or any place of their choosing so, it is urgent to start defining appropriate
protocols. While the NFT implementation of the present study might not be suitable for the daily use,
NFT harbours great potential, especially, in our opinion, when combined with gamification strategies.
This way, the enhancing effect of NFT could be combined with the immanent beneficial effect of
computer games (see e.g. [57]) and immersive virtual environments. Future research should not only
focus on theoretical aspects of the working mechanism behind NFT, but on the development of engaging
NFT implementations with practical relevance.
