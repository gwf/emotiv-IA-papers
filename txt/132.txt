Abstract—The purpose of this paper is to investigate the applicability of duty cycle for steady-state visual evoked potential
(SSVEP)-based application. For this, the time-frequency analysis
of SSVEP during visual stimuli presentation with different duty
cycles was performed. The commercial wireless EEG headset
with O1 and O2 channels was utilized to record the associated
brain activity. The experimental paradigm, in this experiment,
we mainly focus on instantaneously changes of duty cycle of
SSVEP in the four principal frequency bands, i.e., theta (3 - 7
Hz), alpha (8 - 12 Hz), beta (13 - 30 Hz), and gamma (30 - 40 Hz).
Peak magnitude, peak frequency, and spectral coherence of
SSVEP were measured. Results showed that coherences measured in the theta and alpha bands differed significantly with p <
0.001. Thus, the present results suggest that the duty cycle is
recommended as a feature for potential multicommand SSVEPbased applications.

I. INTRODUCTION
Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) are
neural responses to visual stimulation at specific frequencies
when the retina is stimulated by a visual stimulus ranging
from approximately 3.5 Hz to 75 Hz [1]. In neuroscience,
SSVEP has been widely used to identify evoked responses by
visual stimulations, e.g., superposition, averaging, frequency
analysis, and correlation analysis [2]. SSVEPs are practical
and useful in research because of its excellent signal-to-noise
ratio and relative immunity to artifacts [3]. The application of
using SSVEP-based system has succeeded widely in many
disciplines. Especially, the SSVEP-based brain computer
interface (BCI) system detects electroencephalogram (EEG)
over an occipital lobe position (the anatomical region of the
visual cortex; O1 or O2) when a visual stimulus flickering at a
constant frequency. The driving pulses used in most of the
past studies had a 50% on/off duty cycle (or D =0.5) [4][5].
Mostly, SSVEP-based BCIs use flickering frequencies lower
than 20 Hz for visual flickering to retain a high signal level
[6]. Although it is commonly recognized that the SSVEP
response depends on the frequency of the stimulation, i.e.,
flickering, there are relatively few studies the duty cycle of
the visual stimuli, which is usually not mentioned in investigating this relation in detail.

Recently, an SSVEP-based BCI using different dutycycle visual flicker has been proposed. Lee et al. [7] and Shyu
et al [8], they presented the different duty cycles for their
SSVEP-based BCI system. The SSVEP responses depend on
three main parameters: 1) The frequency in three bands: 512Hz, 12-25Hz and 30-50Hz, 2) the intensity of the flickering
light, and 3) the structure of the repetitive visual pattern. The
human SSVEP has larger amplitudes from alpha to low beta
ranges and reaches its maximum amplitude at approximately
8-13 Hz [9][10]. Herrmann [14] reported that the SSVEP
responses exhibited resonance phenomena around 10, 20, 40
and 80 Hz. With the duty cycle, multi-command SSVEPbased system can be realized by using only one flicker frequency. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to examine
the consequence of the visual stimulation that produced
SSVEP responses associated with duty cycle changing continuously in terms of time-frequency characteristics.
II. MATERIAL AND METHOD
EEG data were acquired by using a wireless EmotivTM
headset at the sampling rate of 128 Hz and 14-bit resolution,
with a band-pass filter of 0.2-45Hz, digital notch filters at
50Hz. Four healthy subjects participated in this study. The
average age of the subjects was 25.75(5.44). These subjects
had no report of epileptic seizure. For each trial, all the subjects were instructed to view a stimuli displaying on a center
of laptop LCD screen with a resolution of 1366 × 768 pixels
and a vertical refresh rate of 60Hz. A single white square field
flickered at 10 Hz. For each trial, duty cycle could be defined
by:
where time period,
, in the
experiment we set
to be 0.7, 0.5 and 0.3 as shown in Fig.1.
The subjects observed the visual stimulus for ten trials. Then,
the recorded SSVEP signal was off-line analyzed with Matlab
(MathWorks) R2010b by the follow approaches:
A. Short-Time Fourier Transform
The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) was used to
determine the spatial-temporal content, i.e., peak magnitude,
peak frequency, peak time, and spectral coherence. In the

phase difference [11]. Values of (3) range from 0 to 1, where
a value of 1 indicates that the two channels preserve the perfect phase synchronization, whereas a value closer to 0 indicates that the phase becomes more independent of each other.

The time-frequency results are shown in Fig. 2. For determining STFT, the 128-point FFT based Hamming window
with overlapping interval of 64 points was computed consecutively. Fig. 3 shows typical temporal waveform of SSVPs
related to each duty cycle. In our study, the peak magnitudes
were normalized. It should be noted that these peaks were
rather seen in individual subjects than in the average. The
average peak times were detected from the stimulus epoch
from all subjects. All peak magnitudes were found in the
alpha band (8-12 Hz). The peak times of corresponding peak

magnitudes were 0.43 ms, 0.51 ms, and 0.48 ms for D=0.7,
D=0.5, and D=0.3, respectively. It was difficult to detect a
peak time from individual subject's visual responses. However, the obtained results were statistically significant in terms
of magnitude and coherence in frequency bands. The obtained
results are shown in Tables I and II. In Table I, the peak magnitudes were found in alpha band for both D=0.7 and 0.5. The
peak magnitudes at D=0.3 are similar in two frequency bands,
i.e., alpha and beta.

SSVEP amplitude and is comfortable to view is needed. Another important issue for SSVEP experiment through LCD is
that the usual refresh rate currently limited to 60Hz. Due to
the limit of the vertical refresh rate in current LCD screens,
the number of frequencies for displaying flickering objects is
limited [10].

Our results are consistent with the other studies that the
amplitude of the first harmonic depends on the duty cycle.
Visual stimuli lower than the critical flicker-fusion frequency
may make subjects to feel flicker jerky and cause visual discomfort [12]. The SSVEP power and the effects of attention
on SSVEP power strongly depend on flicker frequencies in
the delta band (2-4 Hz), and in the upper alpha band (10-11
Hz) [13].
Coherence analysis: Table II shows the maximum coherence and corresponding frequency. The results showed that
the difference in coherence between duty cycles was statistically significant in the theta and alpha bands for all selected
duty cycles (p < 0.001; Fig. 4). Based on these results, we
recommend the optimal range of duty cycle D  0.5 as a feature for potential SSVEP-based applications. This is because
the visual stimuli presented to an observer may have a direct
impact on the efficiency of SSVEP response detection method. Accordingly, an SSVEP technique that achieves the high

We investigated the SSVEP with duty cycle changes 0.7,
0.5 and 0.3 from EEG recording based on time-frequency
analysis including peak magnitude, peak frequency, and spectral coherence. The results showed that the difference in coherence in the theta and alpha bands was statistically significant and the duty cycle may be recommended for potential
SSVEP-based applications. For the future work, we plan to
apply different duty cycle for implementing multi-command
SSVEP-based system.
