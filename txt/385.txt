PSYCHIATRY IN THE DIGITAL AGE (JS LUO, SECTION EDITOR)

New Measures of Mental State and Behavior Based on Data
Collected From Sensors, Smartphones, and the Internet
Tasha Glenn & Scott Monteith

# Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014

Abstract With the rapid and ubiquitous acceptance of new
technologies, algorithms will be used to estimate new measures of mental state and behavior based on digital data. The
algorithms will analyze data collected from sensors in
smartphones and wearable technology, and data collected
from Internet and smartphone usage and activities. In the
future, new medical measures that assist with the screening,
diagnosis, and monitoring of psychiatric disorders will be
available despite unresolved reliability, usability, and privacy
issues. At the same time, similar non-medical commercial
measures of mental state are being developed primarily for
targeted advertising. There are societal and ethical implications related to the use of these measures of mental state and
behavior for both medical and non-medical purposes.

Introduction
Today, psychiatrists rely on patient history and observation,
objective data such as laboratory tests, and clinical judgment
to diagnose mental illness and assess treatment. There is
renewed emphasis on finding additional objective measures

to assist with these challenges [1, 2]. A biomarker is an
objective measure of a normal biological process, pathogenic
processes, or response to a therapeutic intervention [3, 4].
Categories of potential psychiatric biomarkers include genetic, proteins or other molecules, or neuroimaging findings [1, 5,
6]. With the rapid emergence and acceptance of digital technologies, alternative measures of mental state and behavior are
being developed for screening, diagnosis, and monitoring. In
contrast to symptoms reported by patients directly to psychiatrists, these measures will be based on data collected from
diverse sensors within smartphones, devices, and wearable
technology, as well as data collected from smartphone and
Internet usage and activities. Algorithms will be used to
analyze the collected data to estimate mental health and behavior. In the future, the new measures of mental state and
behavior will be available not only from regulated products
with scientifically demonstrated clinical utility, but also from
unregulated applications aimed at consumers and businesses.
Regardless of whether these alternative measures are considered biomarkers, the new measures are coming and will
impact psychiatry.

The Coming Age of Pervasive Healthcare
Ubiquitous computing and ubiquitous communications are
behind the upcoming measures of mental state and behavior.
In 1991, Mark Weiser of Xerox PARC noted that “the most
profound technologies are those that disappear” and predicted
that computing elements would become so ubiquitous that no
one would notice their presence [7]. We are quickly moving
toward that vision [8] as about 5 % of man-made objects now
contain embedded microprocessors [9]. Cell phones are
viewed as such an essential part of life that many feel uncomfortable or inadequate without them [10, 11]. Ubiquitous
communications, or the ability to communicate anytime and

523, Page 2 of 10

anywhere, was enabled by the recent expansion of wireless
communications and ad hoc networking [12]. By 2020, Cisco
Systems estimates that there will be 50 billion devices and
objects connected to the Internet [13] for a world population
estimated to be 7.5 billion [14]. One predicted result of this
extraordinary growth in computing is pervasive healthcare or
the access to healthcare applications for anyone, anytime [12,
15, 16]. A major component of pervasive healthcare will be
remote disease monitoring, including mental state and behavior [15, 16], with the US market for remote disease monitoring
projected to reach $22.5 billion by 2015 [17].

Potential Benefits for Psychiatry
Although the majority of remote disease monitoring efforts
are focused upon somatic illnesses, research into new measures and monitoring for psychiatry is increasing. New measures may help to prevent the frequent long time lag between
symptom onset and diagnosis, which is of particular importance as earlier intervention may lead to a better outcome in
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [18–20]. There is a need
for unobtrusive, easy-to-use, and inexpensive technologies to
provide objective information about the symptoms that patients frequently do not report accurately. For example, about
40–70 % of patients do not adhere with treatment regimens for
psychiatric medications [21, 22]. Psychiatric medications containing ingestible sensors will provide data on exactly when
the medications were taken [23•]. There is only moderate
correlation between self-reported and objective measures of
sleep [24], and technologies will provide an understanding of
sleep behaviors and patterns. Some objective measures will
assist with diagnostic challenges due to overlapping symptoms and similar clinical presentations of many psychiatric
disorders [25]. Other objective measures will help track the
progression of gradually changing symptoms like cognition,
and technology may help some patients with cognitive impairment to live independently [26, 27].

Data Collected From Sensors
The embedded computing element most critical to the expansion of pervasive healthcare computing is sensors. A wide
range of intelligent, lightweight, ultra-low-power, and lowcost sensors are now available for medical monitoring [28,
29]. These sensors are embedded in smartphones; are wearable (embedded in clothing), implantable, and ingestible; and
are placed in the home including in walls and floors [30–32].
A typical smartphone contains multiple sensors such as internal motion (accelerometer), ambient light, gyroscopic, gesture, magnetometer, temperature and humidity, and barometer.
The communication interfaces commonly found on a
smartphone are Wi-Fi, GPS, near field communications
(NFC), Bluetooth, and infrared (IR) LED. Many additional
sensors are available for physiological measurements [33].
Research into the use of physiologic sensors to measure
emotion is increasing, including skin conductivity, heart rate,
respiration, blood pressure, ECG, EEG, and EMG [34].
Data Collected From Internet and Smartphone Activities
Measures of smartphone activities that are input into medical
algorithms include details on incoming and outgoing call
frequency, duration, and contacts [35]. Measures of Internet
activities include details on search queries, pages visited,
website type, advertising selected, and e-commerce history
[36]. The content of user-created data such as emails, SMS
(text messages), social media, or blogs can be analyzed [37•].
Additionally, metadata (information about information) are
created for transactions from a smartphone or the Internet,
which includes account numbers, login IDs, passwords,
browser types, IP addresses, web pages visited, date, time,
email sender and recipient, cookies, and device fingerprints
[38].

Potential New Measures for Psychiatry

Basis for New Measures for Psychiatry
Many measures are currently being investigated by medical
researchers for use in psychiatry, including analysis of speech,
facial expression, gesture, posture, movement, eye tracking, as
well as Internet and smartphone behavior and activity. Two
general classes of data are fundamental to these measures of
mental state and behavior: (1) data collected from sensors and
(2) data collected from Internet and smartphone activities.
Algorithms are used to estimate the measures based on the
collected data.

Table 1 provides examples of medical research for psychiatry.
These measures have the potential to provide similar benefits
to psychiatry that are associated with traditional biomarkers in
relation to screening, diagnosis, and monitoring. Many of
these systems are prototypes, and measures of emotion and
behavior discovered in controlled medical or research conditions may not be suitable for natural settings. Future measures
that are able to successfully integrate multiple modalities, such
as speech and facial expression, are expected to be more
precise at identifying emotion and behavior [39].
Additionally, combining the results of multiple measurements
may increase diagnostic accuracy [40].

Establish Clinical Utility

Patient Issues

As with any candidate biomarker, all new measures of mental
state and behavior need to be thoroughly evaluated for use in
routine clinical practice. To have clinical utility, the measure
should add new information or clinical value to the information that is already available, and should be cost-effective [41].
Depending on the planned role of the measure such as screening, diagnosis, or monitoring, evaluation may include tests of
reliability (repeatability in the same and different settings),
validity (sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values), discrimination (receiver operator curves), association (relative
risk), and cost-effectiveness analysis [41].
The process to establish clinical utility for biomarkers can
be long and difficult [41, 42]. Initial studies of new measures
often use small, highly selected samples, and results may not
be generalizable to other clinical samples [42]. These small
studies may also overrepresent the prevalence of the disease as
compared with the general population, and results of validity
analyses vary with the prevalence [43]. Confounders that may
alter the results of the measurement need to be identified for
each planned role of the measure [44]. Additionally, new
diagnostic or predictive measures that are correlated with
currently available measures may not provide additional clinical benefit [40, 45].

Patient Technical Skill
Many people with mental illness may not have regular access
to smartphones or the Internet or may lack the technical skills
to use these effectively [46]. Usability of the monitoring
device is critical, and the patient should receive detailed
training. The product should be simple to operate and maintain, and designed for the technical skill level of an average
patient who suffers from the targeted mental illness [12]. All
home monitoring systems require some effort and discipline,
and patient errors are a problem in general medical monitoring
systems, such as inadequately recharging smartphone systems, wearing sensors incorrectly, and turning connections
off [47•, 48, 49].
Patient Interest Level
The successful use of remote monitoring devices is completely dependent on the cooperation of the patient. While some
patients find that remote monitoring allows them to feel more
control over their illness, others may resist even if they can
easily use the technology. Some patients with chronic illness
feel overwhelmed by their treatment burdens, do not want the

523, Page 4 of 10

added responsibility of self-monitoring [50], or prefer not to
have a constant reminder that they are ill [51]. Some patients
will become annoyed by the effort involved or lose interest
and stop monitoring. Other patients may be unable to cope
with the routine technological issues when experiencing
symptoms [52].

Technology Issues
Sensor Issues
There are reliability problems with remote disease monitoring
related to data quality and transmission delays [53]. The
limiting characteristics of sensors include battery life, memory
capacity, and difficulties with the patient-sensor interface [54,
55]. With wearable sensor systems, there are problems related
to user comfort, sensor location in garments, quality of skin
contact, and power consumption [53, 55]. Many wearable
sensor systems were designed for use by the elderly, and the
preferences of those with mental illnesses need to be considered. Unlike in a healthcare setting, remote measurements will
not be repeated by a technician if a reading is invalid. In
addition to sensor malfunctions and communication problems, real-world user activities can interfere with interpretation of collected sensor data. For example, motion artifacts can
impact the quality of heart rate and respiration measurements
[47•], sweat from exercise can require recalibration of body
worn sensors [31], and ambient noise can impact smartphone
voice analysis [56]. Walls and other obstructions in homes can
interfere with wireless communications.
Data collected from remote monitoring systems can be
obtained at irregular time intervals, often in asynchronous
bursts and in different contexts. The software must be able
to differentiate hardware and software malfunctions from
medical abnormalities. Current algorithms to analyze data
from remote physiological sensors focus on anomaly detection, prediction, and decision making, especially when used
for continuous monitoring, and many issues remain [57].
Internet and Smartphone Issues
There are also concerns about the algorithms used to estimate
mental state based on Internet and smartphone data and activities. People vary greatly in their mobile habits, and assessment algorithms based primarily on smartphone usage may
not work well for light smartphone users [58]. Analysis of data
from social media such as Twitter, Facebook, and blogs must
find a few relevant messages among the hundreds of millions
of messages sent daily [59]. The content of these messages
and other social media is noisy unstructured text that varies
tremendously in quality, and automatic text analysis

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2014) 16:523

algorithms are used to separate the high-quality content [60].
Since different methodologies are used to filter, remove noise,
parse and identify emotions, and create user profiles from
social media [37•, 59, 61, 62•], inconsistent results would be
expected among vendors. Additionally, algorithms combine
various additional data elements with the social media to
improve results. Many accounts on social media are fake,
including an estimated 67 million accounts on Facebook
[63] and 20 million accounts on Twitter in 2013 [64].
Finally, not all demographic groups use social media with
the same frequency. In a national US survey in 2013, 67 %
of all adult Internet users accessed any social networking site,
with those aged 18–29 the most likely to do so (83 %) [65].
Context Awareness and Data Interpretation
A critical issue in the interpretation of data for monitoring of
mental health is the user’s context. The implicit situational
information found in human-human interactions is not automatically present in human-computer interactions. This contextual awareness can lead to a change in interpretation of
data, such that the relevancy and importance of the information depends on the situation, and should be included in all
algorithms [66–68]. As an example, one software framework
to identify context establishes three entities (people, places,
and things) that are described by four categories (identity,
location, status or activity, and time) [68]. Both indoor and
outdoor location sensings are now possible using
smartphones, wristwatches, and sensors [69]. With contextaware software, the presentation of information, execution of
services, and tagging of data elements will vary with the
context [68]. While context awareness should improve the
quality and clinical usefulness of mental health monitoring,
the required convergence of simultaneous measurements such
as of activity and vital signs will also increase both the volume
of data collected and the processing requirements [66].

Security and Privacy
The security and privacy aspects of systems for monitoring
mental state and behavior are critical for public acceptance
and an area of considerable concern [70, 71]. The medical data
must be accurate and reliable, accessible only by those authorized to do so, and comply with all state and federal privacy
regulations including HIPAA. In addition to the complex
security challenges associated with medical data, there are
many inherent security risks with mobile users, wireless networks, shared resources, and shared control of monitoring
systems [47•, 53, 70, 72]. Most breaches of medical data
involve mobile devices [73], and there is a very high risk for
medical data on smartphones or laptops to reach unauthorized

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2014) 16:523

users. In 2013, 3.1 million smartphones were stolen, and only
54 % of smartphone users either set a PIN code to lock the
screen or used encryption [74]. In a 2008 study of 106 US
airports, 12,255 laptops were lost per week, and 55 % of
travelers used no security protections [75]. Monitoring systems must also be designed and operated to address the threat
of intentional attacks [47•].

Expression Recognition Toolkit (CERT) for classifying
emotions from facial expressions [91]. Some products to
analyze human emotion are currently on the marketplace.
Emotient and Affdex based on facial expression analysis,
and Moodies based on voice analysis, are currently being
sold to businesses to analyze customer emotional response
[92–94]. NeuroSky and Emotiv, based on EEG, are currently being sold to consumers to optimize brain fitness
[95, 96].

Large Influx of New Data
The information flowing from the sensors has the potential to create a massive volume of data [71]. The
scalability of the monitoring systems in terms of both
processing power and volume of data to be stored and
analyzed will become a critical issue as large numbers
of patients start to use these systems [31, 53]. Systems
that function in clinical environments will require an IT
organization to receive and process the patient data and
transfer the results to the psychiatrists.

Measures for Non-medical Commercial Uses
There is widespread non-medical commercial research into
computer recognition of human emotion and behavior. The
future of human-computer interaction envisions flexible
computers that are capable of identifying and tracking
people and then adapting and responding to user moods,
preferences, and intentions [76–79]. Commercial research
to recognize emotion and behavior is focused on developing subtle, continuous, real-time, and context-specific interpretations of human affective displays and on combining multiple modalities to improve results [79, 80, 81•,
82]. A range of commercial applications for computer
recognition of human emotion and behavior are
envisioned. These include improving the effectiveness of
targeted advertising [83–85], improving the humancomputer interface for standard devices such as home
appliances [77, 86], developing robotic devices that
can have human-like interactions [79, 87], expanding
the use of computers in tedious but attention-requiring
tasks such as surveillance work [76, 82, 87], recognizing human emotions to improve safety such as when
driving [88], for intelligent tutors in education [89] and
for entertainment.
Table 2 provides examples of non-medical commercial
emotion- and behavior-related research, although much of
this is proprietary. Other technologies being developed
include EmotionML, a proposed standard for an emotion
markup language to allow software to respond to the
detected emotional state of the user from the World
Wide Web consortium (W3C) [90], and the Computer

Ethical and Societal Issues
Concerns With Medical Measures for Psychiatry
There are many ethical and societal questions associated with
the medical measurements of mental state and behavior.
Psychiatric profiling will identify some individuals as being
at high risk and requiring special intervention. This is especially troubling when children are involved, as a high-risk
label may shape individual self-perception and societal attitudes about a child [1]. A label of being at high risk for mental
illness could also lead to discrimination by employers,
lenders, insurance companies, and even volunteer organizations [97].
Patients using remote monitoring should have a clear understanding of how to obtain help in emergency situations, and
of the standard turnaround time for a response to incoming
messages or data [98]. Some patients with a remote monitor
may incorrectly expect an immediate response to their digital
transmissions whenever they are in trouble [98]. If a patient’s
daily activities are being monitored, the patients should agree to
which specific activities are included [99]. There are additional
ethical considerations regarding the use of surveillance technologies for individuals with cognitive impairment [100].
Concerns With Measures for Non-medical Commercial Use
There are many areas of concern related to the non-medical
commercial estimates of mental state and behavior. Physicians
are obligated to act in the best interests of their patients, but
commercial application vendors and data brokers are not
involved in patient care and have no such obligation.
The vendors of most applications and devices sold to
consumers do not need to demonstrate efficacy or safety
[101], as these products are not regulated by the FDA
[102]. Many consumers may not be aware that data
from applications not directly accessed by medical providers are also outside of the scope of HIPAA protections and may be sold to third parties [103]. Users may
also not understand the sensitivity of some data, such as
from the commercial EEG products, which can be used
as a unique personal identifier [104].

Commercial organizations that monitor people’s everyday
health-related habits, along with their daily activities, can
combine this with other data obtained from data brokers to
estimate mental state and behavior. Initially, the most frequent
use of the estimates of emotional state and behaviors may be
to profile individuals for sales purposes [105]. However, there
are many possible implications if commercial organizations
define and detect profiles associated with mental illnesses.
Without their knowledge or active participation, people
could be branded and blacklisted by an algorithm.
Targeted advertising for health-related products may influence medical choices [106] and contain incorrect
content that may mislead, offer false hope of cure
[107], or result in delays in seeking established treatment. Furthermore, the algorithms used by the commercial companies for health analyses are not published,
may be incorrect, and cannot be duplicated [108]. If
these algorithms are considered trade secrets, legal protections will suppress this information from the public,
even though building on the published findings of

Conclusions
New measures of mental state and behavior that are generated
using technology and analytics are coming to psychiatry. In
the future, clinically useful measures will help with the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric disorders, and
there will be continued advances in this emerging field.
There are many technical issues to resolve, primarily relating
to reliability, usability, privacy, and clinical utility of the new
measures. At the same time, the use of non-medical commercial products based on similar measures will become pervasive. Society must address the ethical issues associated with
measures of mental state and behavior for medical and nonmedical use.
