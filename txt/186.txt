ABSTRACT
This paper evaluates the performance of classification of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data
by focusing on several normalization and dimensionality reduction processes in Power
Spectral Density (PSD) signal pre-processing.
pre
It focuses on effect of modification of PSD
features as an input for classification of EEG signals. For
or ANN classification, Zero-mean
normalization method produces the best performance when compared against other
complicated dimensionality reduction techniques such as Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)
and Orthogonal Least Squares (OLS). The improvement achieved by Zero-mean
normalization in ANN is 4.5% better than Baseline
B
PSD. For
or SVM classification, PCA
produces best performance with an enhancement as much as 10% better than B
Baseline PSD. It
found that SVM
M classifier performs significantly better than ANN classifier in classifying
variants of PSD features.

1. INTRODUCTION
The brain of a human is usually referred as a wonderful and the most powerful processor in
the world. To protect the precious processor, the skin and the skull in the head are the one
who responsible for the role. Nonetheless, these organs are recognized as one of the excellent
electrical insulators and making the recording of data from a single neuron in the brain is
almost impossible to be done without any special device. To develop this device, a lot of
research has been done. In 1930s, Hans Berger, the first human who discovered a new method
named ‘Electroencephalography’ (EEG) [1] to collect the signal from the neurons in the brain
and he is the first human subject being tested using EEG.
EEG is signals that provide ample information regarding the electrical activity of human brain.
The method requires the process of capturing or recording the electrical signals from the
neurons in the brain needs to be executed from scalp, where the frequency and the amplitudes
will be varies according to the current task that being done by the brain. Thereby, another
application can be used to recognize and classify the signals is the Brain Computer Interface
(BCI). BCI is an artificial intelligence system that combine both hardware and software of the
communication system and capable to recognize a certain set of patterns in the signals of the
brain comprising of five stages which are the signal acquisition, preprocessing or signal
enhancement, feature extraction, classification and the control interface [2, 22]. Table 1 states
the roles on the five stages.
BCI device can read mental commands represented by EEG signals and transforming them
into real commands which can be used in many autonomous applications. Some of the
applications of BCI are wheelchair control [3-4], unmanned aerial vehicle [5-6], home
appliances [7] , robot [8] and vehicle control approaches [9-10]. One of the most important
components of BCI is the feature extraction of EEG signals. The performance of classification
of mental tasks relies heavily on this procedure, where methods such as Power Spectral
Density (PSD) and Power Spectral Entropy (PSE) [10] are used.
This paper aims to identify the classification performance of PSD between two type of
features; raw PSD and modified PSD features which can be achieved through several
dimensionality reduction and normalization techniques that uses a compact feature vector
re-mapping that represents the unique or interesting specifications of an image or data [11].
We propose to use Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) as
the classifier. However, since the process of the EEG signal acquisition are challenging,

several studies are required prior classification.

Control Interface

Translate the signals that have been classified into meaningful and
useful commands to be used for the developments of new devices.

PSD is one of the powerful methods to identify the repetitive and correlated signals [12-13].
Generally, PSD describes how the power of a signal is distributed with frequency. The power
spectral density are shows the strength of the variations (energy) as a function of frequency
[14]. The computed data using PSD are known as periodogram. Power Spectral Density is
mainly used to analyze the location of alpha rhythm. It is observed that when the location of
electrode is changed from frontal to parietal lobes, the peak of alpha rhythm is decrease. The
person with closed eyes have more dominant wave of alpha rhythm over the back of the head
[11].
Fig. 1 shows the Emotiv EPOC with 16 sensors, one which is being used in our experiment
for the data acquisition process. The shape of this device is similar with headphones and there
are 16 independent sensors attached to the Emotiv EPOC (only 14 are used in the experiment).
These sensors consist of felt pads with gold connections to increase the sensitivity of the
pickups. One of the challenges of using this device is that the felt sensors need to be moist at
all time during the process of data acquisition to conduct the potential difference across the
skull and the solution that can be used is the saline solution [15-16].
The signals were recorded and executed to analyze the accuracy of classification of two
actions-lifting left and right hand-based on many variants PSD features. To acquire the raw
PSD features, the data will undergo the feature extraction process which is the Power Density

Spectrum. Table 2 explains briefly on the different bands of EEG signal together with their
frequency ranges and activities description. Next, the extracted data will then be transferred
into ANN and SVM classifier to obtain the classification accuracy of PSD features.

2. METHODOLOGY
2.1. Overall Working Principle for EEG Signal
This section presents on the sequence procedures adopted in this paper. Fig. 2 shows the
flowchart for overall process that being carried out in this paper. The further detail regarding
different stage in this flowchart was elaborated in the section below.
2.2. Experimental Procedure to Acquire Raw EEG Data
In this work, the experiment is conducted in which a person is asked to lift their left or right
hand for 30 seconds with eyes opened. Further explanation of the experiment is shown in
Table 3.
2.3. Filtering
The feature extraction process begins with the implementation of band pass filtering in order
to remove any unwanted noise and artefacts. Artefacts such as eye-blinking,
electrocardiograms (ECGs), breathing from respiratory system and any other internal or
external noise will affect the result analysis. Hence, we use band pass filter to filter out the

F. H. K. Zaman et al.

834

unwanted noise and signal. In this experiment, raw data has been filtered from 25 to 35
seconds to have accurate value for EEG signal when the changes take place.
2.4. Feature Extraction
The performance of the classification is dependent on the feature extraction since the
extracted features from EEG signal will help classifier to classify the different mental tasks
based on the different patterns captured in the EEG signal. In this work, PSD is used as
feature extraction method. PSD values are computed by using the mean data ratio of each
band. The dimensionality reduction and normalization of PSD data is carried out using
magnitude scaling (mag-scale) (1), softmax scaling (2), Zero-mean normalization (3), outliers
removal by Orthogonal Least Squares (OLS) [17], dimensionality reduction using Locally
Linear Embedding (LLE) [18] and Principal Component Analysis (PCA):

2.5. Classification Using ANN and SVM
In this paper, ANN is constructed and later evaluated for accuracy, specificity and sensitivity
in classifying the given EEG signal data in the form of PSD feature values. MATLAB and
Simulink Toolbox will be used especially for signal processing purpose. For SVM, LibSVM
toolbox [19] is used to simplify the implementation in MATLAB. The number of input
features are determined based on the number of input nodes, while the number of different
target function (1 output: left or right) determine the number of output nodes.

ANN can be classified either as Single-layer Perceptron or Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural
Network (MLPNN). SLP is known to have many limitations and in this regards some
researchers have found that combining the single perceptron might be useful for a larger
network. Thus, for our study, MLPNN is believed to provide a better solution. The number of
inputs denotes the number of features selected, while the number of outputs denotes the
number of classes formed.
We can see that there is for input signal which is alpha, beta, theta and delta frequency band.
The number of neurons in hidden layer use is set between range 5 to 100 for all the data set to
determine, which number of hidden layer neurons that will produce the highest accuracy. The
number of output neuron is 2 since we have two different classes which is left and right.
2.6. Performance Evaluation
After the EEG signal has been classified, we need to evaluate the accuracy of the PSD feature
classification for both ANN and SVM classifier. The result obtained is in term of accuracy
inside the confusion matrix as shown in Fig. 3.

Fig.3. Confusion matrix
We use confusion matrix to validate the data classification performance. There are two output
classes which are left or right command. We are producing three set of confusion matrix
based on the physical, imaginary and combination of both data. To illustrate, there are 4 terms
used inside the confusion matrix which are True Positive (TP), False Negative (FN), False
Positive (FP) and True Negative (TN). We set zero as the right hand, whiles the one as the left
hand. To elaborate, TP is the section where the network predicted right command and the
subject were doing the right command activity while TN is the section when the network
predicted left command and the subject were doing the left command activity. For FP also
known as “Type I error” section is when the network predicted right command, but the
subject was doing the left command activity while FN also known as “Type II error” section
is when the network predicted left command but the subject was doing the right command
activity.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This section will further discuss on the findings that we acquired when conducting the
experiment. After the data is being extracted using PSD, the data is processed with several
feature extraction and normalization techniques before being fed as an input for MLPNN and
SVM Classifier. MLPNN is one of the common classification methods in data mining.
MLPNN is a feed forward network that makes a model to map input data to output data.
Hidden layer in MLP can include various layers between input and output.
Besides the EEG data acquired from Emotive Epoc BCI device, we use another publicly
available dataset provided by IDIAP Research Institute [20] which is available from the link
here: http://bbci.de/competition/iii/desc_V.html. This dataset contains data from 3 normal
subjects during 4 non-feedback sessions. The subjects sat in a normal chair, relaxed arms
resting on their legs. There are 3 tasks namely (1) Imagination of repetitive self-paced left
hand movements, (2) Imagination of repetitive self-paced right hand movements, and (3)
Generation of words beginning with the same random letter. We use the pre-computed PSD

signals from subject 1 only in this experiment. We denote the manually acquired EEG data as
Dataset 1, while the other dataset as Dataset 2.
In the experiment, the accuracy of the classification is measured in 10 trials for each different
number of hidden neuron used as well as for SVM run. The average accuracy from MLPNN
and SVM classification for Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 is then recorded in Table 4, Table 5 and
Table 6 respectively. The parameters used in this experiment are as follows: for MLPNN,
scaled conjugate gradient is used as learning rule. SVM configuration is set such that the
nu-SVC type and RBF kernel is used. The datasets are randomly divided such that 50% of the
data is used as training set, 20% used as validation set and 30% used as test set. The number
of retained OLS features are 30, while the retained features for LLE is 10 and its
neighbourhood K is 10. For PCA, the number of retained features is 10.

From Table 4, it is observed that feature modification process produces better performance
compared to the raw PSD features (shown in Table 4 as ‘Baseline’). The highest accuracy is
achieved by Zero-mean normalization process at 66.00% accuracy, while other methods such
as Softmax normalization and Mag-Scale normalization produces 65.00% and 64.50%
accuracy respectively. Baseline PSD feature manages to produce 61.50% accuracy, while
more complicated modification procedures such as LLE and OLS produces worse result at
60.50% accuracy for both. It is observed that Zero-mean normalization produces 4.5%
improvement in term of classification accuracy when compared against Baseline PSD
(un-normalized PSD).

839

It is also observed that the number of neurons in hidden layer also plays important role is
determining the accuracy of MLPNN classification. The best number of neurons in hidden
layer for Baseline, Mag-Scale, Softmax and Zero-mean are 45, 55, 5 and 15 respectively. On
the other hand, for OLS, LLE and PCA, best performance is acquired when the number of
neurons in hidden layers are 30, 45 and 55 respectively.
According to Table 5, the best accuracy of 91.67% for SVM classifier is acquired when PSD
features are reduced using PCA. This is 10% better than Baseline PSD at 81.67% accuracy.
When compared against MLPNN classification, best performance of MLPNN which is at 66%
accuracy (Zero-mean) is much worse than SVM’s 91.67% accuracy (PCA). Based on Table 6,
the best SVM classification accuracy of 75.07% is achieved by Zero-mean normalization
which is just 1% better than Baseline PSD.
Fig. 4 and 5 show the confusion matrix and the MLPNN performance of the training,
validation, test and overall process for with unnormalized and Zero-mean PSD feature
respectively. There are 4 confusion matrices obtained when we train the network which is
training, validation, test and all. The training process presented to the network and the
network is adjusted per its error. Validation process are used for measure network
generalization and to halt training when generalization stop improving, while testing process
provide an independent measurement of network performance during and after training.

4. CONCLUSION
In summary, for MLPNN classifier, we can conclude that Zero-mean PSD feature produces
highest accuracy compared to Baseline PSD featured and other methods such as Softmax,
Mag-scale as well as other much more complicated non-linear methods such as LLE and OLS
when used in classifying Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 respectively. For SVM, PCA and Zero-mean
feature produces the best accuracy at 91.67% accuracy for Dataset 1 and Dataset 2
respectively. From the results, we found that MLPNN classification could be improved
further for since the accuracy achieved in all tested cases is less than 70% for MLPNN. SVM
classifier performs significantly better than MLPNN in classifying PSD features. The best
SVM performance for Dataset 1 is 91.67%, while the best MLPNN performance is only
66.00%. In terms of the performance improvements acquired from modifications of PSD
features, for MLPNN, Zero-mean normalization is around 5% better than baseline PSD.
While for SVM, PCA features are 10% better than baseline PSD. Feature extraction methods
other than PSD such as Power Spectral Entropy (PSE) and Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) may provide better performance, but further studies are needed to prove this. Besides,
we identify that number of neurons in hidden layer also play important role in producing the
better result in MLPNN. Finally, better technique with less computational time and high
efficiency is one of the factors that will influence better result too.
