ABSTRACT
Driver fatigue is a major issue since many people have been aware about safety degree of driving. In this
regard, this paper proposes methods and application to determine the driving fatigue state for every 3
minutes. The collected EEG data come from 30 participants that were taken their EEG data using Emotiv
EPOC+ with the duration of 33 or 60 minutes during driving simulation and their answers about the driving
fatigue states for every 3 minutes. The participant and channel outliers were determined based on the
correlation coefficient channels results with 3 highest correlation coefficient results ≤ 0,45 and the
frequency of channels shown in the 3 highest correlation with counts ≥ 7. The data that have been
determined their participant outliers will be grouped into class 1 (fit/alert) or class 2 (fatigue/sleepy). The
preprocessing and classification will use the grouped data with the selected channels. The proposed method
gives accuracy results using the KNN classification method with the maximum mean accuracy 96%,
minimum accuracy 90%, and maximum accuracy 100%; and using the SVM classification method with a
maximum mean accuracy 81%, minimum accuracy 60%, and maximum accuracy 90%.

INTRODUCTION

According to the report on October 16 2015 from
Berita Satu News, The Ministry of Health, Nila
Djuwita Moeloek said that every year in Indonesia,
400.000 people die in traffic accidents and 1.000 of
them are teenagers [1]. Another report states that
the traffic accidents in DKI Jakarta that occured
from January 2015 to May 2015 were 2.392
accidents, where one of the reasons was because of
sleepiness [2]. Based on the facts, they show that
many Indonesian people still lacks of safety
awareness, especially for the teenagers.
Fatigue and sleepiness have been measured as
connected parts in many traffic accidents [3]. In
addition, National Sleep Foundation said that
fatigue is the common meaning of the events of
being “sleepy” or ”exhausted” [4]. In accordance to
the statements, this paper categorized the
fatigueness and sleepiness as the same
measurement.

Many approaches has been done to classify the
driving fatigue state [5-9], where the majorities are
using Electroenephalography (EEG) method for the
driver fatigue detection. EEG is a method to
monitor the brain electrical activity. It is generally
used in noninvasive, i.e. a measurement technique
that does not need to be inserted into the inside of
the body [10].
EEG measure the brain electrical activitiy of the
driver using electrodes placed along the scalp which
generally called as channels. The channels record
the brain activity, i.e. brainwave over a certain
amount of time. The recorded data from the
channels then will be used for the driving fatigue
state detection.
A research has found the correlation between
drowsiness in Alpha waves with O1 and O2
channels as the significant channels using Pearson
correlation and divided the band waves into delta,
theta, alpha, beta, and gamma [11]. In the research,
they also divided the EEG data into specific waves.

Then they had tried to divide the data into 2 data
with the nearest ratio with 200:200 or called find
balance portion. After that, they labeled the first
200 data as alert data, and the others as drowsy
data, then the unbalance portion ones labeled as
outlier as and not going to be used as the source
database. The other research has found the
sleepiness influence to the decreasing of the gamma
wave and and the increasing of the alpha wave
[12]. Another research has found the statistical
significant differences between the first and the end
stages of driving in delta, theta, and beta waves in
the different brain sites (frontal, central, temporal,
parietal, and occipital) using Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) [13].
The features such as mean, median, variance,
standard deviation and mode has been used as the
features for the classification
with Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) as the feature extractor
and K-Means clustering as the divider [14] to
categorize the data into the alert state or the drowsy
state.
The other researcher used Independent
Component Analysis (ICA) as the denoising
method of the drowsiness estimation for the safety
driving [15].
In this paper, the researchers contribute in: i) find
the method to remove the participant outliers; ii)
choose the significant channels relating to the
driving fatigue states; iii) pick the features for
classification; iv) compare the classification results
between K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support
Vector Machine (SVM) classification methods; and
v) compare the accuracy results with/without the
denoising methods such as ICA or PCA using the
proposed methods. This paper could be used in
different fields, such as [16], [17], [18], [19], and
[20].

2.1.2 Standard deviation
It is used to know how spread out the data are.
The basic idea is to know the distance of data
between the average data value and each data value
as shown in the equation (1).
∑

2.1.1 Mean
It is used to know the average value of the data. It
is useful to normalized some abnormal data (noise),
so the output data will be more accurate.

2.1.3 Correlation
It is used to compute the relationship between
two data. The correlations are useful because they
could be used to predict good or bad subjects, good
or bad channels, and good data in one class or not.
The pearson correlation is one of the most widely
used to measure the correlations between data. The
equation is shown in the equation (2).

where X2n will be the even sampling frequency,
and X2n+1 will be the odd sampling frequency, so
only take one of these sampling, k is which the
column of data that will be transformed from time
domain to the frequency domain, and N is the total
length of the data input. It is very beneficially to be
used to get only the specific waves that we want.
There are five types of band waves: delta, theta,
alpha, beta, and gamma.

2.1.5 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
SVM is one of the classification method that will
represent the data as points in space, then separate
the data and divide it into categories with gaps as
far as possible by making a hyperplane. Hyperplane
made by using support vector, where the support
vector are data / object with the farthest distance
from the other data in the same class. W is the
weight vector, x is a one-dimensional array of input
data, and b is the bias.which will divide the data
with maximum distance to the hyperplane. The
illustration of the SVM classification method is
shown in the Figure 1.

marked class c if class C is the most common
classification k nearest neighbors on the dot. Near
or far neighbors are usually calculated based on
Canberra distance. The illustration of the KNN
classification method is shown in the Figure 2.

2.1.6 Canberra Distance (CD)
CD is the measurement of distance by calculating
two pieces of the data set, which will look for the
difference in the two sets of data absolutes and
divided by the sum of two sets of data in the
absolutes. This distance calculation is very sensitive
when there are small changes which both values
close to zero. The CD formula is shown in the
equation (5).

driving simulation test.

The tests will be held in 60 minutes for men and
33 minutes for women. The Figure 5 shows the
example of the driving simulation test.

2.3 Participant Requirements
The participants are recruited from the
Department of Informatics with the number
participants is 30 people. Every participant had
undergone screening criteria as follows: adults (≥
18 years with mean age 20,4 years), experienced
with riding a vehicle (minimum experience was 3
months), understand and remembered the
questionnaire, and the steps to mention the degree
of the driving fatigue state.

For every 3 minutes (it will be considered as one
trial) the participants will be asked their degree of
the driving fatigue state by mentioning it with their
fingers (1/2/3/4/5) based on the modified
Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) questionnaire.
The modified KSS questionnaire is shown in the
Figure 6.

Figure 6 The Modified KSS Questionnaire

2.4 Test Environments and Procedures
The environment of the driving simulation are as
follows:
a. The track used is a circuit.
b. Max gear is second.
c. Both hands are on the steering wheel.
d. The track used has minimum turns.
e. The body and head movement should be
minimized.
f. No traffic light.
g. The allowed transmissions are manual/semiautomatic.

If the participants feel unable to complete the
required time, the participants could raised their
hand and the driving simulation will be terminated.
2.5. Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis is used to determine the
participant outliers and find the significant
channels. The FFT was done in each data trial per
channel and get the mean and standard deviation
which will be used as the features of the data, and
do the same thing to all channels in all data trials.

After the features have been acquired, all trial
data in participants are appended, then do the
correlation between the label data from each
participant with all data trial features as illustrated
in the Figure 7.

Outliers and To Find The Significant Channels
Figure 7 Get The Features of The Trial Data In All
Participants

The boundary between the participants not
outliers and the participant outliers is the 3 highest
correlations in their channels should with the
average correlation coefficient > 0,45. If the 3
highest correlations in the participant are under the
boundary, then the participant data will be marked
as participant outliers and would not be used as the
database.

2.6. Feature Extraction
In the feature extraction process, the data will be
divided per channel, and the FFT will be done for
every channel. The TAG3 wave band mean and
standard deviation will be taken as the data
features. The extracted features will be placed in
one dimensional array for all channels. The feature
extraction process is illustrated in the Figure 9.

After all participants have been correlated, then
find the significant channels with the frequently
shown channels in 3 highest correlations from all
participants. After the frequently shown channels
have been acquired, then pick half of the channels
with count ≥ 7 of the frequently shown in the 3
highest correlations.
The methods to find the significant channels and
the participant not outliers are illustrated in the
Figure 8.

The classification process is used in the two
processes:
a. Accuracy Test.
b. Prediction.
2.7.1 Accuracy Test
The test accuracy is used to find the quality of the
classification methods, since the goals are to get
better results without preprocessing methods and to
compare between the KNN and SVM classification
method in the driving fatigue state case.
The extracted features data will be divided into
testing data and training data. The training data will
act as the database while the other ones will act as
the target data.
The testing data is trained by the training data to
determine the driving fatigue state, and the
prediction results are compared with the actual
label data to know the accuracy of the proposed
methods.

DISCUSSION

Based on the statistical analysis results in the
Table 1, it shows that the participant not outliers are
consist of 15 out of 30 participants. The reason why
the other participants are not selected is because
some of the participants were not fully
concentrating to the driving simulation, i.e. move
the body or head and the intensity of the noise in
the test room. These factors resulted in the
inequality of the concentration that cause the low
correlation between the participant EEG data and
the label. The other reason is because the
participants sometimes confused in expressing their
driving fatigue state, that could lead to the low of
correlation results.
The comparisons of accuracy results between
with the selected channels (count of frequently
shown channels ≥ 7) and classification methods are
shown in the Table 4 with MA as Mean Accuracy,
MB as Maximum Accuracy, MC as Minimum
Accuracy, and MD as Standard Deviation.

In the Figure 10 and Table 2 are shown the
significant channels based on the frequently shown
channels in the 3 highest correlation channels. The
reasons of finding the significant channels are
because of the time consumption and the influential
channels. The time consumption that needed to
process the complex data is limited, so with
choosing only the influential channels could reduce
the time cost and remove the unwanted noise.
Hence, the accuracy results get higher and the
processing time goes faster as shown in the Table 4.
Based on the accuracy test results in the Table 3
and the Figure 13, the KNN classification method is
better than the SVM classification method. The
reason is because the EEG data are distributed in a
randomize position, and the KNN classification
uses the distances between the data. Hence, it
makes the classification process become more
feasible.

mean accuracy than using SVM
classification method with a ratio of the
mean accuracy of 96% and 81%.
Using all the waves (TABG) resulted in
better accuracy with average accuracy of
96% (SVM) and 81% (KNN) compared to
using one/part of the band wave.
The accuracy results using the selected
channels (channels 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, and 13)
give better accuracy than using all of the
channels.
The proposed methods without the
denoising methods give better accuracy
results than with the denoising methods.
