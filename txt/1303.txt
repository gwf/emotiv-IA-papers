ABSTRACT
The most renowned strategy utilized for perusing mind
movement
is
electroencephalography
(EEG).
Electroencephalography is the neurophysiologic estimation of
the electrical action of the cerebrum by recording from anodes
put on the scalp, or in the exceptional cases on the cortex. The
ensuing follows are known as an electroencephalogram (EEG)
and speak to alleged brainwaves. This system is picking up
prevalence as it is a non-intrusive interface and is giving a
methodology to controlling machines through contemplations.
The proposed linking and familiarity rating method classifies
the music, video assessment responses of EEG-Signal. The
metrics namely true positive, true negative, false positive,
false negative, sensitivity, specificity and classification
accuracy are chosen for evaluating the performance of the
proposed classifier. The simulation result shows that the
proposed classifier achieves 95.4 % accuracy which is better
than other methods.

1. INTRODUCTION
The area of designing brain-computer interfaces (BCI) is
considered challenging and most desired, as it has great
potential for physically challenged persons with severe
communication and control problems [Adams et al., 2008].
The BCI provide tools that connect human brain directly to a
computer device and offers an environment that greatly differs
from the traditional way of communication. Generally
electroencephalography EEG method is used for reading brain
activity. Electroencephalography is the neurophysiologic
measurement of the electrical activity of the brain by
recording from electrodes placed on the scalp, or in the
special cases on the cortex. The resulting traces are known as
an electroencephalogram (EEG) and represent so-called
brainwaves. This method is gaining popularity as it is a noninvasive interface and is providing an approach for controlling
computers through thoughts.
Listening to music is one of the most common forms of
interaction between users and multimedia devices
(Zajonc.,1968, Borstein.,1989). Often, users rate and file
songs according to their personal taste or even receive
suggestions for potentially favorite musical content. The
incorporation of the latter aspect of musical experience, i.e.,
music appreciation, in bio-inspired systems, and especially
brain computer interfaces (BCIs), fosters the establishment of
a direct pathway between brain processes and multimedia
interfaces, which would prospectively assist the integration of

a more holistic experience of music in the everyday life of
patients suffering from cognitive or motor impairments.
The normal way to accept input is through keyboards and
mouse, which require operations made by a user.
Communication and feedback is usually achieved through
verbal (audio) or visual elements like links and pictures.
Usability analysis is an area that is directed at making this
communication comfortable. Persons with physical inability
find it more difficult to access the various parts of a screen
and, because of their inability, find it very difficult to provide
a feedback on their using experience. A solution to this is to
use the concept of Brain- Computer Interface devices to
connect computers with severely disabled individuals to
develop effective and efficient communication interface.
Thus, the primary objective of the research work is to develop
a BCI, which can be used by motion disabled people (e.g.
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, cerebral palsy
and spinal cord injury) and study their user experience for
usability analysis.
The objective of this paper is to take a bio-feedback
mechanism by the way of non-invasive EEG device and to
perform binary classification task from the received EEG
signal as calm and excited status along with evaluating the
performance using performance metrics namely true positive,
true negative, false positive, false negative, sensitivity,
specificity and classification accuracy.

2. LIRERATURE REVIEW
In order for such BCI systems to be effective, parameters that
pertain to the formation of music preference should be taken
into consideration during their design. Music preference
constitutes a distinctive characteristic of our personality that is
influenced by numerous and varying factors, which mainly
originate from our social and cultural background.
Nevertheless, a common and well- established factor that
influences the shaping of music appraisal judgments is the
level of familiarity with a musical excerpt. It has been
demonstrated that even mere exposure to a particular stimulus
can manipulate the degree of liking. In general, familiar
stimuli tend to be more liked by subjects, although; over
familiarization can result into negative judgments. This
evidence implies an inverted U-shaped function of liking with
respect to exposure. Unfamiliar stimuli are mapped to a high
arousal potential and as familiarization takes place this
potential decreases, causing liking to increase until an optimal
level. Aspects of the latter effects in response to musical
stimuli, and especially the U-shaped model, have been
corroborated by several studies (Schellenberg et al.,2008,
Hunter Schellenberg.,2010). Probing further, liking for music
is mainly interpreted in terms of affective experiences. As
music is a dynamic process, the content of which fluctuates

6

Volume 116 – No. 10, April 2015
over time, the affective phenomena that it elicits, and,
consequently, appraisal judgments, should also be considered
as such processes (Bachorik et al.,2009). Since familiarity
influences the shaping of music preference, it is expected to
affect the unfolding of appraisal events over time, i.e., such
events may peak in different time intervals during listening,
depending on the familiarity with each excerpt. Research on
the time course of affective responses to music has gained
much interest over the past years. Musical excerpt is long can
be categorized by subjects, with respect to their emotional
content, in a similar way as much longer excerpts. Based on
two- dimensional emotional ratings on average, a listener
requires 8.31s of music before initiating an emotional
judgment. The classification of electroencephalogram (EEG)
responses to liked/disliked music was investigated by the
broad researchers. Time-frequency (TF) analyses, energyrelated features were estimated from EEG signals acquired
from subjects during the listening of 15s long musical
excerpts (Bachorik et al.,2009). Best classification accuracy
(CA) {86.52(±0.76)%} obtained by the combination of
features from the beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma EEG bands (3149 Hz), estimated in the total duration of music listening (0-15
s). Similar, but slightly lower, CA {84.94(±0.94)%} achieved
using the same features estimated in the time interval of 8-15
s after each excerpt onset. The EEG data set acquired can be
reanalyzed by implementing a time-windowing approach for
feature extraction, which is based on TF analysis
(Hadjidimitriou and Hadjileontiadis.,2012).

3. PROPOSED WORK
3.1 Times-Frequency Distributions (TFDs)
A TFD constitutes a two-dimensional spectral representation
of a signal in the time and frequency domains. There are two
major classes of TFDs, i.e., the atomic decompositions (also
referred as linear TF representations) and the quadratic TF
representations. The first class involves a linear
decomposition of the signal in elementary components,
namely atoms, in order for the TFD to be acquired. An
eminent member of this class is the short-time Fourier
transform (STFT), which involves the prewindowing of a
signal 𝑥(𝑇) around a time instant t and the subsequent
calculation of the
Fourier transform for each t. The squared modulus of the
STFT defines the spectrogram (SPG), which represents the
energy distribution of the signal in the TF plane:

SPGx(t , f ) 







x( )h * (  t )e  j 2fr d

2

where h*(T-t) represents the short-time analysis window (*
denotes the complex conjugate). The major drawback of the
STFT, and consequently of the SPG, is the trade-off between
time resolution and frequency resolution. In particular, the
time-window should be relatively small for a satisfactory time
resolution, while, on the other hand, a good frequency
resolution is acquired through a narrow- band filter, i.e., a
long time window.
The second class of quadratic TF representations includes
direct distributions of the energy of a signal in the TF plane
(Auger et al.,1996, Boashash.,2003). Members of the latter
class, which verify the properties of time and frequency
covariance, form a subset of representations that is referred to
as the Cohen’s class (Cohen.,1989) and possess the following
general expression:



C (t, f )   e j 2 ( s t ) g ( , ) x(s   / 2) x * (s   / 2). e  j 2f ddsd


where t, f denote the time and frequency, respectively, x(t) is
the signal, and 𝑔(𝜉, 𝑇) is the kernel function. The kernel is a
function of the delay T and the doppler 𝜉 in the so-called
ambiguity plane. The major drawback of the quadratic TFDs
is the appearance of cross terms (interferences), which arise
from the quadratic superposition principle that the latter
distributions involve. Certain members, namely reduced
interference distributions (RIDs), of Cohen’s class target at
reducing these terms by a careful selection of the kernel
function (Zhao et al.,1990). An eminent member of the RIDs
group is the Zhao-Atlas-Marks (ZAM) distribution, which
significantly reduces cross-terms by adopting a cone- shaped
kernel function:

g ( , )  h( ) |  |

sin( )



where h(T) is a window function that leads to smoothing
along the frequency axis. Thus, the following expression
which defines the ZAM distribution can be obtained:

 t | r | / 2
  j 2fr
h
(

)
 t |r|/x2 (s  t / 2) x * (s  t / 2)ds e d




Finally, a third method for the TF representation of a signal,
which does not belong to the aforementioned classes, is the
Hilbert-Huang spectrum (HHS) (Huang et al.,1998). The latter
method consists of the empirical mode decomposition (EMD)
of a signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and the
subsequent application of the Hilbert transform on each IMF,
in order for an analytic signal to be obtained:

Z k (t )  IMFk (t )  jIMFkH (t )  Ak (t )e j k (t )
where IMFk(t) denotes the kth IMF, IMFkH t is its Hilbert
transform, Ak(t) represents the amplitude of Zk(t) represents
the instantaneous phase. Due to their generating process,
IMFs constitute narrow band components and, therefore, a
meaningful instantaneous frequency can be estimated by
1 𝑑𝜃 𝑘
the derivative of 𝜃𝑘 𝑡 i.e., 𝑓𝑘 𝑡 =
. The three2𝜋 𝑑𝑡

dimensional plot of the squared amplitude 𝐴2𝑘 (𝑡) for all IMFs,
with respect to time and instantaneous frequency fk(t), forms
the HHS-based TFD of a signal.

3.2 Time Frequency based Feature
Extraction
Features were extracted from TFDs of EEG signals. Feature
estimation was based on the concept of event-related
desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS). The
ERD/ERS theory postulates that event-related activity
could be seen as a proportional change of the EEG
spectral energy in relation to a reference period, placed
some seconds before the stimulus onset (Pfurtscheller and
Lopes da Silva.,1999). Additionally, such phenomena should
be investigated in discrete EEG frequency bands as they arise
from the intrinsic properties of neuronal populations
functioning as resonating systems in specific frequency ranges
(Niedermeyer and Lopes da Silva.,1998). Thus, after the
estimation of the TFD TF [t,f] of an EEG epoch
corresponding to the stimulation period, from recording
channel i and experimental trial j, feature F is computed in a
time window wn and in the frequency band (fb) of interest as

any resting brain activity. Feature estimation involved a timewindowing approach, i.e., features were estimated from the
TFD in consecutive overlapping time-windows. Thus, the
minimum value of the window length and the overlapping
percentage between consecutive windows had to be set.

The quantity Afb,wn is computed as the average
TFD amplitude over both frequency and time, i.e.,

where TFR[t,f] is the TFD estimated from the EEG epoch

channel i), NR is the number of samples in the latter interval,
and Nfb is the number of samples in the same frequency band
𝑓𝑏 . It must be noted here that the TFDs are computed in their
discrete forms.

According to the literature, the time interval which subjects
require to demonstrate an effective response or to assess the
emotional content of a musical piece is in the order of
seconds. As far as the EEG frequency bands are concerned,
features were estimated from the beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma
(31-49 Hz) EEG bands. The cut-off frequency for the gamma
band was set to 49 Hz by taking into consideration the final
sampling frequency of the recording device, i.e., 128 Hz,
which allows for a bandwidth of 64 Hz, as well as the
hardware and software-based online filtering which could
distort EEG data in higher frequencies. The focus was placed
upon the latter frequency bands as the combination of features
derived from them led to statistically significant higher
classification accuracies as compared to other EEG bands and,
consequently, to the best discrimination between music
appraisal responses. The TF-based feature extraction
procedure was implemented as follows (Hadjidimitriou and
Hadjileontiadis.,2013).

for each window length lwn = 1, 3, 5 s, during the course of
music listening (15 s).
Fig. 1 Schematic representation of the time-frequencybased feature extraction procedure
As it is evident from the aforementioned, a timewindowing approach for feature extraction is adopted, i.e.,
feature F is computed from the TFD in different time
windows wn, covering the total duration of the stimulation
period. Time windows are of length 𝑙𝑤 𝑛 and they are selected
to be consecutive along the time axis with a percentage of
overlapping (ov). Fig. 1 illustrates the feature extraction
process
described
above
(Hadjidimitriou
and
Hadjileontiadis.,2013). Subsequently, for each trial j, time
window wn and frequency band fb, the feature vector (FV) is
constructed as



FV j fb,wn  F j fb,1 ,wn , ... , F j fb,i ,wn , F j fb, Nc,wn



where i denotes the ith recording channel and Nc is the total
number of channels.

3.3 Feature Estimation
The filtered EEG signals were subjected to the TF-based
feature extraction procedure. For each trial, the stimulation
period was the interval of music listening (15 s), while the
reference period was the last 2 s of the resting interval
preceding the beginning of the musical excerpt. The first
second was omitted, as it succeeded subjects’ rating, to avoid

For each trial, the TFDs of the EEG epochs acquired during
the stimulation and resting periods were computed for the 14
recording channels. Subsequently, the FV for each band was
constructed. The final FV for the jth trial and the nth time
window (wn) was formed by concatenating the FV s
corresponding to the beta and gamma bands, i.e.,



FV jwn  FV jbeta, wn , FV jgamma, wn



For each channel and each of the two frequency bands, 𝑅 𝑓𝑏
was computed from the TFD corresponding to the resting
interval using FV.
Feature 𝐹 𝑓𝑏 ,𝑤 𝑛 ,was computed using 𝑅 𝑓𝑏
and 𝑓𝑏 , 𝑤𝑛 ,
estimated from the TFD corresponding to the interval of
music listening, in time window wn and in each frequency
band of interest. The complete FV set corresponding to time
window wn consisted of the FV s computed for all trials of
music listening. The total number of FV sets computed during

the time course of music listening was

the stimulation period in seconds and the fraction of
overlapping between time windows, respectively. Fig. 2
depicts the number and indices (n) of time windows wn for
each window length lwn For example, 29 FV sets were
computed during the time course of music listening using 1-slong consecutive time windows with 50 percent overlap. For

8

International Journal of Computer Applications (0975 – 8887)
Volume 116 – No. 10, April 2015
the computation of the TFDs, the three methods were
employed, i.e., the SPG, the ZAM method, and the HHS. A
64-point fast Fourier transform (FFT) with a nonoverlapped
Hamming window of 500 ms was used for the computation of
the SPG. The nonoverlapped windows were selected to
acquire completely disjoint energy estimations from the
different EEG segments.
The length of the short-time window was set to 500 ms for the
subsequent time-window segmentation, described above, to be
implemented. The ZAM distribution was computed under a N
x N TF resolution; N denotes the number of samples of the
signal.
Smoothing was performed using Hamming windows of
N=10- samples and N/4-samples for time and frequency
(Auger et al.,1996, Boashash.,2003). Finally, the HHS was
computed by implementing the EMD algorithm (Huang et
al.,1998). Fig. 3 illustrates the produced TFDs from an EEG
signal using the three TF representation methods
(Hadjidimitriou
and
Hadjileontiadis.,2013).
The
aforementioned analysis and the subsequent classification
procedure were conducted using Matlab R2011b (Mathworks
Inc., Natick, MA).

SPG (second row), the ZAM (third row), and the HHS
(fourth row) methods.

3.4 Classification
The classification approach adopted in this study was user
independent, i.e., classification was performed on the
complete data set, created from all subjects’ EEG responses.
Initially, the estimated FVs were grouped in two classes,
namely ―like‖ and ―dislike.‖ Class ―like‖ comprised of FV s
corresponding to the trials in which subjects rated their liking
for the musical excerpts as 5 (like very much) or 4 (like).
Consequently, class ―dislike‖ comprised of FV s
corresponding to the trials in which subjects rated their liking
for the musical excerpts as 2 (do not like) or 1 (do not like at
all). The FV sets were further categorized according to the
level of familiarity. FVs corresponding to trials in which
subjects rated their level of familiarity with the musical

excerpt as 5 (very familiar) or 4 (familiar) were labelled as
―familiar,‖ while FV s corresponding to trials in which
subjects rated their level of familiarity with the musical
excerpt as 2 (unfamiliar) or 1 (totally unfamiliar) were
labelled as ―unfamiliar.‖ As presented in Table 1, only few
significant high correlations between subjects’ liking and
familiarity ratings for the 60 musical excerpts were observed,
indicating that positive/negative appraisal responses were
deduced from different excerpts per listener.
In short, three types of data sets were considered: 1) the FV
sets corresponding to liking and disliking ratings of familiar
excerpts (LDF), 2) the FV sets corresponding to liking and
disliking ratings of unfamiliar excerpts (LDUF), and 3) the
FV sets corresponding to liking and disliking ratings,
regardless of familiarity (LD), i.e., the joint LDF and LDUF
FV sets. The purpose of the binary classification procedure
was to discriminate between liking and disliking responses
under the parameter of familiarity.

4. ABOUT THE DATASET
The
EEG
data
set,
by
(Hadjidimitriou
and
Hadjileontiadis.,2012), was acquired for the sake of clarity; a
summarized description of the experimental procedure is
given here. Nine subjects participated in an experiment during
which they listened to 60 15-s-long nonvocal musical excerpts
and 15 15-s-long excerpts of broadband noise, while their
brain activity was recorded. Musical excerpts belonging to the
four most common genres, i.e., rock-pop, electronic, jazz, and
classical (15 excerpts per genre), were carefully selected to
represent the intrinsic characteristics of each genre, e.g.,
colourful instrumentation for symphonic pieces, jazz scales,
and characteristic instrument textures that tie with the
definition of jazz. Consequently, a kind of uniform
stimulation of excitement per genre was anticipated for each
user, based on the objective characteristics of the music that
essentially define the genre itself. The total number of trials
was equal to the number of excerpts, i.e., 75 per subject and 9
x 75 = 675 in total. EEG signals were acquired using the
Emotiv EPOC wireless recording headset (Emotiv Systems,
Inc., San Francisco, CA) from 14 channels (AF3, F7, F3, FC5,
T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8), referenced to the
common mode sense (CMS—left mastoid)/driven right leg
(DRL—right mastoid) ground. The EEG data are acquired
with an internal sampling frequency of 2,048 Hz by the
recording device, and, subsequently, band-pass filtered in the
range of 0.16- 85 Hz using hardware filters. All EEG signals
were band-pass filtered offline in the frequency range of 1-49
Hz (Hadjidimitriou and Hadjileontiadis.,2012).

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
The following are the performance metrics used to evaluate
the performance of the two proposed classification methods
namely liking & similarity rating method. The classification is
performed by two types namely calm and excited. Sampling –
1 consists of 100 EEG signal input. The classification
accuracy, sensitivity and specificity can be calculated using
the following metrics.


True Positive is the Calm Positive



True Negative is the Calm Negative



False Positive is the Calm Excited



False Negative is the Calm Positive Negative



Neutral denotes Negative Positive [Not considered]

The most famous strategy used for perusing mind movement
is electroencephalography (EEG). Electroencephalography is
the neurophysiologic estimation of the electrical action of the
