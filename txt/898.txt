Significant advances in bio-sensors technologies hold promise to monitor human physiological signals in real
time. In the context of driving safety, such devices are knowing notable research investigations to objectively
detect early stages of driver drowsiness that impair driving performance under various conditions. Seeking
for low-cost, compact yet reliable sensing technology that can provide a solution to drowsy state problem is
challenging. The contribution of this paper is to study fundamental performance specifications required for
the design of efficient physiological signals based driver drowsiness detection systems. Existing measurement
products are then accessed and ranked following the discussed performance specifications. The finding of

Introduction

Till now, the total number of serious car crashes
is still increasing regardless of improvements in road
and vehicle design for driver safety. Reduced mental alertness due to drowsy state have been identified
as the greatest safety danger and the major cause of
road traffic accidents (Lal and Craig, 2001). While
each day in the United States 80,000 individuals fall
asleep behind the steering wheel (American Academy
of Sleep Medicine, 2005), 25-30% of driving accidents in the UK are drowsiness related (ROSPA,
2001), about 35% drivers in the Netherlands and 70%
drivers in Spain have reported falling asleep while
driving (Morales et al., 2015).
The measure of human physiological parameters
allows evaluating objectively cognitive-attentive indicators, in reaction to external perceptual stimuli. The
study of human physiology has showed that monotone driving task and nocturnal driving mostly lead to
sleep deprivation, lacking sleep, and being in a state
of low energy (Morales et al., 2015). These symptoms
decrease cognitive abilities and make driver more
prone to fatal errors. Many drowsiness measurement
technologies have been developed to monitor driving
behavior and alert drivers when drowsy.
Recently, with the remarkable advance in sensing
and communication technologies, Low-cost wearable
devices are fast becoming a key instrument on bio-

sensors based applications and they have been applied in many fields including industrial, transportation, medical, daily-life, sport, etc. There are a number of tentative promoted by shift-work industries to
monitor cognitive state of human-being using these
emerging technologies since they hold the promise
of being objective compared to other measuring technologies. These bio-signals based technologies make
it possible to alert driver at earlier stages of drowsiness and thereby prevent many drastic accidents providing a solution to the driver drowsy problem (Sahayadhas et al., 2012).
In this study, we focus in assessing recent development of bio-sensors technologies in the market that
are currently underway to address driver drowsiness
issue, and provide a concise hardware specification
tool for the design of efficient driver alertness monitoring system. In the following, the key drowsiness detection technologies are presented in section
2. Next, the general architecture of driver drowsiness monitoring system with different modules are
explained in section 3. Main performance characteristics that must be met by a drowsiness monitoring technology are discussed in section 4. Section
5 is devoted to review potential market physiological
sensors products. Ranking methodology is described
in section 6 providing a tool to make the appropriate
hardware choice of existing products. Finally, section
7 concludes the paper.

Drowsiness Detection Technologies

A plethora of driver fatigue researches exist spanning different measurement technologies. The most
commonly used measurement can be categorized
upon the monitoring instrument into: (i) Vehiclebased sensors, (ii) Video-based sensors, and (iii)
physiological signals sensors such as electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiography (ECG), and electroencephalography (EEG)
signals where the latter is the most used (Sahayadhas
et al., 2012; Sanjaya et al., 2016).
Vehicle monitoring focuses on driving and vehicle patterns such as steering wheel angles and reversals, the car position with respect the road’s middle lane and the standard deviation of lane position
(SDLP), etc. However, this technology can operate
reliably only at particular environments (Sahayadhas
et al., 2012) depending on the geometric characteristics of the road and to a lesser extent on the kinetic
characteristics of the vehicle (Vural, 2009) and they
are easily influenced by other factors such as road
marking, climate, lighting and traffic conditions.
Video monitoring measures driver’s facial expression and detect drowsiness from differentiating its
abnormal behavior such as eye closure (PERCLOS),
head nodding, etc. The common limitation is lighting. The detection rate using this technology was 59%
compared to 85% and 97.5% of EEG and ECG (Sanjaya et al., 2016). (Golz et al., 2010) reported an accuracy around 74% and 66% using PERCLOS compared to 87% and 89% from EEG/EOG.
Bio-sensors measure physiological signals from
organs such as brain, eyes, muscles, and heart which
have visual correlation with fatigues/drowsiness. Researchers observed via EEG that drivers had sleep
bursts accompanied by theta waves and K-complexes
while they still had their eyes open, something videobased monitoring might have missed. Physiological
signals have been shown to be reliable and accurate
since they are less impacted by environmental and
road conditions and thus may have fewer false positives than other measures (Zilberg et al., 2007).

System Architecture

Due to the increasing interest in the use of wearable bio-sensor systems, many communication architectures have been proposed depending on the target
application (Lee et al., 2013). The general architecture of bio-sensor system is composed by three main
modules: (i) signal acquisition, (ii) data processing,
and (iii) control modules as depicted in Fig. 1.

3.1

Acquisition Module

This module is composed of different physiological
wearable sensors such as EMG, ECG, EOG, EEG,
etc. attached to the body which measure physiological
signals. These sensors form a network and communicate with the network coordinator to send data. The
measured signals are then filtered and transformed to
remove any noise and artifact that may affect the quality of sensed data values.

3.2

Processing Module

Signals are received from acquisition module after filtering noise and removing artifacts. As second stage,
signals are processed to extract the main features that
reflect different states of the target application (e.g.
the cognitive states of driver). These features are then
passed to the training and classification algorithms
to determine the new measured states. As for driver
drowsiness, the features can be used to determine in
which level of alertness the driver is.

3.3

Control Module

Driver alertness is monitored in real time using acquisition and data processing modules. Whenever a
drowsy state is identified, the detection event is then
triggered by the control module to make the appropriate action in time. This action may be an alarm or
buzz inside the vehicle to alert or wake-up the driver.
The action may take control of the vehicle in order to
speed-down or stop the vehicle.
Many portable systems propose to incorporate the
acquisition and the processing modules into the same
component to compact the system. Hence, there is a
serious issue with the battery lifetime. In the context

4.1

Multi-Sensors Support

Single signal measurement such as EEG may necessitate dense electrode placement in different locations
to accurately capture cognitive states. Hybrid signal acquisition through simultaneous recording of different bio-signals can yield higher accuracy of the
system. Combination of multiple bio-signals measurements, such as ECG, EMG, EOG with EEG, the
system can measure not only brain waves but also
heart rate, eye movements, etc. Research results have
showed that adding either EOG or ECG measurements, there is further improvements in reduction of
error rates in drowsy state detection (Warwick et al.,
2015).

of driver drowsiness detection, the acquisition module is attached to the driver and the processing module
is installed on the vehicle which has sufficient power
supply. This allows extending the battery lifetime and
keep monitoring for long periods. The control module
is mounted on the vehicle to trigger warning messages
and sound alerts. This module can be even enabled to
control some actions of the vehicle such as acceleration and speed. The system can be extended to support multi-tiers cloud-based architecture (Zao et al.,
2014). As depicted in Fig. 2, some of data can be
transmitted via 3G/4G/LTE connections to the remote
servers where data analytic algorithms can be used to
train and extract new knowledge. This enables monitoring cognitive states during real driving tasks from
large number of drivers and may be explored by the
research community to enrich training sets and improve the accuracy of existing detection algorithms.

The choice of electrode technology is very important since it represent the sensing component. With
respect EEG measurement, wet electrodes known as
silver-chloride electrodes (Ag/AgCl) are widely used
by current market products. These electrodes are lowcost, and have low contact impedance, and good stability in time. Wet electrodes requires removing outer
skin layer of the scalp and filling a special conductor
gels which take long time to prepare and are uncomfortable to users. Dry electrodes are other technology
which do not need to use gel and skin cleaning. However the bad signal quality is their main disadvantage.
Fig. 3 shows an example of wet and dry electrodes
available in the market.

Performance Specifications

If any bio-sensors system is to prove suitable for
detecting driver drowsiness, it must meet some performance specifications. These specifications are essential in making the appropriate bio-sensors hardware
choice for design consideration. In the following, the
major specifications are discussed:

Type of Electrodes

Electrode Placement

Capturing as much as data from strategically locations
is critical to pinpointing the drowsy related causes.
For each bio-signal, there exists suitable locations
where may be placed to efficiently measure signal reflecting the drowsy state of driver. For EOG, electrodes are attached to the eye skin (up/down/left/right)
whereas for EMG, they may be placed on the left
bicep, right bicep, left forearm flexor, right forearm
flexor, frontal muscles, or on the deltoid, trapezius
Hostens and Ramon (Hostens and Ramon, 2005).

While 5 & 12 lead electrode placements are generally used for ECG recording. For EEG, the electrode
placement according to the 10-20 Standard defines
which brain location that serves a specific function
(see Fig. 4). More specifically: Prefrontal Cortex
(Fp) for emotional inhibition and attention; Frontal
Lobes (F) for working memory, metaphorical thinking, sustained attention and judgment; Central Strip
(C) for sensory-motor functions; Temporal Lobes (T)
for language comprehension and long-term memory;
Parietal Lobes (P) for language processing and procedural memory; Occipital Lobes (O) for visual processing. Thus, locations concerning various forms
of attention which reflect alertness/drowsiness states
must be covered by the hardware.

electrodes and the acquisition part. For these reasons, preparation time for measuring signals is typically very long. In addition, user movement is limited due to cable constraints. Therefore, the application of drowsiness detection based on these systems is
difficult to escape from laboratory scale experiments.
With emerging wearable technologies, biopotential
measurements, such as EEG, ECG, EMG, and EOG
can be delivered in real-time via wireless and Lowenergy connections such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee,
etc. Therefore, these provide the advantages of mobility and long-term monitoring. Portable systems facilitate the implementation of driver drowsiness detection systems and enable in-field experimentation
instead of simulation environment. However, huge
volume of signals may be sampled and need to be
transmitted wirelessly in real-time. Hence, the system
must prove energy-efficient operation for long period
to be accepted for continuous monitoring. for example, compression algorithms can be used to alleviate
big data transfer since it is time and energy consuming (Hussein et al., 2015).

4.4

Number of Channels

An electrode capturing bio-signal activity is called a
channel. Typical Bio-sensor systems can have as few
as a single channel to as many as channels (256 for
EEG) depending on the required density. The system must trade-off between capturing as much as bioactivities with some performance metrics. For instance, increasing the number of channels will have
significant delay for data processing. Second, more
channels mean higher costs and more difficult experimental setups. Lastly, by increasing the number of
channels, the huge amount of signals will be transmitted that impairs reliability and battery usage especially for mobile and low-power systems. On the
other hand, very few channels impair the accuracy of
detection.

4.5

Portability & Mobility

Conventional bio-sensors systems such as actiCHamp
(Brain Products), Neuroscan NuAmps Express (Compumedics Ltd.), and EDVTCS (Neurocom) are wired.
The acquisition part of wired systems generally
comes with bulky and heavy amplifiers and preprocessing units. Connecting wires is usually complicated with a large number of cables between the

Artifact Removal

Bio-sensors are prone to various sources of noise
and artifacts. Signal conditioning is essential to enable transmission of precise bio-signals. Many noise
sources are likely present from physiological interference and power line noise. Physiological interference
occurs between EEG, EMG, ECG, EOG and others.
The amplitude of EMG, ECG and EOG is relatively
lager around 50uV and 20-30mV while that of EEG
is much smaller around 10 100uV. Thus, the EEG signals are easily buried by these physiological signals
unavoidably. Power line noise (Outlet, USB, etc.) can
also contaminates the EEG signals in the range of 50
or 60Hz. Furthermore, the measured bio-signals of
mobile systems are also subject to heavy motion and
vibration artifacts. Hence, the presence of noise and
artifact removal mechanism is essential in such systems.

4.7

System Autonomy

Another important specification is the need of energyefficient and long-term wearing system. For systems
that use battery powered bio-sensors, the lifetime of
the system is the critical challenge to ensure continuous driver monitoring. In fact, wireless transmissions
consume the largest amount of device’s energy. Indeed, the battery autonomy may go from 4 hours to 24
hours or even more depending on the wireless technology (e.g. Bluetooth, Wifi, etc.) and on the sam-

pling rate. The system must be designed with efficient
usage of sensory and radio components to ensure reasonable monitoring lifetime.

4.8

Software

The software is one of the main part of the system.
Thus it is fundamental to have access to data in order to manipulate and/or analyze the recorded signals.
The market product may provide software development kit (SDK) as bio-signal acquisition software or
an application programming interface (APIs) compatible with some known commercial or open source biosignals software platforms (e.g. BCI 2000, OpenVibe,
LabVIEW, etc). This enables to facilitate and speedup the development of efficient detection algorithms.

4.9

Product Cost

Making a choice between products must trade-off system performance with its cost. Many of existing market devices are designed for clinical and research purpose and provide multi-sensor acquisition with a large
number of electrodes/channels and with incredible
sensitivity. The cost of such systems is visibly high
due to the full provided functionality. Depending on
the application need like driver drowsy detection, the
system cost may be reduced and can be determined
by the performance specifications such as number of
channels, sensors’ type, portability, wireless technology, flexibility, and comfort.

Products Ranking & Discussion

Notable efforts are taking place to promote biosensors technologies for pioneer applications. To
our knowledge, there exists practically very few biosensors product intended for driver drowsiness detection on the market. Most of existing products provide
bio-signals monitoring for general research usage or
for medical and neurofeadback applications such as
training, sport, gaming, etc. In the context of driving
monitoring, more efforts are needed to meet performance specifications to develop efficient drowsiness
detection system. For instance, high precision products are bulky and rely upon a large number of channels (e.g., 64-256), which is cost non-effective and
makes it difficult to do fast artifact removal. Furthermore, electrode placement is too technical due to the
requirement for electrodes, gel, wiring, etc. The use
of dry electrodes is promising to reduce the cost and
time required for data collection but novel techniques
are needed to improve the accuracy of measured signals. Lower cost products come with reduced resolution (e.g., 4-16 channels) but with increased portability. Although, these devices are cost effective and
more comfortable, they either suffer from low accuracy and require additional signal inputs such as EOG,
ECG, EMG to maintain high accuracy.
In the context of driver drowsiness detection, it
would be preferable that the bio-sensor system is less
obtrusive and composed with multiple bio-sensors especially EEG and EOG (Golz et al., 2010), with few
but sufficient number of channels, active electrodes,
low-power communication technology with acceptable sampling rate and battery autonomy. To facilitate
the choice of suitable hardware for drowsiness detection, we have ranked the reviewed bio-sensor products
in Sec. 5 using the performance specifications discussed in Sec. 4. As multiple bio-sensors are needed,
we ranked with (1,2,3,4) whenever EEG, ECG, EMG,
EOG are supported. Electrode type is ranked with 1
for wet and 2 for dry. Electrode placement is ranked
only for EEG from 1 to 6 for (Fp) (F) (C) (T) (P) (O)
locations. We ranked the number of channels with
1/2/3/4/5 for 64-256/32-64/16-32/8-16/1-8 channels.
Portability is ranked following the data transfer technology as 1/2/3/4 for USB, Wifi, BLE, RF2 . Artifact
removal is ranked with 0 or 1 for the existence of the
mechanism. Battery lifetime is ranked as 1/2/3/4/5
for 1-4/4-8/8-12/12-16/16-24 hours autonomy. The
software is ranked with 0/1/2 when the signal pro2 BLE:

cessing software is provided and wither is commercial
or open-source software. Finally, the cost is ranked
with 1/2/3/4/5 for price ranging in [50k 100k]/[25k
50k]/[10k 25k]/[1k 10k]/[0 1k]$.
Table 1 shows the results of existing bio-sensor
products ranking. It can be observed that OpenBCI, Enobio, and DSI10/20 are the top ranked products that met the required performance specifications
among others. This ranking is based on our study
of physiological based-sensors technologies and we
believe that it is not the only evaluation and ranking
method to access the performance of such technologies. Although some performance metrics were not
taken into consideration in our ranking (e.g., device
comfort), we think that the proposed ranking tool help
in choosing the most appropriate hardware products
to develop efficient drowsiness detection system.

Conclusion

Driver drowsiness poses a major danger for public
safety. Monitoring driver’s alertness is of high importance to prevent grand number of incidents. Existing
drowsiness detection technologies such as vehicle and
video-based have limited accuracy and work well in
specific conditions. Recently, a number of portable
bio-sensor devices have rapidly attracted the research
interest to circumvent the drive drowsy problem under any condition. These promising devices can objectively capture the drowsiness state by monitoring
physiological signals of drivers and alert them in realtime. However, the choice of the hardware must
trade-off some performances such as signal quality
and the cost. This paper discusses a number of performance specifications required by such systems and
rank the existing market physiological sensor products following these specifications providing the research community with a tool to make the appropriate
hardware choice for design consideration of efficient
yet low-cost driver drowsiness detection. We plan to
perform experimental comparison tests between some
existent market platforms in our research agenda.
