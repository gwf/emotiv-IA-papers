Eye state identification is a kind of common time-series classification problem which is also a hot spot in recent research.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used in eye state classification to detect human‚Äôs cognition state. Previous research has
validated the feasibility of machine learning and statistical approaches for EEG eye state classification. This paper aims to propose
a novel approach for EEG eye state identification using incremental attribute learning (IAL) based on neural networks. IAL is a
novel machine learning strategy which gradually imports and trains features one by one. Previous studies have verified that such
an approach is applicable for solving a number of pattern recognition problems. However, in these previous works, little research
on IAL focused on its application to time-series problems. Therefore, it is still unknown whether IAL can be employed to cope with
time-series problems like EEG eye state classification. Experimental results in this study demonstrates that, with proper feature
extraction and feature ordering, IAL can not only efficiently cope with time-series classification problems, but also exhibit better
classification performance in terms of classification error rates in comparison with conventional and some other approaches.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, electroencephalography (EEG) eye state classification is a very hot research area. Many studies about EEG
signals have been implemented. The findings from these
studies are important and useful for human cognitive state
classification, which are not only crucial to medical care but
also significant to some daily life tasks. For example, EEG
eye state classification has been successfully applied in the
areas of infant sleep-waking state identification [1], driving
drowsiness detection [2], epileptic seizure detection [3],
classification of bipolar mood disorder (BMD) and attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients [4], stress
features identification [5], human eye blinking detection [6],
and so on. These occurrences indicate the importance of
research on EEG eye state signal analysis.
In usual case, the data describing EEG eye state belong
to continuous type of time-series data. There are a number
of machine learning and statistical approaches which can be

employed to solve the classification problems with this timeseries data. Moreover, previous research has validated that
EEG eye state signals can be successfully analysed by some
machine learning or statistical approaches.
In this paper, incremental attribute learning (IAL), a novel
machine learning approach, is proposed to solve the EEG eye
state classification problem. IAL is a ‚Äúdivide-and-conquer‚Äù
machine learning strategy, which can be implemented by
almost all machine learning algorithms, such as neural
networks (NNs), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and
genetic algorithms (GAs). In IAL, features are gradually
imported into the system to predict the class labelling one
after the other. Because of this unique process, IAL is able to
effectively reduce the interference among features. As a result
of that, this approach can not only reduce the noise from data
but also enhance the classification accuracy and obtain better
results than some conventional approaches [7‚Äì9].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
a brief introduction to EEG eye state classification is given.

Section 3 reviews IAL and presents the preprocessing works
for the proposed EEG eye state classification approach.
The proposed approach to solve time-series EEG eye state
classification problem is presented in Section 4. Section 5
reviews the experimental benchmark problem and compares
the results with those derived by some other approaches.
Lastly, conclusions are drawn in Section 6.

2. EEG Eye State Classification
EEG signals of eye state monitoring are usually time-series
data. Therefore, in order to classify different eye states, timeseries pattern recognition approaches should be employed for
EEG eye state classification. In previous studies, a number of
different time-series approaches have been applied in EEG
eye state identification. For example, Fukuda et al. employed a
log-linearized Gaussian mixture neural network for EEG eye
state classification [10]. Yeo et al. successfully used support
vector machines (SVMs) to detect drowsiness during car
driving by eye blink [2]. Furthermore, a hybrid system based
on decision tree classifier and fast Fourier transform was
applied to the detection of epileptic seizure by Polat and
GuÃànesÃß [3]. Sulaiman et al. also employed K-nearest neighbor
(K-NN) for stress features identification [5]. In addition, Hall
et al. built a 117-second EEG eye state corpus and employed 42
different machine learning and statistical approaches based
on Weka [11] to predict eye states. They found that KStar
is the best approach among these different methods [12].
Their eye state corpus is now a benchmark problem saved
by Machine Learning Repository, University of California,
Irvine (UCI) [13]. All these works showed that machine
learning and statistical methods are feasible in solving timeseries classification for EEG eye state identification.

3. IAL and Feature Ordering
3.1. Incremental Attribute Learning. IAL is a novel ‚Äúdivideand-conquer‚Äù machine learning strategy, which gradually
imports features into predictive systems according to some
sequential orderings. IAL is a kind of supervised machine
learning. Such an approach is designed to avoid dimensional
disasters of high dimensional problem. Moreover, it is also
able to cope with high dimensional problems where almost
all of the features are significant and cannot be discarded
by dimensional reduction approaches like feature selection.
Moreover, because features are separately imported into the
system, they are also computed in isolation. Such a process can effectively reduce the interference among different
features. Previous research has validated that IAL can not
only cope with problems with large feature dimension space
[14] but also reduce the interference during the process and
exhibit better performance in the final pattern recognition
results [7, 15].
So far, IAL has been widely employed for pattern recognition based on a number of different predictive machine
learning algorithms. In previous studies, IAL has been shown
as an applicable approach in solving machine learning problems like classification using genetic algorithm (GA) [16, 17],

neural network (NN) [8, 18], support vector machine (SVM)
[19], particle swarm optimization (PSO) [20], decision tree
[21], and so on. These previous studies also showed that IAL
can exhibit better performance than conventional methods
that train all pattern features in one batch.
In this study, incremental neural network training with
an increasing input dimension (ITID) [8] is employed for
EEG eye state classification. ITID is one of IAL neural
network approaches with ordered feature training. It was
developed based on incremental learning in terms of input
attributes (ILIA) [18]. However, different from ILIA which
often trains features with the original feature orderings in
problem dataset, ITID prefers to adjust feature orderings
according to some criteria and trains features according to
the adjusted sequential feature orderings [22].
Previous research has shown that ITID is applicable for
classification. It divides the whole input space into several
subdimensions, each of which corresponds to an input
feature. Instead of learning input features altogether as an
input vector in a training instance, ITID learns input features
one after another through their corresponding subnetworks,
and the structure of NN gradually grows with an increasing
input dimension. During training, information obtained by
a new subnetwork is merged together with the information
obtained by the old network. With less internal interference
among input features, ITID achieves higher generalization
accuracy than conventional methods [8]. Figure 1 shows the
basic neural network structure of ITID.
3.2. Feature Ordering. IAL gradually imports features for
pattern recognition according to some orderings; thus in IAL
classification, it is necessary to decide which feature should
be imported into the predictive system in an earlier phase and
which one can be computed later. Therefore, feature ordering
is a compulsory step in IAL preprocessing. In this unique step,
features with greater discrimination ability are arranged in
the earlier place and those with weak discrimination ability
are imported in later steps. This is similar to feature selection,
a well-known dimensional reduction preprocessing, where
features with greater discrimination ability are selected into
a subset for further computing, while those with weak
discrimination ability are discarded. However, IAL has a
continuously growing feature space; previous research has

Mathematical Problems in Engineering

validated that a proper feature ordering is a key to lower
classification error rates based on IAL [22, 23].
In previous studies, a number of feature ordering estimation methods have been developed for IAL. These methods
can be divided into two types. One is based on each feature‚Äôs
single classification error rates, such as contribution-based
methods [8, 24], while the other ranks features according to
some metrics on feature discrimination ability, like mRMR
[25, 26], entropy [27], Fisher‚Äôs linear discriminant (FLD)
[28], single discriminability (SD) [23], and accumulative discriminability (AD) [9]. Previous experimental results showed
that feature orderings derived by AD often outperform those
derived by other approaches, because AD is a global metric
which aims to ensure that the whole growing feature space
always has the largest discrimination ability during the IAL
feature importing process, while others are local metrics,
which only concentrate on finding the feature with the largest
discrimination ability in each single step.
3.3. AD and Maximum Mean Discriminative Criterion. In
IAL, it is necessary to ensure that datasets always have
the greatest discrimination ability relative to each feature
importing step. Namely, comparing among all the different
feature orderings, the optimum feature ordering should have
the largest value of feature discrimination ability in average.
When a new feature is imported into the predictive system
accordingly, the feature dimension is increased from ùëë to
ùëë + 1. Therefore, the metric of feature discrimination ability
should be the largest all the time, as only in this way it can
guarantee that different classes can be separated in the easiest
way. Therefore, with the aim of optimal classification results,
each intermediate step will identify an optimal feature with
the greatest discrimination ability for each round of feature
importing. Obviously, after all features are imported, the
resulting feature ordering will have the largest sum or mean
of accumulative feature discrimination ability calculated in
each step of the process. Here, as an efficient metric of feature
discrimination ability, AD is employed for the criterion to
obtain the optimum feature ordering. The criterion can be
given with maximum discrimination ability mean by

where ùúáÃÉùëó is the centroid of vector (ùëì1 , ùëì2 , . . . , ùëìùëë ) with
patterns belonging to ùëó.
Therefore, the results of (2) are calculated on the run
when new features are gradually imported into training. To
obtain better classification results, it is necessary to ensure
that the result of (2) is the maximum in every step of
feature importing. Here, std denotes the standard deviation
in multidimensional space, which is derived by the standard
deviation and Euclidean norm.
Let x be the vector for standard deviation calculation; the
standard deviation of x is

and ùëü is the total number of patterns. Obviously, in (3), the
component (ùë•ùëò ‚àí ùúá) is a distance between ùëòth pattern and its
mean. This distance can be written as ‚Äñùê∑ùë•ùëò ,ÃÉùúá ‚Äñ, the Euclidean

and for a tridimensional space, the equation is
std (x)

where ùëì1:ùëë is the feature subset of {ùëì1 , ùëì2 , . . . , ùëìùëö } during the
feature importing process. The mean with a larger value indicates that the corresponding feature ordering has greater discrimination ability than the others. This criterion is called the
maximum mean discriminative criterion (MMDC), which
has the capacity to select the optimum feature ordering for
IAL.
In (1), AD refers to the accumulative discrimination
ability of the dimensional feature space with all imported
features, which is the ratio in ùëë-feature space between the
multidimensional standard deviation of all class centers and
the sum of all multidimensional standard deviations of all

For EEG eye state identification, feature ordering can be
derived based on (1) and MMDC in the first place, and then
time-series data with sorted features are imported into the
predictive systems according to the feature ordering. Moreover, it is necessary to notice that feature ordering should be
obtained only from the training data, so that it is possible
to get rid of the influence from the testing data during the
preprocessing and training, and the classification results will
be closer to the real situation. However, in the validation
and testing stages, all the data should be sorted according to
the feature ordering derived in the preprocessing by training
dataset. Such an operation can ensure that all the features are
trained, validated, and tested in the same ordering; and all the
features are sorted according to their discrimination abilities.
If the feature orderings in the training, validation, and testing
phases are different, features with weak discrimination ability
will be trained in an early stage. However, this will reduce the
accuracy of the classification.

Mathematical Problems in Engineering
time distance are called second-order features. Equation (8)
is the formula for the second-order features:
ùë¶Û∏Ä† (ùë°) = ùêπ [ùë¶ (ùë° + ùê∑) , ùë¶ (ùë°)] ,

(8)

where ùë¶(ùë°) is the first-order feature, ùê∑ is the time distance
length between two instances, and ùêπ is the function with
ùë¶(ùë°+ùê∑) and ùë¶(ùë°). Theoretically, ùêπ can be any calculation rules.
Moreover, some statistical metrics like mean and standard
deviation are often used for feature extraction [33].
In the process of time-series classification, feature extraction and feature ordering should be carried out before
training. However, different from feature ordering which is
derived only by training data, temporal feature extraction is a
process for new feature building; thus it is necessary for it to
be implemented with all datasets. Figure 2 demonstrates the
working flow of a time-series classification system based on
ITID.

5. Experiments
4. Time-Series Classification Approach
Based on IAL
4.1. Time-Series Classification. There are two kinds of different times-series classification approaches: instance-based and
feature-based [29] approaches . The instance-based approach
predicts the classification results for the testing instances
based on the similarity to the training instances. In this
approach, the nearest-neighbor classifiers with Euclidean
distance (NN-Euclidean) [30] or dynamic time warping
(NN-DTW) [31, 32] were widely employed. In another
aspect, the feature-based approach builds temporal features
extracted from the original features and potentially can outperform instance-based classifiers. Feature-based classifiers
commonly consist of two steps: (1) defining the temporal
features and (2) training a classifier based on the temporal
features defined. Due to the fact that IAL employs features
one by one to the predictive system, it has little linkage to the
instance-based approaches. Therefore, when IAL is employed
to solve time-series classification, feature-based approach
is more suitable than instance-based approach and should
be employed by IAL during the time-series classification
process.

4.2. Feature Extraction for Time-Series Classification. Before
the formal time-series classification, it is necessary to preprocess the experimental data in two stages: firstly, feature extraction from original data and, secondly, feature ordering for
IAL. In comparison with some other classification problems,
apart from feature ordering which is a special preprocessing
in IAL, temporal feature extraction from the original data is
another unique step in time-series classification problems.
Temporal feature extraction aims to classify instances
based on the original feature and the state difference in the
time distance. Usually, the original features and those directly
derived from original features are called first-order features,
while features extracted from the state difference in different

5.1. Benchmark. In this study, the EEG eye state corpus from
UCI machine learning repository is employed for the experiments [13]. This EEG eye state dataset was donated by RoÃàsler
and Suendermann from Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative
State University (DHBW), Stuttgart, Germany [12]. All data
were derived from one continuous EEG measurement with
the Emotiv EEG neuroheadset, which is shown in Figure 3.
There are 14980 patterns and 14 features in the dataset,
where the 14 features are the data obtained by 14 sensors
shown in Figure 4. The duration of the measurement was 117
seconds. The eye state was detected via a camera during the
EEG measurement and added later manually to the file after
analyzing the video frames.
In this eye state corpus, there are three instances with
the numbers 899, 10387, and 11510 having obvious errors.
Their values are out of almost 15 k, so they are outliers, which
should be deleted before the experiments. Therefore, only
14977 instances are employed in RoÃàsler‚Äôs experiments. To
compare the results derived from our experiments with those
obtained in the previous studies, those three error instances
are also discarded in our experiments.
For the output of the corpus, ‚Äú1‚Äù indicates the eye-closed
and ‚Äú0‚Äù the eye-open state. There are 6722 legal eye-closed
instances and 8255 legal eye-open instances. All values are in
chronological order with the first measured value at the top
of the data.
Table 1 is the overview of 14977 legal values obtained by
those 14 sensors. It presents the minimum and maximum
values and means and standard deviations of eye-closed and
eye-open states, respectively. According to this table, it is
manifested that although the minimum and maximum values
are quite different in both eye-closed and eye-open states,
the means of these two states of the same feature are almost
the same. Nevertheless, the standard deviations of both states
have a large difference which is obvious in the eye-open state.
Moreover, it can be easily found that the maximum values
of eye-open state of features F7, F3, F4, FC6, T8, P8, and O2
are much higher than the same feature‚Äôs maximum values in

the eye-closed state; and for features AF3, AF4, FC5, F8, T7,
P7, and O1, the minimum values of eye-open state are much
lower than those in eye-closed state. Therefore, both the mean
and standard deviation should be extracted as new features in
the eye state classification process.
5.2. Experiments. During the experiments, all the patterns
were partitioned for training, validation, and testing with
the divisions of 50%, 25%, and 25%, respectively, and
sorted according to the time-series sequence. Six different
approaches for eye state classification were employed in the
experiments. They are designed as shown in Table 2, while
Table 3 presents the final classification results by different
approaches.
(1) IAL with Feature Extraction and Time-Series 1. This is
a time-series approach based on IAL. All the features used
in this approach are second-order features, which are the
averages and standard deviations derived from every 12
instances of original features. These features have been shown
in (9), which were improved from (8),

correspond to a maximum increase while F7, F3, F4, FC6, T8, P8,
and O2 correspond to a minimum decrease when the tester opens
eyes.

The time distance here is 12, where 0 ‚â§ ùê∑ ‚â§ 11, ùê∑ ‚àà ùëÅ. This
time distance is equal to the shortest length of a blink, which
is 100 milliseconds, because the total number of instances
in the eye state corpus is 14980, which was recorded in 117
seconds. As a result of that, there are 14965 instances and
28 features. Before the classification, feature ordering was
derived by AD and MMDC, which has been shown in Table 4.
It is obvious that the standard deviations played a more
important role in the classification, because all the standard
deviations were imported earlier than the averages except the
thirteenth feature which is an average in the first place. Such a
phenomenon coincides with the data shown in Table 1, where
the averages are approximately the same, while the standard
deviations are quite different. In addition, the number of
features in this approach is 28. It needs feature selection;
otherwise the computational cost will be large. Therefore an
IAL approach with feature selection is employed [34]. At last
only two features were used in this time-series classification,
and it obtained a good result in classification error rate, which
is 27.3991%.

(2) IAL with Feature Extraction and Time-Series 2. This is also
an IAL time-series classification approach. With the feature
ordering based on AD and MMDC and feature extraction
based on average and standard deviation, this approach also
follows the model shown in Figure 2. To investigate the
microinfluence brought by time-series, the time duration is
set to be 1; namely, ùê∑ = 1. Equation (8) here is
ùë¶Û∏Ä† (ùë°) = ùë¶ (ùë° + 1) ‚àí ùë¶ (ùë°) .

(10)

Four extracted features were employed in this approach: the
first-order means and the first-order standard deviations of
all the values of each original instance and the second-order
average and second-order standard deviation of all the
values of each instance calculated by (10). Therefore, the
total instance number in this approach is 14976. Based on
the IAL feature ordering metric using AD, these features
were sorted following this order: the first-order means of
instances, the first-order standard deviations of instances,
the second-order standard deviation, and the second-order
average. This feature ordering has been shown in Table 4.
The error rate obtained in the final classification result is
27.4573%.
(3) IAL with Feature Extraction. This approach is IAL
classification without time-series. In comparison with the
first and second approaches, this experiment is designed to

show the effect of time-series factors, namely, ùë¶Û∏Ä† (ùë°) in (8),
which is employed in the previous experiments but will not
be used in this experiment. Thus there are no time-series
factors considered in this approach. As a result, there
are no second-order features. Consequently, there are no
second-order average and second-order standard deviation.
Therefore, this experiment only retains the first-order feature
extraction process. During the experiment, IAL with feature
extraction is employed merely based on the first-order
average and first-order standard deviation, but without
considering time-series factors. In this way, all the original
features are trained according to the original ordering with
newly built average and standard deviation of each instance
following behind. This has been shown in Table 4. The final
classification error rate is 27.4793%, which is slightly worse
than the first approach.
(4) Pure IAL Approach. This approach only employs IAL with
feature ordering derived by AD and MMDC. There is no new
feature extracted from the original data. Moreover, no timeseries impact factors are used in this approach. Such a design
aims to find out the influence brought by time-series and firstand second-order feature extraction. The feature ordering is
shown in Table 4. The classification error rate is 27.4693%,
which approximates to the results obtained in the first and
second approaches.

(5) Time-Series Classification with Batch-Training. This
method has the same consideration of time-series, which
is similar to the second approach, except that all features
are trained using the conventional batch-training method.
The time duration is the same as that in approach 2, where
ùê∑ = 1. Therefore, the total instance number in this approach
is 14976. All the features are extracted according to (10) and
trained in one batch. As such, there is no average or standard
deviation extracted from the extract vector derived by (10).
The objective of this experiment is to check the effect of IAL
and second-order feature extraction compared using the first
and second approaches. The error rate in the final time-series
classification is 29.5046%, which is much higher than in the
previous IAL approaches.
(6) Conventional Batch-Training Method. The last approach
is the conventional method based on back propagation
neural networks without considering time-series, whereby
all the original features are directly trained in one batch.
This approach obtains the highest error rate among all four
experiments. The error rate is about 30.6328% in the final
classification result.
5.3. Result Analysis. According to the experimental results
of these six different approaches shown and compared in
Table 3, the first approach obtains the lowest classification error rate and the conventional batch-training method
exhibits the worst and highest classification error rate of
30.63%. In comparison with RoÃàsler‚Äôs experimental results
using multilayer perceptron, where the error rate is more than
30% [12], the results derived by IAL approaches are much
better. All of these classification error rates are lower than
30%. This merely indicates that, firstly, IAL approach can
outperform conventional batch-training methods; secondly,
feature extraction with time-series properties is very useful
in the improvement of the classification results for time-series

problems; thirdly, feature ordering is very important to IAL.
Moreover, feature orderings derived by AD and MMDC can
outperform the original feature ordering in IAL.

6. Conclusions
In this paper, a time-series classification approach based
on IAL is proposed for EEG eye state identification. The
approach is novel in a way that it firstly extracts features from
the raw data and then sorts these features using IAL feature
ordering approach according to feature‚Äôs discrimination ability. During the training process, the newly extracted features
are imported into the neural predictive system in a sequential
order based on the feature ordering. In comparison with the
conventional batch-training methods and feature extraction
method without considering the relation between time-series
data, the experimental results of time-series IAL showed that
such a machine learning approach can not only cope with
time-series classification problems but also improve the accuracy of the classification results. Moreover, the experimental
results also imply that the relation among time-series data is
crucial to the data analysis in such classification problems.
In future, some issues remain as open topics for further research. For instance, besides the mean and standard
deviation, whether there exist any other time-series related
features for time-series classification is still an open problem.
Secondly, the approach to extract new second-order features
from raw data is also significant. Thirdly, the correlations
between second-order features and first-order features often
vary. Hence, the influence existing in the time-series classification process is still unknown. Last but not the least, whether
there exists an optimal method for both first- and secondorder feature ordering in IAL training is also a challenging
problem for time-series classification.
In general, the feasibility of IAL-based time-series classification approach proposed in this paper has been validated

8
by EEG eye state identification experiments. The final results
indicated that IAL is applicable for EEG time-series classification. However, there are still a number of work items
remaining for the future studies.
