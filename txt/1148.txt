Improved nature provision in urban environments offers great potential for achieving both
biodiversity conservation and public health objectives. Yet there are few experimental
studies that address links between specific natural environments and physiological
and/or psychological changes that could contribute to the health and wellbeing cobenefits of urban nature. In addition, relative to green space, the salutogenic impact of
aquatic environments are understudied. Here, we present a feasibility study examining
the use of low-cost wearable technology to quantify the psychophysiological effects
of short-term exposure to urban wetlands. The study took place at the WWT London
Wetland Centre, which is characterized by its contrasting biodiverse wetland habitat and
surrounding urban setting. Thirty-six healthy participants experienced counterbalanced
exposures to an indoor space, a wetland, an urban site. We continuously recorded
electroencephalographic (EEG) data and real-time physiological stress responses;
with additional monitoring of post-exposure self-reported mood states. We found a
significant effect of site on mean resting heart rate (HR), with increased HR in the
urban setting, although this was only observed in participants with pre-existing high
stress. We found no significant differences in other measures of physiological stress
responses (heart rate variability and electrodermal activity). The EEG data showed
modulation of high beta band activity only in the wetland setting, potentially related
to changes in attention. However, the EEG findings were confounded by low quality
signals and artifacts caused by movement and environmental interference. Assessments
of self-reported mood states demonstrated an increase in positive feelings in the
wetland setting. A pronounced decrease in negative feelings in the wetland setting
was observed in stressed individuals only. Our results suggest that pre-existing stress
levels may be an important modulator of the salutogenic effect of blue-green space. We
provide partial support for the hypothesis that exposure to blue-green space promotes
stress recovery and for the use of low-cost psychophysiological measurements to

quantify the potential stress-reducing effects of blue–green space exposure in urban
dwellers. Further technological refinement is required for this approach to become a
viable tool to support evidence-based decision-making for public health and green/blue
space provision.

features, freshwater blue spaces, such as lakes, ponds, rivers,
streams and other wetlands, are largely understudied (White
et al., 2010; Foley and Kistemann, 2015), particularly in urban
areas. Despite insufficient research and substantial heterogeneity
across studies, systematic reviews of the literature point to an
overall positive association between exposure to blue space and
improved mental health, wellbeing and the promotion of physical
activity has been identified (Gascon et al., 2015, 2017). Research
in Germany and Hong Kong supports the delivery of salutogenic
effects by blue space provision in large cities (Völker et al., 2018;
Garrett et al., 2019). In the United Kingdom, a region-wide,
cross-sectional survey suggests visits to freshwater blue space
promotes social interaction and conveys psychological benefits
(de Bell et al., 2017). Recently announced research programs in
Europe will further aim to map and quantify the impacts of urban
blue infrastructure (Grellier et al., 2017). A few experimental
studies have attempted to isolate the effects of blue space as
compared to green space by exposing participants to photographs
as a proxy for natural environments. These findings do suggest
that blue space has enhanced capacity to promote psychological
restoration relative to green space (e.g., White et al., 2010;
Seresinhe et al., 2015; Grassini et al., 2019).
Historically, some sectors of the nature conservation
movement have promoted approaches to preserving natural
environments by excluding people from them or restricting
access through the establishment of protected areas (Brockington
and Igoe, 2006). This conservation method stands in stark
contrast to the more recent narrative that favors (re)connecting
people with high quality and/or extensive natural environments
to foster resilience in both ecosystems and human communities
(e.g., Wood et al., 2017). Research in the health sciences
and increasingly from conservation biology, environmental
psychology, environmental education and sustainability science
further supports the beneficial effects of (re)connecting people
with nature to enhance human HWB and promote the uptake of
pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors (Ives et al., 2018; Rosa
et al., 2018). Despite a growing interest in understanding how
exposure to natural environments might be leveraged to achieve
the goals of both conservation and public health (Bottrill et al.,
2014; Milner-Gulland et al., 2014; Lovell et al., 2015), progress
in this field has been limited by the complexities of human–
environment interactions and a lack of understanding of the
mechanisms that support the delivery of benefits (Hartig et al.,
2014; Shanahan et al., 2015; Dadvand et al., 2016). Retrospective
and observational studies dominate the literature and few
studies have focused specifically on inland aquatic environments.
Laboratory-based, but in particular ‘natural’ experimental studies
have been proposed as an important step toward developing

INTRODUCTION
It is estimated that by 2050 two-thirds of the global human
population will live in urban centers (United Nations
Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2014). Future
urban environments are predicted to face significant challenges
associated with increased air and water pollution, altered water
regimes, diminished water quality, greater extremes of flood
and drought (Taylor et al., 2004; Miller and Hutchins, 2017)
and urban heat island effects (Levermore et al., 2018). Therefore
the trend toward urbanization, especially in the context of
climate change, poses significant challenges to the many activities
that influence people’s health and wellbeing (HWB), including
urban planning, infrastructure development, employment, food
security and healthcare. Widespread adoption of blue-green
infrastructure (BGI) within growing and emerging urban
environments has the potential to secure and create ecosystem
services that counter these adverse biophysical impacts of
urbanization (Voskamp and Van de Ven, 2015). BGI may also
provide socio-cultural and public health co-benefits through
their association with increased social inclusion, interaction, and
cohesion (e.g., Cohen et al., 2008; Francis et al., 2012; Hartig
et al., 2014; Jennings et al., 2016; Jennings and Bamkole, 2019),
improved public safety (e.g., Branas et al., 2011) and enhanced
quality of life (e.g., Thompson et al., 2014; Aspinall et al., 2015;
McCracken et al., 2016; Mensah et al., 2016).
In recent years, numerous studies have reported on the role
of exposure to natural environments in both disease prevention
and salutogenesis, the latter referring to the promotion of HWB
rather than simply the absence of disease (for a recent review,
see Kondo et al., 2018a). The literature suggests several possible
pathways by which exposure to natural environments may deliver
HWB benefits (Hartig et al., 2014; Kuo, 2015). Two prominent
and complementary frameworks are the Stress Recovery Theory
(SRT; Ulrich, 1983) and the Attention Restoration Theory (ART;
Kaplan, 1995), both of which posit that natural environments
have restorative potential, because they moderate physiological
arousal or reduce mental fatigue (Berto, 2014). It is hypothesized
that this reduction in psychological and physiological stress
promotes HWB benefits.
Different types and qualities of natural environments
influence HWB in different ways and extents (Hartig et al.,
2014; South et al., 2015; Wheeler et al., 2015). Research
into aquatic environments or ‘blues spaces,’ defined broadly
as any environment predominantly comprising a natural or
human-modified water feature, has primarily focused on coastal
environments (e.g., Miller et al., 2012; Wheeler et al., 2012;
White et al., 2013). Despite being prominent environmental

a deeper understanding of how natural environments might
be leveraged to deliver multiple co-benefits (Frumkin et al.,
2017; Gascon et al., 2017). To this end, innovative methods are
required to accurately capture physiological and psychological
responses in situ, as the experience unfolds (Frumkin et al.,
2017). In recent years, we have seen a significant rise in the
popularity and quality of a wide range of commercially available
wearable technologies that allow for continuous monitoring of
physiological signals (Bunn et al., 2018). As they are minimally
obtrusive and offer opportunity to observe individuals in
‘naturalistic’ outdoor experiments, these devices are increasingly
used in research applications. A small number of studies have
used mobile devices to monitor responses to urban versus
natural environments (Kondo et al., 2018b but see: Aspinall et al.,
2015; Neale et al., 2017; Tilley et al., 2017; Olszewska-Guizzo
et al., 2018) but – to our knowledge – none have specifically
focused on blue space.
In this study we take advantage of the unique setting of
the WWT London Wetland Centre, a 42 hectare constructed
urban wetland in West London, created and managed by
the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust (WWT)1 to experimentally
test, for the first time, the salutogenic potential of urban
wetlands. As a wetland conservation charity, WWT seeks to
provide co-benefits to biodiversity and to the broader public
through recreation and education activities at its wetland
conservation sites. WWT London Wetland Centre visitor
feedback frequently describes the site as an ‘oasis’ within the
metropolis of London (Figure 1). To explore this further,
WWT engaged in a collaboration with Imperial College
London to investigate and develop metrics for monitoring and
evaluating the potential HWB benefits delivered to visitors.
Specifically, we aimed to critically evaluate the feasibility
of low-cost wearable technology to complement subjective
measures of HWB. We report on a pilot study implementing a
commercially available EEG system and photoplethysmography
(PPG) device to detect differences in brain activity and
physiological stress as a short-term wetland visitor experience
unfolded. This represents an important advance upon previous
research in this field, which is typically limited to broadscale epidemiological or laboratory-based experiments using
only proxies for real blue space exposure. The findings are
intended to inform the design, monitoring, evaluation and
improvement of WWT activities aimed at delivering HWB
benefits to communities and visitors, and, more generally,
to support evidence-based policy-making in urban planning
(Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust [WWT], 2017).

never visited the wetland center before. Of the participants
who gave responses, 83% (n = 29) were not WWT members
or affiliates, while 68% percent (n = 25) were not members
of other conservation charities. Overall, the majority of our
sample was unfamiliar with wetland conservation prior to
participating in the study. All participants were screened against
exclusion criteria, i.e., the presence of neurological conditions or
injuries, psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disease, taking of
prescription or over-the-counter medicines, and any departure
from normal or corrected-to-normal eyesight or hearing. This
resulted in exclusion of n = 2 participants. Written prior and
informed consent was obtained from each participant.

Study Site
The study took place in and around the WWT London Wetland
Centre located in Barnes, West London, which was created
through the conversion of four disused Victorian reservoirs
into a range of biodiverse wetland habitats. The WWT London
Wetland Centre consists of a visitor center (including a café
and education center), an area of living collection of wetland
birds and mammals, and surrounding managed wetland habitats.
The latter carries the Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)
designation due to its national importance for UK breeding
birds in lowland open waters and for its assemblages of nonbreeding gadwall (Anas strepera) and shoveler (Anas clypeata).
This site was selected for this experiment because of its unique
location (Figure 1) that enables a quick transition between
exposure to a species-rich SSSI wetland and a typical urban
setting. The sites were selected with the intention of achieving
maximal contrast between the urban and wetland environment
in order to maximize the potential of detecting differences
in psychophysiological and subjective responses from short
exposures. Limitations around experimental practicalities were
also taken into account i.e., the need to reduce distance walked
and time in the experiment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
We recruited 36 participants for this study, the majority of
which were contacted through a social corporate responsibility
scheme which allows local professionals to volunteer for WWT
during normal work hours. Just over half (53%, n = 34) had

0◦ 140 21.300 W) was chosen because it was the first suitable urban
bench outside the Centre. Suitability was judged by the number of
features present at this site that are typical of busy urban settings
e.g., a traffic intersection, traffic lights, a pedestrian crossing,
passers-by, shops, and cafes.

Control Site
A multipurpose function room at WWT London Wetland Centre
(51◦ 280 37.900 N 0◦ 140 09.200 W) was used as a control setting for
baseline measures of PPG and EEG (Figure 2A). The room
contents consisted of chairs, tables, a TV and modest décor. Its
use as a function/class room enabled us to isolate participants
from center visitors and external noise, thus creating a relatively
low stimuli environment. It is favorably located between the
wetland and urban sites.

Procedure
The study was conducted between the 14th July and 23rd
August 2017. Prevailing weather conditions were recorded for
each participant session (cloud cover, air temperature, wind
speed humidity using UK Met Office data2 ). The level of
other potentially confounding variables (e.g., air traffic) was
also recorded. Over the 6 week testing period no sessions
were canceled due to adverse weather. Participants attended
their allocated session individually, with scheduled start times
at 9am, 12pm, or 2pm. Upon arrival participants were
greeted by a researcher and shown to the visitor center. We
first conducted brief, semi-structured interviews to explore
participants’ motivations to take part, expectations about the
experiment, anticipated benefits, pre-existing knowledge of
the site, any formal or informal affiliation to WWT (e.g.,
member, donor, volunteer), support for other conservation
charities, and their understanding of the aims and procedures.
Participants were also asked how they felt in the moment,
and whether that was a departure from their regular mental
and/or physical state. Following the interview, participants were
asked to complete a set of questionnaires to obtain demographic
information (age, gender, employment status), and an assessment
of relevant psychological variables including life stress, recent
levels of depression, anxiety and stress, and participants’ sense
of connectedness with nature to provide an assessment of
participants recent exposure and response to stressors. The
in-depth interview data were intended to provide qualitative
contextual information, but a report on this is beyond the scope
of the current study.
The experimental setup consisted of a wristband measuring
real-time physiological data and a mobile EEG device [for details,
see Depression, Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21)]. Fitting the
measurement equipment took approximately 15 min. Following
calibration, EEG and physiological data were continuously
recorded for the full duration of the experiment. Participants
remained seated in the indoor control room for 10 min to
obtain stable baseline readings (Figure 2A). For the outdoor
sections of the experiment, participants carried a light rucksack
with the EEG data acquisition laptop. A researcher accompanied
the participant to each site. Walking distances between the
control and the urban and wetland setting were 390 and 430 m,
respectively (Figures 2B,C), the terrain was flat. Participants were
then asked to sit for 10 min on a permanent bench at each site,
with the researcher retiring out of sight for all exposure periods.
For all three exposures, and for the full 10 min, participants were
instructed to relax, remove the backpack, remain seated and to
take in their surroundings, but not to close their eyes. At the
end of the 10 min exposure, participants were asked to complete
a self-report survey assessing mood states. After completing the

Wetland Site
The control site is situated in the visitor center area
(51◦ 280 47.200 N 0◦ 140 08.500 W), which includes the café, shop
and education center of the WWT London Wetland Centre site.
Adjacent is a captive animal area and beyond the captive area
is ‘Wildside’: a managed ‘natural’ wetland area (Figure 2B). We
were cognizant of the need to keep distance walked to minimum
because of headset discomfort and experimental fatigue and also
because our interest was in seated/resting responses to urban
and natural wetland environments. For the latter reason, both
the wetland and urban sites were chosen because they featured
permanent benches and represented ‘real-world’ resting spots.
The wetland site was chosen because it was the first bench within
‘Wildside’ with a blue/green vista overlooking water.

Urban Site
The study area (WWT London Wetland Centre) was chosen
to create maximally opposing sensory experiences and to
test differential responses to these environments. With similar
consideration to the wetland site, the urban site (51◦ 280 31.300 N

baseline, urban and wetland site exposures, a short debriefing
session followed. We were specifically interested in whether
participants showed a stated preference for the urban or the
wetland site and whether they had experienced any physical (e.g.,
from wearing the equipment) or psychological discomfort or
distress that might confound the outcome measures.
The study had a repeated measures design, with three
exposure conditions/sites: indoor (control), urban and
wetland. Condition order of the urban and wetland sites
was counterbalanced between participants; the control condition
was always administered first.

Outcome Assessments
Real-Time Physiological Stress Measures
Cardiovascular and electrodermal activity metrics are commonly
used to assess and monitor the relative activity of the sympathetic
and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system,
which are respectively associated with states of threat (fight
or flight response) and calm (rest and digest). These metrics
can therefore be interpreted as indicators of physiological and
psychological stress (Camm et al., 1996; Jacobs et al., 2012;
Kondo et al., 2018b). We used an Empatica E4 wristband
(Garbarino et al., 2014) to obtain continuous physiological
responses from the participants. The wristband includes a
photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor to measure blood volume
pulse (BVP) which is used to derive heart rate (HR) and heart rate
variability (HRV), and an electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor
to measure changes in skin conductance. The wristband was
attached to the non-dominant hand of the participant, with PPG
and EDA data recorded at 64 and 4 Hz respectively.

Baseline Assessments
The Holmes and Rahe Stress Inventory
The Holmes & Rahe Stress Inventory, also known as the Social
Readjustment Rating Scale (Holmes and Rahe, 1967) comprises
a checklist of significant life events. Respondents are asked to
indicate the number of events they have experienced in the last
year. Frequencies of occurrence are multiplied by the event’s ‘Life
Change Units’ as an indicator of severity. The total summed
scores is indicative of overall stress and associated with the risk
of developing stress-related health problems.

Heart rate
Heart rate increases as a result of both physical exertion and
psychological stress. Evidence suggests that HR responds to acute
environmental stimuli (Kjellgren and Buhrkall, 2010; Park et al.,
2010; Song et al., 2013). From the continuous HR recording,
we calculated the mean HR in each setting (control, wetland
and urban), expressed in beats per minute (bpm). The analysis
window was restricted to the central 8 min of the exposure period.
Standard HR recovery testing measures HR from peak exercise
to 2 min post-exercise (Cole et al., 1999; Shetler et al., 2001).
For moderate exercise (walking), we eliminated the first and
last minute to minimize the impact of cardiovascular recovery
from the walk to the site, and the effects of increased movement
observed in participants toward the end of the exposure period.

Depression, Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21)
We used the 21-item version of the Depression, Anxiety
and Stress Scale (DASS-21; Henry and Crawford, 2005) to
measure reported signs of depression (expressed as dysphoria,
hopelessness, devaluation of life, self-deprecation, lack of
interest/involvement, anhedonia, or inertia), anxiety (expressed
as autonomic arousal, muscle tension, situational anxiety, and
subjective experience of anxious affect) and stress (expressed as
difficulty relaxing, nervous arousal, and being easily agitated,
irritable, over-reactive and impatient). Respondents are asked to
rate each of the 21 items (e.g., “I found it hard to wind down”)
on a 4-point Likert scale, indicating the extent to which they have
experienced that state over the past week. Scores for depression,
anxiety and stress are calculated by summing the scores for the
relevant items. The DASS-21 has high internal consistency and
yields meaningful discriminations in a variety of settings. We
used the UK normative data published by Henry and Crawford
(2005) to categorize participants as having either above or below
average stress levels.

Heart rate variability
A healthy heart is not a metronome (Shaffer et al., 2014) and
HRV represents the fluctuation in the time intervals between
adjacent heartbeats. Typically, higher HRV values are associated
with improved physiological health and self-regulatory capacity
or resilience (Carney et al., 2005; Thayer et al., 2010). HRV
may also be associated with psychological processes linked
to prefrontal brain function, such as attention and emotion
(McCraty and Shaffer, 2015). We used Kubios HRV Standard
3.1.0 (Tarvainen et al., 2008) to process the PPG data and derive
HRV parameters, applying threshold-based correction to remove
artifacts and ectopic beats by comparing inter-beat interval values
(the time period between successive heartbeats; IBI) against a
local average interval. We then used an advanced de-trending
method based on smoothness priors regularization (Tarvainen
et al., 2002). Applying a time-varying high-pass filter the data are
smoothed to remove IBI time series non-stationarities. Samples
with artifact correction >15% were discarded to minimize the
impact of artifacts on analysis results (Tarvainen et al., 2008).
Consequently, only 12 participants with good quality data for
all three conditions were retained (Supplementary Table 1).
Following the convention for short-term recording (Camm et al.,
1996), we selected 5 consecutive minutes of signal 3 min into each

The Nature Relatedness Scale
The Nature Relatedness Scale (Nisbet et al., 2009) is a
21-item instrument used in research on sustainability and
wellbeing, serving as a measure of individual differences in
connectedness with nature. Comprising of three scales, the
NR-self (8 items), the NR-perspective (7 items) and the NRexperience (6 items), it provides a measure of the respondent’s
internalized identification with nature (i.e., feelings of personal
connectedness and meaning), their external nature-related world
view (i.e., a sense of agency concerning our impact on the
environment) and their physical familiarity with the natural
world (i.e., a desire to interact and actively engage with the natural
world). High scores are associated with increased concern for
the environment.

10–20 position system (see above). The continuous EEG signal
was filtered with high and low band-pass frequencies of 0.16
and 42 hz, and then re-referenced to the average reference in
EEGLAB. Using event markers the signal was segmented into
control, urban and wetland epochs with extreme artifacts and
poor data regions rejected through visual inspection and ICA.
A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied, normalized by the
number of data points of the processed recording, to extract
component frequencies for all 14 sensor location on the headset.
Given that the Emotiv has only 14 channels and the data sample
rate is only 128 Hz, we calculated a global average for each
frequency band (e.g., see: McMahan et al., 2015). Root mean
square (RMS) values were obtained for each segment of data
corresponding to the exposure conditions/sites (control, wetland
and urban). Using an in-house MATLAB script, we extracted
RMS for delta (0.5–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (9–13 Hz),
low beta (13–19 Hz), high beta (21–27 Hz), frequencies, each
associated with different mental states and levels of consciousness
(Table 1). For the analysis of the EEG data, we therefore obtained
one mean value per frequency band for each individual and
each site. To standardize the data before statistical analysis, we
employed a min-max scaling procedure. Following inspection of
the boxplot for the different EEG frequency bands, we eliminated
30 data points as outliers (Supplementary Figure 1).

measurement period, thereby selecting a central portion for each
period. This selection process was repeated for each participant
and each condition.
Typically, HRV is analyzed as a time-domain and/or
frequency-domain signal. The former quantifies the variability in
measurements of the IBI. Computationally more straightforward,
it is more consistently applied in the existing literature (Michael
et al., 2017) compared with the frequency-domain measurements
that estimate the distribution of absolute or relative power into
various frequency bands.
We applied the following time-domain metrics suitable for
characterization of HRV based on short (i.e., 5 min) epochs:
the root mean square of successive differences of the inter-beat
intervals (RMSSD), the number of adjacent NN intervals that
differ from each other by more than 50 ms (NN50) and the
Triangular Interpolation of the NN Interval Histogram (TINN).
Note that NN intervals refer to the intervals between ‘normal’
peaks, i.e., excluding abnormal beats due to measurement
artifacts. For the frequency-domain, we employed the most
common method to calculate HRV spectra, i.e., a Fourier
transform, to derive the primary components: the low frequency
(LF, 0.04–0.15 Hz) and high frequency (HF, 0.15–0.40 Hz)
spectra. For further analysis, we opted to transform the data
using the natural logarithm to yield an approximately normal
distribution (Michael et al., 2017).

Self-Reported Mood States
Electrodermal activity

To capture mood state changes following exposure to the
different environments, participants were asked to complete the
Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson et al.,
1988) following each 10 min exposure session. The PANAS
consists of two 10-item scales measuring positive and negative
mood states. Items are rated on a 5-point scale from “not at
all” to “very much.” Summed scale scores reflect independent
dispositional dimensions. A high score on the negative affect scale
indicates subjective distress and un-pleasurable engagement,
and a low score indicating the absence of these feelings. High
scores on the positive scale are associated with enthusiasm
and alertness, indicating a pleasurable engagement with the
environment whereas low scores are associated with lethargy
and sadness. The PANAS has been shown to produce a reliable

The Empatica E4 sampled EDA at 4 Hz, and skin conductance
(SC) was measured in micro-Siemens (µS). Due to variation in
the length of EDA readings across participants, analysis windows
were standardized by removing the first minute of data. The
subsequent 8 min were used in the analysis.
Continuous Decomposition Analysis (CDA) was performed
on EDA data in Ledalab (Benedek and Kaernbach, 2010) to
decompose SC data into tonic (skin conductance level; SCL) and
phasic (skin conductance response; SCR) components (Dawson
et al., 2007). Event markers were imported from Empatica E4
wristbands to determine the central 8 min SC analysis window
for each exposure session. For the purposes of this study, two
measures representing tonic and phasic activity were used; the
mean tonic activity within a treatment window, and the number
of significant SCR events, respectively.

Electro-Encephalography (EEG)
We used an Emotiv EPOC+ EEG system to obtain brain
electrical activity measurement non-invasively through the scalp.
The EPOC+ has 14 channels in the international 10–20 position
system (AF3, AF4, F3, F4, F7, F8, FC5, FC6, T7, T8, P7,

prevent electrode dehydration we added 5% glycerol to the saline

for contact quality, signals were sampled at 128 Hz per channel
and sent via Bluetooth to a portable laptop computer. EEG

and the 60–69th percentile for Stress (Henry and Crawford,
2005). Participants also reported high levels of nature relatedness,
with average scores similar to those who report ‘seeing themselves

non-clinical British sample (Henry and Crawford, 2005).

Statistical Analyses
We report descriptive statistics for the sample’s demographic
characteristics and baseline assessments of stress levels and
nature-relatedness. To explore the influence of demographic
differences on baseline indicators of stress and naturerelatedness, we conducted t-tests (assessing gender differences)
and examined Pearson correlations (assessing associations with
age). We created separate general linear models for each of the
continuous outcome measures, with Site (control, urban and
wetland) as the within-subjects factor, while controlling for
Site Order, which was entered as a between-subjects factor. To
account for individual differences that could impact physiological
responses, we also controlled for current (self-reported) levels
of stress. For this purpose, we classified participants into ‘selfreported low stress’ and ‘self-reported high-stress’ groups on
the basis of their DASS-21 stress score relative to published
UK population mean scores (Henry and Crawford, 2005), and
included this as a between-subjects factor. For the EEG analysis,
we included frequency band (alpha, high-beta, low-beta, theta,
and delta) as an additional within-subjects factor.

Exposure Effects on
Psychophysiological Measures
Heart Rate
There was a significant effect of Site on mean HR, F(2,56) = 3.703,
p = 0.031, η2 = 0.117, and a significant interaction between Site
and Stress Level, F(2,56) = 4.848, p = 0.011, η2 = 0.148, but no
interaction effect between Site and Site Order, F(2,56) = 0.261,
p = 0.771, η2 = 0.009. Neither the main effect of Site Order, nor
Stress Level was significant, F(1,28) = 0.846, p = 0.366, η2 = 0.029
and F(1,28) = 0.215, p = 0.647, η2 = 0.008, respectively.
To clarify the interaction effect, we conducted a simple effects
analysis, which demonstrated no significant differences between
sites for ‘self-reported low stress’ individuals, F(2,27) = 0.399,
p = 0.675, η2 = 0.029, but a significant effect of Site in ‘selfreported high stress’ individuals, F(2,27) = 6.045, p = 0.007,
η2 = 0.309. Pairwise comparisons indicated increased HR in
the urban setting compared with both the wetland (p = 0.030)
and the control setting (p = 0.005; corrected for multiple
comparisons) (Figure 3).

RESULTS
Demographic Data and Baseline
Assessments
Participants were on average 41 years of age (SD = 10.28).
Women were slightly over-represented in the sample (61.8%)
compared with men (38.2%). Descriptive statistics for the
baseline assessments are summarized in Table 2. On average,
participants’ life stress scores were relatively elevated, which
is associated with increased risk of developing stress-related
health conditions. A minority (15.2%) of the sample fell into
the ‘low risk’ category (scores < 150), while almost half (48.5%)
of the sample was classified as being at moderate risk (scores
150–300), and a significant proportion (36.4%) were at high
risk (scores > 300).
The DASS-21 is indicative of self-reported stress, anxiety and
depression in the last week. In relation to relevant UK-based

We found no significant differences between the exposure

no significant main effect of Site on RMSSD, F(2,22) = 0.711,

Similarly, the main effect of Site on NN50 was not significant,
F(2,22) = 0.775, p = 0.481, η2 = 0.064. There was no significant
main effect of either Site Order, F(1,11) = 0.576, p = 0.464,

η2 = 0.050, or Stress Level, F(1,11) = 1.317, p = 0.275, η2 = 0.107.
None of the interaction effects were significant, for Site and Site

The main effect of Site on TINN was not significant,
F(2,22) = 0.991, p = 0.387, η2 = 0.083. There was no significant
main effect of either Site Order, F(1,11) = 0.551, p = 0.474,
η2 = 0.048, or Stress Level, F(1,11) = 0.603, p = 0.454, η2 = 0.052.
None of the interaction effects were significant, for Site and Site

Level, F(2,22) = 0.459, p = 0.638, η2 = 0.040.
With respect to the frequency-domain, we did not find a
significant main effect of Site on the Low Frequency signal,
F(2,22) = 0.156, p = 0.857, η2 = 0.014, nor the High Frequency
signal, F(2,22) = 2.614, p = 0.096, η2 = 0.192. Site Order
seemed to have a marginally significant effect on the Low
Frequency signal, F(1,11) = 4.206, p = 0.065, η2 = 0.277, but
not on the High Frequency signal, F(1,11) = 0.216, p = 0.651,
η2 = 0.019. No significant effects were observed of Stress
Level on the Low Frequency or the High Frequency signal,
F(1,11) = 0.529, p = 0.482, η2 = 0.046 and F(1,11) = 0.656,
p = 0.435, η2 = 0.056, respectively. The interaction effect between
Site and Site Order was not significant for the low Frequency
signal, F(2,22) = 0.291, p = 0.750, η2 = 0.026, nor for the High
Frequency signal, F(2,22) = 0.255, p = 0.777, η2 = 0.023. Finally,
no significant interaction was observed between Site and Stress

η2 = 0.034, nor for the High Frequency signal, F(2,22) = 2.610,
p = 0.096, η2 = 0.192.

p = 0.529, η2 = 0.056, and there were no systematic differences
between the Frequency Bands, F(2.28,25.02) = 0.418, p = 0.795,
η2 = 0.037. Site Order also did not affect the EEG signal,

Level, F(1,11) = 1.667, p = 0.223, η2 = 0.132. However, of key
interest is the interaction effect between Site and Frequency Band,
which indicates differential environmental effects depending
on the EEG band, F(8,88) = 2.195, p = 0.035, η2 = 0.166.
Simple effects analysis showed that EEG responses varied by
site only in the High Beta band, F(2,10) = 6.320, p = 0.017,
η2 = 0.558. Significantly stronger signals were observed in the
wetland versus the urban setting (p = 0.015), whereas they only
marginally differed from the control setting (p = 0.076), and
the urban and control setting also did not differ (p = 0.654)
(Figure 4). None of the other frequency bands showed any
differences in EEG signal [low-beta, F(2,10) = 2.482, p = 0.133,
η2 = 0.332, alpha, F(2,10) = 0.691, p = 0.524, η2 = 0.121, Theta,

None of the other two-way interactions were significant: Site
by Site Order, F(2,22) = 2.729, p = 0.087, η2 = 0.199, Site by Stress
Level, F(2,22) = 0.30, p = 0.971, η2 = 0.00, Frequency Band by
Order, F(2.28,25.02) = 0.253, p = 0.805, η2 = 0.023, and Frequency
Band by Stress Level, F(2.28,25.02) = 1.309, p = 0.291, η2 = 0.106.
The three way interaction between Site, Frequency Band and

and neither was the interaction between Site, Frequency Band
and Stress Level, F(8,88) = 0.533, p = 0.829, η2 = 0.046.

Electrodermal Activity

For the positive subscale of the PANAS, we found a significant
main effect of Site, F(2,58) = 3.698, p = 0.031, η2 = 0.113,
demonstrating the strongest positive feelings were reported in
the wetland setting (M = 32.86, SD = 11.55), followed by the
control (M = 30.29, SD = 10.03), and then the urban (M = 28.18,
SD = 10.92). There was no significant main effect of either Site
Order, F(1,29) = 0.186, p = 0.669, η2 = 0.006, or Stress Level,
F(1,29) = 2.434, p = 0.130, η2 = 0.077. None of the interaction
effects were significant, for Site and Site Order, F(2,58) = 1.588,
p = 0.213, η2 = 0.052; for Site and Stress Level, F(2,58) = 0.083,
p = 0.921, η2 = 0.003.
For the negative subscale of the PANAS, we found a significant
main effect of Site, F(2,58) = 8.671, p = 0.001, η2 = 0.230. There
was no significant main effect of Site Order, F(1,29) = 0.209,
p = 0.651, η2 = 0.007, but the main effect of Stress Level was
significant, F(1,29) = 5.352, p = 0.028, η2 = 0.156. Because
we also found an interaction effect between Site and Stress
Level, F(2,58) = 0.083, p = 0.921, η2 = 0.003, we conducted
a simple effects analysis, which demonstrated that for the
subgroup classified as ‘self-reported low stress,’ PANAS negative
scores did not differ between sites, F(2,28) = 1.188, p = 0.320,
η2 = 0.078, but those classified as more stressed reported
significant differences, F(2,28) = 8.585, p = 0.001, η2 = 0.380.
Pairwise comparisons demonstrated significantly fewer negative
feelings in the wetland setting compared with both the control
(p = 0.006) and the urban setting (p = 0.002; both corrected for
multiple comparisons) (Figure 5).

Self-Reported Mood States

We found no significant effects on the phasic EDA activity (the
number of significant skin conductance responses, nSCR), nor on
the measure of tonic EDA activity.
The main effect of Site on nSCR was not significant,
F(2,58) = 0.414, p = 0.663, η2 = 0.014. There was no significant
main effect of either Site Order, F(1,29) = 0.638, p = 0.431,
η2 = 0.022, or Stress Level, F(1,29) = 0.821, p = 0.372, η2 = 0.028.
The interaction effects were not significant, for Site and Site
Order, F(2,58) = 1.068, p = 0.350, η2 = 0.036; or for Site and Stress
Level, F(2,58) = 0.657, p = 0.522, η2 = 0.022.
For the within-subjects effects on tonic EDA, we report
Greenhouse–Geisser correct results, as Mauchley’s test of
sphericity was significant [W = 0.382, 2(2) = 26.96, p < 0.001].
There was no significant main effect of Site, F(1.24,35.84) = 0.119,
p = 0.785, η2 = 0.004. There was no significant main effect
of either Site Order, F(1,29) = 0.325, p = 0.573, η2 = 0.011,
or Stress Level, F(1,29) = 0.030, p = 0.865, η2 = 0.001. The
interaction effects were not significant, for Site and Site Order,
F(1.24,35.84) = 0.421, p = 0.563, η2 = 0.014; for Site and Stress
Level, F(1.24,35.84) = 0.671, p = 0.449, η2 = 0.023.

EEG Response
For the effect of Frequency Band, we report Greenhouse–Geisser
correct results, as Mauchley’s test of sphericity was significant
[W = 0.145, 2(9) = 18.20, p = 0.035]. There was no significant
main effect of Site on the RMS of the EEG signal, F(2,22) = 0.656,

impacts of stressors associated with urban life may be mitigated
through the expansion of BGI.
In addition to the physiological metrics, we also asked
participants to report changes in mood states using a validated
self-report instrument. Again, effects on mood state varied
depending on participants’ pre-exposure stress levels. Those with
self-reported elevated stress levels in the week prior also reported
a reduction in negative feelings after 10 min in the wetland
compared with both the urban and control settings. This suggest
at least a temporary improvement in subjectively experienced
mood for those experiencing high stress in everyday life. In a
similar vein, Roe and Aspinall (2011b) found more beneficial
outcomes for adults in poor mental health during a rural walk.
Korpela et al. (2008) and Ottosson and Grahn (2008) suggested
that nature may have stronger restorative powers for people
experiencing greater emotional stress. The evidence thus suggests
that exposure to blue-green spaces can improve negative mood
states. Interestingly, irrespective of whether participants were
stressed prior to the experiment, a universal enhancement of
positive mood states was observed following exposure to the
wetland site, with people reporting feeling ‘attentive,’ ‘inspired,’
‘strong’ and ‘enthusiastic.’ This finding confirms the positive
association between blue-green space provision and hedonic
wellbeing or life satisfaction (for a review, see: Houlden et al.,
2017). Our findings therefore suggest that, in terms of subjective
experience, exposure to urban blue space may have a dual effect
of reducing stress and promoting more positive mood states, at
least temporarily.

technology the monitor the HWB co-benefits of urban bluegreen space.
Of the various physiological measures we acquired, only the
HR response was found to be significantly different between
exposure conditions. While acute cardiovascular responses to
nature have been noted in earlier studies (e.g., Lanki et al.,
2017), novel in our study was the finding that this effect
was contingent upon participants’ pre-exposure stress levels.
Participants with higher than average levels of stress in the
week prior to the experiment experienced an increase in HR in
the urban, but not the wetland setting, relative to the baseline
acquired indoors. As increased HR is an indicator of general
physiological arousal, exposure to urban environments appears
to cause a stress response, while wetland setting has a mitigating
effect. In contrast to previous studies in which decreased HR was
observed during exposure to green spaces relative to a control
(e.g., Song et al., 2013; South et al., 2015; Grazuleviciene et al.,
2015; Lanki et al., 2017), our findings suggest that acute exposure
to blue–green spaces may induce a subtle and short-term
moderation of cardiovascular stress reactivity. With the current
experimental design we can only correlate this finding with
the blue–green environment exposure, limiting the alignment
of our observations with existing theories in the field e.g., the
physiological and emotional stress moderation posited by Stress
Recovery Theory (Ulrich, 1983). Further research is required in
order to identify the mechanisms linking specific facets of the
wetland environments to this observed moderation. Only with
such advances can we begin to understand how the negative

modifications acceptable accuracy can be achieved with low-cost
systems (e.g., see Mavros et al., 2016). More research is required
to establish validated protocols, optimize the electrode setup,
and/or develop a range of bespoke modifications to increase
signal quality and overall stability for mobile experiments.
We experienced similar technical difficulties with
the acquisition and processing of some of the other
psychophysiological metrics, which may have produced the
negative findings on the HRV measures and indicators of EDA.
Despite promising results in laboratory settings using images
and 3-D simulations (e.g., Gladwell et al., 2012; Annerstedt
et al., 2013; Brown et al., 2013), studies that have examined
the effect of green space exposure on HRV (no studies have
specifically examined blue spaces) report mixed findings
(Kondo et al., 2018b). We hypothesize that this is due, at
least in part, to the heterogeneity in how HRV is quantified.
When derived using PPG, rather than ECG, measurements,
HRV analysis involves several sequential calculations and each
may apply different techniques (Michael et al., 2017). Despite
the practical advantages, PPG devices may not (yet) provide
useable HRV data suitable for monitoring and evaluating HWB
benefits. We concur with Gidlow et al. (2016) who suggest
that the level of noise in HRV recordings obtained under field
conditions hampers our ability to discern meaningful and/or
statistically significant differences in HRV response to changes in
environmental exposure.
Contrary to our expectations, we also found no difference
in EDA between the exposure conditions, despite the fact that
skin conductance is less susceptible to the confounding effect
of concurrent physical activity, and more closely linked to
psychological arousal or stress. Evidence from other studies
suggests that low-cost mobile sensors can provide data on par
with research-grade systems (Torniainen et al., 2015; Zangróniz
et al., 2017). One exploratory study found correlations between
EDA activity and urban design features, demonstrating in
particular that traversing green spaces was associated with
reduced stress responses (Fathullah and Willis, 2018). However,
as with the HRV data, a likely explanation for the negative finding
is the low EDA signal quality. Environmental factors such as
temperature and humidity, and a participant’s sweat production,
are known to affect EDA, which can lead to inconsistent results,
especially in field experiments and when analyzing short epochs
(e.g., Doberenz et al., 2011). Our analysis and interpretation of
the EDA data may also have been hampered by an inadequate
period for the baseline measure. The 10 min baseline obtained
in the control room did not provide sufficient insight into the
tonic aspect of the signal, which varies between individuals and
across normal diurnal patterns (e.g., Hot et al., 1999). In future
studies, an observational approach in which participants wear the
Empatica E4 monitor for a pre-experiment period of 24 h (or
longer) combined with GPS location services could provide rich
data that would allow direct comparisons in responses to various
urban design features in an ecologically valid manner.
In addition to the technological challenges outlined earlier,
we recognize a number of limitations associated with our
experimental design. Time constraints limited the environmental
exposure to a single wetland site, comprising both blue and green

Based on the evidence that the wetland setting may induce
both psychological and physical restoration, at least in those
susceptible to stress, we had also expected to find a sitedependent moderation of brain activity. In particular, a state
of relaxation or mediation would be associated with an
increase in power across the alpha and theta frequency bands.
However, only the high beta frequency band increased during
wetland exposure, consistent with a state of enhanced attention.
Under more controlled conditions (where participants passively
viewed a series of videos), Olszewska-Guizzo et al. (2018)
found increased power in the beta frequency band, located
in temporal brain during the observation of ‘contemplative’
spaces relative to ‘non-contemplative’ outdoor spaces. They
interpreted this pattern of brain activity as indicating more
holistic perceptual processing and/or attention driven toward
salient stimuli, associated with fascination. Increased beta-power
could therefore be consistent with a restoration effect driven by
involuntary attention shifts. There are good reasons, however,
to be cautious when interpreting the EEG results. Few studies
have attempted EEG measures in situ and across different
environmental gradients, and results have been inconsistent.
Previous studies using the Emotiv EEG technology applied
proprietary algorithms that automatically process and translate
the EEG signals into mental state indicators. Aspinall et al.
(2015) found lower ‘frustration,’ ‘engagement’ and ‘arousal,’
and higher ‘meditation’ when young participants walked into
green space, and higher ‘engagement’ when moving out of it.
Neale et al. (2017) reported that urban green space enhanced
older participants’ ‘engagement,’ whereas typical urban spaces
promoted EEG activity associated with ‘excitement.’ There is –
to our knowledge – no published research that reliably links
these ‘mental state’ indicators with specific neural activity. The
unconfirmed validity of this EEG analysis method led us instead
to process the raw signals to derive the frequency band data
within the EEG signal. Despite our attempts to improve electrode
conductance (e.g., using glycerol/saline solution as recommended
for longer measurement periods), our EEG observations are
consistent with significant signal deterioration. The outdoor
setting and an individual’s movements whilst walking increased
the likelihood of electrode displacement and signal interference.
These effects cannot be resolved through post hoc statistical
artifact correction. Significant loss of signal quality restricted the
quantity of data available for processing. In addition, the low
spatial resolution of the 14-channel Emotiv system precludes
analysis of signal origins, further complicating the interpretation
of the data (but see Chen et al., 2015 for an example of a basic
connectivity analysis demonstrating increased synchronicity in
EEG waves during exposure to a natural environment). We
report on averaged values across the full electrode network,
and this broad-stroke approach, further compromised by the
noisy signal due to acquisition problems, may have failed to
capture the more subtle variations in brain function. Perhaps
unsurprisingly, the user-friendliness and intuitive appeal of easyto-use, low-cost mobile EEG systems is traded off against data
quality. Research-grade systems are undoubtedly superior, but
they require substantial training and may not be suitable for
most mobile applications and limited budgets, and with some

Health Benefits of Urban Wetlands

plays in building health resilience (Roe, 2008; Roe and Aspinall,
2011a). Such studies would help tackle important evidence gaps
on the mechanisms around how differing natural and built
environments (or facets of those environments) contribute to
building or depleting individual resources. For example what
dose or exposure (Barton and Pretty, 2010; Cox et al., 2017;
White et al., 2019) or level of biodiversity (Aerts et al., 2018)
might be required to build resilience, and for whom? Such
studies might also advance findings on the beneficial effects of
nature that manifest even when participants are not exposed to
any psychological depletion (Beute and De Kort, 2014). Such
advances have important policy and advocacy implications for
those agitating for greater BGI provision in urban environments
for health and broader ecosystem services that benefit people.
As highlighted by Roe and Aspinall (2011b), the quasiexperimental design employed in field experiments presents a
number of limitations. First, it is difficult to control for the
many confounding variables that impact on participant comfort
and experience in outdoor environments. We managed this
to some extent with the timing of the experiment. We had
favorable weather and a capacity to stipulate testing days without
rain, wind or cold temperatures. Cloud cover was the most
variable weather feature, and we do anticipate that differences
in the level of sunshine are likely to stimulate variations in both
physiological and psychological response, as well as producing
additional risk of sweat-related artifacts on the EEG and EDA
measures. Variation between morning, lunch and afternoon
sessions potentially introduced diurnal physiological differences.
In the urban environment, when the general public unexpectedly
interrupted testing, we retested participants, however, we were
unable to control the number of passers-by in both urban and
wetland and how this may have affected participants. Another
possible confounding variable is prior experience and knowledge
of the site and surrounds.
Our experimental manipulation mimics the incidental nature
of exposure to BGI in urbanites (Keniger et al., 2013; Beery et al.,
2017). The results mainly illustrate the psychological (moodbased) effects of one-off blue-green space exposures in urban
settings, and highlight potential concomitant physiological effects
that require more detailed investigation. An interesting further
research direction concerns the issue of whether and how the
benefits of incidental exposure accumulate over time and across a
life course. It also remains to be demonstrated whether there are
any particular environmental characteristics or design features
in managed settings that produced the enhanced psychological
benefits. This level of detail was beyond the scope of the current
study, but a deeper understanding will be required to adequately
inform and optimize the implementation of BGI for mental and
physical health salutogenesis in urban areas.

elements, and an urban site. The environments vary on a great
number of variables, across a range of perceptual domains. This
precludes judgments on the specificity of the observed effects. It
remains unclear whether exposure to other types of blue and/or
green spaces could deliver similar benefits. The absence of a
green environment control (e.g., a municipal parkland) means
we are unable to determine the impact of urban wetland habitat
as opposed to any other non-built environment. As such our
conclusions are drawn using more generic terms around ‘blue–
green space’ as opposed to ‘blue space.’ Future studies should
incorporate a greater range of environmental stimuli to identify
specific elements producing strong effects, what the role of
biodiversity is (Dean et al., 2011; Dallimer et al., 2012; Clark et al.,
2014) and whether perceived or ‘objective’ quality and type of
habitat matters (Wheeler et al., 2015).
Due to the age range and anticipated variation in physical
condition within the participant sample, any psychophysiological
measure would be subject to large inter-individual variation,
which introduces measurement noise and impacts the detection
of statistically significant differences in a relatively small sample.
While our sample size compares favorably with similar quasiexperimental studies (Kondo et al., 2018b), we caution against
extrapolation, and emphasize the need to re-examine these effects
at different sites and with larger, and possibly more homogeneous
samples. Inter-individual variation may be mitigated by obtaining
more robust baselines against which exposure responses can be
compared, e.g., through unobtrusive 24-h measurements (Kondo
et al., 2018b). Such recordings are certainly possible with the PPG
wristband, but for the EEG measure, this remains impractical
for a wide range of applications as the individual needs to carry
the acquisition device (e.g., laptop) in addition to wearing the
headset. Furthermore, 70% percent of participants we queried
(21/30) reported discomfort from prolonged wearing of the
headset, with initial signs of irritation or physical discomfort
occurring during the experimental session. This may have caused
both technical problems (e.g., more movement artifacts) and
influenced the mental state of participants, confounding the EEG
results. Our experimental setup may have therefore tested the
limits of the current technology.
Our categorization of participants into self-reported stressed
and non-stressed (defined against normative UK data; Henry
and Crawford, 2005) has limitations because it does not fully
encompass the complexity of the environment-stress dynamic at
an individual level. Differing environments, personal experience
and individual capabilities are likely to interact to produce
differential psychological responses. For example, we have
assumed that the ‘self-reported high stress’ subset did so based on
a depletion in personal resource and that the ‘self-reported low
stress’ subset did so through a perceived lack of depletion. This
fails to recognize the role of ‘instoration’ (the accruing of adaptive
personal resources (e.g., self-esteem) beyond the restoration of
a deficit (Hartig et al., 1996). We also do not know the role the
environment plays in instoration. For example those reporting as
‘low stress’ might have experienced improved mental health by
residing in areas with good green or green-blue space provision
(White et al., 2013; Alcock et al., 2014). As such there is a
need for more instorative studies on the role the environment

CONCLUSION
In this experiment, we aimed to test the salutogenic potential
of an urban wetland, using commercially available, low
cost wearable technologies. Whilst only the most robust
physiological measure showed a differential response to the

the Imperial College Research Ethics Committee (ICREC) was
not required on the basis of this initial assessment. The above

Compliance (within the Joint Research Compliance Office) at

wetland environment compared to the urban environment, our
results are consistent with the hypothesis that exposure to blue–
green space promotes stress recovery. People that are already
experiencing a high level of stress may be at greater risk of
developing health problems due to an increased physiological
stress response in busy urban environments. At the same time,
individuals experiencing high stress appear to derive some relief
from negative mood states during green–blue space exposure,
which also enhances positive feelings in most people. Further
research is required to examine the degree to which the provision
of BGI in urban environments has preventative and curative
benefits, and to validate whether incidental exposure is sufficient
to achieve meaningful effects over long-term timeframes and
across a larger number of response variables.
Finally, our experience indicates that wearable monitoring
devices have an intuitive appeal with various stakeholders,
including the academic community, conservation organizations,
the public, and results may be persuasive with policy makers.
We urge vigilance amongst those considering implementing
this technology, to recognize the risk it poses in becoming a
fad across the environment sector, as has occurred with other
potential solutions in the past (Redford et al., 2013). The drive
toward an evidence-based approached risks being hijacked by
such a fad if the challenges of successfully navigating researchimplementation ‘spaces’ (Toomey et al., 2017) are subsumed
by the latest technological wizardry. We must therefore remain
vigilant as we work toward expanding the evidence base on public
health benefits as a robust argument for the conservation of blue
and green space in our urban environment.
