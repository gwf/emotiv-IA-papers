1. Introduction
Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology has been utilized in low probability of detection radar
and communications systems for decades since its inception from time domain
electromagnetics in the 1960s (Fontana, 2004). Interest in UWB for unique indoor
communications and positioning applications has skyrocketed since the FCC released its
notice of inquiry in 1998 and then opened up the 3.1-10.6 GHz and 22-29 GHz frequency
bands for UWB use in 2002 (FCC, 2002).
1.1 General overview of ultra-wideband technology for indoor positioning systems
A depiction of a typical indoor positioning system is shown in Figure 1 where the base
stations are connected to a master processing unit, and a reference tag is needed to bring the
mobile tag into the 3-D global coordinate frame. The use of time difference of arrival for 3-D
triangulation combined with leading-edge detection at the UWB receiver help mitigate the
stringent requirements needed in terms of base station synchronization and ranging
sensitivity to dense indoor multipath interference. Although the system architecture shown
in Figure 1 is well known and has been implemented in other wireless positioning systems
including GPS, realizing this architecture for high accuracy indoor 3-D positioning has
proven to be deceptively difficult.
Central difficulties in achieving high 3-D real-time accuracy for indoor localization systems
include indoor multipath interference, sampling-rate limitations, local oscillator phase noise,
phase center effects, system clock jitter and drift, etc. Many techniques have been proposed
for ranging in UWB positioning systems which includes (see Figure 2a): leading-edge
detection (Fontana, 2004), matched filter (Low et al., 2005), received signal strength (Ekahau
Inc, 2008), first peak detect (Alavi & Pahlavan, 2006), and peak search and subtract (Falsi et
al., 2006). The main limitation of peak detection algorithms (e.g. received signal strength,
first peak detect, and peak search and subtract) is assuming a priori information concerning
the received pulse shape. The matched filter is useful in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
environments in conjunction with leading-edge detection. In realistic indoor environments
which contain significant multipath interference, this introduces large 1-D ranging errors
resulting in poor overall 3-D accuracy (Figure 2b). In many current systems, a tunnel (or
square law) diode is used at the receiver for energy detection which integrates a nanosecond
of the incoming signal, putting an upper bound of roughly 5 cm on the 1-D ranging

accuracy even when using leading-edge detection (Fontana, 2004). The ranging limitations
due to multipath interference are compounded with sampling rate limitations. The use of
conventional analog-to-digital converters (ADC), even if 5-10 GSPS, places an upper bound
on the 1-D ranging accuracy of 5 cm.

1.1.1 Commercial systems
As shown in Table 1, current commercial UWB systems can achieve 3-D localization
accuracy in the range of 15 – 30 cm. A comparison of the DART Ultra-Wideband system
from Zebra Enterprise Solutions and the real-time location system (RTLS) from Ubisense is
given in Table 1 (Zebra Enterprise Solutions, 2011, Ubisense, 2011). As shown in Table 1, the
two systems share many commonalities including frequency range, operating range,
compact tag size, and overall 3-D accuracy. One major difference is the method of digital
communication: the Zebra Enterprise Solutions system uses UWB pulse-based modulation
whereas the Ubisense system uses a narrowband 2.4 GHz digital communication scheme.
Although 2.4 GHz communication is a more mature technology than UWB pulse-based
modulation, it has a distinct disadvantage in that it is much more susceptible to multipath
interference and may experience severe degradation depending on the operating
environment of the system. Figure 3 shows the two commercial systems. The Zebra
Enterprise Solutions system is shown in Figure 3a including the main controller and four
hubs while Figure 3b shows two different sized tags from the Ubisense RTLS.

Novel Applications of the UWB Technologies

Table 2 provides a summary of the various research groups utilizing these three approaches
for high accuracy indoor positioning. Similar accuracy levels (0.5-20 cm) have been achieved
for both carrier-based (Meier, 2007; Mahfouz, 2008; Zhang, 2010; Waldmann, 2008;
McEwan, 2004) and impulse-based (Low, 2005; Zetik, 2004; Ossberger, 2004; Fuiji, 2007)
UWB positioning systems, although carrier-based systems have shown the potential for mm
and sub-mm range accuracy even for 3-D indoor environments (Mahfouz, 2008; Zhang,
2010; Meier, 2007; McEwan, 2004). FMCW has proven to be a successful competing
technology for high accuracy positioning systems (Stelzer, 1999, 2004; Ellinger, 2007;
Mosshammer, 2007; Tragas, 2007; Feger, 2009). In the 5.8 GHz band for industrial, medical,
and scientific (ISM) applications, documented accuracy of 5-20 cm for 2-D has been achieved
(Stelzer, 2004; Ellinger, 2007; Mosshammer, 2007; Tragas, 2007). FMCW systems operating at
higher frequencies including 35 GHz and 77 GHz have achieved accuracy levels of 0.1 mm
(Stelzer, 1999, Feger, 2009) with the system described by Feger et al. working at ranges of up
to 10 m (Feger, 2009). The most recent FMCW trend is a European-wide push to create low
power wireless sensor networks built on 5.8 GHz FMCW technology (Ellinger, 2007;
Mosshammer, 2007; Tragas, 2007; Feger, 2009).
1.1.3 Available frequency bands
Wireless medical devices, for both positioning and communication, have stringent
requirements on the frequency bands in which they can operate. Table 3 highlights the
different bands both in the United States and Europe which can be used for indoor medical
applications for both narrowband and UWB applications. UWB has available frequency
bands from 3.1 – 10.6 GHz and 22 – 29 GHz in the U.S. Only portions of that 3.1 – 10.6 GHz
band are currently available in Europe. A number of telemetry bands exist in the U.S., and
both the U.S. and Europe have instrumentation, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands
available, mainly in the 300 MHz to 3 GHz range. As shown in Table 3, in vivo telemetry
applications typically use bands in the RF and lower microwave frequency range for
operation (i.e. 315 MHz, 402 – 405 MHz, and up to 1427 – 1432 MHz in the United States
while Europe uses 433.05 – 434.79 MHz and 868 – 870 MHz). In order to understand why
telemetry bands are not allocated above 1.43 GHz, it is necessary to look at the complex
permittivity of human tissues as done in Section 1.2.1, where losses greatly increase above 1
GHz. The UWB positioning system operates from 5.4 – 10.6 GHz in the upper region of the
3.1–10.6 GHz band while most wireless telemetry systems for in vivo operate at 433.92 MHz
in the 433.05 - 434.79 European ISM band and at 315 MHz for the U.S. ISM band. As shown
in Figure 4, the allocated band in the United States goes from 3-10.6 GHz at a power level of
-41.3 dBm/MHz. Compared to Europe, where the power level is required to be at -71.3
dBm/MHz from 4.8-6 GHz, -65 dBm/MHz from 8.5-10.6 GHz, and can only be at -41.3
dBm/MHz from 3.4-4.8 GHz if detect and avoid (DAA) circuitry is implemented to
minimize interference with other wireless systems operating in this band. Figure 5 compares
the UWB bands in Japan versus the United States. Similar to Europe, the Japanese
regulations also require DAA in the 3.4-4.8 GHz band. The main difference between the
European band and the Japanese band is in the no DAA band: in Europe, this exists from 68.5 GHz while in Japan, this band goes from 8.5-10.6 GHz. From looking at Figure 4 and
Figure 5, it is clear that the various restrictions imposed around the world make designing
one system for worldwide operation difficult to achieve. Multiple variations of a system
may be needed to meet the various worldwide regulations.

1.2 Microwave interaction with biological tissues
The electrical characteristics of biological tissues change dramatically from DC through
higher frequencies such as X-ray and gamma radiation. At very low frequencies (the kHz
range), the primary means through which electrical current travels through the body is
conduction via the extracellular matrix. At the visible frequency range and even higher in
ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray frequency ranges, most electromagnetic waves are able to pass
through biological tissues, with differing amounts of energy being absorbed by different
tissues. Between these two extremes lie the RF/Microwave frequency bands. Electrical
properties of biological tissues change dramatically over this frequency range. There are
specific techniques, such as coaxial probe dielectric measurements, which can be followed to
apply a uniform method for electrical characterization of biological tissues (or other lossy
media) over this frequency range.

RF/Microwave radiation is considered from 100 kHz – 300 GHz. Although the interaction
of radiation with biological tissues changes significantly over this range, there are some
similar properties that provide coherence for grouping RF/Microwave frequencies
together. First, over this whole frequency range radiation can be considered non-ionizing.
Ionizing radiation includes UV and X-ray, and these frequency ranges are characterized
by disruption of atomic structures. Second, it is convenient and useful to use
RF/Microwave frequencies for the purpose of radiating electromagnetic (EM) energy. At
low frequencies (LF) and extremely low frequencies (ELF), the wavelength of the
transmitting signal is much larger than the structures used in transporting it. Radiation at
LF and ELF is not typically seen. Conversely, the wavelengths in the RF/Microwave
range are comparable to their corresponding transmission lines (millimeter to meter in
size), which makes them ideal for radiation applications. Central to designing a
microwave system which utilizes biological tissues as a transmission medium is a
thorough understanding of the electrical properties of the tissues that will be exposed to
the EM energy. An enormous amount of research has been done in this area. This has
included use of a wide range of measurement techniques, testing on many different types
of animals as well as humans, and testing of biological tissues in different environments
(e.g. in vivo, in vitro, over a range of temperatures, etc.).
1.2.1 Complex permittivity
The complex permittivity is a common method used to characterize the electrical properties
of an arbitrary medium. Combined with other electrical parameters, such as conductivity
and skin depth, it can be used to provide complete electrical characterization. (1) shows the
basic definition of complex permittivity
∗

where the first term, ’, represents the capacitive nature of the tissue (amount of charge
stored in it) while ” characterizes the lossy nature of the medium. Using these two terms, it
is possible to calculate  and , which can then be used to characterize how an EM wave
behaves inside the medium (Vorst, 2006). (2) defines the loss tangent

angular frequency, σ is the conductivity, and , , ,, are defined in (1). (3) describes how to

where
Estimating the power dissipated provides a key metric in designing microwave systems
which utilize biological tissues as the propagation medium. The electrical losses can be
attributed to both ionic conduction and dipole rotation (Nelson, 1991)

(7)

where there is a dispersion peak in the loss factor whose size and place depends on the
relaxation time, , and dispersion factor . Figure 6 shows typical curves for the complex
permittivity of human tissues as modeled through the Cole-Cole equation (7) (Gabriel et al.,
1996). A multi-peak Cole-Cole equation (8) is used by Gabriel et al. and allows a parametric
model for complex permittivity to be established where multiple dispersion peaks and
relaxation times are taken into account (Gabriel et al., 1996).

The loss factor in an arbitrary medium (i.e. ε”) is due to both ionic conductivity and dipole
rotation, and dipole rotation is the primary means through which losses occur over the RF
and microwave frequency range. The various losses experienced through the microwave
frequency range are shown in Figure 7. The temperature increases the ionic conductivity,
which is the main reason the loss factor tends to increase with increases in temperature over
lower microwave frequency range (DC – 1 GHz) (Komarov, Wang, & Tang, 2005). Above 1
GHz, the effects due to ionic conductivity lessen, and the loss factor is primarily due to
dipole rotation (or free-water dispersion). This has the effect of decreasing the loss factor of
water-based tissues, at least over the range of 3 – 17 GHz, with increase in temperature.
Figure 8 shows how changes in temperature affect both ’ and ” for water over a range of
frequencies and temperatures (Komarov, Wang, & Tang, 2005). As Figure 8 shows in a
qualitative sense, over the microwave frequency range of interest (3-17 GHz), increases in
temperature tend to decrease ’ by an almost consistent amount (decrease of ~8 for an
increase in temperature of 25C) and also tend to decrease ”.

Wang, & Tang, 2005)
Since most biological tissues are highly water-based, especially muscle and liver, they tend
to follow similar trends for variation of complex permittivity over a range of temperatures.
The change in complex permittivity of water is mostly due to the change in viscosity that
occurs in water for varying temperatures. For example, a 32.4% decrease in viscosity of
water is observed when going from 20C to 37C. This causes a decrease in the relaxation
time  of approximately 38.2%.

2. State-of-the-art in wireless medical systems
The introduction of reliable low cost wireless technologies has significantly changed the
medical industry over the past decade. There is a great demand for wireless medical
equipment, most noticeably in the patient monitoring and personal health care. The primary
reason for migrating from wired tools to wireless solutions is to eliminate the clumsy and
restrictive wirings. It improves the overall efficiency by allowing multiple medical
equipments to be controlled and monitored wirelessly by one single terminal device. The
following sections illustrated a few of the commercially available wireless medical devices,
as well as a number of researches being conducted.

2.1 Commerical devices
Vital signs monitoring devices are the most common medical systems being implemented
with wireless technologies. Wireless blood pressure monitoring systems shown in Figure 9
can be used either in doctor office or for personal health monitoring. The wireless blood
pressure cuff, as shown in Figure 10, was developed by SunTech and the Harvard Sensor
Network Labs. They can be used by paramedics while responding to emergency. Wireless
Oximeter (Figure 11) can measure the blood oxygen level of the patient up to 120 hours
continuous monitoring from a fully charged battery. Figure 12 shows a wireless ECG
monitoring device. It supports up to 12 channels and can be used continuously for 24 hours
on a fully charged battery. This particular device demonstrates one of the great
improvements for wireless medical system, which is enhancing the mobility of the patients.
It allows nonstop monitoring of the patients’ ECG and eliminates the need to attach and
removing the ECG electrodes while being transferred around the hospital. A wireless EEG
headset is shown in Figure 13. The current system support 14 sensors and can be used up to
12 hours on a full battery.

While the devices mentioned above are used primary in hospital, there is also a great effort
to develop personal healthcare devices to improve the quality of life of the patients. Devices
such as glucometer, insulin pump and alcoholmeter have also been incorporated wirelessly
with personal mobile devices (Figure 14 - Figure 16). In the recent years, a lot of focus has
been given to minimally invasive methods to collect data for diagnosis. One of the most
popular solutions to collect information within the gastrointestinal (GI) track is to use
capsule camera as shown in Figure 17. The images taken are transmitted wirelessly to a
computer to process. The capsule has also demonstrated the capability of producing images
to help with diagnosis that cannot be accomplished with ordinary endoscopy and
radiological methods.

Apart from ambulatory and personal medical devices, wireless surgical tracking devices
have also been developed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis and surgery.
Image guidance surgical navigation system uses optical and electromagnetic trackers to
track the surgical instruments in the attempt to minimize the human error during surgery.
Optical system (Figure 18), uses two infrared cameras to triangulate the position of the
target instrument. Figure 19 shows an electromagnetic tracking device developed by
Ascension and GE healthcare. The system provides real time feedback of the current
position of the biopsy needle, as well as the needle path projection.

2.2 Current research
The commercially available devices mentioned in previous section have undergone many
years of research and development. The following section is going to look at some of the
current researches being done with wireless medical device.
While there are many wireless ambulatory monitoring systems mentioned above, most of
them operate in a standalone mode with its own receiver. It would be more beneficial to the
physicians and health care professional to centralize all the information into one single
device. Tia Gao et al. introduced a wireless sensor network (WSN) system for medical
devices. (Gao, et al., 2008) The information from the sensors is wirelessly transmitted to the
server, and it can be accessed through handheld devices and computers (Figure 20). The
authors tested the system along with medical professions in a mock emergency situation
with satisfying results. Another focus of the research is to develop applications from the
sensor technologies. Pekka Iso-Ketola et al. developed a wireless medical device using an
accelerometer to monitor patient’s posture after total hip replacement (THR) surgery (Figure
21). (Iso-Ketola et al., 2008) The devices are also given to the patient such that they can
monitor and follow the precautions given by the surgeons.

Shyamal Patel et al. developed a network of wireless acceleration sensing nodes that are
attached to different sections of the patient’s body as shown in Figure 22 (Patel, et al., 2009).
The data collected were analyzed. The calculated parameter can help with the diagnosis of
the severity of Parkinson’s disease. Stacy Bamberg et al. developed a wireless gait analysis
system. A force measuring system is placed within a shoe, and a triaxial accelerometers and
gyroscopes attached on the outside of the shoes as shown in Figure 23. (Morris & Paradiso,
2002) The sensors measure the forces and motion on the foot during gait.

Aside from the patient monitoring and diagnostic tool, several research groups have been
concentrated on implantable medical devices. The technology to design and fabricate microelectromechanical system (MEMS) sensors and application specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
enables embedded measuring systems to be made in an extremely compact fashion. It is
now possible to measure in-vivo condition that was once impossible. Graichen Friedmar et
al. developed a complete embedded system to measure strain within a Humerus implant
(Figure 24) (Graichen et al., 2007). Antonius Rohlmann et al. also completed an embedded
system to measure the post operative load of spiral implants wirelessly as shown in Figure
25 (Rohlmann et al., 2007). D’Lima and Colwell modified existing knee implants with four
load sensors to measure the in-vivo stress on the implant after the total knee arthoplasty
(Figure 26) (D'Lima et al., 2005). Chun-Hao Chen et al. designed a wireless Bio-MEMS
system to measure the C-reactive proteins as shown in Figure 27 (Chen, et al., 2009).

Measuring the forces and contact areas in vivo is extremely valuable to researchers, implant
designers, clinicians, and patients. Measuring these values post operatively allows for
evaluation of the performance of current designs and prediction of future design
performance. Data on the in vivo load state of joint replacement components is required to
understand the structural environment and wear characteristics of that component. Normal
loads, load center, contact area, and the rate of loading need to be measured in order to fully
understand the kinematics and kinetics of the orthopedic implant. This data can be used to
help patients by allowing clinician to monitor implant kinematics, wear, and function. In the
cases of predicted premature wear, preventative measures such as orthotics, bracing, or
physical therapy could be used to avert the need for revision procedures. Additionally, one
of the major postoperative concerns was inflection. Currently, there is no effective way to
prevent it until symptoms are developed. Biosensing devices that react to disease related
protein can monitor and alert physicians to administrate antibiotic during early stage of the
infection.

3. Wireless signal propagation in hospital environments
The main concern with using wireless tracking and communication technology in the
operating room (OR) and other hospital environments is the high level of scatterers and
corresponding multipath interference experienced when transmitting wireless signals.
While the experiment from Clarke et al. provides quantitative data on how wireless realtime positioning systems perform in the OR, it is also useful to look into narrowband and
UWB channels and their effect on narrowband and UWB signals for communication and
positioning applications (Clarke & Park, 2006). There are two typical approaches used when
modeling wireless channels: the first is statistical models used to model generic
environments (e.g. industrial, residential, commercial, etc.), which incorporate LOS or nonline-of-sight (NLOS) measurements taken in the time and frequency domains, which are
then used in setting the parameters of these statistical models. The second method uses ray
tracing techniques to model specific geometrical layouts (e.g. buildings, cities) and can
provide a more accurate depiction of which obstacles and structures will have the greatest
effect on wireless propagation. The drawback with ray tracing is the static nature of the
results (i.e. results are only valid for a certain scenario of objects placed in the scene). Even if
the wireless systems in the operating room are static, other objects will not be including
people, patients, the operating table, and medical equipment.
3.1 Channel modelling in the operating room
A useful technique for modeling the operating room channel is to take time domain and
frequency domain measurements in the operating room. This can be done both during
surgery (live) and not during surgery (non-live) with variable Tx-Rx distances (e.g. 0.5 m to
4 m). Figure 28 and Figure 29 show the time domain and frequency domain setups to collect
data in the OR. Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the live and non-live setups where the layout
of the dual OR is shown to highlight the Tx and Rx locations for both the live and non-live
experiments. Note that both monopole and single element Vivaldi antennas are used for
transmission and reception. The basic strategy in the time domain is to send out a narrow
UWB pulse, either baseband or modulated by a carrier signal, in the 3.1-10.6 GHz band
approved by the FCC. Indoor measurements can also be measured at bands higher than the
standard 3.1- 10.6 GHz (e.g. 22-29 GHz) with the understanding that the effective isotropic

radiated power (EIRP) is limited to -51.3 dBm/MHz rather than the -41.3 dBm/MHz
available in the lower band (FCC, 2002). Figure 32 shows the experimental setup during the
non-live case (Figure 31) for obtaining both time and frequency domain data while Figure 33
shows the experimental setup during an orthopedic surgery. When performing
measurements in the frequency domain, the typical approach is to use a vector network
analyzer to sweep across the UWB frequency range (e.g. 3.1 – 10.6 GHz) and measure the Sparameter response of the channel where a UWB signal is passed between a transmitting
and receiving antenna. The inverse Fourier transform can then be used to convert the signal
from a frequency response into an impulse response in the time domain. This allows
frequency dependent fading and path loss as well as the RMS delay spread and power delay
profile measurements to be obtained. In Figure 29, a vector network analyzer is used to
collect data for frequency domain measurements.

3.2 Experimental results
Table 4 shows a truncated list of parameters for the LOS operating room environment fit to
the IEEE 802.15.4a channel model which were obtained with time domain and frequency
domain experimental data. Figure 34 shows the pathloss for the OR environment obtained
by fitting experimental data and compared to residential LOS, commercial LOS, and
industrial LOS. The pathloss in the OR is most similar to residential LOS, although this can
change depending on which instruments are placed near the transmitter and receiver or the
locations of the UWB tags and base stations in the room. Figure 35 shows pathloss obtained
for a Tx-Rx distance of 0.49 m where the transmitting (monopole) and receiving (Vivaldi)
antenna effects have been removed. Small scale fading effects can be seen as well as
frequency dependent pathloss, which is captured in the parameter in Table 4.
Figure 36 shows an example time domain signal where significant multipath interference is
caused by reflections from metal tables and walls. Figure 37 shows an example time domain
received signal for a Tx-Rx distance of 1.49 m using the monopole antenna for transmitting
and single element Vivaldi antenna for receiving. A decaying exponential is overlayed on
the received signal to highlight the intra-cluster decay, defined by γ0 = 1.33 in Table 4. The
pathloss of the LOS OR channel is most like a residential LOS environment whereas the
power delay profile (PDP) is closer to an industrial LOS environment (γ0 = 0.651) where
dense clusters of multipath quickly decay (rather than the residential LOS environment
where γ0 = 12.53). The mean number of clusters ( = ) is in between the residential and
industrial LOS environments ( = and = .7 ). The inter-cluster decay constant and
inter-cluster arrival rate (Λ and Γ) for the operating room channel are more similar to the
industrial LOS channel rather than the commercial or residential LOS channels. The
operating room LOS channel is similar to the industrial LOS channel in its time domain
characteristics (i.e. multipath interference and decay) while it is similar to the residential
LOS channel in its frequency domain characteristics.

3.3 Electromagnetic interference in the operating room
Electromagnetic interference (EMI) in the OR was measured across a wide frequency range
in the context of comparing the interference present in useable frequency bands for
narrowband and UWB communication and localization systems (for available bands see
Table 3).
3.3.1 OR indoor environment
EMI was measured over a large frequency band (200 MHz – 26 GHz) in the OR during four
separate orthopedic surgeries. Figure 38 shows the experimental setup in the OR. Besides
the operating table, numerous other pieces of medical equipment were present during the
surgery including an anesthesia machine, ventilator, surgical lamps, various monitoring

www.intechopen.com

298

Novel Applications of the UWB Technologies

equipment, visualization screens, carts containing necessary orthopedic surgical tools, drills,
etc. Also, numerous people were present including the surgical team, orthopedic company
representatives, and spectators observing the surgery. The combination of people and
medical equipment closely packed into the OR creates a dense multipath indoor
environment that can greatly disrupt standard RFID tracking systems. UWB systems have
inherent advantages that make them a strong candidate for use in dense multipath
environments such as the OR.
3.3.1 Experimental setup
Various hardware was needed to get accurate measurements across the wide band of 200
MHz – 26 GHz. It should be noted that all reported gain and noise figure values are
averages across the frequency range of operation. Figure 39 shows the four antennas used to
cover the entire frequency range. The standard setup for each of the frequency bands
measured included an antenna, two stages of amplification, and a spectrum analyzer for
visualization. Commercial off-the-shelf components were used whenever possible. Table 3
lists the major medical, scientific, and UWB frequency bands in the US and Europe. A
majority of the scientific and medical bands in both Europe and the US fall between the
frequencies of 200 MHz – 3 GHz. Also, most RFID systems operate in the MHz range up to 3
GHz. Even though RFID systems can operate at 5.8 GHz or 24.125 GHz, limitations still exist
on how well a system with small bandwidth can handle the dense multipath environment of
the OR at these high frequencies. When looking at different wireless bands currently in use,
whether WLAN, cellular phones, GPS, or medical, the advantages of operating in the higher
frequency bands of 3.1 – 10.6 GHz and 22 – 29 GHz useable for UWB become clear.

Fig. 38. Experimental setup in the OR.
3.3.2 Experimental results
Electromagnetic interference was measured over the frequency range of 200 MHz – 26 GHz.
The results from these measurements can be seen in Figure 40-42. A number of signals were
detected in the lower frequency range of 400 MHz – 2.5 GHz. As shown in Figure 40, no
appreciable signals were picked up between 200 – 800 MHz. Although there is a small spike
near 470 MHz, it is only 6dB above the noise floor and is considered noise. Also, there are no
licensed frequency bands in the US that could correspond to the 470 MHz peak. Figure 41
shows the frequency band from 800 MHz – 3 GHz. A number of different signals were

www.intechopen.com

The Future of Ultra Wideband Systems in Medicine: Orthopedic Surgical Navigation

299

found in this frequency range. The two strongest signals, which were found at 872 MHz and
928 MHz, correspond to CDMA2000 uplinks and downlinks. The peak at 1.95 GHz also
corresponds to a US cellular band. Finally, the peak at 2.4 GHz is caused by WLAN and
Bluetooth components. Figure 42 shows the frequency band from 3 – 26 GHz. No noticeable
signals were picked up across this entire band. This is somewhat unexpected since there are
ISM and WLAN bands between 5 – 6 GHz, which could be the major culprit causing
interference that could affect UWB systems.

The frequency bands containing noticeable EMI correspond to widespread technologies that
will likely be seen in the average OR. One surprise was the almost complete absence of US
scientific and medical bands. Many medical devices do conduct wireless operations at the
frequency bands summarized in Table 3, but besides the WLAN signal at 2.4 GHz seen in
Figure 41, no significant EMI corresponding to these frequency bands was detected in the
OR. As outlined in Table 3, there is another UWB frequency band from 22 – 29 GHz that can
be used for localization systems. As seen from Figure 42, there is no EMI in the band from 22
– 26 GHz. One reason for having no EMI is that very few licensed bands exist between 22 –
29 GHz that would affect an OR. Also, signals in this frequency band tend to be attenuated

localization in the OR holds a distinct advantage over other technologies because of both the
large bandwidth used as well as the higher frequencies available for operation.

4. High accuracy positioning systems for indoor environment
Although UWB positioning systems are well established in their use for indoor applications
requiring 3-D real-time accuracy on the level of 10-15 cm, current commercial systems have
not been able to meet the stringent accuracy specifications (e.g. 1-2 mm or sub-mm 3-D) of
the next level of applications including smart medical instruments, surgical navigation, and
tracking in wireless body-area-networks.
4.1 Development of a high accuracy ultra-wideband positioning system
The challenges in developing a millimeter range accuracy real-time non-coherent UWB
positioning system include: generating ultra-wideband pulses, pulse dispersion due to
antennas, modeling of complex propagation channels with severe multipath effects, need for
extremely high sampling rates for digital processing, noise and sensitivity of the UWB

The Future of Ultra Wideband Systems in Medicine: Orthopedic Surgical Navigation

301

receiver, local oscillator phase noise (in the case of a carrier-based system), antenna phase
center variation, time scaling, jitter, and degradation due to overall system calibration. For
such a high precision system with mm or even sub-mm accuracy, all these effects should be
accounted for and minimized. The complete setup of the non-coherent UWB positioning
system is shown in Figure 43. The source of the non-coherent UWB positioning system is a
step-recovery diode (SRD) based pulse generator with a pulse width of 300 ps and
bandwidth of greater than 3 GHz. The Gaussian pulse is up-converted with an 8 GHz carrier
and then transmitted through an omni-directional monopole UWB antenna. Multiple base
stations are located at distinct positions to receive the modulated pulse signal. The received
modulated Gaussian pulse at each base station first goes through a directional Vivaldi
receiving antenna and then is amplified through a low noise amplifier (LNA) and
demodulated to obtain the I signal. Only one channel rather than I/Q is required since
energy detection and carrier offsets are also applied at the UWB receiver. After going
through a low pass filter (LPF), the I channel is sub-sampled using an UWB sub-sampling
mixer, extending the signal to a larger time scale while maintaining the same pulse shape
(Zhang et al., 2007). The PRF clocks are set to be 10 MHz with an offset frequency of 1-2 kHz
between the tag and base stations which corresponds to an equivalent sampling rate of 50100 GS/s. Finally, the extended I channel is processed by a conventional analog to digital
converter (ADC) and standard FPGA unit. Leading-edge detection is performed on the
FPGA. The time sample indices are sent to a computer where additional filtering and the
final time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) steps are performed to localize the 3-D position of
the UWB tag.

Fig. 43. System architecture of non-coherent UWB positioning system which includes a
carrier-based transmitted signal at the tag and a combination of downconversion and
energy detection at the UWB receiver.
To detect narrow pulses on the order of a few hundred picoseconds (i.e. 300 ps or 3 GHz
bandwidth in our system), analog to digital converters with at least 6 GS/s are needed to
satisfy the Nyquist criterion. However, such high performance ADC units are currently

www.intechopen.com

302

Novel Applications of the UWB Technologies

either not commercially available or too expensive for most applications. A realistic
alternative approach to real-time sampling is to sub-sample the UWB pulses while
maintaining the initial pulse shape through extended time techniques. The extended UWB
signals can then be handled by readily available commercial ADCs, reducing overall system
cost (Zhang et al., 2007). The sampler utilizes a simple broadband balun structure and a
balanced topology.
The non-coherent architecture of the current UWB positioning system places stringent
requiremens on phase noise specifications of the local oscillators at the transmitter and
receiver. The use of a reference tag partially mitigates the local oscillator phase noise and
temperature effects at the UWB receivers. Even with a reference tag, the phase noise
presents a formidable challenge to achieving millimeter 3-D real-time accuracy. High phase
noise carriers (e.g. free running voltage controlled oscillators) cause up to an order of
magnitude (e.g. cm) greater error than low phase noise carriers. When attempting to achieve
millimeter and sub-mm accuracy, phase center variation of the antennas at the Tx/Rx is an
important source of error which needs to be taken into account. The transmitter employs a
UWB monopole antenna which provides an omni-directional radiation pattern with
minimal phase center variation while the receiver utilizes a single element Vivaldi antenna
for a radiation pattern directed at the view volume of interest. Noticeable variation of the
phase center is observed in both the E and H cuts especially for angles greater than ±30°.
High accuracy positioning systems must employ calibration techniques to remove the phase
center effects. For example, antennas used for GPS systems go through an advanced
automated calibration process which uses high precision robots to move the antennas to
6000-8000 distinct points in calibrating out phase center effects. More challenges appear in
achieving high accuracy real-time indoor positioning at the system-level. Cable length
effects at the UWB receivers must be accounted for and statically calibrated and removed
from the system. Time scaling effects due to system clock drift must be characterized and
calibrated out of the final TDOA calculations in a dynamic manner when moving around
the view volume. Time scaling effects change across the view volume due to the differences
in LOS ranges ri between the tag and each base station. The 3-D variation must be calibrated
out in order to get a highly accurate indoor positioning system achieving stable millimeter
range accuracy. Future improvements for this UWB indoor positioniong system include the
addition of real-time, multi-tag access (Kuhn et al., 2011) and utilizing comprehensive
simulation frameworks for accurate simulation of advanced mixed signal systems in
realistic indoor environments (Kuhn et al., 2010).
4.2 Real-time experimental results
Two 3-D experiments with unsynchronized LOs and PRF clock sources were carried out,
where a minimum of four base stations are needed for the 3-D measurements.
4.2.1 3-D dynamic free motion
Figure 44 shows a four base station setup where the 3-D positions were measured for each
base station utilizing the Optotrak 3020 system, which also serves as a reference for
comparing the 3-D real-time accuracy of our UWB localization system. The Optotrak 3020
has 3-D real-time accuracy of better than 0.3 mm. It should be noted that the spatial spread
of the base stations along the z-axis is the largest (2498 mm), while the x-axis is the smallest

The Future of Ultra Wideband Systems in Medicine: Orthopedic Surgical Navigation

(1375 mm). In the dynamic mode, the tag is moving randomly inside the 3-D space as shown
in Figure 44. The 3-D motion of the tag is then plotted and UWB measurements are
compared with Optotrak measurements. RMSE is used to report the error since it is the true
unbiased error when data values fluctuate above and below zero. Figure 45 plots the UWB
trace and Optotrak trace in the 3-D dynamic mode.
Figure 46 shows the 3-D dynamic errors in the x, y, and z axes over 1000 measured points.
The overall 3-D RMSE is 6.37 mm. The error along the x-axis contributed most to the overall
distance error, which can be explained by the limited spatial spread of base stations along
the x-axis and can be calculated using the PDOP definitions in (Mahfouz et al., 2008). Such
error can be mitigated through better arrangement of the base stations along the x-axis.

4.2.2 3-D robot tracking
The next non-coherent 3-D experiment is to dynamically track the robot position. The
monopole antenna and the reference Optotrak probe are tied together and fixed to the arm
of the CRS A465 robot. The robot arm set up is shown in Figure 47. Finally, the base stations
can be seen in Figure 48. The robot was pre-programmed to specifically cover 20 distinct
static positions in a 3-D volume, stopping for three seconds at each position and then
moving to the next position and so on. The measured traces by the UWB system are
compared to the Optotrak reference system as shown in Figure 49. Figure 50 shows the 20
distinct static positions taken by both the UWB and the Optotrak systems. The overall
dynamic 3-D robot tracking RMSE is 5.24 mm. In Table 5 the real-time non-coherent 3-D
experimental results are summarized under various scenarios. The reported RMSE are
based on 1000 continuous data points recorded and compared to the Optotrak 3020 system,
which served as the real-time reference of our UWB localization system and provides a 3-D
accuracy of better than 0.3 mm.

5. Wireless MEMS sensors used as feedback control in an orthopedic
surgical navigation system
Over the past decade, orthopedic companies have been trying different methods and
protocols to eliminate one of the primary causes of implant failure in total knee
arthroplasty (TKA), which is the malalignment of the implants to the biomechanical axis
of the patient. To properly place the implant, the gaps after the resections between the
femur and tibia during extension and 90 degrees flexion have to be parallel to each other
and the gap size have to be the same (Figure 51). However, the surgeons are usually
working with a small incision with limited access to the joint. Moreover, the knee joint are
stabilized by the medial and lateral collateral ligaments. The laxity of the ligaments can
affect the gap balance.

The Future of Ultra Wideband Systems in Medicine: Orthopedic Surgical Navigation

307

In order to help the surgeons to assess the tightness of the joint after resection, an
instrument was designed to provide quantitative feedback to the users. A wireless strain
measuring device was designed. The high level system design is shown in Figure 52. Two
types of sensors were investigated in the design of this instrument. The first type of sensor is
piezo-resistive based microcantilever as shown in Figure 53. When a piezo-resistive element
undergoes stress, the resulting strain causes changes in the resistance of the material. Hence,
it is possible to use to measure strain by monitoring the resistance of the material.

© 2008 IEEE

Fig. 52. High level design of a wireless strain measuring system (Qu et al., 2008)
The piezo-resistive microcantilevers here are used to measure a macro pressure that causes a
deflection in the microcantilever beam. The microcantilevers are tiny and extremely fragile. In
addition, silicon is not a FDA-approved biocompatible material unless specifically doped. This
specific application to measure macro forces requires a protective layer with a material that
damps the applied stress and provides a biocompatible interface for bodily contact. Medical
grade epoxy was used as a protective material for the sensors as well as providing a biocompatible surface to interface with the soft tissues. The epoxy was cured over the
microcantilevers to protect and to give a desirable force readout range. Curing procedures and
epoxy homogeneity were investigated to create the most reliable, non-interfering
encapsulation. Parameters investigated included viscosity, cure time, working time, heat cure,
and minimization of bubbles and microbubbles. EP30MED (Masterbond, Inc.) was chosen as
the most favorable epoxy for encapsulation. A microcantilever that was encapculated with a
2mm thick epoxy was used for mechanical testing as shown in Figure 54. An Instron 5544
testing machine was used. The properties of the encapsulated sensor are shown in Table 6.

Table 6. Properties of microcantilever encapsulated in 2mm of EP30MED (Qu et al., 2010)
The readout circuit for the microcantilever system was tested with off-the-shelf components
using an MSP430 (Texas Instrument) as microcontroller, ADG726 (Analog Device) as
multiplexer, INA331A2 (Texas instrument) as instrumental amplifier, and MAX1472/1473
as transmitter and receiver. The readout circuit is too bulky to be fitted inside a surgical
instrument. As a result, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) is designed
specifically for the reading of the microcantilever sensors. The ASIC includes the
multiplexer, signal conditioning circuit, analog to digital converter (ADC), and a buffer
interfacing with the transmitter. The footprint of the ASIC is shown in Figure 55. The
specification of the ASIC is shown in Table 7. The gain of the amplifier can be adjusted via
an external resistor. After examining the outputs of the microcantilever, the gain was
configured to 72. The overall system RSS error with microcantilever embedded within 2mm
thick of EP30MED is approximately +/- 1.79kPa.

The final design of the instrument is designed to fit within a spacer block (Figure 56). The
spacer block is placed within the resection gap to identify the tightness of the joint.
Moreover, identifying the location of the high strain area can help the surgeons in balancing
the joint with appropriate ligaments release. The system design is separated into 3 layers.
An array of 30 microcantilever are arranged and wirebonded onto the circuit board. The
bottom most circuit board is the ASIC and the battery layer as shown in Figure 57. Two
switches are used to connect the poly Li+ batteries to the electronics and sensors. Traditional
coin cell batteries are not suitable for this design as they are too large in size and they are
incapable of powering all 30 microcantilevers, which is about 70mA. The poly Li+ batteries
can be made in customable shape and they are rechargeable. For the prototype, a USB socket
is used to recharge the batteries. High density sockets are used to connect the ASIC layer to
the sensors layer.

required from traditional whipped antenna. The assembled PCB is shown in Figure 57. Each
side of the PCBs has 15 active sensing microcantilevers and 1 additional microcantilever for
reference on the left side of the PCB.

The second type of sensor being investigated was capacitive based MEMS device. Strain
sensing is accomplished by embedding pairs of electrodes with specific geometries in a
biocompatible material. Deformation of the embedding materials causes changes in the
configuration of the capacitor electrodes. However fabricating MEMS devices on polymeric
materials is not as straight forward as with silicon substrate. Researchers have shown that
polyimide can be used as a substrate material, and parylene can be used as the dielectric
material (1.5 m). It is noted that parylene has served as a substrate layer in early capacitve
fabrication when the sensor was left on the silicon wafer, but it poses a problem due to
adhesion and mechanical strength of the thin film during removal from the silicon substrate.
A negative-resist based photolithography fabrication was implemented to reduce time and
number of steps for fabrication. The electrodes consist of a 10 nanometer (nm) titanium
adhesion layer and 300 nm of gold deposited on the substrate via physical vapor deposition.
Array design is multi-faceted to understand the behavior of the sensors at a small scale and
to optimize design to boost readout speed, increase nominal capacitance, and decrease
crosstalk and parasitic effects specific to the configuration of this array. Increasing nominal
capacitance is most easily achieved through larger electrode size and thinner dielectric
layers, thus presenting a tradeoff between keeping sensor size to a minimum and nominal

capacitance at an appropriate level for accurate measurement. Similarly, the spacing needs
to be optimized between closeness (providing high spatial resolution across the array), and
crosstalk (sensors too close to one another affecting readout). A uniaxial and triaxial strain
measuring device was fabricated as shown in Figure 58.

An array of sensors was tested using an MTS (Eden Prairie, MN) 858 Table Top System
mechanical testing machine with a 2.5 kN load cell. The load profile is shown in Figure 59. A
protective polyimide layer was placed over the electrodes and a second protective layer over
the entire assembly. Unlike the microcantilever sensors, no protective epoxy layer was
required. Similar to the piezoresistive microcantilever, a transition was made from using offthe-shelf IC to ASIC electronics for the capacitive MEMS sensors. An ASIC consisting of
diode array, matched capacitor capacitance to voltage converter and a custom designed
instrumental amplifier as shown in Figure 60.

The capacitive MEMS sensors can be fabricated at high density such that hundreds of
sensors can be placed within the same area as the microcantilever system. Addressing and
processing these sensors, as well as transmitting these data at a high speed manner are some
of the major challenges in this system.

6. Conclusion
Wireless medical devices can greatly improve efficiency and productivity for the healthcare
sector. Current wireless technologies enable compact design and are inexpensive to
manufacture. With the increasing amount of personal information being monitored and
transmitted wirelessly, security measures are one future trend in wireless technology
research. Protecting patient privacy is a vital aspect in remote patient monitoring systems.
Despite the increasing number of commercial wireless medical products, many of them use
different wireless protocols, and data are transferred at various data rates. Hence, one of the
focuses will be increasing the degree of integration for wireless medical healthcare
monitoring systems. There will also be an increasing use of implantable and ingestible
wireless medical devices, as it provides means to access and gather data and information
that were previously impossible.
As research advances, there will be a demand for higher resolution to improve the accuracy
of indoor wireless positioning systems. Highly accurate wireless positioning has many
applications in medicine including computer assisted surgery, smart surgical instruments,
and accurately locating sensors in body area networks. As the amount of integration and the
complexity of the system increases, the current wireless protocols will not be sufficient to
provide a large enough bandwidth for real time applications. Thus, high speed, high data
rate design and protocols will be needed in future wireless technologies.
While it is important to research and develop more advanced wireless medical devices, it is
also important to focus on application development for these devices. The ultimate goal for
biomedical devices is to provide tools to assist the physicians, and to improve the quality of
life of the patients. Application development plays a crucial role in developing these
instruments. It is also worth mentioning that some of the devices measured in this article are
very similar to each other, in which they share the same basic components. However, they
are fine tuned to be used in different applications, and this is critical in developing a device
robust enough to meet the stringent requirements of the medical field.

Ultra wideband (UWB) communication systems are characterized by high data rates, low cost, multipath
immunity, and low power transmission. In 2002, the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) legalized low
power UWB emission between 3.1 GHz and 10.6 GHz for indoor communication devices stimulating rapid
development of UWB technologies and applications. The proposed book Novel Applications of the UWB
Technologies consists of 5 parts and 20 chapters concerning the general problems of UWB communication
systems, and novel UWB applications in personal area networks (PANs), medicine, radars and localization
systems. The book will be interesting for engineers and researchers occupied in the field of UWB technology.
