Music is known to have the power to induce strong emotions. The present study
assessed, based on Electroencephalography (EEG) data, the emotional response of
terminally ill cancer patients to a music therapy intervention in a randomized controlled
trial. A sample of 40 participants from the palliative care unit in the Hospital del Mar in
Barcelona was randomly assigned to two groups of 20. The first group [experimental
group (EG)] participated in a session of music therapy (MT), and the second group
[control group (CG)] was provided with company. Based on our previous work on EEGbased emotion detection, instantaneous emotional indicators in the form of a coordinate
in the arousal-valence plane were extracted from the participants’ EEG data. The
emotional indicators were analyzed in order to quantify (1) the overall emotional effect
of MT on the patients compared to controls, and (2) the relative effect of the different
MT techniques applied during each session. During each MT session, five conditions
were considered: I (initial patient’s state before MT starts), C1 (passive listening), C2
(active listening), R (relaxation), and F (final patient’s state). EEG data analysis showed a
significant increase in valence (p = 0.0004) and arousal (p = 0.003) between I and F in
the EG. No significant changes were found in the CG. This results can be interpreted as
a positive emotional effect of MT in advanced cancer patients. In addition, according to
pre- and post-intervention questionnaire responses, participants in the EG also showed
a significant decrease in tiredness, anxiety and breathing difficulties, as well as an
increase in levels of well-being. No equivalent changes were observed in the CG.

INTRODUCTION
Music is known to have the power to induce strong emotions and effectively impact the mood
of individuals (Sloboda, 1992; Juslin and Västfjäll, 2008; Koelsch, 2010a). Research involving
functional neuroimaging has shown that emotions evoked by music can modulate activity in
virtually all limbic and paralimbic brain structures (Koelsch, 2010b, 2014). Thus, music is
sometimes used as an adjunct therapy in a variety of clinical conditions (Degli Stefani and Biasutti,
2016; Biasutti and Mangiacotti, 2018). Music therapy (MT) is based on the therapeutic aspects of
music. According to the American Music Therapy Association “Music Therapy is an established
health profession in which music is used within a therapeutic relationship to address physical,

and Vamvakousis, 2012). Patterns of EEG activity have been
found to distinguish emotions induced by stimuli with different
valence and arousal levels. Asymmetry patterns in frontal EEG
activity have been found to distinguish between positive and
negative valence, and patterns of overall frontal EEG activity
have been found to identify high and low arousal levels (Schmidt
and Trainor, 2001; Ramirez and Vamvakousis, 2012). Ramirez
et al. (2015) describe an approach to computing in real-time
continuous arousal and valence values from EEG activity: based
on the EEG signal of a person, the arousal level was determined by
computing the ratio of the beta (12–28 Hz) and alpha (8–12 Hz)
brainwaves in the prefrontal cortex, while valence values were
computed by comparing the alpha power activation levels of the
left and right cortical hemispheres.
The aim of the present study is to contribute to the
understanding of the emotional effect (estimated by EEG
information) of MT in the context of palliative care. More
precisely, the study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a
particular MT intervention (a 30-min session including active
and receptive MT techniques) for improving the emotional state
(e.g., stress, anxiety, anger, and depression) of palliative care
patients by analyzing their EEG activity. The patients’ emotional
states were estimated before, during, and after MT sessions
in order to evaluate the general emotional effect of the MT
session, and to assess the emotional effect of particular (active
and receptive) MT techniques. With this aim we randomized
and assigned participants (N = 40) to two groups: the first
experimental group (EG) participated in a MT session, while
the second (control) group was provided with company. We
compared the EEG-based estimated emotional states effect of
MT on participants in the EG with the effects of company
on participants in the control group (CG). To the best of our
knowledge, the present study is the first clinical randomized
controlled trial worldwide to examine the emotional effects of MT
in palliative care using brain activity information.

emotional, cognitive, and social needs of individuals” (American
Music Therapy Association, 2017). MT techniques may be
classified as either active (where patients participate actively in
the process of music creation) or receptive (where patients simply
listen to live or prerecorded music). Techniques normally include
relaxation/imaginative interventions (receptive), therapeutic use
of songs (active or receptive), and various types of improvisation
(active). Verbal interaction with the patients can complement MT
interventions in some cases but is not strictly necessary (Warth
et al., 2014). In general, interventions are personalized according
to the needs of the patient (e.g., according to physical state and
psychosocial needs).
Helping patients in palliative care and their families to
cope effectively with the pain, worries, and emotional impact
inherent in the diagnosis of cancer is a recurrent challenge
for doctors and nurses in palliative units. In this context, MT
may be considered as a candidate for helping to cope and
provide emotional and physical comfort to patients and their
families. Active MT (e.g., interactive live music performances)
delivered by trained music therapists using singing voice and
music instruments can engage patients in ways that receptive
MT (e.g., prerecorded music) cannot (Standley, 1986; Standley
and Hanser, 1995). Studies have found that live music is more
effective than prerecorded music with adult cancer patients, i.e.,
patients over 17 years old (MacGill, 1983). Live MT allows for
personalized interactions which may be particularly important
for patients who relate best to music which is relevant to their
special current situation (Stecher et al., 1972). In clinical palliative
care, where the patient’s medical condition is not likely to be
improved, the objective of MT is often to improve the patient’s
quality of life, e.g., the improvement of pain, stress, and help
to regulate negative emotions, e.g., depression, anxiety, anger
(Planas et al., 2015), as well as to enhance communication (Warth
et al., 2014). MT has been associated with a reduction of anxiety
(Nguyen, 2003; Horne-Thompson and Grocke, 2008) and pain
(Krout, 2001; Lee, 2005; Curtis, 2011; Gutgsell et al., 2013),
in addition to enhancing communication (Brown, 2006) and
spiritual well-being (Wlodarczyk, 2007). Hilliard (2003) reported
a significant improvement of quality of life in terminally ill
patients using MT compared to standard medical care only.
Nakayama et al. (2009) reported a decrease in salivary cortisol
levels after nine participants received a receptive MT session.
Furthermore, MT has been found not only useful for end-oflife patients, but also for family and caregivers (O’Callaghan,
2009). However, current reviews consistently state that there
is a lack of rigorous studies providing quantitative grounds
for recommending or not the use of MT in the context of
palliative care (Korczak et al., 2013; Bradt and Dileo, 2014). The
2010 Cochrane review on MT clinical interventions in palliative
care reported that only five trials had implemented (quasi-)
randomized controlled designs (Bradt and Dileo, 2014).
Recently, the neural correlates of music-evoked emotion have
been investigated by the neuroscientific community using both
functional neuroimaging and Electroencephalography (EEG)
techniques. In particular EEG brain activity information has
been used to detect emotional states in humans (Choppin,
2000; Takahashi, 2004; Bos, 2007; Lin et al., 2010; Ramirez

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
The research reported in this paper is the result of a collaboration
between the Palliative Care Unit (PCU), Oncology Service, Parc
de Salut Mar in Barcelona, and the Universitat Pompeu Fabra,
Barcelona, Spain. Recruitment, interventions, and data collection
are carried out at the PCU. Data processing and analysis was
carried out at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra. All patients were
assessed for eligibility according to predefined inclusion and
exclusion criteria shown in Table 1. Forty adults (13 female and
27 male, mean = 69 years old, SD = 15) with normal hearing,
participated in the study. Twenty of them were randomly selected
to participate in a MT intervention consisting of both active
and receptive techniques. The other twenty participants were
provided with company by the music therapists but no music
was involved in their sessions. Patients were randomly assigned
to the MT group or to the company group by using the method
of randomly permuted blocks. Participants granted their written
consent and the study procedures were positively evaluated by

Materials
Music Material
Prior to the MT session, participants in the EG were interviewed
about their music preferences in order to identify particular
pieces to be included in their MT session. Music included both
instrumental and vocal pieces in a variety of music genres (both
classical and popular music), e.g., Canon de Pachelbel, La Bella
Lola, Rien de rien, Hey Jude, Color Esperanza.

international 10–20 system.

Participants in the EG received a MT session of approximately
30 min. The sessions were conducted by three professional
music therapists with extensive experience in palliative care. Each
MT session consisted of a receptive song, an active song and
a relaxation/imaginative receptive intervention. EEG data was
recorded before the MT session, during the session, and at the
end of the session. Participants in the CG were accompanied by
the same music therapists for approximately 30 min in which
they conversed feely about music and their music preferences.
All participants were receiving similar levels of medication at the
moment of the study. Figure 2 shows a flow diagram of the study
design.
In addition to EEG data, participants self-assessed several
qualitative variables before and after the sessions by completing
the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) pre and
post. ESAS (Bruera et al., 1991; Bruera and Macdonald, 1993;
Chang et al., 2000) is designed to help in the assessment of nine

Data Acquisition and Processing
The Emotiv EPOC EEG system (Emotiv Systems Inc., 2014) was
used for acquiring the patients’ EEG data. It consists of 16 wet
saline electrodes, providing 14 EEG channels, and a wireless
amplifier. The electrodes’ positions were located at AF3, F7, F3,
FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, AF4 according to the
international 10–20 system (see Figure 1). Reference electrodes
were placed at P3 and P4 (just above the subject’s ears). Data were
digitized using the built-in 16-bit ADC with 128 Hz sampling
frequency per channel and sent to the computer via Bluetooth.
The obtained EEG data were filtered using Butterworth 8–12 Hz
and 12–28 Hz filters. The electrode contact impedance to the
scalp was visually monitored using the Emotiv Control Panel
software.
The Emotiv EPOC EEG device is a low-cost EEG device, which
has been mainly marketed as a gaming device. It captures a lower
quality signal compared to the quality of the signal captured by
more expensive equipments. However, recent reports evaluating
the reliability of some low-cost EEG devices, such as the Emotiv
Epoc EEG device, for research purposes suggests that they can
be reliable for measuring EEG signals (Debener et al., 2012; Thie
et al., 2012; Badcock et al., 2013). A usability review of the Emotiv
EPOC EEG device as well as of other low-cost systems can be
found in Badcock et al. (2013). For recording and processing the
data, the OpenViBE platform (Renard et al., 2010) was used.

Methods
Patients eligible for inclusion in the study were contacted at
the Palliative Care Unit (PCU), Oncology Service, Parc de
Salut Mar, and informed about the procedures and objectives
of the study. Patients received no information about which of
the two interventions was the actual experimental condition.
If patients agreed to participate, they were asked to sign the
informed consent form. Participants were treated individually.

common symptoms in patients with cancer. The nine symptoms
considered in ESAS are: pain, tiredness, nausea, depression,
anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, wellbeing, and shortness of breath.
The degree of severity of each symptom is rated in 0–10
numerical scale. For each group (i.e., EG and CG) and each
rated symptom, data were analyzed by applying a t-test of the
differences of pre- and post- values.

activation levels of the two cortical hemispheres and compared
them. Positions F3 and F4 are the most commonly used positions
for looking at this valence related activity, as they are located
in the prefrontal lobe, which plays a central role in emotion
regulation. Valence values were obtained by computing the
difference of alpha power α in channels F4 and F3. More
precisely, valence level was computed as specified by Equation 2,
as following:

EEG Analysis

Valence = αF4 − αF3

The patients’ EEG data was transformed into a coordinate
in Thayer’s arousal-valence emotion plane (Thayer, 1989),
depicted in Figure 3. The EEG data processing was inspired
by Ramirez and Vamvakousis (2012) where it is shown that
the computed arousal and valence values indeed contain
meaningful information about the user’s emotional state. Artifact
detection/elimination was performed by visual inspection of
the signal. EEG data was normalized to avoid inter-participant
variability. Using the EEG signal of a participant, his/her arousal
level was computed as the ratio of the beta (12–28 Hz) and alpha
(8–12 Hz) brainwaves (see Equation 1). EEG data was recorded
in 4 locations on the prefrontal cortex: AF3, AF4, F3, and F4
(see Figure 1). Beta (β) waves have been associated with alert or
excited states of mind, while alpha (α) waves are associated with
relaxed or brain inactivation states of mind. Thus, the β/α ratio
may be considered as an indicator of the arousal state of a person.
More precisely, the instantaneous arousal level of a participant
was computed as specified by Equation 1 below:

RESULTS
Among the symptoms assessed with ESAS, tiredness (p = 0.002),
anxiety (p = 0.002), breathing difficulty (p = 0.042), and
wellbeing (p = 0.036) showed statistical significant differences
(i.e., improvement) between pre and post values in the EG. No
statistically significant differences were found in the pre and post
values of the qualitative indicators in the CG.
Using the EEG data obtained during both the MT sessions
and the company sessions, average valence and arousal values
were computed at the beginning and at the end of the sessions
(Table 2). Average valence values in Table 2 correspond to the
average degree of relative alpha activity in the left frontal lobe,
thus larger values are associated with more positive emotional
states. Average arousal values on the other hand correspond
to either more beta activity or less alpha activity (or both) in
the frontal lobe, and thus larger values represent higher arousal
states. For the EG, the computed average arousal values (standard
deviation) were −0.3 (0.25) and −0.19 (0.18) for the beginning
and end of session, respectively, while the computed average
valence values (standard deviation) were −0.23 (0.16) and 0.08
(0.17) for the beginning and end of the session, respectively.
For the CG, the computed average arousal values were −0.35
(0.25) and −0.24 (0.24) for the beginning and end of the session,
respectively, while the computed average valence values were
−0.16 (0.38) and −0.11 (0.33) for the beginning and end of
session, respectively.
In the EG, both the difference between arousal values
(p = 0.003) and the difference between valence values (p = 0.0004)
at the beginning and the end of the MT sessions were statistically
significant. No significant differences were found in the CG.
Figure 4 shows the correlation within a session between time
and the computed average arousal (orange line) and valence (blue
line) values, for the EG. Periods in time correspond to each of the

Arousal = (βF3 + βF4 + βAF3 + βAF4)/(αF3 + αF4+ (1)
αAF3 + αAF4)
A number of EEG studies (Henriques and Davidson,
1991; Davidson, 1992, 1995, 1998) have shown that the right
hemisphere is more involved in negative emotion while the left
frontal area more associated with positive affect and memories.
Thus, for computing valence states, in this study we computed the

DISCUSSION
Analysis of the qualitative self-reported data showed that 12
out of the 20 participants in the EG reported feeling less
weak after the MT session compared with the beginning
of the session (while none of the other participants in the
group reported increased weakness), confirming the reported
statistically significant difference (p = 0.002) between pre and
post weakness self-reported values. On the other hand, six out
of the 20 participants in the CG reported feeling weaker after
the company session (while only two reported feeling less weak).
Similarly, 11 out of the 20 participants in the EG reported feeling
less anxious, and 12 in a better mood after the MT session
compared to their self-reported values at the beginning of the
session. This is in line with the statistically significant decrease
in anxiety (p = 0.002) and increase in mood (p = 0.036).
Electroencephalography data obtained showed that overall
valence level in the participants in the EG was significantly higher
at the end of the MT session compared to the starting level
(p = 0.0004). This was not the case in the CG where no significant
difference in valence levels was found. This result should be
interpreted as a decrease of relative alpha activity in the left
frontal lobe in the EG participants, which may be interpreted
as an improvement of mood or a lessening of depressive mood
(Henriques and Davidson, 1991; Gotlib et al., 1999; Ramirez
et al., 2015). This reinforces the significant improvement in
self-assessment mood reported by the participants in the EG.
Similarly, arousal values at the beginning and at the end of the MT
session showed a smaller but nevertheless significant difference
(p = 0.003) in the EG, while no difference in arousal values
was found in the CG. The lower p-value for arousal may be
due to the fact that while most of the patients with terminal
cancer are naturally in a low arousal state (e.g., low-mood or
depressed), there may be some patients who feel anxious, i.e.,
are already in a high arousal state. EEG data also showed a
significant improvement in valence in participants in the EG
reflecting a positive change in their initial emotional state. It is
worth noting that while there was a continuous improvement in
the participants’ valence throughout the whole MT session, the
first MT intervention (i.e., the receptive song) alone produced a
significant improvement in valence (p = 0.0019) when compared
to the EG participants’ initial state.
Regarding the relative effects of the different MT techniques
applied during the session (i.e., passive listening, active listening,
and relaxation), relaxation produced significantly lower arousal
levels than active listening in participants in the EG (p = 0.025).
This result was expected given that R is a relaxation technique
used for managing both psychological and physiological agitated
states. Surprisingly, no similar significant differences were found
between relaxation and passive listening. No relative significant
differences in valence were found between passive listening,
active listening and relaxation.
In the EG no significant correlation between arousal values
and time was found. This may be because of differences between
the participants’ states of arousal, as previously mentioned, to the
different MT techniques used in the sessions, or the differences
between participants’ sensitivity to music. Interestingly, the

levels along time. 1 = beginning, 2 = receptive song, 3 = active song,

session sections: beginning, receptive song, active song, receptive
imaginative intervention, and end of session. For arousal the
obtained correlation was r = 0.63 (p = 0.25) while for valence it
was r = 0.89 (p = 0.04).
Figure 5 shows the plot in the arousal/valence plane for the
averaged estimated emotional state of participants in the EG
during the music therapy session: initial state (1), receptive song
(2), active song (3), receptive imaginative intervention (4), and
final state (5).
In order to investigate if there was a correlation between
the participants’ initial and final emotional state, we trained
a (regression) support vector machine (SVM) (Cristianini and
Shawe-Taylor, 2000) with linear kernel to learn a model to
predict the final emotional state of participants given their initial
state. Pearson correlation coefficients of the predicted end-ofsession values with respect to the real end-of-session values were
computed using 10-fold cross validation. For the EG we obtained
r = 0.53 for arousal and r = 0.77 for valence, while for the CG the
obtained correlations were r = −0.15 for arousal and r = 0.13 for
valence.

A Randomized Controlled Trial

correlation between computed valence levels and time within the
MT session was found significant (p = 0.038), which represents
a gradual and constant improvement in the EG participants’
valence emotional state. It has to be noted that time and type
of MT intervention are confounded, thus this result has to be
investigated further in order to establish if it is due to the natural
progression of the MT session or to the particular sequence of
interventions.
Considering the observed improvements in valence levels
in one MT session and the limited duration of each session
(i.e., approximately 30 min), it seems possible that further
improvement in valence levels may have been obtained if sessions
had been longer and/or if treatment had consisted of more
sessions. Unfortunately, due to the very short life-span (2 weeks
on average) of the participants in the study it was impossible to
program more than one MT session per participant. In the past,
only a few studies in the literature have investigated the long-term
effect of MT. In the current study, no follow-up of the participants
in order to examine the long-term effect of MT was possible.
We plan to investigate this issue further, perhaps considering a
different group of patients.
The question of personalization in MT is an important one
but nevertheless it has been little investigated. In this context,
we asked ourselves if the emotional state of the participants
at the end of the session was related to their emotional state
at the beginning of the session. In order to investigate this
issue, machine learning techniques were applied to obtain a
computational model to predict the participants’ emotional state
at the end of the session given their initial emotional state.
The accuracy of the obtained models (r = 0.53 for arousal and
r = 0.77 for valence in the EG, and r = −0.15 for arousal
and r = 0.13 for valence in the CG), indicate that there is
a moderate/strong relationship between the initial and final
arousal/valence states of participants in the EG, while there is
no such relationship in the CG. Interestingly, in the context
of this study, we showed that it is possible to predict with
some degree of accuracy the final emotional state of a person
after the MT session based on his/her initial emotional state.

This is, using the EEG data of the participants in the study
it is possible to extract patterns which allow us to predict the
emotional outcome (in particular valence) of new participants
after the MT intervention described in this paper. This could
open the possibility for personalized MT interventions based on
the patient’s state at the beginning of the session. We plan to
investigate this further, specifically by adding extra information
about the patients (e.g., physiological variables) for training the
predictive models.
The results obtained in this study seem to indicate that MT
techniques (both active and receptive) can be useful tools for
modulating the emotional state of end-of-life patients. Helping
such patients to modulate their emotions may improve their
quality of life by helping them to cope with the emotional
effects inherent in their condition. Although the present study
is limited in scope due to the use of only one MT session per
participant, it provides an evidence-based rationale for MT in
palliative care based on methods involving brain activity (EEG)
data. Furthermore, the results obtained open the possibility for
personalized MT interventions based on patients’ emotional state
before MT is applied.
