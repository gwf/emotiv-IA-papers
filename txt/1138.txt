Background: Neurofeedback (NFB) is a neuromodulatory technique that enables
voluntary modulation of brain activity in order to treat neurological condition, such
as central neuropathic pain (CNP). A distinctive feature of this technique is that it
actively involves participants in the therapy. In this feasibility study, we present results
of participant self-managed NFB treatment of CNP.
Methods: Fifteen chronic spinal cord injured (SCI) participants (13M, 2F), with chronic
CNP equal or greater than 4 on the Visual Numeric Scale, took part in the study. After
initial training in hospital (up to 4 sessions), they practiced NF at home, on average
2–3 times a week, over a period of several weeks (min 4, max 20). The NFB protocol
consisted of upregulating the alpha (9–12 Hz) and downregulating the theta (4–8 Hz)
and the higher beta band (20–30 Hz) power from electrode location C4, for 30 min. The
output measures were pain before and after NFB, EEG before and during NFB and pain
questionnaires. We analyzed EEG results and show NFB strategies based on the Power
Spectrum Density of each single participant.
Results: Twelve participants achieved statistically significant reduction in pain and
in eight participants this reduction was clinically significant (larger than 30%). The
most successfully regulated frequency band during NFB was alpha. However, most
participants upregulated their individual alpha band, that had an average dominant
frequency at αp = 7.6 ± 0.8 Hz (median 8 Hz) that is lower than the average of the
general population, which is around 10 Hz. Ten out of fifteen participants significantly
upregulated their individual alpha power (αp ± 2 Hz) as compared to 4 participants
who upregulated the power in the fixed alpha band (8–12 Hz). Eight out of the twelve
participants who achieved a significant reduction of pain, significantly upregulated their
individual alpha band power. There was a significantly larger increase in alpha power
(p < 0.0001) and decrease of theta power (p < 0.04) in participant specific rather than
in fixed frequency bands.

Conclusion: Neurofeedback is a neuromodulatory technique that gives participants
control over their pain and can be self-administered at home. Regulation of individual
frequency band was related to a significant reduction in pain.

reduction in pain. Typically, tCDS electrodes are applied
over the motor cortex while rTMS is applied either over
the pre-frontal or central area. It is believed that while both
techniques target the central motor area, they indirectly
influence cortical areas involved in the pain matrix. For this
reason, stimulation sites do not necessarily correspond to the
somatotopic location of the part of the body that is perceived as
being painful.
Neurofeedback is a neuromodulatory intervention which does
not require an external electrical or magnetic filed. It is a
type of a biofeedback where users are provided with real time
information about their brain activity in a form of a visual, audio
or even haptic feedback. Neurofeedback allows users to develop
a voluntary control over an unconscious physiological process
using a feedback signal (Sherlin et al., 2011; Ros et al., 2014). Thus
it enables the implicit control of covert brain activity that may
have no direct behavioral correlates.
Neurofeedback has been used for decades to treat various
disorders, most successfully attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder and epilepsy (Demos, 2005). Development of
inexpensive Brain Computer Interface technology contributed to
its recent popularity not only for the treatment of neurological
conditions but also for the improvement of peak performance in
the able bodied people (Gruzelier, 2014). NFB has been used for
treatments of various types of pain including complex regional
pain syndrome (Jensen et al., 2007) fibromyalgia (Kayiran et al.,
2010; Caro and Winter, 2011), trigemina neuralgia (Sime, 2004),
cancer pain (Hetkamp et al., 2019), migraine (Siniatchkin et al.,
2000), and CNP (Jensen et al., 2013a; Hassan et al., 2015).
The advantage of NFB over other neurostimulation techniques
is that it enables the participants to take the active part in therapy,
changing the locus of control from the external to the internal
(Wood and Kober, 2018). People who use NFB for a prolonged
period of time can learn to apply the technique at will without a
feedback (Sherlin et al., 2011). Furthermore the technique is less
costly than rTMS and is also potentially safer than rTMS, tDCS,
and CES. From a research perspective, NFB has an additional
advantage over neurostimulation techniques, it records brain
activity thus providing direct evidence of neuromodulation
during the therapy.
Neurofeedback is often based on operant conditioning, a
strategy that increases a preferred behavior and decreases an
undesired behavior providing a reward or punishment (Skinner,
1948). The idea behind this is to train a user to promote a
desirable response to occur again under the same conditions
(Sherlin et al., 2011). Typically in NFB a “reward” and a “penalty”
are presented in a visual form, e.g., changes in the color or size of
an object on a computer screen. Simple, frequently used forms of
reward and penalty are changes in color (i.e., reward corresponds

INTRODUCTION
Neuropathic pain is a chronic condition caused by damage to
or disease of the somatosensory nervous system (Haanpää et al.,
2011), affecting 7–10% of the general population (Colloca et al.,
2017). Although the cause of pain is in the nervous system, it
is typically perceived as burning or stinging sensation coming
from the body (Siddall et al., 2003). Neuropathic pain may be
of a peripheral (i.e., post operative, cancer, and painful diabetic
neuropathy) or of a central origin (Seifert and Maihöfner, 2009).
Central neuropathic pain (CNP) is caused by an injury to the
central nervous system including the brain and the spinal cord,
and it has a high prevalence in conditions such a spinal cord
injury (SCI) (Siddall et al., 2003; Finnerup, 2013), multiple
sclerosis (Osterberg et al., 2005), stroke (Andersen et al., 1995)
and Parkinson’s disease (Beiske et al., 2009).
In people with SCI, the prevalence of neuropathic pain is
around 50% and it typically occurs within the first year of injury
(Siddall et al., 2003). Severe CNP results in reduced quality of life
(Middleton et al., 2007) due to its impact on sleep and anxiety
(Siddall et al., 2003; Finnerup, 2013) and in more extreme cases
also affects employability (Mann et al., 2013).
There are six main mechanisms involved in the chronification
of neuropathic pain: (i) activity increase in areas of the pain
neuromatrix, (ii) recruitment of additional cortical areas beyond
the classical pain neuromatrix, (iii) cortical reorganization and
maladaptive neuroplasticity, (iv) alterations in neurochemistry,
(v) structural brain changes, and (vi) disruption of the brain
default mode network (Seifert and Maihöfner, 2009).
Central neuropathic pain is typically treated with medications,
such as antidepressant, anticonvulsants and opioids (Dickenson
and Ghandehari, 2007). These medications have multiple side
effects, such as drowsiness, nausea, constipation and dry mouth
(Bakonja and Rowbotham, 2006) and some of them lead to
misuse or even drug-related deaths (Gov.UK, 2019). In addition
to having side effects, medications have a limited efficacy
(Finnerup et al., 2018). For example, about half the people
taking gabapentin experience a moderate reduction in pain (30%)
(Wiffen et al., 2017).
Neuromodulatory treatment of CNP typically rely on
external electrical or magnetic stimulation such as repetitive
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), transcranial Direct
Current Stimulation (tDCS), and Cranial Electrotherapy
Stimulation (CES) (O’Connell et al., 2018). A recent Cohrane
review showed that rTMS on average results in 12%, while
tDCS results in 17% short term relief in pain. There was
no evidence of CES effectiveness. O’Connell et al. (2018)
suggested 15% as a clinically relevant reduction in pain,
meaning that only tDCS may result in a clinically significant

EEG Correlates of NFB for CNP

A discrepancy with respect to alpha band power in different
studies may be partially explained by the way alpha band power
was calculated, as in people with CNP peak activity is lower.
Thus standard 8–12 Hz band might not reflect the individual
alpha band power.
In our recent study we showed that a reduced alpha power and
a reduced dominant alpha frequency are predictive asymptomatic
markers of CNP in people with SCI (Vuckovic et al., 2018b).
These markers appear before pain and are representative features
for machine learning systems that can predict the risk of
developing pain (Vuckovic et al., 2018a). This indicates that alpha
activity may be the most relevant feature for a NFB protocol.
The NFB protocols for treatment of different types of chronic
pain show that most protocols target the central or temporal
cortex, upregulating alpha (8–12 Hz) or lower beta (12–15 Hz)
activity and downregulating theta (4–8 Hz) and higher beta (20–
30 Hz) (Kayiran et al., 2010; Caro and Winter, 2011; Jensen et al.,
2013a; Hassan et al., 2015). All protocols were based on fixed
frequency bands.
In our previous study we tested protocols that increased
the alpha (9–12 Hz) and decreased the theta and higher beta
band over the primary motor cortex (C3 and C4) (Hassan
et al., 2015). Four out of five participants who received 20 to
40 sessions reported a more than 30% reduction in pain. The
effect was notable up to 1 month following the last session. We
also demonstrated that all participants were able to modulate
their brain activity in the direction of NFB even without the
feedback. On the contrary, with pre-recorded sham feedback
provided they were not able to modulate their brain activity.
Finally we showed that a week following the last session, their
event related desynchronisation over the sensory-motor cortex
during imagined movement was reduced, indicating reduced
over activity of the motor cortex (Hasan et al., 2016). Their
baseline EEG was also reduced in a wider pain matrix including
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex
and the insular cortex, in the higher beta band.
In this participant self-managed study, we asked participants
with long standing CNP and SCI to practice NFB on their own
and monitored their pain level and EEG activity. The advantage
of self-managed NFB is that users can decide when to use the
NFB, thus potentially maximizing the effect of treatment.
Research questions that we are trying to answer in this
paper are:

to green color while penalty corresponds to red color) or size of
on object on a computer screen.
It is believed that NFB tunes brain oscillations toward a
homeostatic set-point which affords an optimal balance between
network flexibility and stability (i.e., self-organizing criticality)
(Ros et al., 2014). It is believed that non-degenerative brain
disorders may have a self-tuning impairment, having their
dynamic repertoire “trapped” in an abnormal resting state (Ros
et al., 2014). In this respect, chronic pain disrupts “a default
mode network” (Baliki et al., 2008). NFB facilitates global brain
connectivity and establishes a normalized default mode network.
In order to establish a NFB protocol for CNP it was necessary
to identify how CNP affects brain oscillatory activity, as measured
by EEG. An important factor influencing oscillatory EEG activity
is thalamo-cortical dysrhythmia, that serves as a trigger for
cortical dysfunction (Llinas et al., 1999; Walton and Llinas, 2010).
Thalamo-cortical dysrhythmia is caused by either deafferentation
or disinhibition of thalamic nuclei and as such may have a
subcortical or supracortical origin such as neuropathic pain,
tinnitus, Parkinson’s disease and depression (Llinas et al., 1999).
In case of CNP caused by SCI, a lesion to the spinal cord causes
deafferentation of thalamic nuclei leading to hyperpolarization of
these cells. When hyperpolarized, thalamic neurons change from
high threshold tonic firing to low threshold theta range oscillatory
burst. Such low frequency oscillations entrain corticothalamic
loops generating increased coherence between the thalamus and
the cortex, and increased power in 4–8 Hz range in the cortical
level, also accompanies by the reduction of the dominant (alpha)
frequency (Llinas et al., 1999). At the same time thalamocortical
modules in theta mode exert less collateral inhibition to the
neighboring modules, which are thereby activated in higher beta
and gamma frequency ranges (Llinas et al., 1999; Sarnthein
et al., 2006). This abnormal high frequency firing is proposed to
generate the positive symptoms of pain and allodynia (Schulman
et al., 2005). In people with CNP, increased theta band activity
is considered the main signature of CNP (Sarnthein et al., 2006;
Stern et al., 2006; Boord et al., 2008; Vuckovic et al., 2014).
Previous EEG studies on CNP in SCI also reported a shift
in the dominant alpha frequency toward lower values and a
reduced reactivity (reduction of EEG power) to eyes opening,
attributed to the altered input from the thalamus (Boord et al.,
2008; Jensen et al., 2013b; Vuckovic et al., 2014). Changes in
the resting state alpha band power are reported in some studies
to be increased (Vuckovic et al., 2014) while others reported
decreased alpha band power compared with participants with no
pain (Jensen et al., 2013b). Our group also found an increased
level of desynchronisation during imagined movements of
both painful and non-painful limbs (Vuckovic et al., 2014),
supporting results from fMRI studies indicating the over-activity
of the sensory-motor cortex due to CNP (Wrigley et al., 2009;
Gustin et al., 2010).
A recent review of EEG patterns in chronic pain found that the
increased theta and alpha activity at rest and decreased amplitude
of evoked potentials to sensory stimulation and cognitive tasks
are the main indices of chronic pain (Pinheiro et al., 2016). On
the contrary, Camfferman et al. (2017) suggested that the reduced
alpha band power is an indicator of chronic pain in general.

Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Classification was used
to determine the neurological level of SCI (Kirshblum et al.,
2011), and the completeness of injury. The level of injury C
(cervical) corresponds to tetraplegia while T (thoracic), and L
(lumbar) to paraplegia. The completeness of injury is defined as:
A-sensory and motor complete, B-sensory incomplete and motor
complete and C and D-sensory and motor incomplete. Eight
participants were able to walk, nine were fulltime wheelchair
users who had good hand function and three participants were
tetraplegic with poor hand function. Tetraplegics were assisted
by their caregivers with NFB setup.
There were no inclusion restrictions with respect to the level
or completeness of the injury, as there is no clear evidence
of correlation between these factors and the incidence of CNP
(Siddall et al., 2003). Table 1 shows participants’ demographic
information. The inclusion criteria were: intensity of CNP ≥ 4
on a Visual Numerical Scale (VNS, 0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain
imaginable), CNP ongoing for at least 6 months (chronic), aged
between 18 and 75 years, no self-reported history of brain disease
or injury, and basic computer skills. The exclusion criteria were:
presence of chronic or acute muscular or visceral pain ≥ 4 VNS,
traumatic brain injury, stroke, epilepsy, or any other self-reported
neurological problem.
All participants had below level pain while participants 3,
8, and 12 also had pain at the level of injury. The location of
the painful region was marked by participants on a body chart
(Figure 1). At level pain may occur due to injury to the roots or
spinal cord, thus it may have central or peripheral origin. Below

level pain is more common and more persistent; it has a central
origin and is caused by the injury to the spinal cord (Bryce et al.,
2012; Finnerup et al., 2014). Participants typically described the
pain sensation as pins and needles, constant burning or freezing,
tingling or squeezing combined with the intermittent electrical
shock sensations.
Most of the participants were prescribed CNP medications,
such as antidepressants or anticonvulsants. They were asked
not to change their medications throughout the study to avoid
their interference with the NFB effect on pain. Six patients
previously tried non-pharmacological treatments (acupuncture
and mindfulness) that were available through the National
Healthcare Service, but have not been receiving any nonpharmacological treatment for at least 6 months prior to taking
part in the study. During a regular check-up communication,
approximately once a fortnight (in person, email, or Skype)
there were asked if there were any changes dosage or type of

study. All participants were also asked to fill out an electronic
pain diary before and after training. The intensity of pain was
recorded using the VNS ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst
pain imaginable) in integer values. EEG was recorded during NFB
sessions from the training electrode. At the end of the training,
semi-structured interviews were organized. The results of the
interviews with participants will be analyzed in a usability study
presented elsewhere.
Because Epoch was not initially designed to record from the
central cortex, participants were trained to place the headset on
the correct central location, so that the recording electrode was
placed approximately in between C2 and C4. The Epoch headset
is only available in one size it was therefore not possible to provide
a more precise location. Figure 2A shows an example of correct
placing of the headset with location for the electrode from which
training was provided.

shown in Figure 2 provided written informed consent. The study
has been approved by the Greater Glasgow and Clyde National
Health Service Ethical Committee. This study is a registered
clinical trial NCT02678494.

The Experimental Protocol
Initial Assessment
At the beginning of the study, all participants were asked to fill
out a “Brief Pain Inventory” (Tan et al., 2004) and a “Neuropathic
Pain Symptom Inventory” (Bouhassira et al., 2004). Participant’s
initial response to NFB was measured using a laboratory device
usbamp (Guger Technology, Austria), as in our previous study
(Hassan et al., 2015; Hasan et al., 2016). This devices uses an EEG
cap and can therefore precisely define the electrode locations.
This is how the location of electrodes for the wearable EEG
headset (Epoch, Emotiv, United States) was determined. Based
on the literature (Jensen et al., 2013a) and our initial assessment
of NFB on able-bodied people (Al-Taleb, 2018), we organized up
to four initial assessment sessions in hospital. We were looking
for early sensory responses to NFB such as: reduction in pain
of at least one point on the VNS, a pleasant warmth replacing
the sensation of burning or freezing, tingling in the toes or
finger tips (Hassan et al., 2015). Five out of twenty participants
decided to withdraw before completing all four NFB sessions,
three could not commit to the study and two were lacking any
response to NFB.

System Description and Neurofeedback Training
Protocol
NFB training was provided approximately from the electrode
location C4 (American Clinical Neurophysiology Society
[ACNS], 2006), placed over the primary motor cortex of the
left arm and hand. The sampling frequency was 128 samples/s
and two reference electrodes were placed parietaly, above the
ears for CMS/DRL noise cancelation. The impedance was set
under 10 k using Epoch proprietary software. A wireless
communication between the EEG device and tablet, was based
on proprietary 2.4 GB wireless technology.
Custom made software written in C++ (Al-Taleb, 2018)
consisted of a unit for EEG recording and analysis and a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). The GUI had the main screen
for neurofeedback training, a screen for EEG parameters setting,
and an electronic pain diary.
Neurofeedback sessions always started with 2 min baseline
recording. During the baseline recording, participants sat still
with their eyes open looking at the center of the screen. NFB
training sessions were 5 min long and participants were advised
to have 5–6 daily sessions.

Participant Training to Use a Wearable BCI
The remaining fifteen participants and caregivers were trained to
use the Epoch EEG (Emotiv, United States) device and custom
made software. They were offered up to 4 training sessions
before taking the EEG device and tablet with software home to
train on their own. To minimize the number of hospital visits,
some of the training sessions took place on the same day as
the assessment with the usbamp. Participants were instructed
to practice the NFB on demand but at least once a week for
a period of 2 months; some participants decided to keep the
system after 2 months, we followed them up till the end of the

EEG Correlates of NFB for CNP

A training protocol was adopted from the previous study by
our group (Hassan et al., 2015). During NFB training the power
of the EEG signal was calculated over a 0.5 s sliding window.
EEG signal was filtered in four frequency bands: wideband 2–
30 Hz, 2 theta (4–8 Hz), α alpha (9–12 Hz), and higher β beta
(20–30 Hz) using a 5th order Butterworth filter. The relative
power was calculated as a power in a selected band divided by
wide band 2–30 Hz power. Relative power was presented to users
during NFB (range from 0 to 1, corresponding to 0 to 100% of the
wide band power).
The values of relative theta, alpha and beta power were
shown on a computer screen, in a form of three separate bars
(Figure 2B). During NFB training, participants were aiming
at increasing the alpha band power and decreasing the theta
and beta band power, relative to the baseline power recorded
on the same day prior to NFB. A slightly higher alpha range
starting from 9 rather than 8 Hz was selected in order to
shift the dominant frequency toward the higher values, as a
lower dominant alpha frequency was found to be a signature
of CNP (Boord et al., 2008). While the theta and beta bands
were related to EEG signatures of pain, these two bands are also
related to noise coming from blinking (theta band) and muscle
activity (beta band). Thus minimizing theta and beta power also
minimized the online noise.
The training threshold was fixed and set to 110% of the
baseline alpha power and to 90% of the baseline theta and higher
beta power. A color of the representative bar was green when
the alpha power was above the threshold and was red otherwise.
For the theta and beta power the color of the representative
bars was green when the power was under the threshold and
red otherwise. The bars also changed size proportional to the
amplitude of the power.

Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated between the
intensity of pain and EEG features as well as between pain and
patient demographic data. A significance level of p = 0.05 was
adopted in all cases.

RESULTS
Participants Compliance With the Study
Out of fifteen participants who took part in the NFB study, seven
used the system for 2 months as required. Three out of these
seven continued to use the system for additional 6 weeks. Eight
participants discontinued the study for the following reasons:
unrelated health problems (N = 3), new caregiver (N = 1),
moving home (N = 1), too long donning time (>15 min)
(N = 2), broken device (N = 1). Out of seven participants
who used the system in their home for 8 weeks or longer, five
could walk, one was a sensory and motor complete paraplegic,
and one sensory and motor complete tetraplegic. EEG data
and pain diaries were collected from all fifteen participants
(participants could not start NFB or exit the software application
unless filling out the pain diary). Table 2 shows the number of
session, frequency of use and the total duration of the study
for each participant. Participants were advised to use NFB on
demand, when they had time and when they felt most pain.
From the frequency of use, which in most participants was
about three times per week, it can be concluded that NFB had
an effect that lasted several days. This is, however, only an
estimate, because participants did not fill out the pain diary
on a daily basis and at the same time of the day (participants
often reported that pain tends to be higher in the evening than
in the morning).

We analyzed the average ability of each participant to upregulate
the alpha and to down regulate the theta and beta band power.
Figure 3 shows the average (mean ± SD) modulation of power,
with respect to the baseline power in fixed frequency ranges
(theta, alpha, and higher beta) for each participant. Positive
values correspond to the upregulation (increase) while negative
values correspond to the downregulation (decrease). A dashed
line represents 10% change with respect to the baseline ( ± 10%
was also set as a training threshold). In addition, a statistical
analysis was performed over all training sessions, to assess
whether NFB consistently modulated EEG power in a desired
direction (increase of the alpha and decrease for the theta and
beta bands). This was a somewhat conservative approach as it also
included early sessions while participants were still learning the
NFB technique. Only three participants significantly upregulated
their alpha band power, but nine participants significantly
downregulated either theta or beta band power.
Figure 4 shows the average (mean ± SD) modulation of
power, with respect to the baseline power in participant specific
frequency ranges for each participant. Twelve out of fifteen
participants increased on average the alpha power for more
than 10% and for nine of them this was statistically significant.
Ten reduced their theta band power by more than 10% while

EEG was visually inspected and signal having an amplitude
greater than 100 µV or containing electrooculogram EOG
(blinking and eye rolling) was manually removed. On average
10–20% of the signal was removed.

Power spectrum density
PSD was calculated using Hamming windows over 4 s long
recording overlapping for 2 s and averaging PSD over all windows
(Welch periodogram method). A logarithmic PSD was calculated
as 10 log10 PSD for visualization purposes.
Power was calculated for (4–8 Hz), (8–12 Hz), and (20–30 Hz)
and for individual frequency bands by summing up PSD values
over the selected frequency range. In order to determine the
individual bands, the frequency of alpha peak αp was determined
first as a maximum of PSD graph and a band power was
calculated with respect to that peak. The individual alpha band
was defined as (αp ± 2 Hz), the individual theta band as (αp −6 Hz
to αp −2 Hz) and the individual higher beta band as (αp +12 Hz
to αp +22 Hz).

and participant specific ranges. For the beta bands this difference
was not statistically significant (p < 0.08).
To further illustrate why it was necessary to calculate the
alpha band power in a participant specific manner, we show
a representative example of power spectrum density for each
participant during the baseline period and during NFB in
Figure 5. Participants average dominant alpha peak is shown in
Table 3. All but one participant had a dominant alpha peak 8 Hz
or lower, as opposed to the general population where it is about
10 Hz (Niedermeyer, 1999). The dominant peak did not change
as a result of NFB.
Figure 5 shows that during NFB participants did not shift
their alpha peak in the 9–12 Hz range but increased the power
in their own alpha range (see, e.g., P3, P4, P7, andP17). Six
participants downregulated their beta band activity (desired
direction) while four were increased their beta band activity
(undesired direction). The individual theta band in most cases
actually overlapped with the delta (1–4 Hz) band while individual
alpha band partially overlapped with the theta (4–8 Hz) band.
Furthermore in five participants (P5, P7, P11, P16, and P17)
the dominant peak was barely visible in the relaxed state but
emerged during NFB.
The alpha band power normally increases when a person
closes their eyes. Engagement in a cognitive task normally
results in decrease in alpha and increase in beta band activity
(Niedermeyer, 1999). In addition to the wide spread alpha
activity, the central cortex is also a source of the sensory motor
rhythm, also present at 8–12 Hz (Niedermeyer, 1999). The
idea behind NFB from electrode location C4 was to modulate
the sensory-motor rhythm. This rhythm drops upon motor

action, and there is no known verbalized strategy to increase
it with the eyes opened. For this reason we believe that the
increase in alpha (i.e., sensory motor rhythm) activity in this

case is due to NFB and not due to general engagement in
a cognitive task.

The Effect of NFB on Pain
Table 4 shows the average level of pain reduction following
NFB treatment for each participant. Because the VNS pain
ratings are not normally distributed (e.g., the initial pain
level in all participants was between 4 and 10) we present
them as median and first and third quartile and related
statistical results based on non-parametric statistical analysis.
We, however, also present the same results as mean ± SD
in the Appendix, similar to how results are presented in
most pain related publications. Both approaches provide
similar results.
Twelve out of fifteen participants achieved statistically
significant reduction in pain. In eight participants this was also
clinically significant (larger than 30%). Thirty percent was based
on studies reporting on the effectiveness of pharmacological
treatments (Wiffen et al., 2017). If we adopt 15% as a
clinically significant value, as in papers reporting on benefit of
neurostimulation technology (O’Connell et al., 2018), thirteen
participants achieved a clinically significant reduction in pain.
There was no direct correlation between the increase in alpha
band power during NFB and decrease in pain (p = 0.4589,
R = −0.0152). This is, however, not surprising bearing in mind
that the NFB tunes the brain toward a homeostatic set point, that

might not be a state with a maximum alpha band power. Baseline
preNFB alpha power varies due to the circadian rhythm and was
not possible to assess because participants did not necessarily
always practice NFB at the same time of the day.
We analyzed how the baseline pain intensity changes over
time. There was not a clear trend of Pre NFB pain level decrease,
though in some patients relief of pain during NFB was almost
compete (Figures 6B,C). This could be attributed to a fact that
participants did not practice NFB at regular intervals but only
when their pain level increased to the point that they needed pain
relief. With that respect some participants consistently practiced
NFB when their pain would reach the same level and achied
about the same pain relief (Figure 6A) while in the others the
pre and post NFB pain level varied, frequently reaching very low
level (Figures 6B,C).

We showed that eight participants who significantly increased
their alpha power also achieved a significant reduction in pain
(P3, P4, P5, P7, P10, P12, P14, and P17), while four who did
not achieve a significant increase in alpha power also achieved
a significant reduction of pain (P1, P2, P16, and P19). However,
three of these four had a significant reduction in beta or both
theta and beta band power.
Furthermore two participants who achieved a significant
increase in the alpha band power did not achieve a
significant reduction of pain. One of these (P11) achieved
a significant reduction in the beta band power while
the other (P20) achieved a significant increase in beta
power. Finally one participant who did not significantly
increase the alpha band power did not significantly reduce
pain (P18), this participant significantly reduced the
theta band power.

A Relationship Between the Modulation
of EEG Activity and the Intensity of Pain
We analyzed the relationship between a significant reduction in
pain and a significant upregulation of the alpha power. There
were four possible scenarios

(a) Participants significantly increased their individual
alpha power and achieved a statistically significant
reduction in pain.

but did achieve a statistically significant reduction in pain.

Our analysis confirmed results from the literature regarding
the weak relationship between the intensity of pain and the
participants’ demographic data (Siddall et al., 2003). Spearman
non- parametric rank sum test was applied. There was no
significant correlation between the level of pain and the level
of injury (p = 0.6949, r = 0.0935). The level of pain was
not significantly correlated with the time since injury though

level of pain between walkers (ASIA D) and non-walkers

There was no clear correlation between the duration of the
study in weeks and the reduction of pain (p = 0.796, R = 0.094)
and the total number of NFB sessions and reduction of pain
(p = 0.299, R = 0.287). This may indicate that NFB may
contribute to reduction in pain to a certain level, but that further
implementation may only keep this pain level. It also has to
be acknowledged that not every NFB session is successful as it
depends on the participant’s mental state (Demos, 2005).

DISCUSSION
With the advent of wearable consumer grade wearable EEG
headsets, this technology become available to individual users.
Thus neurofeedback becomes competitive with direct current
stimulation technique, which has also been used for pain
reduction, and can be purchased over the Internet. This
prompted us to organize this feasibility participant self-managed
NFB study. We demonstrate that after up to 4 training sessions at
hospital, people naïve to EEG technology could learn how to use
NFB on their own at home, reporting reduction in pain.
The most significant result of this study is the evidence
that NFB is based on upregulation of participant specific
rather than fixed frequency bands, which are lower than
in healthy individuals. We show PSD modulation for each
single participant, advancing our understanding of variation in
neuromodulation strategies. Our previous study in a controlled
hospital environment indicated a relationship between NFB and
changes in pain related areas of the cortex (Hassan et al., 2015;
Hasan et al., 2016). The NFB protocol, however, had three
parameters and the number of participants was too small to
establish which of these are most relevant for the reduction
in pain. In this study we showed that nine out of fifteen
participants achieved a significant modulation of their individual
alpha band and that eight of those who achieved significant
modulation of the alpha band also achieved a statistically
significant reduction in pain. A study by Sarnthein et al.
(2006) showed that patients who underwent central lateral
thalamoctomy experienced immediate relief of CNP while their
alpha peak frequency remained low 3 months post-surgery.
Only 12 month post-surgery the frequency of the dominant
alpha peak shifted toward higher frequencies (Sarnthein et al.,
2006). Schulman et al. (2005) also showed that the dominant
alpha peak shifted toward higher frequencies (energy in 9–
11 Hz band increased) only in patients who reported 50%
reduction of pain as a result of spinal cord stimulation.
They did not report how long patients were pain free. Our
study lasted on average under 3 months, so it is possible
that prolonged NFB practice would result in alpha peak shift,
under assumption that NFB would cause long term top down
thalamic depolarization.
Although theta and beta band have clear relation to thalamocortical dysrhythmia, their relation to the reduction in pain
through NFB was less clear than for the alpha band. One
of the reasons might be that the bar representing the alpha
power was placed in the middle of the GUI and was largest so
participants might have perceived it as the most relevant. The
other reason might be that the theta and beta bands overlap with
eye movement artifact and muscular activity frequency range and
could be reduced by minimizing these artifacts. A commercially
available NFB software (e.g., NeXus, MindMedia) typically
observe one frequency band and monitors the theta and higher
beta band as a means of reducing eye movement and muscular
artifacts rather than a proper NFB training. They typically present
the central (e.g., 8–12 Hz, 12–15 Hz) band with the largest bar as
it reliably presents EEG activity without the artifacts and is most
relevant for the NFB protocol. On the other hand, minimizing the

Incidental Findings and Side Effects
Similar to our previous study, most participants reported a
tingling sensations staring in their toes, or in case of tetraplegics
also at the tip of their fingers. One participant that initially
had CNP in the form of an excessive cold sensation, reported
a sensation of pleasant warmth during NFB; the sensation
of a pleasant warmth was also reported by the majority of
participants whose pain was experienced as a burning sensation.
Three participants reported successful transfer learning, i.e.,
applying NFB mental strategy without a device (it is possible that
more participants had this ability but we did not systematically
explored it). One participant said that wearing an audio headset at
work produced similar sensation on his head which additionally
helped him to imagine doing NFB. Transfer learning is an
inherent property of successful NFB independent on a specific
application (Sherlin et al., 2011) that might affected regularity of
NFB practice with the device. It may be considered as the main
advantage of NFB over tDCS or rTCS because it allows a person
to apply a NFB strategy even without a device. Experience from
other NFB studies (Sherlin et al., 2011), however, show that using
NFB device at least once a week is necessary in order to keep the
transfer learning ability.
Two participants with limited walking ability due to clonic
spasm were spasm free immediately after 20–30 min of training,
demonstrated in our laboratory. The spasm subsided for the
rest of the day following NFB. Another participants who could
walk with poor prioprioception reported returned sensation
in his foot sole to the extent that he could feel whether the
surface on which he walked was slippery or rough. He also
demonstrated that, due to improved proprioception, he could
stand still with his eyes closed, that is a challenging task for
people with poor proprioception. Participants also occasionally
mentioned improved sleep but it was hard to determine whether
it was primarily a better nights sleep or better sleep quality due
to reduced pain.
Negative side effects were occasional headaches, but it was
unclear whether this was due to increased concentration or due
to the NFB protocol. Another negative side effect was occasional
hypersensitivity in the soles of the feet in the participant who
regained proprioception, this was managed by reducing the
duration of NFB.
We did not systematically examine participants’ mental
strategy but on their check-up visit we asked what were they
thinking of during NFB. They all mentioned evoking some happy
episodic memory, such as thinking of a favorite activity, an
episode with a favorite family member or a favorite holiday (e.g.,
imaging laying on a beach). This might be an indication that they
activated default mode network (Sestieri et al., 2011).

EEG Correlates of NFB for CNP

We could only show that 2/3 of people who actively regulated
their alpha brain waves also achieved a significant reduction in
pain. On the other hand, due to “transfer learning,” i.e., the ability
to reduce pain by brining themselves into “neurofeedback” state
even without using the device it would be hard to test for placebo
in people who are experienced in NFB.
Although NFB is a popular technique for the treatment of
various neurological problems, there are few published pain
related randomized controlled NFB studies. A randomized
controlled studies for the treatment of fibromyalgia, suggested a
protocol that upregulated the 12–15 Hz band and downregulated
the theta and higher beta (22–30 Hz) band from Cz (Caro and
Winter, 2011). Similar to our study they selected the motor cortex
and had a most relevant frequency band to upregulate and two
additional to downregulate. They reported a reduction in pain
of 39% but did not provide any EEG evidence that participants
successfully modulated their brain waves. Kayiran et al. (2010)
performed a randomized control trial to compare the efficacy
of NFB with the efficacy of medication for the treatment of
fibromyalgia, using a similar protocol as Caro and Winter (2011).
They claimed that NFB that increases a 12–15 Hz band power
appears to facilitate a thalamic inhibitory mechanisms. They
reported that the NFB group achieved larger benefits than the
control group in terms of reduction in pain and other parameters
related to sleep, depression and quality of life. They provided
results averaged over all 18 participants about changes in the
theta, alpha and beta power over different weeks. The only group
who looked at the effectiveness of NFB for the treatment of CNP
tested three different protocols (none being the same as ours)
over four NFB sessions each and found modest, clinically nonsignificant reduction in pain (Jensen et al., 2013a). The protocols
were based on increasing alpha or 10–15 Hz while decreasing
beta or theta and beta bands from several different locations.
They reported that this effect persisted at 3 months follow up.
However, they later suggested that NFB may be a useful technique
to enhance the effect of hypnotic analgesia (Jensen et al., 2016).
Motor imagery (MI) is a self-induced neuromodulation
technique based on a verbalized strategy used in SCI both as a
therapy and a method to reduce CNP (Moseley, 2007). Similarity
between MI and our NFB protocol is that both modulate the
alpha/sensory-motor rhythm. MI results in the suppression of
SMR (movement event related desynchronisation) (Pfurtscheller
and Lopes da Silva, 1999) while our protocol rewards the increase
of SMR (synchronization). Gustin et al. (2010) showed that
prolonged MI in people with CNP due to SCI increases pain.
With that respect, one might expect that the opposite, i.e.,
increase of SMR would reduce CNP as shown in our study.
On the contrary, Moseley (2007) showed that motor imagery
combined with a visual illusion reduces neuropathic pain in
people with SCI. However, Moseley recruited mostly people with
at level pain while in Gustin et al. (2010) participants had pain
had under the level of injury CNP. In a case report, Yoshida et al.
(2016) also showed that motor imagery training to increase SRM
resulted in reduced neuropathic pain in a single participant with
SCI who received 4 months of training. A systematic review of
application of MI in SCI shows that MI has rehabilitation benefits
but that effect on pain is inconclusive (Aikat and Dua, 2016).

theta and beta activity also minimized the eye movement (theta)
and muscular artifacts (beta).
We showed that 8 out of 15 participants achieved a clinically
significant (larger than 30%) reduction in pain. We did not
specifically check for how long the pain subsided, but judging
by the frequency of use, the effect lasted from 1 to 3 days.
This is comparable to the effect of medication and of other
neurostimulation techniques (O’Connell et al., 2018). CNP is
a chronic condition, and although NFB has a potential to
target EEG features and to presumably restore the default mode
network, the cause of CNP is the injury of the spinal cord which
cannot be treated.
The main signatures of CNP are increased theta activity and
reduced dominant alpha frequency (Sarnthein et al., 2006; Boord
et al., 2008; Vuckovic et al., 2014). Reduced alpha activity has
also been related to chronic pain in general (Camfferman et al.,
2017). More recently we identified reduced alpha activity and
reduced dominant alpha frequency as early, predictive markers
of CNP (Vuckovic et al., 2018b). In the current study we show
that individual alpha band in most participants has shifted toward
the theta band frequency range. We also showed that none of
the participants who reported reduced pain had increased their
individual alpha peaks, which stayed around 8 Hz. From this
we may conclude that the level of alpha synchronization, rather
than its peak frequency is related to the cause of pain. Reduced
dominant frequency has been also reported in people with SCI
who do not suffer from CNP (Tran et al., 2004). Increased alpha
power in people with SCI related CNP, reported in some previous
studies (Jensen et al., 2013b) may be at least partially related to the
fact that researchers were looking in too high frequency range.
Peak alpha band frequency varies among healthy individuals
and is age dependent (Niedermeyer, 1999). From that reason,
some NFB studies are based on individual frequency bands with
respect to the individual peak alpha frequency αp (Quaedflieg
et al., 2016; Lavy et al., 2019).
Increasing the alpha power, effectively means increasing the
level of synchronization, i.e., bringing the sensory-motor area to
an inactive state. Several EEG and fMRI studies indicated that
CNP in the SCI population is related to the overactive sensorymotor cortex (Sarnthein et al., 2006; Gustin et al., 2010) and we
also showed that prolonged NFB practice relates to decreased
event related desynchronization during imagined movements of
both painful and non-painful limbs (Hasan et al., 2016).
There are several limitations of this study. First of all
we did not have a control group, as this would have been
difficult and potentially unethical to organize in a self-managed
study taking place over several months and requiring lots of
participants’ engagement.
The role of placebo in pain treatments should not be
underestimated (Cragg et al., 2016), as even the randomized
controlled trial with one of the most widely used medication for
CNP, pregabalin, showed that while about half of the participants
taking gabapentin experienced a moderate reduction in pain
(30%) and at the same time, one third of people taking placebo
also experienced a moderate reduction in pain (Wiffen et al.,
2017). The placebo effect might be even higher in NFB due to the
fact that participants were given active “control” over their pain.

NFB with the intention of adjusting the difficulty level for the
participant’s performance. We used a fixed threshold in this study
as it would have been difficult to perform quantitative analysis
based on a variable threshold and also because variable threshold
could lead to training in the opposite direction of the desired one
(Ros et al., 2014).
Self-reported neuromodulation techniques through NFB
included some pleasant episodic memories which indicate
possible involvement of the default mode network (Sestieri
et al., 2011). Our collaborators who used the same NFB
equipment and protocol as our group tested the NFB mental
strategy in ten participants with SCI and CNP (Anil et al.,
2019). They showed that a mental state (e.g., attentiveness)
rather than a mental strategy (e.g., imagination), was associated
with neuromodulation success. They also showed that people
who were unsuccessful in self-regulating their brainwaves also
could not differentiate between successful and unsuccessful
mental strategies.
In conclusion NFB may provide a clinically significant
reduction of pain that lasts up to several days and people
experienced with the technique may apply it even without the
feedback. During NBF which results in reduction of CNP, people
modulate their specific rather than fixed frequency bands. People
with CNP can use NFB on their own without help of a trained
professional. NFB does not provide cure for CNP and similar to
pharmacological treatments would require long term use.

The other limitation of our study is that the total duration
and the total number of NFB sessions varied among participants.
However, as one of the primary goals was to observe the
self-managed usage pattern, this provided us with valuable
information about frequency of use of NFB which for most
participants was about three times a week for 20–30 min.
In this study most participants were taking drugs, such as
antidepressants or anticonvulsants, which in large doses (more
than normally prescribed) might increase the frequency content
in the theta band (Bauer and Bauer, 2005; Wauquier, 2005). To
the best of our knowledge all participants received medications
in doses prescribed by a medical specialist.
Finally because it was necessary to reduce the setup time, EEG
was recorded from one electrode only, which was sufficient to
understand the neuromodulation strategy but did not allow for
the exploration of the effect of NFB on wider cortical structures.
A randomized controlled trial with a modified NFB protocol,
focused on participant individual alpha band should be
performed to confirm the efficiency of the therapy. The analysis
of non-oscillatory, scale-free cortical activity (e.g., fractals, long
range temporal correlations (Dimitriadis and Linden, 2016;
Kesiæ and Spasiæ, 2016) should confirm whether NFB bring
the neural system in the state of self-organizing criticality
Hernandez-Urbina and Michael Herrmann, 2016) which is
considered a state of homeostatic set-point (Ros et al., 2014).
A study in controlled conditions would also provide an
opportunity to regularly test the mental states at the time of NFB
(STAI form Y1-Y2 (Spielberger et al., 1983), BDI-II (Beck et al.,
1996) and workload (NTLI NASA, 1986) as it might affect both
participants ability to modulate their brain waves and to perceive
the benefit of the therapy.
In this study all participants used the same protocol and
the same electrode location, irrespective of the location of pain.
In our previous study (Hassan et al., 2015) we showed that
C3 was also effective in reducing pain but that it occasionally
evoked spasms. A Cochrane review of rTMS and rDCS studies
also showed that studies that targeted the motor cortex do not
necessarily stimulate in a somatotopic manner with respect to
the location of perceived pain. We believe taht the underlying
mechanism is common in rTMS, tDCS, and NFB. CNP is seen by
some researchers as a disrupted homeostatic state, in particular
disrupted thermosensory inhibitory process (Craig, 2002). Thus
neuromodulatory techniques for treatment of CNP maybe seen
as therapies that tune the cortical activity toward a homeostatic
setpoint. The main advantages of NFB over the other two
modalities are that it potentially has less side effects as it does
not apply an external electrical or magnetic stimulation, does
not require an additional device and most importantly provides
to participants an external locus of control and empowers them
to actively contribute toward the reduction in pain. Hypnosis is
another neuromodulatory technique which is believed to have a
similar neuromodulatory mechanism to NFB, rTMS, and tDCS
(Jensen et al., 2016).
Neurofeedback practitioners often set a variable NFB
threshold which self-adjusts based on the last several minutes of
