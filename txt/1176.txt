Abstract: The paper presents the application of natural materials, especially wood, which are
relevant for human well-being in built environments of health, social, and day care facilities. These
properties were tested by a complex methodology in a case study in the wooden waiting room at
National Oncology Institute in Bratislava. In this space, experimental tests of physiological responses
were further executed on 50 volunteers moving in the waiting room for 20 min. In this article,
the EEG (electroencephalograph) (four persons) and emotions from the faces of all our volunteers
before entering and after a stay in a wooden waiting room were recorded. Specifically, the ECG
(electrocardiograph), heart rate (HR), and respiration activity were measured by using our own
designed ECG holter (40 persons), and also blood pressure and cortisol levels were observed. The
usage of wooden materials verifies their regenerative and positive impact on the human nervous
system, through the appealing aesthetics (color, texture, and structures), high contact comfort, pleasant
smell, possibility to regulate air humidity, volatile organic compound emissions (VOC-emissions),
and acoustic well-being in the space.

1. Introduction
Due to the aging of the population, reduced natality, and decreasing mortality connected with
progress in health care in most EU and other developed countries, there is a strong need to explore the
characteristics of the built environments of health care, social, and day care facilities. Even though
concepts of home care are widely supported, acute or long-lasting health problems will still be managed
in the hospitals and clinics of different health care facilities.
Among architectural typologies, the design of hospitals is considered one of the most complex
commissions for architects. In terms of honorarium levels for architects, hospitals can be found
in the highest ranks, the fourth or fifth level. Renovation of any building adds 20% to the final

honorarium for architects. Today, most public commissions come from public procurements. It
cannot be expected that good, recognized, and award-winning architects would work on such a
commission. Construction engineers belong to the Slovak Chamber of Architects and can compete in
those procurements. Engineers are not educated to bring architectural quality to the projects and can
work only on structural and technological issues. They have the advantage of delivering projects for
lower prices. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve complex quality under these conditions.
The majority of Slovakian hospitals and other health care facilities were built in the time of socialism,
and few of them have gone through complex renovations [1]. Grant systems are set to bring measurable
outcomes, such as the energy efficiency of buildings. This is addressed by generous additional thermal
insulation of buildings, new external plastering of facades, and replacement of technologies. Very
few interiors of these buildings have been complexly and programmatically renovated. Hospitals in
Slovakia are evaluated negatively in terms of their cold and impersonal environments, monotonous
and depressive interiors, non-logical layouts, lack of non-barrier solutions, archaic interior facilities,
inappropriate illumination, noise, etc. These spaces do not reflect qualities, such as safety, familiarity,
or client-friendly treatment, but end in disorientation and stress [1]. Across the entire world, visible
trends can be observed of hospitals being designed by architects. Swiss “starchitects” Herzog and
de Meuron, whose work is famous for its special focus on detail, are working on the design of New
North Zealand Hospital in Hillerød (Denmark). The concept of Maggie’s centres for cancer care is also
well known across Britain and other parts of Europe, where famous architects (Steven Holl, Benedeta
Tagliabue etc.) are designing facilities. Austria offers locally sourced design and execution, with a
focus on wooden architecture and identity (Dietger Wissounig Architekten—Gesundheitseinrichtung
Josefhof and others), while hospitals designed by consultants or engineering specialists that lack the
architectural qualities usually connected to a humanistic approach are currently being built in Slovakia
(LT Projekt, Dutch health architects, and others). Today, modern hospitals are designed with a focus
on the humanization of their environments, and the needs of patients and staff are prioritized. They
offer services, such as a post office, bank, hair salon, supermarket, cinema, library, and restaurants [1].
Entrance, communication, and waiting areas are designed for a quality and homey feeling. It is very
economically demanding to change the principal concepts of existing hospitals; usually, it is easier to
build new ones. The environmental aestheticization of existing spaces in hospitals with a focus on
humanization led by skilled architects and interior designers is becoming obligatory. Moreover, there
are many stereotypes connected with the methods of managing and furnishing health care facilities,
especially the application of natural materials, particularly wood.
Biophilia, defined as the affection for natural materials and nature-based concepts, works on the on
the visceral, cultural, and social background of humans [2,3]. Our nervous systems know the materials,
concepts, and principles originating in nature well; thus, these are viscerally related and compatible
with human beings somehow. During interaction with an environmental setting built in this way, the
nervous system is not irritated, and the scanning of the whole surrounding is not needed all the time.
It evokes an association with survival, and the entire human organism can be in a relaxing state. On
the social and cultural level, this inclination can be interpreted through the shared archetypes, since
application and interaction with natural solid materials are an inseparable counterpart of all folk or
traditional art and culture based on available local materials. In contemporary design and architecture,
there are many material innovations, and the natural local materials are timeless and contemporary.
Embracing them in their most simple form into any kind of built environment contributes to wellbeing.
Wood with its natural and emotional impact through visual, tactile, and olfactory interaction
also has positive objective properties of the healthy microclimate, such as great contact comfort,
improvement of room acoustics, the regulation of air humidity in a space, reduction of VOC (volatile
organic compound) emissions (“sink effect”), and antimicrobial properties due to the absence of
surface treatment with all kinds of surface finishing, e.g., oil, wax, or varnish. Unfortunately, without
them, wood is sensible in a more extensive way to surface defect, irregular patina due to wear and
obsolesce, and maintenance in a wet way is crucial. The standard use of cleaning disinfecting agents

guarantees that surfaces are visually clean and without microorganisms. In the case of a “naked
wooden surface”, it is not simple, but it is possible to find alternative solutions. However, is this really
the case? In our culture, the belief that surface treatment with chemical agents, creating a compact film
coating, can protect wood from surface defects and provide easy management and care still prevails.
Trustful information should definitely be provided for users about wood surfaces’ behavior when it
is in contact with any kind of fluid. On a “naked wood surface”, where wet stuff and drops are not
immediately removed and wiped, water and colored fluids do leave marks because of the presence of
pigments in the wood. Individual marks originating from usage and contact with colorful fluids and
fats are initially not appreciated, but later, the created patina can appear as a benefit, especially if it is
distributed over entire surface in “random harmony”. Application of natural oils and waxes on wood
surfaces represent a compromising solution. Manufactured from renewable raw materials, surfaces
processed with them have high contact comfort and are pleasant to touch. However, they significantly
diminish the natural porosity and surface roughness of wood and so many of the positive qualities for
a healthy indoor microclimate are reduced. Waxed surfaces have a compact coating with hydrophobic
behavior. Oil surface finishings, mostly based on flax oil, can contribute naturally to the benefit of a
better indoor microclimate to a certain extent, thus they surround the wood fibers. In the case of their
application in more layers, as recommended for wooden work desks, flooring, and tabletops, a kind of
compact, but a bit elastic, film is created. Usually, they provide complete protection against water spots
and colored food and liquid stains. One of the benefits of oils and wax surface finishing is their simple
method that can be done at home without professional skills and equipment; there is no necessity to
remove the obsolete coating and to apply new ones in more layers, as with synthetic lacquers. If the
“naked solid wood surface” starts to have an unacceptable patina, it can by renovated in a mechanical
way (by usual techniques of sanding etc.), if it is a thick solid wood board or veneer with a sufficient
thickness. These kinds of surfaces have not only a positive humanizing effect on indoor microclimates
but can also have positive environmental impacts. The fewer additives and other chemicals are used
to finalize the wooden product, the better the indoor air quality, and a positive environmental impact
can be achieved.
To avoid the need for heavy additional surface treatment of solid wood, it is appropriate to select
wood species according to the natural and specific durability. An appropriate zoning and technical
structural protection can help too. Zoning means using wood without chemical treatment by at least
those elements that are not in direct contact with fluids. Nevertheless, a very important issue is a
change in the approach of professionals and users, a re-evaluation of prejudices and stereotypes, and
a review of the necessity of chemical treatment of natural materials’ surfaces. This problem was
broadly investigated in the research project Interaction of Man and Wood in 2013. Many collaborations
with other researchers and institutions were done, including the development of super-hydrophobic
surface finishes [4], the investigation of wood’s natural interaction with microorganisms according
to the different surface finishings [5,6], and a comprehensive study of the suitability of wood in
health care facilities. These were finally applied as solutions for hospital interiors and later into an in
situ experiment.
All investigated impacts of wood to human well-being predestine wood for its use in the day,
social, and health care premises and for wellness facilities—places to relax, recover, and work too. The
application of wood in its natural solid form can contribute to an earlier recovery of patients in health
care facilities or to general public health, not only in residential but also public spaces predestined for
long-term stay.
To re-evaluate the prejudices and recommendations and hygienic standards associated with the
cleaning and maintenance of surfaces, more case studies showing the behavior of natural materials
in hygienic highly exposed facilities are needed. Therefore, since 2015, we have been looking for
cooperation projects for the revitalization of healthcare facilities where we could implement an
evidence-based design approach and design thinking. This can demonstrate that natural materials in

2.1. Survival of Bacteria on and in Wooden Boards and Monitoring of the Microbial Quality of the Area
To allow such a study to be conducted, the necessary laboratory pilot microbiological tests on
wooden materials covered the period from January 2014 to September 2015. We chose oak and pine
wood—each in three different surface treatments—the first in a naked wood surface without any kind
of finishing, the second an acrylic lacquer, and the third with a hard wax oil finish (the laminated
particle board was used for comparison). The top of the wooden and laminated particle board blocks
(size 3 × 3 cm) was inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus (CCM 3953) or Salmonella enteritidis (CCM
4420) overnight cultures and kept in closed Petri dishes at room temperature, humidity of 40%, and a
dark–light cycle. At different times (immediately, next day, week, and month, respectively), the surfaces
of one sample group of the blocks were pressed against the agar plates (for 1 min), the surfaces of
another sample group of blocks were swab wiped, and planed off (depth 1 mm) subsequently. Bacterial
cells from the swabs and shavings were extracted by saline solution during vigorous stirring (3 × 45 s);
serial dilutions were plated onto agar plates. The cultivation conditions were: Mueller–Hinton agar,
24–48 h, and 37 ◦ C. The numbers of bacteria surviving on the surface of the blocks were evaluated as
growth intensity (modified contact plates method) and/or the numbers of colony forming units (CFU;
swabbing methods); the numbers of bacteria surviving in the wooden blocks were evaluated as the
number of CFU (using shavings).
Passive air sampling in the area was accomplished according to the 1/1/1 scheme (for 1 h, 1 m
from floor, at least 1 m away from walls or any obstacle) using Petri dishes (9 cm diameter) containing
nutrient medium Tryptic Soy agar or Sabouraud agar. After cultivation at 25 ◦ C for 2 to 5 days, the
number of CFU was counted (settle plates method). Analogous culture conditions were used to
determinate the presence of the viable number of microorganisms on the furniture, walls, and floor in
the waiting area by the contact plates method (using 9 cm diameter Petri dishes) and swabbing method
(surface area of 10 × 10 cm). The results are expressed as CFU [5,6].
2.2. VOC Emissions in Space
As an added value of this study, VOC emissions in the same waiting area were measured and
evaluated, according to regular methods [13]. These were executed prior to the wood elements’
implementation and after 3 weeks and 4 months after the application of wooden parts of the interior, in
cooperation with “Kompetenz-zentrum WOOD K plus Vienna”. The aim was to find out whether “the
naked wood elements” can absorb other VOC emissions and to release them in smaller volumes into
the surroundings—a so-called “sink-effect”. Two VOC samples were taken in the foyer prior to and
following the reconstruction work, respectively. The samples were taken on sorption tubes filled with
Tenax® TA for 60 min, using air sampling pumps set to a 100 mL/min air flow rate. The sorption tubes
were spiked with 1 µL of internal standard toluene-d8 dissolved in methanol prior to the sampling.
The sorption tubes were subsequently thermally desorbed and evaluated by GC-MS (gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry). The identification of the substances was done by comparison
with commercially available spectral libraries and retention indices. The substances were quantified
as toluene equivalents (TEs). All detected substances were summarized in the TVOC (total volatile
organic compounds) cumulative value. The average was calculated from the duplicate samples.
2.3. EEG Recording
For the measurement of brain activity, 14-channel, 14-bit EEG helmet Emotiv Epoc with saline wet
electrodes and a sampling rate of 128 Hz was used (Figures 2 and 3a, Table 1). Alpha waves (EEG (α)
(8–12 Hz)), which are responsible for planning, motivation, solving problems, and organization [8,9],
were calculated. They are recorded mostly in the frontal cortex and in the temporal lobe. Beta waves
(EEG (β) (12–30 Hz)) were measured in the occipital lobe and in the parietal lobe [8]. In the central
part of the brain, SMR (sensorimotor rhythm) wave EEGs (SMR) (12–15 Hz) were measured. They

Heart rate (HR) and HRV (heart rate variability) analysis were obtained from the ECG record [10].
The accelerometer was used only as a supplement to simplify evaluation and artefact suppression. The
HR reflects the overall activity of the autonomic nervous system and this activity change provides

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 3496

a suitable indicator of the human state and mood. HRV is often used to recognize good health. If
the HRV is higher, heart beats are more variable, and the person is more ready for action. Lower
HRV is linked to increased arousal or illness. The usage of HRV analysis is widespread, not only for
medical use but also for measuring emotions, thoughts, behavior, or feelings. From many studies, it is
known that HRV is associated with a lot of factors. For example, an HRV increase is related to higher
self-control abilities, better stress-coping abilities, and greater social skills.
From HRV analysis, the ratio of LF (low frequency) and HF (high frequency) (LF/HF) were
calculated, which can demonstrate the amount of sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous system

Table 2. Types of detected emotions.
Happiness—is the great emotion that most people want to feel. Happy people feel good. Commonly, people
feel this emotion when they experience enjoyable sensations. An important part of happiness is excitement, the
opposite of boredom, which is what people feel when they discover something new that arouses their interest.
Surprise—is a brief emotion that appears when something unexpected happens. Additionally, it disappears in
a moment. If a person anticipates an event, he/she cannot be surprised. Also, if people presume the surprising
event, they are not surprised.
Fear—this is a more negative emotion, in which people fear harm. That may be physical or/and psychological.
Psychological harm can also vary from minor insults or disappointment to extreme assaults.
Anger—is the most dangerous emotion. Anger can arise from frustration resulting from interference, or rage
from subjective feelings of the individual or the objective behavior of other people or from similar emotion
states.
Disgust—is an aversion emotion in which people feel as if they want to spit out something, or they feel as if
they have eaten something distasteful, or seen something related to an abhorrent event, etc.
Sadness—is internalized suffering. Most often, it is the emotion of loss—the loss of an opportunity or the
reward that should follow, negative circumstances, or another’s disregard. The face is pale; the muscles flaccid,
the eyelids drooped.
Contempt—it is a mixture of disgust and anger (not classified by Ekman but often used as an important
component of emotion analysis methodologies). People experiencing contempt judge that they are more than
others.

Universality of emotions around the world—Paul Ekman and his team conducted a series of
researches and experiments in order to determine if the emotions specified by FACS are universally
defined across cultures (Figure 4b). Based on a study performed in the Southeast Highlands of New
Guinea with a community isolated from typical access to mass media and the outside world, the
universality of the most significant displayed and identified emotional expressions was confirmed.
Even communities isolated from civilization and the influences of mass media are clearly identified as
FACS emotional types [17].

All facial features detected and analyzed by landmark algorithms were utilized in order to identify

combinations of detected emotions and facial expressions together with the accuracy of detection and

2.6. Cortisol Analysis
Analysis of salivary cortisol was performed in all saliva samples collected from the volunteers.
Cortisol was measured in unstimulated saliva using a salivary ELISA cortisol kit (DRG instruments
GmbH, Marburg, Germany). The whole assay procedure was completed following the producer’s
instructions. Concisely, 100 µL of non-diluted samples, standards, and low/high positive control were
placed into an ELISA plate. Thereafter, 200 µL of enzyme conjugate was inserted into all wells and the
whole plate was incubated on a plate shaker at 300 rpm for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation,
the whole content was shaken out and washed 5 times with a washing buffer. Next, 200 µL of substrate
solution was inserted and the plate was again incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The addition

According to the state after 3 months and 6 months of regular usage for sitting, there was a
significant presence of dirt spots on the solid wood surfaces without finishing. After microbial
investigation of the spots, it was confirmed that they have no microbiological character, but since the
layer of dirt diminishes the natural antimicrobial ability of wood, and not only for aesthetic reasons,
it is necessary to find a solution for suitable cleaning. The crucial point in the application of solid
wood without chemical treatment is its maintenance. An unusual way of cleaning was proposed—the
application of ethanol-technical alcohol in comparison to the usual chlorine-based detergent “Savo”.
The results displayed in Table 6 show that cleaning with alcohol is more efficient for diminishing
the visual presence of dirt and renewing the natural antimicrobial properties of solid wood without
finishing (Figure 6). The regular cleaning method using a sponge penetrated with the ethanol and
SAVO and pressing it towards the surface was used.

foyer showed comparably low values for these substances. Limonene, which is not only emitted by
wood but also widely used as a fragrance in cleaning agents, was exempted. The limonene concentration
was 43% lower in the renovated area than in the non-renovated area. To obtain research data about the
sink effect with high research relevance, it is necessary to simulate a controllable situation with indoor
air conditions in a laboratory environment. VOC emissions, such as xylen, octanol, 2-ethylhexanol, etc.,

Apart from the positive antimicrobial effect and better air in the waiting room, wood materials
have a considerable impact on human physiology. The wireless devices for the higher comfort of
our volunteers were chosen [31,32]. This article wants to show the importance of an environment on
human well-being. The recording of human brain waves showed total decreases of brain activity in a
wooden waiting room in comparison with the former space. EEG (α) decreased by −17%, EEG (β)
by −13%, and SMR waves by −7%. The effect of wood on the nervous system showed that the brain
becomes calmer and less stressed, probably because wood is natural and more familiar for humans.
The first effect of the wood during the first few minutes was relaxing, while during longer stays in the
wood environment, the brains of our volunteers became more active, less afraid and nervous, and
their memory and ability to think increased. It is justified by a decrease in alpha waves by −4%, an
increase in beta waves by +36%, and a decrease in SMR waves by −65%. It is because wood is more
interesting for human perception. Consequently, the EEG (β) waves are higher during a longer stay
in a wood environment [8] and EEG (α) waves are also lower when people have visual stimuli [33].
Wood smells good and has various patterns [34]. Wood affects EEG (SMR) waves differently in the
hemispheres of the brain. In the left hemisphere, which controls analytic thinking and logic, these
waves were significantly lower than in the right hemisphere. The right hemisphere controls emotions,
art, and creativity, and was not decreased to such an extent. Therefore, wooden materials suppress
thinking activities and let creativity work.
Miyazaki et al. [34] prepared experiments in various forest environments and discovered decreases
in cortisol levels, sympathetic nervous activity, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. A mild
increase in HR and RR was registered in the environment with wood installed. This could be caused by
shorter stays in the wood environment and the “wow effect” of the first contact with wood. Longer stays
may have a decreasing effect on the HR. Parasympathetic nervous activity was enhanced, indicating
a relaxed state and reductions of energy expenditure. In our experiment, a similar physiological
activity in comparison between wood and no wood environments was observed. Cortisol levels also
declined, therefore, showing a tenuous anti-stress effect. In addition, sympathetic activity decreased
and parasympathetic was enhanced, which means that our volunteers felt more relaxed in the wood
environment [11,35].
5. Conclusions
Initial experiments in an actual hospital environment—concretely in a waiting room at the
National Oncology Institute—were designed to maximize the benefits of using natural materials. Wood
has a good influence on patients, and its antimicrobial ability maximizes the benefits of this design.
According to our results, the hypothesis that “the naked wood surface” in direct regular contact with
man gets dirty and the antimicrobial effect reduction in this state was confirmed. However, surfaces in
rare direct contact had the same antimicrobial effect and the same positive effect on indoor air quality.
The goal of this study was also to optimize and recommend the cleaning and care process and for the
zoning of “the naked wood surface” application.
The presented results confirmed the relation of the material and human physiology. The
physiological parameters of our volunteers showed positive reactions of the bodies from the
environment with wood materials and a “wow effect” of the wood on humans. The brain is
under less stress, the natural environment is probably more familiar for the brain, or it has fewer
stimuli. Wood influences the sensomotoric cortex mostly on the left hemisphere, which is responsible
for analytic thinking and logic. Even though there was a hypothesis that the right hemisphere will
be more activated due to being relaxed, this can be confirmed just after a longer time spent in the
space. From the results of the applied different pilot methods, it is possible to conclude that all of them
showed responses and feedback from respondents to the different environmental settings, while a
different exposure time was needed for the synchronization to reach a critical point. In this way, the
methods can be improved and more appropriate for our future studies. There are not many articles

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 3496

about methods that are used to the measurement of the environment’s effect on humans, but they
could be really relevant tools for identifying human well-being.
Another option is to zone the interior spaces of health care facilities and to use wood and other
naturally porous materials only in less exposed areas where they can contribute in a positive way to
the microclimate and well-being. To maintain the level of standard cleaning, it is possible to use oils,
waxes, and lacquers on the intensively used surfaces but to leave other surfaces without finishing. The
wood can be recommended for hygienically less exposed areas of health, social, and day care premises,
such as ceiling and wall paneling in any kind of indoor spaces that do not come into direct contact
with colored and contaminated fluids. This could be a way to change the prejudices and stereotypes
common in building and furnishing health, social, and day care facilities.
It is necessary to educate architects and interior designers about the benefits of using wood not
only in hospital spaces but also in education and working facilities. These are spaces where people
are more exposed to stress. Interiors designed on principles of humanization can help with reducing
such negative effects. For example, the length of patients’ time spent in hospital can be reduced by
using the properties of wood. On the other hand, a tailored design can be an expensive solution, so
the development of wooden products and interiors should be more oriented to standardization. The
results of this research could help with propagation and marketing for introducing more natural wood
in hospitals.
This paper has shown experiences with a complex methodology, and presented results showing
how the application of solid wood contributes to well-being and is suitable for health care and social
and day care facilities along with appropriate zoning and cleaning.
