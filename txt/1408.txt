Abstract—3D vision technologies are extensively used in a wide
variety of applications. Particularly, glasses-based 3D technology
facilities are increasingly becoming affordable to our daily lives.
Considering health issues raised by 3D video technologies, to the
best of our knowledge, most of the pilot studies are practiced in a
highly-controlled laboratory environment only. In this paper, we
present NeuroGlasses, a non-intrusive wearable physiological signal monitoring system to facilitate health analysis and diagnosis
of 3D video watchers. The NeuroGlasses system acquires health
related signals by physiological sensors and provides feedbacks
of health related features. Moreover, the NeuroGlasses system
employs signal-specific reconstruction and feature extraction to
compensate the distortion of signals caused by variation of
the placement of the sensors. We also propose a server-based
NeuroGlasses infrastructure where physiological features can be
extracted for real-time response or collected on the server side for
long term analysis and diagnosis. Through an on-campus pilot
study, the experimental results show that NeuroGlasses system
can effectively provide physiological information for health-care
purpose. Furthermore, it approves that 3D vision technology has
a significant impact on the physiological signals, such as EEG,
which potentially leads to neural diseases.

I. I NTRODUCTION
INCE David Brewer invented “Stereoscope” in 1844,
which is the first device taking 3D photographic picture,
there has been huge amount of researches and developments
in 3D vision. Existing stereoscopic technology [1] includes 3D
glasses, augmented reality, autostereograms, lenticular prints,
Piku-Piku and much more. Eventually the only commercialized technology is 3D glasses due to reliability, stability and
cost. Nowadays 3D glasses has become a popular and indispensable element in consumer electronics and entertainment.
On January 31th 2010, James Cameron’s 3D movie “Avatar”
became the first film to earn more than 2 billion. On April
3rd 2010, Sky launched the first 3D broadcasts in UK, and 3D
televisions (with glasses) are out-of-stock in all the markets in
London. These days all the giant TV manufacturers jump into
the competition of this hot market, and the 3D television set
becomes affordable to most of the family.

However, as every emerging technology is criticized in its
early stage, 3D technology has to face the similar situation.
Unlike some products struggle with the marketing or pollution,
health and safety issues, including physical and mental strain,
accompany 3D technology with its birth. One of the major
TV manufacturers “Samsung” issued a warning about possible
health effects with the formal product release. It describes
a long list of hazards potentially associated with technology
and mentions a number of strict use rules. Actually the sideeffects are far beyond people’s expectation. A lot of viewers
complained about dizziness in front of 3D TV or movies for
a slightly long time. Moreover, the report from one Taiwan
public media said that one cinemagoer with chronic high blood
pressure died from sudden death when watching “Avatar”.
Now it is time for us to pay more attention on corresponding
health researches. However, the investigation of these possible
effects is difficult. No watcher accepts to suffer a medical
examination before they enjoy the visual feast; spreading
inspective health meters on the watcher’s body is not a wise
idea, in the sense that, it will diminish the users’ entertainment.
Accordingly, to take a proper action, a comprehensive and
noninvasive sensing technology is needed.
Wireless health technology is a feasible way to address this
issue. It rooted in the World Health Organization established
project for the environment in 1996. With the popular health
concern continually growing in the past decade, wireless
health becomes a new undependable branch both in industry
and academia. Different from traditional human computer
interface[2], wireless health technology has an invisible interface and play context-aware computing in the background.
Our research sought to develop a system to provide wireless
health monitoring for 3D video watcher. The service can be
provided in daily life outside of traditional highly-controlled
scientific laboratories. In this paper, we presented the design,
implementation and evaluation of NeuroGlasses, a mobile
healthcare monitoring system. This system could provide a
non-invasive realtime monitor and feedback of physiological
status for 3D video watchers. Furthermore, we proposed a
signal-specific physiological signal process algorithm to improve SNR to get more accurate features. There are two main
contribution in this paper: the infrastructure of the monitoring
system and signal-specific reconstruction algorithm.
The structure of the remaining part is as follows. In Section II we discuss 3D side-effects and related physiological
features. The system architecture and implementation are
introduced in Section III. Afterwards, physiological signal
processing algorithm is described in Section IV. We presented

are summarized in Section VI.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Physiological Signals
Physiological signals denote chemical and electrical signals
generated by the tissue activity inside human bodies, which
can provide some clues about vital health signs of human
beings. For example, EEG is emitted by the brain, and EMG
is emitted by the muscles. Normally the physiological signal
can be measured by the bio-potential electrodes, enabling
the people to explore and explain the biological problems
with electronic technology. Here we listed the characteristics
of classical physiological signals in Table I. Each signal
originates from the specific organs and is linked to the featured
disease. According to the signal distribution, the head is the
largest concentration of the physiological signals required for
our research. Additionally, some physiological signals overlaps
with each other, and the same frequency interference will be
a practical challenge.

data transmission, data mining, data archiving and data management in the Neuroglasses system. In this case, a watcher
with Neuroglasses sits in front of 3D display. While he or she
watches the movies, the neural sensors on Neuroglasses noninvasively collect his/her physiological data and send them to
the smart phone device through the near-field body channels.
Meanwhile, smart phone will also upload these received data
to remote servers. The health-related computing could be
launched on either mobile device or remote server.

B. Related Work
Pervasive sensing[3], [4], [5], [6] is a popular research topic
in the last decade. Currently, deployment of bio-potential or
inertial sensors attached on carry-on devices for health applications [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] receives more attention.
However, there are only limited study on the safety evaluation of 3D vision technology. Scientists from University of
California Berkeley [13] built a stereo machine to investigate
the unhealthiness. They claim that the physical strain, such as
eye fatigue, root in abnormal eye movements; researchers at
University of Central Florida [14] claim unknown disparities
will cause mental strain, vertigo and nausea. Recently, Entertainment Technology Center [15] at University of Southern
California began to collect the users’ experience in order to
dig out the pathogen and improve 3D technology. All these
above-mentioned works require high-controlled environments,
therefore, their needed professional assistance and device cost
are very expensive. To address this problem, portable and
low-cost physiological signal monitoring platforms are on
demands.

B. Hardware
1) Neural Sensor Sets: Based on the analysis in Section
II, the Neuroglasses system should be capable of sensing
different kinds of physiological signals that characterize the
health status. We do not take research-grade neural sensor
sets into account. It is because that deploying research-grade
neural acquisition system needs professional assistance. The
sensors have to be put in the accurate location. Moreover,
some of them, such as EEG electrodes, need conductive cream,
which is unacceptable in daily use. So we vote for cheaper
sensor solutions although the interference will make the signal
processing more challenging. Some cheaper neural headsets
are available in the form of off-the-shelf products. Table II
shows a comparison of selected popular neural headsets, where
“-” means the item is unknown. Neurosky cannot measure
EOG and ECG signal; Emotiv EPOC is a powerful EEG
headset and performs a comprehensive sensing. However, its
driver is difficult to use. [16] uses this headset, and they have
to use a laptop for relaying the signal between smartphone
and sensor, which is not suitable in our application scenario.
Therefore, we choose OCZ NIA as the front-end sensor. NIA

functions: flow control and error detection. With 24-bit ADC
and 3.90625 KHz sampling frequency, the data rate from the
sensor is 93750 bps. In term of real-time consideration and
computation limitation, the driver will empty the buffer every
10 samples.
2) Signal Layer: The signal layer is built on the sensor
layer and extract the features of the bio-signal. As shown in
the Figure (3), it has three phases: classification, preprocessing
and feature extraction.

is a headband with one neurosensor. Whenever the user wears
it, the sensor will be attached to the skin at the forehead part.
Different from typical two-pin neurosensor, NIA has three
electrodes: the middle one is the the ground pin, and the side
ones measure the differential signal value. The sensing signal
will be amplified with gain of 50. After filtering, it will be
quantified with 24-bit ADC with and sampling rate is 3.90625
KHz.
2) System Setup: We use PC phone BenQ S6 with 3G
and WiFi as the data acquisition device and central control
unit. The entire system is shown in Figure (2). The PC
phone receives the signal from the sensor and perform some
customized lightweight computation, display the results and
provide the feedback. Then, the raw data or processed data
will be uploaded to the remote server through 3G or WiFi
wireless connection. On the server side, a comprehensive data
mining procedure will be conducted for feature analysis.

C. Software Architecture
NIA sensor received the comprehensive physiological data
and transferred them to PC phone. The software architecture
consists of three layers which are shown in Figure (3): the sensor layer, the signal layer and the application layer. The sensor
layer abstracts from the low-level details and generalizes the
sensor API; The signal layer uses the cognition algorithm of
retrieving the feature of the physiological signals. Based on
the analytic results from the recognition layer, the application
layer will make an analysis, perform the feedback and archive
the data.
1) Sensor Layer: The software of the sensor layer is
implemented in C++. In this layer, several physical-level data
processing are performed. The driver here has two main

Software Architecture

Classification The phase “Classification” will separate
the different kinds of physiological signals from the
comprehensive data. Filter design is the main content in
this phase. Due to the complexity of the filter, the tradeoff
between the quality and the computation cost is the key
issue in this phase.
Preprocessing The phase “Preprocessing” is a contextaware algorithm for the information loss of the data. It
will reduce the interference based after the classification.
The lightweight action will be performed in the mobile
device BenQ S6, and the server will run the computationally expensive task.
Feature Extraction In this phase, we will extract the
features describing the characteristics of the physiological
signals. The extraction algorithm is dependent on the
mark of the features in the time domain or the frequency
domain.

3) Application Layer: The application layer is implemented
on both PCphone and server. The partitioning depends on the
requirement of the task. Basically there are two kinds of action
here. One is the data storage, and it is implemented in servers.
The other is the signal analysis. If the criteria of analysis is
real-time, the computation should be executed on the phone
side; if the key factor is accuracy or long-run trend, server will
take over the task.

IV. P HYSIOLOGICAL S IGNAL P ROCESSING
In this section, we introduce the structure of physiological
signal processing. Figure (4) shows the process of data flow in
the NeuroGlasses system. In our system, physiological signal
processing consists of filtering and data reconstruction.

Figure (5) shows the signal distortion after filtering. It
is obvious that there is still significant fluctuation coupling
with the signal wave. Moreover, the interference with large
magnitude will change the profile of the signal. Therefore, we
need a signal-specific methodology to restore the physiological
features.

Physiological Signal Processing Flow

A. Filtering
1) Filter Design: The raw data from the sensor layer has
a low signal to noise ratio (SNR) and it is necessary to
improve SNR by filtering before further analysis. There are
two basic filter structures: Finite Impulse Response (FIR)
filter and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Filter. Under the
same pass band requirement, IIR is low cost and requires
less computation in the filter realization. However, IIR is
nonlinear and will distort the signal, which will weaken or
even remove the features of physiological signals. Thus, we
choose FIR filter in our implementation. The filter design for
each physiological signal is referred to Table I.
In fact, the behaviors of the filter are not ideal, such as:
the gain-to-attenuation band is significant; the in-band gain
is not smooth. These non-ideal characteristics will introduce
interference and make the feature extraction challenging.
2) Interference Analysis: Basically there are three types of
un-removable interference in the filtered signal:
• Co-Channel Noise (CCN): CCN is the noise with the
same frequency band of the desired signal. This kind of
noise cannot be removed even with ideal filters.
• Adjacent Channel Noise (ACN): The gain-to-attenuation
throughout in the real filter is not zero. The noise in this
transition zone will not be attenuated completely, which
will affect SNR.
• In-Band Distortion (IBD): Different from CCN, IBD is
generated by that the signal within the pass-band will
become distorted because the gain is not uniform.

B. Data Reconstruction
As shown in the algorithm flow in Figure (4), the filtered
data needs to be reconstructed before feature extraction due to
significant signal distortion.
1) Location-aware Correction: The sensor location depends on how the user wears Neuroglasses individually. The
variation of the sensor location greatly affects the sensing
data. In the reality, Neuroglasses restrict the position of the
sensor and the location variation will be within some range.
For simplicity, we model that there are three different locations
on the forehead: left, center, right.
Specific signal processing tools, such as Principal Component Analysis [20] and Local Discriminant Analysis [21],
can explore more accurate location-dependent features. Considering the whole algorithm implementing in the carry-on
device, we employ featured-based reconstruction to correct
other distortions.
2) Feature-based Reconstruction: In order to extract the
physiological features accurately, we propose a movingwindow algorithm to detect and further correct the signal
distortions. Our algorithm has been outlined as below:
With the filtered physiological signal as input, our algorithm
can build a moving-window and move it along the time
axis. In this process, we define an segmentation factor as
sγ = ∂f (t)/∂t to detect the noise interference, where f (t)
is the amplitude of physiological signal under studied. Also,
skγ can be approximated with (fk − fk−1 )/∆t at each timestep. When the segmentation factor reaches certain threshold
value, one concave can be identified and thus two spikes can
be separated.
Next, we can reconstruct the shape of distortion-free physiological signal according to different interference impact:
the noise peak should be removed for positive interference
impact, while all the peaks within the moving-window should

V. E VALUATION
To verify the correctness and effectiveness of our proposed
algorithm, we run an on-campus pilot with 20 subjects, including 10 male volunteers and 10 female volunteers. There are
two sets experiments. The first one is to examine the performance of our algorithm, including location-aware correction,
physiological feature extraction and etc. The second one is to
validate the influence of 3D technology from the change of
the physiological features.
A. Signal Reconstruction and Feature Extraction
1) Experiment Setup: We implemented the algorithm described in Section IV. In the experiment, the measured objects
watch 3D videos when Neuroglasses can record their physiological signal and perform the analysis. The experimental
purpose is to examine whether Neuroglasses could perform
an accurate analysis in terms of physiological features.
2) Physiological Signal Classification: We collect a 16second clip of the field data when the objects watch 3D videos,
which contain different physiological signals. To analyze these
signals, the first step is to remove the noise and increase
SNR. Then, we will do signal classification to analyze the
physiological spectrum, including EOG, ECG and EEG signals
(including alpha, beta, theta waves) as shown in Figure (6).
The processing result show that our algorithm could effectively
classify different physiological signals from raw sensing data.
3) Signal Correction and Reconstruction: We further test
the location-correction algorithm on EOG signals as illustrated
in Figure (7), where Position 2 is the correct senor location
(i.e. center of forehead). The remaining two positions denotes
left and right location, respectively. It can be observed that
our algorithm can efficiently eliminate the distortion due to
different locations.

Fig. 7. EOG Location-aware Correction(x-axis is time, y-axis is magnitude)

4) Physiological Feature Extraction: We also examined our
algorithm in terms of physiological feature extraction. We use
ECG as an example which is one of the three most important
vital signs at a clinic and its significant features are ECG heart
rate. In fact, ECG heart rate is the number of the heart beat
per minute (hpm) and can vary dramatically according to the
different physical states, such as exercise, sitting and sleeping.
Also it will be effected by mood, such as anger, happiness and
peace. It has been extensively used in clinical study for the
basic guideline of the health status.
As shown in Figure (8(a)), ECG signal is interfered by the
noise and heart rate cannot be calculated directly, which calls
for the data reconstruction operation. Ideally, the reconstruction operation should remove the undesired noises and remain
the significant features in the signal. Figure (8(b)) illustrates
the reconstructed ECG signal from our proposed algorithm.
In details, there are 18 pulse with 16 seconds so that we
could calculate heart rate of this person is around 67. In the
same while, we used off-the-shelf heart rate meter to measure
the ECG signal of the subjects. It shows that the calculated
result from NeuroGlasses has the comparable accuracy with
the ground truth and could offer reliable guidance for medical
examination.
B. The Evaluation of 3D Vision Impact on Subjects
The second part is to investigate the 3D technology influence on human beings. We performed a pilot test on campus:

there are twenty objects, including ten males and ten females.
Each participant is required to put on the Neuroglasses system
and watch the same videos with different formats, including
2D and 3D version. Note that these two videos have the
same content and displayed within the same enviroments,
and the only difference is the vision technology. During
the experiments, Neuroglasses system will record the neural
signals. After that, the user experiments will be surveyed as
the reference. For simplicity of presentation, the analyzed data
from one of the subjects is illustrated in Figure 9.
This case study demonstrates that the object shows evident
abnormality on the physiological signal while watching the
3D video. For example, it can be observed that 2D raw data
shows small fluctuation and constant mean value along the
time. In contrary, 3D raw data has large variations (fluctuation)
compared with the data in 2D case, which means the brain
status of the object is much more active within the 3D case. It
could be potentially associated with some neural disease. Accordingly, the extracted 3D ECG signals have larger amplitude
and more peaks. The similar phenomenon can be observed in
other subjects.

R EFERENCES

In this paper, we propose the Neuroglasses and a physiological feature acquisition system for 3D video goers. We
also propose a lightweight location-aware signal correction
and a feature-based reconstruction approach to compensate
signal distortion due to the variation of sensor location or
other noises. By a prototyping of Neuroglasses system, we
show that physiological features can be extracted and corrected
effectively, where features can be processed on a mobile
device, such as a PC-phone, for on-line monitoring or stored
on a server for long term analysis through wireless internet
connection. Furthermore, we show a significant difference on
physiological features between 2D video watchers and 3D
video watchers. In the future, a comprehensive study of physiological feature extractions that are related to health issues
for 3D technology will be involved. Then, we will develop an
effective feature correction and extraction algorithm for these
