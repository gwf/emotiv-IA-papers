Abstract
Distraction is a major cause of unsafe behaviors and decreased safety performance in a high-attention demanding construction
environment. However, few studies have drawn attention on cognitive characteristics of distraction and the method to detect it
quantitatively. To fill the gap, this study investigates the correlation between distraction and mental activity using EEG device,
aiming to provide a real-time approach to monitor the worker’s distraction objectively. In this study, sustained attention to response
task (SART) has been employed to induce the occurrences of distraction in the simulated construction safety inspection tasks. The
recorded EEG data was divided into two groups corresponding with task performance: focused and distracted. By analyzing the
data through pre-processing and feature extraction methods, the objective is to examine indices that enable to distinguish these two
statuses based on time and frequency domain. The metrics proposed are estimated to be associated with cognitive functions like
attention deficit and attention allocation, herein serve as an objective assessment of an individual’s sustained attention degrees and
cognitive failures. Accordingly, this study facilitated the development of cognitive features of distraction theoretically and made it
possible to detect and control the inner distraction leading to unsafe behavior or decreased task performance in practice.

1. Introduction
Although construction safety management has been largely enhanced over recent years, the high incidence of accidents
and huge financial cost recorded at construction projects among all industry sectors still highlight safety management
to deserve discussed. In the United States, fatal occupational injuries in the construction industry have the largest
proportion from 2003 to 2016, more than transportation and over twice than manufacturing [1]. Across the European
Union, the construction sector accounts for 21% of fatal accidents in 2015 [2]. Catastrophic accidents undoubtedly
mean tragedies to both families and construction program, causing irreversible damage to the health of suffers, and
impeding smooth project running. A large body of research pays attention to investigate common and fundamental
contributors to injury and fatality rates[3,4]. Evidence suggests that 88% of the accidents of construction programs
among proximal factors were caused by inappropriate safe behavior [5]. Workers' unsafe behavior depends on a variety
of factors, among which external factors include site conditions, safety culture, and climate, training and education,

supervision and management, internal factors related to individual conditions such as safety incentives, attitudes
working experience, social relations, attention allocation, alertness, emotion, fatigue and stress [6] .
Individual internal factors such as stress, fatigue, alertness that play a significant role in shaping the safety behavior of
workers have been studied [7,8]. However, research addressing the link between mind-wandering and safety behavior
remain inadequate in spite of ubiquitous distraction sources at the site. Not only the work quality decrease with
distraction but also the likelihood of improper operation, careless accidents, and fall accidents increases, even impact
on project cost and schedule [9]. Dynamic environments and potential safety hazards everywhere require construction
workers to keep vigilant. Thirty-four workers were interviewed at the site about the causes of high-altitude falls and
found that 33 workers agreed that negligence and distraction were one of the major causes of the fall [10]. Employees
with repetitive and monotonous tasks like heavy machinery operators, signalmen, rebar tying workers are more prone
to make poor safety judgment because of stuck in distraction. Distraction potentially derives from environmental or
personal-related factors, like noise, moving vehicles, conversation with colleagues and safety incentives, body
discomfort, fatigue, depressed mood or family bothering.
As various sources of distraction cannot be identified and eliminated completely within complex construction context,
especially personal-inner interference, more important is to capture distraction state and manage properly than
recognize each potential source. Although brain waves of distraction have been studied within medical and cognitive
science domains, such findings cannot fit well in the construction industry practically for the nature of task and context.
Therefore, it is yet not clear how to monitor the mind-wandering of workers real-time to avoid unsafe outcomes caused
by distraction. To fulfill the research gap, an objective measurement approach with wearable EEG device is proposed
to detect workers’ distraction, aiming to inhibit frequency and address the occurrence of mind-wandering at actual
sites. The paper provides insight into quantitation of distraction utilizing sustained attention to response task (SART).
More specifically, the authors attempt to build correlates between brain state and behavior performance and discover
indices regarding distraction after analyzing EEG data. In addition to enrich knowledge body, understanding of
detecting distraction can help minimize adverse effect on work quality and avoid unexpected safety outcomes.
2. Literature Review
2.1. Distraction
In fact, many versions of distraction definition can be found in the literature, and what they have in common is divert
the attention of primary task to something else and cannot pay full attention to perform the task at hand safely and
efficiently [11,12]. Distraction usually displays in forms of yawn, drowsiness, eyes wandering, talking with colleagues,
playing mobile phones, texting message, eating or drinking, looking around, or mind-wandering despite look like
focused. Distraction can be into two types: mental and physical, also known as internal and external distracted, the
main difference of which lies in the existence of physical changes and external events [13]. At present, there has been
an enormous increase in the number of studies examining distraction in the area of education, transportation, medicine,
cognition, and neuroscience by emerging physiological technologies but lack research in the area of construction
safety. Combined with physiological measurement, students’ neurofeedback to distinct learning content and media is
useful to facilitate improving the quality of learning and teaching [14]. Likewise, drivers urgently need sustained
attention than students due to distraction is confirmed that account for substantial crashes and traffic accidents [15].
The construction safety department gradually recognized the adverse effect of distraction and Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) set up special regulations to restrict the distraction of mobile phones aiming at crane
operators. A recent study of workers has unveiled that distraction indeed impede hazards recognition levels and the
rationality while perceiving safety risk through an experimental attempt [16]. Chukwuma Nnaji conducted extensive
literature and a survey to summary distraction sources and ranked the impact of each distraction factor, which
construction personnel agreed that poor attitudes, lack of safety resources, lack of familiarity with equipment, site
crowding play a vital role in work safety and quality [9]. However, the issue of distraction and its impact on safety

https://doi.org/10.3311/CCC2019-055
performance, and its sources and countermeasures have been under-researched from a scientific and systematic
perspective in the field of construction. With respect to solutions, Seli claimed that different countermeasures should
respond to different types of mind-wandering [17]. Except for eliminating sources of distraction, capturing distraction
state is crucial to control the phenomenon and subsequent results.
The tools to assess cognitive state in the current study (alertness, tension, distraction, anxiety, cognitive overload) are
divided into two categories: traditional subjective ratings and objective measures. Subjective response primarily
consists of self-reports, and objective measures mainly contain performance measures (reaction time, error rate, task
accuracy) as well as psychophysical methods. Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, Cognitive Failures Questionnaire
(CFQ), Mind Wandering Scale (MWS), Attention-Related Cognitive Errors Scale (ARCES) and Karolinska Sleepiness
Scale (KSS) were put forward to estimate the level of attention and mind-wandering. However, the retrospective
method belongs to post-evaluation, which lost timeliness and affected by individuals’ understanding deviation of
questions to a large extent. Behavioral metrics in driving contain speed variability, lane deviation, the standard
deviation of lateral position (SDLP) and steering reversal rate (SRR), to serve as a performance method to seize
distraction. Nevertheless, these metrics cannot be applied to construction personnel for the nature of task and scenarios
at the workplace. Emerging psychophysical technologies has been adopted in recent years, namely, endogenous eye
blinks (EOG), heart rate activity (HRV), Electromyogram (EMG), wearable electroencephalography (EEG) devices,
functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRs) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). EEG outperforms
other wearable devices to record brain activity on account of its non-invasive, high time resolution and portable
characteristics.
2.2 EEG Application
The reliability of wearable EEG devices to assess mental state has been validated by considerable research. Results of
a breath counting task suggested a significant reduction of alpha-band activity combined with a diffuse increase in
theta band activity, and the researcher found there was a similar increase in theta band as that reported by a study
measuring frontal sites during mind wandering [18]. Conversely, the research conducted by Carryl L. Baldwin et al.,
combined driving task performance with EEG detection and the findings suggest periods of mind wandering were
associated with increased power in the alpha band of the electroencephalogram (EEG), as well as a reduction in the
magnitude of the P3a component of the event-related potential (ERP) in response to the auditory probe [19]. However,
many articles reach a consensus that oscillatory activity in the alpha band of the EEG is suggested to be related to
attention processes specifically the degree to which attention is allocated internally vs. externally [20]. In addition,
research suggested alpha power is associated with lapses of attention to external stimuli [21]. A recent study also
proposed EEG to detect mind-wandering and aimed to predict the mind-wandering state of a person, the results of
which revealed reduced electrodes can also achieve prediction effect and the non-linear Support Vector Regression
(SVR) model showed significantly better precision than linear SVR model [22]. However, specific metrics to recognize
if a worker is distracted has not been built, and whether it can apply in the area of construction remain unclear. Up to
now, EEG has been proposed to be utilized at construction sites to assess mental workload, stress and vigilance levels
[23,24]. The construction workers’ perceived risk level can be effectively reflected and quantified by EEG signals such
as frequency, power spectrum density, and the relationship between vigilant attention and forehead EEG was identified
most close [25]. In a word, EEG is plausible enough as an estimator of construction workers’ cognitive state through
extracting and processing features of different brain states.
3. Methodology
3.1 Experiment
Ten healthy postgraduate students completed the SART experiment, of which half is male, and the other half is female.
The age range from 20-30 years old and all participants have normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The stimuli were
presented in the form of pictures against a grey background on a computer screen, which includes two types of pictures

385

JinJing Ke, Xiaowei Luo/ Proceedings of the Creative Construction Conference (2019) 055
https://doi.org/10.3311/CCC2019-055
appearing on the screen randomly. They are pictures workers wearing with and without hardhat. Those pictures are
collected from Google search engine, namely, non-target and target stimuli, of which the proportion of non-target and
target trials is 11:1. To detect internal and external distraction, two groups of experiments were designed. Each trial in
the first experiment is only a picture associated with the construction site, but in the second set of experiment, two
pictures are presented including a picture related to hardhat judgment and the other is interference irrelevant with
construction. The EEG device used in this research is Emotiv-EPOC with 14 electrodes as shown in Figure 1. The
experiment is supported by Paradigm, one of psychology software and the version is free trial version: v2.5 for
Windows.

Initially, participants were informed of the experimental procedure and were required to rest for 5 minutes. Then
participants were instructed to respond to pictures including hardhat as quickly and focused as possible when the
stimuli appear on the screen. If the worker wears a hardhat, called non-target stimuli, participants need to press the
left arrow button on the keyboard; otherwise the right arrow button when the target appears. Meanwhile, the
participant’s behavior response and EEG brain activity were registered synchronously. Each trail just last 1000
milliseconds on the screen until a timeout occurred. A block consisted of 60 trials, so each participant is required to
complete 4 blocks during each group, that is 480 trials totally. After they complete each block, participants will be
asked: “Are you distracted just now?” The participants need to answer from 1 (very focused) to 5 (always distracted).
“Are you aware that you are distracted?” The participants need to select from 3 options: very focused, intentionally
distracted and unintentionally distracted. The duration of each question is about 5 seconds. The whole experiment
procedure is demonstrated as Figure 2. Given that sufficient time is provided to perform each trail in 1000 ms, so
participants are required to keep sustained attention to react in the limited duration, or they were identified distracted
at the moment when giving an error response.
3.2 Data Processing
Data collected during the experiment include self-ratings, behavior performance and brain waves. Self-ratings serve
as a subjective response of distraction degrees, and the role of behavior data is to provide an objective benchmark and
label synchronous brain data. The purpose of analysing data is to find credible indices associated with a state of
distraction. Behavior data recorded by Paradigm automatically contains reaction time (millisecond) and error labels
(binary number) of each trial, as well as a self-rating of each block. Recorded data are analyzed by the statistical
approach utilizing SPSS software, and the Spearman coefficient is selected to calculate the correlation between selfassessment and actual error rate.

Fig. 2. Experiment Stimuli/Procedure

The most important stage is how to extract the features of EEG signals and validate the reliability of indices. The
proposed EEG signal processing method consists of three phases: pre-processing, feature extraction, classification, as
illustrated in Figure 3. EEG pre-processing is vital because EEG raw data is susceptible by various artifacts such as
white noise, line noise, eye blink, eye movement, muscle artifacts, sweat pollution, motion interference and
electrocardiogram (ECG). The main methods are Finite Impulse Response (FIR) band-pass filter from 1-60Hz to filter
noise, and a notch filter at 50Hz was applied to eliminate power line interference. Independent component
analysis(ICA) method supported by EEGLAB was used to reject eye movement and muscle artifacts. In the actual
preprocessing, several subjects showed ECG artifacts, which were also removed by ICA. Then data were segmented
into epochs as trail duration and regrouped into ‘distracted’ and ‘focused’ according to error labels. After preprocessing, signals can be analyzed in time, frequency or time-frequency domains to extract significant metrics.
Feature extraction methods include Fast Fourier transform (FFT) to do frequency analysis, short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) to extract time-frequency information, and wavelet decomposition to focus on frequency bands of
interest. To validate the reliability of indices, support vector machine (SVM) is suitable for the binary classification
problem in this experiment.

4. Preliminary Results
In both sets of experiments, response time in Table1 when making mistakes (735.54 ms vs. 740.15 ms) was markedly
longer than that of correct judgment (553.67ms vs. 588.98 ms). Participants cannot perform the task effectively as
usual when distracted despite enough time. Comparing two groups, the correct response time in the second group with
unrelated interference (588.98ms) is longer than that in the first group (553.67 ms), but the incorrect response time in
two groups make no difference (735.54 ms vs. 740.15 ms). When the workers are disturbed by visual images unrelated
to the primary task, it will take longer to process the task. Likewise, the proportion of error rate in the second group
was significantly higher than the first group, 11.08% and 7.08% in Table 2 accordingly. Surprisingly, the correlation
between subjective judgment and accuracy rate is lower than 0.6 excluding subject 6, so subjective judgment of
distraction degrees has great deviation in the evaluation of the actual error rate.

5. Conclusions
It can be concluded that monitoring sustained attention subjectively exist assessment bias and cannot be implemented
continuously in construction activities. Under the premise without hindering work, real-time detection by wearable
EEG is able to response personal attention-related changes immediately than preventive measures like safety training
and job hazards analysis. Compared with the causation analysis of distraction, detection is a straightforward
intervention. In addition, the application range of findings are not limited in construction but drivers, surgeons, pilots
and other jobs demanding sustained alertness. The main drawback of the experiment is that it is performed in a
contained environment instead of a real construction job site. However, it was confirmed that wearing an EEG device
at a construction workplace is completely practicable [26]. Moreover, the task in the experiment merely simulates one
of the construction activities, sorts of safety activities are supposed to be considered in future works. Excluding visual
interference, the distraction of workers is caused by various factors like fatigue, bad mood or noise around in daily
work, yet it remains unclear whether the extracted features can be applied to all scenarios. Moreover, subjects
participating in the experiment are not real workers, so it is still needed to examine that the difference between
postgraduates and workers. Beyond this, it is necessary to explore the effect of demographic features like gender, age,
and working experience on workers’ sustained attention.
With regard to research about cognitive behavior by EEG, improving the accuracy of filtering is essential due to
vulnerability during EEG signal acquisition. In addition, further research is needed to improve the accuracy of feature
extraction because brain waves exist strong latent ability, and cannot be purely interpreted into corresponding cognitive
behavior from a few features. In other words, forward reasoning from behavior to features does not promise the
reliability of backward chaining from features to represent behavior.
