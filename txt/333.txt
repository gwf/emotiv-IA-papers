ABSTRACT
In this paper, development of non-invasive neural signals to drive a 2R robotic arm is presented. A brain computer
interface based on steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) is used. For stimulation stimuli arrow with different
colours (red, black and violet) is used that flicker with different frequencies of 6.5 and 8.2 Hz respectively. PYTHON is
used for online signal acquisition and MATLAB signal processing and analysis tool is used to analyse signals. Emotiv
EPOC and Arduino are used as hardware devices to receive and transmit signals respectively. At last, signals are given as a
commands through Arduino to a hardware experimental setup. The goal of our study is to control navigation of robot
‚Äúturn right‚Äù, ‚Äúturn left‚Äù through neural signals acquired by EEG database.

The advancement of technologies in this era
has great impacts on human life. Now, people are able
to travel faster and communicate in a more convenient
way than in the past. Assistive computers and
machines provide conventional input devices such as a
keyboard, a mouse, or a joystick to be operated by the
users. These devices are, however, difficult to be used
by elderly or disabled individuals. For this reason,
special interfaces such as sip-and-puff systems, single
switches, and eye-tracking systems have been
proposed [1]. Nevertheless, these specials interfaces do
not work for people suffering from severe
neuromuscular diseases who cannot convey their
intentions or operations to computers or machines with
these interfaces. Consequently, even autonomous
electric wheelchairs are unable to transport disabled
people to their desired locations. Hence, there exists a
growing demand and necessity for developing an
alternative interface that can be used by the severely
disabled population for communication with
autonomous systems.
Brain-computer interface (BCI) system has
been developed to address this challenge. BCIs are
systems that can bypass conventional channels of
communication, i.e. muscles and speech, to provide
direct communication and control between the human
brain and physical devices by translating different
patterns of brain activity into commands in real-time
[2].
A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a
software and hardware system for establishing direct
communication between human and computer, which
enables people to send commands to the external world
through brain activities, without depending on brain‚Äôs

LITERATURE REVIEW
Hovagim Bakardjian, et al. [4]‚Äôs work aimed
to address directly the above problems by presenting
and optimizing two new multi-command BCI designs
based on Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential
(SSVEP) brain responses. Hamzah S. Alzu‚Äôbi, et al.
[8]‚Äôs thesis develops a set of prepossessing, feature
extraction and classification methods that were
implemented to help support and validate the proposed
system and to benchmark it against the latest
developed systems in BCI literature. Ruen Shan Leow,
et al. [10]‚Äôs paper presents the development of the realtime brain computer interface (BCI) system based on
the detection of steady-state visual evoked potential
(SSVEP).R. Singla, A. Khosla, R. Jha, et al. [25] in
their study of four different flickering frequencies in
low frequency region were used to elicit the SSVEPs
and were displayed on a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)
monitor using Lab- VIEW. Four stimuli colors, green,
red, blue and violet were used to investigate the color
influence in SSVEPs.

PROBLEM DEFINITION
This paper aims to develop a real-time
SSVEP-based BCI system for command and control of
a Robot Arm. For effective SSVEP response, which is
dependent on colour and size of flickers and distance
(form observer to subject), the dominating one of these
is colour. three different colours like red, violet and
black are used to check for the optimal colour which
gave approximate frequency equal to the frequency of
flickers. The scope of the work described in this paper
includes:

EEG Recording System
In this work,, the acquisition of EEG signal is
performed by using a 16-channel
channel Emotiv EPOC EEG
recording system with sintered Ag/AgCl active
electrodes. This amplifier relies on the novel concept
that high impedance provides stable and noisenoise
insensitive signals. While it is supported by the 10
10-20
international electrode system, highest standard of
EEG signal quality is always guaranteed.

Bandpass Filtering of Raw EEG Signals
The isolation of raw EEG signals is to
remove the unwanted artefact
fact components. In this
work, frequencies which do not fall within the alpha
and beta bands are eliminated because they do not
reflect visual processing in occipital region. This is
achieved by constructing a 4th order Butterworth
Infinite-Impulse Responsee (IIR) bandpass filter with a
passband of 12 Hz to 30 Hz using the Signal
Processing Toolbox in MATLAB.
The transfer function of IIR filters includes
both numerator and denominator terms and are
returned by the routine butter as row vectors ‚Äòb‚Äô and

and

frequency components which are below 6 Hz, that‚Äôs
why set the threshold to 0.6 percentage of the
magnitude, which altered the lower frequency.

To transform the discrete EEG data from
time domain into frequency domain, the basic Fourier
Transform routine fft(x,n) in MATLAB is
implemented. The fft routine returns the discrete
Fourier Transform (DFT) of any input vector x and
computed with a high-speed
speed Fourier Transform
algorithm. In fact, DFT is applicable to windowed
signal segments to perform a direct examination of
information encoded in the frequency, phase, and
amplitude of the component sinusoids. For n sample
transform,, the fft routine is implemented according to
the formula:

It is clear from the above table that the violet
colour is giving nearly exact frequency to that of
visual stimulus flickering. Violet colour with 6.5 Hz,
and for four different samples, giving an average of
6.68125 Hz which is 0.18125 Hz greater than the
flickering frequency. Violet colour with 8.2 Hz and
for four different samples, giving an average of 7.9
Hz which is 0.3 Hz lesser than the flickering
frequency.

CONCLUSION
Figure 8: Experimental setup

 This paper provides an overview of the background
theories on EEG-based BCI system. The
explanations give an idea on the generation and
transportation of electrical signals within the neural
networks in the brain. Different cortical functions
are mapped to different regions of the cerebral
cortex. This enables us to correctly and effectively
extract the information of interest for analysis
purposes.
 Results of our work, have found Violet Colour is
the efficient which gives the approximate frequency
to the RVS, for 6.5 Hz, obtained 6.681 Hz and for
8.2 Hz, obtained 7.9 Hz which is far better than the
other 2 colours.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

REFERENCES

Fig 9 shows the time course of actual
flipping interval for one of the flickering arrows (10
Hz) presented. Notice that one complete cycle to flick
the arrow from white to black and back to white again
consumes an average time of 0.097315 s, which
approximately equals to 10.2759 Hz.
