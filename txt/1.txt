ABSTRACT
Common Spatial Pattern(CSP) is a widely used algorithm in
BCI application. However, it is sensitive to noise and artifact.
In this paper, we propose a bagging regularized common
spatial pattern (Bagging RCSP) approach for BCI with
hybrid motor imagery and myoelectric signal. We divide the
training samples into packets and choose training packets by
Bagging to extract RCSP features. Furthermore, LDA is
used to project the feature vector to lower space. In the end,
a classification algorithm based on NNC is adopted. The
Off-line experiment on BCI competition III attests Bagging
RCSP versatile. The accuracy increases by 3%-5% in
average than RCSP-A results. Furthermore, we designed and
realized an online BCI system based on Bagging RCSP and
evaluated through experiment involving four experimenters
performing the BCI system of catching the apples. The
results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and
the real time BCI system.

1. INTRODUCTION
With the development of science technology, BrainComputer Interfaces(BCI) embodies the dream of
manipulating reality by our mind. Generally, BCI system
utilizes electrophysiological signals to decode user’s intent
into control commands, ensuing with driving other device[1].
Owing to its non-invasive and low-cost, most BCI system
favors electroencephalogram(EEG) to acquire the signals[2].
Nowadays, BCI research concentrates on motorimagery, P300[3], SSVEP and so on, which are typical
signals that are triggered in certain cases. Among them
especially motor-imagery(MI) has attracted much focus by
reason that it appears without complex condition. Study on
motor imagery indicates that different imagined movements
would induce suppression or enhancement on mu(8-12Hz)
and beta(18-26Hz) rhythms activity and power spectrum,
which is known as event-related desynchronization/
synchronization(ERD/ERS)[4]. However, the low signal-to-

noise rate problem critically impedes its commercial
application. Traditional Common Spatial Pattern(CSP) was
proved to be an effective method to extract information of
discriminating different classes in motor imagery. Key of the
CSP is the joint diagonalization method, which maximizes
the variance of one class while minimizes the other.
Although CSP is popular and efficient, its weakness
also highlights. The main drawback is that it is sensitive to
noise and artifacts[5]. In this circumstance, subsequently
methods based on CSP, for example, CCSP[6], SSCSP[7],
RCSP[8], FERCSP[9], FBCSP[10], were proposed. Adding
prior information into the CSP learning process is
recognized the most impactful, which is well-known as
Regularized Common Spatial Pattern(RCSP)[8]. In RCSP
method, it introduces other people’s data deliberately to
ensure the bias-variance of subject, which leads to a higher
performance than CSP, especially in the small training set[8].
However, there is no clear point on the relationship between
accuracy and the number of other people’s EEG data.
Importantly, until now there is no practical BCI system
based on a small training set.
In this paper, we elaborate an attempt in putting RCSP
into application, i.e., Bagging Regularized Common Spatial
Pattern(Bagging RCSP). Based on it, we design a real-time
system to control the game role’s movement. Different from
previous 1-D control application that only give binary
classification result, we utilize myoelectric signal and motor
imagery to control the role’s walk state and direction
respectively. In the direction control, EEG is firstly
bandpass filtered in 0.1-30Hz. Then it automatically selects
training data by Bagging to extract RCSP features.
Furthermore, LDA is used to project the feature vector to
lower space. In the end, a classification algorithm based on
NNC is adopted. The real-time system enables people to
control direction via this Bagging RCSP algorithm to
discriminate left or right hand motor imagery.
Rest of this paper proceeds as follows. The next section
shall firstly explain the online system in detail, including the
system mechanism, Bagging RCSP and the system control
algorithm. Then a series of experiments are conducted in
section III. Section IV will analysis and discuss the results.
Section V concludes the paper.

2. SYSTEM DESIGN
2.1. System hardware and environment
This system comprising two main components: an EEG
signal sampling device and a computer system shows in Fig.
1. Designing a practical system emphasizes simplicity and
wearability. So we choose Emotiv as the sampling device. It
has 16 channels, and records the electric potentials at
sampling rate of 128Hz. Excluding the horizontal
electrooculography channel and vertical electrooculography
channel which record the eye movements, remaining 14
channels are used. Distribution of channels is depicted in Fig.
2.
2.2. BCI system rule and mechanism
2.2.1. System rule
This system can be epitomed briefly as “catch the apple”.
User controls the role to stop walking by gritting teeth, while
to move left or right by corresponding hand motor imagery
respectively. GUI is illustrated in Fig. 3, where the stickman
represents the role, and the ball denotes a falling apple. Size
of the GUI is 700 pixels height × 700 pixels width, and the
stickman is 100 pixels height × 100 pixels width.
Game starts when the stickman appears in the center of
bottom. After 1s, an apple randomly shows at the top and
begin falling slowly. Importantly, the velocity of the apple
and stick are designed appropriately to ensure enough time
to catch the apple. To be specific, the stickman’s step size is
100 pixels, while the velocity of the apple is 30 pixels per
second. Like other online system, control commands
depends on the user’s mental activities[11][12].

algorithm. Based on the low increment of accuracy with
growing training number, we divide the training samples into
packets. Furthermore, we choose training packets by
Bagging to extract RCSP features, respectively.
A single trial EEG signal is recorded by a matrix D of
N × T, where N represents the number of channels, T is the
sampling number. Then normalized covariance matrix is
DDT
(1)
C=
trace( DDT )
where DT means the transpose of D , and trace(d) denotes
the sum of diagonal elements of matrix d. Then the average
covariance of EEG can be derived from formulation (2). M
denotes the number of trials, and i refers to the motor
imagery class, including left and right.
1 M
(2)
Ci =
∑ C{i ,m}
M m =1
In order to decrease the variance bias of estimate
covariance, RCSP computes the covariance matrix with the
specific subject’s EEG as well as others individuals’[8]. The
formulation is as follows:
γ
(3)
Si ( β , γ ) = (1 − γ ) Χ i ( β ) + trace[ Χ i ( β )] ⋅ I
In the above formulation,
Χ i ( β )=

N

Χi (β )

refers to:

(1 − β ) ⋅ Ci + β ⋅ Ci '
(1 − β ) ⋅ M + β ⋅ M '

(4)

where Ci means the covariance matrix of M trials in class i
from the specific folk, C‘i means the covariance matrix
of M ' trials in class i from other people.
Inspired by CSP, the covariance can be composited as
follows:
(5)
S ( β , γ )=Sleft ( β , γ )+S right ( β , γ )=EVET
where E means the eigenvectors matrix in corresponding to
the eigenvalue matrix V. Then whitening matrix is:
(6)
P = V 1/ 2 E T
So
(7)
c I
P ⋅ S ( β , γ ) ⋅ PT =⋅
where c is a constant. Hence, Sleft ( β , γ ) shares the same
eigenvectors with S right ( β , γ )
Sleft ( β , γ )=UVleftU T
S right ( β , γ )=UVrightU

(8)
T

Then we can conclude the projection matrix W =U T P .
Similar to CSP, RCSP choose the first and last r columns
of W to project a single trial D.
(9)
Z = WD
Then the discriminative feature vector y is constructed as
follows:
var( zq )
(10)
yq = log( 2 r
)
∑ var( zq )

2.2.2. The Bagging RCSP algorithm

2.2.3. System mechanism
The stickman’s movement is determined by detection result
of motor imagery and myoelectric signals. Its position model
is
x(k + 1)= x(k ) + c(k ) ⋅ vs
(11)
where c(k ) denotes the k th judgement: -1 for ”left”, 0 for
“stop”, 1 for “right”. Diagram of the algorithm shows in Fig.
4. Firstly, system acquires EEG by a 2s window ending at
the current time point. Then it determines the walking state
via myoelectric signals. In details, electrodes potential will
exceed a certain threshold if user grits his/her teeth. In this
circumstance, system judges the user to “stop”, otherwise it
jumps to the motor-imagery module: 1) bandpass filtering in
0.1-30Hz.; 2) selecting generic data by bagging and
extracting RCSP features; 3) projecting feature to a lowdimensional space by FDA; 4) NNC classifier. Then system
will refresh the canvas to show the stickman in the new
position.
Threshold in detection of gritting teeth differs from each
other. To confirm this parameter, users will do duplicate
training experiments. It is an easy task in comparison with
motor imagery training. Meanwhile, bandpass filtered EEG
data is extracted discriminative feature by well-known
RCSP[8]. In Bagging, similar test will be held for 5 times. In
the end, a “Winner-takes-all” strategy will determine the
result as most classifiers do.

III IVa[13]. In this data set, five healthy subjects were
attended. Two classes visual cues denoting the following 2
motor imageries {(L) left hand, (F) foot}were displayed for
3.5s[13][14]. During the experiment, sampling rates is
100Hz. According to the competition, a training and testing
set was available for each experimenter, and every set
contains 140 trials for each class. Because this data set aims
to test algorithm in small training sets, it provides 168, 224,
84, 56 and 28 trials for training of each subject respectively.
Rest trials are for testing.
3.2. Online experiment
Ulteriorly, we did online experiments based on the realtime system in Section II. Three males and one female
attended this experiment. Before playing “catch the apple”
game, they were asked to complete calibration task to tune
the model parameters (Fig. 5 illustrates the paradigm of a
calibration trial). At the beginning, screen keeps blank. From
2 to 4s, a fixation cross appears in the screen. From 4 to 6s,
a left or right arrow shows with a beep suggesting
experimenter imagine her/his left or right hand movement
according to the cue. After calibration trials, four attendants
starting the game introduced in Section II. Score will
increase by 1point as a reward when the character catches
one apple. We recorded the final score of every
experimenter.
4. RESULT AND DISCUSSION

3. ONLINE AND OFF-LINE EXPERIMENTS

From the article of RCSP[8], it shows classification
accuracy has a positive correlation with number of training
sample. However, the large scale training sample will
increase the time and space complexity, which confines its
practical application. Most importantly, accuracy is not

Based on Bagging RCSP, we did off-line and online
experiments. The main difference is the source of EEG data.

role’s walk state by gritting teeth for me. However, the
difficult thing is yet the direction control by motor imageries.
We plot the power spectra of raw EEG(see in Fig.6). As we
can see from the spectra, the latter is more easily
discriminated. For my part, there are two main reasons:
1)the number of electrodes. Data for BCI competition III are
sampled from the 118 channels, but our sampling device
only has 14 channels; 2)application environment. We test
the online system in the nature environment, which leads to
the lower SNR. As we stressed in the beginning, the
objective of this paper is to present an applied BCI system
based on Bagging RCSP.

RCSP is demonstrated to be an effective method in BCI, and
this paper introduces a framework of Bagging RCSP,
which can deal with the complexity problem of noise and
artifact since the large generic training scale. Bagging RCSP
is tested on dataset of BCI competition III and our approach
improves the classification result by 3-6% compared with
RCSP. More importantly, a real-time BCI system designed
based on Bagging RCSP works availably. Therefore, the
proposed online system and algorithm are promising in
practical.

enhanced so much when the training scale reaches the
threshold(see in Fig. 6). To be specific, when the generic
training trials aggrandize from 40 to 120, accuracy only
improves by 1.9% in average. Different from RCSP, we did
not introduce much others’ training samples to estimate the
covariance matrix. On the contrary, dividing the large
generic training trial into small packages, and choosing data
by Bagging to predict result is a sensible method. Result of
the off-line experiment shows in Table 1.On the one hand, it
compares the accuracies of the testing data sets for
traditional CSP, RCSP and Bagging RCSP and other
mainstream methods. Based on RCSP, Bagging RCSP
overwhelmingly outperforms traditional CSP with no doubt.
Meanwhile, in comparision with RCSP, the average
improvement by 3-6% also certifies its benefits. On the other
hand, consuming time to work out the result for 840 testing
trials stays steadily when employing Bagging RCSP or
RCSP. However, it increases so dreadfully in FERCSP that
baffles its development in practical. CSP and other derived
algorithm like RCSP utilize adequately the covariance
information. Meanwhile, feature representation has aroused
wide concern in other filed, such as feature representation in
object detection[16], introduction of the new feature in
image retrieval[17],and adoption of feature selection to
speed up the real-time performance[18]. This is our future
work to do.
Table II reveals the experimental results in the online
system. The satisfying score demonstrates it is a rewarding
system. In fact, manipulating the reality by a simple EEG
sampling device is significant, especially for handicapped
man. As an attendant, it is relatively easy to control the
