Abstract. Electrical wheelchair provides mobility to the people who lost their moving capability. To allow most of
the people to be able to control the electrical wheelchair, the best solution is by directly using the brain instead of
using joystick or buttons. The first objective of this project is to provide the basic mobility by constructing an
electrical wheelchair. The second objective is to process the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for controlling
purpose. The EEG device which used in this project to capture the signals is the Emotiv EPOC headset. A computer is
used to receive and process the EEG signals, then send the control signal to the microcontroller of the electrical
wheelchair. All the hardware are connected wirelessly via Bluetooth.

1 Introduction
Nowadays in Malaysia, the number of disabled
individuals are increasing every year. According to the
statistics of Department of Social Welfare Malaysia, it
states that the numbers of physical disabled individuals
are increasing from the year of 2008 to 2011[1]. There
are 445,006 people with disabilities registered In
Malaysia as of 2012[2]. This also shows that the number
of persons who lost their mobility are significant. To
regain the mobility, the most common solution is by
using a wheelchair. However today, most of the
wheelchair requires user's hand to maneuver. Even for the
electrical wheelchair, it still requires user's finger to
control the joystick or button [3]. Therefore, some
patients who completely lost their hands or those who
suffer from Poliomyelitis disease will face the difficulties
to control the wheelchair. In this way, they are unable to
navigate themselves around. In order to overcome this
problem, an alternative way that will enable most of the
people to navigate the wheelchair is directly controlled by
the brain. Therefore, this will bring an extremely high
impact, especially for disabled individuals who cannot
otherwise physically communicate [4].
In order to allow the brain to directly controlling the
wheelchair, it requires the information of the brain
activity. There are several ways to retrieve the signals of
brain activity. They are Positron Emission Tomography
[5],
Single
Photon
Emission
Tomography,
Electroencephalography and Functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging. Among these methods, EEG is the
best method to retrieve the signal of brain activity. This is
because the EEG device is portable and non invasive [6].

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a method which records
electrical waveform from the brain by using electrodes
appropriately placed on the head. It measures voltage
fluctuations resulting from ionic current within the
neurons of the brain [7]. This method records electrical
motivations from the nerves of the brain. [8]. According
to the human thoughts, different electrical waves are
produced. Even for a muscle contraction, it will also
generate a unique electrical signal [9]. These signals are
further processed to determine the mental commands
from the user's brain.
After signal processing, the mental commands such as
forward, backward, left and right[10] can be used as
controlling signals to control the movement of electrical
wheelchair. This is a method which translate brain signals
into control commands, also known as Brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) [11].

2 Problem statement
To provide basic mobility to the people who
completely lost their hands and unable to move by
themselves, brainwave controlled electrical wheelchair is
the best solution. However, nowadays, a good EEG
device is still relatively costly. Therefore, more
researches have to be done for producing a suitable but
affordable EEG device.

3 Design
The basic hardware design is the design of the
electrical wheelchair mechanical structure. This project

also involves designing electronic circuits for the
electronic system of the electrical wheelchair. Software
development is required for retrieving the signals from
EEG device and further processing the signals to
determine the mental commands. The software
development also involves writing the program of the
Arduino microcontroller on the electrical wheelchair so
that electrical wheelchair performs the correct movement.
3.1 Hardware Design
Most of the wheelchairs available in the market have
dimension around 36 inches (3 feet) long and 24 inches
(2 feet) wide. In order to meet the standard size of the
wheelchairs, the size of the base of prototype is 36 inches
(3 feet) long and 24 inches (2 feet) wide. To achieve
stability but considering the weight of the wheelchair, the
material used to construct the wheelchair base and frame
is steel hollow tube. The armrest, backrest and seat are
covered by PVC leather for comfort purpose.

Figure 3. Arduino Microcontroller
Since scooter motor is used, a high current motor
driver is required for driving the scooter motor. This is
because the scooter motor will draw high current up to 10
ampere. A relays circuit board is also used for controlling
the other motors such as power window motor on the
electrical wheelchair.

Figure 4. High Current Motor Driver
Bluetooth module HC06 is used for wireless
communication. This module connects to the Arduino
microcontroller. This allows PC and smartphone to
directly connect to it and receive the command signals.
Figure 1. The Structure of Wheelchair.

The electrical wheelchair is designed with back
wheel differential driven. Since the motors need to carry
a person and also the whole structure, high torque motor
are required. Therefore, scooter motors are chosen.

Emotiv EPOC is the EEG device used to record and
transmit the EEG signals. Emotiv EPOC is the official
headset from Emotiv. It contains 14 channels, which
means 14 sensor electrodes.

Arduino Uno microcontroller board is chosen as the
main controller of the electrical wheelchair. This
microcontroller is chosen as it has enough I/O pins for
controlling the entire electrical wheelchair system and is
relatively small size.

3.2 Software Design

for the microcontroller board so that microcontroller
board will send appropriate control signals to the motor
driver.

For schematic diagram design and PCB design, the
Easy Applicable Graphical Layout Editor (EAGLE) is
used. The openness of EAGLE design resources, such as
its extensive and fully-open component libraries, ease the
design process for all. [12]
Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
[13] is used for compiling and uploads the source code to
the Arduino Uno microcontroller. This software is opensource and is easy to upload code as it only requires USB
cable, no extra circuit needed.
Microsoft Visual C# [14] is the IDE supports Visual
C# with a full-featured code editor, compiler. It is a used
to write the program for receiving the data sent from EEG
device, processing the data and sending the command
signal to the microcontroller via Bluetooth.
Android Studio is used to write an Android
application which can be installed in smartphone to send
the command signal to the microcontroller via Bluetooth
without using the PC.

The entire electronic system includes few main devices.
They are EEG device, computer and microcontroller of
the electrical wheelchair. The interconnection of these
devices is shown in the figure 8.

3.3 Methodology
The first step of the project is to select a best EEG
device for reading the EEG signals. There are several
EEG devices that can be found in the market. The
comparison between the devices is done in table 1. From
the comparison, it is found that the most suitable EEG
device is the Emotiv EPOC headset as it contains the
most channels among all these devices.

Figure 8. Block diagram of the complete brain controlled
wheelchair system

The Emotiv EPOC headset is placed on the user's
head for recording the EEG signals of the brain. The
Bluetooth dongle is plugged in to the PC. It is used to
connect with the Emotiv EPOC headset. In this way, the
PC is able to receive the data sent from the Emotiv EPOC
headset. The received data is further processed by using
the application that wrote by using Microsoft Visual C#.
The data is further processed to determine the mental
command that is thinking by the user. According to the
mental commands, output command signal is generated.
Then, the command signal is sent to the microcontroller
of the electrical wheelchair via Bluetooth. In this way, the
electrical wheelchair is able to be directly controlled by
the user's brain. Besides, an Android software can be also
used to control the movement of the electrical wheelchair
without require PC for sending command signal.
However, the Android application is still not able to
receive and process the EEG signals.
The program flowchart (shown in figure 9) shows
that the electrical wheelchair is able to operate in two
modes. One is by using the brainwaves to control and
another mode is by using an Android application to
control. The smartphone Android application is an extra
feature that allows the user to control the electrical
wheelchair like a common electrical wheelchair instead
of the electrical wheelchair is only workable under the
brainwaves control. Therefore, this program flow
involves few software developments. First, a Windows

The following step is the development of the
electrical wheelchair. This development process involves
the construction of mechanical structure of the
wheelchair and also electronics circuit design. Besides,
this process also involves software programming design

based application is developed by using Microsoft Visual
C# for receiving and processing the incoming signals
from EEG device. After processed the signals, the
application generates control signal and send to the
microcontroller of the electrical wheelchair via Bluetooth.
Therefore, the program of the Arduino microcontroller
have to be written properly so that it will send appropriate
signals for controlling the wheelchair movement. This
program is written and compiled by using Arduino IDE.
