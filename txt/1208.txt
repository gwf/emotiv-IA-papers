ABSTRACT
Eye blink artifact is one of the major problems in electroencephalograph (EEG) signals which mainly affected a
frontal channel. A frontal channel often involved in recent applications of portable EEG devices which require a real time
processing including for artifact removal. In this paper, we proposed a new referencing method in adaptive filtering for eye
blinks removal of a single-channel EEG. The proposed method adopts Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter to extract the blink
components from noisy EEG signals. The extracted component is then employed in adaptive filter as a reference input. We
implemented adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) algorithm in adaptive filtering for the blink removal process.
The reliability of the proposed method is demonstrated on real EEG dataset. By using the signal to noise ratio (SNR), mean
squared error (MSE) and correlation coefficient as performance indicators, the proposed method is compared to
independent component analysis (ICA), one of the widely accepted methods for artifact removal. The results show a low
correlation between a corrected signal and a measured electrooculograph (EOG) signal, which indicates its efficiency in
estimating and removing the blinks from the measured EEG signals. The results also demonstrate an improved
performance compared to conventional ICA method.
Keywords: eye blinks, EEG, Savitzky-Golay filter, ANFIS, adaptive filtering.

INTRODUCTION
Electroencephalograph (EEG) is a medical
imaging technique used to measure scalp electrical
activity. EEG is attached to a head surface when
measuring the brain waves, thus this technique is totally
non-invasive, painless and safe for human. An array of
sensors from metal electrodes and conductive media that
cover the scalp surface, read the voltage fluctuation which
is generated by the activated neurons in the cerebral cortex
(S. Sanei & Chambers, 2007). A system in EEG device is
actually measures the potential difference between two
sensors, which is either between two active sensors, or
between the active sensor and the reference sensor. One of
the widely recognized methods for sensor or electrode
placement is a 10-20 system established by the
International Federation of Electroencephalography and
Clinical Neurophysiology in 1958. The number of ‘10’
and ‘20’ refer to the percentage of actual distance between
the adjacent electrodes to the total front-back or right-left
distance of the skull. The front-back distance is pointed
from nasion (point between the forehead and nose) to
inion (the lowest point of the skull behind neck), while
right-left distance is measured between both preauricular
points. Figure-1 shows the example of electrode placement
using 10-20 international standard placement system
(Fisch, 1999). Brain can be divided into four main lobes
which are frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe and
occipital lobe. Each lobe is named as Fx, Tx, Px and Ox
respectively. X is a number to represent the exact location.

EEG SIGNALS CHARACTERISTIC
The amplitude of EEG signals in normal adult
typically ranging from 1 uV to 100 uV. Meanwhile, the
frequencies from various regions of the brain could lie
between 0.5 Hz to 100 Hz. Generally, the type of brain
waves can be divided into five groups according to their
frequency band. There are gamma (31 Hz -100 Hz), beta
(13 Hz – 30 Hz), alpha (8 Hz – 13 Hz), theta (4 Hz – 7 Hz)
and delta (0.5 Hz – 4 Hz) (Sanei & Chambers, 2007;
Schomer, 2007). The waves rhythms correlated with the
attention level of the brain. Typically, higher frequencies
band representing the focused activity while lower
frequencies indicate strongly synchronized activity such as
during relaxing, and sleeping. Lower frequency in delta
band sometimes could represent the injury or seizure
occurred in that particular brain region.

EEG has been widely used in a brain study due to
its high temporal resolution property and relatively low
cost compared to other brain mapping techniques. The
ongoing development in signal processing brought the use
of EEG to a broader applications, from clinical studies
(Striano et al., 2003) to real time applications such as
neurofeedback (Alhaddad et al., 2012) and brain-computer
interfaces (BCI) (Tomita et al., 2014). Despite its broad
utilization, the EEG signals suffer from the contamination
of noises from various sources. The noises, which are also
known as artifacts, can be classified into two categories;
environmental artifacts and biological artifacts. The
biological artifacts include electrooculogram (EOG)
artifact, caused by eye movement and blinking,
electromyogram (EMG) artifact by muscle activity,
electrocardiogram (ECG) artifact by heart beats, and many
others. Among those, the interference of eye blinks artifact
becomes major problem that cause a serious distortion to
EEG signals which could bias the analysis and the
interpretation of brain signal (Saeid Sanei & Chambers,
2007). In fact, the magnitude of eye blink can goes up to
hundreds times larger than the EEG signals (Croft &
Barry, 2002). The blink artifacts particularly affect the
frontal channel severely because it is located near to the
eyes. The example of raw EEG signals with eye blinks
artifact affected the frontal channel is shown in Figure-2.
The graph in the figure is plotted based on a publicly
available dataset (Oliver & Suendermann, 2013). The
recording was performed using Emotiv EPOC headset. A
distortion in EEG signals appears in frontal channel, F7
and F8, around between sample 150 and sample 250
represent the eye blink artifacts. Note that there is no
distortion in EEG signals for T7, O1 and P7 at the same
sample number indicate that those sensors are less affected
by eye blinks.

Figure-2. Example of eye blink artifact
in the frontal channel.
The frontal channel of EEG carries important
information of frontal lobe functions such as thought,
voluntary movement, and emotions, which is often
involved in problem solving based applications
(Srinivasan, 2007). Thus, automatic blinks removal has
become a vital step in preprocessing considering the recent

focus on portable single-channel EEG devices which
merely consist of frontal channel.
RELATED WORKS
In recent years, numerous techniques have been
developed to remove the artifacts in EEG signals.
Independent component analysis (ICA) is a widely
accepted component-based method for artifact removal
especially for EOG artifacts (Jung et al., 2000). ICA
separates multi-channel observed signals into separated
independent sources. ICA performs the separation based
on the assumption that the recorded EEG signals are linear
mixture of unknown independent component (Jung et al.,
2000). ICA shows a great performance in separating the
artifact from EEG signal into different components for a
large-size data; however it is inapplicable for singlechannel data. In addition ICA requires data storing and
visual inspection on selecting the independent component,
hence, a complete automatic artifact removal in real time
is almost impractical. Recently, the hybrid approaches,
which is the combination of several methods, have been
proposed for automatic artifact removal using ICA
(Junfeng Gao, Yang, Lin, & Wang, 2010; Hamaneh,
Chitravas, Kaiboriboon, Lhatoo, & Loparo, 2014). The
proposed methods successfully remove the artifact without
human intervention but there is still a problem with the
computational complexity.
One of the best options for automatic and real
time processing is using adaptive filtering method.
Adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) system in adaptive
filtering (Haykin, 1996) provides a noise removal
technique which can be operated in real-time and available
for a single-channel EEG. However, adaptive filter
requires a reference signal which correlated with the
artifact source in the noisy signal. Recently, the
approaches of using a camera or eye-tracker based
references to eliminate the artifacts have been proposed
(Kierkels, Riani, Bergmans, & Van Boxtel, 2007;
Noureddin, Lawrence, Member, & Birch, 2012).
Nevertheless, those additional sensors still bring both the
hardware size and cost problem, which is unfavorable for
portable applications. Other methods to tackle the problem
of reference channel have also been proposed. Shahabi et.
al developed a model of eye blink to be used as reference
in Kalman filter (Shahabi, Moghimi, & Zamiri-Jafarian,
2012). The proposed method used Output-error (OE)
model (Morbidi et al., 2007) to model the eye blink
artifact. The reference EOG channel is only needed at the
first time to build a basic eye blink artifact before the
modeling process. However, an additional unnecessary
complexity is one of the issue need to be considered when
introducing a new model into the system. Meanwhile, a
method of using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to
construct a reference signal of ocular artifacts (eye
blinking and eye movement) has been proposed (Peng et
al., 2013). The proposed method was able to suppress the
artifact without implementing a reference sensor, but it is
found to be difficult to select the best threshold value.

In this paper, we present a method to construct a
reference signal in time domain, which is more
straightforward and does not require any transformation to
frequency domain signal. We demonstrate the use of
Savitzky-Golay filter to estimate an eye blink reference
signal for adaptive filter. The proposed method is
advantageous not only of its availability for real time
processing, but also does not require additional reference
sensor for calibration and during recording, thus available
for single channel application. The artifact removal is
performed using ANFIS algorithm. The structure of this
paper is composed as follows: In the next section, we
provide an introduction on adaptive filtering and the
layout of proposed model. The experiment setup and
dataset preparation are briefly described in the same
section, followed by the methods used for performance
analysis. Next, the performance of the proposed method is
evaluated and we compare the proposed method with ICA.
Finally, the overall findings and the limitations on the
current method are discussed.
METHODOLOGY
Savitzky-Golay Filter
The basic concept of smoothing filter is to let the
low frequency components pass through while attenuate
the high frequency components. Eye blinks in EEG signals
are mainly concentrated on low frequency band. Here, the
idea of using smoothing filter for blink extraction so that
the target eye blink which is in low frequency band is
filtered out while leaving the higher frequency of original
brain signals. The Savitzky-Golay filter is first proposed
by Savitzky and Golay for data smoothing based on local
least squares polynomial approximation (Savitzky &
Golay, 1964). This filter was originally developed for
noise removal in analytical chemistry, but it has been
adopted in various areas later on due to its ability to
preserve the peak shape, unlike many other smoothing
techniques (Joensson & Eklundh, 2004; Schafer, 2011).
The output of SG filter is calculated as follows:

signals as well, because there might be overlapping in
frequency spectra between the artifacts and the EEG
signals (Jianbo Gao, Sultan, Hu, & Tung, 2010). One of
the advantages of ANC is it could automatically adjusts its
parameters following the changing of statistical properties
of the input in order to achieve optimal filtering. The filter
suppresses the noise by subtracting the references from the
measured signal based on linear regression process. The
schematic diagram for ANC system mainly consists of two
input which are, a primary input, d(n) and one reference
input, x(n) (Widrow, Lehr, Beaufays, Wan, & Bilello,
1993). In ANC adaptive filter, interference source is used
as reference input in estimating the clean signal while
adjusting the filter coefficients to achieve the optimal
filtering (Haykin, 1996). In this study, the primary input is
the measured EEG signal while the reference input is the
signals representing the blink components. The proposed
method of combining the Savitzky-Golay filter and ANC
is illustrated in Figure-3. The implementation of SavitzkyGolay filter is to extract blink component from the noisy
EEG signal and input to ANC filter. The filter will
estimate the clean EEG signal e(n) by predicting the
artifact component, y(n) from the primary input d(n). This
can be modeled as
(2)

where s(n) is the signal of interest (clean EEG
signal) and x0(n) is the artifact source which contaminates
the primary input sensor. q(n) is the actual source of the
artifact which is correlated to x0(n), while u(n) is the
measurement noise. The output y(n) will be estimated as
close as to x0(n), by filtering the reference input x(n). The
estimated y(n) is to be subtract from d(n) to produce an
estimation of clean signal, e(n). In this study, we
implemented ANFIS in the adaptive algorithm.

where C represents the coefficients value from a
set of weighting factors. The coefficients perform k degree
polynomial which fit to window size, N. The window size
N = nR + nL + 1, where nR and nL are the number of
points used to the right and the number of points used to
the left from the current data point, respectively. The
recorded EEG signals contaminated with eye blinks
artifacts will be smoothed using above equation, and the
output (smoothed values) will be set as a reference in
adaptive noise cancellation system.

filter and high-pass filter to remove the artifact directly
from the signal could possibly remove the relevant EEG

cap type multi channel EEG device, g.tec. The EEG
signals were recorded from 14 points (Fp1, Fp2, F3, Fz,
F4, T3, C3, C4, T4, P3, Pz, P4, O1, and O2) followed the
international standard of 10-20 positioning system. A
vertical EOG signal was measured at upper and lower
right eye by using two disposable electrodes. The device
measured 14 locations of EEG signals and 1 vertical EOG
signal. The sampling frequency was set to 256 [Hz] while
reference and ground electrode were placed at A1 and Fz,
respectively. In this study, we used dataset from 15
participants. The participants were asked to sit still and
relax during the experiment. They were instructed to blink
according to metronome sound that will be played every 5
seconds. The blinks were measured simultaneously using
EOG electrode. The total length of the experiment is 55
seconds including 5 seconds of margin.
We used the measured EEG signals at Fp1
channel for adaptive filtering dataset. The reason of using
Fp1 channel from frontal location is because the position
of this point is the nearest to the eyes and severely affected
by eye blinks artifact. The Savitzky-Golay filter is applied
only on the detected blinks locations. Figure-4 is the
example of recorded EEG signal at Fp1 and
simultaneously recorded EOG signal. We can see that
EOG signal caused by eye blink return to baseline about
2.5 second after the first peak. For this, we apply SavitzkyGolay filter to the measured EEG signal from 30 points
before the first peak to 470 point after the first peak. The
total length of window is 500 samples. This blink onset
can easily be determined by applying peak detection
algorithm with a certain threshold value. The filter
parameters were chosen based on trial and error. We found
that using a combination of k=1 and N=47 produced the
highest correlation to the measured EOG signal. Thus,
these values were set in the parameters of the SavitzkyGolay filter. The example of extracted blink form Fp1
signal is shown in Figure-5. The output values from SG
filter is then input to adaptive filter as reference. We then
perform the filtering on the blink segments using ANFIS
algorithm.

and recorded EOG signal.

Figure-5. Blink extraction by Savitzky-Golay filter.
In this study, we compare the result from the
proposed method with the result obtained using ICA. All
the data from 14 EEG channels and 1 vertical EOG signals
were used for eye blinking artifact rejection in ICA. The
recorded signals were decomposed into intrinsic EEG
signals and estimated eye blink artifact signals. The
signals were extracted in regard to Fp1 point as target.
This channel is chosen in order to obtain equivalent
comparison with the proposed adaptive filter.
Performance Analysis
In order to provide a quantitative measure of the
performance for the proposed method, first, we used signal
to noise ratio (SNR) and mean squared error (MSE) by
comparing the value before and after the filtering. SNR and
MSE values are calculated as follows:

where x(n) is the target clean EEG signal
(corrected Fp1 signal by ICA) and is the corrected EEG
signal by proposed method (for SNR before filtering,
original measured Fp1 signal is used). N represents the
length of the signal.
Next, to measure the degree of similarity between
EOG signals to the corrected EEG signals, we calculate the
cross-correlation between both signals using Pearson
correlation coefficient ρ. We compared the value of ρ
between Fp1 signals before and after corrected. From the
value of ρ, we calculate the performance index for both
methods. The performance index is defined as (Klados,
Papadelis, Lithari, & Bamidis, 2009):

P  mEEG/ EOG  cEEG/ EOG

where  mEEG / EOG and is the correlation coefficient
between measured EEG and EOG signal. Meanwhile
 cEEG / EOG is the correlation coefficient between corrected
EEG signal and EOG signal.

Next, for quantitative evaluation, we analyzed the
effect of the proposed method on SNR and MSE value
before and after artifact correction. SNR here is defined as
the power ratio between the reference EEG signals i.e.
constructed Fp1 signal by ICA method, to the power of
tested signal. The change in SNR value before and after
artifact correction by proposed method is illustrated in
Figure-8. We observed that the SNR for the raw signal was
below than -10[dB] for all of the subjects giving the
average at -15.34 [dB]. On the other hand, the average of
SNR for corrected Fp1 is 0.92 [dB], shows an
approximately 105% of increase in power ratio.
Meanwhile, the MSE values are plotted in Figure-9. The
average MSE for raw and corrected Fp1 signal are 9.93 and
1.50 respectively. The average of 85% decreases in MSE
value after corrected proved the reliability of the proposed
method in removing the artifact component from measured
signal.

RESULTS
The result of estimated clean signal after filtering
is shown in Figure 6. Figure 6(a) represents the example of
measured Fp1 signal with blink artifact, estimated Fp1 by
ICA and estimated Fp1 by the proposed method. The figure
clearly shown that blink segment has been successfully
removed by both methods. Figure 6(b) is a close section on
estimated Fp1. It is clearly from the figure that the
estimated signal by the proposed method overlapped with
the estimated signal by ICA in most of the time. Then, we
compare the filter robustness in estimating eye blink
component from the measured EEG signal. The figure for
comparison of estimated blink with ICA method is shown
in Figure-7. Based on visual inspection, there is no
significant difference in terms of shape and magnitude,
between estimated blink by adaptive filter and ICA. From
here we could say that the performance of the proposed
method is comparable with ICA method.

Performance Index, p

Finally, we compute the performance index using
cross correlation coefficient. The mean value for cross
correlation between Fp1 signal and EOG signal for both
ICA and the proposed method are listed in Table-1. The
filter successfully reduced the coefficient value to almost
zero indicates that the blink artifacts were almost
completely been removed. The value of P is illustrated in
Figure-10. The performance of adaptive filter exceeds the
performance of ICA in all subjects except for subject 7
with a slight difference. Note the value of P for the
proposed method reach near 1 show that there is almost no
similarity between the corrected EEG signal and the EOG
signal. The obtained result is consistent with the
assumption that EOG signal and clean EEG are
uncorrelated (Shahabi et al., 2012). Based on the
performance index, our result outperforms the method
proposed by (Szibbo, Luo, & Sullivan, 2012), which
performed the noise removal by direct subtracting the
values from SG filter without going through an adaptive
filter.

CONCLUSIONS
The availability of single channel data for
adaptive filter is advantageous for the artifact can be
specifically extracted and processed for that channel itself
without depending on other channel. This could be very
promising for portable system to have least number of
channels needed for processing. The extracted blinks using
Savitzky-Golay filter showed a comparable result with ICA
method. In term of the percentage of reconstructed Fp1
signal, the proposed filter produced significantly better
performance than ICA based on the calculated correlation
coefficients between estimated signals with the measured
EOG signal.

Nevertheless, there are some limitations in the
studies need to be considered. First limitation is on the
dataset preparation. In this paper, we used the EEG dataset
with voluntary eye blinks. The magnitudes of voluntary eye
blinks are much larger compared to clean EEG signals. The
duration is also longer than involuntary blinks. Thus, there
are very easy to be detected form their magnitudes and
shapes. However, for involuntary blinks, the signals are
more random and no specific shape or duration. It is
basically comes with sharper spike and shorter period and
could be mixed up with eye movements artifacts. Hence,
further study of the proposed method on involuntary eye
blinks should be conducted to verify its reliability on real
environment. Second limitation is all of the quantitative
evaluation is done based on estimation. The real value for
clean EEG is unknown thus the percentage of EEG signal
retained in reconstructed signal is unknown. A systematic
artificial model of contaminated EEG signal and target
signal is needed to further demonstrate the availability of
the filter with quantitative analysis. The third limitation is
the possibility of filtering out relevant EEG data in lower
frequency band. The Savitzky-Golay filter is a type of lowpass filter. A small fluctuation in extracted blink signal by
the filter may result in subtracting the EEG signal in lower
frequency band by the adaptive filter.
In this paper, we proposed an eye blinking artifact
removal method for single channel EEG using SavitkyGolay filter referencing in adaptive filtering. We performed
the proposed method on Fp1 channel of real EEG dataset.
ANFIS algorithm is then adopted in ANC system to
perform the blink removal by applying the SG filtered
values as a reference input. The filter performance using
the proposed referencing method is then compared with the
ICA method. The result demonstrated a better performance
of adaptive filter over conventional ICA method.
