Introduction

The recent technological developments in
computing have changed the Human Computer
Interaction (HCI) quite significantly. Current desktop
or laptop computers are equipped with speedy and
vast processing capabilities e.g. multi-core processors
with hyper threading, larger and faster main memory,
powerful graphics cards, solid state drive (SSD) based
secondary memory as well as built-in input-output
devices e.g. web cam, sound card etc. These
computers normally run operating systems such as
Linux, Mac OS, Windows etc. Similarly, mobile
devices e.g. smartphones, smart-watch, tablet
computers with 8-core processor, 3GB or higher
RAM, 32GB or higher SSD storage, multi-touch
screen, high resolution cameras, global positioning
system (GPS), Near Field Communication (NFC),
sensors e.g. proximity, finger print, acceleration,
barometer etc. are common nowadays. Many of these
advancements have enabled these devices to process
information in real time e.g. voice commands, human
body pulse rate monitoring etc. Furthermore, the cost
of such devices has dropped drastically because of the
competitions among the leading manufacturers e.g.
Apple, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung etc. The
mobile devices generally run operating systems such
as Android, Bada, iOS, Tizen, Windows etc. The
mobile computing HCI has developed in diverse
directions and users can interact with modern devices
in many ways e.g. touch, voice, heart pulse, body
temperature etc.
This paper reviews some of the latest developments
in hardware and software for HCI in various areas e.g.
specialised input/output devices, virtual or augmented
reality, wearable technology etc. It also attempts to
identify future trends, research directions and
challenges.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows.
Sections 2 to 9 discuss some of the recent innovative
developments. And section 10 draws some
conclusions.

Specialised Input / Output
Devices

2.1 Curved and Ultra High Definition (UHD)
or 4K Resolution Displays
Curved displays or monitors, shown in Figure 1, are
already available as consumer products and are
manufactured by Dell, LG, Samsung etc. These offer
better viewing angle, less reflection, better 3D
experience etc. However, these displays also have
some drawbacks e.g. higher cost, wall hanging
problem etc. [1]. The UHD or 4K resolution displays
are able to produce 4 times more than the HD i.e. in
the order of 4000 pixels horizontally for clearer and
crispier viewing experience as shown in Figure 1.
Many manufacturers produce displays that are curved
and support UHD resolution.

Figure 1: Curved Display and UHD (4K) display [2].

2.2 Curved and Flexible Displays
Mobile device manufacturers have launched
devices with curved displays e.g. Samsung Galaxy S6
Edge [3] which can display notifications, text
messages, weather information etc. on the curved
edge for the convenience of the user as shown in
Figure 2. Other areas of developments are flexible and
transparent displays as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3
that have been developed by Samsung, LG etc. Many
of the flexible displays use polymide film as the
backplane. Polyimides are strong, flexible plastics that
can achieve high degree of curvature by allowing a
much thinner backplane than the conventional plastic
[4]. Transparent displays with transmittance of 30%
have already been achieved which is shown in Figure
2. These displays could be useful in advertising,
security etc. applications.

[4].

Figure 3: Flexible display [4].

2.3 Projection or Virtual Keyboard
It is a small portable device that connects to a smart
phone, tablet or a computer e.g. a laptop via a wireless
technology e.g. Bluetooth and projects a keyboard on
a flat surface to interact with as shown in Figure 4. It
allows the user to use a convenient sized keyboard
without even carrying a physical keyboard. These
devices even take the shape of a key fob. Celluon Epic
[5], the V200 key fob [6] etc. are some examples.

A brain signal capturing headset is able to detect
the changes in voltage when the human brain neurons
are working on a thought. The headset normally
carries a number of electrodes or sensors that are
attached to the human scalp to record the
electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and then these
signals can be converted into digital form that can be
processed by a computer [8]. For example, an epilepsy
patient can pick a soft ball using a headset and a
robotic arm which is shown in Figure 6. Such systems
have been used to drive cars where the driver’s
captured brain signals are processed by a laptop to
drive the vehicle [9]. As an example, the Emotiv
EPOC / EPOC+ headset [10] is quite popular in the
research community. It offers a convenient brain
computer interface with high resolution, 14 EEG
channels and 2 references and is shown in Figure 7.
The headset has been used to drive a taxi, a
wheelchair [11] etc.

2.4 Hand Gesture, Voice Recognising Devices
Today daily life devices e.g. smart TV, gaming
console etc. integrate HCI support to recognise hand
gestures e.g. flip to left or right, move, thumb up,
grab, rotation etc. and voice commands etc. And
based on the user’s interaction, these can perform
various actions e.g. menu scrolling, muting, image
rotation etc. which is shown in Figure 5. A user can
also use one universal device to control multiple
devices e.g. TV, audio system etc. Such a device is
show in Figure 5 as well. Similarly, modern game
consoles and accessories support motion detector, 3D
depth sensor etc. and players are able to interact hands
free.

Augmented Reality, Virtual
Reality, Gaming

3.1 Augmented Reality Headset - Microsoft
HoloLens
Microsoft Hololens is an Optical Head-Mounted
Display (OHMD) that offers 3D augmented reality
platform [12]. It blends holograms with reality where
the user is able to design and customise holograms as
shown in Figure 8. It is compatible to Windows 10
which is the current version of the Windows operating
system.

3.2 Virtual Reality Headset
Headsets such as HTC Vive, Oculus Rift etc. are
very popular in the world of virtual reality, gaming
etc. HTC vive carries 70 sensors, 360 degree headtracking with a refresh rate of 90Hz to produce lower
delay [13]. Oculus Rift [14], shown in Figure 9, offers
low latency 360° head tracking capable of detecting
subtle movements to produce natural experience,
stereoscopic 3D View etc.

Google/LG Nexus, HTC Sensation, Huawei Ascend,
LG G2, Optimus, Samsung Galaxy, Sony Xperia etc.
are compatible to Google Cardboard.

Figure 12: The Google Cardboard [18].

3.5 Haptic Feedback Controller

Figure 9: The Oculus Rift Virtual Reality Headset [14].

3.3 Virtual Mannequin and Virtual Fitting
Room
Many online clothing retailers are now using the
“Virtual Mannequin” technology to reduce the
volume of returned goods because of wrong size or
fitting [15]. The online shoppers enter some of their
basic measurements and a virtual mannequin is
generated [16] as shown in Figure 10. Another area of
development is in-store Virtual Fitting Room. In this
case the customer is able to try the clothing virtually
in real time and very quickly without even going into
a fitting room [17] as shown inFigure 11.

Haptic feedback controllers produce realistic
feedback e.g. force, vibration etc. to the user for
virtual reality, gaming, tele-robotics, medical
applications e.g. computer aided surgery etc. Many
current game controllers already support this feature
in various forms. For instance, the Steam Controller
released by the game developer Valve, shown in
Figure 13, offers two track pads to deliver various
physical sensations to the player [19]. Another
example is Reactive Grip motion controller [20],
shown in Figure 13, that can deliver motion and force
feedback to the user using sliding contactor plates.

Figure 13: The Steam controller by Valve [19] and The Reactive Grip
motion controller [20].

Figure 11: The Virtual Fitting Room [17].

3.4 Google Cardboard
Google Cardboard [18] allows users to build a very
low cost headset to experience virtual reality using
smartphones as shown in Figure 12. As the name
suggests, the Google Cardboard comes with
cardboard, lenses, straps etc. The smartphone needs to
run special application to create the stereoscopic view
for both eyes. Various smartphones e.g. Apple iPhone,

Smart glass e.g. Google Glass is a smart phone like
hands free device that is able to take voice commands
as shown in Figure 14. It is a heads-up display (HUD)
equipped with a camera, microphone and GPS etc.
and can perform various tasks e.g. taking and viewing
pictures, online searching, reading emails, satellite
navigation, taking and making calls etc. [21].
However, Google has stopped commercial production
of the Glass in 2015. Another example in this is
Garmin’s biker’s smart glass.

International Journal of Automation and Computing 00(0), Mouth 20××, range of pages

Figure 14: Smart glass e.g. Google glass and its application [21].

4.2 Smartwatch
Mobile devices are not limited to only phones,
tablet etc. now. Various manufactures e.g. Apple, LG,
Motorola, Samsung, Sony etc. have released smart
watches as shown in Figure 15. These devices
normally communicate with a smartphone using
wireless technology e.g. Bluetooth to make or receive
phone calls, display messages, notifications etc. Smart
watches can also play music, take photos, display
stored photos, perform flight check-in, monitor human
body fitness, run simple applications etc. without a
smartphone [22], [23].
Standalone smartwatches have the functionality of
a phone on top of the features offered by a standard
smartwatch. These devices allow the user to insert a
SIM card into an integrated slot and can connect
directly to a 3G or 4G cellular network without the
need of a phone. The SIM card slot and a typical
standalone smartwatch are shown in Figure 16. One
major advantage is that these can also be used as a
paired device with a smartphone [24].

Figure 17: The CSR and Cellini Bluetooth Pendant and the Netatmo
June Bracelet or Brooch [25].

4.4 Smart Footware
Smart shoe, shown in Figure 18, generates power
using two devices – a “shock harvester” and a “swing
harvester” which produce power when the heel hits
the ground and when the foot is swinging,
respectively [26]. The generated power is three to four
milliWatt (mW) and can be used to power sensors and
an antenna. One of the applications of the shoe is
indoor navigation and rescue operation. Similarly
Bluetooth insoles, shown in Figure 18, are equipped
with a number of sensors, accelerometers etc. and can
monitor activity levels, walking health issues, therapy
progress [27], communicate with smartphones to give
directions using vibrations [28] etc. Another area of
development is Smart sock which is shown in Figure
19. The smart sock from Sensoria has embedded
sensors and is able to produce feedback on the
running techniques via smartphone application for a
sportsperson [29].

Figure 15: The iWatch by Apple [22] and the Galaxy Gear by Samsung
[23].

Figure 18: The smart shoe capable of generating power [26] and the
Bluetooth insole [27].

Figure 16: The integrated SIM and micro SD card slots in a standalone
smartwatch and QOne Standalone Smartwatch [24].

4.3 Smart Jewellery
Figure 19: The smart sock from Sensoria Fitness [29].

HCI has also entered the world of fashion and
jewellery in the form of Smart devices [25]. For
example, the “CSR and Cellini Bluetooth Pendant”,
shown in Figure 17, is capable of connecting to a
smartphone and is able to change its LED colour or
brightness depending on the mood or clothing of the
user. Furthermore, it can also generate notification of
incoming calls, emails or text messages to the user by
changing LED colour or flashing or vibrating.
Another example is the “June Bracelet or Brooch”,
also shown in Figure 17, which looks like a diamond
in a metal e.g. platinum, gold etc. or on leather strap
or it can be worn as a brooch. The device feeds data to
a smartphone and shows summary of the user’s
exposure to the sun. It produces UV index, weather
forecast etc. for sunscreen, sunglasses etc. to protect
the user’s skin from sun damages or premature
wrinkles.

Fitness, Health, Sports

5.1 Fitness Tracking Devices
A number of fitness tracking devices e.g. Fitbit
Charge HR, Fitbit Surge, Basis Peak, Jawbone UP
Move, Swarovski Shine etc. are available nowadays
[30]. These devices can monitor and display
information about the user’s heart rate, calorie burning
e.g. running, walking, gym activities etc. Some fitness
tracking devices e.g. Swarovski Shine, shown in
Figure 20, combines the fashion and technology
together as these can track running, cycling,
swimming etc. activities and can be powered by solar
energy.

Figure 20: The Fitbit Charge HR and the Swarovski Shine [30].

5.2 FitGuard
FitGuard is a mouth guard for athletes which is
shown in Figure 21. It contains accelerometers to
measure linear and angular acceleration. These
sensors can detect activities of the player that exceeds
a safety threshold and can generate warning messages
to the coach’s smart phone or tablet computer. The
device also contains LEDs which indicate a
potentially low, medium or severe injury of the player
with different colours e.g. green, blue, red,
respectively [31].

Figure 23: The Google's smart contact lens [33] and the Bionic Contact
Lens for augmented reality [35].

6.2 Bionic Contact Lens
The bionic contact lens has an antenna to collect
incoming radio frequency energy from a separate
portable transmitter as shown in Figure 23. Solar
energy can also be harvested to provide a boost to the
lens. The total collected energy is used to power the
internal circuits e.g. display to produce the augmented
reality environment, communication with an external
computer etc. [35]. The user can read emails, view
images e.g. using the contact lens [36].

6.3 Ultrasound Fingerprint Sensor

Figure 21: The FitGuard mouth guard for athletes [31].

Many mobile devices e.g. smartphones use
fingerprint scanner for user authentication. A new
type of scanner, shown in Figure 24, has been
developed that uses ultrasonic sound waves to scan
fingerprints and is able to read finger prints through
glass, metal and plastic smartphone covers [37]. It can
even scan through sweat, hand lotion, condensation
etc.

5.3 M-Tracer Golf Swing Analyser
The M-Tracer can eliminate or reduce the cost to
hire a golf instructor or trainer to improve a player’s
performance. It is a small device as shown in Figure
22, can be attached to the golf club to record many
samples of swings during a game. This data then can
be sent to a smart phone for further analysis e.g. 3D
movement, club speed, angle etc. [32].

Figure 22: The M-Tracer by Epson [32].

[37].

6.4 Bio Stamp
Bio-Stamp which is shown in Figure 25 can be
attached to human body skin to measure UV
exposure, body temperature, blood pressure etc. [38].
These devices contain flexible circuits and sensors,
are powered wirelessly and can stretch like human
skin. Bio-Stamps are like temporary tattoos which are
able to replace bulky biomedical sensors.

6.1 Smart Contact Lens
Google has developed a smart contact lens
prototype that can measure glucose levels in tears for
diabetes patients. The lens is equipped with a tiny
wireless chip, a miniaturised glucose sensor and a tiny
LED that lights to indicate high glucose level [33],
[34] and is shown in Figure 23.

Figure 25: Bio-Stamp [38]

6.5 Closed Loop Insulin Delivery System
It is an external autonomous closed loop system
which is shown in Figure 26 for diabetic patients. The
glucose level of the body is read by a Continuous
Glucose Monitor (CGM) and sent to the insulin pump
wirelessly. Based on the glucose level, the pump

International Journal of Automation and Computing 00(0), Mouth 20××, range of pages

injects insulin into the body if needed. Model
Predictive or PID Control, Fuzzy logic etc. are used in
the control algorithm. Such systems are already
manufactured by Medtronic, Animas etc.

7.2 Automobile Projection System
Specialised devices e.g. Navdy’s transparent HeadUp Display (HUD) [43] are commercially available
that can project useful information e.g. navigation,
emails, text messages etc. on the windshield of the
vehicle as show in Figure 28. These devices connect
to a smart phone via wireless technology e.g.
Bluetooth and the driver can interact with it using
hand gesture, voice commands etc. Such devices
ensure safe and legal driving.

Figure 26: A closed loop insulin delivery system [39].

6.6 Nervous System or Brain Controlled
Robotics
It is now possible to read the nerve signals of a
human body and to control an artificial leg or arm. For
example, a patient who lost the lower part of his leg
has been fitted with a bionic leg that is controlled by
his thoughts [40] which is shown in Figure 27.
Another example is brain controlled robotics where
the brain signals are used to control a robotic body
part e.g. an arm. For example, a patient’s body is
paralysed from the neck down. Two sensors
implanted in his brain can now monitor the brain
activities and control a robotic arm. The patient can
shake hands of another person, lift a drink, control a
computer mouse etc. [41].

Figure 28: Navdy’s transparent Head-Up Display (HUD) [43]

Besides specialised hardware, simple smart phone
applications can also produce the projection benefit
for the drivers. For example, the HUDWAY smart
phone application turns an iPhone or Android device
into a projection device as shown in Figure 29. It can
improve the driver’s safety in low visibility conditions
e.g. rain, fog, snow, darkness etc. [44]. The biggest
advantage is that such applications do not need any
specialised hardware to install.

Figure 27: First thought-controlled prosthetic leg [40].

Automobile, Racing

7.1 Assisted or Autonomous Driving
Modern cars have hardware and software to support
autonomous maneuvering e.g. auto lane change,
active cruise control with lane detection etc. With the
auto lane change feature, once the drive activates an
indicator for an intended lane change, the car can
detect lane marker, other vehicles around it etc. and
change the lane when it is safe to do so. A vehicle
supporting the active cruise control with lane
detection feature can keep a safe distance with the
vehicle in front of it while cruising on motorway and
produce warning message in case of a lane drift so
that the driver can take necessary action to avoid
collision with other vehicles. Recently Tesla has
launched the “Autopilot” mode for its latest cars
where the vehicle can drive itself and can interact with
the driver in case of an emergency [42].

Figure 29: The HUDWAY smart phone application for windshield
projection.

7.3 Safety Suit for Motor Raching
Accidents in motorcycle racing can cause severe or
life threatening injuries to the rider. To ensure the
safety, several advanced technology based suits have
been developed. For example, the D-Air Racing suit
[45] which can be seen in Figure 30, is essentially an
intelligent air bag system. It is equipped with
accelerometer, gyroscopes, GPS, 2GB of internal
memory to monitor the movement of the rider for
accidents. In case of a crash, it is able to deploy the
airbags in 30ms.

Smart Home

8.1 Smart Thermostat

Figure 30: The Dainese D-Air Racing suit [45].

7.4 Heart Attack Predicting Car Seat
The car seat which is shown in Figure 31 contains
Electrocardiograph (ECG) technology based sensor,
camera etc. to detect a heart attack of the driver. The
ECG sensors monitor the heart activity through the
cloth of the driver. The camera is used to collect the
position of the driver. Once a heart attack is detected,
the system can take control of the car and bring it to
safety autonomously [46].

Saving energy has always been one of the prime
concerns for a smart home environment. Specialised
hardware e.g. the Nest Thermostate, the Hive
Thermostat etc., shown in Figure 33, are able to
actively monitor the energy use and take action if
needed. The Nest Thermostat is able to detect human
presence using motion sensors and learn the behavior
of the owner. It can be used to control the heating or
hot water supply and the user can interact with it
directly, using an app or via a web browser [48]. On
the other hand, the Hive Thermostat allows the user to
interact with it remotely from a phone or via web
browser, monitor energy utilization, set and execute
heating schedule etc. However, this device does not
support any learning capability.

Figure 33: The Nest Thermostat and the Hive Thermostat [48].

8.2 Smart Bulbs

Figure 31: Ford's heart attack detecting car seat [46].

7.5 Safe Driving Application
Smart phone applications have been developed to
evaluate driving skills of a driver and to generate
feedback on journeys for safe driving. Such
applications use various sensors e.g. accelerometer,
GPS location etc. of the smart phone to record
braking, acceleration, speeding etc. habits of the
driver. For example, the MotorMate application
developed by the car insurance provider
Confused.com is shown in Figure 32. The application
can help driving to improve their driving style.
Furthermore, potential customers can get discount on
their car insurance based on the positive feedback
produced by the application.

LED based light bulbs are already popular because
of their longer life e.g. 30000 hours, power efficiency
etc. Now smart LED light bulbs e.g. STACK bulb
shown in Figure 34, is equipped with sensors and can
react with ambient light, room occupancy etc. The
bulb can turn itself off when the last person leaves the
room or at sunrise, mimic daylight throughout the day
etc. It also learns the lighting behaviour or preferences
of the user and can reproduce the habit the while user
is away e.g. holiday [49]. This can improve the
security of the house against burglary.

Figure 34: STACK down light starter kit [49].

Miscellaneous

9.1 Personal Assistant

Figure 32: The Confused.com MotorMate smart phone application [47]

Leading mobile device manufactures have
introduced “Personal Assistant” e.g. Apple Siri,
Google Now, Microsoft Cortana etc. as shown in
Figure 35. These software tools use natural language
user interface to interact with the user. The personal
assistants can perform various tasks e.g. making
phone calls, sending messages, scheduling meetings,

International Journal of Automation and Computing 00(0), Mouth 20××, range of pages

launching browser, Internet searching, getting updated
traffic information, obtaining weather forecast,
answering questions etc.

Figure 35: The Apple Siri [50] and the Google Now [51].

9.2 Baby Monitors
A number of smart devices are available to monitor
baby activities as shown in Figure 36. For example,
the Sensible Baby SmartOne monitor [52] and the
Owlet Vitals Monitor [53] etc. allow parents to
monitor
baby’s
position,
movement,
body
temperature, heart rate, oxygen level etc. on a
smartphone or tablet in real time.

10 Conclusion
Latest HCI innovations have made many
technologies e.g. virtual reality, personal digital
assistant, biometric authentication e.g. finger print
scanner etc. available to us and have made our lives
convenient, secure etc. Nowadays, we can monitor
our health, manage our daily schedules, navigate from
one place to another etc. using different forms of
hardware and software HCIs. In the desktop
computing HCI, many areas e.g. real time translation
of one natural language into another, object
recognition from images, low cost virtual studio, 3D
scanner to produce 3D printed models etc. can be
identified as the future researches. On the other hand,
for mobile computing, e.g. eye movement tracking,
hand gesture recognition, obtaining heart rate by
putting a finger on the touchscreen for some time,
starting a vehicle remotely, feedback on driving
behaviour, augmented reality headset for vehicle e.g.
engine maintenance, fully autonomous car etc. can be
identified as future researches.

9.3 Real Time Natural Language Translation
Tools

[2]

Many smartphones are able to translate one
language into another using translation tool. Recently
Google has developed a real time translation tool
based on images [54] which is shown in Figure 37 and
supports a number of languages.

9.4 Habit Changing Wristband
Technology can help us to get rid of bad habit as
well. For example, the Pavlok, shown in Figure 38,
can be programmed e.g. visiting time-wasting
websites, launching a maximum number of tabs in the
browser etc. and it will generate an electric shock for
the user to remind of bad habit [55].
