We introduce a new neurofeedback approach, which allows users to manipulate
expressive parameters in music performances using their emotional state, and we
present the results of a pilot clinical experiment applying the approach to alleviate
depression in elderly people. Ten adults (9 female and 1 male, mean = 84, SD = 5.8)
with normal hearing participated in the neurofeedback study consisting of 10 sessions
(2 sessions per week) of 15 min each. EEG data was acquired using the Emotiv EPOC
EEG device. In all sessions, subjects were asked to sit in a comfortable chair facing
two loudspeakers, to close their eyes, and to avoid moving during the experiment.
Participants listened to music pieces preselected according to their music preferences,
and were encouraged to increase the loudness and tempo of the pieces, based on their
arousal and valence levels. The neurofeedback system was tuned so that increased
arousal, computed as beta to alpha activity ratio in the frontal cortex corresponded to
increased loudness, and increased valence, computed as relative frontal alpha activity
in the right lobe compared to the left lobe, corresponded to increased tempo. Pre and
post evaluation of six participants was performed using the BDI depression test, showing
an average improvement of 17.2% (1.3) in their BDI scores at the end of the study. In
addition, an analysis of the collected EEG data of the participants showed a significant
decrease of relative alpha activity in their left frontal lobe (p = 0.00008), which may be
interpreted as an improvement of their depression condition.

Introduction
There is ample literature reporting on the importance and benefits of music for older adults (Ruud,
1997; Cohen et al., 2002; McCaffrey, 2008). Some studies suggest that music contributes to positive
aging by promoting self-esteem, feelings of competence and independence while diminishing
the feelings of isolation (Hays and Minichiello, 2005). Listening to music appears to be rated as
a very pleasant experience by older adults since it promotes relaxation, decreases anxiety, and
distracts people from unpleasant experiences (Cutshall et al., 2007; Ziv et al., 2007; Fukui and
Toyoshima, 2008). It can also evoke very strong feelings, both positive and negative, which very
often result in physiological changes (Lundqvist et al., 2009). These positive effects seem to be
also experienced by people with dementia (Särkämö et al., 2012, 2014; Hsu et al., 2015). All these
findings have led many researchers to be interested in the topic of the contribution of music to the
quality of life and to life satisfaction of older people (Vanderak et al., 1983). Music activities (both
passive and active) can affect older adults’ perceptions of their quality of life, valuing highly the

electroencephalogram (EEG) data (Chanel et al., 2006). Alpha
and beta wave activity may be used in different ways for
detecting emotional (arousal and valence) states of mind in
humans. For instance, Choppin (2000) propose to use EEG
signals for classifying six emotions using neural networks.
Choppin’s approach is based on emotional valence and arousal
by characterizing valence, arousal and dominance from EEG
signals. He characterizes positive emotions by a high frontal
coherence in alpha, and high right parietal beta power. Higher
arousal (excitation) is characterized by a higher beta power
and coherence in the parietal lobe, plus lower alpha activity,
while dominance (strength) of an emotion is characterized as
an increase in the beta/alpha activity ratio in the frontal lobe,
plus an increase in beta activity at the parietal lobe. Ramirez and
Vamvakousis (2012) characterize emotional states by computing
arousal levels as the prefrontal cortex beta to alpha ratio and
valence levels as the alpha asymmetry between lobes. They show
that by applying machine learning techniques (support vector
machines with different kernels) to the computed arousal and
valence values it is possible to classify the user emotion into
high/low arousal and positive/negative valence emotional states,
with average accuracies of 77.82, and 80.11%, respectively. These
results show that the computed arousal and valence values
indeed contain meaningful user’s emotional information.
In this paper we investigate the potential benefits of
combining music (therapy), neurofeedback and emotion
detection for improving elderly people’s mental health.
Specifically, our main goal is to investigate the emotional
reinforcement capacity of automatic music neurofeedback
systems, and its effects for improving depression in elderly
people. With this aim, we propose a new neurofeedback
approach, which allows users to manipulate expressive
parameters in music performances using their emotional
state. The users’ instantaneous emotional state is characterized
by a coordinate in the arousal-valence plane decoded from
their EEG activity. The resulting coordinate is then used to
change expressive aspects of music such as tempo, dynamics, and
articulation. We present the results of a pilot clinical experiment
applying our neurofeedback approach to a group of 10 elderly
people with depression.

non-musical dimensions of being involved in music activities
such as physical, psychological, and social aspects (Coffman,
2002; Cohen-Mansfield et al., 2011). Music experiences, led by
music therapists or by other caregivers, besides being a source
of entertainment, seem to provide older people the mentioned
benefits (Hays and Minichiello, 2005; Solé et al., 2010). Music
has been shown to be beneficial in patients with different
medical conditions. Särkämö et al. (2010) demonstrated that
stroke patients merely listening to music and speech after neural
damage can induce long-term plastic changes in early sensory
processing, which, in turn, may facilitate the recovery of higher
cognitive functions. The Cochrane review by Maratos et al. (2008)
highlighted the potential benefits of music therapy for improving
mood in those with depression. Erkkilä et al. (2011) showed
that music therapy combined with standard care is effective
for depression among working-age people with depression. In
their study, patients receiving music therapy plus standard care
showed greater improvement in depression symptoms than those
receiving standard care only.
Neurofeedback has been found to be effective in producing
significant improvements in medical conditions such as
depression (Kumano et al., 1996; Rosenfeld, 2000; Hammond,
2004), anxiety (Vanathy et al., 1998; Kerson et al., 2009),
migraine (Walker, 2011), epilepsy (Swingle, 1998), attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Moriyama et al., 2012),
alcoholism/substance abuse (Peniston and Kulkosky, 1990),
and chronic pain (Jensen et al., 2007), among many others
(Kropotov, 2009). For instance, Sterman (2000) reports that
82% of the most severe, uncontrolled epileptics demonstrated
a significant reduction in seizure frequency, with an average of
a 70% reduction in seizures. The benefits of neurofeedback in
this context were shown to lead to significant normalization of
brain activity even when patients were asleep. The effectiveness
of neurofeedback was validated compared to medication and
placebo (Kotchoubey et al., 2001). Similarly, Monastra et al.’s
(2002) research found neurofeedback to be significantly more
effective than ritalin in changing ADD/ADHD, without having
to remain on drugs. Other studies (Fuchs et al., 2003) have found
comparable improvements with 20 h of neurofeedback training
(forty 30-min sessions) to those produced by ritalin, even after
only twenty 30-min sessions of neurofeedback (Rossiter and La
Vaque, 1995). In the context of depression treatment, there are
several clinical protocols used to apply neurofeedback such as
shifting the alpha predominance in the left hemisphere to the
right by decreasing left-hemispheric alpha activity, or increasing
right hemispheric alpha activity, shifting an asymmetry index
toward the right in order to rebalance activation levels in favor of
the left hemisphere, and the reduction of Theta activity (4–8 Hz)
in relation to Beta (15–28 Hz) in the left prefrontal cortex (i.e.,
decrease in the Theta/Beta ratio on the left prefrontal cortex)
(Gruzelier and Egner, 2005; Michael et al., 2005; Ali et al., 2015).
Dias and van Deusen (2011) applied a neurofeedback protocol
that is simultaneously capable of providing the training demands
of Alpha asymmetry and increased Beta/Theta relationship in
the left prefrontal cortex.

computing attempts to detect emotion states in users using

There were four people who abandoned the study toward the end
of it due to illness.

Materials
Music Material
Prior to the first session, the participants in the study were
interviewed in order to determine the music they liked and
to identify particular pieces to be included in their feedback
sessions. Following the interviews, for each participant a set of
5–6 music pieces was collected from commercial audio CDs.
During each session a subset of the selected pieces was played
to the participant. Table 1 shows the selected pieces for each
participant.

Data Acquisition and Processing
The Emotiv EPOC EEG system (Emotiv, 20141 ) was used for
acquiring the EEG data. It consists of 16 wet saline electrodes,
providing 14 EEG channels, and a wireless amplifier. The
electrodes were located at the positions AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7,
O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, AF4 according to the international
10–20 system (see Figure 1). Two electrodes located just above
the subject’s ears (P3, P4) were used as reference. The data
were digitized using the embedded 16-bit ADC with 128 Hz
sampling frequency per channel and sent to the computer
via Bluetooth. The EEG signals were band-pass filtered with
Butterworth 8–12 Hz and 12–28 Hz filters. The impedance of
the electrode contact to the scalp was visually monitored using
Emotiv Control Panel software.
The Emotiv EPOC EEG system is part of a number of lowcost EEG systems, which have been recently commercialized [a
usability review of some of them can be found in (10)]. These
systems are mainly marketed as gaming devices and the quality of
the signal they capture is lower than the signal captured by more

expensive equipment. However, recent research on evaluating the
reliability of some of these low-cost EEG devices for research
purposes has suggested that they are reliable for measuring EEG
signals (Debener et al., 2012; Thie et al., 2012; Badcock et al.,
2013). In the case of our study, the Emotiv EPOC device has
provided several important pragmatic advantages compared with
more expensive equipment: the setting up time of the Emotiv
EPOC system at the beginning of each session is considerably
shorter than that of an expensive EEG system (for which an
experienced clinical professional can take up to an hour to place
the electrodes on the patient’s scalp, which results in long and
tedious sessions). Furthermore, expensive EEG systems typically

require the application of conductive gel in order to create a
reliable connection between each electrode and the patient’s scalp
(the gel attaches to the patient’s hair and can only be properly
removed by washing the entire head at the end of each session).
The setting up time of the Emotiv EPOC takes a few minutes
(typically 3–5 min) and conductive gel is not necessary for the
Emotiv EPOC’s wet saline electrodes. However, the inferior signal
quality of the Emotiv EPOC device is a limitation of this study,
and thus it should be emphasized that future studies should
involve the use of a more accurate EEG device.
We collected and processed the data using the OpenViBE
platform (Renard et al., 2010). In order to play and transform
the music feedback through the OpenVibe platform, a VRPN
(Virtual-Reality Peripheral Network) to OSC (Open Sound
Control protocol) gateway was implemented and used to
communicate OpenViBE with Pure Data (Puckette, 1996). OSC
is a protocol for networking sound synthesizers, computers,
and other multimedia devices for purposes such as musical
performance, while VRPN is a device-independent and networktransparent system for accessing virtual reality peripherals in
applications. The VRPN-OSC-Gateway connects to a VRPN
server, converts the tracking data and sends it to an OSC
server. Music feedback was played by AudioMulch VST-host
application, which received MIDI messages from Pure Data, and
in which a tempo transformation plugin (Mayor et al., 2011) was
installed. The plugin allows performing pitch-independent realtime tempo transformations (i.e., time stretch transformations)
using audio spectral analysis-synthesis techniques. The plugin
parameters were controlled using the MIDI messages sent
by Pure Data. Music tempo and loudness were controlled
assigning the corresponding MIDI control message coming from
Pure Data. Both data acquisition and music playback were
performed on a laptop with an Intel Core i5 2.53 Ghz processor
with 4 GB of RAM, running windows 7 64-bit Operating
System and using the laptop’s internal sound card (Realtek
ALC269). Music was amplified by two loudspeakers Roland
MA150U.

FIGURE 2 | Arousal-valence plane. By encouraging participants to increase
the loudness and tempo of musical pieces, they were encouraged to increase
their arousal and valence, and thus direct their emotional state to the top-right
quadrant in the arousal-valence plane.

No artifact detection/elimination method was applied to the
measured EEG signal. Both electrooculographic (EOG) and
electromyographic (EMG) artifacts were minimized by asking
participants to close their eyes and avoid movement. No control
of the interface through eye or muscle movement was observed
during the experimental sessions. However, it must be noted that
it is important to extend/redo the reported study using artifact
detection methods.
The EEG data processing was adapted from Ramirez and
Vamvakousis (2012). Based on the EEG signal of a person, the
arousal level was determined by computing the ratio of the beta
(12–28 Hz) and alpha (8–12 Hz) brainwaves. EEG signal was
measured in four locations (i.e., electrodes) in the prefrontal
cortex: AF3, AF4, F3, and F4 (see Figure 1). Beta waves β are
associated with an alert or excited state of mind, whereas alpha
waves α are more dominant in a relaxed state. Alpha activity has
also been associated to brain inactivation. Thus, the beta/alpha
ratio is a reasonable indicator of the arousal state of a person.
Concretely, arousal level was computed as following:

Methods
Participants were treated individually. At the beginning of
each feedback session, participants were informed about the
experiment procedure, were asked to sit in a comfortable chair
facing two loudspeakers, to close their eyes, and avoid moving
during the experiment. Participants listened to preselected music
pieces according to their music preferences for 15 min. Within
these 15 min music pieces were separated by a pause of 1 s.
Participants were encouraged to increase the loudness and tempo
of the pieces so the pieces sounded “happier.” As the system
was tuned so that increased arousal corresponded to increased
loudness, and increased valence corresponded to increased
tempo, participants were encouraged to increase their arousal
and valence, in other words to direct their emotional state to the
high-arousal/positive-valence quadrant in the arousal-valence
plane (see Figure 2). At the end of each session, participants
were asked if they perceived they were able to modify the music
tempo and volume. Pre and post evaluation of participants was
performed using the BDI depression test.

In order to determine the valence level, activation levels of the
two cortical hemispheres were compared. A large number of
EEG studies (Henriques and Davidson, 1991; Davidson, 1992,
1995, 1998), have demonstrated that the left frontal area is
associated with more positive affect and memories, and the right
hemisphere is more involved in negative emotion. F3 and F4 are
the most used positions for looking at this alpha/beta activity
related to valence, as they are located in the prefrontal lobe,
which plays a crucial role in emotion regulation and conscious
experience. Valence values were computed by comparing the
alpha power α in channels F3 and F4. Concretely, valence level
was computed as following:
Valence = αF4 − αF3

A clinical music therapy study

Valence and arousal computation was adapted from Ramirez and
Vamvakousis (2012), where the authors show that the computed
arousal and valence values indeed contain meaningful user’s
emotional information.
Computed arousal and valence values are fed into an
expressive music performance system which calculates
appropriate expressive transformations on timing, loudness
and articulation (however, in the present study only timing
and loudness transformations are considered). The expressive
performance system is based on a music performance model,
which was obtained by training four models using machine
learning techniques (Mitchell, 1997) applied to recordings of
musical pieces in four emotions: happy, relaxed, sad, and angry
(each corresponding to a quadrant in the arousal-valence plane).
The coefficients of the four models were interpolated in order
to obtain intermediate models (in addition to the four trained
models) and corresponding performance predictions (Figure 3).
Details about the expressive music performance system and our
approach to expressive performance modeling can be found
in (Ramirez et al., 2010; Giraldo, 2012; Ramirez et al., 2012;
Giraldo and Ramirez, 2013; Marchini et al., 2014). In order
to model expression in music performances we characterized

each performed note by a set of inter-note features representing
both properties of the note itself and aspects of the musical
context in which the note appears (Figure 4). Information about
the note included note pitch (Pitch), note duration (dur), and
note metrical strenght (MetrStr), while information about its
melodic context included the relative pitch and duration of the
neighboring notes (PrevPitch, PrevDur, NextPitch, NextDur),
i.e., previous and following notes, as well as the music structure
(i.e., Narmour groups) in which the note appears (Narmour,
1991). We also extracted the amount of legato with the previous
note, the amount of legato with the following note, and mean
energy. We applied machine learning techniques to train a linear
regression models for predicting duration, and energy deviations
expressed as a ratio of the values specified in the score (for energy
which is not specified in the score we take the score value as the
average of the energy of all the notes in the piece). For instance,
for duration a predicted value of 1.14 represents a prediction of
14% lengthening of the note with respect to the score. In the case
of energy it indicates that the note should be played a 14% louder
than the average energy in the piece.
The general proposed emotion-based musical neurofeedback
system is depicted in Figure 5. The system consisted of a

depressed to slight perturbation in the BDI scale. One participant,
who initially scored as not depressed in the BDI pre-test (score =
1), did not show any improvement in her BDI post-score (score
= 4), which was also in the non-depressed range. Either the
participant was not depressed at the beginning of the study, or her
responses to the BDI tests were not reliable. Excluding her from
the BDI test analysis, the mean decrease in BDI scores was 20.6%
(0.06). These differences were found significant (p = 0.018).
EEG data obtained during the course of the study showed
that overall valence level increased at the end of the treatment
compared to the starting level. The difference between valence
values at the beginning and end of the study is statistically
significant (p = 0.00008). This result should be interpreted
as a decrease of relative alpha activity in the left frontal lobe,
which may be interpreted as an improvement of the depression
condition (Henriques and Davidson, 1991; Gotlib et al., 1999).
Arousal values at the beginning and at the end of the study
showed no significant difference (p = 0.33). However, in this
study the most important indicator was valence since it reflects
changes in negative/positive emotional states, which are directly
related to depression conditions.
Correlation between valence values and time within sessions
was found significant (p < 0.00018) but that was not the
case for the correlation between arousal values and time. The
fact that arousal-time correlation was not significant is not a
negative result since valence is the most relevant indicator for
depression.
Taking into account the obtained within- and cross-session
improvements in valence levels and the limited duration of
both each session (i.e., 15 min) and the complete treatment
(i.e., 10 sessions), it may be reasonable to think that further
improvements in valence could have been reached if sessions
and/or treatment had been longer. We plan to investigate the
impact of treatments with longer duration in the future.
Very few studies in the literature have examined the long-term
effect of neurofeedback, but the few studies that did it found
promising results (Gani et al., 2008; Gevensleben et al., 2010).
Both Gani et al. (2008) and Gevensleben et al. (2010) showed that
after the end of their studies, improvements were maintained and
some additional benefits could be noted, suggesting that patients
were still improving even after the end of treatment. In the
current study, in addition to the post study BDI test, no follow-up
for the participants was conducted in order to examine the longterm effect of our approach. This issue should be investigated in
the future.
As it is the case of most of the literature on the use
of neurofeedback to treat depression, which mainly represent
uncontrolled case study reports, no control group has been
considered in this pilot study. In order to quantify the benefits
of combining music and neurofeedback compared to other
approaches, ideally 3 groups should have been considered:
one group with music therapy, one group with neurofeedback,
and one group with the proposed approach combining music
therapy and neurofeedback. In this way it would have been
possible to quantify the added value of combining music therapy
and neurofeedback. However, due to the limited number of
participants this was not possible.

real-time feedback loop in which the brain activity of participants
was processed to estimate their emotional state, which in turn was
used to control an expressive rendition of the music piece. The
user’s EEG activity is mapped into a coordinate in the arousalvalence space that is fed to a pre-trained expressive music model
in order to trigger appropriate expressive transformations to a
given music piece (audio or MIDI).

Results
Seven participants completed training, requiring a total of
ten 15 min sessions (2.5 h) of neurofeedback, with no other
psychotherapy provided. There were four people who abandoned
the study toward the end of it due to health problems. Pre and
post evaluation of 6 participants was performed using the BDI
depression test (One participant was not able to respond to the
BDI depression test at the end of the treatment due to serious
health reasons). The BDI evaluation performed using the BDI
depression test, showed an average improvement of 17.2% (1.3)
in BDI scores at the end of the study. Pre–post changes on the
BDI test are shown in Figure 6.
We computed average valence and arousal values at the
beginning of the first session and the beginning of the last session
of the study. The obtained average valence values were 0.74 (0.22)
and 0.83 (0.26) for the beginning of the first session and the
beginning of the last session, respectively, while the obtained
average arousal values were 0.97 (0.14) and 0.98 (0.21) for the
beginning of the first session and the beginning of the last session,
respectively (Table 2).
Figure 7 shows the correlation within sessions between the
computed arousal and valence values, and time (1 min periods)
within sessions. For valence we obtained a correlation of r =
0.919 (p = 0.000171) while for arousal we obtained a correlation
of r = 0.315 (p = 0.375335).

Discussion

improvements in their BDI, and one patient improved from

listening may also have general effects on brain plasticity, as
the activation it causes in the brain is in both hemispheres,
and more widely distributed than that caused by verbal material
alone. In the current study, we propose a new neurofeedback
approach, which combines emotion-driven neurofeedback with
(active) music listening. In the light of the mentioned benefits
of music listening/receptive music therapy (Grocke et al.,
2007), it is reasonable to think that incorporating music
listening in a neurofeedback setting can only improve the
benefits of traditional neurofeedback systems. Furthermore, we
argue that the combination of neurofeedback and receptive
music therapy provides the benefits of both techniques, while
eliminating potential drawbacks of each separate technique.

A clinical music therapy study

In summary, we have introduced a new neurofeedback
approach, which allows users to manipulate expressive
parameters in music performances using their emotional state,
and presented the results of a neurofeedback clinical pilot study
for treating depression in elderly people. The neurofeedback
study consisted of 10 sessions (2 sessions per week) of 15 min
each initially involving 10 participants from a residential home
for the elderly in Barcelona. Participants were asked to listen
to music pieces preselected by them according to their music
preferences, and were encouraged to increase the loudness and
tempo of the pieces, based on their arousal and valence levels,
respectively: arousal was computed as beta to alpha activity
ratio in the frontal cortex, and valence was computed as relative
frontal alpha activity in the right lobe compared to the left
lobe. Pre and post evaluation of 6 participants was performed
using the BDI depression test, showing an average improvement
of 17.2% (1.3) in their BDI scores at the end of the study.
Analysis of the participants’ EEG data showed a decrease of
relative alpha activity in their left frontal lobe, which may be
interpreted as an improvement of their depression condition.
The positive results of our clinical experiment, suggest that new
research with the proposed music neurofeedback approach is
worthwhile.

receptive music therapy and neurofeedback are clear: they both
provide a noninvasive method with a lack of contraindications.
In addition, neurofeedback is oriented to encourage patients to
self-regulate their brain activity in order to promote beneficial
activity patterns, while receptive music therapy relies on the
emotional therapeutic effects of listening to music. These
positive properties of both techniques are clearly preserved
by the proposed approach. On the other hand, neurofeedback
procedures often can be tedious and consist of tasks involving
visual or auditory feedback with little or no emotional content
(e.g., moving a car on a computer screen). Furthermore, a
drawback of neurofeedback is that it is based on traditional
EEG-rhythms (e.g., theta, alpha, beta), which are functionally
heterogeneous and individual (Hammond, 2010). Receptive
music therapy methods are combined with the difficulty of
selecting music material corresponding to the individual needs of
the patient (MacDonald, 2013). These shortcomings are avoided
by the proposed system: The system provides attractive feedback
consisting of music material specially selected by the individual
participants, and it is based on high-level descriptors (i.e., arousal
and valence) representing the emotional state of users.
The results obtained in the current study seem to indicate
that music has the potential to be a useful component in
neurofeedback treatment. However, future research needs to
explore the effect of individual responses’ variables to music
through direct experimental comparison. Future investigation
of individual variables, such as music sensibility (e.g., music
experience/familiarity) and the impact of depression severity, in
addition to more stringent methodology, is required.
