Abstract

24

Background. Previous work has demonstrated that a commercial gaming

25

electroencephalography (EEG) system, Emotiv EPOC, can be adjusted to provide valid

26

auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) in adults that are comparable to ERPs recorded by a

27

research-grade EEG system, Neuroscan. The aim of the current study was to determine if the

28

same was true for children.

29

Method. An adapted Emotive EPOC system and Neuroscan system were used to make

30

simultaneous EEG recordings in nineteen 6- to 12-year-old children under “passive” and

31

“active” listening conditions. In the passive condition, children were instructed to watch a

32

silent DVD and ignore 566 standard (1000 Hz) and 100 deviant (1200 Hz) tones. In the active

33

condition, they listened to the same stimuli, and were asked to count the number of ‘high’ (i.e.

34

deviant) tones.

35

Results. Intraclass correlations (ICCs) indicated that the ERP morphology recorded with the

36

two systems was very similar for the P1, N1, P2, P2, and P3 ERP peaks (r = .78 to .95) in

37

both passive and active conditions, but was poor for the mismatch negativity ERP component

38

(MMN; r < .30). There were few differences between peak amplitude and latency estimates

39

for the two systems.

40

Conclusions. An adapted EPOC EEG system can be used to index children’s late auditory

41

ERP peaks (i.e. P1, N1, P2, N2, P3) but not their MMN ERP component.

Introduction

46

An auditory event-related potential (ERP) is the average pattern of electrical activity

47

generated by neurons in response to a particular auditory event. Auditory ERPs can be

48

measured without a listener’s overt attention. Such “passive” auditory ERPs are a useful

49

means of investigating the role of auditory processing in people who find it difficult to pay

50

attention to stimuli, to make decisions about stimuli, or plan overt responses to stimuli. Thus,

51

passive auditory ERPs have proved useful for investigating auditory processing in attention

52

deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; Taylor et al., 1997), schizophrenia (Todd, Michie &

53

Jablensky, 2003); autism (McPartland et al., 2004); developmental dyslexia (McArthur,

54

Atkinson & Ellis, 2009); and specific language impairment (Whitehouse, Barry & Bishop,

55

2008).

56

A limitation of passive auditory ERPs is that they are typically measured using

57

research-grade equipment housed in a laboratory. Such settings can be intimidating for many

58

people, particularly children and adults with cognitive disorders. Fortunately, recent research

59

has shown that a commercial “gaming” electroencephalography (EEG) system, called

60

“EPOC” by Emotiv (www.emotiv.com), can be adapted to produce valid ERPs. Badcock et

61

al. (2013) examined auditory ERPs in “passive” (standard and deviant tones are ignored) and

62

“active” (deviant tones are counted) listening conditions in adults, using an adapted EPOC

63

system and a research-grade Neuroscan system. They found high reliability for the “late

64

auditory ERP” peaks (i.e. P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3) but not for the “mismatch negativity”

65

component (MMN; see Näätänen et al., 2004). The EPOC system has also been successfully

66

used to measure the auditory P3 response (Debener et al., 2012; De Vos, Gandras & Debener,

67

2014) and the visual P3 response (Duvinage et al., 2013; De Vos et al., 2014). Considered

68

together, the outcomes of these seminal studies suggest that the EPOC system can be adapted

69

to record valid auditory P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3 ERP peaks in adults.

70

Unfortunately, no study has yet tested if an adapted EPOC system can produce valid

71

auditory ERPs in children. This cannot be inferred from previous validation studies done with

72

adults because children have (1) different ERPs to adults due to cortical and cognitive

73

immaturity (Ponton et al., 2002; Coch, Sanders & Neville, 2005; Mahajan & McArthur, 2012,

74

2013); (2) “noisier” ERPs than adults (Coch & Gullick, 2012); and (3) more difficultly

75

keeping still during long test sessions than adults, so their EEG (and ERP) responses may be

76

contaminated to a greater degree by electrical noise generated by movement. The aim of the

77

current study was to test the validity of children’s passive and active auditory ERPs measured

78

via an adapted EPOC system. In line with an analogous adult study (i.e. Badcock et al., 2013)

79

we predicted that the adapted EPOC system would produce valid ERPs for the highly reliable

80

late auditory ERP peaks (P1, N1, P2, P2, P3) but invalid ERPs for the less reliable MMN

81

component.

Materials and Methods

83

The Macquarie University Human Research Ethics Committee approved the methods used in

84

this study (approval number: 5201200658).

85

Participants

86

Participants were twenty-one children (11 females, 10 males) aged between 6 and 12 years

87

(M = 9.23, SD = 1.80). Parents or guardians of the children provided written informed

88

consent for their child’s participation, and children were reimbursed $15 for their time.

89

Participants were required to have normal hearing and vision, and no history of epilepsy. One

90

child was excluded from the study due to a reported hearing loss, and another child was

91

excluded because the EPOC event-markers failed to record. Therefore the final sample

92

included 19 children.

Stimuli

94

Presentation (Version 16; Neurobehavioural Systems) was used to deliver tones in passive

95

and active conditions (see below) at a volume that was comfortable for each participant (note:

96

the volume remained fixed across conditions). Each condition consisted of 566, 175-ms,

97

1000-Hz standard tones (10-ms rise and fall time; 85% of trials) and 100, 175-ms, 1200-Hz

98

deviant tones (10-ms rise and fall time; 15% of trials). Deviant tones were presented after 3 to

99

35 (randomly allocated) standard tones. The stimulus onset asynchrony was jittered between

PrePrints

93

100

900 and 1100 ms to minimize EEG activity related to anticipatory processes. Tones were

101

presented binaurally via Phillips SHS4700/37ear clip headphones fixed to the EPOC headset.

102

In the passive condition, participants were instructed to watch a silent movie and ignore

103

the tones presented through the headphones. In the active condition, participants were

104

instructed to count the "high" tones whilst watching the silent movie. Participants were asked,

105

and reminded where necessary, to stay as still as possible. Each condition lasted

106

approximately 13 minutes, separated by a short-break.

107

Neuroscan system

108

The research-grade EEG system (Neuroscan Version 4.3) used an EEG electrode cap

109

(EasyCap) fitted with 14 Ag-AgCl electrodes located at F3, F7, FC4, FT7, T7, P7, P8, T8,

110

FT8, FC4, F8, F4, M1 (online reference), and M2. Electrodes placed above and below the left

111

eye measured vertical eye movements (“VEOG”), and electrodes placed on the outer side of

112

each eye measured horizontal eye movements (“HEOG”). Please note that the M2 (right

113

mastoid), VEOG, and HEOG electrodes were set up as per standard procedures even though

114

these electrodes were not used in the analysis as EPOC does not provide equivalent

115

measurements. The ground electrode was positioned between FPz and Fz.

During the Neuroscan EEG recording, the EEG was sampled at 1000 Hz. Triggers were

117

inserted into the EEG to indicate the onset of each stimulus. These triggers were generated by

118

Presentation, and were inserted into the EEG via a parallel port.

119

Adapted EPOC system

120

The EPOC system used a wireless headset with flexible plastic arms that held gold-plated

121

sensors against the head at 16 sites that aligned with the research EEG headset: AF3, F7, F3,

122

FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, FC4, M1 and M2. M1 acted as a ground reference

PrePrints

116

123

point for measuring the voltage of the other sensors. M2 acted as a feed-forward reference

124

point for reducing electrical interference from external sources.

125

During recording, the EPOC EEG was sampled at 128 Hz. The onset of each stimulus

126

was marked with an electrical pulse triggered by a wireless transmission system (Thie, 2013).

127

The system consisted of transmitter and receiver units that were linked using infrared (IR)

128

light. The transmitter unit was attached to the audio output of the stimulus presentation

129

computer. The receiver unit was mounted in close proximity to the participant (i.e. taped to

130

their shoulder or resting on a table) with its output wires attached to two of the EEG

131

electrodes (O1 and O2). These electrodes were attached directly to the Driven Right Leg

132

(DRL) through wires and 4700-ohm resistors that mimicked a perfect connection with the

133

scalp. The transmitter unit was made up of a microcontroller board (Arduino Uno) and an

134

interface board. This "shield" amplified the audio stimuli and fed it to the Arduino's analogue

135

input. The receiver waited for a number from the transmitter to trigger a 100-ms-wide pulse.

136

There was a 19-ms delay (accounted for the trigger processing) between the onset of the

137

stimulus and the onset of the marker pulse due to the buffering of the audio signal in order to

138

determine its frequency and the transmission of the 8-bit number.

Procedure

140

Neuroscan was setup first and adjusted until sensor impedance was below 5 kOhms. The

141

EPOC headset was fitted over the EasyCap (for a detailed description, see Badcock et al.,

142

2013). This allowed simultaneous measurements of EEGs by the Neuroscan and EPOC

143

systems (see Fig. 1). EPOC electrode connectivity was tested using the TestBench software.

144

Sensors were adjusted until connectivity reached the “green” level, which represented

145

impendences less than 220 kOhms (measured using a resistor between an electrode and the

139

146

DRL, M2 in the current setup). The total setup time was approximately 55 minutes.

147

148

Offline EEG processing

149

Both Neuroscan and EPOC EEG recordings were processed in the same way using EEGLAB

150

version 11.0.4.3b (Delorme & Makeig, 2004). Large artefacts in each EEG were first

151

excluded by eye. The Neuroscan EEG data were then downsampled to 128 Hz in order to

152

match the sampling rate of the EPOC system. The EEG data were then bandpass filtered from

153

0.1 to 30 Hz, separated into epochs that started -102 ms before the onset of each tone and

154

ended 500 ms after the onset of each tone, and baseline corrected between -102 and 0 ms.

155

Any epochs with an amplitude in excess of +/- 150 µV were excluded.

156

Ocular artefact removal was attempted using Independent Components Analysis in

157

EEGLAB (note: channels capturing the eye-movements for Neuroscan were not included in

158

this process to maintain equivalent processing between the systems). This process failed to

159

identify any eye-blink related components for any individual dataset. Therefore eye-blinks

160

were either not consistent or strong enough to meaningfully affect the data.

161
162

For each child, the accepted epochs were averaged together to produce late auditory
ERP waveforms that comprised P1, N1, P2, and N2 peaks for the standard and deviant tones,
PeerJ PrePrints | http://dx.doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.593v1 | CC-BY 4.0 Open Access | rec: 6 Nov 2014, publ: 6 Nov 2014

in the passive and active conditions. Accepted epochs to standard and deviant tones in the

164

passive condition were averaged separately and then subtracted (i.e. the ERP to standard tones

165

was subtracted from the ERP to deviant tones) to produce a mismatch negativity (MMN)

166

waveform.

167

Analysis

168

In line with the previous EPOC validation study done with adults, the analysis focused on

169

data from frontal sites in the left and right hemispheres: F3 and F4 for Neuroscan, and AF3

PrePrints

163

170
171

and AF4 for EPOC.
The ERPs produced by the two systems were compared in three ways: (1) total

172

number of accepted epochs were used to compare the quality of the Neuroscan and EPOC

173

EEG data, (2) intraclass correlations (ICCs) were used to index the similarity of Neuroscan

174

and EPOC waveforms (between -102 to 500 ms), and (3) peak amplitude and latency

175

measures were used to compare the size and timing of each ERP peak or component. The

176

number of epochs and peak comparison data sets were tested for normality (Shapiro-Wilk)

177

and equal variance (F test). Single- and paired-sample t-tests and Wilcoxon-signed ranks and

178

were used to evaluate the statistical reliability between EEGs systems comparisons and

179

Cohen’s d was used to evaluate the magnitude of the effects. We used a criteria of p < .05

180

unless otherwise specified.

181

Regarding (3), peak amplitude and latency measures were initially calculated using an

182

automated procedure that identified the point of maximum amplitude (positive or negative)

183

within appropriate time intervals, determined by visual inspection of the relevant grand mean

184

ERP waveforms: 50 to 140 ms (P1); 70 to 140 (N1); 140 to 200 ms (P2); 260 to 400 ms (N2);

185

260 to 400 ms (P3); 140 to 260 (MMN). We then checked the validity of each peak measure

186

for each child by visually inspecting individual waveforms. This revealed that the N1 and P2

187

peaks were missing in 9 to 13 (47 to 68%) children across all condition, which is

characteristic of children’s auditory ERPs (Ponton et al., 2000; Mahajan & McArthur, 2012,

189

2013). A further 13% of the measures produced by the automated peak detection were invalid,

190

identifying an end point of the range greater in magnitude that the true peak. Invalid measures

191

were corrected manually to ensure all peak amplitude and latency measures for all children

192

were valid.

The distributions for the number of accepted epochs were negatively skewed, thus, Wilcoxon

Signed Rank Tests were used to compare the two systems. The median number of accepted

epochs, inter-quartile range, and Wilcoxon signed ranks statistics are presented in Table 1.

198

There were statistically fewer acceptable epochs for EPOC than Neuroscan in all conditions.

199

Nevertheless, the number of accepted epochs for both the EPOC and Neuroscan systems was

more than adequate for waveform generation for all participants.

F3/AF3: Z = 4.48, p < .001; F4/AF4: Z = 4.62, p < .001. These results indicate a strong

and EPOC systems are shown in Table 4. These ICCs were poor: 0.3 for F3/AF3, and 0.04 for

228

F4/AF4. Both distributions were normally distributed and single-sample t-tests determined the

229

ICC for F3/AF3 was statistically different to zero; t(18) = 3.67, p = .001; but the ICC for

230

F4/AF4 was not, t(18) = 0.47, p = .64. Thus, in contrast to the late auditory ERP waveforms,

231

the MMN waveforms were poorly comparable across the two systems.

242

P1, N1, P2, and N2

243

For the P1, N1, P2, and N2 late auditory ERP peaks, there were 11 comparisons that differed

244

statistically between the two systems. One of the differences was the N2 amplitude to the

245

standard tone, which was reduced in the EPOC system by 1.2 μVs, small in magnitude (d =

246

0.34). Ten of the differences reflected a delay in the latency of the peaks measured by the

247

EPOC system and 9 of these were evident to the standard tone. The average delay for these

248

comparisons was 7.71 ms (SD = 3.2) and effect sizes were small to large (d = 0.27 to 1.12).

249

P3

250

The differences in P3 amplitude between the systems were no significant and small (both d =

251

0.14). The P3 produced by the EPOC system at F3/AF3 was significantly later than that

252

produced by the Neuroscan system by 14 ms (see Table 5). Cohen’s d effects sizes were small

253

to moderate (d = 0.24 to 0.57).

MMN

255

The differences in MMN amplitude between the two systems was non-significant and small

256

(d = 0.21 and 0.24). The MMN latency was significantly delayed in the EPOC system by 10

257

and 16 ms (see Table 5). Cohen’s d effects sizes were small to moderate (d = 0.26 to 0.45).

Discussion

259

The aim of the current study was to assess the validity of the Emotiv EPOC gaming EEG

260

system as an auditory ERP measurement tool in children. To this end, we simultaneously

PrePrints

254

261

measured ERPs using a research-grade Neuroscan system and the EPOC system in children

262

aged between 6 and 12 years. Children were presented with standard and deviant tones in both

263

passive (ignore tones) and active (count high tones) listening conditions. The results

264

replicated the findings of Badcock et al.’s (2013) study with adults: ICCs (0.78 to 0.95)

265

revealed that the EPOC and Neuroscan systems produced similar late auditory ERP

266

waveforms in passive and active conditions at F3/AF3 and F4/AF4; and there were few

267

differences between the P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3 peak amplitudes and latencies. The few

268

differences that were found related mostly to peak latency measures, which were sometimes

269

delayed for the EPOC system. Across all of the peaks (i.e., not just those highlighted as

270

significant in the results), the average delay was 7.76 ms (SD = 5.6). This represents a single

271

sample at 128 Hz. Since this delay was small, and occurred in a minority of comparisons, we

272

do not believe it significantly compromises the use of the EPOC system as a measure of

273

auditory P1, N1, P2, N2, or P3 ERPs in children.

274

Regarding the MMN, the ICCs between the EPOC and Neuroscan waveforms were

275

found to poor (0.04 to 0.3), probably due to the poor reliability of this component (McArthur,

276

Bishop & Proudfoot, 2003; Mahajan & McArthur, 2011; Badcock et al., 2013). There was no

277

significant difference between the size of the MMN produced by the EPOC and Neuroscan

278

possibility due to sampling or transmission techniques. These results suggest that, in contrast

280

to the P1, N1, P2, N2 and P3, the Emotiv EOC system should not be used to measure the

281

MMN in children. Recent research suggests that the magnetic acoustic change complex

282

(mACC) may provide a more efficient and sensitive mechanism for investigating auditory

283

discrimination in children (Bardy et al., 2014).

285

Overall, the findings of the present study paired with Badcock et al. (2013) suggest that
EPOC compares well with Neuroscan for investigating late auditory ERPs in children. This

286

opens up new opportunities for conducting ERP studies with children with or without

287

cognitive impairments who find the laboratory settings associated with traditional research-

288

grade EEG systems threatening or uncomfortable. It also paves the way for large-scale studies

289

of the development of typical and atypical ERPs since it allows the measurement of children’s

290

ERPs in settings such as schools, childcare centres, hospitals, and private clinical practices.
