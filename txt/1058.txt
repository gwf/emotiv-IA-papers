Abstract: The synergy of perceptual psychology, technology, and neuroscience can be used to
comprehend how virtual reality affects cognition of human brain. Numerous studies have used
neuroimaging modalities to assess the cognitive state and response of the brain with various external
stimulations. The virtual reality-based devices are well known to incur visual, auditory, and haptic
induced perceptions. Neurophysiological recordings together with virtual stimulations can assist in
correlating humans’ physiological perception with response in the environment designed virtually.
The effective combination of these two has been utilized to study human behavior, spatial navigation
performance, and spatial presence, to name a few. Moreover, virtual reality-based devices can be
evaluated for the neurophysiological correlates of cognition through neurophysiological recordings.
Challenges exist in the integration of real-time neuronal signals with virtual reality-based devices,
and enhancing the experience together with real-time feedback and control through neuronal signals. This article provides an overview of neurophysiological correlates of cognition as revealed
by virtual reality experience, together with a description of perception and virtual reality-based
neuromodulation, various applications, and existing challenges in this field of research.

Perception is defined as the organization, recognition, and interpretation of sensory
information to characterize and understand the presented information or the environment.
Interaction between perceptual psychology, graphics technology, and brain sciences can be
used to understand what virtual reality (VR) does to our brains. The VR-based devices are
well known to incur dynamic audio–visually induced perceptions in humans [1].
To study the cognitive state of a person is of crucial importance in the fields of human
factors and ergonomics. A reliable measurement of the cognitive state is known to assist
in the treatment of various neuronal disorders and could also allow for enhancements in
human–machine interface designs and brain–computer interfacing (BCI) [2,3]. At present,
numerous studies have used neuroimaging modalities and their hybrid versions [4] to
assess the cognitive state, reporting the cognitive functions and responses to be associated
with event-related potentials, functional responses, and fluctuations of different frequency
bands of brain oscillations.
There are various neurophysiological data recording tools, such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
that are well known to record resting state and stimulated state brainwave activities, which
can be further quantified in different frequency bands [2]. Electrophysiological approaches

can be used as a tool to study neuro-dynamics with high temporal resolution in the order
of milliseconds, and might be used as an ensemble of biomarkers that is significantly required in the assessment of cognitive changes observed in various activities and challenge
conditions. Significant results from experimental approaches can aid in the interpretation
of the reason for the transition of a cognitive state, and tracing of the neurophysiology
behind the various activities, including VR.
Researchers are working with the approaches of BCI in the field of biomedical, education, engineering, marketing, healthcare, and gaming by blending human physiological
data, such as EEG with systems of VR [1,5–7]. These brain responses combined with
VR, enable in correlating humans’ physiological signals with their tasks in the designed
environment. Thus, the effective combination of the two has been used to study users’
cognitive states, assess and train them in navigation, investigate their perceptions, and
various other dimensions.
There are various benefits of VR-based experiments over conventional experimental instruments, such as dimensional control of the stimulus environment, providing a
more realistic protocol for the presentation and reaction of stimuli. It is known to incur
visual, auditory, and haptic induced perceptions with greater control and possibilities, and
can modulate human perception and motor performance. Simulations with VR systems
provide an enhanced and immersive experience of a sense of presence and allow for skill
improvement during VR training [8]. These systems helped researchers to study the contributions of movement-versus-outcome-related sensory feedback for the sense of agency [9].
The study of body ownership is another field where VR systems can be incorporated with
neuroimaging and utilized in the development of neuroprosthetics. Illusory perception
of virtual or missing body parts triggers motor evoked potentials and corticospinal pathways, which are of great use in the study of body ownership [10]. Visual representation of
movement is another field that can be stimulated through VR systems and the triggered
neurophysiological responses in terms of event-related potentials can assist to characterize
the neural signature of motor imagery tasks [11]. Another area is the study of sensorimotor
integration, whereby its enhancement assists in post-stroke rehabilitation, and VR systems
with multisensory stimulation help in gait rehabilitation [12].
This review discusses various approaches and applications of VR integrated neuroimaging, and provides an overview of neurophysiological correlates of VR. The article
provides insights into the efficacy of VR in diverse fields, such as neurorehabilitation and
therapy, neuromodulation, cognitive response, perception, sense of presence, spatial navigation, memory encoding and retrieval, BCI and its feedback control, and neuromarketing.
2. The Synergy of Virtual Reality and Neuroimaging
The mapping of neuronal activity using neurophysiological recordings together with
virtual reality devices is known to be a significant approach to study the alteration of
the psychobiological state of mind during VR induced dynamic perceptions. Together
with VR devices, these brain scanning modalities can be used to get comparative data of
brain response (such as power spectrum density values together with corresponding topo
maps, event-related potential, and responses) in pre-activity, activity, and post-activity
sessions of VR-based cognitive tasks. This is known to show significant alterations in
various frequency bands of neuronal oscillations [13,14]. The oscillatory signals from our
brain provide us with an impactful picture of the mental state of the person. Thus, they
could be used to study the cognitive state during perception. These neural oscillations,
also known as brain waves, have the potential to indicate the state of mind under various
stimulated and resting-state conditions. Furthermore, research is ongoing to focus on
decoding brain activity in various domains of cognition with augmented reality experience,
which provides an enhanced level of interaction with the surrounding environment [15–17].
Traditionally, neuronal oscillations can be clustered based on the frequency bands,
namely, Delta wave (<4 Hz), indicating slow-wave sleep, Theta wave (4–8 Hz), occurring
during drowsiness, Alpha wave (8–12 Hz), indicating an awakened state, Beta wave

Brain Sci. 2021, 11, 51

3 of 18

(13–30 Hz), arising only during the alert state, and Gamma wave (30–60 Hz), designating a
hyperactive state [18]. These approaches can be used as a tool to study neuro-dynamics with
high temporal resolution in the order of milliseconds and might be used as an ensemble of
biomarkers that is significantly required in the assessment of cognitive changes observed
during the use of VR-based devices.
Various neuroimaging modalities are explored by researchers in studying cognition
with the VR experience. For example, EEG was used by researchers to study the responses
evoked by the presentation of specific three-dimensional (3D) virtual tunnels with navigational images [19], and to characterize the neural generators of the brain oscillations in a
virtual tennis court, related to motor imagery [20]. Moreover, Roberts et al. [21], for the
first time, combined an optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) based MEG system with a
VR system and recorded alpha oscillations and visual evoked fields in the presence of VR
stimulations. In addition, functional imaging techniques, such as functional MRI (fMRI),
are also incorporated in VR stimulations [22–24].
Although it is crucial to understand the engineering and technological aspects of
VR, neuroscientists and neurotechnologists are keen on comprehending the synergistic
integration of VR with neuroimaging. A brief layout of this integrated approach is shown
in Figure 1. Various developed, customizable, and ready-made VR-based setups can be
used for research. These VR devices can be a head-mounted or screen-based system.
As shown in the figure, the participant is expected to wear the VR device and the neuroimaging modality is attached. The virtual environment created by the system works as a
customizable stimulus that is dynamic in audio, visual scenes, and occasionally in haptics.
The experiment constitutes a recording of data during the stimulation, following which,
it will either be processed to visualize the neural correlates, or directly integrated with the
machine, such as the BCI system. The setup provides immense possibilities for studying
the cognitive state and neuromodulation.

3. Neurophysiological Correlates of Cognition as Revealed by Virtual Reality
The study of neural signals and functional response of the brain through various neuroimaging modalities such as EEG, MEG, MRI, etc., integrated with VR environment-based
stimulation, have immense capabilities to delve into human perception, memory, cognitive
state, dysfunctions, behavior, and other aspects. Various researchers have successfully tried
to correlate the neural response in the virtually designed environment. Various approaches

Brain Sci. 2021, 11, 51

and applicability of this synergistic approach are described in this section. A brief overview
of the applicability is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. A brief overview of the applicability of VR integrated neuroimaging.

3.1. Neurorehabilitation, Neuroprosthetics, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
The study of the neural correlates of VR for therapeutic applications is an evolving field
and can assist to treat various dysfunctions. Lee et al. [25] utilized VR-based therapy with
multisensory stimulation to reduce the craving for alcohol. The therapy consisted of a series
of scenes associated with virtual alcohol cues, relaxation, and aversive stimulation. The VR
goggle-based experiment, which included the selection of a type of alcoholic beverage and
drinking situation to view during the high-risk situation, together with EEG recording from
19 monopolar electrode sites, showed an increase in alpha activity in the frontal region
after the 10th session, together with a decrease in craving for alcohol in alcohol-dependent
patients. Customized VR scenes with multisensory modes of stimulation showed improved
therapeutic efficacy than traditional cognitive therapy. Similarly, Moon et al. [26] worked
with an fMRI-based experiment in a virtual environment with cue exposure treatment to
reduce the craving for nicotine.
Functional neuroimaging using fMRI together with VR can be used to reveal the
underlying neural correlates of motor functions in neurodegenerative diseases, such as
freezing behavior in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Sine et al. [27] demonstrated a real-time VRbased walking task, both, with and without dopaminergic medication observed with fMRI.
Freezing behavior was provoked by this VR-based stimulation method and distinct Bloodoxygen-level dependent (BOLD) patterns were observed during walking and episodes
of freezing. The distinct pattern of activation and deactivation underlying the freezing
sensation is shown in Figure 3.
It is observed that VR-based setups can be used in neurorehabilitation by inducing
motor function recovery, especially in stroke patients. EEG oscillations can be used to
analyze the neurophysiological correlates of motor function recovery induced by roboticassisted gait training device together with VR scenes, as described by Calabro et al. [28].
It was observed that high-γ and β bands had stronger event-related spectral perturbations
together with large frontocentral cortical activations in the affected hemisphere (shown
in Figure 4). It was demonstrated that the robotics-based rehabilitation system combined
with VR entrained several brain areas and stronger cortical activations were observed,
due to VR feedback, in the fronto-parieto-occipital areas, probably referring to the mirror
neuro system. August et al. [29] demonstrated the possibility of activating primary and
secondary motor areas through VR-based hand exercise, which was useful for stroke
patients. Similarly, Steinisch et al. [30] worked on neuro motor rehabilitation of the upper

Brain Sci. 2021, 11, 51

limb in stroke patients. They tried to integrate robotics, VR system, and EEG recording to
train the participants with distinct movement patterns of the upper limb, through a VR
training application. They used a passive robotic device for kinematic tracking together
with compensation of gravity. The proposed system was demonstrated as a potential
rehabilitation system for monitoring neuro-motor recovery.

with VR based method. (A) Whole brain statistical parametric mapping (SPM) maps showing cortical activation pattern

pre-supplementary areas, the motor cortices, dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices, as well as posterior parietal
regions. In contrast, there was marked bilateral deactivation of the frontopolar cortices and the precuneus. Upper left corner:

Goncalves et al. [31] experimented with upper limb stroke patients using VR therapy
with a Computed tomography (CT) scan, as an interactive intervention to induce neuroplasticity. Pre-and post-VR therapy sessions were compared and to study the relationship
between the lesion and upper limb function, a voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping
approach was used. It was observed that the functionality and ability of the upper limb
improved after the therapy.
Merians et al. [32] developed a hand and arm training system with interactive virtual
environments for stroke patients, which can assist in the activation of brain areas through
visual feedback. They predicted using fMRI results that the visual augmentation can assist
to facilitate functional neuroplasticity. Prochnow et al. [33] worked with a rehabilitation
gaming system with stroke patients and demonstrated through fMRI data that recovery
is possible through object processing, attention, and mirror neuron system involvement.
The fMRI results showed that virtual target catching can activate frontal, parietal, temporal,
cingulate, and cerebellar regions. Similarly, Xiao et al. [34] performed a preliminary study
with subacute stroke survivors using a virtual reality-enhanced treadmill. The fMRI results
for ankle dorsiflexion activity showed increased activation in the primary sensorimotor
cortex of the lesioned hemisphere and supplementary motor areas of both sides for the
paretic foot, after the intervention. This led to improved walking and cortical activation.

Various experiments helpful in neuroprosthetics and motor control and coordination
activity can be also performed with the use of VR systems. For example, Bach et al. [35]
developed and experimented with an MRI-compatible VR-based setup that can trigger
illusory sensations with visual and tactile stimulations. The experiment demonstrated
the fMRI response acquisition with illusory ownership experiences for a virtual limb.
A highly susceptible subject was noted to show experience of ownership accompanied
by the bilateral activity of ventral premotor cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex,
extrastriate visual cortex, as well as right-hemispheric activation of the cerebellum.
Menon et al. [36] developed an MRI-compatible system that can stimulate haptic interaction in an immersive virtual world. The device is useful in studying the correlates of
neuromuscular control experiments involving interactive motor tasks, tactile perception,
and visuomotor integration activities.
Moreover, VR stimulated neuroimaging can be utilized for cognitive behavioral therapy. Attention enhancement is one field where this synergistic approach is increasingly
experimented on. Cho et al. [37] developed a VR-based attention enhancement system,
integrated with EEG biofeedback. The study was based on EEG biofeedback treatment for
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), using Beta wave as feedback control, and
showed significant results in attention enhancement.
3.2. Neuromodulation and Cognitive State
Neuromodulation through activities, such as meditation, is also possible through VR
based devices. Choo et al. [38] used a gamification approach to develop software that
can provide immersive virtual environments with guided meditation tracks for mindfulness activities, and supports EEG data acquisition to study the mental state of the person.
They used a point system, “Serenity”, in the virtual system as a reward for mindfully
meditating with the software and maintaining user interest in meditation. The software
contained mindfulness scenes of realistically rendered and animated locales, such as
Angkor Wat, with different meditation lessons. Emotiv EEG headset was used, which directly tracks the meditation score as well as other affective states. However, the experiment
did not discuss the EEG data.

Brain Sci. 2021, 11, 51

Driver cognitive response is also an area where researchers are experimenting with VRbased dynamic environment, together with neuroimaging, to study accidents. Lin et al. [39]
worked with kinetic audiovisual stimuli delivering a VR device that can perform trafficlight motion simulation. The EEG signals were recorded and through Independent component analysis (ICA), noise-free Event-Related Potential (ERP) signals were obtained,
which were further processed with a self-constructing neural fuzzy inference network,
recognizing different brain potentials corresponding to red/green/yellow traffic events,
and describing the cognitive state and response to task events. It showed that multiple
streams of ERP signals represent operators’ cognitive states and responses to task events.
Silva et al. [40] experimented to study the response of the brain with changes in motion
speed of a non-immersive 3D virtual stimulus. The visual-time reproduction task was
varied at three-speed conditions and EEG data analysis showing theta band power in the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, was observed. In all three-speed conditions, increased EEG
theta power in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, was observed, which was related to
the accumulation of temporal pulses, further relating to attention and memory.
3.3. Perception
Perception is defined as the process of organization, identification, and interpretation
of sensory information to perceive the environment. Visual perception is known to involve
the sensorimotor system of the brain and VR-based setups can modulate neural oscillations
and reveal the underlying process. Neural oscillation, which can be monitored with
neurophysiological recordings, can assist to understand the correlates of perception.
Visual space is known to accompany a series of perceptual thresholds with functional
sub-divisions and thus linked to behavior. Neuroimaging studies expose that visual
perception of manipulable objects is related to motor capacities. Wamain et al. [14] studied
the process of motor coding of visual objects in peripersonal space. The centro-parietal
region was studied while perceptually judging the intrinsic or extrinsic properties of visual
objects. The desynchronization of Mu rhythm was observed 300 ms after the object was
presented. The results indicated that motor coding was dependent on the goal of the
perceptual task.
The neural correlates of auditory distance perception are of interest to researchers.
The spatial attributes are known to be correlated with the recognition of acoustic patterns.
Mathiak et al. [41] tried to understand the neural mechanisms of auditory distance perception using MEG signals as variations in amplitude over both supratemporal planes. Hemispheric lateralization was indicated by enhanced pre-attentive responses over the right
temporal lobe. It shows that the pre-attentive neuronal basis of amplitude discrimination is
selective to spatial encoding. This helped to understand the temporal multisensory matrix
that promotes the integration of spatial information across visual and auditory modalities.
Cheetham et al. [42] partially replicated Milgram’s obedience paradigm in VR in which,
a virtual female was pained by the participant while observing her suffering. The eventrelated fMRI data was acquired and studied during the observation of pain, which showed
a distinct pattern of brain response with pain-related behaviors together with an aversive
state of personal distress (Figure 5).

in pain. Observing the avatar in pain compared with no pain-evoked differences in brain activation
in the right amygdala and periamygdala areas (A), Inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)-Brodmann’s area (BA
47, BA44) (B), and bilateral rostral prefrontal cortex (rPFC) (C). Images are superimposed on the
coronal and sagittal sections of the single subject structural Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI),

3.4. Sense of Presence
Sense of presence in virtual environments is defined by an experience that provides
a perception of being in a different environment than the actual. Studying the neural
correlates of the sense of presence is of particular importance to researchers. Neural
correlates of spatial presence can be studied with a combination of VR and EEG setup
as performed by Baumgartner et al. [43], with virtual roller coaster scenarios. Besides,
they used psychophysiological and psychometric measures to understand the responses.
The results showed that in adolescents, activation increases in prefrontal areas, which are
involved in the control of executive functions. However, in children, a decrease in activity
was observed, which implies that frontal cortex functions are not fully developed in them.
Slobounov et al. [44] compared EEG correlates of a fully immersive 3D scene of spatial
navigation with a 2D version and found that 3D needs a higher subjective sense of presence
with the allocation of more brain and sensory resources.
Kober and Neuper [45] assessed the presence of participants in VR using auditory
event-related potentials of the EEG in a virtual city. They observed that decreasing late
negative slow wave amplitudes corresponded to increased presence experience. It was associated with central stimulus processing and allocation of attentional resources, and frontal
negative slow waves thus were able to accurately predict the presence.
3.5. Spatial Navigation and Memory
Neural correlates of spatial navigation and memory-based experiments can be performed by combining VR with neuroimaging studies. Kober et al. [13] analyzed theta
oscillations with EEG recording during spatial navigation in virtual environments, with
a virtual maze. They observed absolute band power and event-related desynchronization/synchronization to see sex differences and reported that in the processing of navigational aid as landmarks, females showed stronger theta oscillations than men, which
can indicate that females may have stronger sensorimotor integration. Similarly, Clemente
et al. [46] studied the navigation control with VR-based stimulations, for which they observed the EEG activity of the right Insula for the theta band oscillation. They performed a

Brain Sci. 2021, 11, 51

9 of 18

free navigation experiment in a virtual environment, which was compared with video and
photographs. They observed a significant difference between the navigation and video
conditions in the right Insula activity for theta band oscillation, which is associated with
stimulus attention and self-awareness processes.
Slobounov et al. [47] worked with 15 athletes having a mild traumatic brain injury, with a paradigm of the navigable virtual corridor. The BOLD response showed
that concussed subjects have larger cluster sizes during encoding at the parietal cortex,
right hippocampus, and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Hung et al. [48] observed
a compromised speed control during basic driving conditions in cerebellum-damaged
drivers. They used fMRI with VR-based driving simulator and studied motor-speed coordination in basic driving maneuvers. They observed a significant negative correlation
between the mean cerebellar activation and the average time to complete right turns,
which shows compromised motor coordination.
Ehinger et al. [49] observed a modulated alpha activity in spatial navigation due to
kinesthetic and vestibular information, which was provided through a VR system in which
the subject was traversing on a triangular path. Through EEG data, they observed an
alpha suppression during turning movement, in parietal, occipital, and temporal clusters.
This shows an increased requirement of visuo-attentional processing, thus exposing the
neural correlates of spatial navigation. Araujo et al. [50] used MEG with VR-based navigation in town and studied the alpha and theta band activity. During navigation tasks,
theta power was observed as strongest but, during control, no consistent increase in theta
power was observed (as shown in Figure 6), thus showing a link between navigation and
theta activity.

Figure 6. Time–frequency analysis of the magnetoencephalography (MEG) from a representative
subject. (a–d) The graphs show the data parsed into epochs. Notice that Epochs 1 and 3 are dominated
by alpha (a,c), whereas Epochs 2 and 4, corresponding to periods of navigation, are dominated by
theta (b,d). All rights reserved, with permission from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The approach has applicability in performing memory-based experiments also.
Jaiswal et al. [51] used a VR setup and observed modulation in EEG signals to compare encoding with the retrieval of visual-spatial information in working memory. The VR system
provided a virtual corridor, with a sense of presence to the subjects, in which, they were

Brain Sci. 2021, 11, 51

10 of 18

able to freely navigate using their right thumb in multiple directions. They observed that
theta activity increased during encoding when compared with the retrieval process (as
shown in Figure 7). Further, the alpha activity was found to be significantly higher for
retrieval than in the encoding process. This implied that more cerebral effort is required in
the encoding of working memory than in retrieval.

Figure 7. Brain maps showing topographical distribution of theta and alpha power during free
navigation, baseline, encoding, and retrieval of visual–spatial working memory task. (A) brain map
showing increase in theta power in right frontal and frontal central region during encoding and
free navigation as compared to retrieval. When encoding is compared with baseline, the increase
is again significant in right frontal brain region. Another point of interest is higher theta power
at frontal central areas during free navigation as compared to retrieval. (B) brain map showing a
significant increase in alpha power in all the regions during baseline in comparison to encoding and
retrieval. When comparing encoding and retrieval, alpha power is slightly higher during retrieval
at right parietal, left central and left, and right occipital brain regions. When comparing retrieval
and free navigation, alpha power is reduced at occipital areas. Overall, both encoding and retrieval
attenuate alpha power at all regions of interest (ROI). Adapted from brain research Jaiswal, N., Ray,
W., and Slobounov, S. (2010). Encoding of visual–spatial information in working memory requires
more cerebral efforts than retrieval: Evidence from an EEG and virtual reality study, 1347, 80–89.

3.6. BCI and Feedback Control
Various BCI experiments can be performed with VR devices clubbed with neuroimaging modalities, such as EEG. Pfurtscheller et al. [52] worked with a BCI system in which
moving objects were presented through VR and EEG was used to study the dynamics of
sensorimotor rhythms. They presented 3D moving objects (hand and cube) and noted
that a stronger desynchronization of the central beta rhythm is present in moving hand,
in comparison to moving cube, inferring that the type of object matters in neural processing. Moreover, it may suggest a greater involvement of motor areas in processing
body parts-based objects than others. Figure 8 shows the corresponding Event-related
de-synchronization/Event-related synchronization (ERD/ERS) time-frequency maps.

during static and dynamic hand presentation and a further beta ERD only during observation of hand movement. All rights

In BCI, feedback is an important component, and VR tools can improve the BCIfeedback presentation. Ron-Angevin and Díaz-Estrella [53] explored this function and
trained subjects using the BCI system with a virtual environment. This helped to modify
EEG behavior through improvement in feedback control. Similarly, Othmer et al. [54]
worked for the implementation of EEG biofeedback with VR-based stimulation in subjects
with neurological disorders. Zarka et al. [55] researched the time course of scalp activation during observation of human gait with EEG and human walking 3D-animation in
normal, upside down, and uncoordinated conditions. They observed a decreased P120
response in the upside-down condition and a decreased N170 and P300b amplitude in the
uncoordinated condition, together with decreased alpha power and theta phase locking
in both conditions. The results were in agreement with the various existing point-light
display studies; thus, supporting the application of VR for neurofeedback. Vourvopoulos
et al. [6] utilized VR-based BCI neurofeedback for stroke patient rehabilitation, for which
they used a platform that can acquire post-stroke EEG signals with function of movement
of a virtual avatar arm, which allowed a subject-driven action observation neurofeedback
in VR. The results showed that EEG based neurofeedback is beneficial for severe motor
impairment patients.
However, various neurotechnological advancements, such as an enhanced compatibility with the full functionality of VR systems with neuroimaging modalities (such as fMRI
and MEG), enhanced the degree of freedom for mobility in an integrated system; hybrid
neuroimaging with VR stimulations, etc. are yet to be researched, which can provide a
robust system of integrated VR environment and BCI systems.
3.7. Neuromarketing
Neuromarketing involves the implication of neuropsychology in marketing research
to assess the neural responses from the subject for marketing stimuli [56,57]. The addition
of VR technologies can give an extra edge to neuromarketing by providing a virtual

Brain Sci. 2021, 11, 51

12 of 18

environment to show marketing creativity. Burris et al. [58] contributed an article describing
the applicability of an integrated VR-neuroimaging system in neuromarketing. The chapter
provided an overview of various means of studying human neurological responses with
VR stimulated marketing environment, through neuroimaging modalities such as EEG,
MEG, and fMRI. Castellanos et al. [59] explored the neuromarketing approach in digital
video advertising with EEG measurements. It consisted of interactive videos shown on
the 360◦ screen followed by a questionnaire. The study evaluated the effect of interactivity
in emotion during the viewing of the advertisements. The power spectral density (PSD)
values of all frequency bands were computed for the 360◦ video stimulations. The frontal
asymmetry index and difference score to summarize relative activity at homologous right
and left sites, were calculated, and difference scores were averaged. A larger index of
frontal asymmetry was observed for the 360◦ Group in comparison to the non 360◦ group.
Thus, immersive, and interactive features of a 360◦ advertisement were found to enhance
the emotional responses of valence.
However, the application of VR systems in neuromarketing needs further research to
understand the vibrant perspective of marketing approaches and associated
neural correlates.
3.8. Other Fields
Dynamic stimulations with VR can mimic a haptic environment and can be utilized
to study various sensations, such as motion sickness. Lin et al. [60] worked with a dynamic VR environment consisting of a 3D surrounding VR scene and a motion platform.
Sickness levels were studied using EEG signals with independent component analysis and
it was observed that in the parietal and motor areas, power of 8–10 Hz frequency band
increased with motion sickness-related events. This helped to assess the neural correlates
of motion sickness.
VR can be used to study depression and its neural correlates. Depression is sometimes
envisaged to be a result of the dysfunctional hippocampus, and this can be studied using
MEG scans with VR navigation tasks, as experimented by Cornwell et al. [61]. The subjects
were asked to navigate a virtual Morris water maze to find a hidden platform and theta
oscillations (4–8 Hz) were mapped across the brain. Dysfunction of the right anterior
hippocampus and para- hippocampal cortices were indicated as the reason for depression due to observation of the comparative differences in theta activity in right medial
temporal cortices.
In addition, researchers have been trying to induce a hypnotic effect through VR
systems. White et al. [62] studied the effect of hypnosis induced by a VR hypnosis induction system, by investigating EEG-based coherence and power spectra changes. The VR
system consisted of a spoken hypnotic induction system with instructions to relax and
was presented with scenes and sounds in the background. A decrease in incoherence was
observed in the high susceptibility group while an increase in coherence was noted in the
low susceptibility group, between medial frontal and lateral left prefrontal sites.
These discussed approaches and applicability in multidimensional fields show the
efficacy of VR based research together with deciphering the neuronal response. Table 1
provides an overview of the discussed research, showing the synergistic relation and
applicability of VR systems in neuroimaging research.

4. Limitations and Future Perspective
There is a significant and considerable difference between VR and actual reality,
which is due to the factors of perception and human sense. The present VR devices
lack intensive immerse experience up to the level of actual reality, and research studies
and technology firms lack a quantifiable dataset to describe and measure this difference.

Moreover, the complete and integrated virtual experience is lacking a perfect association of
environmental and stimulation factors, including, audiovisual dynamics, haptics, and other
sensory input. Furthermore, the neuronal response from the brain as sensory feedback
is not yet completely integrated with VR-based devices, which can provide a complete
solution to various real-life scenarios. In addition, research is lacking on studying and
quantifying how much reality we have achieved in these VR devices. There is a requirement
to develop new approaches and quantify the perception of reality in VR devices, and to
develop tools for quantification of reality in VR devices based on neural correlates and
responses. Approaches that can assist in integrating neuronal signals for real-time feedback,
and control and enhance the VR experience are also required. These technical issues are
getting the attention of researchers and are expected to be developed and advanced in the
near future.
5. Conclusions
This article presented an overview of the synergistic integration of VR-based systems
with neuroimaging modalities and explained their integration approach. The current evidence from research shows that VR-based environment creation can be utilized to perform
various experiments from different fields of cognitive sciences, engineering, and biomedical
engineering, and sciences. It has immense applicability and efficacy and can provide an
insight into the functioning of the brain in response to dynamic stimuli. An overview of various experiments having applications in neurorehabilitation and therapy, neuromodulation,
cognition, perception, navigation, memory encoding and retrieval, BCI, and in emerging
fields, such as neuromarketing, is provided in this review, which will help researchers to
explore further possibilities and do technological advancements in this multidisciplinary
field. Furthermore, there is a need to work on the discussed limitations and perform
potential research in other fields, such as social interaction and neurotechnology, together
with the development of a fully functional industrial applicability.
