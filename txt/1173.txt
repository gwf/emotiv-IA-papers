Abstract
Many endogenous and external components may affect the physiological, mental and behavioral states in humans.
Monitoring tools are required to evaluate biomarkers, identify biological events, and predict their outcomes. Being
one of the valuable indicators, brain biomarkers derived from temporal or spectral electroencephalography (EEG)
signals processing, allow for the classification of mental disorders and mental tasks. An EEG signal has a nonstationary nature and individual frequency feature, hence it can be concluded that each subject has peculiar timing
and data to extract unique features. In order to classify data, which are collected by performing four mental task
(reciting the alphabet backwards, imagination of rotation of a cube, imagination of right hand movements
(open/close) and performing mathematical operations), discriminative features were extracted using four
competitive time-frequency techniques; Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), Morlet Wavelet Transform
(MWT), Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Wavelet Filter Bank (WFB), respectively. The extracted
features using both time and frequency domain information were then reduced using a principal component analysis
for subset reduction. Finally, the reduced subsets were fed into a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MP-NN)
trained with back propagation (BP) algorithm to generate a predictive model. This study mainly focuses on
comparing the relative performance of time-frequency feature extraction methods that are used to classify mental
tasks. The real-time (RT) conducted experimental results underlined that the WPD feature extraction method
outperforms with 92% classification accuracy compared to three other aforementioned methods for four different
mental tasks.

therefore, it should be analyzed the variations of a signal

Time-frequency feature extraction methods are
investigated to extract features for classification of
mental tasks. Four time-frequency based feature
extraction methods to examine the dominant frequency
band and timing in EEG signals are proposed and

1. Introduction
Biomarkers are valuable parameters derived from
biological systems which could be grouped into two
categories. The first group is called as “structural”
biomarkers that are extracted from physiological
structures and principally defined at the genetic and/or
molecular level while the second group, “functional”, is
related to continuous measurements of body function
throughout time to track physiological, mental and
behavioral states. Other important subgroup of
functional biomarkers includes status measurements of
brain functions to monitor and interpret neural activity,

operations. Following the feature extraction process,
since non-linear classification methods outperform
compared to linear approaches for non-linear systems
[3], NN method to dichotomize the mental tasks were
attached. Besides, prior to feature extraction step, due to
high-dimensional characteristics of the EEG signals and
possible accompanying artificial noise, a filtering
procedure were applied. The remaining of the paper is
organized as follows: In section 1, related studies are
underlined, In section 3, four different feature extraction
methods, WPD, MWT, STFT, and WFB are studied.

classification accuracy for all mental tasks to be used in
BCI applications [15, 16]. The higher frequency
components, which store valuable information of the
signal, can only be observed in the WPD, which allows
wavelet detail components to be divided into its own
approximation and detail components [5, 13, 17-20]. In
another study, a BCI based on using EEG signals
associated with three arm movements for controlling
robotic arm was designed and WT was used and
performed with 91.1% classification rate with a MPNN. A multi-mental task classification based BCI was
designed in [21] and the majority of classification errors
are below 30% for recognizing EEG signals. Supervised
classification methods were utilized to discriminate the
EEG activity patterns to learn the mapping between
EEG data and EEG classes corresponding to mental
tasks in [22], where the best classification accuracy was
85.71% with a sigmoid transfer function, 0.1 learning
rate and 0.2 momentum rate. A WPD based timefrequency approach were developed to classify motor
imagery tasks, and reached an averaged classification of
78% in nine human subjects [23]. Comparison of
performances by five NN training methods to classify
five mental states, and the relevant frequency bands
from EEG were studied in [24] and 90% accuracy was
obtained with resilient BP algorithm. The classification
results of SVM classifiers indicate that it is suitable for
imagined motor and cognitive classification. Classifier
performances of better than 80% for six imagined motor
tasks, and for two affective tasks were achieved. Three
cognitive tasks were successfully classified with 70%
accuracy using wavelet features in [25]. Multi signal
WPD based parameters could also be used as valuable
features in RT EEG applications.

2. Related Studies
Recent studies focus on the applications combining
EEG and brain-computer interface (BCI). For example,
mental tasks with speech imagery were extracted and
classified by common spatial patterns (CSP) and
support vector machine (SVM) with 82.3%
classification accuracy in a study [4]. Motor imagery
EEG signal processing were introduced by utilizing
wavelet transformation (WT) under different
classification performances varied between 78.5%90.1% in [5]. A classification rate of about 80% was
achieved using WPD based independent component
analysis (ICA) in motor imagery of lower limb action in
another study [6]. Wavelet NN models with various
activation functions and different feature extraction
techniques were analyzed in the task of epileptic seizure
classification with high classification rates over 90% in
[7]. Wavelet multi-resolution analysis was also
performed to extract the various sub-bands of the raw
EEG signal for the analysis of event related potentials in
a study [8]. Left and right hand imagery movements
were identified using STFT [9]. Comparison methods
such as the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and
STFT were examined in detail [10]. A wavelet-packetbased algorithm were conducted for the extraction of
neural rhythms [11]. Several cognitive tasks such as text
reading, mathematical problem solving, watching
videos etc. were also investigated in the sense of
classification via DWT and principal component
analysis (PCA), SVM with 86.09% accuracy [12, 13]. In
[14], a multi-class filter bank CSP for four class motor
imagery BCI was implemented to find a strong
discriminative time-frequency based feature extraction
method,

3. Materials and Methods
In this study, feature extraction, feature reduction and
classification approaches have been applied to raw EEG
data respectively. Later, generated model was tested
using simulations and RT experiments. No prior study
has been carried out combining aforementioned
methods to make a RT trajectory tracking application.
The aforementioned steps are designed considering the
given flow chart given in figure 1.

Emotiv EPOC wireless EEG headset was used to collect
data. Matlab R2017a was used for data processing and
BCI design steps on Intel Core i7, 8 GB memory
configuration hardware running with Windows 7 OS.

MW is a complex wave, which is composed with a
normalization factor, complex sinusoid and a Gaussian
bell curve envelope [28]. It gives a result of complex
coefficient values, which consist of an imaginary and
real part, after applying the MWT on a signal. From a
computational view point, complex time-domain
convolutions perform lack of efficiency. Therefore,
power spectral density (PSD) is utilized to reveal the
frequency domain response [29].

3.1. Feature Extraction Methods in EEG Signals
Various time-frequency methods are used for feature
extraction. Time-frequency methods analyze timevarying spectral properties of the non-stationary signals.
In this section, STFT, WFB, WPD and MWT methods
will be presented in details.
3.1.1.

3.1.3. The Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD)
In EEG signal analysis, the components related to highfrequencies are strictly spaced in time domain, while the
components related to low-frequencies are strictly
spaced in frequency domain. Wavelets provide a way to
analyze this type of signals both in time and frequency
domains with a good frequency resolution along with
finite time resolution by localizing the low frequency
components and resolving high frequency components,
respectively [28, 29]. The WPD can be modeled as a
tree of subspaces. Ω0,0 shows the root of the signal
space. The node Ωr,q with r standing for the scale and q
correlating the sub-band index within the scale is
decomposed into two orthogonal subspaces; an
approximation space Ωr,q ⟶ Ωr+1,2q and a detailed
space Ωr,q ⟶ Ωr+1,2q+1 [30]. The orthogonal basis
{ϕr (t − 2r q)}q∈Z of Ωr,q were break down into two
new orthogonal bases {𝜙𝑟+1 (𝑡 − 2𝑟+1 𝑞)}𝑞∈𝑍 of Ωr+1,2q
and {ψr+1 (t − 2r+1 q)}q∈Z of Ωr+1,2q+1 where ϕr,q (t)
and ψr,q (t) are the scaling and wavelet functions are
represented in [31] as in Eq. (4).

Short – Time Fourier Transform (STFT)

Basically, STFT extracts several frames of the original
signal to be analyzed with a window frame that shifts
with time. If the time window utilized, is narrow
enough, each frame extracted could be evaluated as
stationary which enables using Fourier transform (FT)
[2]. STFT calculates a time-varying spectrum by
implementing the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to a
framed part of the data and by moving the frame
through the whole record. With this approach, the
spectral characteristics are processed as constant for
each constant frame time, but catches the switches in the
spectral characteristics using various, possibly
overlapping, frame locations throughout the time. The
magnitude squared of STFT yields the spectrogram of
the function. STFT spectrogram is the normalized,
squared magnitude of the STFT coefficients produced
by the STFT [26]. Supposing x(n) a nonstationary EEG
signal, STFT is applied to the EEG signal as in Eq. (1).

3.1.2. Morlet Wavelet Transform (MWT)
Morlet wavelet (MW) is a form of continuous WT,
which discriminate the phase and the amplitude
elements of the signal. Thus it can be analyzed with this
approach the alpha and beta frequency bands in the
time-spectral domain. The theoretical background of the
MW has been mentioned in the textbooks [27, 28]. The
function of the Morlet wavelet ψ(t) is called as Gabor
wavelet, which is given by [29] as in Eq.(3)

Where 2 is known as the scaling parameter, 2 q is also
known as translation parameter, which resolves the time
location of the wavelet. The original signal can be
analyzed in the selected time and frequency span [32,
33]. The feature vector of the signals, which are
collected from each electrode channel has been
obtained. The decomposition level is 7. The tree has 127
(2N-1) feature vector, where N=7 nodes in total. Since
Daubechies wavelet family provides robust performance
[33, 34], the main wavelet was selected as Daubechies2. The pruning search algorithm and log-energy cost
function was used.

Here ψ(n) represents the windowing function. STFT
shows the FT of the local windowed signal splitted in
time domain and also represents frequency part of time
variation. A spectrogram is defined as in Eq. (2).

3.1.4. Wavelet Filter Bank (WFB)
DWT produces wave from a signal and these waves can
also be utilized to re-construct the signal again. There
are produced two sets of function at each step of DWT
decomposition referred as scaling coefficients
x k+1 (n) and the wavelet coefficients y k+1 (n). These
coefficients are given in Eq. (5) [35].

Since the noise is a disturbing factor imported from
various sources to the EEG signal, application of signal
pre-processing step is vital to maximize the signal tonoise ratio (SNR). The noise could imported from nonneural sources or even from neural such as EEG
features excluding the biomarkers. Notch filters with
their null frequency of 50 Hz are employed to remove
the strong power supply impact. On the other hand the
use of a high-pass filters with a cut-off frequency lower
than 0.3 Hz is employed to reject the disturbance effect
of very low frequency components such as breathing.
Besides, high-frequency noise is also extenuated via
using low-pass filters with a cut-off frequency of 40 Hz.
For eye-movement and muscular artifacts, various
filters were used to remove the intervention of this kind
of possible artifacts [40]. In our study, EEG signals
collected from the subjects were first filtered using
band-pass filter between 0,5 and 45 Hz with a 6th-order
Butterworth band-pass filter to eliminate the artifacts.
Since in electrophysiology commonly Butterworth and
elliptic Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters are
employed widely [41] and recent studies [42-44]
underline the performance of Butterworth filters, it was
applied in our study for pre-processing step. Besides,
ICA is also another tool used to remove the artifacts
caused by external stimuli. Due to its contribution to
EEG source separation, pre-processing tools have been
successfully implemented to EEG research to reduce
EEG artifact, enhance the SNR of task-related EEG
signals, and facilitate EEG source localization [45, 46].
Therefore, the utilization of a pre-processing step should
be considered before initializing the classification
process that is mostly achieved by taking the amplitude
of pre-processed EEG time points as features, with lowpass or band-pass filtering and down-sampling as preprocessing. EEG data generally consist of main signal
with additive noise, which is sufficiently different in
frequency content from the signal. Non-neural
physiological activities such as skin/sweat potentials
should be removed to work on a noise-free signal,
which is significant to reduce the execution time but
increasing memory utilization [47].

The original signal is performed by x 0 (n), while k is the
scaling coefficient. DWT decomposes the original
signal into sub-band frequency components by applying
filtering process at each level of decomposition. The
decomposition is made by using successive low-pass
and high-pass filters [36]. Here g(n) and
h(n) represents the low pass and high pass filters. The
input of the next level decomposition, named as
approximation coefficients is the output of the scaling
function. The high-pass filter coefficients are related to
any decomposed signal as detail coefficients. The lowpass filter is associated as scaling function, while highpass filter is associated as wavelet function. These
relationships can be constructed as in Eq. (7) [37].

Filter banks are used to produce orthogonal sets of
wavelets that illustrates orthogonality characteristic on
the subject of the even shifts [38].
3.2. Signal Acquisition
Ten able-bodied volunteers took part on the
experiments. The volunteers were healthy and middleaged. Before conducting the tests, the volunteers
performed previous training sessions to increase their
concentrations. EEG signals were measured when a
subject is sitting in a chair. The EEG electrodes
embedded in the neuro-headset are positioned according
to the “International 10-20 method of placement”. EEG
data were collected using “EMOTIV EPOC” neuroheadset that enables recording EEG signals from 14
channels of the headset (AF3-F7-F3-FC5-T7-P7-O1O2-P8-T8-FC6-F4-F8-AF4), and also trace the power of
the four main brain frequency bands [39] of signal using
FFT. The neuro-headset collects samples from 14
channels with 128 samples/second. Simulink-EEG
Importer was used for data recording process, which
also communicates with "Matlab & Simulink" software.
EEG data was collected from neuro-headset with the
interface and transferred to "Matlab & Simulink"
platform. While performing mental task classification,
training and testing data were collected first for 10
seconds for each task. The sessions were repeated 40
times for training and 10 times for testing processes.
Totally, 14x1600 train, 14x400 test data were collected
for 4 mental tasks from 14 channels.

4. Results and Evaluation
After applying the filtering and WPD, a valuable feature
is to be determined. The dimension of the input training
matrix and input test matrix for each feature was set as
14x1600 and 14x400 before the training process.
MPNN trained by a standard BP algorithm, which uses
the gradient steepest descent method to train the
parameters of the network, was implemented later for

classification. Nevertheless, the error curve may
converge very slowly or the solution may fall into local
minima at the end of the training process. Since there
are 14 electrodes and approximately 18 features from
each electrode, 250 neurons were assigned first but
observed that the accuracy was better for 190 neurons
for the hidden layer. As far as the learning rate is
concerned, it is an important factor to control the
gradient descent and to find an optimal learning rate. A
small learning rate affects the convergence speed and
the training may take much longer time than with a
higher learning rate. A large learning rate may help the
network escape from local minima, but the NN may go
through a large oscillations and may never converge
[48]. It was also explored that the values from “0.001”
to “0.25”, namely “0.001, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1” and “0.25” as
the various values of learning rate, and the optimal
results were achieved with the learning rate of “0.03”.
The results are given in table 1.

we drastically reduce the number of sample sets which
could be used for learning the model, and the results
could depend on a particular random choice for train,
validation sets. A valuable solution to this problem is
cross-validation (CV). Basically, with k-fold CV the
whole dataset is employed efficiently. A test set is still
held out for final evaluation, but the validation set is no
longer needed for CV. The training dataset is split
into k smaller sets, the model is trained using k-1 of the
folds as training data and then the resulting model is
validated on the remaining data in order to compute a
performance measure such as accuracy. This approach
could be computationally expensive, but values the
dataset is very small [49]. In this study, 6-fold CV with
stratified sampling was used. To compare the
performance of NN, SVM, k-Nearest neighbors (k-NN)
and Naïve-Bayes (NB) models [50] were created using
the datasets generated following four feature extraction
methods. SVM represents a framework interesting from
a machine learning perspective. A SVM is a linear or
non-linear classifier and a mathematical function that is
preferred to distinguish two different classes. In pattern
recognition or classification, the k-NN algorithm is a
technique for classifying objects based on the closest
training examples in the problem space. k-NN is a type
of instance-based learning, or lazy learning where the
function is approximated locally and all computation is
deferred until classification. NB is a set of supervised
algorithm based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the
naive assumption of independence between features
[48].
Whereas in this research, various machine learning
approaches and four feature extraction methods were
combined in order to reveal the outperforming model.
Therefore, especially for RT applications of nonlinear
systems it is valuable and vital to generate a hybrid
model prior to model selection process. The results
given in table 2 highlights the significance and necessity
of the process followed in our study. Since the
performance of NN outperforms compared to the other
classifiers, NN model was used for task classification.

Another important parameter to control convergence
speed is momentum. During the calculation of weightchange value, a fraction of the previous change is
added. The main idea is to keep the variations of
weights going faster in the same direction. Momentum
is usually set between 0.1 and 0.9. Former studies
underlined that 0.9 is a reasonable choice [48]. In
addition, three other levels “0.3, 0.5, 0.7” were set for
the experiments conducted. The result of the
experiments with the momentum value “0.7”
outperformed compared to other values, therefore it was
assigned as “0.7” for the momentum parameter.
4.1. Modelling and Cross Validation
To eliminate overfitting, it is a common to hold out part
of the available data as a test set when performing a
supervised learning experiment. such as NN. While
evaluating “hyper parameters” for the predictive models
there is still a risk of overfitting on the test set since the
parameters could be tweaked until the estimator
performs optimally. Thus, the information could “leak”
into the model and the evaluation metrics then no longer
report on generalization performance. In order to
overcome the problem, whole data is split into 3 parts.
Firstly, 70% of the data is processed as training set
while the remaining data is split into equally sized
“validation set” and “test set”. The training set was first
used to fit the models and the validation set was then
used to estimate prediction error for model selection.
Finally, the test set was used for assessment of the
generalization error of the final chosen model. Since
partitioning the available data into three separate sets,

Following the modeling process, the performance of
each feature extraction method was assessed for each
mental task group as given in table 3. The mental task
classes are classified as; Recite the alphabet backwards

in table 3, WPD performed quite satisfactory
classification performance almost for all task classes.
WFB method has shown the best classification
performance in discriminating "2-3", “2-4” numbered
classes, however it has shown worst classification
performance in "1-3", "1-4”, respectively.

short period of time is distracting, the switching
between 4 tasks after 30 seconds, so that the user could
concentrate on a specific task and maintain the stability
of the active task, was tried. The dual task combination
is given in figure 3. Here, the user initiated the test from
a starting point to reach 4 different targets. The
reference trajectories are plotted as dashed lines and the
system output is plotted as straight colored lines. For
each target, the user restarted the process. As each target
is accessed, the new trajectory is given to the user. For
the first target, T1, the user is supposed to imagine the
tasks to move the green ball to T1 by reciting the
alphabet backwards and imagining the rotation of a
cube. Later, for target T2, the user focused on the tasks
reciting the alphabet backwards to move the green ball
up and imagining of right hand movements to move the
green ball right respectively. In order to move the green
ball to target T3, the user focused on performing
mathematical operations to move the ball down and
imagined rotation of a cube to move the ball left
respectively. Finally, the user made mathematical
operations to move the ball down and later imagined
right hand movement tasks to move the ball right for
target T4.

The WPD method is also good for classifying "2-3”, "24” numbered tasks. STFT and MWT revealed the worst
performance in the classification of "1-3", "1-4”, “3-4”,
“1-2-3”, “1-3-4”, “2-3-4” numbered tasks. Table 4 gives

4.2. Simulation Experiments
Following the model generation process, various
experiments were performed to demonstrate the efficacy
of the model performance. Firstly, triple combination of
the tasks was tested to observe the switching ability of
the model. Later, four of the tasks were used
consecutively to test the overall RT tracking
performance. In figure 2, the reference trajectory is
followed using “reciting the alphabet backwards (UP),
imagination of right hand movements (RIGHT) and
performing mathematical operation (DOWN).
4.3. Real-time Experiments
Following the simulation process, the reference
trajectories are set as given in figure 3 and 4 to test RT
tracking performance. Since repeated switching in a

Completing the first step, second step of RT trajectory
tracking experiments was performed as depicted in
figure 4. Here, a reference with step inputs was set and
the user switched between the tasks considering the
trajectory. Each axis is represented with the number of
pixels. The model output is plotted as red line. First, the
reference trajectory was defined and presented to the
user on the screen. Then, the user with wireless EEG
neuro-headset was instructed to imagine the related task
to move the ball on the reference trajectory. The arrows
exhibit the direction of the reference trajectory. As it is
seen from the system output, the user selects the proper
task to move to the related direction. Complete set of
four tasks were employed and all directions were visited
successively. Therefore, the user could switch from one
task to another to complete the loop. That was a critical
step for the user to evaluate both the switching ability
and overall classification performance of the system for
all four tasks. In case of misclassification or decrease of
concentration the model could deviate from the
trajectory. That is why the calculated classification
accuracy is 92% and the reflection of that accuracy is
depicted on the figure as deviations. Because of the lack
of concentration and misclassification, the model output
did not completely fit on the trajectory but from the
figure given below, it is possible to deduce that the RT
performance of the generated model is quite
satisfactory.

results showed that the WPD algorithm generates
comparatively better classification accuracy rates 92%
for all mental tasks together. STFT algorithm on the
other hand generated the worst classification
performance with 67% for all mental tasks. Early
studies revealed that the use of the STFT and MWT to
extract reliable features from EEG signals outperforms
in Motor Imagery tasks classification [50]. Similar other
studies underlined that better classification performance
could be achieved with STFT and MWT methods on
motor imagery tasks rather than visual, mental imagery
tasks not related with motor activity of the brain.
Studies specifically focus on those tasks, because they
strongly involve hemispheric brainwave asymmetry. In
a recent study, it was underlined that arithmetic tasks
exhibit a higher power spectrum in the right hemisphere
while visual tasks do so in the left hemisphere [49].
Thus, feature vector extracted by WPD method
performed better classification accuracy to discriminate
"Cube" and "MathOp" tasks. Mapping brain activity
patterns were studied in recent decades and contributes
to development process of BCI design. This type of
interface is extremely useful for disabled subjects where
one can control robotic systems that assist nonfunctional body members. Part of the studies in this area
focuses on noninvasive interfaces, in order to broaden
the interface usage to a larger number of users without
surgical risks. Thus, the purpose of this study focused
on assessing the performance of different feature
extraction methods to classify four different mental
tasks using EEG signals. The use of an efficient method
based on time-frequency representations was of vital
importance of the researchers for future studies. Future
work will utilize for applying these promising methods
to RT BCI systems. A real environment could be
designed to perform grasping tasks for daily used
objects using task classification. In this sense, a
pneumatic gripper could be attached to the robotic
system as end effector. The control strategies could also
be improved using fuzzy controller to reduce the
positioning error, when necessary.

5. Conclusion
This study has underlined the methods used for feature
extraction of EEG signals to be used to classify mental
tasks in order to be applied to a BCI application.
Following the feature extraction procedure, the
classification of the patterns based on the timefrequency spectrum features were carried out using NN.
We confirmed that the WPD approach is more proper
feature extraction technique. However, each timefrequency feature extraction method has weak and
strong sides compared to each other. The experimental
