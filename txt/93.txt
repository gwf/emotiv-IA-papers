EEG and Sonic Platforms to Enhance Mindfulness Meditation
Caitilin de Berigny1, Freya Zinovieff2, Karen Cochrane1, Youngdong Kim1, Zhepeng Rui1
ABSTRACT
Extensive research into the wide-reaching benefits of mindfulness is currently taking place in the
fields of psychology and neuroscience. Parallel to this, cutting edge technologies are becoming
more accessible. This article documents a new movement in Human-Computer interaction design in
which artists and designers are employing new technologies to research and explore the practice of
mindfulness. This paper explores three interactive designs that encourage mindfulness through
sensors and novel input technology. We begin by giving an overview of the historical background of
the Electroencephalogram (EEG), before going on to discuss the physiological processes of
meditation and the history behind the clinical practice of mindfulness. We show how two artists are
employing EEG sensors that measure the electrical activity of the brain to visualise mindfulness
meditation practices. A design that uses respiration sensors to record the breath patterns of the
user to trigger distinct soundscapes that directly relate to the correlation between breath and
meditative state is then discussed. Lastly, we conclude by debating the future of the three artworks.

Introduction

In 2014 Time Magazine declared that the far-reaching cultural and academic interest in mindfulness is
such that we have entered the age of the Mindful Revolution. Buddhists have coveted the practice of
mindfulness for centuries, since the 1970’s there has been an increase in interest in the psychological
and physical benefits of mindfulness practice in fields as diverse as design, education and modern
warfare training. In the fields of psychology and neuroscience there is deluge of new research into how
mindfulness can benefit our daily lives. We notice a correlation between the growing cultural interest in
mindfulness practices and the increasing pace of technological progress. Contemporary western
societies are saturated with ever growing and evolving technologies; our bodies have become
embedded with, and connected to technology in such a way that the boundaries between the
biological and the digital have become intertwined. Although technology can fracture our attention, it

can provide design tools, methods and practices that help focus our attention in highly engaging ways.
We demonstrate a new movement amongst artists and designers working at the intersection of
mindfulness and emerging technologies. In order to explore how technology is being used to promote
mindfulness and bring our attention back to the present moment we examine three sensor-driven
installation art applications: Narcissus Brainwave (2016), Visualise your Mind (2015), and Sonic Cradle
(2012).

Methodology

This paper acts as a resource to scholars at the emerging intersections of human-computer interaction
design, sonic studies and mindfulness studies. It also contributes to the fields of healthcare and
psychology and argues that more research into the potential for EEG headsets and Sonic Sensors to
promote mindfulness practices needs to be conducted. Through analysis of the following research
questions we show how the visualisation and sonification of mindfulness has the potential to enhance
meditative experiences.
 In what ways can artists use sensors to encourage the practice of mindfulness?
 Do wireless EEG devices have the potential to help mindfulness?
 Interactive design has the potential to engage with and inspire the user: how can this potential
be employed to promote the practice of mindfulness?
In order to contextualise this research we first trace the fleeting and fascinating history of the EEG and
show how EEG headsets are employed by researchers to measure the specific electrical activity of the
brain. We then take the reader on a brief tour of the history of mindfulness practice before elucidating
how designers and artists are using Brain-computer interface devices that use EEGs. Narcissus
Brainwave and Visualise Your Mind are two interactive designs that use EEG headsets. Sonic Cradle is an
interactive sensor-driven design that has the potential to use EEG sensors in the future. The three
projects in this paper used qualitative thematic analysis to analyse the user’s needs. The data was then
grouped into themes that described the success of each project. We conclude by discussing future
directions for the three projects. More detailed description of each methodology used for the projects
is in the sections below.

Background on EEGs

We begin our journey with a history into how technology has been used to record brainwave data.
Research findings, generated using EEG sensor based technology, have revolutionised discoveries in
neuroplasticity. Moreover, the changes in the human brain resulting from mindfulness meditation
practices can now be visualised and understood in new tangible ways due to EEG headsets.
In 1924 Hans Berger recorded the first human brain activity by an EEG. EEG sensors measure the
electrical activity of the brain. Brain cells communicate by producing electrical signals; an EEG measures
this activity. Berger was trained in medicine and neuro-psychiatry. Berger wanted to demonstrate that
the electromagnetic fields of the human brain could be used for telepathy. Although the signals he
detected were unsuccessful for this purpose, the EEG was widely adopted by clinicians and scientists.
Brainwaves observed with an EEG allow researchers to record brain wave patterns. Humans have five
brainwaves: Gamma Beta, Alpha, Theta, Delta. The frequency of the brainwave is associated with its
speed and measured in cycles per second. Different frequencies indicate different types of
activities. Delta waves have a very low frequency (below 4 hertz) which occur during sleep. Alpha
waves, 8 to 13 hertz, occur during relaxed times. Beta waves, 15 to 40 hertz, are the next fastest, and
they occur when actively thinking. Gamma waves (greater than 40 hertz) have the
highest frequency and are involved in higher mental activity.

Gamma waves and meditation

Each brainwave serves a unique purpose and helps us to cope with various situations, whether it is to
facilitate the process of learning new information, or to help us calm down after a long stressful day.
Our ability to move through the different brain wave frequencies plays a large role in how successful
we are at managing stress, focusing on tasks, and getting a good night’s sleep. If one of the five types
of brain waves is either overproduced or under produced in our brain it causes problems.
Gamma waves are the fastest brain waves measured on an EEG. Gamma waves relate to the speed we
mentally process experiences, and our ability to focus, and richness and depth of sensory
experiences. People with high gamma activity have exceptionally vivid and rapid memory recall. In a
high gamma state the brain can process information quickly, remember it, and retrieve it later. High
gamma activity corresponds to a state of peak performance. Elite athletes, musicians and high
achievers in all fields produce more gamma waves than average.
Gamma waves have been documented to help with attention and focus (Collura, 1993). Individuals with
high level mental processing and functioning exhibit greater gamma activity (Fries, 2001; Jia X, 2011; YiYuan Tang 2007). Gamma waves are important for learning, memory and information processing.
Neuroscientists believe that gamma waves link information from all parts of the brain. Thus, the entire
brain is influenced by gamma waves.
In a study with Buddhist monks, it was found that gamma activity increased in a meditative state of
compassion (Jia X, 2011). Some research suggests that mindfulness meditation enhances
compassionate behaviour (Davidson, 2004). A study that performed sleep high-density EEG recordings,
in long-term meditators of Buddhist meditation practices and meditation naive individuals, indicates
that meditation practice produces measurable changes in brain activity. Therefore, meditation is the
optimum way to increase gamma activity.

Mindfulness

Research demonstrates that mindfulness can greatly enhance our health and wellbeing (Hofmann,
2010; Jha, 2007; Jon Kabat-Zinn, 1998; Lazar, 2011; Mitchell, 2013). The clinical practice known as
‘mindfulness’ has been around since 1979 when Jon Kabat-Zinn introduced his Mindfulness-Based
Stress Reduction (MBSR) program as part of the University of Massachusetts Medical School. KabatZinn adapted the Buddhist tradition of mindfulness for the clinical setting in order to help with
psychological conditions such as stress and chronic pain management.
Mindfulness dates back around 2600 years ago to the beginning of Buddhism. The Buddha’s teachings,
or Dharma, were not a doctrinal belief system, rather a collection of principles and practices that offer

http://www.theartsjournal.org/index.php/site/index

3

Berigny et al, JAH (2016), Vol. 05, No. 09: 1-12

support and encouragement in the universal quest for happiness and spiritual freedom; a “system of
training that leads to insight and the overcoming of suffering” (Williams & Kabat-Zinn, 2011).
Buddhist meditation encompasses a variety of meditation techniques that aim to develop mindfulness,
concentration, tranquillity, and insight. Increasingly, non-Buddhists are adopting Buddhist meditation
techniques. Psychologists and psychiatrists are increasingly using these techniques to help alleviate a
variety of health conditions such as anxiety and depression.
The etymology of the word ‘mindfulness’ can be traced to the concept of Sati (Pali) or Smrti (Sanskrit).
There has been much debate surrounding the exact translation of smrti and sati and while mindfulness
is generally accepted as a broad translation, the grand semantic breadth of each word must be taken
into consideration when looking for a direct translation. The cultivation of Sati, or non-judgmental
mindful-awareness, sits at the core of Buddhist practice. To practice mindfulness is possible without
Buddhism but the practice of Buddhism is not possible without mindfulness. According to Jon KabatZinn“ Mindfulness practice means that we commit fully in each moment to be present; inviting
ourselves to interface with this moment in full awareness, with the intention to embody as best we can
an orientation of calmness, mindfulness, and equanimity right here and right now.”(Williams & KabatZinn, 2011)
John Kabat-Zin describes mindfulness as way to understand the events of our lives with equanimity. He
proposes that by maintaining an attitude of non-judgmental direct observation and keeping attention
to the present moment we are able to see more clearly the characteristics of our mind and body
process (Jon Kabat-Zinn, 2009). To practice mindfulness means being continuously aware of the
present moment; the following interactive designs are built to enable users to do this.

Brain-computer interface devices that use EEGs and Sonic Platforms

We believe that interactive design and art applications have the potential to engage with and inspire a
user to practice mindfulness. The first art works we discuss are Narcissus Brainwave and Visualise your
Mind. They are both brain-computer interfaces that encourage mindfulness meditation though an EEG
device. The participant’s EEG data is recorded using a headset called the NeuroSky MindWave. The
MindWave is an EEG that uses dry sensors. The NeuroSky was used to give participants feedback of
their brainwave activities while undertaking mindful-based activities. The visualization of the
participants’ brainwaves provided a tool to help develop mindfulness practice.
Sonic Cradle, the third project, does not currently use an EEG headset but uses two respiration sensors
that track diaphragm and chest breathing. However, in future iterations of the project, the team is
planning to incorporate another EEG headset similar to the MindWave called Muse. Therefore, we still
believe it is an important project to discuss when analysing how interactive installation art can
encourage mindfulness.
In the following three examples we sought to discover whether EEG devices and other biofeedback
devices have the ability to encourage the practice of mindfulness in users. We discuss how interactive
applications support and promote the practice of mindfulness through direct visual brainwave data
feedback and sound based interaction. We examine how wireless EEG devices can engage the user and
promote the practice mindfulness. We outline three novel installation artworks that sought to
incorporate human-computer interaction to encourage the practice of mindfulness.

Narcissus brainwave

Narcissus Brainwave (Figure 2 and 3) is a compelling example that promotes mindfulness through the
use of a novel sensor-driven design that visualises the users’ brainwaves while they meditate. The
installation uses the EEG headset MindWave. Users are invited to wear the MindWave headset and sit in
meditation. EEG data is sent to the program processing through the MindWave device. After they have

meditated, Narcissus Brainwave displays their brainwaves during the different states of meditation they
had endured. The participant’s brainwave data creates digital paintings based on Tibetan Buddhism
Mandala patterns. The aesthetic visualisation patterns of Mandalas were created to enable users to
discern different brainwave states of meditation. In Carl Jung’s understanding of the Mandala, it is a
psychological expression of the totality of the self (Jung,1972).
The first user study was conducted to develop the visualisation rules that would enable an evaluation of
brainwave changes between meditative and non-meditative state. Raw data from the MindWave was
collected to distinguish four states of mind which were then represented as visualisations (a, b, c, and
d) respectively). By correlation of these factors, the size and pattern of the Mandala pattern was
determined.
Figure 2: Narcissus Brainwave (2016) Young dong Kim. (A) Distraction: the Mandala breaks into 8 divisions from
the center and expands outward – this break symbolises the dissolution of the Tibetan sand Mandala at
completion. (B) Relaxed: The user is trying to meditate. (C) Meditation status: Mandala pattern appears. The
size of mandala represents how deep the meditation status is. (D) Deep meditation status: An eternal knot
appears when the gamma brainwave’s amplitude exceeds a certain level.

User study two was designed to analyse the discernibility of the visualisation patterns. 7 out of the 11
participants were able to discern differences between the visualisation patterns.
Participants viewed the pre-recorded visualisation patterns of meditators and were asked to evaluate
them. The majority of participants (7 out of 11) could differentiate between the patterns of meditators
and non-meditators. Through user study two, it was also reported that colour theme, scale of pattern
and the rate of change are important factors to differentiate between the visualised patterns
representing the different levels of meditative state. A colour theme was set to distinguish each
brainwave with the highest amplitude to enable users to recognise their brainwave status, also the
scale of the pattern (expansion or contraction) was subsequently set to monitor status changes in
meditation.
The audience can view the user’s individual brainwave-visualisation as the user meditates in situ, it can
also be viewed after the meditation experience is over. By using EEG sensors to visualise brainwave
data the user is able to see how their meditation status changed during the session. The ‘rate of
change’ is the time required to reach the different levels of meditation. Meditators, who are more
experienced practitioners, take less time to attain a meditative state. Narcissus Brainwave allows users
to distinguish between meditative and non-meditative states through a logical, aesthetic approach.
Narcissus Brainwave uses patterns to integrate multiple dimensions of information instead of viewing
graphs of brainwave data. The final visualisation rules have been made based on a conceptual model of
the meditation stages. User testing and an interactive development process validate the discernibility
of visualisation patterns of meditators and non-meditators.

Figure 3: Narcissus Brainwave (2016). Top and Bottom shows individual visualization viewed by the audience
and then by the user after meditating.

Narcissus Brainwave has the potential to enable practitioners a greater understanding of the effects of
meditation on their brainwave activity. By viewing how their mind state changes dynamically during
meditation, users can explore the effect of various meditation techniques and discover the ones that
are most beneficial for their practice. For non-meditators, the use of this tool enables them to perceive
brainwave changes as soon as they start meditation. This immediate feedback can encourage and
inspire people who hesitate to practice meditation because of the perceived prejudice that meditation
is hard to attain. This may give encouragement and inspiration to the users. Non-meditators may be
curious whether the custom-made software program is showing their meditation states properly or
not. With this curiosity, they will continuously use the software and experience benefits of mindfulness.
Users who have a MindWave headset can access and download the published software easily.

Visualise your mind

Visualise your Mind (Figure 4) is a new platform to visualise brain wave data in meditation using EEG
sensor technology. This project incorporated two different ways of interacting with EEGs headsets. In
the first interaction, users put on an EEG headset while meditating and are then able to view their

brainwaves in a visualisation chart (see Figure 5 left). It is intended that the visualisation chart be used
to evaluate and promote the users meditation practice. In the second interaction using EEG headsets,
users can create abstract paintings using their brainwave data during meditation (see figure 6).The data
visualisation patterns reveal users’ live brainwave data: alpha, beta, gamma, theta, delta waves and
meditation and attention levels. As a result users could monitor their progress in meditation, and create
abstract paintings using data from their own brainwaves. The artworks in Visualise your Mind were
controlled directly by users brainwave data. In order to distinguish the meditative state of the users
brainwave data, the chakra colours system was adopted. Chakra colours use seven different colour
schemes (Figure 6). Violet was depicted for the highest meditation state because it has the strongest
wavelength (Wills, 2014).Magenta, the combination of red and violet, was used to depict meditators
deepest relaxation stage (Figure 6).
Figure 5: (Left) Wave patterns’ colour, frequency and amplitude. Different colours depict different meditation
values used to create the Mind Painting artwork. (Right) Users recorded data visualisation chart.

In order to develop Visualise your Mind, a user needs analysis study was conducted. Firstly we analysed
the design requirements for an application and website. Secondly we collated experts' and users'
suggestions to find appropriate mindfulness tutorials. The user study contained an online qualitative
questionnaire and interviews with 42 participants. We used thematic analysis to group the data into
themes and develop the design concept. The results from the user study found most participants were
less informed about EEG brainwave data, but had literacy about websites and apps.

The website and mobile applications were designed to be used in correlation with the EEG headset
MindWave. Users were encouraged to use an EEG headset while they practiced the mindful-based
tutorials. From the users’ needs analyse study, the website and mobile application were developed to
include mindful-based tutorials such as guided meditations and relaxation exercises, created by Patty

Kikos and Tripura Yoga. From the mindful-based tutorials, the user study revealed participants
preferred the breathing exercises and body scans featured in the tutorials.
Visualise your Mind promotes mindfulness using novel EEG sensors, input and output technology to
generate brainwave data. It also promotes mindfulness through the use of its website and phone
application.

8.0 Sonic cradle: A sound-based interaction for mindfulness
Sonic Cradle (Figure 7) is an interactive design invention that encourages the user to enter a state of
mindfulness meditation using spatial sound. It aims to “intentionally promote the specific pattern of
awareness and attention characteristic of mindfulness meditation” (Kornfield, New edition, December
1989) in an easily accessible way. The user is suspended in a hammock within a darkened chamber fitted
with respiratory biofeedback sensors to initiate and guide the surrounding sound. By focusing on a realtime correlation between respiration and the sonic experience the user is offered a tangible creative
mode through which an understanding of the relationships between breath and meditation is made
possible. Within this contemplative space, usually filled by external distraction, the user has the
opportunity to focus on their inner sensations and how it relates to their cognitive and emotional
wellbeing.
Much like the previous work we discussed, Narcissus Brainwave and Visualise your Mind, this interactive
design transforms the unseen effects of meditation practice into a sensory commodity. Unlike the
innovative designs using EEG devices, Sonic Cradle was initially created as an interactive medium that
uses no visual stimulation. However, it is important to discuss this piece as it assists us in uncovering
our research questions on how we can design mindful-technologies in human-computer interaction.
The absence of visual stimuli and the suspension of the user are both design concepts that aim to free
the user of external distraction and interoceptive senses in order to facilitate full concentration on
internal sensations.
The creator of Sonic Cradle Jay Vidyarthi, designed a Max 6 patch. The respiration data is then sent
through the patch to create an individualised soundscape that is played through four Mackie MR5MK2
speakers surrounding the chair and a large subwoofer situated below it. Two respiration sensors are
attached to participants’ abdomen and thorax to measure chest expansion (Thought Technology’s
SA9311M and ProComp2 encoder: 32 Hz) (Vidyarthi, 2012).
Figure 6:Sonic Cradle (2014).

(Vidyarthi, 2012). From the speakers an evolving spatial soundscape emerges. The system enables the
user to create different sounds by breathing in different ways, using their breath to shape and form the
pre-recorded clips into their own personal meditation soundtrack. The clips randomly play through
different speakers to keep the soundscape individualised and interesting for the user. The goal of the
experience is to use the participants’ prior knowledge and their psychological attributes to keep them

http://www.theartsjournal.org/index.php/site/index

EEG and sonic platforms to enhance mindfulness meditation

engaged and generate an individual immersive sound experience(Vidyarthi, 2012).
Sonic Cradle’s sounds are designed to guide the user back to their breath and on-going enquiry into the
influence the breath has on the heard environment. Originally, the sounds were created by the artist,
however, the sounds were too similar and therefore, thirty sounds were crowd sourced from different
musicians and sound artists(Vidyarthi, 2012). When mental distractions arise the user’s breath will
continue to influence the surrounding sound, retriggering focus on the sound-breath loop.
When the users’ hold their breath for a full 4 seconds, the user will feel vibrations from the subwoofer
and a chime. Then, a new sound will be added to the experience. As the soundscape gets more
complex, the user has to hold their breath for longer periods of time making it harder to call upon new
sounds. This creative process will enable the user to explore the immersive experience with their
breath (Vidyarthi, 2012).
Timing and ratio is also influence in the soundscape. The length of the inhale and the exhale manipulate
the reverberation of the sound. For example, if the participant takes a slow breath, they will feel like
they are in a larger room. If the participant breathes from their abdominal area more than their chest,
they will experience a louder sound.
However, if the user gets overwhelmed with the number of sounds, they are able to breathe rapidly to
get the sounds to disappear. This gives the user a constant sense of control over their own
environment(Vidyarthi, 2012). Figure 7 describes the tangible similarities between a typical mindfulness
meditation practice and the paradigm created by Sonic Cradle.
Sonic Cradle was subject to a qualitative investigation with 39 selected participants at the TED active
conference in Palm Springs, California 2012. Participants were grouped into those who had no
meditation experience and those who had some experience. A short interview was conducted after the
experience. A subsequent systematic analysis that used three independent data coders resulted in the
following report of 14 primary themes that emerged in the participants’ use of Sonic Cradle.
Common themes for both beginners and those who had some experience included: relaxation, floating
sensation, exploration of the soundscape, yearning to continue the experience, visual imagery in their
mind, bodily sensations, loss of time, meditative-state, association with other meditative practices,
semi-conscious state, and revelations and discoveries. Interestingly, only those with some meditation
experience noted an intense engagement with sound. Similarly, those in this group also noted a direct
correlation between the Sonic Cradle experience and that of meditative practice. Only those in the no
meditation experience group noted feeling personal epiphanies (Vidyarthi, 2012).
Much as Narcissus Brainwave, has the potential to provide non-meditators with non-judgmental and
tangible feedback regarding their meditative practice, so Sonic Cradle has the opportunity to encourage
and inspire users to take up the practice of meditation.
As the creator of Sonic Cradle Jay Vidyarthi notes, a feeling of failure can be common in those starting
out on their meditation journey. The lack of formal instruction regarding meditation while using Sonic
Cradle is intentional: the continued sonification of the breath process provides a situation whereby the
user is perpetually reminded of their breathing-state. “The Sonic Cradle interaction paradigm aims to
enable the calm refocusing of attention to proceed unencumbered as a natural response to the
interaction paradigm, potentially providing an experience which parallels more advanced mindfulness
practitioners” (Vidyarthi & Riecke, 2014).

Figure 7:Jay Vidyarthi, Mindfulness Meditation Practice versus Sonic Cradle Interaction Paradigm (2014).

As we have already seen, Narcissus Brainwave and Visualise your Mind in generously transform the actual
physical imprint of meditative data into visual data. One of the exciting questions that Sonic Cradle
unveils sits at the intersection of design, psychology and the sonic experience: can meditation really
help us to listen better?
The surprising result of an “intense engagement with sound” reported by users with some meditation
experience suggests that more enquiry is needed. According to H. Ellie Falter mindful practice
techniques can be employed to deepen sonic understanding and enhance our connection to music
(Falter, 2016). The intimacy of sound has the potential to change the way we experience time and blur
the edges of our physical and mental perception. Similarly, the practice of mindfulness has been shown
to have the potential to expand our notions of consciousness, enhance somatic awareness, and thus
enable a greater mind-body harmony. Sonic Cradle uses interactive technology to highlight the aesthetic
experience of listening in order to remind us of the timelessness of presence. Within this perpetual
continuation of ‘now’ a narrative is revealed that enables us to consider time as a type of infinite object
(Zinovieff, 2013). The sound that is experienced in Sonic Cradle can therefore be viewed as a tool that
enables a direct relationship to the infinite nature of both time and consciousness. This humancomputer paradigm truly is at the cutting edge of interaction design.

Future work and Conclusion

As consumer EEG technology continues to increase in reliability, two of the projects discussed in this
paper will continue to evolve in an iterative design process. Visualise your Mind is currently being
developed further to be supported by the Emotiv for a research study with 100 Junior Medical Officers
(doctors) to discover if using the visual feedback from the EEG device will help develop their meditation
practice. This research project is aimed at increasing the resilience of junior medical officers. It also
seeks to generate results from an eight-week compassion focused mindfulness meditation course. If
successful, this will support a wide spread roll-out across New South Wales Health’s junior medical
workforce. Secondary benefits may accrue to patients in the form of (a) more empathic doctors and
(b) physicians who have become personally familiar with mindfulness meditation and thus better able
to identify patients who may also benefit from the practice. This project will be innovative in some
areas over and of the growing interest in mindfulness meditation-based techniques to enhance
resilience and reduce stress. The research study will use EEG’s for enhancement to improve practice,
engagement in mindfulness in an occupational setting.
Visualise your Mind currently uses the Neurosky Mindwave headset, however, due to the limitations of
the device, it is not suitable for clinical use. The headset has a sampling rate of 1Hz and only has one
electrode positioned on the forehead. The wide error margin for the data is a huge issue when testing
for reliability in the data. In a current future study of Visualise your Mind will we use the Emotiv Insight
headset. EMOTIV Insight is a 5-channel, wireless EEG headset that records brainwave data. The Insight
has a wider distribution of sensors surrounding the head and therefore offers greater data accuracy.

EEG and sonic platforms to enhance mindfulness meditation

Sonic Cradle provided an immersive soundscape that assisted users to focus on their breathing rather
than thoughts and experiences. One of the most common negative comments that participants had
while interactive with the soundscape was their distaste for specific sounds. Currently, there is no
recorded pattern to which sounds the users were irritated with (Vidyarthi & Riecke, 2014). Therefore, in
future iterations, the group of artists working on the project want to incorporate EEG data from the
Interaxon Muse headset. The muse headset enables the system to know when the user is in a state of
focused attention. With the new data, the artists are looking at removing distracting sounds from the
soundscape and playing with the volume depending on what type of meditative state the participant is
currently experiencing.
This article has outlined three innovative interaction design and art applications that use breathing
sensors and EEGs to visulisalise and sonify brainwaves in order to encourage mindfulness. Though the
use of EEG and respiration data, we defined how applications have the potential to promote the
practice of mindfulness, especially for novice practitioners. The three examples illustrated novel ways in
which Interactive art can promote the practice of mindfulness through sensory installations using visual
and sonic stimuli. The success of Visualise your Mind and Narcissus Brainwave have shown that wireless
EEG devices do have the potential to improve and inspire mindfulness practice. We hope the three
pieces inspire new ideas to develop interactive visual and soundscapes that can keep a user on a path
to regular meditation sessions. We intend that this research inspires and informs the work of other
artists, designers, and researchers to develop applications that can assist both novice and experienced
meditators in their practice.
